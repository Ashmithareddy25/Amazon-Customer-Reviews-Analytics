B0007GAEW6|5.0|I love how most of the people who write bad reviews for good albums don't have a grasp on the English language.  It's always something like: <br /> <br />waht is this i totally dont uunerstan teh noyse i liked atdi but i go listen at britney detectit you tell me do tings i go an runnin <br /> <br />Anyway, this album is incredible and it creeps me out every time I listen to it.  I am equally compelled by the story as I am compelled by the music.  Anyone who didn't like this album should go listen to Sparta.  Because Sparta sounds a lot like another band I've heard of...  I can't quite put my finger on it...
B00005V3Z4|2.0|After watching the movie Donnie Crapo, I mean, Darko, it seems more clear to me, why the minds of so many people are totally screwed up.  Let's face it, the only reason why this movie deserves at least a two star rating is because of the awesome songs and fascinating musical arrangements. The rest of the film could be accurately filed under \\"Garbage Productions\\".
B000005RFN|5.0|\\"Never Say Die\\"(1978) is an album many people claim to dislike, but few have actually heard. While it is true that \\"Never Say Die\\" is quite different from the first four Sabbath albums, for those into \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", \\"Sabotage\\", and \\"Technical Ecstacy\\", \\"Never Say Die\\" is an ABSOLUTE MUST!!! The album displays the versatility and quality song writing so many critics under-estimated during the 70's. The production is FLAWLESS and rivaled only by the production on \\"Sabotage\\". Just check out Iommi's AMAZING wah-pedal guitar tone in 'Junior's Eyes'!!! WOW!!! \\"Never Say Die\\" also features Ozzy's last truly GREAT vocal performance(until maybe \\"Ozzmosis\\" many years later). Like \\"Sabotage\\", \\"Never Say Die\\" is meant to be listened to as a whole. The songs run into one another making the album nearly like an acid trip. The album varies from exuberance('Never Say Die')-melancholy('Junior's Eyes')-intospection('Hard Road')-jazz('Air Dance')-heavy and spaced out('Johnny Blade' and 'Shock Wave'), making \\"Never Say Die\\" a dynamic listening experience. It is true that if you are simply looking for a rehash of 'War Pigs' or 'Paranoid' you WILL NOT find it on NSD. But for those of you who are TRUE Black Sabbath fanatics, \\"Never Say Die\\" is an album that the stoner gods FORBID you to pass up. So shell out a few bucks, get the lighting right, get the weed fired up(or if your really adventurous find some good blotter acid), crank your stereo up, sit back and enjoy an often-forgotten masterpiece from the band which epitomized the term 'buzz-worthy'. Check it out!!!!
B0001ENY6M|5.0|Let me start off by saying \\"I'm glad James Horner did not write this score.\\" Horner has been recycling a lot of his music lately. Hiring John Debney to score the film was not only good for Mel Gibson but for John Debney himself. The Passion gave John the opportunity to show the world his skills as a film music composer.<br /><br />The film was dark, depressing, gruesome, horrific at times, and sad. Somehow John found the emotional core of the film and exploited it.<br /><br />The album track is not listed in chronological order but its setup makes for a greater listening experience.<br /><br />After the opening track, we have the powerful song \\"Bearing the Cross.\\" This song is heard differently on the film but the album version is better. It starts off in depressing low, soft strings increasing in volume accompanied by a solo male singing the lyric-less vocals. The orchestra escalates in volume and accelerates in pace as Jesus carries the cross. The London Voices join in to add further tension and emotion to Christ's long journey to Golgatha. This is one of the best songs on the album.<br /><br />There really is no theme to the film but if there is, it would have to be Lisbeth Scott's solo vocal work on various tracks on the album. The most beautiful track on the album is \\"Mary Goes To Jesus.\\" This is the song one could point out to be the main theme of the film.<br /><br />\\"Crucifixion\\" follows the same powerful buildup as \\"Bearing the Cross.\\" \\"Crucifixion\\" is the most heart-wrenching song on the album. As the orchestra and chorus build the emotion to the slow, sad string part, one can feel their heart skip a beat as they recall the climax of the film. The music nearly makes one shed tears when the flute takes the lead in the piece.<br /><br />The last song on the album, \\"Resurrection\\", is triumphant signifying Christ's victory over death by rising from the dead. The song starts off quietly being interrupted occasionally by loud percussion. The percussion adds further triumph to the moment with the rising string accompaniment and blown into a victorious cry by the London Voices. The song ends with Lisbeth Scott's solo vocal.<br /><br />For those expecting to find the trailer music in the album will be disappointed; it's not on the disc. At about 55 minutes of running time, The Passion of the Christ is an excellent add to your collection. It captures the agony, the emotion, the passion, and the glory of the film.<br /><br />If you want to hear John Debney at the top of his game, buy CutThroat Island as well.string accompaniment and blown into a victorious cry by the London Voices.

B00004THAY|5.0|this is a powerhouse double effort by Eric Clapton and B.B. King, as they examine blues classics that BB often played when he was younger.  The results kick butt, because you have the double guitar attack which makes for a fine groove.  BB and Eric made great music by themselves, and putting them together releases some very wonderful work.  I highly recommend this to any fans of the blues, or of either of these musicians.  It is a terrific piece of swaggering blues, music with a true blues groove.
B000957O82|5.0|\\"You is a very fluid concept right now\\", states \\"Hitch\\", a dating consultant, who calls himself the \\"dating doctor\\".  Will Smith plays the lead in a role designed for him. The premise is as follows; \\"Hitch\\" is a dating consultant whose business is helping men sweep women off their feet.  He helps a variety of guys meet the love of their life by setting up circumstances to help get them noticed and on dates, and the rest is up to them.  The results are often hilarious.  One day \\"Hitch\\" meets a woman who sweeps him off his feet, and then his well designed strategies for others fail in some of the most memorable ways.<br /><br />While the movie is funny, and Will Smith is his typical self, this one has some real relationship depth to it.  The characters likable, and the courtships and dating are at times awkwardly realistic.  I think every man who watches the movie can relate to many of the awkward moments and cringe and laugh along.<br /><br />Of course the ending is a bit too easy, but still, it works.  This movie is not a masterpiece by any means, but it is enjoyable from the opening credits to the end.  In this day and age where most comedies have to resort to crass and offensive humor, this one is a gem.  Enjoy.

B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia is one of those wonderful films that goes beyond the <br />normal boundaries of film. Surprisingly the closest thing I can compare it to is the black and white D. W. Griffith classic 'Intolerance\\". <br />What Kubrick's Lolita did to have the viewer not just watch but experience paranoia, Magnolia does the same for the experience of synchronicity. <br />The movie is long but more than worth the time invested. <br />A number of stories are woven together. The movie has a definite point but does not preach. Instead it sucks you into to its reality with a pacing worthy of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. Rather than turn this review into a Kubrick lovefest I mention Barry Lyndon because of the masterful way the director slowed down the pace of the modern world to draw the viewer into the world of Thackary's Lyndon. Unlike Barry Lyndon though even though both movies are on the long side the pacing of Magnolia is far from slow. <br />Through the story of a number of stories in Magnolia we experience a whole new out look into the ordinary world, seeing it as a type of hyper-world, and after the movie we are left with the feeling that the world is not so ordinary after all. <br />The idea that our lives are interconnected is not a new one. However it is the subject of \\"coincidence\\" that is the predominant one. All of us have at one time or another experienced a coincidence. But what if our world was made up of a series of \\"coincidences\\" that had a logic to them. Call them a layers of rhythms that existence beyond our perceptions, call them synchronicity, call them the hand of God, in this movie we are prodded into experiencing ever so gently and with more than a little humor is that something is going on. <br />This is not a conspiracy of nations or shadowy groups we find ourselves commonly seeing in many of today's movies but conspiracies of the universe. And it is not a necessarily disinterested synchronicity in play as there is definitely a touch of karma at play and in the end redemption. The true art of this movie is that we are not told a story we experience it. <br />To summarize the story is to not do it justice however I offer this brief synopsis. <br /> <br />The movie is begun with a narator telling the story of three strange incidents in history and then the story begins. <br /> <br />  A famous powerful ancient TV game show producer, Earl Partridge, is dying-his death is eminent. He made his fortune in a game show that exploited brainy children. His young wife is addicted to drugs and racked with guilt. Meanwhile Partridge's caring but somewhat emotionally fragile male nurse trys frantically to contact Partridge's son, who is the misogynistic leader of a cult like self improvement group dedicated to taking advantage of women and who disowned his father long ago. Partridge's game show heir, Jimmy Gator, continues the show. He too is dying of cancer. The part of the wreckage of lives Partridge and Gator leave in their wake is the now over the hill Whiz-kid Donnie Smith (played magnificently by William H. Macy) and the current Whiz kid Stanley. All both Stanley and Donnie want is to be loved. In the meantime Gator's daughter, a victim of her father's abuse , attempts to finally have a normal relationship with someone who is caring and human. As twisted as this plot sounds even more twists are revealed.  <br /> Although this may sound somewhat like a soap opera it is far from superficial and along with revealing a hyper-real vision of the world in which we live tackles such issues as forgiveness, redemption and damnation without sounding like a Christian sermon. It is what Robert Anton Wilson called \\"chapel perilous\\". You may never be the same after seeing this film. <br />The sound track by Aimee Mann greatly adds to the movie. <br /> <br />\\"The book says, we might be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />  Weird, wise and wonderful. <br /> <br />
B00007E8V4|4.0|Don't really have a review...I just wanted to respond to the poster calling himself \\"Rotten.\\" Hey man, what the hell does \\"retarted\\" mean?  Does you mean that System have baked a tart twice?  Or, perhaps, that they have a penchant for picking up women of questionable moral fiber more than once?  Or, is it that you simply cannot spell (as you are, obviously, a dullard)?  <br />If you enjoy System of a Down's nearly atonal metal, you will like this album. Please ignore the morons (I'm looking at you, Rotten).
B000002J09|5.0|This is the greatest cd of all time with such great songs as black dog, rock and roll, stairway to heaven, and going to california. but all the music on here has been reviewed several times so I am here to tell you about a new band you have to hear, their name is Rose Hill Drive. People are saying these guys are the next led zeppelin, and the band does everything to prove it. I mean they are not as good as zeppelin, I don't think any one ever will be but this guys still rock. People say they bring it like zeppelin live and you can tell when you listen to there live demo. <br />    The band is a trio and have played with many rock greats including Van Halen.  They do not have a full length album out yet but I heard that they will soon. If you go on there website though you can buy a live demo of their's with seven songs.  <br />    The band is comprised of two brothers and there childhood friend. One of the brothers plays lead guitar, one plays bass and sings, and the friend plays the drums. The lead guitarist plays like a god with a sound all his own. The singer has a good voice and keeps the bass lines flowing and the drummer is incredible to. They don't copy any other bands sound either. <br />    So if you are trying to find the next rock gods look no further then rose hill drive. check out their website at [...] and buy their cd, you won't be sorry, trust me. Another great new band to check out is silvertide. <br /> <br />
B00005NTN5|5.0|I picked up this movie for all the wrong reasons (and at least one right reason - the critics seemed to like it).  Oh goody, I thought, a movie with lesbians making out.  Well, I came away from the experience of watching the film slightly confused by my reaction.  The nature of the women's attraction to each other was an integral part of the movie, and there was an interesting nude love scene, but the movie itself was a lot better than I expected, almost to the point where I was almost actually  annoyed that they \\"ruined\\" the picture by descending to the level of \\"needing\\" to show that nude scene.  I never particularly liked two of the three above/before the title stars, and picked up the DVD despite that fact.  I was surprised, though, by how well they acted in the film, and how engrossing the plot turned out to be.  Watching Jennifer Tilly (Violet) and Gina Gershon (Corky) attempting to steal some money from Tilly's mob boyfriend Joe Pantoliano (Ceasar (as spelled on the screen)) was actually pretty interesting.   <br /> <br />Pantoliano is just holding the money, a transfer station if you will, and part of the plan is to frame Panoliano for the fall, thereby \\"freeing\\" Tilly from his grasp.  It is interesting watching the women working to try to make their plan work, and watching Pantoliano trying to save himself.     <br /> <br />As I somewhat mentioned, the film's above/before the title stars are Jennifer Tilly (\\"Bullets Over Broadway,\\" \\"Bride of Chucky\\"), Gina Gershon (\\"Showgirls\\", \\"Blink\\") and Joe Panoliano (\\"The Fugitive,\\" \\"The Matrix\\").  The movie is the Wachowski brothers' directorial debut (\\"The Matrix\\"; had not known this was one of their movies until after I saw the movie).  The movie was rated R for violence, torture, profanity, nudity, and simulated sex, though the DVD is unrated.   <br /> <br />Oh right, almost forgot.  The DVD contains the movie, several language options, the trailer and audio commentary from the directors, the editor, and an extra (Susie Bright, a Lesbian-erotica author and technical advisor) (interesting, the directors kind of sound like that comic Steven Wright (hope have the right name), though only kind of have similar sound).

0670033375|3.0|First of all, Jared Diamond states in the preface that he considers himself a 'moderate environmentalist.'  For most of the book, he manages to stick to that description but there are a number of places where he betrays a lack of balance which suggests that some of the conclusions he draws throughout are not truly from an unbiased point of view.    Just as an example, in the last sentence of page 377, he speaks approvingly of China's ability to manage their population growth.  In an earlier part of the chapter he explicitly mentions China's forced-abortion and sterilization program.  Whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, it is tough to speak approvingly of any country that straps women down and forces them to have abortions and sterilization procedures.    Also, there have recently been competing theories on the destruction of the Easter Island population.  The newest is that Polynesian rats ate the seeds of the trees, thereby cutting off the reforestation.    There are a number of other examples, where he discusses the self-dealing of business executives but ignores the self-dealing of politicians, attorneys and/or union officials, etc.    Finally, I think he overemphasizes the role environmental factors play in the collapse of societies.  He largely makes the point that virtually every collapse of a society is at root because of environmental exploitation.  That simply overstates the case.    Nonetheless, it has its good points as well and it deserves a medium rating.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Having seen the musical on broadway, I waited breathlessly to see the movie. But as I held the DVD in my hand, for one moment I wondered if it could be even close to as good as the stage production. But, casting doubts aside, I slid the moive into my DVD player, and gasped in awe as the haunting sound of the music filled my ears. <br />Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera tells the amazing story of Christine Daae, the daughter of a swedish violinist, orphaned when her father died. She is taken in by the Opera house and trained as a chorus girl. As she rises from background singer to leading lady, Christine meets up with Raoul, her childhood sweetheart. But Christine has a dark secret. She has been taking lessons from an \\"angel of music\\" a man whose name she does not know. He tutors her, sings to her. Eventually he kidnaps her and takes her deep into his palace of darkness. He, the angel of music, more commonly known as the phantom of the opera, loves Christine. Deformed from birth, the phantom wears a mask. He is another child taken in by the opera house. But he and Christine are on opposite ends of the spectrum, she was raised with love before she came to the opera house, he with scorn, they are embodiments of light and dark. Both drawn to eachother. The Phantom loves Christine and when he takes her for a second time, Raoul persues them through the labyrinth where night is blind, and finds the Phantom. He begs for Christine's release.... and I won't tell you the rest, because I hate to spoil an ending that will bring tears to your eyes.  <br />Every aspect of this movie is spectacular! The acting, the plot, the singing. I have a new FAVORITE movie.  <br />\\"You will regret the day you did not do, all that the Phantom asked of you!!!!\\"
B0000C9ZSV|5.0|I was fifteen years old in July of 1970 when I bought a ticket to see Jimi Hendrix (and Jethro Tull, Ten Wheel Drive and others I don't remember.) at Randall's Island, a soccer stadium in the shadow of the Triboro Bridge in New York.  <br /> <br />I hadn't seen him before and was as anyone would imagine, thoroughly pschyed.  <br /> <br />But can you dig this? I had a 2AM curfew and Jimi did not show until, I was told, 4AM. I had to go home! A few weeks later he was dead. Dead! I still can't believe it. <br /> <br />Now this album comes along with the same band (Billy Cox and Mitch Mitchell)that played Randalls, a similar song set, and it is just unbelievably great. <br /> <br />I suppose I should be happy to have it, but as good as it is (A brilliant version of Foxy Lady, much better than any other in my collection; A \\"Machine Gun\\" that makes the Band of Gypsies sound like the stoned-out poseurs they certainly were, and on and on.) it cannot help but remind me of what I missed and how much I miss Jimi.  <br /> <br />But don't let my misery dissuade you from enjoying this wonderful perfomance by the greatest guitarist ever (To paraphrase the British writer Martin Amis, there are certainly other rock guitarists with greater technical skills, but none has ever played so brilliantly with so seemingly little effort.) buy it, you'll love it!
B0007TKH66|5.0|First, the disclaimer: I loved both The Original Series and The Next Generation.  (I'm still working my way to Deep Space 9 and Voyager, which I missed when on television).  Enterprise, however, is far and away my favorite.  If this show had been presented in 1966, it would probably still be in production.  \\"Enterprise\\" embodies everything I love about the Star Trek concept...space is new and largely unknown, and humankind has just really begun to master space travel.  The \\"transporter\\" is highly experimental and quirky, \\"phase cannons\\" (the precursor to phasers) are brand-new, and there are no tractor beams, just the grappler.  The Vulcans, and indeed several space-faring species, have technology significantly more advanced than that of humanity.  All of this \\"new\\" technology, and the whole concept of the show lends a unique atmosphere of wonder and freshness to the series.<br /><br />In my opinion the only reason that Enterprise did not last more than its 4 seasons is the overall decline in network television and the concept of situational series.  When The Original Series debuted in 1966 the networks dominated the weeknight entertainment market, and most American households were loyal to their favorite series.  No more.  With DVD players, TiVos, and 500 channel cable, a high budget series like Enterprise has less of a chance.  I am, at least, grateful for the 4 years that this series flourished.  Most of the storylines are excellent, and no few of them are outstanding.<br /><br />\\"Enterprise\\" has cooler weapons, uniforms, and equipment than the later Star Trek series, and the connection to the present day is still there.  Basically, \\"Enterprise\\" is set in a time about 150 years from now.  Mankind made first contact with the Vulcans (who found Earth) 90 years earlier, and this shocked and inspired humanity such that we very shortly focused on catching up with the Vulcans, and in doing so war, disease, and most other components of human backwardness were left behind.  The starship Enterprise is Earth's first deep space Warp 5 cruiser, capable of fairly quick transit between star systems.<br /><br />The cast of Enterprise is terrific.  Captain Archer, T'Pol, Trip (the chief engineer), Ensign Mayweather (helmsman), Reid (weapons officer), Dr. Phlox, and Hoshi are all very well done by the actors who play them, and in fact I think that these characters are even better done than most of the cast in later Treks.  Opinions will differ, but that's mine.<br /><br />The DVD is a great value.  It has deleted scenes, crisp video and audio, and a good interface.  The packaging is OK, in a tricorder like package that is a trifle clunky for putting on a shelf, but otherwise not bad.<br /><br />\\"Enterprise\\" embodies what I like most about the Star Trek concept: what will humans find when we venture out among the stars, and how will this affect us?

B000092ZYX|4.0|Hail to the Theif-again, Radiohead puts out music that is truely by itself. I love the Orwell references on this one. If you have a half a brain you can read between the lines of this one and see that radiohead has alot to say about the world in the state that it is currently in and of course, Thom Yorke articulates it so freakin' well. The only critizism I have of this album is that it lacks the \\"flow\\" of albums like Kid A and OK Computer. This album is very disjointed and to me just seems like a collection of songs rather than a full expression like previous effort. But none the less this album has got some great tunes. If you are just discovering Radiohead, this may be a good album to begin with
B00009ZYBY|5.0|I remember first watching this movie in the cinema, because at that time there were no other movies showing that my friends and I have not watched. What followed was an amazing cinematic experience like no other, my eyes were glued on the screen at all times and I was literally on the edge of my seat. \\"This is the story that would resonate in the years to come, the \\"Spartacus\\" and \\"Ben-Hur\\" of our time\\", I was thinking to myself...and true enough, it took home 5 Academy Awards. <br /> <br />Maximus is a grizzled war veteran in the eyes of his soldiers and the Emperor, Marcus Aurelius...but what he wants more than anything else is to go home to his wife and child and tend to his crops. After leading the Roman army to victory in one of the most breath-taking battle scenes I have seen in movie history, Marcus Aurelius summons Maximus to his camp, and asks him to take over administration of Rome until he sees fit to pass governance to the senators. Before Marcus Aurelius announces his decision, his son, a very upset Commodus kills the Emperor and takes his father's place. Commodus asks Maximus to swear loyalty to him, he doesn't and what follows is a story that is emotional, powerful and compelling at the same time. <br /> <br />Strengthening the story in every way possible is a very talented cast, led by none other than Russell \\"the Oscar\\" Crowe. It seems that every movie he does earns him an Oscar nomination and in this movie, he deservedly won the award. Casting Crowe at that time was a brilliant decision by the film's director, Ridley Scott because he was relatively unknown, so we don't see Crowe as Maximus...we just see Maximus. His portrayal of the man was exceptional, every tear, every stare, every move speaks volumes. This was a man tormented about his past, unhappy about his present and doubtful about his future. This was one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. Of course, the rest of the cast are no less impressive. Joaquin Phoenix, as Commodusgave a fine performance as someone who is evil, not because he chooses to be, but because of the way he had been raised. He has felt vulnerable and not loved his whole life. It's easy to read his mind, \\"Why do these people who hate me be treated any nicer?\\" With a supporting cast that includes Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, you expect nothing but the best, and they do deliver in spades. <br /> <br />The directing of the movie was also flawless. Ridley Scott knows what he's doing, he has a good idea what the audience is expecting and he makes the right decisions. Where other directors have tried and failed (Troy and Alexander comes to mind), Scott weaves a story that by the end of the movie, every person who is watching the movie, would want the hero to win..but will he? The anticipation that Scott evokes is what makes this movie special. The action sequences in this movie is also no walk in the park. They are shot with extreme precision, that when you watch it...every strike, every blow seems to be happening right in front of you. With a good home theater set, I am sure you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br />But ultimately, no home theater set is needed for you to really appreciate this movie, the powerful storytelling and superb acting is the driving force behind this movie and I for one, am all for that. If you have not watched this movie, I'm afraid you're missing out something special as movies like this, they come once a blue moon. Hope my review was helpful enough to spark some interest in getting this movie, you won't regret it!
0783225733|5.0|We really enjoyed this DVD... it's one of our \\"keepers\\" and definitely worth owning and viewing regularly -- it will remind you (as it has our family) that is is so very good to be born/raised/live in this country.<br /><br />It begins with a voiceover by Walter Cronkite (and yes, our announcer is the real thing!) which introduces us to the heroes as they walk across the gantry, and pays tribute to the three we lost in that disastrous fire on the launch-pad....<br /><br />The movie follows those fateful days (beginning in pre-launch) and then in orbit, and it focuses on the united effort in bringing our boys home. These men are so smart -- all of them (not just in space but at Mission Control) and is a realistic view of the times. You'll see the old Izod shirts (remember the Alligators?) and Corvettes, Mission Control (hey, they smoke -- this was not a purified/Politically Corrected re-enactment/revision of truth)... I appreciated that.<br /><br />Oh, and it's not all drama. There are moments of smiles, and it's not too intense excluding the JOYOUS moment when we hear them respond after four minutes coming through the atmosphere.... Still, I wouldn't suggest youngsters under age eight view it alone.<br /><br />[Note: our family is protective of our children and they have not been raised on a diet of broadcast television. Yours may be used to intense programming -- please use your own judgment. There is nothing bloody-gruesome in the movie, nor in the commentary. That said, you will CARE DEEPLY about all the people you see.]<br /><br />One more little (out of sequence) note: The end has Tom Hanks (who plays Jim Lovell) narrating a mini catch-up to present of the whole story. We learn what happens to the individuals in the movie. It's a wonderful \\"wrap\\" to an amazing six days in space.<br /><br />If we are going to do a docu-drama, one might also suggest that future writers/directors view this one to get an idea that they public will spend perfectly good money on QUALITY shows that are truthful, accurate and not hack-jobs. (End mini-rant!)<br /><br />I found the scenes compelling and recall the \\"lump in throat\\" of those days. To me though, seeing the families perspective broadened the effect. Oh, and Mrs. Lovell is a force to be reckoned with -- I liked her a lot! She's a classy lady.<br /><br />Minor Quibbles: In two places there are swear words (Mrs. Lovell -- who in the commentary states she doesn't \\"talk like that\\" -- when discovering the magnitude of Jim's problems swears... I thought that extraneous. Also, in another section one of the astronauts uses a bad word (appropriate maybe, but basically, unnecessary).<br /><br />The Best Stuff: After the movie we are provided with a mini-movie on how they filmed it all. NASA cooperated and many of the scenes were filmed in those planes that \\"deliberately plunge toward the earth\\" so the actors/film-makers/lighting guys et al were weightless. One of the brave actors in particular didn't want his testosterone questioned but... ;)<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the interviews... you could really see how much the whole crew wanted this to be an *excellent* movie, one to last through the ages. It's brought out that the movie will be (at some point in history) a look back on the whole era. We (the USofA) have some incredible individuals to be proud of... this is perhaps one of the best patriotic movies I have ever seen -- notwithstanding war epics. It makes me glad to be an American.<br /><br />Okay, so you also see the real gents appearing on the Johnny Carson Show too. One more thing -- at the very end of the movie you see Jim Lovell -- he's the Captain of the ship that picks up the astronaut. His wife appears once too, but don't blink! (grin)<br /><br />Also, the Bonus Materials include two voice-over commentaries. The first is made by Director Ron Howard (you know, he's good -- very good!) and tells inside things about the creation of this movie. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The bestCommentary though was done by Mr. and Mrs. Lovell -- ah, and Ron -- that con-trail isn't supposed to be there. (winks)<br /><br />All in all, this is one of our favorites... I'd go so far as to suggest you Pay Retail, and maybe even opt for First Class shipping so you won't have to wait. It is that good!.

B0006399FS|3.0|Ok, if you are a die hard u2 fan from years ago you will have noticed that u2 has definately turned a more mainstream route in the 2000s. And this album is really no different. I can understand some of us are hurt (especially us fans of Achtung Baby) by this new release. But here's the deal yo! The album is sub par...really it is and it pains me to say that. I was not a massive fan of All That You Can't Leave Behind, but in retrospect that album was a flippin' masterpiece put up next to this thing. Would I call this album a huge disapointment? Not entirely, but a distapointment none the less. <br />Ok, let's run the gammit...\\"Vertigo\\"-cool rock song, bad editing, but cool none the less- 7.5 \\"Miracle Drug\\"- Only song that really blows me away-8 \\"sometimes you can't make it on YouR own\\"- pretty cool, pretty at times, but crosses the creezy line when bono goes on about opera or something-6.5 \\"Love and Peace or Else\\"- eh...ho hum really. it's ok but just goes no where. 6 \\"city of blinding lights\\" DON'T BELIEVE THE OTHERS ABOUT THIS TRACK !!!!! It's absolutely painful to listen to! 3.5 \\"All Because of You\\"- plain old rock song that sounds half finished. 4 \\"A Man and a Woman\\"- ouch! honestly a little stupid...I think they had a good idea with this one but it goes south on the chourus\\" 5 \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\"-I really like this one, well thought out, good guitar work-7 \\"one step closer\\"-eh pretty good, but again it goes nowhere 5 \\"Original of the Species\\"- this one has some great parts in it, but overall is just lacking a bit of gusto, leaves you a bit unfulfilled. 6.5 \\"Yahweh\\"- It's really aweful to say this but it's really bad when you name the wrost song on your album after God-just a thought-2.5
B00005JMJG|5.0|It is, despite the Truman Show, still a bold move to cast Jim Carrey in any movie that doesn't require outrageous slapstick. Here, Carrey is not just required not to gurn, but to play the most anally retentive character in the film. As a concept, you would think, that would be madness. But, and with a surprising amount of ease, it works. Carrey is credible and likeable as the everyman Joel Barish. Just as Joel is believably uptight (bearish, even?), Kate Winslet's Clementine is believably flaky, and their relationship (besotted at first, but ultimately at wits' end with each other) rings very true.<br /><br />This film is not principally concerned with the memory eraser process. That is simply a device which allows the film maker to explore what would happen if two people who have grown apart really did make the proverbial fresh start without the complications of their existing history interfering. The conceptual holes that misunderstanding pedants might seek to pick are intended rather to underscore the point that this really isn't possible. The screenplay also explores the converse situation: what might happen if two people who, having just met and still in the throes of infatuation, are confronted with the reality of what life will be like down the track when, as the late Ian Curtis put it, \\"routine bites hard, and resentment rides high\\". Armed with that knowledge, would they still really give it a shot? It's a good question, and one which in real life never gets properly asked.<br /><br />Given the preponderance of \\"twist\\" movies in the last five years, I was interested to see that Kaufman deliberately defused a plot twist before it went off by presenting Joel's reconciliation with Clementine before showing their original separation. I wondered, for a while, why he did that, but I think there are two reasons. Firstly, to have the characters fall out of love, erase their memories and then miraculously meet up again as a denouement would be too cheap and manipulative - an audience of the sort Kaufman aspires to attract would see right through that and mark the film down heavily as a result. Secondly, the *fact* of their meeting up again, of itself, isn't what Kaufman is interested in: rather it is the presentation of their forgotten history once the meet-up has taken place. By giving up that fact before the commencement of play, Kaufman can disarm accusations of cheesy sentimentality.<br /><br />A large portion of the film takes place while Joel's memory is in the process of being erased. This allows Kaufman to place a (post-modern) tragic love story in the middle of a film about a couple who have already fallen out of love: Joel knows that, by his own intemperance (in commencing the erasure process in the first place), everything of his relationship (good as well as bad) will be lost as surely as if Clementine has died. As the process wears on, the more her sins pale into significance and they resemble star cross'd lovers, dashing from room to room avoiding the inevitable onset of sleep.<br /><br />There were two minor things I didn't understand. Firstly, while most of the medical characters were plot-functional, I couldn't fathom the Patrick character. I couldn't see what his point was, other than to assist Elijah Wood to de-typecast from a furry little hobbit. Query, though, whether \\"oily little creep\\" is the sort of type he really wants to be moving into. Secondly, unless I misheard, at one point Joel Barish was referred to as \\"still Mrs. Carrey's little boy\\". Was this a continuity error, or simply a playful bit of screenwriting from Mr Kaufman?<br /><br />I suspect we will never know.<br /><br />Beautifully shot and imaginatively staged, this one is definitely a keeper.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonpulative - an audience of the sort Kaufman aspires to attract would see right through that and mark the film down heavily as a result.

B000059ZLH|5.0|Individually, the members of Dream Theater are the best musicians in their field. Together ... WOW! This DVD is a must for any musician or progressive rock music fan.
B000268QB2|5.0|Being into MTV and mainstream music I am subject to many bands that can barely play their instruments, and I love it. This is perhaps the first band EVER to combine piano AND rock music. OMG that is like soooooooooooo original! I think only the guys from Coldplay can play piano better than these guys. I was talking about how fresh and original this band is until my friend's brother (a poser who's into classical garbage) said that they just use watered down, simple, repetitive harmonic progressions, and are actually extremely limited and just because they used a piano doesn't mean they were at all fresh. After I was done LOLOLing at was this moron said (I knew he was a moron because he likes Beethoven), I went \\"hey, these guys are on TV and they sell a lot of albums, so that means they're good\\".     This = good piano musak  Beethoven's Presto Agitato = crappy poser wannabee piano playing
6304806418|1.0|...and discovered it was Evita. This movie is depressing, poorly executed and lacks any redeemable qualities whatsoever. Madonna in the lead?!? What were they smoking? People....Madonna CAN'T sing! Can no one else hear her voice? If they were to have put a clip on her nose, she would be mute.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Wow....Limp Bizkit. How the mighty have fallen. Remember when \\"Nookie\\" was all you would ever hear on MTV? Now Fred Durst would probably give his left nut just to be mentioned on VH1, let alone MTV. The musical times have changed. The rap-rock genre that LB sold millions of records doing business in is over. Back then, hardcore music fans hated LB for doing what was trendy. Now LB's hated for not doing what's trendy. With the hardcore / screamo / emo movement at rock's forefront, bands like LB will soon \\"too outdated\\". And that's a bit of a shame. <br /> <br />While LB definitely aren't as talented as some of today's \\"in\\" bands like Unearth or Avenged Sevenfold, that's not to say that the guys didn't have a knack for writing amazing catchy, and sometimes even beautiful songs. While Durst's useless chants of \\"c'mon!\\" and \\"it's Limp Bizkit baby!\\" don't plague this album as much as they do Bizkit's newer releases, they're still hear and still rather silly. But look past that, and you'll find that Limp Bizkit is a bunch of young, energetic musicians, fronted by an equally young and energetic, but cocky, vocalist, and all they wanted to do was make some hard rock music. <br /> <br />Now, I just listened to this album again recently, and it was the first time in a long, long while. The track \\"Nookie\\" still pumps me up, even though I now realize how ridiculous lyrics like \\"So you can take that cookie / And stick it up your...\\", I still found the track powerful. The bass grooves, the drums are slamming, and the guitars, while not amazing, complex or really all that creative, were really catchy. Keep in  mind that Limp Bizkit was my favorite band from the Significant Other-CSATHFW era, in which I was aged 9-late 11 or early 12, before I really knew much about lyrics or music. It was just catchy pop-rock. Now it's still catchy pop-rock, but man, I really see that there's some underrated music on here. \\"Rearranged\\" is still a beautiful song, with actually decent lyrics by Durst. \\"Trust?\\" is the heaviest track here, and it will no doubt pump you up, that is if you'll allow yourself to be pumped up to a Bizkit tune. \\"No Sex\\" is a beautiful song, despite the lyrics which could ruin it, if it wasn't for the beautiful way it was sung by fellow-nu-metal has been band Staind's vocalist Aaron Lewis. <br /> <br />Listening to this album from an older point of view, I can see that Limp Bizkit were definitely deserving of the popularity they got. A talented band, that's the bottom line, who wrote really, really catchy radio-rock songs. Now that bands like My Chemical Romance and The Used are what you see when MTV actually decides to play a rock video, I really begin to miss what we used to get with LB. Where as MCR and TU all sound basically the same, nu-metal, at least at first, had variety. Really, I think LB sounds nothing like Korn, and no one really sounds like the Deftones. It really is a shame to see a band that used to be on top of the world be hard pressed to find any publicity at all for their new album (the seemingly horrible Unquestionable Truth, Pt. 1), but we do have remnants of their reign, and I, with tongue in cheek, listen to them, and enjoy them thoroughly. It was nice knowing you, Limp Bizkit.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The Phantom of The Opera is a beautifully done interpretation of the play. The character choice (Gerard Butler as the mysterious Opera Ghost and Emmy Rossum as the amazing beautifully Christine) and scene setup of the Opera take audiences away to a place where the play could only begin to touch. The musical scores redone and played by an amazing orchestra and set a haunting tone in this masterpiece. It is a definite must have for anyone who has read the book or EVER enjoyed a opera.
B000784WMW|3.0|I LOVE the VHS version of this movie and I agree that this is the best version of Jane Eyre ever made. I have been waiting for the DVD version to come out for a long time. Now having said that, I have to say I was very disappointed as I started watching it.  It is broken down to 11 episodes with beginning and ending credits on each one.  This is very distracting. Why did they not take the time to edit these out and present it as the VHS version does, as one movie.  I have many mini series in my collection and none of them has handled going from one episode to another in this manner. Keep your VHS tape of Jane Eyre and hope that they will release another DVD with these problems fixed.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Phantom is my all time favorite musical. I have only seen it on stage twice (touring companies at the Orpheum Theatre/Memphis) and it is a breathtaking, heart rending story. I felt some of the very same butterflies-in-my-stomach excitement watching this film version as I did waiting for the curtain to rise on the stage version. I am as big a Michael Crawford fan as the next guy, but I am not going to go so far as to dismiss the talent of the film Phantom. Gerard Butler did a WONDERFUL job vocally, and I thought the sexiness of this phantom added a whole new dimension to the character. I know it sounds superficial, but this phantom was HOT and with talent to boot, was a huge bonus!<br /><br />Christine was lovely and innocent and possessed all of the qualities we would expect in Christine. Her voice was smooth and confidant and while it didn't send chills like Sarah Brightman, for her age and experience she did an incredible first rate job. I really like this girl and look forward to watching her career.<br /><br />One should try to approach the viewing of this film with no expectations or preconceived notions about how it should be. I was of course hoping it would mirror the stage play and while their were some discrepancies, the film was in no way a disappointment or let-down. I think the film was true to the play and it appears to me that the director loves the original piece and kept his version as honest as possible. My kids all loved it and \\"got\\" it. They sympathized with the phantom and saw his humanity beneath his facade of not the obvious \\"mask\\" or disfigurement, but the barriers he had so carefully set around himself. A GREAT film...Thrilled it is on dvd...Destined for great things....Truly a film library classic.
B000929AJQ|1.0|i fear that i, along with most of trent's fanbase, are no longer 14. yet he still seems to be extracting lyrics from some 14 year old's diary. grow up trent. can't you write angsty songs about sex or drugs or something other than \\"poor me, nobody understands me\\". it's so tired. and the production is ridiculously pop. where are the layers? where is the noise? even \\"the fragile\\" had a few redeeming moments. this is just fluff. maybe somebody needs to pull some of trent's teeth out. then he'd have something to whine about. i can't believe i bought this the day it came out. my friends all made fun of me, but i had faith! i thought trent would come out on top: older, wiser, maybe with some better lyrics or some ferocious chip on his shoulder. but no. just some whiny s**t. and the ABSOLUTE WORST SINGLE OF THE YEAR (the hand that feeds)! a huge disappointment. seriously, avoid it. stick with broken and downward spiral, or even pretty hate machine (for the cheese factor.)

0671027387|3.0|First off, let me say that I am a Dan Brown fan.  He explores his subject indepth.  While many writers get away with giving out some knowledge and then getting right to the point, Brown explores his subject and then immerses you in that subject.  Deception Point lives up to that ideal.  By the end of the book, you will feel like you truly understand glaciers and meteors.<br /><br />I enjoyed the read.  The first few pages were spectacular and shocking.  The material presented gave me more than enough information in understanding the science of the meteorite.  I felt I understood the subject.  With that said, it often became too bogged down in giving very detailed details.<br /><br />In the book, I found the reasoning for the President's asking of Rachel Sexon to deliver an important message to his staff was unncecessary and rather silly.  The message could have been and should have been delivered in a much easier way than the President had it done and not have it delivered by Rachel.  I would think that one of the well-known scientists could have easily delivered the message, made it easy and would have been readily accepted.  But, it furthered the plot for Brown and I thought that was an easy way to get it out.<br /><br />I also found the plot to be revealed between Rachel and the two scientists as not very believable.  You had an intelligence person basically explain to the scientists how things are explained in the science arena where they are the true experts, not her.  Yes, Brown did have the scientists make their points but it was continually Rachel explaining to them how it was not only possible but probable in parts of the different analysis and in ways that the scientists had not thought of.<br /><br />There is a significant plot twist in the book toward the end and that was appreciated and was interesting.  But, the book became too bogged down by unnecessary details and a plot that stretched at the realms of being believable.  In ranking Brown's books, I would list it as: Angels and Demons, DaVinci Code, Digital Fortress and then finally Deception Code.  That is why it received only 3 stars.s books, I would list it as: Angels and Demons, DaVinci Code, Digital Fortress and then finally Deception Code.  That is why it received only 3 stars.
B00004XONN|5.0|The first time I heard it i was like \\"what the hell....where's all the guitars???\\" I really hated it when it came out. Divine Intervention caused me to listen to it again, and now i LOVE it. See, what's so great about this album is that the experimentation just blends beautifully with their music. Sure, a lot of bands have done it... but just take one listen to U2's Discotheque and realise that Radiohead is the one of the few band that truelly mastered this. And I LOVE IT, How can you say that OK Computer is their best album??? It's not, Kid A and Amnesiac are!!! <br /> <br />Oh and THOSE ORGAN OPENING NOTES on \\"Everything is in its right place\\", ISNT IT THE MOST HAUNTING YOU'VE EVER HEARD????
B0000CDLA7|1.0|these two ruin the album- lack of rudess hurts- lacj of prog hurts
B0008ISM40|5.0|its the feeling you get. <br />First of all I want to say that my review could be bias, seeing them live with teeth in chicago was outrageous even before I heard the new album. However, after talking to many people who've heard \\"the hand that feeds\\" on the radio, there are people who love it and people who hate it (some of which used to be part time nin fans). If you know anything about trent or from what mindset he comes from you can almost feel what he's screaming about. I've listened to the new album about 30 times now. I do agree that its a lot like the fragile with a little more of a sharp edge. I can also see the reflective pool he was looking into for inspiration. Touches of old lyrics and sounds mixed with fresh dust. Again Reznor spoils anyone who can appreciate true song writing with a masterpiece that will sit beside me in time.

0767827902|5.0|Without a doubt, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is a remarkably beautiful film by any standard.  In fact, it is hard to know where to begin.  As far as the story is concerned, Director Peter Bogdanovich has done a superlative job of rendering the passion and emotion of Larry McMurty's novel onto the big screen.  During the film, the audience becomes immersed in the depressing, claustrophobic atmosphere of a small town in Texas during the early 1950s.  But this is no \\"typical\\" rendition of the conservative 1950s.  Instead, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW decides to handle the sexual politics of the 1950s with a tight-grip on reality, granting us a rather different discussion of sex during this time period than we are accustomed to receiving.  This is a town of broken-dreams, awkward love affairs, and convenient marriages.  It is a town where women are forced to marry in order to provide for themselves, only to end up in need of love and hating themselves.  It is a town of individuals watching life passing them by, wishing they could have lived, and refusing to start now.  Finally, it is a town that I think, like it or not, expresses a deep concern for many of us.<br /><br />Shooting the film in black & white was a great decision and helps transport THE LAST PICTURE SHOW into a different time (1951, to be exact).  There is no excess in this film.  The opening shot, of a dusty town in Texas, is beautifully captured without any gimics and the film holds true to form until the ending shot echoes the same bleak view of the town.  The acting is terrific and it is particularly fun to see the likes of Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd when they were extremely young.<br /><br />With its frank depictions of sex and the loss of innocence, THE LAST PICTURE SHOW manages to touch audiences on a very personal note.  Few films can communicate the claustrophobia of life, particularly of life in a small town, and this film succeeds marvelously.  While watching it, I kept thinking of WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, another fine film with a similar feel.  Both, in fact, include a young man living in a small town who gets involved with a married woman in a loveless affair.  Both boys take care of younger boys who are mentally handicapped and they are both tales of someone fighting a life that is passing by at an alarming rate.  You will be affected by this film, for better or for worse.  It is one of the best films I have seen in a long time and I would highly recommend it to anyone.GILBERT GRAPE, another fine film with a similar feel.

0385510438|4.0|In \\"The Last Juror\\" Grisham returns to Clanton Mississippi, the setting for \\"A Time To Kill.\\" When a young widdow is brutally raped and murdered, she names her assailant with her last dying breath: Danny Padgitt, a son of the dangerous and powerful crime family that seems to own Clanton. Willie Traynor, the young reporter who buys the local newspaper when it falls into bankrupcy, covers the case in the paper and befriends Miss Callie, the matriarch of the amazing Ruffin family and the first black woman juror in Ford County. Danny is tried and found guilty, but he receives life imprisonment instead of the death penalty. When he is released on parole after only nine years and returns to Clanton, the jurors who convicted him begin to die one by one, and the remaining jurors fear for their lives.  <br />This novel features not only the setting of Grisham's earliest novel, but also the reappearance of its lawyers Lucien Wilbanks and Harry Rex Vonner. It covers some of the same issues of race and criminal justice. But if you are expecting this story to be similar to its predecessor, you might be disappointed. For one thing, the protagonist here is Willie Traynor rather than a lawyer. The story does contain some tense courtroom drama, but that comprises only part of the novel. Instead we see the gentler and softer-hearted Grisham as represented in some of his latest works such as \\"Bleachers\\" and \\"Skipping Christmas.\\" After the fast-paced trial and while Danny is in prison, the story changes direction to indulge in some good old-fashioned Southern storytelling. <br /> <br />Through the voice of newspaper owner Traynor, a northerner who views the town with the eyes of an outsider but who comes to care for its inhabitants, Grisham shows his affection for Southern small town life in which he grew up in. The story has some humor and folk wisdom sperradically appear when you wouldn't expect any humor at all.  This style of writing is the reason I love to read Grisham's novels. The ending is really sad, but satisfying. I strongly recommend this novel for readers who appreciate both the old and newer type styles of writing in which Grisham is famous for! <br />

0596009208|4.0|Not only does this book give a beginner a comprehensive tutorial in Java, it also highlights Object Oriented Concepts that are essential to good Java programming.  I would have given this book a five star rating, if it wasn't for bad editing (errors in examples, etc.)  But, at least, there are less errors than the first edition.  This is the first book on learning Java that I have been able to actually sit down and make my way through.  Rather than use the basic Java compiler, I would recommend using the Eclipse product (download free at [...]) since that is the new emerging standard in Java (and other lanugages) programming.  Learning Eclipse while you are learning Java would only help.
1400043662|4.0|Enjoyable, but not his best work, either. Still, I am a diehard Murakami fan. I've read all of his novels and enjoyed them. This just doesn't rank with \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland,\\" \\"A Wild Sheep Chase,\\" or \\"The Wind-up Bird Chronicles.\\" Still, it was a fun read. Most enjoyable characters: Mr. Nakata and Mr. Hoshino. Both characters were a lot of fun. I particularly enjoyed Mr. Nakata's conversations with the cats. In the end, it was a light, enjoyable breeze of a read, and not nearly so haunting as, \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland,\\" or \\"Wind-up Bird Chronicles.\\"
B00003OSSL|3.0|Director Sydney Pollack and screenwriter Kurt Luedke (sp) collaborated on the Oscar winning epic OUT OF AFRICA, which I found to be rather dull and uninspiring.  They re-united for this romantic drama focusing on Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas.  He's a maverick cop; she's running for Congress.  Seems that their spouses were having an affair and they are both victims of a plane crash.  The movie focuses on Ford's inability to accept the affair, while Thomas wants to move on with her life.  They fall in love, sort of, and the rest of the movie is how they deal with this.  A subplot involving dirty cops seems to serve no real purpose, but it does give Charles Dutton and Dennis Haysbert some choice scenes.  Dave Grusin's haunting score helps the movie and there is some beautiful shots of a snowy DC, but ultimately the movie's merely a showcase for the stars' performances, which are good considering the material they've been given.

B000002B7U|5.0|I've read and heard a lot of criticism about the new Ozzy image also I've seen the \\"reality shows\\" as The Osbournes and Battle for Ozzfest, and I think something: Has or hasn't Ozzy all the credits (and the reason) to do it? Of course YES, because he's the real METAL GODFATHER and thanks to him (and the Sabbath mates) all the actual Metallica, Manson, Slipnot, Linkin Park, System of a Doom, etc. etc. etc. \\"nu-metal\\" fans can enjoy them for the deep influence of Ozzy in their lives, and Ozzy can do all he wants.<br /><br />But this is only the prologue, coming back at the 80's Ozzy blew up the Black Sabbath image and began his solo career (so much successful thanks to his lovely wife Sharon, his new-life manager) and despite the great recordings of \\"Diary of a Madman\\" and \\"Blizzard of Oz\\", in which Randy Rhoads demonstrates in life was one of the greatest metal-classic players of the decade, the Ozzman need to change that \\"trademark\\" musical icon and choose hiring Jake E. Lee, Phil Souzan and Randy Castillo for the \\"Ultimate Sin\\" (with all my respects, for the \\"Bark at the Moon\\" album, the main song would be included in the \\"Sin\\" album to be absolutely the PERFECT 80's Ozzman recording) Ozzy gives a new image and 180 degrees change for the antique iconed shape.<br /><br />All the album puts originality for itself, maybe Ozzy doesn't sound as like a \\"powerful\\" metal singer, but his voice is un-alikeable, the cover is too \\"hellish\\" in fact Ozzy looks like a gargoyle and the gal this his gorgeous hips on doesn't looks like Sharon, but are they making an ultimate sin? Sinners are at all the marketing people makes that image, the music is another theme,\\"Ultimate Sin\\", \\"Secret Loser\\", \\"Never Know Why\\", \\"Never\\", \\"Thank God for the Bomb\\", \\"Fool Like You\\", \\"Shot in the Dark\\", Lightning Strikes\\" sounds fantastic, but the most amazing stuff is the guitar riffs, not like Randy or Tony (Iommi) for our tranquility 'cause we don't want any kind of copies, Jake is great and rocks a lot, much arpeggios, tappings, lickins, and faster solos can be appreciate specially in the incredible \\"Killer of Giants\\" track, that is an epic song and so much deepest in the Ozzy career (he must no hate this album, what \\"f****n'\\" happen Ozzy???)<br /><br />And I think Ron Nevison made a very decent production for the album, this is very different to the another Ozzy albums, that is the reason I love Ultimate Sin, who becomes to be THE ULTIMATE 80'S METAL ALBUM!!!!! Thanks Ozz for this gift, since I was a 19 years old kid in that age, I enjoy this stuff.s a lot, much arpeggios, tappings, lickins, and faster solos can be appreciate specially in the incredible \\"Killer of Giants\\" track, that is an epic song and so much deepest in the Ozzy career (he must no hate this album, what \\"f****n'\\" happen Ozzy???) <br /> <br />And I think Ron Nevison made a very decent production for the album, this is very different to the another Ozzy albums, that is the reason I love Ultimate Sin, who becomes to be THE ULTIMATE 80'S METAL ALBUM!!!!!

B000002GVO|5.0|I worship this album.  It is the Eagles' masterpiece.  A couple of points could be made, however.  It is dominated by Don Henley, vocally and lyrically, and set the pattern for the rest of his career, where he does 'preachy' songs with (sometimes) decent melodies.  He's been trying to rewrite the title track, Wasted Time and The Last Resort, and to a lesser extent, Life In The Fast Lane and Victim Of Love, ever since, and he sounds more tired and more mannered with each solo album.  Here he hit a creative peak which he will never reach again.<br /><br />Glenn Frey only sings one song, which is absurd.  However we are fortunate that that song happens to be the heartbreaking New Kid In Town.  This is the album writ small - the history of California in one man's career and doomed love life.  The magnificent harmonies, guitar work and Frey's beautiful lead singing make it the album's quiet highlight.<br /><br />The other non-Henley tracks, Joe Walsh's striking ballad Pretty Maids All In A Row ('why do we give up our hearts to the past'?) and Randy Meisner's apparently upbeat yet achingly bittersweet Try And Love Again complete a mesmeric, totally compelling evocation of California in the 1970s.
B000067J24|4.0|I have hesitated on seeing this movie, because I haven't really been impressed by Penelope's work, even though I have seen her previously in All About My Mother, Open Your Eyes, and Vanilla Sky. Finally, this movie made me take her more seriously as a good actress with more than just beauty, and that she's no longer trying to increase her fame by dating high-profile actors. She's actually very pleasing and enjoyable to watch in this romantic comedy about love, cheating, cooking, new life/career and reconcilation.<br /><br />Isabella(Penelope Cruz) is married to Toninho(Murilo Benicio), a musician/restaurant owner in a small town in Northern Brazil. She's the best chef and her cooking attracts a ton of business for the restaurant, and even job offers from America. One problem occurs when her \\"on top\\" sexual position made her dissatisfied husband to cheat on her, she decides to take off and headed for San Francesico for a new life.<br /><br />She reunited with her long time friend Monica(Harold Perrinear,Jr.), a fierce and funny drag queen and just got out of jail. She had to use some kind of black magic ritual in order to eliminate all her love for her ex-husband so that she could move on. She took a job as a cooking teacher, and one day she encountered a TV show producer named Cliff(Mark Feuodtein) who was looking for a host for a new cooking show, and she got the job. Her style, sophiscation, and sex appeal instantly turned the show into a sensation. Just when she thought she could give love a try again when Cliff pursued her, her ex arrived at the scene and accidently became involved as background performer in the show. Now she's confused about her position in life.....<br /><br />Harold Perrineau, Jr. did a great job as Monica, and he also did narration for this film. He is quite a comic relief. At first, I thought his role could have been played Rupaul, but then a less famous actor is probably more appropiate.<br /><br />This is a good date movie or chick flick even, and I think it's so far the best Penelope Cruz film to be seen by non-Spanish audiences.hick flick even, and I think it's so far the best Penelope Cruz film to be seen by non-Spanish audiences.

B000002C25|5.0|I'd have to say this may be one of my personal favourite Oasis albums...  I know a lot of people were a little down on this particular album... and a lot of people are more into the more pop hits such as Wonderwall (which is fair)...  But personally I am moved to no end by such songs as 'Don't go away' -- I feel there is just so much raw emotion captured in 'Be Here Now' it can't be ignored... or brushed off as an inferior album...  Because in my personal opinion - Noel Gallagher is a musical genius... and this album is very clever - perhaps more so than Morning Glory -- because this is the album he really let himself go in... also it's full of emotions that are both intense and admirable...  The music is very unique...  I haven't heard anything like it --- It truly is it's own style and I believe it really captured something amazing... which is the essence of Oasis I believe...  I'm really disappointed in those that can't see the mastery in this album...
B0007GAERG|3.0|well it's far from her best, but a vast improvement on her last few albums. For me, mariah will always be a fav of mine, coz of songs like one sweet day, hero and always be my baby etc.. <br />This album is pretty good, and i recommend it to all rnb fanz. Mariah is definately improving since glitter so i hope the trend continues and i look forward to the next one. Well done Mimi!
B000002AS3|5.0|Before this album... music was seeming stale and without any kind of meaning -- music was going downhill since the musical revolution of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones...  Then came Oasis... and it inspired a generation... and I know I'm not exaggerating... and it's a scary wonderful thing... <br /> <br />Their albums were all amazing... though this one holds a special place being the first...  It was like the shy yet bold step out from behind the curtain...  and when gazing upon this new wonder... many grabbed hold... some were scared of it... but only one thing is certain --- the music is amazing... and no one has ever been able to say a thing negative about the music which is true...
B000089RV6|4.0|Everyone knows the story behind this album, it's been reviewed about a million or so times: how Bon's passing away almost put an end to the band and how Brian Johnson came in and they recorded this masterpiece. And everyone knows all of the songs here as well, BACK IN BLACK, YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG, HELLS BELLS, SHOOT TO THRILL, ROCK N ROLL AIN'T NOISE POLLUTION, ect. Just turn on your radio and tune into any rock station in the afternoon on any given day and you will hear one of these songs playing. This is one of the greatest albums ever committed to wax, that is a given, it is also one of the most overplayed as well. I am a big fan of AC/DC, but they have 16 other albums besides BACK IN BLACK, WTF? why can't we hear lost classics like \\"Guns for Hire\\", \\"Down Payment Blues\\" or even the ocasional \\"High Voltage\\" instead of playing YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG for the 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000th time? You can <br />hear these songs being played anywhere: weddings,sporting events,TV commercials, hell, even 6th grade graduations for christ sake. It is funny how BACK IN BLACK is the least played CD in my AC/DC collection, it's becuase its just so effing overplayed that it ruins it. <br /> <br />Yeah, it's great, but they really need to calm down with it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Never mind that I saw the film in the theater over 30 times, the moment this film came on my  in-home TV screen, the chills were back. The film will go down as one of the greatest love story epics of all time, a watch-over-and-over-again film that transends the ages.<br /><br />The additional DVD was a delight. Our entire family enjoyed the behind the scenes, only wishing Joel and company had added three for four discs, as we can't get enough of the magic of the Phantom!<br /><br />A must have for Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum fans, as the two of them ignite the screen with all that is wonderful about the Phantom and Christine.
B00000IMTH|5.0|I though that this was their best album. I don't know what it is, but this was just perfectly put togeather and is an all time classic from this band. I did like the debut, but it was a little too much like ELF, ronnies old band which was essentialy a honk tonk blues band. Rising has the heavyweight STARGAZER and LIGHT IN THE BLACK, but the rest of the cuts are kind of weak. LLRNR has no weak cuts however, and this would be the last Rainbow album that Dio would record with. It kind of reminds me of Led Zepplin in a lot of ways, songs like LADY OF THE LAKE and GATES OF BABALON have that Jimmy Page-esqe magic to them which i like alot. I can tell you how good this album really is! i rarely give out 5 stars, but this deserves such an accolade! I think that this is prehaps Dio's best performance, ever, or at least tied with HEAVEN AND HELL, which came out 2 years after this.The change to the band was the addition of Bob Daisley on bass and David Stone on keyboards, who would only serve one term with Rainbow, that being this album. It is true that these guys basically pioneered gothic flavored medival styled metal, and the band would have a substantial influence on powermetal/eurometal/fantasy bands like Malmsteen, Helloween and even Dio's future solo band, DIO. So in a way, Ritchie Blackmore, along with Uli Jon Roth, is almost like the father to all eurometal.  <br /> <br />LONG LIVE ROCK N ROLL 10/10 <br />LADY OF THE LAKE 10/10 <br />L.A. CONNECTION 8/10 <br />GATES OF BABALON 9/10 <br />KILL THE KING 10/10 <br />THE SHED (SUBSTLE) 8/10 <br />SENSITIVE TO LIGHT 8/10 <br />RAINBOW EYES 10/10 <br /> <br />
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies has been my all time favorite movie since I saw it when it first aired on t.v. <br /> <br />It is a magical movie about a group of friends who are about to lose their houses to make way for a golf course. They find a map linked to a pirate legend and are on their way to an amazing journey. They discover the meaning of true friends (and some pirates and treasure too!) <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie to anyone, regardless if you are a kid or an adult. This movie rocks!
B000062YAZ|3.0|Slayer's Reign in Blood (1986) <br />Considered the greatest thrash album of all time by many, it is definatly one of the most infamous records ever relesed and to this day it is still revered as a major influence to heavy metal music. <br /> <br />OK, i am going to be fair here, i never really thought that much of Slayer. Reing in Blood is often considered THE thrash album of all time, and i can see the logic behind that argument. I don't really like this, but i am still giving it it's props becuase of the influence it had on many bands, and to play at these speeds does require talent. Personally, i think the greatest thrash album ever is DarkAngle's \\"Darkness Decends\\", which boasts considerable greater depth in songwritting and arangment then this, but that is another argument all togeather. First of all, even though this is metal, and it is meant to be brutal, i had a tough time with the lyrics. I thought alot of the lyrics were pretty tastleless and downright miserable, i know that this kind of music deals with violence,death,satan ect, but they are for the most part largly fictional in most cases, but not here. Some of the things in here hit a little too close to home in terms of reality, mainly in the first song, Angle of Death, which was an actual horrible event before it was this \\"cool metal song\\". After that, they pretty much go into cartoon satanism and over the top violence which is typical of the gendre. The lyrics are pretty bad, but if the music is good, that can easily be outweighted. Musicaly, this is a little confusing but great once you get it, for one thing, this might be the greatest shred album i'v ever heard. The soloing by King and Hannemen is beyond belife, they don't resemble traditional guitar solos, they are kind of chaotic and all over the place, which is kind of a style all on to their own. The bass is pretty much inaudible, what is the point of Tom even playing bass for these guys if it can't be heard? Toms singing fits the music very well, he really doesn't sing, his style is more like shouting and yelling, kind of like early James Hetfeild. The druming is PHENOMINAL! Lombardo has got to be one of the greatest drummers ever, and this album is proof. Overall, i think it is good if you are into this type of music, and i think that they had something really going here, but i can see it's bad points as well as it's good. There seems to be a trend on this page, there are many reviews saying that this is flawless and unbeatable (which it is not), and others totally bashing it (not giving it the credit it deserves). I tend to stand in the middle of the road of this argument, i can see it's shortcomings, but also can see its strong points.I give this album credit for helping start death metal as well, even though it wasn't the first album to do it (Possessed released SEVEN CHURCHES in 1985, a full year befor this, which was almost like the first death metal album), it still had a major influence on bands like Death,Decide and Obiturary.I think it is kind of ludacris to be calling this thing the greatest metal album ever or whatever title some biased fan gives it, because it is not. I will admit it is good in some respects but i really think it is average overall, it just didn't move me. The songs seem kind of forced and not very well put to gether, depite the musical talent here. After listeing to it, i feel kind of unfufilled, most songs here are under 2 to 4 minutes which equals out to under a half hour at 10 songs, not much bang for your buck.  <br /> <br />If you want to get into Slayer, you might as well pick this up because it is regarded as the definative Slayer album. But don't expect this to be that great, it is mostly hyped. I would recomend a much superior \\"Master of Puppets\\" over this, for that is much more worth while of you ears and listening pleasure.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is pure artistry. Anyone who says that he can't rhyme is an idiot who doesn't know anything about hip hop, or just a straight hater. The man is a pioneer, a true ground breaker, and in my opinion, the best producer of our time, with the exception of Dre. So back up off my man, cuz if ya hate him, you ain't in the right place to be speaking any kind of truth. This man is LEGEND.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The classic love triangle: woman torn between two men.  Will she choose normalcy and safety or danger and the exotic?   Classic themes: love, obsession, and sacrifice. <br /> <br />The actors did fantastic jobs.  Emmy Rossum as Christine conveys fear, fascination, love, and pity with subtle expressions--just how her eyes change; she does not overact.  Gerard Butler as the Phantom projects love, obsession, rage, pain, and Machiavellian intent with his eyes and voice.  Patrick Wilson does a great job of being the normal, handsome hero figure. All of the other actors were exceptional. <br /> <br />Even if the leads' voices don't match the technical quality of the original stage performers, they are better actors which justifies why they were cast in their parts.  Since the silver screen shows minute detail, their acting abilities shine. Watching PONR, you can see the fear and fascination Christine has for the Phantom, and you can see the love and obsession that the Phantom has for Christine, not just through their faces/gestures, but through their singing.   <br /> <br />This is a gut-wrenching tale.  You would have to be made of stone to be unaffected by this movie; how could you not feel sympathy for the Phantom? <br /> <br />Sure, as a Phantom fan, I question some directorial decisions, but regardless, this is a fabulous, high quality movie that deserves appreciation and not the snobbish disdain it received from so many \\"professional\\" critics who seemed to have axes to grind agains ALW or JS. <br /> <br />Go out and buy this movie!  You will not be disappointed.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|Its the prototypical 80's action flick.  I saw it lots of times in the theatre when I was 10 in 1986.  I love this movie. <br /> <br />This edition is far richer in features than the original DVD release, which had none.  The video, however, is still not cleaned up, its the same grainy stuff in the first release.  The sound is excellent, however.  And the special features are interesting, with all of the cast interviews and the survival training featurette.  All to the good. <br /> <br />The problems start with the commentary track.  Military advisors, writers, and Tony Scott.  Far too crowded.  They should have had separate commentary tracks for the advisors, director, and writers.  Audio tracks don't take up much disc space.  The special edition of Platoon does this perfectly. <br />  <br />But the most annoying part of this edition, is that during the commentary, Tony Scott talks about deleted scenes and the other filmed endings constantly.  Where the heck are they on the DVD? <br />  <br />I think they're going to release another special edition for the 20th anniversary in 2006 when it (allegedly) gets re-released to theatres.  If you have the original Top Gun DVD, don't bother with this one.  It tries, but they held a lot potenailly interesting extras back for a twenty year old movie.

I got lone cd of his rock and roll which i copied from the libary and i like it, it sounds like jeff buckley. This cd is a good one i listen to it in it entirely on his website. It also is pretty good for a double and the price is not bad. It sounds like a better version of that new bright eyes cd but ryan has a better voice and his music is better. This cd is a must for any fans of bands like Wilco and other alt-country music.
B000002GVO|1.0|Both The Eagles & Michael Jackson are rubbish and neither are the best. That honour belongs to the one and only Starland Vocal Band.

B00005JKG9|5.0|\\"The man from downtown\\" comes and informs the sales staff \\"we're adding something special to this month's sales promotion.  First prize, a cadillac convertable.  Second prize is a set of steak knives.  Third prize is you're fired!  <br />The pressure is on--how far would _you_ go to preserve your job? <br /> <br />This movie is based on a play which is a riviting, penetrating study of the Male psychie as expressed in the workplace.  Men are front and center--they are working, drinking, schmoozing--and selling.   The part women figure in this play only by the impact they have on the men--the sick daughter, the wife who answered the wrong sales ad.   Your manhood is directly proportional to your sales volume, so A.B.C. --  Always Be Closing! <br /> <br />How ironic then is the line Al Pacino delivers towards the end of the movie: \\"We're not living in a world of men.  We're living in a world of clock-watchers and office holders.\\"  <br /> <br />This is one of those movies you can watch over and over, savoring the dialog and marveling over the excellent performances.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Then there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with you. This is one of my favorite PMG recordings, and that saying a lot being that I own dam near very PMG album. What makes this album even better is that I saw PMG perform the album live at The Beacon Theater here in NYC. The album is invigorating in it's fast paced be-bop sections of the pieces, and subtle but yet beautiful in its quieter sections of the pieces. To see someone perform a 68 minute live set contiguously is utterly amazing and I dont know any other composer/producer/musician in music that could do it as flawless as PMG.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Well, I have listened to disk 1 over and over and I just think it is OK at best.  However, disk 2 more than redeems this album...it's one of those that you can start in your player and listen all the way through, and if you get to the end and it starts over, so be it.  I'm a big RA fan and I think that the 2nd disk is right up there with Heartbreaker, of course I may like that one the best because it was my intro to his music.  I give it 5 stars based on the strength of the 2nd, if I could rate separately it would be 3 stars for #1 and 6 stars for #2.

It makes you think wow I waited almost six years for this?  The first song all the love in the world is half a good song, the second half is good the first half is like what was that crap?  Another one beside you in time, once again the second half of that song is good, the first half was like what is this crap.  Do yourself a favor and listen to this before you buy it or simply buy the hand that feeds single with the remixes which are good.  This is only the second time ever one of my favorite bands who has never come out with crap music, finally put out crap music.  The first was fear factory with their latest album archetype.
B000929AJQ|3.0|If this had come out fifteen years ago, it would be earthshaking, but things change, and Trent hasn't.  You can't just continue to beat the same drum.<br /><br />Ah well, it's not like very many artists have managed it, most plow some new ground and then just go back over it again and again until they're on the retro circuit.  Coming up with really new music is the hardest thing on earth.  Name a group, aside from a bizarre fluke like the Bee Gees, that started off on top and came back to stand there again?  Doesn't happen.
B000268QB2|5.0|Although some have likened this band to Coldplay (whom I love), Keane has a unique sound all their own. It is easy to dismiss them  as just another \\"cut from the same mold\\" Brit band, but to the trained ear, this album will grow on you.  At first listen, the first three songs sound too similar, however songs like \\"Sunshine\\" and \\"Bedshaped\\" seem to give the album a redeeming quality. Even though I gave this album a high rating, it still does't compare to Coldplay's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" but it is worth having in your collection.
B0002S94OS|4.0|\\"Ashes of the Wake\\" is a good CD, but not nearly as good as LoG's previous releases. As most people already know, the production on those 2 older CDs was not that great, but even with that problem they were both 5 star albums.  With a new record label and the addition of a new producer, the sound quality has improved greatly, which is definately a plus.  However, the songs themselves don't seem to have the same edge as before. The best songs are \\"Laid to Rest\\" and \\"Now You've Got Something To Die For\\", but most of the songs are good.
068484267X|4.0|One may look back on their childhood to remember the once joyful and free-spirited moments of life. This is not, however, true in Frank McCourt's case. When reviewing his childhood, all that comes to mind is devastation, death and poverty that followed the lives of so many families in the time period. Through his autobiography, Angela's Ashes, McCourt depicts the depressing Irish Catholic childhood he woke up to face each morning.  <br />Born in New York in the 1930's into the house of a miserable cigarette-addicted mother, Angela, and an alcoholic father, Malachy, who spends most of the money he earns on buying pints at the local bar, Frank McCourt is immediately given much to deal with. Being the oldest of seven children in his family, Frank has much more responsibility then the average child today has ever experienced. Frank's father figure returns home each night completely drunk singing songs of Irish patriotism while abusing and shouting at his family, providing no example for his sons to look up to. His father's behavior changes for a brief period of time when Frank's mother gives birth to a young girl, Margaret. His father stops drinking and begins working for the good of the family, however, it isn't long before this \\"tiny angel\\" passes away, destroying all hope of the family's success. Never again would Frank's father show such devotion to saving his family. The devastating loss of their only daughter made if unbearable for the family to stay in America with complete memory of the child. The McCourts move to Ireland, which Frank later admits was the worst decision they could have made at that time.  <br />Reaching Ireland with not a cent, the McCourts first find shelter with their father's relatives then their mother's siblings until finally they could settle under a roof of their own in Limerick. Frank and his brother, Malachy, are sent to a strict Catholic school while his father finds a job to support the family. Their conditions, however, do not improve and it is not long before their father looses his job and two of Frank's youngest brothers become ill and pass away. There seems to be no hope of a better future for the McCourts in these new surroundings. The family is soon forced to beg neighbors and churches near by for food or money. They grow weak and desperate with what seems to be a slim chance of survival. Numerous nights consist of Frank's drunken father returning home to his silent mother smoking and starring blankly into the ash filled fire place, eyes full or tears. So many nights the McCourts spend freezing in their beds with not a single flame in the fire place or a hot scrap of food on the table. One night, the McCourt's result to picking up scraps of wood along the River Shannon. \\"She says that's what she missed most of all in America, the River Shannon. The Hudson was lovely but the Shannon sings. I can't hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy. Mam tells us gather anything that burns along the Dock Road; coal, wood, cardboard, paper. She says, There are them that burn the horse droppings but we're not gone that low yet\\" (69). To me, McCourt's writing comes off as a intriguing style that I have never seen before. McCourt is able to depict such a compelling story of his miserable childhood so vividly that it makes one feel very sympathetic while reading. The conditions he lived under are unimaginable, and it is extraordinary he survived such a challenging youth.  <br />The book concludes with Frank's father finally deciding to move to England and work in the factories to make money that will support his family. As usual, he is not always faithful to his words, and most weeks spends the money on alcohol. As a result, the McCourts can no longer pay their rent and are forced out of their home and move in with their mother's relative. At the age of fifteen, Frank longs to be independent and takes off to become a self-responsible man, finding a job as s mailman in the local post office. It is at this time that he realizes he has had enough of the desperate life in Ireland and decides to save each bit of many he earns to buy a ticket to America, the land of hope and dreams.  <br />Angela's ashes represent the ashes which fall from her cigarettes and the ash-filled fire place Angela stars at so blankly each day. As she revolves so many of her days around these ashes, the book begins to obtain an ashy feel of its own. It is a dark, lifeless and sunless feel that coats the novel. The ashes represent Angela's crumbled dreams of raising a healthy family with a supportive responsible father. Instead, Angela is left with cigarettes for comfort and the warmth of smoldered ashes in the fireplace. Angela's Ashes not only opened my eyes to the true extent of misery one's childhood can possess but also showed me how unexpected life can be when under the most deprived of situations a family is able to survive.  <br />
B0002OERI0|1.0|When the lord Jesus cracked open his latest punk rock creation and Green Day spewed forth like the primordial ooze, a great band of pure rock genius was born.  Actually, the cute Billie Joe and the boys are the greatest punk band ever from a third world nation.  Hailing from a little mountain village in Mongolian China known for its genuinely intelligent underground punk rock scene, Green Day broke out back in 1975 with such poignant and throught provoking numbers as \\"Hitchin a Ride\\", \\"Welcome to Paradise\\", and the amazing \\"Geek Stink Breath\\".  With this history, it is no wonder that this band has risen to rock's upper echelons of critical acclaim.  Not convinced? Well at your next social get-together, put a spin on \\"When I Come Around\\" and I promise you this ... most, if not all, of your friends will join in with that tearful chorus.  A rock anthem for the ages...  <br /> <br />With \\"American Idiot\\", Green Day have established themselves as top dogs with timely, intelligent lyrics.  A concept album that clearly tops such lackluster efforts as Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", \\"American Idiot\\" is probably the single greatest piece of musical composition since Mozart's unfinished \\"Requiem\\".  And if the great punk masters Green Day had started \\"Requiem\\", you know they WOULD have finished it ... and called it \\"Dookie\\".   <br /> <br />Green Day, don't you ever change.  With all of the violence and turmoil in the world today, your brainy rock opera is the only thing that can make us feel safe.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|File under so stupid it might be funny.  The only redeeming part of this movie is that it is short.  Also, keep watching after the credits, Lafawnda and Ted get married.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon is something of a living legend. He's got a career that makes a lot of people envious, including me. He gets to create compelling worlds inhabited by characters we care about, and he gets to do it on his terms (relatively speaking). On top of that, he's very gifted storyteller, and he keeps getting better.<br /><br />Firefly is the culmination of all of the knowledge, tricks, experience, and skill that he's learned in his career at that point, and it really shows. Firefly has an impeccable ensemble cast, tight writing and directing, and a very creative premise. The chemistry and dynamics between the ensemble cast is what makes Firefly shine. The kind of magic Firefly radiates transcends its science-fiction roots, and secures a place in the history of television as one of the finest TV shows ever created. It's not a surprise that such a fine show got canceled so quickly; we've seen this kind of thing happen before (remember My So-Called Life?). Idiotic shows that appeal to the lowest common denominator stay on the air for years, while a masterpiece like Firefly gets canceled before reaching the end of one season. But as we all know already, there is no justice in this world.
B00000099Y|5.0|This record is very important, and should be listened to by all who appreciate art.  Too bad that the very thing most of us appreciate about it (it takes SEVERAL listens to sink in) is probably the reason it doesn't get more widespread acceptance.  Oh well, I consider myself lucky to have found this record and Tool's other work. <br /> <br />Simply put:  Sure, you can bang your head to Aenima, but sit back and listen!  Take it all in and let it expand your mind.  And remember, it's OK to be confused.... <br /> <br />This album is superb - check it out.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Finally after years of fake pop & R&B Stars, silly crunk and the truly dreadful nu gangsta rappers (Including that really horrible gay-unit (I Refused to call it music.)), Mariah Carey has made a comeback and rescuing music from the disaster from it already is, I Thought every single song is great, Mariah can sing again, the song It's like that is the best song I've seen. <br /> <br />This is one of the best albums of 2005 and it surely become a classic. <br /> <br />I Just hope Boyz II Men is next to revive their careers. <br />
B000062XGD|4.0|...that wasn't very hard to make. But in its' \\"simplicity\\" to me it manages to be as complete as it could have been, and that way being some kind of a simple \\"masterpiece\\". Confused? If so I apologize, but the movie I'm trying to write a \\"worthy\\" review of here being as moving and as brilliant as it is for being a movie with very limited dialogue and \\"events\\". Most of the movie taking place at a distant island far from the civilized world, where Hanks' character spends four years after a plane he's on crashes into the sea.  <br /> <br />The silence and the loneliness he feels is brilliant described the way he builds up a relationship with a soccer ball that he paints a face with his blood on. What keeps him alive is the hope of seeing the love of his life again, and finally he takes the risk of setting out to the open ocean not wanting to die alone on that island. Four years as mentioned. <br /> <br />The movie is no lost-island-adventure-movie, not at all. It's a \\"modern\\" drama (though timeless I believe) without pirates and treasures. It seems to focuse on being as realistic as possible, and this way it makes it easy to imagine this mans' desperate situation.  <br /> <br />Not wanting to give too much away here for those of you who haven't seen the movie, \\"Cast Away\\" has perhaps the sadest ending ever in the \\"movie-history\\". Ok, I'm a guy, but the ending here made it almost hard to breathe -and I doubt I'm the only guy who've felt that way seeing it. <br /> <br />So where some find \\"Cast Away\\" disturbingly boring others will find it moving and beautiful. As I did. Because of the fantastic acting (as usual by Tom Hanks, also by Helen Hunt playing his girlfriend), the way we get involved in the lives of the lead characters here -I'd say; Highly recommended! <br /> <br />\\"Cast Away\\" is a one-of-a-kind-movie, and this way it stays with you for a while.
0312995423|3.0|Overall good book by Dan Brown. Almost so faced passed that the characters do not really get a chance to \\"flesh out\\". It doesn't stall once it gets moving and will keep even the shortest attention span glued to it.<br /><br />While surprising plot turns are the hallmark of a Dan Brown novel you will need to suspend disbelief here more than in his other works.<br /><br />Great read for a lazy rainy day.
B0001Z3TS4|5.0|These episodes could certainly use restoration. I didn't give this set five stars for the condition of the episodes. It's too bad they don't look and sound better. This series also doesn't strictly follow Doyle's stories, but I must admit that I absolutely loved watching this. It's fun! I had a blast!  I very much enjoyed the performances of the key actors who played Holmes, Watson, and Lestrade. It's really a delightful little show. I had a wonderful time viewing these episodes and wish they would release the entire series.
1400032717|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, and I only just started reading again after finishing the Da Vinci Code.  Well, I saw this book, and was intrigued by how the book was described.  Having finished this book, I admit that I was incredibly surprised at how good it is.  I could NEVER put it down, it was easy to read, and you really get a feel for the mind of an autistic child.  I recommended this book to a friend who read my copy, and that friend agreed how great a book it is.  Go out and read this, I promise it will change your life.
0393038912|5.0|The author makes a compelling argument for why geography led to <br />Europeans getting the \\"cargo\\" as one of his friends from a less <br />fortunate part of the world put it. <br /> <br />Along the way I learned some fascinating things about <br />human migrations, for example why indigenous people in <br />Fiji resemble indigenous people from sub-saharan Africa <br />instead of Polynesians. I learned why Europeans and Asians <br />domesticated horses, but Africans never domesticated zebras. <br /> <br />I also liked that while the author clearly has deep sympathies <br />for the plight of the indigenous folks across the world that <br />lived in areas colonized by the Europeans, the book never <br />devolves into an anti-white, anti-Europe crusade. Keeping true <br />to his thesis, the author maintains that not only would <br />the indigenous people in the Americas, Africa, and Australia <br />have (eventually reached the technological levels that <br />Eurasia did if they been isolated long enough) but if <br />geographical advantages had been granted to the those three <br />continents, they would have overrun Eurasia, as <br />mercilessly as Europeans did unto America, Africam and Australia. <br /> <br />The author also debunks the myth of indigenous peoples being <br />better stewards of the land. He points out that indigenous <br />peoples wiped out many of the huge mammals in the Americas that <br />might have been domesticated later on. Again,  <br />it was the  geographic advantages of Eurasia that allowed more <br />mega-fauna to survive the slaughter by stone age man <br />than in the Americas.  <br /> <br />At the end of the book I was left with a big picture view of <br />human history that I never had before. <br /> <br />The only defect in this book is the author's explanation for <br />why China (with its higher technology during <br />Europe's dark ages) didn't triumph over Europe as opposed to the <br />other way around. He offers two weak hypotheses. One is that <br />we can't discount the impact of the decisions of absolute <br />dictators, which in the <br />case of China, led to China destroying its Navy, and thus <br />preventing Asia from colonizing Europe and the Americas <br />rather than the other way around. Another is that we haven't <br />quite seen final results; China may yet rise above the rest <br />of the world.  The former seems like a cop out, <br />because the thesis of the book is that geography, and geography <br />alone accounts for how history unfolded. As for the latter, <br />while it is undoutably true that China has risen, this thesis <br />is about the post-industrial age we are in now, and <br />not the pre-industrial and industrial ages, which was the <br />subject of the book. <br /> <br />However, in the newer edition I read, the author updated it <br />with an epilogue with ideas from colleagues. <br />The new thesis satisfactorily explained how geography  <br />allowed China to turn inward, whereas geography forced  <br />Europe to turn outward. Indeed, these ideas are apparently <br />shaping a re-think in the business world for how to stimulate  <br />innovation in large corporations.
B0000067L4|5.0|I respectfully disagree with another reviewer about the dubious quality of \\"Doing that scrapyard thing\\" and \\"What a bringdown\\". Scrapyard is one of my favourite Cream songs, a classic '60s Monty Pythonesque music hall jaunt reminiscent of Beatles offerings like \\"Lady Madonna\\". Great leslie enhanced guitar on this one. Is that Felix Papallardi on keyboards? What a bringdown is a great Baker(?) song. The bridge is classic Jack on vocals. In fact the three studio songs were at the time considered on a par with each other (Badge, of course, gaining wide popularity over time). The lack of soloing on Scrapyard and Bringdown give an indication of perhaps a more ensemble approach which could have developed (ala the Band or Traffic).  The politician and sitting on top versions on this album are outstanding, as is I'm so glad. On comparing this album with Wheels of Fire, the studio cuts are certainly on a par with the lesser heard wheels titles and the live cuts are far more enduring than Toad (unless you're a percussionist). I have fond memories of this album, as I'm sure many others do as well. It marked the poignancy of their breakup as a band. It also pointed to possible new, and unfortunately unrealized within that group, directions. Goodbye was, in fact, a nice bridge (bridge not badge) between Wheels of Fire and the Blind Faith album. Let's hope we hear more of Cream in the future.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|\\"I listen to hip-hop, dude.\\" - Jared Hess <br />Just the sort of transparent, sophomoric drivel you'd expect from the director of a film whose horse-power (or Pegasus-power, more likely) is a high-school weirdo that sketches mythic beasts and fancies himself a paragon of athletic prowess on the tether ball court.  What semblance of a point that exists revolves, presumably, around Napoleon's home-life - with 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) training to be a cage-fighter and human steak-vacuum Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) - and his social-life with Hispanic friend Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) and shy glamour-shot photographer Deb (Tina Majorino).  On the domestic scene, Napoleon clashes bitterly and dorkishly with his Uncle Rico who is there to baby-sit him and Kip while Grandma is in the hospital.  The myriad of pseudo-plots include Kip's online love affair with LaFawnduh (\\"Well, things are getting pretty serious right now, I mean chat online for two hours every day\\"), Uncle Rico's torture over what could have been if Coach had only put him in for the Fourth Quarter back in '82 (\\"I'd have gone pro in a heartbeat, I'd be makin' millions of dollars and livin' in a big ol' mansion somewhere\\"), and the high-stakes, fast-money business of Tupperware (\\"Ya see, this ain't your run of the mill crapperware\\").  Socially, Napoleon conspires to have Pedro Sanchez elected class president despite the efforts of the popular blonde Summer. <br /> <br />Neither artistic nor anti-artistic, the film simply defies categorization.  Stupid, pointless, and totally lacking in anything resembling a redeeming quality, yet hilarious.  Yes, this is a funny movie after all.  Plot is hardly the point where Napoleon Dynamite is concerned, nor is creativity, unity, or anything else.  In fact, the absence of such things is the point itself.  Could anyone other than Heder have played the part so successfully?  My guess is no.  The actor appears to be exceptionally tuned into the awkward, shameless expressions, posturing, and utterances of the dorkiest of High School dorks.  The type of kid who couldn't say a cool word if Dean Martin himself rose from the grave and took a leisure stroll over to his house to give him a free lesson. <br /> <br />Don't be surprised to see this one turn into a cult favorite, encouraging \\"Happy-Hands Clubs\\" the way Chuck Palahniuk's novel/movie inspired fight clubs and rivaling Caddyshack as a veritable reservoir of hilarious quotables.  Well, maybe not that big of a cult hit, but still.  The downfall being, of course, the obnoxious little dweebs that once championed the speech patterns of Beavis and Butthead and Ace Ventura who will now almost certainly deliver a Napoleonic corpse to an early grave because of their constant mimicry.  IDIOTS!
B0007GAERG|3.0|The Return of the Voice would make most Carey fans think of a throwback to her early 90's albums; jamming party grooves and power ballads with notes that last longer than most marriages.  Well, that's only half right.   <br />The uptempo tracks are some of the best she's ever done, even in spite of the overreliance on male guest vocalists (I really hesitate to call some of them singers).  After bubblegum pop gave way to forced I AM SO HIPHOP DANGIT awkwardness, she finally sounds relaxed and confident, letting her voice go with the flow of the song.  Fortunately most of them are smoother than the stuttering single It's Like That, particularly Say Something (featuring pleasantly lazy vocals by Snoop Dogg) and Shake It Off, which based on past albums stands at least 80% chance of becoming a single.  The only one I pass on is Get Your Number, and it's not Carey's fault...Dupri whines the entire way through.  Hire a baritone next time, please. <br />However, other than the predictible but extremely tasty second single We Belong Together, most of the ballads leave me cold.  For some reason she went before the 90's and seems to grab onto 70's sounds--and never lets them go.  Retro is cool in small doses, but it's practically half the album.  If you liked her songs like Fourth Of July or Bliss, you're in luck.  If you're like me, and find tinkly keyboards, bland bass, and a complete lack of beat grating, stay far, far away.  Circles is the only other slow song I don't skip (every time).  Obligatory gospel roof-raiser Fly Like a Bird could have had potential if she had maybe let her adlibs run a minute longer...the song ends so abruptly you'll check your CD player to see if it came unplugged.   <br />And I'll use that excuse to throw in one last complaint...what is with all the ridiculously short songs?  Most are in the 3:30 or less range.  There's no room for adlibs...she can't even finish the last chorus of We Belong Together before the fade out takes over. <br />So this'll never become my favorite album of hers, but there's enough good songs to be worth buying.  The classic-to-filler-ratio is a bit low, but if you're into 70's ballads, you'll be more satisfied.  I can't say much remarkable about her singing since it's neither in full form nor forgettable, and it's enough that most fans should be happy.  It's there, it's good, now just pick better songs.  Highlights:  Shake it Off, To the Floor, Say Something, We Belong Together, Stay The Night..and I guess It's Like That qualifies.
B000002U8G|4.0|The best album of the year and one of the Floyd's best also. <br /> <br />1.One Of These Days- <br />The greatest song on the album next to Echoes. Words cannot describe the driving beat and blues/ psuedo heavy metal jam that creates this song. The coolest part, however, is Rick Wright, speaking through an amplifier and lowered in a tape machine. In an almost demonic voice he bellow's the album's theme... \\"one of these days I'm going to chop you into little pieces!\\" <br /> <br />2.A Pillow Of Winds- <br />A very good Gilmour-led song about life and weather on the English countryside. Great slide guitar. <br /> <br />3.Fearless- <br />A great folk song with beautiful lyrics and powerful, emotional music. The ending is a over lapped recording of a Liverpool soccer audience singing Rodger and Hammerstien's \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\". <br /> <br />4.San Tropez- <br />A funny take on jazz about a man on vacation who promises to see his wife again. <br /> <br />5.Seamus- <br />A very interesting song in which David Gilmour sings back up vocals ans his dog sings lead. The coolest part is the fact that the bloodhound is on pitch most of the time. <br /> <br />6.Echoes- <br />An amzing, psycadellic, and beautiful song in which the lead instrument is a honky tonk piano fed through an rotary amplifier. It starts off instrumentally and soothing. It leads into a simple verse and chorus and short bridge which goes into another verse/chorus. This time the bridge builds up and turns into an almost funk-rock beat. This goes into three minutes of wind, howling, and pianos. The song then returns to the intro but instead of going into the final verse/chorus it builds up into an almost sinister, heavy-metal like beat which goes straight into the verse without a break. After the beautiful chorus ends it goes into a perfect ending. Simply amazing.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Umm, this isn't really a review and it was supposed to be in the 'Dookie' reviews, but I couldn't write 2 reviews for 1 product so that's why I'm here and I'm also here because I wanted to get something straightened out. To J. Johnston from hick country and every one else who actually spent time replying to my review, when I said Billie Joe wrote 'Wake Me When September Ends' in memory of Johnny Ramone, I knew that he wrote it originally in memory of his father who died from cancer when he was only ten. The only reason I said that was because any time he plays the song at their concerts he always dedicates it to Johnny Ramone and also because I was just trying to prove a point, so please don't take it seriously. Oh yeah and by the way, Green Day Rox! So just buy their album already.
B000002U9W|3.0|The first track is a combined effort with The Floyd and Ron Geesin who later made the soundtrack to The Body with Roger Waters. <br /> <br />1.Atom Heart Mother- <br /> <br />Fathers' Shout: Very cool. Though most of it is an orchestra warming up, the ending is friggin' amazing. An electric bass and drums join the horns and strings. <br /> <br />Breast Milky: With a name like this, you only expect weridness, however it's mudnane but kinda cool. A violin leads the organ and bass but the main theme repeats itself. <br /> <br />Mother Fore: Boring but gets better. <br /> <br />Mind Your Throats Please: A rock interlude similar to the bridge of Echoes. <br /> <br />Remergence: A perfect and dramatic ending. <br /> <br />2.If- <br />The best song on the album. Very emotoinal but the live version with Eric Clapton is amazing. <br /> <br />3.Summer '68- <br />Beautiful piano playing and good but abstract lyrics. I love Rick Wright's vocals. <br /> <br />4.Fat Old Sun- <br />Boring and Gilmours vocals can get annoyingly high pitched. <br /> <br />5.Alan's Psycadellic Breakfast- <br />A medley of 3 songs put to sound effects and looped talking of Alan the roadie. All breakfast related but not so psycadellic.

B0007GAERG|4.0|I have been a Mariah fan since 1990, when my older sister introduced me to pop music. And since those days, I have been a Mariah fan ever since. I loved every album until I heard Raibow, which to me was not the same voice I feel in love with and may me realized that she's slowly fading away with her astonishing voice. Glitter and Charmbraclet weren't much better and once again, flop albums. But Emancipation is a definate win over me. The ballads are back, the gospel like vocals have returned, and improved songwriting has emegered all over again, like rebirth.  <br /> <br />If you were a fan until the Butterfly album, then buy this! It is like a Mariah makeover and you know lots of work did go into this album. THe only downer about this album was some of the \\"club\\" tunes, for the most part, they are ok, but it isn't something that put me over the top.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend is very talented I personally am a very strong supporter of the neo soul movement and I thought that, that was what he was about but he's not a pure bred soul artist he's an infuser. Although I at first was disappointed by the lack of morale shown on some of the songs I came to realize he's showing us reality aka real life. Just like everyone else John has layers some bad and some good. This is what his album shows us. He's telling a story about life and we his listeners are priviledged to be able to take a glimpse into it. I have a word of advice for all the haters get a life. Stop looking at others to be role models their human just like us. On a musical note the album is inventive soulful and uplifting it seemed like the album was a story. Starting off with the immature immoral non commital dude (ie. Number One, She don't have to Know and Alright)to the thoughtful, romantic and soulful gentlemen on the likes of Ordinary People and Stay With You for those that want a taste of some creativity and magic hop on the get lifted train. <br /> <br />Bri' 05
006441034X|3.0|While this book did hold my interest and kept me wanting to know how it would all end, I turned the final page with a feeling of \\"What was that all about?\\"  The chapters and plot are pieced together in a sort of ramshackle way that made it hard to really remember the important details along the way because there were simply too many parts that just didn't matter.   Of course, this statement will only lead those who love this story to say that I don't possess the intelligence to comprehend the finer points of this book, but I know for a fact that this book is well below the standard of Tolkien's works, which I have read, and have had no trouble in following, understanding, or remembering. <br /> <br />Character motivations were complete mysteries throughout the book and the ending is so rushed that it all ends before allowing the reader to truly understand what had actually transpired in the story and why.  The dialogue is written in such a way that it almost seems the writer wanted to keep the reader in the dark about what or who they were actually talking about half the time. <br /> <br />As for the humor found in the book, according to the other reviews here, you might be led to believe that you might be left with uncontrollable fits of laughter after reading through the text, but I don't particularly see what's so funny about an arrogant wizard and a stand-offish old woman constantly bickering with each other.  Maybe my brand of preferred humor doesn't rest within the realm of \\"pure sillyness,\\" but that's essentially what this book is: sillyness.
B00079HZUM|2.0|A perfect movie for the Bush era.  Gay men aren't really gay, they only think they are:  Give 'em a good woman and watch 'em come 'round!  Grotesque. <br /> <br />Yes yes, I know, you can finesse greater subtlety from the film if you try.  But as a gay man myself, guess what?  I'm real tired of trying. <br /> <br />I give the film two stars only for the excellence of the performance by Cradup.  Rupert Everett as King Charles is also fun to watch, though personally I think he should have ordered his own beheading for agreeing to appear in this travesty of faith.
0385510438|4.0|Awesome! This is a magnificent meld of Grisham's legal-thriller type stuff with a beautiful story of small-town interactions and friendships. I thought this was a great development in Grisham's writing style, and this was the book that made me want to try The Broker. Definitely pick this up. But DO NOT READ THE INNER JACKET, because it gives away about 70% of the action, and I would have rather seen the plot develop without reading the spoilers in the jacket. I don't know why they put so much info there.
6305807930|4.0|A collaboration between Dario Argento, Lamberto Bava and Mario Bava. \\"Inferno\\" Dario Agrento's semi-sequel to \\"Suspiria\\" has everything Argento fans have come to expect in his movies. Lavishly, saturated with color, gruesome, gory deaths and fallacious plot points.  <br /> <br />Ulike his previous films, \\"Suspiria\\" and \\"Deep Red\\", where there was one straight forward storyline, \\"Inferno\\" is an assortment of set pieces that are cast aside, only to be concluded later with a prodigious, or not so prodigious death. New characters introduced, were only for the purpose of having them killed off. <br /> <br />Argento movies are an acquired taste. His stylistic elements, use of color and angles put him in a class all by himself. However, if this isn't your cup of tea you may be left with insipid plots. \\"Inferno\\" is no different. As I've stated before, if your more into a \\"Scream\\" type of movie then you most likely will not be impressed with this movie, however, if your fan of the stylish Argento type Italian Giallo movies then \\"Inferno\\" should be right up your alley. While it's not Argento's best effort it's well worth a look!
B000002UJQ|4.0|Radiohead aren't so much a band you 'get', so much as a band you 'feel'. They're one of the few bands that I've never really felt on a personal level whilst still thinking they're a great band. Tom Yorke's songwriting is incrdibly heartfelt while Johnny Greenwood's arrangements are arguably the most experimental and diverse in mainstream music from the last 15 years (i.e. there are other bands who easily compete with and/or surpass Radiohead, but are either underground - Devin Townsend or Godspeed You Black Emperor - or from an older generation - Pink Floyd, King Crimson).<br /><br />If The Bends was a stepping stone, it was OK Computer that showed how Radiohead were not just another indie Britrock band. Most of the electronic noises you hear on this album were made on guitar, something that a lot of people don't seem to realise, while the prog-rock sensibilities show how to make experimental and thoughful music without sacrificing feeling or accessibility.<br /><br />I don't think Radiohead will ever be one of my personal favourite bands to be honest. There's something about a lot of their music that doesn't quite hit me. In fact, I often feel that it should be bigger, more powerful and more affecting than it comes across (to me at least). But clearly there are plenty of music fans who feel this music more than I do and regardless of my personal feelings for the band, denying that they're one of the most important bands in modern rock music would be flat out wrong.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I ear this album yesterday in my car. This album is in the old style metode. But with the influence of the style of the 3th. album \\"The Fragile\\". It's very very electronic album. The fans of nine inch nails and the fans of electronic music enjoys very much with this album. The voice of Trent Reznor sounds great, the minimal guitars great as well. The keywoards sounds excelent, and the colaboration with the ex-drummer of Nirvana & singer of Foo Fighters Dave Grohl are amazing, coverall for the faster tracks. When listen the entire album it causes certain sense of deja vu. But this album contains very decent and extraordinary songs like: all the love in the world, the hands that feeds, Every day is exactly the same, only, getting smaller & right where it belongs. It's very decent album still for the problems for the producers.
0679720200|3.0|I think it would be fair to say that this book is an important work in the world of letters that emerged after World War I.  The \\"Great War to End All Wars\\" was a watershed in history because as \\"total war\\" it involved the civilian population as no previous war had.  And because of the many new weapons of mass destruction that were used for the first time, ten million persons died and millions of others were wounded and mutilated.<br /><br />Albert Camus' father, Lucien, was killed in WWI, and I think it would intuitively be realistic to think that this had a profound effect on the thoughtful youth living in straitened circumstances in Algeria. In most cases, the death of a parent will take some of the glow out of childhood. Thus, we see a man who was personally affected and wounded by WWI and a Europe in the throes of disillusionment and recovery after 1918.<br /><br />  To many, WWI was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Why didn't God prevent the war with its enormous suffering?  How could a just and good God allow man to be ruined not only by poverty but also by the havoc of the war machine?  Why would a civilization governed by the rational ideals that reason and goodwill could work things out fail so miserably?  Was the world, and the West in particular, not shaped by the idea that responsible action governed by the moral sense would create and ever-evolving, more perfect world?  And was this not all a wretched lie?<br /><br />Surely then, we can begin to understand how Camus and others began to believe that they were living in an absurd world, a meaningless place, where, nonetheless, one had to go on living, and by one's choices create one's life and, in concert with others, the life of social man.Thus, out of the existential crisis of the moral and economic collapse of WWI, mankind, and European-kind, would rebuild its future out of the welter of lived experience, not on preconceived principles or models provided by religion or \\"bourgeois morality.\\"<br /><br />Thus, we see Camus' development of the absurd.  In The Stranger, Camus uses the term only one time and seems to pass over it lightly giving it relatively little significance.  He says, \\"What few people were about seemed in an absurd hurry.\\"  However, his biographer points out that the entire feeling and mood of the novel really gives us the feeling of the absurd.<br /><br />  \\"There is an irreducible difference between the notion and the experience of the absurd; indeed, `The Myth of<br /><br />Sysiphus might be said to aim at giving us this idea, and The Stranger at giving us the feeling'.\\"<br /><br />How does the absurd arise?  We have already suggested that WWI was the defining event for Camus and many others in bringing meaninglessness to the forefront of consciousness, but this is not to exclude many other elements.<br /><br />\\"The feeling of the absurd can arise in a variety of ways, through, for example, the perception of Nature's indifference to man's values and ideals, through recognition of the finality of death, or through the shock caused by the sudden perception of the pointlessness of life's routine.\\"<br /><br />Because life has become absurd, and because no eternal principles apply to direct this society, then the ultimate question becomes, \\"Why live?\\"  And, if we choose to live, then we must reach some conclusion about how to live, how to move forward day-to-day.<br /><br />\\"Camus is well-known for his statement that `there is only one really serious philosophical problem, that of suicide.  To judge that life is or is not worth the trouble of being lived, this is to reply to the fundamental question of philosophy.'\\"<br /><br />However, Camus does not believe that suicide is the answer.  He believes that man can  devote himself \\"in a self-sacrificing manner to the welfare of his fellow man....if he does so without hope of reward and conscious that in the long run it makes no difference how he acts....it is possible to be a saint without illusion.\\"<br /><br /> The idea of man in the absurd is only partially revealed in The Stranger, but becomes clearer if one reads, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Rebel, and The Plague.  In these works, and others,<br /><br />\\"Human pride and greatness are shown [not] in surrender...but in living in the consciousness of the absurd and yet revolting against it  by man's committing himself and living in the fullest manner possible.\\"<br /><br /> Now, returning to the work The Stranger, we are in a position to answer a number of questions:  Has Camus depicted an absurd world?  Is the absurd a satisfactory alternative to the world of reason and morals that the absurd seeks to replace?  Are any of the characters \\"living in the fullest manner possible\\" or on the road to becoming \\"saint[s] without illusion?\\"<br /><br /> It is apparent that The Stranger does indeed express the feeling or mood of the absurd.  The sense of meaninglessness is palpable, and the pathologies and criminal tendencies expressed in the various characters and relations among the characters are presented without any sense of judgment of their behavior.  They are portrayed as though they are \\"just folks.\\"  Indeed, that is the height of the absurd.  On the other hand, the justice system with all its preconceived judgments about Meursault, about personality, and about sin or right and wrong is portrayed as expressing just so much hot air.  The absurd life for Camus is simply accepting life as it is lived whether or not those lives are or are not being lived according to our preconceived judgments about how life should be lived.  Life cannot be judged.  It cannot be under-stood \\"from the outside.\\"  Indeed, it remains obscure to those living it, but live it they must!<br /><br /> Thus Camus draws a line in the sand.  Which is real life - the lives depicted throughout the book or life seen through the prism of the moralistic magistrate, prosecutor, defense attorney, and prison chaplain?  For this writer, although Camus might wish otherwise, Camus has depicted the problem, but not the solution.  There is clearly a crisis of meaning in the modern world, and I would even state that I think it has reached to a deeper and more critical mass, so to speak, than when Camus was writing.  We have lived through even more horrors than he, and the sense of meaninglessness, even nihilism, is more pervasive than ever.  I even saw a young person with a T-shirt that read, \\"Whoever has the most things when he dies wins.\\"  It would be fair to say that he was proclaiming an absurd view of life.<br /><br />  I do not see any affirmation of \\"saints without illusions\\" in this particular work, and since Camus drew a line in the sand, it is my considered view that the Algerian court system with its perceived anachronistic morals and values is actually closer to truth and \\"reality\\" than Meursault or any of his cohorts.<br /><br /> Camus has not confounded religion with his feeble and spurious unwillingness to repent or believe.  In fact, insofar as we have been given the opportunity to get to know Meursault better than the prison chaplain, we can see that Meursault is far more darkened and hardened that the chaplain might have imagined.<br /><br /> Nor has the novel revealed that middle-class values are empty.  Indeed, the bourgeois goals of the American and French revolutions to provide every citizen with a fair trial exemplifies the inherent kindness and striving for justice that marks the post-Enlightenment, democratic civilization of Western Europe, and, in a different way, the United States of America.<br /><br /> Yes, the crisis of values truly exists. It existed in 1940, and it exists today.  Far too many have rejected the middle way of Aristotle's virtuous man, the \\"golden mean.\\"  Far too many have rejected our institutions as based on lies, and unreal assumptions.  Far too many have rejected faith in the true and living God, the redemptive power of the Cross of Christ.  Yet, giving in to a tidal wave of meaninglessness is not nor ever can be the answer.  The Stranger accurately suggests the parameters for understanding the absurdity of our times, but it does not even begin to suggest an answer that will transform a negative consciousness into a hopeful and happy one.in?

037571412X|5.0|I often am amused at all of the sincere talk about the \\"hollowness\\" of modern man. Time and again we hear about this inability to distinguish between right and wrong, his failure to make the distinction between values and morals and values and truth. Man seems debased by his \\"materialism\\"; an appetite for kitsch and accessories, the never ending search to fill a life with anything capable of depriving him of his instinctive recognition that our society values the wrong things, that our civilization has forsaken what is sacred and true. <br /> <br />And that is all fine and good and probably true but when you read a book like this you think of something else. Man has a \\"complex\\" about morals that exceeds his supposed revulsion of what is permanent and true. We accessorize our morals and values much as we wish to populate our houses with \\"space-enhancers.\\" David Kepesh, the main character, has a son who seems to do everything and anything he can to demonstrate to his father that \\"selfishness\\" is the single greatest cause of our society's travails. Kepesh, a recently retired \\"Aesthetics\\" professor has never had any difficulty walking away from relationships, marriages and other committments if it suited him, but his son views all of this with the revulsion of a child of divorce. Kepesh even is willing to have sexual relations with his students -regardless of age-  provided that they have finished his course. So you can admire the earnestness of this now grown child trying to teach his father to straighten up and fly right, to ameliorate the wrongs of his father's divorces and sweep up the debris of unmet expectations.   <br /> <br />But admiration should be guarded, shouldn't it? Roth, as you should by now expect, takes us further. Kepesh's son is a harried man, frought with the impossible demands of impossible women he must serve because he says, repeatedly, it is his \\"duty,\\" what he must do to be a good man. Kepesh does not understand this behavior even if he can empathize with it, cannot see how assuming gargantuan burdens and being miserable is, in any way, an affirmation of the moral or true. Thus the father cannot do anything more than apologize to his son for disappointing him, He can not lift the psychic stigma that now mars the man he never finished raising. Out of necessity I had to admire Kepesh's detachment here; his son could not convince him of his sins nor compel him to radically alter his \\"sinful\\" life. I offer this comment not as an endorsement of remorseless sinning but as an honest admission of my own fecklessness in the face of sin. Once you have erred you alone do not own your mistake. What can we do to truly right the wrongs we have inflicted upon others either through omission or directly? What if we wound because of who we are and how we feel we must live? Is everything we do so easily understood and accepted by those we love? Roth addresses this issue: If a man spends his life fixated on the wrongs others have done him or what he might have done to others his morality becomes suspect. Such a man would leave himself with nothing but an earnest affirmation of his own inadequacy as opposed to accepting what is truly moral, right and true.  <br /> <br />Having said all of this, I recommend this book for its \\"lighthearted\\" parts as well. Roth has an acerbic and mordant wit that can leave one breathless repeatedly.  <br /> <br />Five stars for this little \\"nugget of wisdom.\\"
0312305060|2.0|Michael Cunningham knows exactly what he's doing, but he doesn't do it well.  I commend him, in part, for a rather objective exploration into female consciousness, and his refusal to dismiss the madness of his characters as simply belonging to the unknowable realm of the female psyche.  As a friend says, Cunningham is able, from a man's point of view, to intellectualize women's emotions, rather than portraying these emotions as irrational and opposed to \\"male\\" concepts of reason and logical intellect.  It seems that female madness has been historically defined as hysterical, while male madness is regarded as \\"misunderstood genius\\".  To me, The Hours helps dismantle that idea. <br /> <br />HOWEVER, I can't read books solely for content.  I find that relevant ideas last--they are debated, reformed, expanded, mulled over and deconstructed.  Poor prose does not.  Cunningham's prose is not awful--but it could use more editing.  Rather than vary his pace to draw out meaning and significance, much of the text labors under unnecessary words. I noticed this immediately in the parenthetical thoughts of each character -- I suppose a nod to Woolf's stream-of-consciousness style.  Observational thoughts like Virginia's and Clarissa's should be quick and transcendent, they should alight upon subjects instantaneously, as real thoughts do.  Instead, Cunningham takes too much time explain what we already know.  Too often he tells the reader how to feel about the character, instead of revealing it through detail.  I would have liked Cunningham to make us care about what Clarissa loves by putting us DIRECTLY in her head; by making us, the audience, a part of her.  The Hours' superfluous, meandering style comes dangerously close to pretentious at times, mostly because Cunningham doesn't immerse us deeply enough into the minds of the characters, while persuading us that we know everything about them -- as if the essence of a person is obtained by: \\"Richard told her, thirty years ago, that under her pirate-girl veneer lay all the makings of a good suburban wife\\" (16).  How?  Why?  What does \\"a good suburban wife\\" mean to Clarissa?  To Richard?  We already know what it means to Cunningham (obviously), but not to the characters; not quite.  <br /> <br />My last complaint is with Cunningham's dialogue.  It is generally flat and often fails to move the story along at the quickened pace which is generally dialogue's purpose.  I understand that Cunningham may have wanted to showcase the superficial politeness of the character's worlds, but the banality of existence is evident in better dialogue than: \\"'But honestly' she says to her husband. 'Why should I wake you,' he answers.  'Why shouldn't you sleep?' 'It's _your_ birthday' she says. 'You need to rest.' (he says)\\" (44-45).  This exchange reveals so little about the characters' real relationship -- and the gap cannot be bridged by Cunningham simply TELLING us about them -- it needs to be clear in what they say.  I feel that even in real life, every word we speak tends to mean something, even if we don't intend it to, and to me dialogue is more interesting when it reflects this.  The novel is unremarkable, precisely because Cunningham could go farther - and yet he doesn't.  He could expand and develop Woolf's characters, ideas and images, and make them into his own.  Instead, the strongest passages and images tend to be taken directly from the original novel he so preciously references.     <br /> <br />*And on a side note, why did Cunningham keep referring to 1941 as the beginning of World War II?  The war began in 1939, and though the U.S. didn't enter until 1941, this shouldn't mark the start of the war to the British.  A petty complaint, but it annoyed me. <br /> <br />
B0007XT87G|4.0|My introduction to Porcupine Tree was with In Absentia (via Steve Wilson's involvment with Opeth's most recent three albums.) It shocked me how good it was, the strength of the songwriting and Steve Wilson's convincing tenor. The idea of course when you like a record this much is to find out what the rest of the artist's records sound like. Next in line was Signify (for no particular reason.) I also fell in love with this and the Stars Die material I heard. So it's no surprise that Porcupine Tree's first new album during my tenure as a fan would be the subject of unrealistic expectations.<br /><br />So, in this way, Deadwing is a disappointment. Not bad, in fact I like it a lot. But it does not live up to the involving alternative rock of In Absentia OR the Pink Floydian space rock musings of Porcupine Tree's Delerium Records material. And that's okay.<br /><br />The biggest difference between In Absentia and Deadwing is the diversity. In Absentia is a diverse, fresh, exciting record. Deadwing on the other hand, consistantly draws from equal parts In Absentia and Dream Theater's most recent work (particularely Train of Thought.) It has its own sound, but at the same time it just sounds too familiar. The much more obvious metal guitar riffing seems to borrowed from the prog metal canon already established by Dream Theater in the last 6 or 7 years.<br /><br />Still, the record is great where it counts and when Steve Wilson is doing what he's best at - singing addictive melodies over compelling chord changes. Parts like the chorus in \\"Shallow,\\" all of \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" and \\"Open Car\\" and the second half of \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" are all standouts on this album. \\"Lazerus\\" is nice too, but on the other hand it also feels like a shameless plea to mainstream radio for support. And with it, Porcupine Tree will probably find it.<br /><br />But the biggest single difference between this and In Absentia is this: unlike going out with an emotional bang as was the case with \\"Collapse the Light Into the Earth,\\" Deadwing just... cools off, gradually during the last couple songs.<br /><br />Overall, very good record, detered mostly by it's inability to live up to the incredible example set by Porcupine Tree's previous albums.as the case with \\"Collapse the Light Into the Earth,\\" Deadwing just... cools off, gradually during the last couple songs. <br /> <br />Overall, very good record, detered mostly by it's inability to live up to the incredible example set by Porcupine Tree's previous albums.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I bought this CD about 8 months ago, I still lisiten to it almost everyday. I started off with American Idiot when the single came out in September,I love the song, then I went out and got the CD. I find American Idiot very different then all of Green Day's other stuff. I wouldn't call most of the songs it &quot;punk rock&quot; because it's not, it's a more of a rock based album. The 2nd song, &quot;Jesus of Suberbia&quot; is very different than any other song out there. It's a couple shorter songs made into one long one (more than 9 minutes long) when I first heard of this song I thought that it wasn't going to go together well with all of it's different parts, but I was wrong it flows together really well,it tells a story and overall it's a great song. <BR>This album is very political in some spots the song &quot;Holiday&quot; is a great example of this, it is anti-war, it's a very direct song and does not tip toe around the subject. Most people would not expect Green Day to put out a song like this with a serious subject matter, but they do a great job of getting their point across. Also the song American Idiot is very direct, it's a good tune. This CD show's that Green Day has grown up quite a bit, although they still have a few song's that would crack you up on this CD, such as in the song &quot;Homecoming&quot; The drummer sings his little song called &quot;Rock and Roll Girlfriend&quot;, personally I find it hysterical. Probably the most serious song on this album is &quot;Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot; it was written about the death of Billie Joe Armstrong (lead singer)father's passing away, it's one of those songs that gives me cold shivers, still when I lisiten to it, lyrically it's is amazing, it's one of those songs that you find yourself able to relate with the feelings of the song, in all honesty the song makes me cry.<BR>Overall this CD is a great one, probably one of the best (or the best) that I have in my collection. If you don't have it, goout and get it! All the song's on the CD, are so good, not just the ones I talked about.

B0000024K1|5.0|Its the truth, Public Enemy's album \\"It Takes A Nation Of A Million To Hold Us Back\\" was the best rap album of all time. It was like a hand grenade expolding into kids, and adults ears. With Chuck D's Extremly harsh yet inovative politcal lyrics, Public Enemy was a sign of change, a movment in some way. Every song on here was like the President standing up on the podium for a speach. Chuck D was that President using his inovative lyrics to speak to the American People about the troubles of the American Politcal System. Do yourself a favour and get this album take some history into your ears. Oh and for you WHO dont know that Flava Flav was a character foil, and the beat producer you people are just plain stupid.
0679720200|5.0|Absurd, in the sense that Camus uses it, has less to do with the everyday notion of \\"ridiculous\\" or \\"non-sensical\\" as some reviews here suggest, but with the idea that we seek some universal, transcendental meaning for Life in a universe essentially devoid of meaning.  <br /> <br />That Meursault is defined by many readers as \\"insensitive\\" or \\"bizarre\\" or \\"abnormal\\" simply reveals a basic need to categorize Meursault in a value system. However, this is precisely what Camus puts into question: assuming and applying values in a universe where values have no place or meaning is absurd. It is a futile gesture. This is what makes the court scene the absurdity it is, as it confronts someone who is evidently amoral and then condemns him in the name of all that is right and decent in society. \\"Right\\" and \\"decent\\" are the precious ideas we collectively fabricate for ourselves and maintain in order to help us feel that there is an essential order and justice in the universe and that there is a \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" distinguishable to all. But Camus book suggests--without denying the usefulness of such ideas--that this is a human thing: Meursault's actions (killing an Arab, not crying at his mother's funeral) are devoid of meaning ...from a universal perspective.  <br /> <br />Everybody dies anyway, so what difference how and whether sooner or later? That's just the way things are.  <br /> <br />Now, a thought experiment for those who keep Camus and his ideas at a safe reading distance: imagine witnessing a car accident...where children are involved. This happened to me in Madrid over 8 years ago, where I witnessed from a distance one maniac car tearing right through the car of a lone mother...with kids. The ramming car didn't stop: it just tore on. I shan't give any more details, as it is too painful. Now think, for a split second, how every feeling of horror, distress, and ultimately anger...the awfulness of it all. Then consider, if you can, the comforting stories offered bypriest or psychologist to the remaining family. Perhaps you are the remaining kin. How profoundly inadequate and futile these must seem to cover one's sudden, naked exposure to the obvious indifference of the universe. Any attempt to give meaning to the event seems completely at odds with what suddenly, inexplicably happened. It just happened. That is all. The universe remains, unchanged. The word \\"tragedy\\" may provide an inadequate handle on events. But the senselessness, meaningless of it all has been glimpsed.

B00005K9LK|4.0|<br />Many casual listeners like SFV because it has their biggest hit \\"Another Thing Coming\\".  Other songs on the album are of the same type: Catchy, classic Priest tunes which work well in an arena setting, with Halford's operatic screaming, and the dual guitars chugging.  <br /> <br />For these reasons, it's a good starting point for those new to Priest.  But it sounds dated when I listen to it now.  Defenders..., Hell Bent..., and British Steel have aged better. <br /> <br />The production is inferior to both their earlier and later albums.  It sounds blurry, distant and amateurish. <br /> <br />A full recommendation to casual listeners and those who want an introduction to JP, but only a partial one for metalheads, who should explore their other work to get a full appreciation of the band and their influence. <br /> <br />Songwriting: 9/10  <br />Musicianship: 8/10  <br />Sound Quality: 5/10  <br />Originality: 9/10 <br />Listenability: 6/10

Anchorman is a hilarious film that only gets better with time.

And you have to be in the mood for it. <br /> <br />Those who downrate it for those reasons probably don't let their kids celebrate Halloween.  This album is like a good horror movie.  Part of the appeal is a fascination with the macabre side of music.  If you're easily shocked or offended, I suggest you try Barney's Greatest Hits instead. <br /> <br />Nothing is quite like Slayer's evil wall of sound.  And this album is their best example of it.  Other bands continue to try with over-the-top speed, lyrics, screaming, etc.  Although there will always be a market for ever-more-extreme noise for mall rats to piss off their parents, Slayer's brand of noise has stood the test of time like no other extreme metal band. <br /> <br />Whatever the critiques, I listen to this often in the car--all the way through, without skips.

B000089RVX|4.0|Angelic, operatic like, yet powerful vocals; very tight rhythm and generous use of acoustic piano accompanied by heavy guitars and bass, and sweet hip-hop/funk drums. The first three songs take you on a medium to fast paced ride, including big radio hit 'Bring Me To Life' and then they floor you when they hit the breaks on 'My Immortal', making you really stop and listen; very nicely done and unexpected. 'Haunted' is a real grunger with incredible vocal harmonies laid tastefully on top followed by an actual choir joining in at the songs climax - awesome! The pace picks up a bit with the next couple of songs and then another ballad in the form of 'Hello' which somehow carries with it an almost Irish folk influence or atmosphere; perhaps reminding me of another song; very, very pretty.  <br /> <br />The album is very 'complete' and well arranged but what you start to notice is a formula taking place which can, and in the past has for other bands, become the downfall of this band. The musical arrangements or components of the songs are very similar to each other and follow the same theme or feel. This would be fine if it wasn't so repetitive. Having a theme is fine because you do want a mood, if you will, to carry you. It's part of what makes an album memorable and distinct. However, it will definitely take some reinventing for a follow-up release not to fall by the way side as has for so many bands in the past. I forget who said 'You have your whole life to write your first album and maybe nine months for your sophomore effort\\" and it's utterly true. I honestly do not see many more variations of the current formula working for too long. All in all an excellent piece of work and I strongly recommend it. <br />

No skips. <br /> <br />Those who say it's not a \\"concept\\" album in the ugly sense of the term are correct.  You have the themes of religion and street people.  But you won't be bored by the excesses which characterized lot of \\"concept\\" albums of that era. <br /> <br />I was introduced to JT through FM radio and a greatest-hits album.  When I bought Aqualung in order to have one of their real albums, I was more than pleasantly surprised.  It became one of my favorites. <br /> <br />What you'll get is a nice balance between JT's folk and hard rock sides. <br /> <br />You've probably heard the title track, \\"Locomotive Breath\\", \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\", and \\"Hymn 43\\" on the radio.  But you'll also get \\"My God\\" and \\"Wind Up\\", which not only rock musically, but are excellent takes on disillusionment and religion.  In-between are acoustic, folky, but catchy tunes like \\"Mother Goose\\" and \\"Up To Me\\" to balance things out. <br /> <br />Radio-friendly and accessible, yet edgy, intelligent, and high-quality, a combination you'll find with very few bands and very few albums. <br /> <br />Songwriting: 10/10  <br />Musicianship: 10/10  <br />Sound Quality: 8/10  <br />Originality: 10/10 <br />Lyrics: 10/10
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Please if you are looking for good time to pass watching movies, for god sakes don't watch this one, you're going to lose your time and money, it is so stupid, it's boring, the plot and story are horrible, the characters are bad, I read the comic and I thought the movie was going to be cool, but it was really, really bad, I only enjoy 10 minutes of it, it is going to bore you too, I can assure you that.
B00004XONN|4.0|I recently made myself a compilation of the best songs in my opinion of both kid a and amnesiac, and it goes a little something like this: <br /> <br />1.Everything in it's right place <br />2.Pyramid song <br />3.The national anthem <br />4.Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box <br />5.How to disappear completely <br />6.Like spinning plates <br />7.Idioteque <br />8.Moring bell <br />9.I might be wrong <br />10.Life in a glass house <br />11.Dollars and cents <br />12.Motion picture soundtrack <br /> <br />Like most of you know, Kid A and Amnesiac were recorded at the same place, at the same time, and are therefore issued from the same creative process.  <br /> <br />It seems to me as if there is a hidden reason why these albums were not released as a whole, because it would have undoubtedly made the greatest album in their repertoire. Ok Computer is far greater than Kid A or Amnesiac for the sole reason that it has better songs, while the other two have as many fillers as memorable songs that shimmer with genius.  <br /> <br />The songs that I left out in my compilation are songs that could have been decent B-sides and played live. No more, no less. <br /> <br />Sure, this collection lacks the flow, the transition that Ok computer had, but if Radiohead had made the album this way, it would be an all-time classic, alongside Floyd's Dark Side, and the like.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This movie is amazing, it-s superb, it has great special effects, a great story with great characters, if you are looking for extremely good action, watch this one, believe me it is one of the greatest action movies ever made, you won`t get dissapointed I really can assure you that.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I got this album when it first came out on vinyl and thought it Neil's best album along with the harrowing Tonights the night. I read David Crosby ridiculing this album in Record collector a few years ago, and that has got to be enough of a recommenation to go out and buy it. Crosby has had a less than stellar solo career. This album, for me is somewhere between the Goldrush stuff and Crazy horse. I like the lyrics here especially, very different and memorable. The music is tasty without drowning out the lyrics as I feel is the case in some of the Crazy horse stuff. Nice album all round. It's nice to finally have a copy on CD
B00003CXCT|5.0|I'm sorry for those who were upset by it...But I like it... <br /> <br />I'm truely sorry, But I got so tired of popping in my ORIGINAL VHS tapes of the Original Trilogy, which were only worsening throughout the years. (Please note...I am Practically 16 though, so I've grown up very used to this technilogic movie awesomeness). <br /> <br />As much as I loved them, I couldn't handle the VHS anymore, I'm too adapted to the DVD player with Digital Sound and Video. Some of the changes made me go \\"WHA!?\\", like the Gungans at the end of Return of The Jedi (the Hayden replacing the orignal Anakin spirit really didn't bother me). But some others were awesome. Like I've heard people complain about the Emporer scene change in ESB, but I think that was needed. The first spin around it wasn't good old evil Ian playing the Emporer...and was totally off the Emporer's character. So that change I was VERY happy of. As for the dialouge there, yea it's kind of weird, but I think it makes sense. <br /> <br />I like how it's crisply put together now, with very good sound, updated lightsaber quality, and ship quality and all that. <br /> <br />Again just a reminder, I am 16...I really like Digitally Remastered.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|I am a huge Mariah fan and know all her work. The last 2 or 3 albums were a disappointment in terms of choice of songs. Her voice seemed to have become weaker too as compared to 'Emotions', 'Music Box' and the Christmas Album. 'Emancipation' sees Mariah go back to  the credible artist that she is. Songs like 'Joy Ride' and 'Circles' take her older fans back to her golden years. Songs such as 'We Belong Together' and 'To the Floor' cater to her new fans and the current generation. Her voice seems to be stronger as compared to 'Charmbracelet'. It probably speaks to the choice of songs and music on each album. However, in some aspects, I feel she is imitating the younger r&b artists of today, most of whom fashioned themselves after her. She is the original. Overall, I am proud of her and happy to see her on a comeback trail. Get this disc. You will not be disappointed.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I'm 16 years old right now, and when I was young and growing up I constantly watched all the Star Wars films. I loved them, they were awesome... <br /> <br />This came out when I was 10. Naturally in my 10 year old nerd self, When I saw previews for Star Wars episode I, I freaked. I was like \\"YEAH!!!\\". SO I saw it...and hey it was good. <br /> <br />I can agree, NOT the original. But still, GOOD. I really liked it. I though it was a good way to get a jump into Anakin's life. (Sorry...I wasn't one of the fans hoping for the prequel's to START at Episode III and continue on...Though I would love to see some new Vader action).  <br /> <br />I can agree with the annoyances, like Jar Jar Binks and 90% of the gungans...(But hey...Jar Jar had some great lines in there...\\"My give up...My give up!\\"). I did, however, like seeing young Obi-Wan, and I thought Qui Gon Ginn was one of the coolest Jedi's ever. I don't know why, but after seeing episode I I thought Qui Gon was cool. <br /> <br />Overall...yea this DVD is on my shelf...
B000069AUI|5.0|I bought this cd when it was released in 2002 and I still love it.  Politik, The Scientist, A Rush of Blood to the Head, and the very end of Amsterdam are absolutely amazing.  You have to be a genius to come up with such amazing ballads such as these.  I can't wait to see them in concert, and when I do, I'll pay top dollar to get the best seats!
0440180295|5.0|This is my favorite Vonnegut so far.  I didn't read it at first because the title was unappealing.  But I enjoyed other Vonneguts, so eventually tried this one.  It is excellent.   <br /> <br />One error keeps appearing in other reviews here that for some reason is bothering me.  Billy's trip to Tralfamadore did NOT teach him how to travel in time, and he did NOT travel at will.  On the first page of Chapter 2: \\"Billy is spastic in time, has no control over where he is going next, and the trips aren't necessarily fun.\\"  Later in the same chapter: \\"The Tralfamadorians didn't have anything to do with his coming unstuck.  They were simply able to give him insights into what was really going on.\\"   <br /> <br />Thank you for listening, and enjoy the book.  One other thing: Chapter 1 may put you off and seem boring.  If necessary, you could start at Chapter 2 (the real beginning) and read Chapter 1 later after you are hooked.
B0007GADZO|5.0|I had been looking forward to the release of this album for a long time, and became slightly wary after reading a few of the reviews on this site (there is a fair amount of negativity).  Needless to say, I went ahead and bought it, and sat in my living room at night with the sound way up, through a pair of headphones.  It FAR exceeded my expectations. <br />There is a bit of everything on this album; you have the complexity and depth of \\"Freak Show Excess\\" (not to mention the super human time signatures), contrasted with the absolute simplicity of \\"Yai Yai\\"; the dramatic heaviness of pieces like \\"Building The Church\\" and \\"Midway Creatures\\", contrasted with the tenderness and delicacy of \\"Lotus Feet\\" (one of the best pieces Vai has ever writted by the way, IMO).  There is a nice blend of instrumental and vocal music - and his voice is superb (it has come on a LOT, as some have already mentioned).  The guitar work throughout is fantastic and fresh, the band (Billy Sheehan and Jeremy Colsen, amongst others) are superb throught and provide an awesome grounding in every piece. <br />As I say in the title: this is a work of art, plain and simple.   <br />A word of warning to the \\"aurally selective/sensitive\\": <br />If you are someone who likes to hear very simple melodies that dont require much serious listening, and are designed to hook -- then I would advise you not to buy this album (it is very experimental, and if thats not your cup of tea, then you would be wasting your money). <br />Also, if you are someone expecting to buy a straight rock/metal album, I would again advise you not to buy this (for the same reason). <br /> <br />If you are someone who appreciates this kind of experimentation, is willing to let your ears take you somewhere higher.........and maybe has quite a strong sense of spirituality too --- then I would STRONGLY advise you to buy this album. <br /> <br />Keep up the great work Mr Vai
B0000027I6|2.0|I'm a huge PF fan, but I feel like after David Gilmore and Roger Waters split up, they never really reached their potential.  Gilmore's first solo came close.  This moody album doesn't live up to the standards set by previous PF albums.  While I'm no fan of the present course of civilization, I didn't find these lyrics to be particularly profound or persuasive and I really miss the guitar and harmonies from the good ole days.
B000002GVO|1.0|The Eagles represented everything bad about music and nowhere better do they show us how bad they were than on this album. Album sales are always open to debate, especially where this band are concerned, but one fact remains, this album sold in the millions, but then again lots of sales do not prove an album is any good and the eagles proved that wit this monstrosity. Avoid.
078322608X|5.0|This is a great movie, plain and simple. If you have the mind to comprehend anything deeper than a chick flick, or Star Wars Episode I, pick this up as soon as you can and check it out. No, you might no get it the first time through, but thats what makes movies like \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" and \\"The Matrix,\\" so interesting - they keep you engaged and force you to question everything you see. Unlike the snoozer \\"Donnie Darko,\\" 12 Monkeys is complete and makes sense, and has an astonoshing ending. Hint: don't assume you undersand how the movie presents time travel.  <br /> <br />Top notch. See it today. Grade: A.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Ryan Adams latest double-disc, Cold Roses, is one of his best.  Often a victim of his own prolific pen, Adams loves genre; Cold Roses falls on the alt-country side of his resume, along with Whiskeytown and Heartbreaker, but these songs are also steeped in the hardcore folk of the Grateful Dead (circa Workingman&iexcl;¯s Dead) and the n¨·-folk of Iron and Wine and The Lighthouse Family.  Yet it&iexcl;¯s more than consistency of sound that lifts these songs to the top of Adam&iexcl;¯s heap ¨C it&iexcl;¯s the interaction with a whip-smart band that&iexcl;¯s more than just backup here (hence their addition to the title); the Cardinals are a snarling entity that don&iexcl;¯t just prettify Adams sad tales of love-gone-bad.  They prod him, cajole him, raise him up when redemption calls.  And with a band this ace, you can damn well bet redemption is on its way.  &iexcl;°Life Is Beautiful&iexcl;±, Adams reminds us, but it&iexcl;¯s a long hard road from &iexcl;°Sweet Illusions&iexcl;± to &iexcl;°How Do You Keep Love Alive&iexcl;± and those pesky metaphorical &iexcl;°Cold Roses&iexcl;± themselves until he gets there.  As they say, the journey is all.
B0006GAOBI|2.0|I'm sure there are many attempts on the internet to figure out all the inner workings of this film, but i couldnt help but wonder whether the film itself knew what it was talking about. Sure, you had weird rabbits, numbers, time travel... but with all of these details and elaborate connections, we never really get a sense of the heart of the movie - only a glimpse at a glitch in time which results in a boy choosing to die when he has the chance. This movie promises to be something big and intreguing, but it never tells us why. All we are left with is the green rabbit, \\"cellar door,\\" and perhaps a vague impression that Donnie doesnt think we're alone. So what? It seems to me that ll the hype surrounding this movie is an attempt to find completion in the mediocre ending. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a serious thought provoking, time travel movie, check out Terry Gilliams \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" instead.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Phantom was the first musical I was introduced to in my teens and have been able enjoy the show a few times.  I was really excited to hear about this movie but had reservations too.  Nothing will ever replace seeing this in person.    The GOOD!!!!    Now I do think they had (Christine and the Phantom) good chemistry and the movie wasn't a total loss.  I liked the scenery and liked the back stage action that you really don't see in the musical show.      The score was great.    I did like the black and white sequences - especially the ending with the rose on Christine's grave.  I was enthralled with the beginning with the illumination of the chandelier.    The supporting cast was good to great.  I liked Carlotta.    THE BAD!?!?!?!?!    First I think the director missed the point of filming a musical.  This is not MTV so what is with the cuts every 3 to 5 seconds.  The music is so flowing that it does a great injustice to the music to be so choppy visually.    Second, I am very disappointed with the Phantom.  Don't get me wrong he wasn't that bad, but the Phantom is supposed to be older - to establish a father/daughter relationship that turns into the older gentleman young maiden relationship that happens when Christine matures both in musical abilities and physically.  Also as the teacher he seduces Christine with his singing abilities.  In this movie Christine is clearly the stronger of the two so that the seduction didn't happen because of the voice but due to the \\"looks\\" of the younger phantom???    The point of the story is that the beautiful Christine did actually fall in love with the voice of the phantom and could have looked past his disfigurement were it not for his murderous ways.  As presented in the film that was not the case.      I give it 3 stars but would give it 3.5 if I could.  The movie lacks the subtlety that is evident in the book and the Musical.  It is enjoyable but clearly it could have been better
B000002UAU|5.0|This album is my favorite Beatles album by far, and should be yours too. It has great songs, and is a very influential album. I recommend this to anybody looking at the Beatles for the first time, and also current Beatles fans that have not yet experienced this album.
B000929AJQ|5.0|And how could I not be pleased. All you 3 stars and 2 stars.. obviously you do not realize something about this album. I must congradulate Mr. Reznor on his newfound sobriety. It must have been  very hard to give up. Anyway, my point is that this album contains a lot of locked up pain, and also newfound hope, and happiness. That is what I find so neat about this album. Sure it's not a \\"The Fragile\\" or \\"The Downward Spiral\\", but it's his first album sober, and he still has everything he used to.   <br /> <br />While as \\"The Fragile\\" was a deep journey into the human psyche, including a few pit stops of depression, happiness, constant sadness, and pain, \\"With Teeth\\" has more angst, while at the same time more happiness, and one can definitely see the transformation Trent has gone through. <br /> <br />The songs on here are very well crafted, and the music is simply excellent. My personal favorites are \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\", and \\"Sunspots\\". By the way, \\"Every Day is Exactly the same's\\" chorus is repetitive for a reason folks, think about it. <br /> <br />Anyway, \\"With Teeth\\" is a piece of art for this time of horrible reprocessed music. The funny thing is that NIN is still relatively popular, and it's a good thing Trent hasn't changed anything. We don't need a musical genius turning into a pop junky for MTV. Do yourself a favor, buy \\"With Teeth\\" if your really familiar with them, or if your trying NIN for the first time. It's surprisingly a good album to start out with, and maybe their most accessible. Then go from there. I know next up for me is \\"The Fragile\\". \\"The Great Below\\"(The Fragile) is probably one of the best songs ever recorded.  <br /> <br />Have fun listening.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I gotta say that Wesley Walton's review made my skin crawl.First of all,NIN is angst.If you are too \\"grown Up\\" for it,listen to something lighter.    Also-the lyrics are not something a 14 year old would write.But something a 39 year old who battles drug addiction and chronic depression would write.Almost every song expresses a side of addiction,from fear to regret to self loathing to anger.Yes,dark subjects.But this is Nine Inch Nails.No one listens to NIN for love songs and faith in human kind.    but the angst is more like Pink Floyd then anything today.    Trent is singing about his life.What would these reviews want?Trent to turn into the cliched,get- a- haircut&join- society,have a couple of kids and sing sleepy lullabies for the rest of his life?Well,most early 90's Alt. singers have done that.And they are as relevant today as one of Eddie Vedder's more recent mumbles.    now the music-I honestly think these reviewers only listened to the hit single,maybe 2 other songs and base their reviews on that.Because most of the songs are extremely multi layered,and yes experimental.Trent again takes risks instead of playing it safe.    I am a fan since the Pretty Hate Machine days too,and am very suprised and pleased at how good this album is.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Once again, Ryan Adams as created a fabulous album!  It is great to hear that he went back to his country roots for this one.  I love his recent pop/rock CDs - Gold, Demolition and Rock 'n Roll - but his country stuff is so great.  I'm still discovering this CD and have yet to really pull out the songs I will call my favorite, but I am enjoying every minute of it thus far!
B0000B1OE7|5.0|I read a review warning viewers about being tricked by the widescreen presentation of the movie.  The only reason there is a widescreen version is for those who have high definition televisions.  Yes the original version of the movie is a 4x3 picture, but for those of you who are watching on an HD tv or projector, you will probably enjoy it.  The Widescreen presentation is actually animorphic, so aside from the picture being zoomed in to cut off the top and bottom of the picture it looks really crisp on a 16x9 screen.  If you are watching on a regular television and enjoy widescreen more than fullscreen, don't waste your time with this edition.  However, if you enjoy the movie and want to watch a nice HD picture, then go ahead and try it out.  just note that on the back of the box it does say at the bottom that the widescreen version was motified from its original to fit 16x9 televisions.

B00005JMAH|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Harry and his wand-waving friends return in \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\\" the third in the series of high-flying adventures by British author J.K. Rowling.<br /><br />This latest film finds a more grownup Harry being pursued by the evil Sirius Black, who has just performed the unprecedented feat of escaping from a prison for wayward warlocks.  As Sirius moves inexorably closer to his intended victim, Harry learns some surprising details about the murder of his beloved parents.<br /><br />\\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is a pretty decent installment overall, although it could use some tightening here and there to make it more streamlined and evenly paced (the film runs an overlong two hours and twenty-two minutes).  The production design and special effects are as stunning as ever, as once again we are transported to a visually beautiful world of unbridled fantasy and imagination.  One of the reasons why the Harry Potter works are so popular is that they root their stories in characters who are realistic and believable, so that even amidst all the riding of brooms, casting of spells and reciting of incantations, Harry, Ron and Hermione are able to keep their feet on the ground and their hold on the audience.<br /><br />Although many people have noted a \\"darker\\" element running through this film, I really didn't see it, and, in fact, I think \\"Prisoner\\" is less intense than the second - and best - installment, \\"Chamber of Secrets.\\"  Although there seems to be enough creativity in the original concept to support a few more \\"Potter\\" movies, even Potter-maniacs may feel that at least some of the bloom has begun to fade from this particular rose.  I guess only future installments will truly tell.

B00063MBU8|1.0|I loved Simple Plan's first album, \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls.\\" It was a fun, upbeat album that portrayed teen angst through some happy, pop music. Everyone who listened knew it was shallow, manufactured pop music, but that's why I enjoyed it so much. It wasn't supposed to be taken seriously. <br /> <br />Then Simple Plan went through a makeover. Instead of bouncing around to songs such as 'God Must Hate Me' (One of my personal favorites), they decided to become a musical conglomerate of pseudo-emo, pop, punk, and rock. So instead of bopping around to happy songs, they simply whine about the struggles of the average teenager. What a downer. On one track there's even screaming in the background. <br /> <br />Simple Plan is swimming in a pool of denial if they think they've become some kind of deep, philisophical pop stars. Plus, they're all hitting their mid 20s and still whining about how they can't get any. And the last song, \\"Untitled,\\" provides the cherry on top of this cake. It's the ultimate in contrived, pop music crap. <br /> <br />Listen to either their first album or listen to a band like Fall Out Boy. This album is terrible.
0553579908|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series, but I cannot deny that there are parts of these books that tie my stomach in knots.  There have been some scenes that I had a hard time getting through.  If these books were movies, I don't think I could watch (they would definitely receive an NC-17 rating).  I honestly believe that if nothing here disturbs you, you're probably a sociopath. <br /> <br />But these these are isolate scenes.  They are the exception.  They are the exclamation points, surrounded by a brilliant story.  The fact is, often the most horrific events are the most profound.  You wouldn't read a book about the westward expansion of white men in the American west and expect it to be completely happy.  You wouldn't read a book about any war in human history and expect to not encounter brutality.  And GRRM does not play around.  If you want a happy, feel-good story, this is not it.  But if you want a truly amazing story, a book you will not be able to put down, intrigue that will keep you awake at night, plot twists and characters that will amaze you - then give these books a try.   You won't be sorry!
0316168815|5.0|What makes this book so different is its focus on the aftermath of a murder from the view point of those affected. In a world where we focus rarely on the victim and the huge affects a life altering tragedy can have as it ripples through the fabric of the lives involved. The characters are so well constructed that it makes the book come alive. The emphatic Ruth is so clearly modeled after author. The actions of the murder are only tangential to the book. Highly recommend this book.
1892065290|5.0|There are so many reviews that maybe one more is silly, but I just had to add my two cents.  I think these are about the best books I have ever read.  Very few authors even come close.  Please see my review of the third book (spoiler free, I promise).<br /><br />I have seen that many of the critics are saying that there is too much sex and violence.  I don't think the sex is overly done at all.  In real life, real politics (and this book is very much about politics), real relationships, sex is a factor.  That is just realistic.  It is also true that there is a lot of violence - we are talking about war.  And while some of the scenes will turn your stomach, that's the point.  War is horrible - and the point is that the innocent bystanders often suffer the most.  So is it too much?  Well, it's definitely too much for adolescents in my opinion.  As for adults, it depends on what you're looking for I guess.  These books will leave you lying awake at night (assuming you were able to put them down and go to bed in the first place) contemplating the horror of it all.  But you will also lie awake wondering what is going to happen next.  You'll look ahead to see how many pages until you get to your favorite POV again.  You'll change your mind about who is good and who is bad.<br /><br />Critics are also saying there are too many characters.  And I can't really argue that - there are a lot of minor characters.  But again, I think it's just realistic.  This is a story about kingdoms and families.  Of course there are lots of people.  Read history - you'll find lots of people.  That's sortof the nature of humanity!  If there were only a few characters, the plot would not be nearly so intricate or intriguing.<br /><br />And while some are saying that all the rave is simply because we don't want to bash something that others love, I would say the opposite.  I'm willing to bet that some of the critics are calling it trash just to be different.  So the only thing I can say is, read it and decide for yourself., read it and decide for yourself.   <br />
B00062IVKI|2.0|The best way to describe this film is \\"The Way We Were\\" meets Martin Scorsese.  First, take Barbara Streisand and replace her with Liza Minelli--similar talents, both great singers,  ok actresses, no problem, thankyou!  Now take Robert Redford and replace him with Robert DeNiro playing the character he played in \\"Goodfellas\\"--or better yet--playing the Joe Peschi character from \\"Goodfellas\\"--that might be closer.  Just put a saxophone in his mouth and track over some nice tunes between the tough guy this, tough guy that and... What?  And that's what it looks like we see Minelli's character thinking over and over again--\\"what?\\"  Is somebody kidding?  Is this a musical?    The first time I saw \\"New York, New York\\" was on television and I didn't know then, and was so surprised to see in the opening credits, that it was directed by Martin Scorsese.  I had no idea that this glitzy musical which had been on the periphery of my consciousness for twenty years was directed by the moviemaster El Supremo.   AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THAT IS IT'S BIGGEST PROBLEM--IT'S A SCORSESE FILM!    Basically, a schizophrenic movie. It could have been Barbara Streisand, or it could have been \\"Goodfellas,\\" but what it ends up being instead is sadly bizarre. It's Scorsese doing his Scorsese standards, and Scorsese doing other things such as Scorsese the jazz enthusiast putting forward the music he loves and mixing it all up in motifs that are consciously derivative of the golden age of musicals. It's sometimes flashy, sometimes gritty, often tense, most often fabulously designed, and in unexpected ways, often floppy.  First Scorsese will put Minelli on the stage to do some nicely projected wonderfuls.  Then he'll add DeNiro to the stage with the typical Scorsese/DeNiro streetwise dialogue, gambled emotions, and looming catastrophes. Luckily, or perhaps unluckily, depending on your expectations, these catastrophes get negotiated away from the usual Scorsese violence by Minnelli's clever and loving, but undiscovered character.  Why these two people are together is never understandable, and we watch Francine (Minelli) many times just stop and stare at Jimmy (DeNiro), pause, and then resign herself to him.  Why does she resign herself to him?  Who knows? Because it's a Scorsese film, what else?  That could be the only reason.  There must be something intelligent about it.  If it's because she loves him, then this woman has real problems--but perhaps that was the heart of the plot, along with her ability to see into him and work with him, in spite of his flaws and floating-point sincerity, but what she sees in him is lost to the viewer.  We don't really know what's going on in her head--her character, even more than his, is never illuminated--and this dim-lit combination just doesn't sustain interest and doesn't ever go anywhere truly compelling. Just having a jerk for a mate doesn't make a movie. You could call this film, \\"The Sad Story of the Woman Who Falls for a Line.\\" The conflict-resolution pattern in the relationship was barely interesting at the beginning--and it had a few fun moments--such as during the Justice of the Peace scene--but if this is romance, give me \\"Sid and Nancy\\" instead.     By the middle of the picture I basically no longer cared what happened with these two people, just so long as Minnelli sang.  The plot flounders propped up next to the music and the pathos at the end was barely a tear, if that.   What were the why's and wherefore's, and how did all this narrative amount to almost 3 hours of importance? I suspect it was mostly just a compilation of improvisations within formulas.  Scorsese does his improvisation formula, DeNiro does his improvisation formula, the technicians work their wonders, and Minelli does the best she can and actually comes out the shining star.    The music is the saving grace and makes buying the DVD perhaps worthwhile. It was often a true delight to watch Minnelli sing, and the recreations of the big bandsand the jazz culture were sometimes wonderful.  Tommy Dorsey's band at the beginning of the movie felt like the real McCoy, or at least, how one would fantasize it would've been on VJ Day.    Thus, it's the music that makes the DVD--and in essence, it is a musical, or at least should be appreciated as such, and luckily, with the DVD format, you can easily jump over the other stuff and go straight to the musical moments. As for Scorsese's ambitions with the derivative motifs and the conflict-riddled, deadening plot, I found Steve Martin's film \\"Pennies from Heaven\\"--made around the same time with a similar plot and similar ambitions--ten times more successful and poignant--and it's an unusual day when you find comparisons between a Scorsese film and a Steve Martin film, and then find the latter so much more impressive--not to mention a persistent, very strange, and desperate longing while watching this film for a smiling Robert Redford, or perhaps better yet, some loud and bloody Mafioso rough stuff.
B0007Y08II|5.0|I thought this movie was extremely creative and funny.  Yeah it's a satire of political and worldly ideas and events, but come on people sometimes you just have to let go and laugh about the goings on in the world!  If you go into this movie criticizing it and viewing it as propaganda, then you will be extremely offended and dissapointed.  It's a movie made to be hilarious satire and that's exactly what it is.  I laughed so hard I cried throughout the entire film!
B000929AJQ|5.0|Despite what a lot of these Nazi NIN fans say, this is a great album.  I think it's funny how so many people hated the Fragile because it was different but now the same idiots are complaining that With Teeth is a stripped down version of their older stuff.  Make up you mind.  Just take the album for what it's worth.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|I got hooked on Veronica Mars during the pilot, which I tuned to on a whim. I thought it was one of the best written hours of television I'd ever seen.  While some of the \\"mystery of the week\\" episodes were stronger than others, I was impressed that the threads of the over-arching story were kept going throughout the season.  The last 4 episodes of the season, where everything started to come together were gripping. I really loved this show and was so glad to see it renewed.  I hope it comes out on DVD!
6303369170|2.0|There are some lovely and funny moments in this movie (many of which have already been mentioned by other reviewers) but it doesn't all come together into an interesting or emotionally-satisfying story.<br /><br />All the performances are very good but the characters' interaction rarely comes across as credible. For instance, I had difficulty understanding how Axel, as a relatively stable young man, could fall in love with Elaine or Grace. In the case of Elaine, she was physically older but emotionally much younger than him and very selfish. While reasonably attractive for her age, she was certainly far less of a beauty than Axel would have been capable of attracting given his own appearance. I can't accept it was all about her looks and I can't believe it was about her character.<br /><br />Since the latter half of the movie is rooted in Axel's relationship and interactions with barely sane Elaine and morose and only slightly sane Grace, the two-dimensional nature of their characters undermine the end rather badly. The audience has to accept that the relationships between all characters are credible. I could not.<br /><br />I think that movies with surreal images and bizarre characters beg to be admired for their adventurousness and thinking outside the box. I don't have a problem with the lack of conventional storytelling nor the strange characters. I have a problem only with how incomprehensible the links between some of those characters were. I think Axel needed to be a lot more bizarre in order to relate credibly with the odder characters or the odder characters needed to have a very concrete appeal for him which the story made explicit.<br /><br />This isn't a bad movie. It simply isn't all that interesting to watch all the way through and rather disappointing at the end.
B0007OCG56|2.0|What an utter disappointment. From James L. Brooks, the man who made \\"Terms of Endearment\\", \\"Broadcast News\\", \\"As Good As It Gets\\" and of course, \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\", comes a dramedy that has two separate agendas that the filmmaker seems intent on integrating regardless of the resulting contrivances. The first is to show the plight of Mexican immigrants in their effort to realize economic betterment while concurrently maintaining their cultural identity. This part is worthy of screen treatment. The second is to show the underbelly of the liberal mindset and the seemingly rampant dysfunctional state of the family unit among the L.A. social elite. This part has been seriously misjudged.<br /><br />Let me tackle the problematic second part first. In an overly sincere mode, Adam Sandler portrays John Clasky, the hottest chef in a city where culinary celebrities are at the top of the heap. His professional life seems to be modeled after master chef Thomas Keller, who was exalted in the same way by food critics when he opened his \\"French Laundry\\" restaurant in Yountville (which is indeed fantastic). In fact, Keller appears in a pertinent extra on the making of the ideal late night sandwich, which includes the recipe as well. The challenge in accepting Sandler's performance is not his attempt to be taken seriously as Oscar-bait, but rather his apparently limited ability to convey the complexity underneath what seems to be the perfect man - understanding, compassionate (though too passive at key moments of conflict), a loving father. At this stage in his career, especially with his idiosyncratic tics (slurring his words, constant stooping, stumbling about), Sandler is simply not yet substantive enough an actor to pull off such a multi-dimensional role.<br /><br />But the real problem is the way Brooks conceives John's wife Deborah as a character. T&eacute;a Leoni has the unfortunate task of playing the aerobicized fishwife from hell, a former go-getter who was downsized out of her career as a commercial designer. Now Deborah is a horrifying mother who chokes the self-esteem out of her daughter (as much as it is inferred her mother did to her) and shamelessly pilfers the affections of her maid's daughter. She's a therapy-driven narcissist whose competitive impulses get in the way of any good intentions, and she's always apologizing for her actions, which Brooks hopes will endear her to us. It just doesn't work because Leoni, despite her obvious talent and beauty, is not likeable enough for us to care - Deborah is among the most exhausting, disreputable characters I have seen in a movie in ages (and that includes Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling in the documentary, \\"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room\\"). The combination of Sandler and Leoni nearly torpedoes the movie completely.<br /><br />This leaves us with the movie's first agenda item, the fearful assimilation of immigrant Latinos. Brooks has found a luminous actress in Paz Vega, a Penelope Cruz look-alike (imagine the Almod&oacute;var possibilities in their joint casting), as Flor, the woman who escapes Mexico with her daughter to eventually find work as the Clasky maid. Vega injects a nice quality into Flor that is at once unselfish and proud, as Flor exhibits true backbone to her employers. The character, however, is idealized at the expense of presenting a figure as complex as the Claskys, especially as the story veers into the inevitable though not terribly credible attraction that develops between Flor and John. In fact, her innate nobility provides the framework for the story as it is essentially a flashback described by her daughter Cristina in what must have been the world's longest application essay to Princeton. In the end, we are expected to believe that Flor is too virtuous to have any personal desires, though there is still something resolutely selfish about pulling her daughter out of the scholarship-funded private school.<br /><br />Shelbie Bruce is excellent as the adolescent Cristina, especially as she cross-translates John's and Flor's argument and in a moment of unfiltered anger near the end. Sarah Steele is equally fine as the Clasky's overweight daughter Bernie, alternating between smart-mouth comments and palpable sadness. And finally in a good role again, Cloris Leachman displays her considerable skill in playing Deborah's alcoholic though self-aware mother, Evelyn, who tosses the best line to her daughter: \\"Your low self-esteem is simple common sense, dear.\\" I only wish her character was fleshed out more to provide a better counterbalance to her awful daughter. Brooks should be commended for his high-mindedness here but docked for his hubris in having us accept these characters. The DVD has lots of extras, including enthusiastic audio commentary from Brooks with his editors Richard Marks and Tia Nolan and the addition of twelve deleted scenes again with the same trio providing comments. There is the brief Keller clip I mentioned, as well as an HBO First Look featurette that actually got me more excited about the movie than watching the movie itself.-translates John's and Flor's argument and in a moment of unfiltered anger near the end.

B0001I55OC|4.0|Sure the book is better. Of course the premise is fantastic. And almost every book-based film \\"could have been done better.\\" Just grab some popcorn, sit back, and be entertained. (Hey, it's a better Chrichton-to-film adaptation than Sphere!) <br /> <br />I saw this at a friends house and enjoyed it. Would I rave about it? No. But it intrigued me enough to want to read the book. So I did. Now that I've read the book, what do I think? I want to see the film again! <br /> <br />Don't try to rationalize scientific facts, just allow yourself to be entertained. I agree with an earlier reviewer that you will either love it or hate it. My family loved it.
0393316041|1.0|While the title seems to imply that the author was such a \\"free spirit\\" that he couldn't be shackled by others' limited capacity for life, what comes through between the lines at every turn is man who in fact was quite vane and wanted others to worship him.<br /><br />Now, as a professional physicist myself, I am fully aware of Feynman's contribution to physics. That's where he's outstanding and deserves respect. Outside of the realm of his craft, it's quite another story. In truth, the opinions and actions depicted in the book can best be described as smart-alecky and perhaps juvenile, not anything of depth. Nonetheless, over the years an industry of Feynman groupies (many of them physicists, of course) has formed. This book will be primarily of interest to these uncritical Feynman fans. If you think for yourself, on the other hand, I believe you will find the book disingenuous.
B000065PUE|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I've listened to \\"Doolittle\\" probably as much as anyone and love it. But it's not my favorite Pixies album, despite the fact that fans and critics have decided to term it their official \\"Best\\". There are some songs here like Mr. Grieves, Crackity Jones, and No. 13 Baby that I just don't think are that great, but I still listen to them. The main reason I can't say it's the best because of those 3 songs, which I am not a fan of. But IMO every single song on \\"Surfer Rosa\\" and \\"Bossanova\\" are great. I would rank this album 2nd after \\"Surfer Rosa\\".
0441172717|5.0|I am not a big fan of fiction books in general, but this series of books and Orson Scott Cards \\"Enders Game\\" series really are terrrific works that deserve to be read over and over again.  as a person who is interested in the outdoors and tracking animals in particular, I can say that this book and the books that follow it embody much of the spirit of tracking that my friends and I follow.  It is a captivating story of a royal family who moves to a new planet and it contains many insightful observations about humanity and life.  It is definitely not a kind of Star Wars fantasia book, it talks about the human struggle for power and our mentalities dealing with control.  It is intelligently written, as are the rest of the original books in the Dune series.  I highly recommend this book, as well as Enders Game and the other books in that series.  These books embody the greatness of science fiction for me, definitely.  Highly recommended.
B000067CPX|3.0|After reading the reviews of this album (finally, of course years after its release) I feel like another opinion must be heard.   <br /> <br />I have been a die hard peppers fan since the early 90's.  Yes i missed some of the late 80's (i was too young) but once i was hooked i was hooked. I have collected every album this band released and nearly every single.  I could not get enough of this band.   <br /> <br />Like most other pepper fans I can see the struggle that existed while creating One Hot Minute.  Then to have Californication come out was strange at first but then a breath of fresh air for this band.  So with my hopes up I waited for this album to be released...I hate to say this but I was disappointed. <br /> <br />By the Way missed the mark for me as a peppers fan and for many other peppers fans i know.  In other reviews it is said this album attracted a new crowd while keeping the old fans.  Well I haven't heard any old fan who think this was a great album especially not the bands best.  I mean as an old fan one album won't make me stop liking the band, so of course none of the old fans were lost.   <br /> <br />In another review someone mentioned this album will eventually become a classic like a REM or U2 album.  What? I listen to the peppers cause those bands just could never do it for me.  And again I can not name a single person who loved the peppers and wanted them to sound like U2.  They were a breed of their own and their energy/creativity is what seperated them from those entirely way too main stream groups.   <br /> <br />I just want to give some perspective on this album.  It is a good album for this band and maybe great compared to most the awful music being released these days (U2's Vertigo, my number one example) but not the best for the peppers.  The songs are catchy and are well written.  I just think the entire album is missing that old peppers spark.  Its kind of bland at times.  I know the band is changing musically and i completely respect that, so that is not the problem for me either.  But many reviewers feel \\"radio play\\" seems to be a factor.   <br /> <br />On another topic, I feel the musician who really shines on this album is John.  But if you really want to hear some great music by him please check out his solo realeases.  They may not be \\"pop\\" but they are great pieces.  Also don't think i am a John junky who only likes him.  Flea was the reason i started liking this band and is the main reason I still love this band.  <br /> <br />So wrapping up i just want to tell you that i am still a huge peppers fan (and always will be) but this album just isnt their best.  I am writing this in response to the other reviews here on amazon so not everyone who reads the reviews believes this album to be the best peppers you can buy for your money.  If you are interested in this band first buy Blood Sugar Sex Majik, then you will know what this band is about.  Plus, now that the band is back in the studio who knows what the future will bring.
B0000009RT|5.0|this album had a lot of influence on the Beatles \\"seargent Pepper\\" album, and it is quite apparant in the tunes here.  It is similar in a way, but obviously weirder and I would think much better than that overrated piece of work.  For one thing, the arrangements are extremely good for their time, and it is so good that it holds up extremely well today even after 40 some years.  Also, Zappa and his Mothers were self deprecating and brought a  lot of social commentary through their work, while making fun of it with strange and delightful arrangements that, in their words, \\"were designed to get 12 year olds to like the band.\\"  But you don't have to be 12 to appreciate the genius of this album.  I highly recommend it as a first purchase for those who are interested in Zappa, then get Hot Rats, Apostrophe, and Sheik Yerbouti for the best music he has to offer.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Not only is this album in 5.1 audio. but its advanced resolution via DVD-Audio (if you have the correct equipment, just like The Downward Spiral Dual Disc. The mix is incredible, not overwhelming but used in a very creative and expressive way. I highly recommend this dual disc if your into multichannel music. Music never sounded so good.<br /><br />If you dont care about the extras and dont mind  stagnent 2 channel audio, then just get the cd version, and stop putting down new formats that some of us see a future in (as long as it has 5.1 audio).
0385510454|4.0|Another exciting fast read from Mr. Grisham. The repeated emphasis on Italian food and the Italian language caught my interest more than the whole shenanigan of cool technology, US/international laws, politics, and government routines. Everything is explained quite nicely therefore one could just comfortably sit back and enjoy a tale of creativity and bravery. The ending is also straight forward. No surprises lurking in the corner. I kept expecting a jolting distress but none surfaced. The quick wrap-up of national and international security matters still baffles me. So I just keep reminding myself that is why the book is found in the fiction section.
B000068FWC|5.0|breakfast in america is one of the best aor albums ever made along with 4 from foreigner.this is one of my favourites and gets my highest possible recommendation.this album has great vocals,superb songwriting and great songs.anyone who hates this does not know anything  about good music.
0671004107|4.0|Dr. Sagan was an intelligent and creative man. I would have been more satisfied if he had left out the twist between daughter and father in the story but the symbolic of the situation bode well with the whole fiction. Having a woman as the President was a marvelous idea especially as it may come true in near future. His futuristic interpretation of scientific developments happening at the start of the millennium was clever. Maybe I am being biased because of Dr. Sagan's real life's achievements as a scientist. My favorite character is none other than the inventor with an attitude. All in all, although the story line is simple and predictable, Contact is still a skillful art at science fiction by a man with many commendable qualities. The day he passed away was truly a sad day for the science community.
B000002IG4|5.0|hello i must be gonig is one of the best albums by phil with his self titled album with genesis featruring the excellent mama and home by the sea.very highly recommended.get both the albums.
0446677450|1.0|This guy talks about how the the rich use corporations to buy stuff for themselves, like go on exotic holidays, mercedes benz, rolex watches, and the list goes on and on.... <br /> <br />This is insane! As an investor, I will never invest in a company whose managers/owners use the company for their own personal gain instead of operating with shareholders' interests in mind. How is a company ever going to grow in value when its managers use the company's fund for useless purchases that adds 0 value? I have no doubts a company with managers operating like that would be top in Warren Buffett's DO NOT INVEST list.  <br /> <br />Plus, most of the stuffs in the book are repetitive, it has this hypnotic effect on you believing that you are about to learn how to go about getting rich until the last page and then u realised he had been going around the bush! <br /> <br />In his other books along with this one, he goes about saying how stocks good form of investment and then starts critizing about stock lacking what real estates can produce and stuff. I mean tell that to the world's 2nd richest man who made his fortune purchasing common stocks. Good thing I borrowed this book and not buy it.  <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|abbey road was one of the best rock albums ever made along with sgt peppers.ignore the haters and their recommendations.abbey road is superb.get it.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|This is simply a fine album.  Reflects the wisdom of a 56 year old mega rock star who's seen it all, done it all and has been surrounded by the best; coupled with the young raw talent of today.  Unlike albums like Page/Plant, \\"Walking towards Clarksdale\\", where there is basically guitar/bass & drums, Plant has always, and continues to expand all horizons with jazz, techno, and instruments and beats from around the world.  All of the above factors come together on Mighty Rearranger.  What's different here, is Plant really speaks his mind about world affairs, as opposed to singing about lemons, shaking down nightgowns, and hearing the back door slam.  He started the rant about world issues in the last song in  Fate of Nations, but really ran with that baton with Mighty Rearranger.  In fact, \\"Freedom Fries\\" could have been written by Eddie Vedder or Bob Dylan. <br /> <br />The sound mix is incredible.  You are going to get a great soundstage effect on even a modest system.  Go to a high-end stereo store, and have them play \\"Somebody Knocking\\".  You feel like you are sitting across a 40 foot wide stage. <br /> <br />The whole album flows nicely.  You can hear from afar as background, as well as enjoy as a listening centerpiece.  Play it at a party!  Here are the songs, blow-by-blow: <br /> <br />Another Tribe blew me away.  I heard the album for the 1st time using headphones and I think I played this song 10 or 12 times before letting it roll to Shine it all around.  Opens with them banging on a Bendir(Moroccan drum) to the beat of the opening of Zep's Rock n Roll, and with acoustic guitars, clever techno effects, and a waltz-like orchestra-like effect, I was completely living outside my body.  Pure entertainment; mission accomplished!  Subtly, the bass-line seems like a sped up version of the line used during the bow-solo in the studio version of Dazed n Confused. <br /> <br />Shine it all around has a Bonham type of drum beat with a murky bass line.  A typical Plant-solo rocker.  A perfect single for the album, also the one most unlike the others. <br /> <br />Freedom Fries is a venomous attack on the situation in the middle east.  Musically, they're attacking the Bendir to an off-beat guitar.  As one reviewer put it, you'd need 3 legs to dance to this beat.  The song is sung in a similar fashion as Tall Cool One, or the song that opens the Manic Nirvana album. <br />   <br />Tin Pan Valley is Plant's introspection and statement about staying young in his profession.  Musically, like a cross between Pearl Jam's Faithfull (slow part) with The Who's keyboards from Eminence Front while Plant whispers along.  Then the song explodes in the climax like the Wanton Song on steroids.  Should silence all the people maintaining Robert's lost his voice. <br /> <br />All the Kings horses is a cross between Song to the Siren(Dreamland) and Going to Calif(Zep IV).   <br /> <br />The Enchanter is an album highlight.  Like a Pink Floyd song in many respects.  So many things going on here.  John Baggot's keys are a highlight.  When the solo hits, the speakers all but jump off the ground.  Seems like you hear something new during each listen.  In the outtro, play it loud and on good speakers.  The pounding bass is at such a low frequency, you hear things in the house/car shaking as opposed to hearing the actual bass. <br /> <br />Takamba is a rocker, plain and simple.  This attack on Blair has shades of Black Dog and Nobody's Fault but mine.  This song could have easily fit onto Zep's Presence album. <br /> <br />Dancing in Heaven is a soothing listen.  Similar to an acoustic version to Dancing Days. <br /> <br />Somebody Knocking is classic.  Using a myriad of Moroccan and Malaian instruments, mixed very well, has Plant singing his heart out like southern blues.  Again, a classic experience on very high-end audio equipment. <br /> <br />Let the Four winds blow is a rocker and features the rhythm section.  The drum/bass is punchy like a heavyweight on the large hanging bag.   <br /> <br />Mighty Rearranger reminds me of early, pre-Machine Head Deep Purple.  The beat reminds me of a kid skipping down the sidewalk and the guitar riff is vaguely reminiscent of How Many More Times(Zep 1).  Includes Honky-Tonk piano and Harmonica. <br /> <br />Brother Ray is about a minute of chanting; a small tribute to Ray Charles.  Then 16 seconds of silence pass, and the hidden track is a 7 minute techno remix of Shine it all around.  Not even vaguely detectable as originating from Shine it all around; but is fun nevertheless. <br /> <br />In summary, this is a great album for anyone into good rock n roll.  It reflects talent, wisdom and the openness to experiment with non traditional instruments, and incorporate them into good rock songs to make them better.  I strongly recommend this album.
0670033693|5.0|In Wyoming where the endless beauty of nature gives you the chance to let your spirit flow freely, things take time - and that is good.   Craig Johnson uses that time to paint a wonderful picture of the setting and to introduce us to a cast of characters any reader would dream of. Although they say it's a mystery - and they're right - there is also so much more. It's a tale about the people, their stories and the magical countryside.   True, other writers have written about this part of the world, but when Craig Johnson paints the story, you can feel the wind blow and even hear the snowflakes fall. Every detail that is mentioned helps you sense the atmosphere and lets you create your own picture in your head without ever being overdone.  It is not one of those fast who-dun-it mysteries that keep you chasing after the clues. But that doesn't mean you'll lose your patience - the storyline is much too good for that.   Sherif Walt Longmire of Absaroka County, together with his friend Henry Standing Bear and Deputy Victoria Moretti must solve the murder of Cody Pritchard, one of four high school boys who, a couple of years earlier had been convicted of brutally raping Melissa, a young Cheyenne girl. Walt never got over the horrible crime, but now it may be only him left standing between the other three boys and the bullets.  It's fiction at its best and it also happens to be a tremendously well written mystery you wouldn't want to end. And when it does you're probably going to start all over right away. A strong tale with great characters you won't forget.
B000929AJQ|4.0|On this new album, Trent Reznor seems to have made a special effort to integrate the sounds of the previous NIN studio albums, which in some ways were quite different from each other. Here we have a solid and well-constructed mix of the goth electronica of Pretty Hate Machine, the harsh soundstorm of The Downward Spiral (and the Broken EP) and the moody sonic explorations of The Fragile. This new integration has resulted in a pretty focused and no-nonsense album, but unfortunately there isn't much here that was worth waiting so many years for. About the only songs that show any sort of progression are \\"Love Is Not Enough\\" and \\"The Line Begins to Blur,\\" which are interesting expansions of classic NIN-isms. \\"The Collector\\" and \\"Sunspots\\" are winning examples of the type of rhythmic deathmarch that is Trent's bread and butter, while the low-tech new wave of \\"Only\\" adds some retro fun to the middle of the album.<br /><br />But otherwise, most of the songs here are either predictable or downright unsuccessful. Of the latter, the screaming anger of \\"You Know What You Are\\" just sounds self-righteous and indignant rather than introspective (the same problem that wrecked the awful \\"Starf***ers Inc.\\" on the last album), while the closing ballad \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" is dull and repetitive, lacking the mounting tension and drama of NIN's successful slow-burners of the past. Another problem is Trent's basic lack of progress in the lyrics department, with the exception of \\"Getting Smaller\\" in which he discusses his shrinking influence on cutting-edge music and how he has spawned an army of imitators. But sadly, Trent really isn't that far ahead of his imitators anymore. This album is definitely a solid and dependable exercise of the winning NIN formula, with no unpleasant surprises. Unfortunately, there aren't too many pleasant surprises either. [~doomsdayer520~]
0671015206|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This book, by Dr. Tom Stanley and Dr. Bill Danko, reveals the results of a survey that targeted wealthy people.  Stanley and Danko explain:<br /><br />\\"The research for [this book] is the most comprehensive ever conducted on who the wealthy are in America--and how they got that way.  Much of this research was developed from the most recent survey we conducted [from May 1995 through January 1996] that, in turn, was developed from studies we had conducted over the previous twenty years.  These studies included personal and focus group interviews with more than five hundred millionaires and surveys of more than eleven thousand high-net worth and/or high-income respondents.\\"<br /><br />What the authors discovered from their survey is found in this book.  Perhaps most helpful to readers is that they discovered \\"seven common denominators [or principles used by] those who successfully build wealth.\\"  Be aware that, and Stanley and Danko emphasize this, there are no sure principles that one can follow to become wealthy.  (In this book, the threshold level of being wealthy is having a net worth of $1 million or more.)  However, the principles outlined in this book will guarantee that you are on the right track to becoming wealthy.  The authors say this more eloquently:<br /><br />\\"If you are willing to make the necessary trade-offs of your time, energy, and consumption habits [then] you can begin building wealth and achieving financial independence.  [This book] will start you on this journey.\\"<br /><br />In this book, the reader studies the seven characteristics or principles of the wealthy.

B000929AJQ|1.0|When I first heard the title of this album was going to be \\"With Teeth\\", I thought this was going be an all out assault on my ears. <br />Hmmmm...Well it thats what it implys. Then I heard the single \\"The hand that feeds\\". I sat dumfounded listening to this uninspiring drivel, a blatant attempt to create a more commercial sound which although will probably sell well, will not be one you will be pulling out of your cd collection too often for a quick listen months/years from now. Its not that NIN fans expected or wanted a new \\"Downward Spiral\\", a crushing heavy angry album, but they expected a continuation of the experimentation and general weirdness(a good thing) of \\"The fragile\\". <br />This effort has done away with all of the inventivness of the previous effort and here we have a failed attempt at a pop album with come truly cheddar lyrics to boot. The songs are not played badly, the polished sound is ever so lovely and Trent sings like a demon but the songs are so boring and lame you`ll be shocked. <br />Trent pull the finger out, you have made your millions how about taking more of an artistic risk and create an album we all know your warped mind can create. <br />Oh yeah and we want this album next year not in a decade, you have one last chance. A NIN fan.
B000850IHW|5.0|It's difficult to pick one desert island Gentle Giant album, they all are unique, and all studio releases except \\"Giant for a Day\\" are must haves. With numerous time changes and intricate musical passages Giant is not for everybody and may challenge most listeners. But this challenge can have great rewards because the talent this band has is amazing... all musicians are proficient at multiple instruments, the songwriting skill is superb, and the tunes are timeless. For the novice to Gentle Giant, this CD would be a good starting point. <br />  <br />We begin with \\"Just the Same\\" a great upbeat-syncopated rocker... one of those tunes where the chorus sticks in your head and you sing it all day. \\"On Reflection\\" showcases great vocal work with a powerful instrumental jam at the end.  \\"Free Hand\\" is stunning! Great piano intro that turns into a full-out rocking tune slowed down briefly by a wonderful intricate middle section only to blast back into the awesome verse.  \\"Time to Kill\\" shows once again the power this band has... what a grooving tune, great bass line, great vocals, great interaction between musicians, great everything. \\"His Last Voyage\\" is the mellow track on the disc, similar to what can be heard on \\"Acquiring the Taste\\", complete with a very juicy guitar solo. \\"Talybont\\" is a short instrumental with sort of an Irish jig feel. \\"Mobile\\" begins beautifully with a violin and guitar intro only to transform into another great rocking tune. Finally, the bonus track is an unreleased version of \\"Just the Same\\". Good version, bad mix (kind of sounds squished/over-compressed). <br /> <br />The Free Hand remix sounds wonderful! After living with the atrociously muddy One Way Records mix for decades I can only say WOW... GREAT JOB! Unfortunately the CD does not give credit to the person who remixed this or from what source it was.  <br /> <br />It's a shame that Giant hasn't released a full-length studio project since the 80's, cause if they did, they would probably blow most bands out of the water. <br />
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I am not a Slipknot fan.  Until I started listening to this CD, I only liked one song, the everpopular \\"Wait and Bleed\\", mostly because it actually had a melody.  This album is actually musical, unlike former efforts which sounded like them banging on their instruments and getting lucky with a chord now and then.  Here, there IS musical talent.  The lyrics aren't all that great, although I do confess I like the Vermilion part 2 lyrics, at least in their musical context.  The guitar solos, which are suppposedly a new feature (I couldn't hear them on previous releases... but then, I couldn't hear much on previous releases, which is why I didn't buy them), are actually very good, again, particularly on Vermilion.  There is some actual potential for good music in the future from these guys, and the fact that they're branching out and trying new things... and actually pulling them off... is proof. <br /> <br />A word to some of the other reviewers... if you're still freaking out about how radio ready numetal is, and how you hate all numetal fans and music, and how Mushroomhead had the masks first... you know what, you're part of the problem.  You're continually doing the opposite of what is \\"cool\\" to do out of nothing more than principle, and neglecting the musical end of the MUSIC INDUSTRY just as badly as those who say things like \\"nu-metel rox!  buy all distrbed and linkin park and staind cd's cuz they are tru music!!!!!#(*#^$\\" <br /> <br />Just stop already.  Listen to what you like.  Try ACTUALLY being an individual, it's more fun not answering to people you don't agree with.  And stop bashing potential because you don't want bands that aren't \\"pure\\" metal to succeed.  So what if Slipknow is or isn't numetal?  The point is they're improving!
B0002X314C|5.0|This has to be one of the best R&B albums I've purchased in ages.  The talent of John Legend shines throughout this album.  His love ballads are cool and crisp, not overly syrupy, pop-sounding, or the borderline porn music most R&B is nowadays.  His voice talent is also matched by his piano skills.  If you ever get the chance, see him in concert.  He plays the piano while singing.  He's the male Alicia Keys in that respect!<br /><br />My only gripe with the CD is the rap appearances.  Snoop & Kanye West appear on 2 different tracks.  As a side note, I'm a fan of both rappers and hip hop in general, so it's not that I'm not \\"into rap\\".  I really dispise formula-driven commerical R&B (throwing in rapper_01 into the R&B song to expand the market), and Kanye & Snoop don't ruin the song, and the two songs don't sound like gimmicks, but I just felt their presence was unnecessary.<br /><br />It just seemed awkward to listen to John Legend and halfway through the album, Kanye comes in with a verse.  Then a couple songs later, Snoop makes an appearance. Kind of kills the mood a bit, but other than that, I have no complaints.  Overall, this is one of the best R&B CDs in a long time, and I'm listened to it countless times.<br /><br />It's no brainer pickup for anyone into R&B!
B00006879E|1.0|Anyone who has compared this sh#@*y band to Stevie Wonder needs to stop smoking the crack. Stevie Wonder has more talent in his little finger than this whole band. If you listen to some classic Stevie and still insist on making comparisons, then I feel for you. You obviously lack taste. To say that they suck is unfair to the word suck. I'll bet that, unless they have another hit single from this atrocity of an album, we have heard the last of Maroon 5. The high school kids who listen to them will graduate, pass them by and they'll be TSOL.  I hope they get while the gettin's good because pretty soon there won't be anything left for them to get. Goodbye and good riddance Maroon 5. You suck worse than any band that has ever sucked before.
B0007Z4S4C|1.0|This is total garbage,I don't know what these other reviewer's are listening too,this SUCKS BIG TIME.What happened to rock and roll? I've been a fan of plant\Zep since the early 70'S,And actually saw Zep in 77 at the Oakland stadium,CA JULY.So it really does hurt to have to be so brutally honest about this release,This is worse than \\"Dreamland\\" which was pretty bad in my opinion.Again my question is what happened to the Rock and Roll? That's what made you the legend you are Robert,get back to the Rock and Roll,you have such a great voice,don't waste it.
0141301155|5.0|this book is a very good book. after watching the movie and then reading the book, I found out that the book had much more detail than the movie. but the book was still very good. you could literally picture yourself in the book going threw all of the things charlie went throw. <br /> <br />
B0002DB52M|1.0|I think the title of this review says it all.  A waste of 3-hours.  This might work for a small theater production group but as a movie, forget it.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I am just frighteningly confused as to how this movie has been the #1 top seller on amazon.com for about an entire week!  This movie made a fairly low amount in theaters, so I have no clue how it has been #1 for so long, let alone at all.  Plus, it's beating out Seinfeld Season 4 for the #1 spot.  It just doesn't make any sense to me.  I don't have anything to say about the movie, though, so just ignore the number of stars I gave it.
B00000I01A|5.0|On this 1985 release,Survivor brings us another great hit BURNING HEART. Hey,EYE OOF THE TIGER is on this album also! Another big hit from this album is LIVING IN AMERICA by James Brown. \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic later used the music for his parody LIVING WITH A HERNIA on his 1986 album POLKA PARTY!. More great tracks performed by Sylvester's brother Frank Stallone. This album was released on the Scotti Brothers label,a division of CBS. Survivor was under contract with SB at the time of recording. Yankovic's first label,Rock 'N Roll,was a sub-division of SB. The other songs are great.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Quite simply, this is the best television show I have ever seen.  I fell in love with each one of these characters, and by the time I got to the last episode, I was heartbroken that there were no more.  Fortunately, this series is great for repeated viewings.  I find something new every time I watch it.   <br /> <br />I was excited to hear there is a movie coming out in September 2005, and can't wait to see how the story continues. <br /> <br />
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|It is amazing that at his age and what he has alreay accomplished in a decades old career that robert plant still is vital and making good, fresh music. His new album with his new band is just fine and his voice is fit as a fiddle. I saw him on letterman last nite and he looks great, tanned, trim and ready to rock.He understands his past and is willing to go on with his business and explore new terrain. I was very pleased the first time I heard the new album, it has been getting good reviews and I read a review or two of his recent shows and they were terrific. I applaud mr.plant for not resting on his laurels and his fans should be happy with his new album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Reading the other reviews and then seeing the number of episodes, one tends to feel a sense of disbelief. How could a half season of any show top all other TV? <br /> <br />The key, I believe, is density. In the half-season, Whedon crafts a world more rich and well-thought-out than series' others take 4 or 5 seasons to create. As a prior sci-fi fan I was stunned to find that after 14 episodes, I know Captain Mal Reynolds (and 8 other characters!) far, far better than I ever knew, for example, Captain Picard after hundreds of episodes. TV tends to be slow, repetitive and empty. We go to the theater and get the same amount of story in 2 hours that we usually get in a season of TV. <br /> <br />I never caught this show on TV. I never heard of it when it was on TV. A friend talked me into buying it after it was released on DVD and my husband and I have seen it 4 or 5 times through now. It's amazingly rewatchable. The density accounts for that, too. We find ourselves laughing at jokes we missed the first few times through (because we were laughing at others), and seeing details we never bothered to look for before. (The world is so real that you see brand names and similar references to THEIR pop-culture, and references to things that appear in LATER episodes!) <br /> <br />Watch it. You'll love it. Only one caveat: the first half of the first episode is *relatively* slow. Don't give up in that first hour and dismiss it as just more TV. It's worth it.
B00068NVI4|1.0|Since it's taking so long, and we have NO CLUE how they are editing this DVD, I have canceled the pre-order I've had for many, many months and will wait to read the \\"fan\\" reviews....then I'll decide whether to order or not...better to wait and be safe then get stuck with some cheesy DVD
B0002YLC24|4.0|\\"Before Sunset\\" is a great movie for those who are always refering back to old lovers or special connections from their past.  The interaction between the two main characters in Paris is moving and very realistic.  This may bore some who are looking for the entertaining escape from reality.  The interaction between the characters is exactly how people who haven't seen each other for a long period of time dance around subjects in order to find out news of thier past when they have spent it apart.  Both actors seem to capture the feelings and the emotions of being unsure what to say or how to act when you finally meet someone again after a long period of time.  Having not seen \\"Before Sunrise\\" before seeing this movie I feel that did not deminish the impact of viewing this moive nor detract from the entertainment factor of this movie.  I sugguest watching it with a close friend so you can have dialog over wine after the movie because it does bring out some universal themes of love, relationships and how over a period of passing years people can still have a basic and very moving connection with one another.
B0002DB50E|5.0|Over twenty years have passed since the release of this movie, and it still continues to amaze, confuse, disgust, and genuinely entertain viewers. David Cronenberg struck us with ideas that are still frightening to this day, and we love him for it. <br /> <br />This movie is based around the broadcast of a snuff show, during which people are tortured and murdered. When Max Renn, played by James Woods, tries to find the origin of this show, the reality of the movie becomes manipulated. Blurring real life with hallucinations, the viewer is taken through the exact feeling and horror that Max Renn experiences. <br /> <br />The people who have seen this movie are usually split into those who praise the genius and timelessness of it, and those who find it to be utter garbage. If you like your movies clean cut and wrapped up nice and neat, do not attempt to watch this. Though not as out there as a David Lynch movie, this will surely have you questioning what happened several times. However, if you want an experimental blend of science fiction and horror, do not pass by this DVD on your next trip to the video store.
B00005JMYI|4.0|There is hardly a moment in this movie that does not make you laugh till' it hurts. Will Ferrell is Ron Burgundy, the #1 Anchorman in San Diego in the 1970's. He and his (absolutely histerical) channel 4 news team rule the city until a woman (Christina Applegate) is thrown into the mix, and begins to destroy the male-dominated news world.   This is one of the best SNL alumni movies of all time. It's really the first movie that allows Will Ferrell to let loose and show just how funny and talented he is. The entire rest of the cast, really stepped up to the plate to keep up with Will Ferrell, and was a perfect complment to the central figure Ron Burgandy.   Very little of the humor in this movie is crude, most of it relies on the talent of the cast to make you laugh. Anyone who has seen the movie would agree that the street fight between all of the city news teams, was one of the beat parts of the movie.  I hope that popualrity for this movie grows in the years to come. Anyone who has not seen this movie is really missing a side-splitting classic.
0553212478|3.0|Does anyone remember that television show \\"Kablam\\"? There was a sub-program on it called \\"Prometheus and Bob,\\" where Prometheus was an alien and Bob was a caveman. Bob was always doing stupid things with the technology that Prometheus brought for him. Well, another name for \\"Frankenstein\\" was \\"The Modern Prometheus.\\" However, a more appropriate name for \\"Frankenstein\\" would be \\"The Modern Bob\\" because this book did a horrible job of portraying the nightmarish scenes that could have put the book at its full potential. In laymen's terms, it did stupid things with the abilities of Mary Shelley. If anyone is looking for a book to read, he or she would be better off reading \\"The Great Gatsby\\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald or \\"Rebecca\\" by Daphne Du Maurier. Please avoid wasting your time by reading \\"Frankenstein\\"... or should I say \\"The Modern Bob\\"?
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie has no expolsions, sex, or anything that will blow you out of your seat. Instead, from start to finish, it just makes you laugh with it's subtle, situational humor.   In short, it's a story about life in \\"cow town\\", Idaho. Napoleon Dynamite is a geeky teenager who is on the outside of the social circle, and is perfectlt happy there. He and his new friend Pedro deal with the issues of their High School life including girls, acceptance, family, and everything in between. With Napoleon's Uncle Rico thrown in, as well as some of the other characters like Rex Kwon Do and Pedro's cousins with the \\"sweet hookups\\", this movie is a classic that makes you laugh all the way through. I was not only pleasantly supprised by this movie, I bought it as soon as it was available, and have seen it countless times since.  I've heard a lot of people simply state that they think the movie is just \\"wierd\\" or \\"boring\\". The humor in this movie is abundant, but it might be a bit dry for some tastes. To me, there is nothing boring about this film. It's a classic that I will treasure forever. I hope that if you have not seen it already, you will watch it once to give it a chance.....it's more than worth it.
B0002IU988|4.0|I purchased this album because I sort of like Creed and I was pleasntly shocked. It is a much better then any of Creed's albums their style is a lot different then Creed's. It's a little bit harder. Songs like \\"Metalingus\\", \\"Broken Wings\\", are my favorite. Overall a good effort but not amazing.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|This dvd is a must have for any AC/DC fan, it is packed with about 2 hours of great performances, and has a bit of commentary from Angus and Malcolm Young.  Some of the best performances on the dvd include:  Thunderstruck, MoneyTalks, High Voltage, Whole Lotta Rosie, You Shook Me All Night Long, Highway To Hell and For Those About To Rock (We Salute You).  Once you buy this dvd, you'll be glad you did, it's worth every penny.
0140277447|4.0|An amazing document of Japanese war crimes in China. Iris Chang delivers a gripping account of this little known holocaust. I particularly respected her explanation of the Japanese consciousness of the period, and her forgiving compassion towards Japanese people. This reminded me that all peoples are capable of such error - depending on the cultural and political climate of the times, etc - and not just the Japanese themselves.<br /><br />Also, a Nazi who was a hero! Another testament that the goodness of people resides within them, and is not something to be judged based only on the group they belong to.<br /><br />This is a book for the whole world to read. It is for Japanese for obvious reasons: that they may acknowledge their past. It is for Chinese for not so obvious reasons: that they may learn to understand and forgive (and maybe even eventually acknowledge their own past - as they would demand of Japanese people.) It is for us all in the hope that soon we will each actively seek to stop such things from happening in the world today (what about D.R Congo?) and from ever happening again. Still, utopian dreams aside, Iris Chang also gives a fascinating and detailed contrast over the way we treated Germany and Japan after the war. For all the open contradictions and political hypocrisy, this book is truly food for thought. 'The Rape of Nanking' is a thorough must-read.
068817776X|5.0|I loved this book! Edith Hahn Beer does a spectacular job of humanizing th Holocaust making us feel everything that she went through as if we were right there next to her. This isn't the Diary of Anne Frank...It's better!
B00003003R|5.0|This is the Greatest Hits CD that the true fans have been waiting for.  Although I must admit one of my favorites, Civil War, did not make the cut, nearly every other one is here.  Guns n Roses was the ultimate live experience and so to truly appreciate them, one must hear them in their natural environment on the stage.  This is something this 2-disc collection captures very well.  Hold out for hope on Chinese Democracy, but true fans should pick this one up in the meantime.  Come on, Axl, show us one last time you still have what it takes to make the world stop, put down what they are doing, and listen to what you have to say.
B0002X314C|4.0|First off I love this disc.  Listen to it more than any other released so far this year. And I normally don't give a lot of weight to lyrics when reviewing an album.  I'll take James Brown's \\"I Feel Good\\" over any of Jim Morrison's \\"poetry\\" any day.  Nonetheless, when I heard Kanye West's rap in the middle of \\"Number One\\", I cringed with embarassment.  It can't be meant to be taken seriously (can it?), but it's too stupid to be funny either.  Did he really just pledge his love to the woman he had been unfaithful to by telling her his penis told him she was his favorite????? <br /> <br />That aside, I will still buy Legend's next album before hearing a single track.  He is an immensely talented musician with a great soulful voice.  The arrangements are outstanding as well.  It is also nice to hear a new soul singer who can sing melisma-free. I just hope he decides to take a stand and deny his organ's future requests to pen any of his lyrics.
B00006IR5S|5.0|John Williams does it again.  Another brilliant score to accompany these wonderful movies.  His musical depiction of Gilderoy Lockhart is priceless...so simple, yet very descriptive (he uses a very simple, snooty tune with strings and harpsichord).  I can't say it's my favorite of the series, but nonetheless a great score.
B00003CXIY|5.0|A word of warning before I start my review: the best time to watch \\"Road Trip\\" is during your colonoscopy where you can't eat for three days. Otherwise, this film will make you sick with all of its gross out gags. But herein liese the film's charm.<br /><br />And now on to the review. \\"Road Trip\\" tells the story of Josh (Breckin Myer) is a college dude who abandons his studies but has remained faithful to his girlfriend (Rachel Blanchard). That is, until one night, his friend (Sean William Scott, essentially reprising his role as Stifler from \\"American Pie\\" as a jerk who makes fun of virgins) invites him to a party. This is where he meets Beth (Amy Smart). That night, they make a sex tape. However, Josh feels bad and tells his friend Barry Manilow (Tom Green) to mail his love message to his real girlfriend to her dorm in Austin. However, he sends the sex tape. Josh and company go on a road trip to retrieve the sex tape and save his relationship. The laughs in this film are fast and furious, though as I said might make you queasy (like when Horatio Sanz shoves french toast in his butt and feeds it to one of Josh's friends).<br /><br />My advice: buy this hysterical film. You'll laugh and laugh.
B00020HEG6|5.0|An important why I like John Williams' music so much is for its distinctive quality.  When I hear a John Williams score, I know it could not have been composed by anyone else.  It's highly colorful like Stravinsky, melodious as a Tchaikovsky score, and share many of the same traits one would find in Wagner (leitmotif).  His Harry Potter scores share all of these qualities.  Since, at its completion, this will be a 7 part saga, many of the Wagnerian qualities found in his \\"Ring\\" Cycle cn be applied here.  The melodies are so memorable and original, and yet they just seem to roll of the tongue like any other tune. <br /> <br />I have a particular affinity for the Harry Potter scores...I think its among his most brilliant music.  The Prisoner of Azkaban is no exception...he brings the color and melody from the previous movies to life here, but is also able to capture the dark nature of the movie without making the music itself dark, as well.  Of particular note is his scoring for the scenes with the dementors...truly chilling, even if you hear it in the concert hall without knowledge of the books or movies. <br /> <br />As with the previous to soundtracks, this is definitely a score to add to your collection...looking forward to the next installment.
B0008ISM40|5.0|This is the first NIN album that I ever really listened to. I would download the other ones from people at my school and not really listen to them. but this album is awesome. Almost every track is kickass. I'd recommend it to anyone who is new to NIN like me or anyone who liked them before like anyone else.
B0008ISM40|2.0|Nine Inch Nails (NIN) is one of my top favorite bands of all time. The first three songs I heard from them back in 1996 when I started listening to music was \\"Head Like a Hole,\\" \\"Terrible Lie,\\" and \\"Closer.\\" Those are what got me into NIN, and I loved both CDs those songs came from, \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral.\\" \\"Downward Spiral\\" also had other outstanding tracks, \\"March of the Pigs,\\" \\"Ruiner,\\" and \\"Heresy.\\"     Then in 2000, Trent Reznor had a double disc album titled \\"The Fragile,\\" which was a phenomenal release. \\"The Fragile\\" contained some of NIN's greatest songs, such as the hard and fast music in \\"Starf***ers, Inc.,\\" and \\"Somewhat Damaged,\\" to the instrumental \\"Pilgrimage,\\" through \\"I'm Looking Forward To Joining You, Finally,\\" which sounds like something out of a Native American rain dance.     After that, Trent seemed to go back into remixville without making anything really new.     \\"With Teeth\\" is the first NIN album in six years, which I, along with every other NIN fan, had been waiting for. Unfortunately, \\"With Teeth\\" is a major disappointment to both the fans and to Trent as I want to know what he was doing during these past six years.     First off, a lot of the songs sound like Trent was just bored when he was singing them, which is highly noticeable in \\"Only\\" and \\"All the Love in the World.\\" \\"All the Love in the World\\" has some potential to it, but the song takes about 3-4 minutes to do so, and then it seems to end abruptly.     \\"The Hand that Feeds,\\" is the first single, and took me about ten hearings before I started to like it, but it is still not the greatest song in the world. Even worse though, it ends up being one of the harder sounding tunes on the entire album. Whether or not that is a good thing has to be determined by the individual listening to this CD, but for me, it is a major let down as Trent can do better than this.     The entire album is not a total loss, as \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same, \\"Sunspots,\\" \\"You Know What You Are,\\" and \\"With Teeth\\" are decent songs, but could be much better. \\"With Teeth\\" does bring back memories of \\"The Fragile's\\" \\"I'm Looking Forward To Joining You, Finally\\" though, so that was enjoyable.     As if things were not bad enough on this album, the last three songs are almost unbearable to listen to. \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" is just a dreadful song that has no redeeming quality in it, while \\"Beside You in Time\\" has just as much potential as the ones I mentioned above, but goes by without reaching it. \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" is filled with piano playing most of the song, but there is just something about it that makes it an unpleasant experience.     Finally, the remaining tracks I have yet to mention (\\"The Collector,\\" \\"Love is Not Enough,\\" and \\"Getting Smaller\\"), are so disappointing to the point that the song is forgettable the moment it ends. It feels as if there was no song at all.     As mentioned before, for being the first real NIN album in six years, it was a real disappointment. It just feels like Trent needed to get a new CD out to please the fans with new material regardless of how trashy they were.     Also, as if disappointment with the music was not enough, the cover art is bland because there is nothing exciting shown, and there is no booklet with lyrics in it.     One last item since I own the Dual Disc version. The newspapers in my area made it sound like it was a CD that came with a DVD that contained all of NIN's music videos sans Marilyn Manson's and Korn's \\"Best of\\" albums. Instead, it is just a double sided disc with one side featuring the music, while the other side, a DVD, contains the same bland music and the video to \\"The Hand that Feeds.\\"    Trent, if you happen to read this (doubtful), I hope your next album has more passion put into it than this one.     I give it 2/5 stars, and that is just because it is NIN.
B000096I9G|5.0|As a die hard Cure fan, I can't believe what I'm reading.  People claiming this work does not compare with classic cure songs like `Friday I'm in Love'???  Most \\"reviewers\\" seem to cite `Disintegration' as The Cure's high point, and even that bothers me.  The Cure was at their peak when the released most of their albums.  What made them great was that they changed their flavor, but remained true to what they really were.  `Disintegration' marked another change in their style which was far from my favorite.  I would say `Faith' and `Pornography' are their strongest works, but all Cure albums have the same experimental element with retention of certain fundamentals which can only be defined as `The Cure'.   <br /> <br />The new album is no exception.  I would have to say they self-titled the album as a gentle reminder to the many who have borrowed from Cure works that borrowing is fine but stealing is not.  There is only room for one Cure, and Mega Smith (that's a South Park reference) will make sure it stays that way by making imitation impossible.  Each song represents a tour of past, present and future(?) of their illustrious catalog. <br /> <br />I would say the new album is great.  You've listened to them over 20 years; you can risk ten bucks on them, can't you?  If you have never listened to The Cure before (I doubt you would be reading this let alone be exposed to this album if that was the case,) this might not be the best starting point.  Try `Three Imaginary Boys', `Faith' or `Pornography', then go back for this one.  And if your favorite Cure song is `Friday I'm in Love', do Robert, Simon and the boys a favor and don't discourage others from enjoying one of the last examples of true musical pop-art <br />
B000024D4R|5.0|That may sound bizarre, but it's the only way I know how to describe this album.  A dissapointment for many fans following Dark Side and Wish you were Here, Animals is proof that Pink Floyd wouldn't sell out. This album is pretty much all Waters influenced, as any Floyd fan can pick up right away.  But Gilmour can be heard almost every step of the way, and the combination is as always fantastic. Every track here is incredible, especially Dogs and Sheep.  The intro and outro of Pigs on the Wing are fantastic.  Overall Animals is an aquired taste, but once you get that taste in your mouth, there's nothing quite like it.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|I just can't get over how much I love this show. I just got done watching the season finale and i am so bummed cause I can't wait till the second season. I've watched from the first episode on and every show just amazes me! Who would have thought that upn would make such a great show! I can't wait till the first season comes out which should be in September according to the creators website.
B000268QB2|5.0|I am not one to often buy music by new artists. I find most new music today to be disappointing. I guarantee - this album will not disappoint! The songs are easy to listen to. I was in love with most of the songs by the second or third time I listened to this album. I can't wait to see what they come out with next!    I can't believe the price for this album either- very affordable.
B0007GFFVQ|4.0|Not Enos best work. The album sounds fragmented but it is still very enjoyable. I would recommend another green world or music for airports over this one.
B000021YQV|2.0|I guess it isn't really fair of me to slag this group off completely, as I have never listened to one of their albums in its entirety (I can barely bring myself to sit through half a song, let alone half an hour). So they get two stars instead of one. <br />I just don't like anything about this band. The music itself is monotonous, and the frontman's voice irritates me. As for the hard-hitting political lyrics, I could probably write better: <br /> <br />\\"The government is bad.\\" <br />\\"They lie.\\" <br />\\"Arrrgh.\\" <br /> <br />Pass this up if you have any respect for your eardrums.
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity... Perfectly packaged testosterone of intelligent design. Have another Red-Bull & Vodka and blast off- This is definitely one for the boys. Melodies and chords are tightly compressed into sounds that transport. Take the best of Candle Box, Tool, Metallica, throw in some hard Pearl Jam, well timed primordal screams and whispers, add whimsical nursery ryhme lyrics and you've got it. This album is destined as a hard edged neo-classic!

0671027344|5.0|I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower when my friend bought it for my birthday.  I read the entire book in one sitting, and was never the same again.  This emotionally raw and brutally honest book has made such a difference in my life.  It is the story of 15 year old Charlie, an adolescent dealing with the highs and lows of his life.  He is a shy yet brilliant young man with an amazing capacity for affection and compassion.  I cried and laughed through the entire story.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  It is a little graphic though, so I wouldn't recommend children to read it.  Teenagers deinitely, adults most certainly!  Parents- do you want to really know what on earth is going on with your teens?  This will help you understand the horror that can be adolescence.  The writing is brilliantly blunt and simple, creating something that is so real and familiar to the reader.  I loved this book, and find myself reading over and over again.  It's definitely worth your time!
0553573403|5.0|This is the real deal, folks. The best the fantasy genre has to offer today -- and maybe ever. A lot has been made of this series already, but I wanted to add my voice to the legions of others who have expressed their admiration for what the author has done.<br /><br />Too many fantasies, in my opinion, tend to focus on a single hero, a protagonist born to fulfill some kind of great prophecy against evil. While I enjoy those types of stories as well as the next guy, this one provides a refreshing change. Rather than one hero, we have many. Rather than one \\"dark lord\\", we again have many. This is not a farm-boy-conquers-the-world epic, but a battle royale between the various nations of the kingdoms of Westeros, a sort of last-man standing takes the prize.<br /><br />Characters in Martin's world are not black or white, but varying shades of gray. A character you believe to be a villain will prove noble later on. A character you believe to be noble will do something despicable. It can be frustrating, at times, because you don't know whether to love a character or hate them, but that's how the real world works.<br /><br />And speaking of which, this is a REAL world. We know what the characters eat -- sometimes in exhausting detail. We know what they wear -- and seldom is it the same thing twice. In the hands of a less-skilled writer, such details might fast become cumbersome and slow the pace of the story. But not Martin. Martin weaves it all together so that the reading is effortless.<br /><br />I'm sure someone out there has said that Martin is no Tolkien. Seems every fantasy writer today is saddled with that burden. So be it. Martin, in my opinion, has lifted the genre to heights that Tolkien never even imagined. His world is every bit as detailed, but his characters and events much more authentic (and the language much easier to read). You won't see one man take down 100 raving orcs, because, quite simply, it isn't realistic. And while \\"realistic fantasy\\" may seem an oxymoron, I don't know of a better way to describe this author's work.<br /><br />If you're one of the few who hasn't yet sampled Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", I urge you to do so. Fresh and exciting, filled with both action and intrigue, it will keep you guessing, and waiting ravenously like so many others for the latest installment.y seem an oxymoron, I don't know of a better way to describe this author's work. <br /> <br />If you're one of the few who hasn't yet sampled Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", I urge you to do so.

0385338082|4.0|There's one word that I kept using to sum up this book: cute. It's not especially challenging (same old story line about low level assistant with a guy she should love but somehow falls short, feels like she's not living up to family expectations, etc.), but Kinsella's writing is amusing and the characters are likeable. Although the character thought and acted a little a little young for my taste, she was enjoyable. And Kinsella definitely knows how to spin a fun story.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Cold Roses is an exceptional album for his fan base.  The eighteen tracks can be a little overwhelming at first, but there are some amazing songs on both discs.  The first four songs on disc one are great crashing into \\"beautiful sorta\\" the lone rocking oddity on the album.  \\"When Will You Come Back Home?\\" is the perfect answer to Love Is Hell's \\"This House is Not for Sale.\\" A bit of advice for those that have purchased the album, I took my two discs and burned them on to one 18 track CD.  That is much better for driving around instead of shuffling two discs all the time.<br /><br />The overall feel of Cold Roses falls in between the Love is Hell EPs and Heartbreaker.  This should make Ryan Adams fans happy.  The only drawback is the length of the record.  With so many songs it will be difficult for new fans to get into the album, although as prolific as Adams is how can anyone blame him?  Ryan Adams is scheduled to release two more albums by the end of the year, but it is difficult to imagine him topping Cold Roses.  2005 promises to be the year Adams establishes himself as the most prolific songwriter in America; something his fans already knew.
B0007GAERG|4.0|I have to admit mariah's had a really successful career as the best-selling female artist of all time, has had 16 #1 hits (\\"We belong together-the biggest hit of the year)her new album has sold 3 million 2 date. but before there were lows, her movie and album of the same title both bombed in 2001, had a very stressful breakdown, then the year later after being signed to island def jam tried to have a comeback album with \\"Charmbracelet\\", that failed to generate any buzz and \\"through the rain\\" peaked at #81, and the other singles didn't do that well either. On, that album, i liked the songs but i wished she woulda sang out more like she did on mimi. but anyways now onto teom: 2005-this was her success of the year, a really good comeback for mariah, but i have to wonder why on earth is there so many freakin re-release editions of teom? it's really unnecessary. if u've paid almost 20$ for the original, don't bother going out and buying another, and another, and another freakin other. my god! i think her label just wants 2 cash in for the success. i think all of the tracks on the original emancipation are great, mariah's voice is back, stronger,(even though i think it's alittle strained-she should've stopped releasing cd's so much) but even though there are a couple of good tracks like: \\"don't 4get about us\\". i just don't get y we have 2 go out n buy so many freakin re-releases with the same ol features with new ones. phew! i'm done as u can see i'm just alil aggravated but overall, mariah's my idol, she's had a good comeback, and 2 u haters f off!
B0002858YS|3.0|Damn this album is derivative!  Is it good music?  Yeah, but if you lived through the 80's, you've been here.  If you didn't live through the 80's (and you're not just focused on the fact that the frontman is pretty and has a great publicist) buy The Cure's Singles instead.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson has produced and helped brew up a masterpiece.    William Wallace is a Scottish commoner, a bit on the rowdy, adventurous side, but for the most part normal.     To summarize this epic in a sentence or two, Wallace fights for the freedom of Scotland, and slightly because of a rage triggered by the murder of his beloved, Murron. After countless attacks and a couple of battles, Wallace's life comes to an end.    This is a phenomenal movie, though it has very discreet imperfections (which all movies have), it is thought-provoking and well beyond poignant. I must warn you that this film might have you sobbing, it had me doing so.     Don't expect a fairytale ending, and don't expect everyone to be happy. I grant you, yes, there is a lot of fighting, I, not one to be affected by gore, did have to shield my eyes from the slaughtering, but the battle seens are worth the movie.    This is not an intellectual film, and it is not an action flick. It's a work of art.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Who would of thought that last seasons oc could of been topped, but Mark Schwarzer and the crew have just went and done it with the second series. This series develpos alot more and there is alot more characters introduced (which is one of the best parts)and there is alot more of the oc usual with sex, drugs and parties newport style. I am rating this programme 5 stars because simply it is the best programme on tv and will be for years to come.
B000669GAI|5.0|This album is a great addition to anyones collection. It charts the development of a great band from early nineties to present day. The collection contains so many varying types of songs that it is hard not to like at least some of them. The album is split into two sides namely an upside and a downside. the upside contains many of the smash hit songs i.e. (Jeremy, alive , once, go) from the albums ten and Vs  as well as songs from latter albums (Vitalogy, No code, Yield, Binuaral and Riot act). the songs on upside are invariably of a higher tempo and would appeal to the  fans of the early albums.  the second side of the album is jam packed of more mellow songs but one or two of them could have been put on the upside .ie. given to fly, breath etc. The inclusion of the all-time classic song ''black'' makes this disc a must even for the casual listener. Also included on this disc is  previously unreleased song '' man of the hour and fan favourite ''' yellow ledbetter''  After listening to this album you are struck by how talented this band really are. One possible gripe is that the latter albums are not as represented as much as say ten, Vs. Some would argue that this is correct i wouldnt. Some of pearl jam best and most under rated work has been done since.  hopefully there is more to come.

B00003CWRX|4.0|Quick camera movements and hushed dialog heighten the claustrophobia and paranoia faced by Russel Crowe, the putative hero of \\"The Insider\\". When the story starts, Wigand is a well-paid research scientist for a cigarette manufacturer. Wigand's manicured home, family and life mirror his life, but when the flick opens, we have the sense that it's already over for him.  He's clearly had enough of the cigarette industry, but knows he could lose a severance package negotiated to keep him silent about the workings of his ex-employer's marketing tactics. Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman, a producer for 60 Minutes proves, at about the same time, that he's not afraid to put his personal safety on the line for the story. Christopher Plummer is a surprisingly effective Mike Wallace.  In the \\"Insider\\", they come together in a sort of manipulative morality tale about corporate greed and nicotine.  Though there's no secret about the health risks of chain smoking, Wigand threatens to expose the industry's attempts to make cigarettes more addictive.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Wigand's attempts to expose his former employers - through both legal action and through an expose on \\"60 Minutes\\" runs into obstruction by the industry.  Losing his severance package and soon his pretty family, Wigand's life is soon turned upside down.  On Bergman's end, his efforts to air Wigand's expose are morphed from a complex story involving well-meaning journalists rendered powerless by questionable law - into a simpler story of noble journalist Davids against the might of corporate Goliaths (the flick shamelessly touts \\"corporate\\" as if it were a profane word, as in \\"did CBS News cave in to CBS Corporate?\\").  Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt, who probably had no power to resist CBS's initial ban against the Wigand story, are now seen as craven corporate lackeys (Wallace, who is fearless in the face of an Hizbollah bigwig early in the movie, cowers at the thought that he may be reduced to doing NPR if he disobeys orders).  Played by Pacino, Bergman is the hero here (the script seems to credit him for leaking the banned story to the print media, even though WSJ is credited with doing it themselves), while Wigand is well meaning to the point of martyrdom.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this account of dirty tricks and cigarette makers is undone by its own murky paranoia - just how does \\"Big Tobacco\\" manage to hold onto their political power the way nicotine holds onto smokers? Least convincing is speed with which the editorial staff at \\"60 Minutes\\" caves into corporate pressure to dump the story. It's never really explained how guys who regularly face-off against government bureaucrats, corporate honchos and terrorist leaders in the darkest corners of the new century crumble like a house of cards before big tobacco. There's a huge moral dilemma that never makes it to the story.  <br />  <br />For all its murkiness, the film remains evocative and irresistible - great scenes, like Crowe's epiphany in a hotel room, and Pacino's giving a hotel attendant long-distance instruction in the art of talking like Al Pacino. Much of the dialog sounds like a collection of newspaper blurbs, but the story's focus and some unforgettable acting make the insider a story you just can't get yourself out of.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Having been a huge fan of Plant's since Zep I, both with his  music and his undeniable charm and personality, I greet every release with much anticipation.  I was not, to be honest, knocked out by \\"Dreamland\\", but I figure I owe this guy...sooo...this is very very good.  Its quite easy for so called fans to demand that Robert deliver Black Dog Part 10....but thats not what he has ever been about.  This is where he is at now....and what \\"Dreamland\\", for me lacked, Mighty Rearranger brings it back tenfold.  I enjoy this as much as \\"Now and Zen\\", my favorite solo work of his.  The band is very good, the production is very clean and clear and Robert is in fine voice.  I welcome his return, and look forward to hearing these songs fleshed out live.  Favorite tracks \\"Shine It All Around\\", \\"The Enchanter\\", \\"Takamba\\" and \\"Dancing in Heaven\\".  Since my purchase , it hasn't left my player.
0790730960|5.0|Tim Burton's second Batman instalment is a wickedly dark, atmospheric masterpiece that somehow draws you in from the first scene.  Michael Keaton's back as the caped crusader.  There's an edginess about him his time, though.  <br /> <br />By now, we're all aware of the characters and the plot.  Ozwald Cobblepot's aristocratic parents are so repulsed by their disfigured offspring that they dispose of him down the sewer, and the result is a grotesque and hideous Penguin, played to perfection by Danny DeVito.  Who could have portrayed Penguin better than him? <br /> <br />There were a few raised eyebrows over the choice of actress for Catwoman, and Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't the only contender for the slinky part.  The gorgeous Jody Watley (ex-Shalamar singer) was rumoured to be in the running to play the character made famous by the legendary Eartha Kitt.  In the end, the producers decided to play it safe with an established Hollywood actress.   <br /> <br />Pfeiffer plays a wonderfully complex character.  You have the exploited secretary (Selina) who's clumsy, vulnerable yet ambitious, and this is fused with a mysterious Catwoman, all clad in leather.  Oh, and let's not forget Christoper Walken's Max Shreck who has a sinister plan to drain Gotham City of its energy supply. <br /> <br />What about a storyline?  Who cares about a story line!  Batman Returns is a visual feast that should have been showered with Academy Awards.  There's a hypnotic gothic madness to it all that shows off Burton's creative genius to the max.  <br /> <br />Batman Returns is, in my opinion, the best Batman movie of all.   <br />   <br /> <br />

630529142X|3.0|To start, the film was pretty stupid. It really doesn't have any substance, and the story is slow and stupid. <br />That said, it is a pretty good film. \\"WHAT?\\" You say. I am a huge Adam Sandler fan, and I think his acting, and insane humor saved this film, and made it watchable.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just wanted to add my praise to the huge list already assembled.  This show is possibly the best tv ever, and I will never understand why it was cancelled.  When my husband and I watched it through for the first time, that's what we kept asking each other.  \\"Why in the heck was this cancelled?\\"  Although I think I might have an answer.  Fear.   This show is smart, funny and tragic at the same time, and full of subtleties of detail that could be missed in a single watching.  And as we all know, television executives assume we are all stupid, dull, and don't want comedy mixed in with our drama.  Well, guess what.  Some of us do.  A great many of us, if these reviews are any indication.  The acting is superior for television, the writing is witty and full of character-specific detail, and the effects are jaw dropping.   <br /> <br />So, if you love science fiction, love action, love good characters, or just plain love to be entertained, you can't go wrong here.
B0007OCG56|4.0|First of all, Spanglish not a manic, goofy, insane comedy like Adam Sandler usually pulls out.  <br />It is actually a Romantic Comedy. <br />It is a chick flick in some ways, but actually enjoyable for most guys too, \\"unless you are on a Vin Diesel kick.\\" <br />A pretty good film with good morals and some fun moments.
B000002JEV|4.0|I am not a die-hard Led Zeppelin fan.  But I have come to have enormous respect for the quartet of Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham.  I have come to realize that the efforts of a great work ethic have produced some of the stuff that legends are made of - and Led Zep takes the cake.   At the same time, I have always been a fan of the music that has been a part of the \\"BBC Archives\\".   These archives contain legendary live recordings, exclusive studio sets, and documentaries that are a must for any music fan.   Since there is a well-known shortage of official \\"live\\" albums by Led Zeppelin, when I found out that \\"Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions\\" was being made available, I was most interested in this collection.    While I don't consider a lot of the material, Led Zeppelin's \\"best\\" material - I just continue to have more and more respect for what was one of the all-time great bands. <br /> <br />When I review a live album, I usually prefer the album to basically be a full recoding of a concert.   I normally am not one for edited concerts or live compilations.   However, with \\"Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions\\", I felt I had to adjust my thinking.   This compilation is attempting to surface material that was broadcast back from 1969 through 1971 - and has basically been \\"lost\\" (except for those who had bootleg recordings).    The important thing to note is that the emphasis of the material is going to be from Led Zeppelin's first four albums - or what I term \\"the early days\\".   The collection includes material that were broadcast on three separate BBC Radio programs:  John Peel's \\"Top Gear\\" (Broadcasted 3/23/1969 and 6/29/1969), \\"Chris Grant's Tasty Pop Sundae\\" (Broadcasted 6/22/1969),\\"BBC  Rock Hour\\" (\\"One Night Stand\\") (Broadcasted 8/10/1969) and Radio One's \\"In Concert\\" (Recorded 1/4/1971).    <br /> <br />\\"BBC Sessions\\" is broken up into two CDs.   The first CD focuses on material from \\"Led Zeppelin I\\" and \\"Led Zeppelin II\\".   The shows that derive thismaterial are \\"Top Gear\\", \\"Tasty Pop Sundae\\", and \\"BBC Rock Hour\\".   The one thing to note is that much of this material is going to focus on Led Zeppelin's Blues days.   While I am not the biggest fan of the Blues, I had enormous respect for the quality of the music that Led Zeppelin created in this genre.    The one thing I don't like is that the music is mixed up.   I would have preferred the collection to have the music in the order by which the shows were broadcasted.   It seems the \\"Pop Sundae\\" material was broken up - disrupting the flow.  If the collection preserved the originaln chronological broadcast order, I think this would have allowed us to see how Led Zeppelin progressed from their Blues roots into a Hard Rock band.  It is worth noting the material from the first \\"Top Gear\\" broadcast (\\"You Shook Me\\", \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\", and \\"Dazed and Confused\\") comes entirely from \\"Led Zeppelin I\\". <br /> <br />The second CD is devoted entirely to the \\"In Concert\\" broadcast.   While the first CD had much more of a Blues feel, this one is going to have much more of a Classic Rock feel. (even though there is a Blues medley for \\"Whole Lotta Love\\").    This CD includes a good cross section of material from the first four Led Zeppelin albums.  This also has much more of a feel for a true concert as opposed to the first CD, which has more of a feel of a broadcast of live songs.  As mentioned above, I normally would not like this, but I feel the intent of this was to basically bring the stuff \\"out of the vault\\".  The second CD also includes \\"Thank You\\" - this particular song was not broadcasted on the \\"In Concert\\" recording. <br /> <br />One thing that is very important when considering this collection is the sound quality.   Prior to the release of \\"BBC Sessions\\", much of this material was basically available from bootleg.   Also, keep in mind - this stuff comes from a 25 month period from 1969 through 1971.   While we all know that Jimmy Page is a legendary guitarist, he must get enormous credit as a record engineer.   Page remasters this collection as brilliantly as I have ever heard any mastered.   There are many references that \\"BBC Sessions\\" shows Led Zeppelin in \\"raw\\" form.   I couldn't agree with that statement raw.   The amazing thing is - as you listen to this CD, you can almost pick out every sound that is made.  In other words, you can hear Jimmy Page's guitar, John Paul Jones' keyboards and bass, and John Bonham's drums in a most intricate manner.   Of course, don't forget the incredible and unique vocals of Robert Plant.   While \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" may be one of the all-time overplayed Classic Rock songs, the version that is included on the second CD will just completely blow you away. <br /> <br />One thing worth mentioning is that you will hear different variations of the same song on this collection.   This is truly one of the major strengths of this collection.  This shows the versatility and talent of Led Zeppelin as a band for being able to pull this off.   Multiple versions include: \\"Communication Breakdown\\", \\"Dazed and Confused\\", \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", and \\"You Shook Me\\".  As for Led Zeppelin being seen in a \\"Jam Band\\" style: \\"How Many More Times\\" (1st CD) and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" (2nd CD) are terrific while \\"Dazed in Confused\\" (2nd CD) was a bit overdrawn. <br /> <br />The liner notes include a terrific 2-panel write-up by Luis Rey in regards to Led Zeppelin and the BBC broadcasts.   As mentioned while this isn't my favorite Zeppelin material, it still is of very good quality.  It's too bad they didn't have material taken from the mid 1970s - the period that I consider the most creative of Led Zeppelin's career.  Still this is good stuff - and definitely worth checking out.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Although I've always wanted to see the Phantom on stage, I probably never will have that opportunity, but I am in love with this production!  The entire film is mesmerizing from beginning to end.  The cast could not be better.  I am not going to pick it apart, build it up or tear it down.  It caught me from the get go and the characters work together, the mood is excellent, the emotional ride is good.  It's a great movie!
0446677450|5.0|According to Kiyosaki, Americans are living in financial ignorance.  Many are living in debt, with many credit cards.  The ones that aren't are living paycheck to paycheck and not saving any money.  And the ones that do have money are investing it in the wrong things. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki's position is that saving is good, but a greater return on your money is possible by investing in assests.  According to Kiyosaki, an asset is something that makes money for you even though you're not doing anything.  Your home would not be an asset--it requires mortagage payments, insurance, property tax payments, etc., and would not necessarily increase in value.  An asset would be money invested in something like a rental property or one of the self-storage units that are so popular, something that requires minimal time and maximum return.  <br /> <br />Kiyosaki also teaches you how to legally shelter your assets and income by setting up corporations to protect that money, and your expenses, from taxes.   <br /> <br />Overall, a very good start for the financial novice.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin in the Rain is, easily, the greatest, funniest, wittiest, happiest, most creative, and most entertaining movie musical ever created.  I dont usually feel that strongly about things, but it is.  There are no dead spots, as in other musicals I've seen, and the story is just as interesting and funny as the musical numbers. This is one of those rare musical films that has a strong story and good dialogue to back up the entertainment.  It doesnt feel as if they had to just talk to fill up the time of the movie. <br /> <br />  This movie was made in an era when Gene Kelly was in his prime, and at the height of his career and success, and it shows.  He was able to dance, sing, choreograph, and direct this movie and the finished product of his efforts is amazing.  There are numerous times throughout the film when he is able to shine creatively and athletically, he brought athleticism to dance in those days.  Songs such as \\"Fit as a Fiddle\\" and \\"Moses Supposes\\" are spots where Gene and Donald O'Connor get to strut their stuff together, and they compliment eachothers' abilities beautifully.  Donald once said that Gene Kelly had to help him to dance from the waist up also, instead of only focusing on his feet, as regular tap dancers normally had in those days.  Well, O'Connor obviously overcomes any dancing obstacles he had in what is probably the best tap dancing routine ever staged on the screen.  Kelly's facials in the dance are  the typical, amazing, entertaining enjoyment he always radiates. <br />   <br />  Debbie Reynolds is also very funny and talented in this movie.  She dances with the girls of the Coconut Grove in the song \\"All I Do\\" and with Gene Kelly and O'Connor in the very lively song and dance \\"Good Morning\\".  She also dances alone with Gene in the love song \\"You Were Meant For Me\\".  For being so young and only learning tap a short while before the movie, Reynolds jumps off the screen with an exceptional first leading role. <br /> <br />  The BroadwayMelody staged in the movie is one of my very favorite parts of the movie because of the classiness, happiness and creativeness it radiates.  Again, all the work of the wonderful Gene Kelly.  Starting out in a suit and hat, the ballet starts out with such an exciting bang.  The famous duet with Cyd Charisse is marvelous, both of them together is amazing because they are both such incredible dancers.  The music in this segment of the movie encompasses the feel and look of the whole movie, lively and showy. <br /> <br />  The title number, as all of the others it seems, is very special.  Gene Kelly, again in a suit, dances and sings in the rain after saying good night to the woman he loves.  The concept and the number itself are relatively simple, but, at the risk of sounding melodramatic, the simplicity is the beauty of it.  He's 'just singin in the rain' and it's fine.  As a viewer, you cant help but smile.  It just seems to all fit together, the lyrics, location, and the dance itself, to create a classic number that will be remembered forever.  It seems to be the perfect number. <br /> <br />  Bottom line, I have seen this movie probably at least 30 times and I seriously never have gotten sick of it.  Every time feels like the first time and no matter what mood I am in, this movie, without fail, puts a smile on my face.  One cannot watch this movie and not go away feeling happy, its just too good.  It remains a brilliant acievement creatively and entertainment wise.  Nothing feels like an old movie, the dialogue and the numbers are still funny, and exceptional, 55 years later.  It is everything a great musical is and more.  Singin in the Rain really is the greatest movie musical ever made.   <br />   <br />
0385513755|1.0|After the hype, hysteria and all that time on the best-seller list, I was expecting something fairly spectacular (or at least, something as good as 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'). At that, it took a cardinal bad-mouthing it to get me to buy and read it. Luckily, the used bookstore will take it on a trade-in - only about 100 pages used.<br />The book reads like 'Robert Ludlum meets Judith Krantz meets Dean Koontz', not a happy combination. Is this really what passes for a 'best seller' these days? Or were all those people reading it because it was trendy?
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This movie is one that I rent and look forward to seeing every time.  It is one of those special movies that never gets old, and is such great quality.  The music is one of the reasons I have loved it so much. The composer, Thomas Newman, also did The Horse Whisperer, which had the same kind of haunting, gorgeous music throughout it too.  It helps to tell the story and is, in my opinion, perfect.        The good parts by far outweigh the at times hard to watch prison life.  This is because the story is so inspirational and moving, that by the end, you forget about those bad times.  It examines and is a testament to the human spirit, and is told/portrayed so well that the end result is powerful.  The good times consist of the friendships between the men in the prison and the way they try to still hope and have good lives dispite of their situations.  Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, the main charcter who makes the prison break.  The times in the movie when he quietly, but at the same time loudly, defies the corrupt authority at the prison are very moving.  There is a scene where he broadcasts an opera record over the intercome of the prison, then everyone stops and listens, its really a beautiful moment and a powerful thought, that every human has to have hope to keep going in life.  This thought is the driving force of the movie and is worked to perfection.  Every aspect of the movie, the music, the circumstances, the dialogue, all confirm this notion and stand out throughout the film.    Morgan Freeman plays Red, his friend he meets in prison.  His performance is just as good and his character just as important to the story as Robbins'.  The movie is narrated throughout using his voice, such a good choice for narration dont ya think?  The deep friendship between the two of them is another driving force for this movie.  It shows the bonds that can form between two people in these kinds of circumstances.  These two exceptional actors make this movie a real stand outin the films over the years.      Bottom line, this is a wonderful piece of cinema that I am glad is so highly acclaimed and remembered.  It ranks very high up there in my favorites of all time.
B0002S947K|4.0|Ray Lamontagne's tracks are a very nice blend of the moodiness and intelligence of Damien Rice and the blues-folk fusion of Ben Harper. On a final comparative note, the entire time I was listening to the CD, I couldn't help but be reminded of Eric Martin (lead singer of Mr. Big) singing \\"To Be With You\\". <br /> <br />On the first listen, I gladly heard every track in its entirety without the usual itchy trigger-finger hovering above the skip button. Granted, other than some well-placed mid-tempo numbers, I couldn't tell one track from the other. Still, if the entire album has to sound like one song, he picked a really good song. <br /> <br />The album is a must for any TV or movie soundtrack producer. His writing is full of very specific and vivid imagery, settings and situations. And, the instrumentation and vocals are equally keen at invoking both mood and memory. <br /> <br />Pick a track - any track - and listen to the preview snippet. If you like it, buy the CD. You will not be disappointed. Scout's honor.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|The title really says it all. Constantine is not a movie I expected to be good - and to be honest, the first time I saw it, I thought it was merely amusing.<br /><br />But then I discovered that the characters and storyline stick with you. REALLY, really stick with you.<br /><br />The plot is a bit predictable, but there are twists that even I did not see coming. The character of Constantine, while not faithful to the comic, is a very good one - he's delightfully bitter, resigned, and yet at the same time determined to beat fate.<br /><br />Gabriel is just completely screwy.<br /><br />Balthazaar and all the other characters make things fun as the story developes. It's definitely worth watching, and I hope that the extra scenes and alternate endings of the soon to be released DVD do it justice!
068987474X|5.0|With such a catchy title I wanted to know what's in this book, and what's different from other books that keep telling women to pay attention to the man's actions, not their words.<br /><br />This is excellent book has many ways that women continue to make excuses for why they are not getting what they want and deserve from men.<br /><br />Greg also gives succinct, in-your-face advice after each example.<br /><br />Men look for ways to score points, based upon habitual behavior in those around them.  While many women continue to try to make men into something that fits the woman's emotional agenda.<br /><br />This is a great book to check in with your relationship radar.
0316172324|3.0|Thanks Malcolm for this fun read. The stories are mildly thought provoking, but nothing that stays with you too long. I was hoping for a way to thinking to help me make a decision about something on which I have too much information. Blink did not help with that. Fun, but...
B0006IIPIK|2.0|I can appreciate what the filmmakers tried to do here - pay tribute to those pulp comic books and campy sci-fi films of the Golden Era (which I love, by the way) while also trying to revolutionize the whole art of CGI effects - but there's really no hiding the fact that Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is one dog of a movie.  I'm not talking about an adorable little Yorkie or even a cute but annoying Chihuahua; I'm talking about one great big mangy, mud-covered, tick-infested, shaggy mutt of a dog.  The whole story is ridiculous, the script is consistently groan-inducingly dreadful, and the acting is about as bad as I've seen in a long, long time.  Don't count on Angelina Jolie (in little more than a cameo) to bail this one out; it's way too far gone before she ever shows up.<br /><br />So what do we have here?  Well, in what is best described as some futuristic 1930s world (and how crazy does that sound?), there's some mad scientist sending legions of humongous robots to reek havoc all over the world.  It's like The Iron Giant was seduced by the dark side of the force and then cloned a bazillion times.  On the ground, we have the intrepid and incredibly annoying reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), who's on the story of several missing scientists when the giants attack.  Helpless authorities send out the equivalent of a bat signal to Sky Captain, aka Joe Sullivan (Jude Law).  This guy apparently spends all of his time flying in his P-40 just waiting for a call to save the world (and don't even get me started on the whole \\"gas mileage\\" issue).  As the story progresses, Perkins and Sky Captain team up to discover who is causing all of this mischief so they can track him down to his hidden lair and save the world.  In between aerial battles and visually incredible flying sequences, our two heroes constantly snipe at each other over their former love affair.  No matter how tense the action gets, or how few seconds the world is away from annihilation, these two always make the time to bicker like a couple of teenagers who just broke up.  The addition of Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie) aboard her top-secret flying platform somewhere over Asia only adds fuel to the extended lovers' spat.<br /><br />I won't even begin to describe all of the science fiction shenanigans writer-director Kerry Conran throws into this film (the words \\"everything but the kitchen sink\\" come to mind).  All of these special effects are, I suppose, the real selling point of the film.  They are - for the most part - quite impressive, and the whole movie certainly has a unique look and feel to it, what with basically everything but the prominent actors being a creation of CGI effects.  I'm sure the actors had quite a time performing all of their scenes in front of blue screens, but they never really had much of a chance given the mediocre script.  I have mentioned just how dreadful the dialogue in this film is, haven't I?  Conran doesn't just run a gag into the ground - he tunnels all the way through to China with it.  And it continues all the way through the final line; I really wanted to just slap somebody after this movie finally ended.<br /><br />As impressive as the CGI effects of this movie are, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow actually offers compelling evidence that CGI-created films such as this are not a good idea at all - I never bought into the idea that these characters were actually in the environment, and that necessarily prevented me from connecting to these characters at all.  Special effects do not a movie make.  I mean, a rose is pretty to look at, but I don't want to stare at one for over an hour and a half.  It really doesn't take very long for you to get used to the unusual look of this film, and after that point you're left with nothing more than bad actors delivering painful dialogue from a mediocre script.  My oohs and aahs were greatly outnumbered by my groans and \\"for Pete's sake\\" comments during the film.e two always make the time to bicker like a couple of teenagers who just broke up.

B00008PW2D|4.0|I understand fully the disappointment of the shortened season, however, i dont feel that this season, although only 8 episodes, is no worse than any of the others.  Granted i would have liked to see alot more of SATC in this season, however, this is still an entertaining.  I also join the other reviewers with the disguist atthe price of this season, only about half the episodes of the other seasons, and it is still full price.  my advice is this, if you are a true SATC lover you need this season, i feel the characters gain more depth in this season, especially miranda with the birth of her child brady.  I dont have too many complaints becuase i bought this season for about $23 from an independent seller on amazon.com, i suggest you do the same!  it's definitely worth buying if you can find it for less!
B000000WZ4|5.0|Ultra was their first post Wilder album and whilst it is not as good as Exciter it is the most inspired work that DM had created for quite some time. Songs like home, sister of night and bottom line all show what Fletcher, Gore and Gahan are capeable alone and without the dominering attitude of Alan Wilder. It was also the first time that they had employed outside artists to play on their records and the end result is quite amazing. They needed new blood and the idea to have outside artists come in and help with the recording is a stroke of genius. Dave Gahans vocals are not as good as on Exciter but they are much better then on SOFAD. This is an awesome synth pop album that should not be missed.
B000001E3L|4.0|This is a great live album with a good mix of old standbys and songs for the hard core.  His band on this CD was outstanding.  If you're a newcomer to Van Morrison looking for a \\"best of\\" album in a live format, this one is not for you (try \\"Too Late To Stop Now\\"). <br /> <br />My only real issue with the album was his back-up singer, Brian Kennedy.  His voice drives me nuts, as he has this annoying \\"dramatic\\" crack when he finishes a phrase on a high note, and he seems to have to ease into a long note as if he's making up for a lack of range or lung capacity.  And he sings way too much on this album for my taste - unfortunately ruining Tupelo Honey for me. <br /> <br />But that's a nit-pick on an otherwise great album.
1400031362|5.0|This book is the third installment in the \\"No.1 Ladies Detective Angency\\" series. Once again, Precious Ramotswe is solving mysteries for her fellow Botswanas. The mysteries include a case of poisoning, and a wild orphan boy found wandering in the bush. Also in this one, Mr. Matekoni is having a personal crises, and Mma Makutsi is promoted to manage the garage. <br /> <br />As in the first two books in the series, this book is very well-written and the descriptions of Botswana are breathtaking. Although I loved this book, I found it not quite as engaging as the first two books were; I think because the mysteries in this one are a  bit more mundane. But it's still an excellent book, and I highly recommend it to anyone--especially if you're looking for something a bit more unique!
B00005JL78|5.0|I really loved this film, at the beginning I didn't expect much, I knew it was over 2 hours and if I didn't enjoy it I'd be dragging along! At the beginning you see the movie is set in the future, about 50 years from now, that didn't really appeal to me much, but as the movie went on, the more and more I was into it and blown away! <br /> <br />In the future they have a 'PreCrime' unit where they stop murders from before they even happen. No murders in Washington D.C. in over 6 years! Not bad, huh? Though it's not that simple. There is so much more to it. It's so explicit, twisted and a wonderful mind blowing Sci-Fi invention as much so as 'The Matrix'! <br /> <br />I managed to predict something in the film, and it came true, then it was blown away right before the guy blew himself away!... You'll have to watch to understand! <br /> <br />I don't want to go through explaining it, its not a simple machine that tells you who is going to commit a crime real soon in the future, its extremely far from it, like they say, it will blow your mind! You will see and understand it all for yourself, and if it doesn't hit you the first time, watch it again. <br /> <br />The main reason I write a review is if I'd really recommend a film or not. This is one of the best films ever made, so I'd definitely recommend it. Like many movies, this is the one you definitely enjoy best the first time round, so pay attention at all times, stay focused, if you miss something quickly go back, because the first time round Minority Report will BLOW YOU AWAY! <br /> <br />PS: If you loved and understood 'The Matrix', then you'll love this movie. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise' best work. <br /> <br />Seriously, it's absolutely mind blowing. Don't wait. Go see it.
B0007NFL18|1.0|50 Cent is a disgrace to rap, and to music in general.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE:<br /><br />Metal_gangsta, YOU are the complete idiot. You say G-Unit is awesome, Public Enemy sucks, and call Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park metal. You better be kidding! PE are possibly the best rap group of all time! G-Unit sucks! And for calling LP and LB metal, go buy a copy of Cephalic Carnage's \\"Anomalies\\" and think those two bands are metal! And hwile you're at it, buy a copy of Public Enemy's \\"Fear of a Black Planet\\".<br /><br />With the side note being said, DukeOfEarl is right. 50 Cent has got to be the most overrated rapper of all time! I could listen to this, but I'd rather do something less painful, like papercutting my eye. For good rap, listen to Public Enemy, N.W.A., KRS-One, Nas, The Roots, Jurassic 5, Beastie Boys, etc. Just let this \\"CD\\" rot on the shelves.
B00005BL2A|5.0|Exciter being their 2001 release is an album that has the best Depeche Mode lyrics to date. The texts are very autobiographical and deal with Gahans drug abuse and the turmoil that it caused. The vocals are some of the best they have ever recorded and the group seem to have found that harmony that was missing on SOFAD and was not as good on Ultra. I personally think that the departure of Alan Wilder was needded and spurned group to new hights of creativity and not always relying on Wilders ideas and his vision for the band. Goodnight lovers, Dream on, and Freelove are just as good as songs like Enjoy the Silence, Behind the wheel and many other awesome 80's tracks. This is an excellent synth pop album with great lyrics, awesome vocals, and overall I give it 5 out of 5 stars.
B000002J09|5.0|On their fourth studio album, Led Zeppelin convincingly prove that a heavy metal band doesn't have to be all piercing vocals, ham-fisted drums, and guitar pyrotechnics. Not that you can't find those elements on this album. A quick listen to \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Rock and Roll,\\" which open the album, show that Zeppelin still had plenty of firepower.<br /><br />But there are surprises on this album.  Listen to the haunting beauty of \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" with Sandy Denny joining Robert Plant on vocals accompanied by Robert Plant's delicate mandolin playing.  Equally gorgeous is the acoustic ballad \\"Going to California.\\" And Zeppelin's take on the blues never sounded more authentic than on \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\"<br /><br />But, of course, the centerpiece of the album is the eight-minute \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" which drifts along Plant's fantasy lyrics until about five-and-a-half minutes into the song when it explodes with a flourish of Page's guitar.<br /><br />The entire album succeeds not as a result of the band's excesses, but because of their restraints.  This is a disciplined album from a band that aspired to be more than just the wrold's greatest heavy metal band.  And you know what? They succeeded.  ESSENTIAL
B00000JGOJ|5.0|This movie is sweet.I almost cryed.Angelina is wonderful in this.She was too cute.I loved Jon Stewart in it.Jon's awesome.It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.I reconmend it to anyone looking for a touching,funny,sweet movie.
B000929AJQ|3.0|First, let me just express how amazed I am about the overly-negative reviews I've seen regarding this album.  Now, I can see how some would portray this new record as being a \\"let-down\\", but it really isn't that bad of an album.  Considering the current state of music for the past 5 years, and the cost of it being only $9.99 (Best Buy)...it's really a nice breath of fresh air.  I think many of the NIN fans are being too critical and had hopes of it being something that Reznor would never be able to fulfill.  The man is 40 y.o. and quite honestly I'm surprised he was able to make something as good and as fresh as it is.  Now, to get to \\"With Teeth\\" itself...it is a lot more accessible than other NIN albums as most people have stated.  More so than his previous effort \\"The Fragile\\", which was less inviting and not really for the casual listener.(although, my absolute fave NIN album ;-  With this album, many of the songs have more hooks and the music is more straight ahead with shorter song lengths.  And as Reznor promised,...it has a more organic feel than any other NIN ever released.  I think of it being really \\"percussion-driven\\" for the most part.  And, by that I mean the drums really stand out more than anything else.  The songs seem more stripped and simplistic than \\"The Fragile\\" which had many more layers to it.  But, this really isn't a bad thing for the average listener.  I do believe the first half of the album is better than the second.    \\"All the love in the World\\" is a nice song to start the album.  Begins with bass and electronic drums covered by soft vocals with synth and subtle piano appearing later to create a very sublime landscape.  \\"You Know What You Are?\\" is a fast up-tempo song with a chorus that hits you like a train...nice groove.  \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is your typical 'single' that rallys against the current establishment (the Bush administration, the ever controlling Religious Reich)...and is a good upbeat song.  \\"Everyday Is Exactly The Same\\" is truely meant to be the most listener-friendly single on the album...and I must admit it is my favorite track.  It to me, is the most solid and complete song on here. \\"Sunspots\\" is to me is rather bland with a \\"Prince-inspired\\" chorus.  \\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" is a decent song, with a typical sounding NIN chorus that slowly grinds with hopelessness.  \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" is a perfect track to close the album.  It's very bleak and just quitely rides along in isolation with self-doubting lyrics that emotionally grab the listener.  Overall, I think it's a good record.  Although, I would have to question the title.  It's not near as edgey as the title would suggest.  And, the pure agression that is found on NIN's early albums is more subdued with this outing with only hints of rage throughout it.  It is not near as \\"dark\\" as other NIN works.  And, yes the lyrics can be simple and to the point and maybe even immature at times...but, they do convey the general emotion that the music envokes.  I suggest to the people who feel the need to critizise certain elements of \\"With Teeth\\" to take it for what it is: a decent record.
B000066JES|5.0|I'm so sick and tired of hearing people trash this album. This is, simply put, THE best Manowar album to date. If you think THIS album sucks, listen to all that crap MTV plays! Who would you rather listen to, Manowar or Gay, er Good Charlotte? I rest my case. Now with that said, I will now get into the album. This is actually the first Manowar album I bought. I first heard of Manowar two years ago when I bought the Metal Blade Records 20th Anniversary Box Set, whhich had the song \\"Manowar\\" on disc 8, and \\"Warriors of the World (United)\\" and \\"House of Death\\" on disc 9. They became my favorite band since and I've been looking up their albums on the internet listening to samples to see which one I liked best. I decided to choose this as my first Manowar album. For a while, I've told myself to get it the enxt time I go to best buy or order from Amazon, but I kept on forgetting. Until one day, I finally got my copy of this album. I can't stop listening to this album! At the time I am writing this review, I am even listening to it right now! The band is very talented. Eric Adams is one of metal's (no, NOT just Power Metal) best singers. Joey DeMaio has got to be THE most underrated bassist of all time, right up there with Danny Lilker! He has some of the best bass-lines I've heard! Guitarist Karl Logan also has soem sweet solos here. He is always bashed for \\"not being as good as Ross 'The Boss' Funicello\\". Damn what they say, I think Karl can be JUST as good as Ross. And of course we have THE Scott Columbus pounding the skins. Or should I say TINS (pun intended)! He is so wild a drummer he has to use a drum kit with parts of metal instead of wood and skin! This is possibly my favorite album right now. In my collection of over 350 CDs, this is possibly my favorite one of all. The album starts with Call to Arms, it's vintage Manowar! The next song is \\"The Fight For Freedom\\", a touching tribute to the victums and those who have been affected by 9/11/01. The lyrics are amazing, seriously how does Joey DeMaio manage to write so much good music since Manowar was formed in 1979? The next song, \\"Nessun Dorma\\" is a song sung in Italian that is dedicated to Eric's mother Lillian, who passed away while the album was in progress. My favorite song here is \\"Warriros of the World (United)\\", making it my ALL-TIME favorite song! This is my theme song; words can't do it justice, you must hear it to truly appreciate it! \\"Hand of Doom\\" is my second favorite song, it's also the heaviest song on the album. \\"House of Death\\" is like a HOD pt 2, but it's not as heavy for good, but it still rules. I love all the songs here, but the above mentioned tracks are my favorites. This is a good introduction to Manowar. I reccomend starting a Manowar collection with this album. You might not agree with it being their best album, but you'll might agree with one thing: It's an exeelent album.

B000002OX7|5.0|Pete Townshend's unfinished LIFEHOUSE project resulted in the greatest Who album of their career--the phenomenal WHO'S NEXT.  In fact, many of the songs (\\"Baba O'Riley,\\" \\"Getting in Tune,\\" \\"Going Mobile,\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\") are from that aborted project. [In addition, one of the bonus tracks, \\"Pure and Easy,\\" is also a LIFEHOUSE song.]<br /><br />WHO'S NEXT kicks off with \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and its simple synthesizer riff, but a minute into the song, it shifts gears and becomes classic Who with its crashing drums and windmill guitars.  It is followed by the electrifying \\"Bargain.\\" \\"Love Ain't for Keeping\\" (by far the shortest song at 2:10) features some deftly played acoustic guitar.  \\"My Wife\\" is simply John Entwhistle's best song recorded by the band. Nicky Hopkins plays piano on the lovely ballad \\"The Song Is Over\\" and \\"Getting in Tune.\\"  \\"Going Mobile\\" could be considered a companion piece to Entwhistle's \\"My Wife,\\" and is certainly the least serious of Townshend's songs on the album.<br /><br />The original album closed with a solid one-two punch.  The gorgeous \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" and the majestic \\"Won't Get Fooled Again.\\" The latter contains the best recorded scream in the history of rock 'n' roll. [I still get chills every time I hear it!] More than thirty years and countless reunion tours later, this album makes clear what a powerful band the Who could be when they were at the top of their game.

B00065GX64|5.0|This famous Fritz Lang classic is about a child murderer in Germany who finally meets justice not at the hands of the authorities but by fellow undesireables.  <br />The story is said by many  to be loosely based on the true story of the vampire of Dusseldorf .  <br />However the murderer in this movie  is not only a monster, he is a complex character that is also somewhat charming and childlike himself. So when we are not being repulsed by him we might find ourselves identifying him. Indeed when he stands in judgement before a judge and jury of criminals he might indeed be seen as a symbol of all humanity. <br />The movie is  a watershed  in film making in many ways and was perhaps the first successful \\"talkie\\" of the continent.  <br />The  short title is the one that made it through the Nazis censors who would not allow the  word 'murder\\" or \\"murderer\\"(or in this case the working title of the movie which was \\"Murderer are Among Us\\") in the title of a movie.   <br />It stars Peter Lorre who was more famous at the time as a surrealist than as a member of the movie trio that included  Humprey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet.  <br />The murders occur in squlid neighborhoods and this adds to making the movie quite atmospheric.  <br />The police in trying to track the murderer down use what were at that time modern investigative techiques making this moive the the grandfather to all crime movies and TV crime dramas. <br />But this is more than just an atmospheric murder mystery as it was a veiled but direct attack on the culture of the Nazi regime as well as a philosophicl discourse and an exploration of the human psyche. <br />This edition includes a second a DVD with commentary by Fritz Lang (who was himself no stranger to surrealism) , William Friedkin and others. <br />Highly recommended. <br />
0553296981|5.0|The Diary of Anne Frank is a wonderful story. I was horrifed at everything that she had to go through and im so thankful that the holocaust hasnt happened again.<br /><br />Eariler I was reading through the reviews and I am shocked at some of things I've read. That the diary is a FAKE, and its a horrible read. How could someone make something up like this? And I've read that you think its uninformative. Its not supposed to be a history book. It's about how a 13-15 year old girl lived during the holocaust. It wasn't a reflection back on what happened. I'm sure not most 13-15 year olds write about the political events happening today. She didn't purposely write her diary for someone publishing it in the future. A diary is our own thoughts so her crush is what she thought about at the time. Im just appalled of the reviews ive read. Myself  being Jewish, I find it offensive for people to say it didnt happen. I'm glad the diary was written so everyone will get to see the tragedy that happened to a normal person just like you and me and hopefully learn from the Nazi's mistakes and not repeat them.
1592400876|2.0|The premise of this book seems odd from the start, but it was so hyped by NPR and other reviewers that I decided to give it a chance since I come from a family of women who are irked by putting \\"quotes\\" around inappropriate phrases, using apostrophes to indicate plural word's and confusing \\"fewer\\" with \\"less\\". But despite the hype, I was not very impressed. <br /> <br />One of the first things that bothered me about this book is that it starts out referring to a joke about a Panda. Personally I had never heard this joke and she apparently assumed that everyone who could read knew it already. As a result, she never actually told the joke that the book was titled for, which seemed very strange to me. Each time she referred to it, I had to hope that my version of it - the one that I made up based on her comments - was accurate. So my first piece of advice to Ms. Truss is, \\"Before you name a book for a joke, please share that joke with the reader.\\" <br /> <br />Despite the lack of information about the title joke, the first chapter was interesting enough, even if I couldn't quite relate to the very extreme emotions that punctuation misuse invoked. But after about chapter two, it started drifting and ended up just being a punctuation guide billed as a clever, entertaining book. The truth is that no matter how good the author may be (and I am not so sure she is), nothing can make a whole book about punctuation interesting.  <br /> <br />I guess the overall problem with this book is that it is confused about who the target reader is. It starts out by appealing to the obsessive person who secretly wishes to go around with a huge marker fixing up poorly punctuated signs (something I have never seriously considered doing), but slowly drifts into lessons on correct punctuation. This schizophrenic shift seems very odd because in the beginning she is very definitely talking to those who already know these things and recommends that if the punctuation errors given don't make yourblood boil, you should not read the book. So who is the book intended for? <br /> <br />I think this was a great idea that would have made a great article, or that possibly started out as a great article and was expanded to make a book. But in doing so it lost its initial appeal and just turned into another (ho-hum) grammar lesson.  <br /> <br />My advice...if you are a punctuation stickler, read the first few chapters. If you wonder what all the fuss is about, read the next few. If you just want a punctuation guide, go for a \\"Cliff Notes\\" guide to punctuation.  I don't think anyone would find the entire book worthwhile.  <br />
B000000W5N|5.0|By the end of the Sixties, the Stones were touted as \\"The World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band.\\"  And STICKY FINGERS, their first studio album of the Seventies, did nothing to tarnish that reputation.<br /><br />While only a couple of the songs, the hit single \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking,\\" are typical Stones rockers; the album is highlighted by such classics as the country-influenced \\"Wild Horses,\\" the bleak drug song \\"Sister Morphine,\\" and the authentic blues of Fred McDowell's \\"You Gotta Move,\\" the album's lone cover.<br /><br />Not only is this a terrific collection of songs, but the Andy Warhol cover (complete with working metal zipper on the original LP) is a classic.

B00004T8RK|5.0|While walking through a local CD shop I happened upon this disc which I had no idea even existed. I have the live acoustic CD so I recognized a few of the songs on here so I figured I'd give it a chance. My first impression was, \\"Wow, the sound quality is horrible.\\" But after listening to the entire album I came to the conclusion that it's that sound quality that makes this CD unique. Now I know no Pearl Jam CD is polished or perfect sounding, but this sounds down right old. With no song on this being a radio/MTV hit, it's easy to see why this gem was overlooked. In my opinion, however, this is Pearl Jam's crowning achievement. Every song is absolutely amazing, with varying degrees of emotion in each song.<br /><br />This disc starts off with a bang, Breakerfall. I've heard people say the first three songs are a bit of a disappointment but I see it differently. I think when given a chance, they all are highlights. But hearing the songs live sheds new light on them (check out 'Touring Band 2000'). Breakerfall is a fast-paced anthem that will not soon leave you. A personal favorite of mine is Thin Air. This isn't by any means a heavy, fast, or even loud song. It's just a very touching ballad-esque song. Definitely a song to listen to. Grievance is simply put, awesome. Everything about this song is catchy, I need not say more. Sleight of Hand seems to be a more emotionally charged song. It's entirely different acoustic so it took me a few listens to really appreciate this studio version, but it's now my favorite version. Of The Girl is a simple yet effective song. Not a lot of singing, not much of anything really, but for some reason I feel it's one of the best songs on here. We finish this ride with Parting Ways. This is a nice closer for this CD, it's slow and meaningful. Classic Pearl Jam, reminescent of Black.<br /><br />Just a few of my favorite songs are Breakerfall, Thin Air, Grievance, Insignificance, and Of The Girl. If you're a Pearl Jam fan but have yet to hear this I suggest you take time out of your schedule to listen to it. I think it's marvelous from start to finish. The only Pearl Jam CD that even comes close to this, in my opinion, is Vs.to hear this I suggest you take time out of your schedule to listen to it. I think it's marvelous from start to finish.

I would rather have stomach cramps for two hours than watch this horrible tripe again. <br /> <br />I am a male - not the intended audience. I believe that the intended audience must be people with dementia. They would be spared the pain of possibly remembering even one second of this unbelievably bad movie. This movie deserves a rating of zero, plus, everyone involved with this film should be sentenced to prison. <br /> <br />Never has there been a more insulting movie passed on as entertainment.

B00006399Z|4.0|\\"Welcome To The Canteen\\" is Traffic recorded live in 1971, following the big success of their 1970 comeback album, \\"John Barleycorn Must Die,\\" and it features the surprise return of original guitarist Dave Mason to the fold, albeit much too briefly (he would play six gigs with the band, and then leave again). Traffic men Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood are joined on this live set not only by Mason but also bassist Rick Grech, drummer Jim Gordon and percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah, and although sound quality on \\"Canteen\\" is not the greatest (though this remastered version cleans it up as best as possible), the performances from the band are rock solid, including a marvelous version of \\"40,000 Headmen\\" that actually tops the studio original. As totally great as the studio original of \\"Headmen\\" is, the band give the song a little more ebb and flow live in concert, making it even more powerful than before. Mason shines with his two solo spotlight songs, \\"Sad And Deep As You\\" and \\"Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave\\" (both from his classic \\"Alone Together\\" album), and Traffic also deliver a funky \\"Medicated Goo,\\" and a pair of awesome, extended jams on \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" and Winwood's classic oldie with the Spencer Davis Group, \\"Gimme Some Lovin'.\\" Just six tracks long, \\"Welcome To The Canteen\\" does leave you hungry for more---it most certainly would've been even better as a double album. But still, this is undoubtedly a great live document of Traffic in their prime. \\"Welcome To The Canteen,\\" indeed!

0312954468|5.0|What a Wonderful Read...<br /><br />This was just a wonderful book. I found it to read so easily and the story was marvelous. Who cares about the history being 'right on'. It is fiction people. That is your clue right there. This was the first book I have read by Wilbur Smith and I can tell you I am going to be reading alot more of his. Especially Warlock and The Seventh Scroll. I just could not get enough of this book. It does get gory in spots but that is how it was back then. The sex I felt was minimal and handled with taste. Go get this book. It is well worth it and then some.
B000002JS6|5.0|Back in Black was AC/DC's first album after original singer Bon Scott died. While I don't like Brian Johnson's singing as much as Bon's. Johnson did a wonderful job of stepping in and not trying to imitate Scott and adding his own style to these songs. <br /> <br />AC/DC has always been about the guitar riff and Black in Black has some of their best. Their is not a weak song on the CD. Angus and Malcolm's guitar blare at you the  whole way through, almost daring you to be man enough to keep listening. People complain that the words are juvenile. Yes, they are. But as I said, they are all about the guitar riff. <br /> <br />Lyrically, AC/DC never pretended to by Dylan or someone trying to write poetry. They came right out and said we like to drink, have sex and play rock n' roll so we write songs about it. If you like hard rock music, you must have this CD.

0060920084|1.0|I'd heard many great things about Bill Bryson, so when a friend loaned me this book with gushing praise, I was looking forward to a good chuckle.  The most I managed was a few sardonic smirks.  Mr Bryson writes in coherent sentences, although in some cases, he should remember there is such a thing as a full stop and sometimes, it's better to say things in two or three sentences instead of endless droning.  His observations aren't particularly eye opening.  He thinks he's better than everyone else and that all his fellow Americans are overweight uneducated red neck trailer trash.  He is in turn mean, nasty, condescending and superior.  I thought maybe he was trying to be funny, but it certainly didn't come across that way. <br /> <br />Still, I kept plugging on throughout the book expecting it to get better, but it didn't.  The way he described the America he saw made me want to avoid going there (even though I have been there and I enjoyed the country immensely).  I guess what I don't like about his writing style is his air of superiority. It comes through in waves, although underneath he doesn't strike me as a particularly intelligent or interesting person.  When a person becomes an expat from his own country and then comes back to write about it, you should at least expect some funny insights and fresh perspective.  With this book, I found neither.  Just a condescending moron who really should have stayed in England. <br /> <br />Overall, the whole tone throughout the book left me uneasy and with a nasty taste in my mouth.  I certainly won't be reading any more of his books, let alone spending my hard earned money on buying one.

It's fun, witty, and very smart. Veronica is a strong female character who goes to High school where she is not the most popular girl and at the same time she is trying to figure out who murdered her best friend. Every episode will take you one step closer to who killed Lilly Kane. Watch it! you WILL get hooked!!!!!! Best show!
B00005BL2A|4.0|it seems a lot of fans didn't like the change in sound on Exciter.  i love it!  i think this album is very solid, though not quite as good as Ultra, Violator or Songs of Faith & Devotion (my favorites).      there are a variety of songs on here, but the production throughout the album is very consistent.  though, i wonder if maybe it's too consistent.  the album is almost hypnotizing.  as some other reviews have mentioned, the title is sort of misleading because it's not really exciting.  however, it is a great album to make love to.  so, maybe that's what the title refers to.  many of the tracks are rather mellow, and while there are a handful of upbeat tracks, the overall feel is very laid back.  it's the perfect album for chilling out on a summer evening or to put your moves on.
B00079018K|3.0|It seems like I've heard a lot of this before. And the sounds get a little tedious within the disc itself. But it is about average overall, and given a lot of pure dreck out there, it's alright. <br /> <br />It might help, of course, that I'm not well versed in the sources copied/inspired/stolen from, so is a bit fresher than it might otherwise be. <br /> <br />Club Foot is good, as is Test Transmission. Most of the others have some catchy hooks will playing, but nothing very memorable afterward IMO. <br /> <br />And since the disc is now, fair use, on my ipod, it must not be that hard to get it there. Spend 5 minutes here and elsewhere and solutions present themselves pretty quickly.
B000002UR7|5.0|I don't why most radiohead fans don't love this album, the crunchy guitars, wicked lead hooks, Its amazing how they created something so brilliant, I keep playing this album over and over again, i also have it on vinyl and can't put it down.

0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind is a truly fantastic book.<br /><br />The story is original and fills the imagination.  Each nuance plays an important role in developing your fascination with the characters.  The long time line, subplots, and details of the well-defined characters are at times a little bit overwhelming, but the author brings them together to present to readers an incredibly rich novel.<br /><br />The setting adds to the intensity, power, and delight of this book like none other I have ever read.  It is clear that every part of the setting is equally important to the author, from each detail in one character's apartment to the city and country (Barcelona, Spain) and the complex social and political climate of the time that encompasses the tale. Every part is dramatically and vividly alive and important to the book.<br /><br />The characters are alive, each with a fully developed story of their own.<br /><br />The writing is very special.  It would have been easy to make this story successful with simple and unimaginative words, but that's far from what you find.  It's hard to believe that this was translated from Spanish.  The language flows smoothly through complicated details that could easily be cumbersome and tight twists and turns that could easily have lost the reader.<br /><br />Bonus - there are some great one-liners in there that are almost philosophical and worth reading in their own right.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
0440238609|5.0|If you only like books when you agree with the author's point of view, and you're conservative (especially religiously conservative) don't read this trilogy; you will hate it. <br /> <br />I am infatuated with (adore/love) this trilogy. I loved it immediately, as soon as I figured out what a daemon was, and the more I read, the more I loved. The story is utterly complex and very intelligent. The themes tend to be dark, or at best realistic. The characters are well-developed, there's plenty of action, and everything is vividly described, especially Lyra's world. (Granted descriptions may not be complete, but I'd say they're complete enough that you can fill in the missing details with no problems, although they might not correspond with someone else's ideas.) <br /> <br />Being an adult (with no children), I can't say what it's like to read it as a child, nor how appropriate it is for a child. The basic theme of the series is to illustrate the growing up process, so I don't think the series can be fully appreciated until you are an adult.
0316172324|3.0|Blink is comprised of a combination of multiple stories that are used as examples to demonstrate Gladwell's ideas of how individuals think and how decisions are made.  Gladwell focuses on how important first impressions are and how individuals focus on the small things that eventually led him to the power of thinking.   In my opinion this is a book for anyone, it is very insightful for any profession and every day life occurrences.  It encourages one to trust our instincts and describes the power of our intuitive ability.  Blink would also be good if one is curious about how the mind works and the process of thinking.  I would recommend this to an individual who enjoys books with case-studies and is looking for a good book that is a fast read.  I enjoy reading books with case-studies and I believe that they help one to understand an idea and technique, but I thought Gladwell used too many.  I thought he could have fully developed some of his ideas and eliminated others.  In addition, I thought he developed his ideas in a chaotic manner.  In some of the case studies he started explaining the story and then stopped without finishing.  He would then start another case study and finally later on the chapter he would go back to the first one.  It made it hard to follow and some of his ideas were confusing. I often did not understand how the case studies fit until he finished them in his later sections. I think his greatest flaw is his randomness.  I enjoyed the stories and I found his ideas and techniques insightful, but I believe they would be easier to follow and more effective if they were written in a more organized manner.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber's Broadway musical version of Gaston Leroux's Gothic horror tale of The Phantom of the Opera is one of the most popular musicals of all time---it's still running, at the Majestic Theater---but, going into Joel Schumacher's film adaptation of the musical, I had never seen it onstage (nor have I read the book). I had heard some of the original cast recording, and marveled at Michael Crawford's intensity and vocal beauty in the role of the lovelorn Phantom. Otherwise, I basically went into the film cold...and, with some qualifications, that's the way I left.    Oh, it's not a terrible movie, I suppose. I, for one, am perfectly willing to defend Lloyd Webber's often-derided music: it may be derivative; and Lloyd Webber may not know the first thing about musical development (doesn't \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" sound too much like...well, every other big ballad in the musical, especially \\"Angel of Music\\"?); but, at climactic points, it is so lusciously orchestrated that, especially towards the end, I couldn't help but be enchanted by the score. I was much less enchanted by the lyrics, which seems so divorced from context that I stopped paying attention to the words after a while.    Additionally, I have to admit, as simply a parade of visual glamor, Joel Schumacher makes an ideal leader. He has an unmistakable eye for beautiful imagery, both pretty and creepy. His imagining of Paris from the rooftop of the Paris Opera is breathtaking; so is the image of Christine walking through falling snow in a cemetery. Some of the imagery is pretty amazing...but it amazes only as eye candy, with very little expressive depth to the images other than its own slick pictorial wonderfulness.    And that, in essence, is what is wrong with this movie: for all of its romantic huffing and puffing, this Phantom of the Opera lacks soul. The central romantic triangle between the poor Phantom (Gerard Butler), soprano Christine (Emmy Rossum), and Christine's boyfriendRaoul (Patrick Wilson) has all the weight of something out of a high school drama. And, fatally, there is very little terror or romantic warmth to be found in any of this overbaked film's agonizingly labored 143 minutes. It's all cinematographer John Mathieson's pretty pictures in the service of a thin and ultimately uninvolving plot. (Surely, Gaston Leroux's book must have been something more than a mere Gothic soap opera.) Only at the end do the filmmakers generate a palpable feeling of sadness---but, by then, I felt too exhausted to make much of an effort to connect with the characters.    A word about the performances. Of the three leads, Patrick Wilson has the worst luck; he's saddled with a bland, personality-free character, and unfortunately Wilson---so much more involving as tortured gay Mormon Joe Pitt in Mike Nichols' HBO miniseries Angels in America---does little to bring life to the underwritten part. As the Phantom, Butler is more effective---he's at his most touching in the film's grand finale---but he certainly doesn't efface memories of Michael Crawford, either vocally or emotionally. (Not only that, but Butler is way too young and handsome for the part of the ugly, father-figure Phantom; when his mask finally comes off, he looks less like Lon Chaney---who played the Phantom in Rupert Julian's 1925 horror film version of the story---than a GQ model with scar tissue.) Emmy Rossum, of course, has garnered most of the acclaim from this movie. She is an appealing young actress who can sing (although her singing voice doesn't come close to suggesting one that would earn her popularity as an opera singer; for all her limitations as an actress, Sarah Brightman at least sounded operatic), but, truth be told, I found her performance bland overall. As hard as she tried to convey desperation and yearning, I rarely felt that Rossum truly felt those emotions herself; those facial expressions of hers as she is being seduced seem more calculated than spontaneous. The only actor in the cast who makes a real impression is Minnie Driver, who hams it up impressively as Carlotta, the overbearing diva with an Italian accent two miles wide. It's a humorous caricature, but she's not onscreen for very long.    In short, only if you value visual and aural glitz over genuine emotional substance will you find this Phantom of the Opera to be worthwhile. Otherwise, I'd say skip it.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Like fine wine... this cd is is Plant's most original, well thought out music of his solo career yet. Each track is different from the next, and when not rocking and rolling, it follows the jazz-rock niche that he seems to have carved out all on his own. The percussion, and mystic rhythms are unreal! (I don't know what the reviewer \\"Zep fan\\" is crying about, but don't believe it. Some people are still waiting for the next \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", or whatever. Put away the Zeppelin Army jacket, and grow up!) This cd soars in every manner. It helps if your over 14 and not expecting another \\"Kashmir\\", or \\"Stairway\\". Pure sonic decadence!
B000003TAW|5.0|you need to buy it. (Seriously, I thought everyone already owned this album.) If you're into punk-pop, then this album is absolutely necessary for your collection. Perhaps it's not quite as necessary as Dookie (Green Day) but it's almost as important. In fact, this album may be more important if you're a nerd rocker. (Not many punk bands will reference dungeons & dragons in \\"In the Garage.\\") The lyrics and music are more complex (dare I say intelligent?) than the aforementioned Dookie, but just as catchy.

I mean the first one was a classic, we all know that.  Usually nothing can beat the first movie, but this one is almost as good as it.  I really don't know why Patrick Swayze made an appearance?  I mean it was nice seeing him in it, but it just seemed pointless.   <br /> <br />Anyway, good movie - you'll like it ;)

B00030590I|5.0|This is more than simply an action movie; this is also a movie for the thoughful and artistic. I wouldn't say the main focus of the movie is the martial arts, although there are definitely a hefty number of fighting scenes, enough to satisfy you if that's what you're looking for. The main focus of the movie is probably the visual arts. If you're looking for an artistic movie, this is one of the best. The use of color and movement is just gorgeous. Finally, this movie leaves you with food for thought using a great story.
0767817664|5.0|It's safe to say that Charley Brewster has a short attention span. In fact, that's probably an understatement. But, when Charley oversees his new neighbor committing murder through his bedroom window, he finally gets some focus in his life. Much to the dismay of his family and friends, however, his new focus is on vampires. After a violent confrontation with Jerry, the creature next door, Charley is desperate to destroy the monster, and he attempts to enlist the aid of local \\"Fright Night\\" horror host Peter Vincent, the fearless vampire killer, to do it. Unbelieving Peter is reluctant, but Charley's girlfriend Amy and creepy-geek friend, Evil Ed, convince him with a bit of financial persuading. Their intention is to prove to Charley that Jerry Dandrige is not a vampire at all, but they are in for the scare of their lives, and it's anybody's guess who will survive the real \\"Fright Night!\\"<br /><br />\\"Fright Night\\" is an 80s vampire flick for the classic horror fanatic! Paying homage to such staples as Dark Shadows and the Hammer Dracula franchise, this surprising little horror film supplies vampire lore and cliches aplenty, put together so skillfully that the result is this horror fan's favorite vampire indulgence. Of course, this favoritism is in no small part due to spectacular effects and performances! The cast seems tailor made for their roles as they play them, even if some choices seem a bit odd superficially. Hard to imagine this vampire pining away over the centuries for Married With Children's Marcy D'Arcy, but Amanda Bearse plays the role of the teenage object of Chris Sarandon's desires to perfection. Chris, himself, is powerfully convincing and menacing as the hip, 80's vampire. Extremely well adjusted to the times, too. His slave-boy zombie, Billy Cole, is played by an excellently creepy Jonathan Stark, but he's out-creeped by the always somewhat disturbing Stephen Geoffreys as Evil Ed. Of course, William Ragsdale IS Charlie Brewster, and his portrayal is what propels the film. The icing on THIS cake, however, aside from the teenage victim in the window that I've had a crush on all my life, played by someone named Irina Irvine, is the brilliant performance of one of my all-time faves, Roddy \\"Bullwhip\\" McDowall, as Peter Vincent, vampire killer! The late, great Roddy McDowall is definitely the yeast that raises this film from vampire movie mediocrity. Despite the nearly bare bones disc, featuring only a trailer and double-sided widescreen/fullscreen selection, this DVD is a must own for vampire, horror, and McDowall fans alike. Be prepared for some cheezy 80's music and a great time that you'll want to experience again and again! Also, be sure to check out \\"Fright Night 2,\\" one of the best sequels ever made!propels the film.

0451191153|5.0|I hadn't heard of Ayn Rand until I was in college. I met her through her writings as a \\"libertarian\\" and I didn't agree with those opinions. Although I was a philosophy student, I hadn't heard of objectivism, and given my previous exposure to her, I was quite wary of reading her novels. <br /> <br />I'm sorry I hadn't read her novels first. I know that there are few objectivists in the world, and I'm not a strong one as far as they go, but I immediately related with the main character. I found this a totally successful novel (unlike Atlas Shrugged) because I was immediately drawn into novel through the characters. <br /> <br />This also makes a compelling philosophical argument. After reading this it's hard to imagine that one shouldn't try to do the best work possible.
B00008S2VG|4.0|(...)it's a great album that was overlooked because of the controversy surrounding the \\"American Life\\" video. \\"Nothing Fails\\" is one of Madonna's best songs ever. \\"Intervention\\" and \\"X Static Process\\" are pleasures to listen to as well.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is amazing. It may not be your favorite Green Day album, because you liked the sound or lyrics of another album better, but this is great album. I happen to like Dookie better, but I find this is a superior album. <br /> <br />It's quite amazing what Green Day accomplishes with this album. They maintain their quintessential sound they established way back when, yet musically they grew. This is something that very few bands can do (see Social Distortion, Sex, Love, and Rock 'n' Roll sounds exactly the same as Social Distortion, no growing at all. A band can only repeat the exact same thing so many times before people get bored.), yet it is a must to be successful. <br /> <br />This is a self-proclaimed \\"Rock Opera\\" (although many say it doesn't reach that level and is only a \\"concept album\\"). I agree; the album has leitmotifs! This is an album that can only be done justice by listening to the whole thing straight through. It can never be appreciated by skipping songs or listening at random, and you can't get the full idea from the singles on the radio.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Those words give Porco Rosso, the \\"Red Pig\\", carte blanche to act in ways that Marco Berlini (his former self) couldn't. On the surface, that means mercenary and amoral.<br /><br />Sort of like Bogart in \\"Casa Blanca\\" or \\"To Have and to Have Not.\\" In other words, nothing you could easily sum up in just a few words, and he likes it that way. It helps the new guys underestimate him, just the way he wants. Also like Bogart, Rosso lives in a time and a place just outside of active war, and just outside any jurisdiction that would take an active interest in him. And again like Bogart, he enters that un-war, on no side but his own, and wins what he wanted to win.<br /><br />This isn't an animated copycat, though. It's Miyazaki's story all through, built around a romantic passion for flying and around strong, young female characters. In this case, two young women, and both a bit older than Miyazaki's usual - old enough for romance. A chaste sort of romance, up to a point. The passion for flight is the \\"Rosso\\", Marco's signature red seaplane.<br /><br />The story? Just trust Miyazaki, you know it's going to be good. Miyazaki's films all seem to target specific ages, though, and this one isn't nearly as \\"young\\" as Kiki or even \\"Spirited Away.\\" I'd guess it's good for tween/teen-agers, or adults willing to act a little child-like. That's child-like, not childish, a distinction that Miyazaki respects.<br /><br />//wiredweird
0739432176|4.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy, but it's my in my preferred genre of fantasy. This trilogy is great and throroughly recommended if you also like fantasy, especially young adult fantasy. There's tons of action, coupled with the coming of age stories of two girls which are quite compelling. <br /> <br />It's not as strong as His Dark Materials trilogy (which I recommend to everyone). I wouldn't recommend this to all adults regardless of their interests. I wouldn't even recommend this to all adults who are interested in fantasy, because it really does read like a children's book (things I know are supposed to be revealed in the end were predictable because of foreshadowing). I would however recommend this to all children.
B0007TKNII|2.0|I have never seen the stage version of Phantom, nor have I read the book.  However, as a musician, I am somewhat familiar with the songs associated with Webber's masterpiece.  This film version simply did not cut the mustard.  Here's why: <br /> <br />The Phantom is all wrong.  I thought The Phantom was supposed to have an absolutely amazing voice.  Where was it in this movie?  Nonexistent.  Butler is out of his league when it comes to singing these songs, whatever qualifications he may have brought to the table.  Seriously, who did he sleep with to get cast in this role?  The actor that plays Raol out-sings him, and that is an atrocity.  The Phantom is also wrong in this movie because you like him too much.  His \\"creepy-factor\\" is not nearly high enough.  He's too nice, too handsome, not nearly menacing enough.  From my understanding, you are supposed to feel sorry for this pituful creature that happens to have a really bad temper.  Plus, we see far too much of The Phantom.  Couldn't Schumacher have played with the lighting better to obscure our view of him? <br /> <br />Next issue, the actress playing Christine.  What a beautiful girl.  Nice voice, but far from spectacular.  I thought she looked bored most of the movie, like she was going to fall asleep standing-up! <br /> <br />Minnie Driver managed to do a nice job playing the diva Carlotta.  Even though it is not her singing voice, she made the most of this obviously over-the-top character.  Well-played. <br /> <br />Raol.  Wow, he hardly got any screen time, but when he did, I found myself asking, \\"Why isn't he The Phantom?\\" because his voice is SO much better than Butler's.  Also, isn't Christine supposed to be torn between The Phantom and Raol?  I got no sense of conflict.  There was a total lack of this love triangle.  Plus, we have no reason to like this character.  Tragic lack of character development. <br /> <br />The sets were really well-done.  Costumes get an \\"A\\".  Editing was awful.  Chop, chop, choppy! <br /> <br />Overall, I think the movie was destined for failure from the beginning.  The only thing I could compare it to would be trying to re-write The Bible: you just DON'T DO IT.
B000002MP2|5.0|This is a classic album, a must have for anyone who is into the modern revival of punk. If you've heard the name \\"Green Day\\" and even let the entertained the idea of buying anything by Green Day for even a second, you should get this album. Green Day has found a great sound, catchy (hence the pop) yet as punk as it can get. The album is often funny, but angst-ridden (as punk should be).
0684853523|3.0|I wish I'd have read this Stephen King title before I wrote my first piece of published work.  This book helped me to overcome writer's block, which was caused by excessive plotting, and motivated me to begin working an a new novel. <br /> <br />The thing I found very disappointing was King's invitation for his readers to write six or seven pages about a scenario he outlined and email the work to him through his website.  He said he wouldn't respond to everyone, but he'd read them all.  I spent several hours doing so, and although it helped me as a writer, it bothered me to read his webmaster's response.  Basically, King didn't expect anyone to respond and doesn't fulfill his promise of reading them.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|There has been so much really going on in the field in R&B for music. Well, considering that there really hasn't been a real feeling of old school R&B these days. Well, since Alicia Keys came out in 2001 with the highly successful Songs In A Minor, many people have really felt the hunger for her great authentic reflections of good, down to Earth soul. Yet, while she has been able to stride, her music has also kept it going as well. The feeling has came with collaborations from Eve, to Usher, and others. While people like Britney Spears and Beyonce' can't have that in substance rather than style, Alicia Keys still has them both. That is well shown on her second record.<br /><br />The 2003 Diary Of Alicia Keys record, has a little more feeling of contemporary R&B / Hip Hop. The feeling on this record is a little bit more like Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway from the 70's. That is well matched within the songs on this record. The album includes so many great songs such as You Don't Know My Name, the orchestral hip hop masterpiece Karma, as well as other great songs like When You Really Love Someone, and the heartfelt Diary, with a reunited Tony! Toni! Tone!. The album is very well-recognized, even in the instrumentals like Feeling You, Feeling Me, and the opening track Harlem's Nocturne.<br /><br />While so many artists try to stride into the actual feeling of R&B right now, they haven't really reached that level Alicia Keys has made. If you haven't heard this record, give it a shot and experience the feeling Harlem's musical diary.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B 1/2+<br /><br />Mastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B
0780629450|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's \\"Hamlet\\" hits all the marks.  The acting is magnificent, the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous, the Oscar-nominated costumes and sets are stunning, and Patrick Doyle's score (also Oscar-nominated) is sensitive and moving.  Oh yeah - the screenplay, by some guy named Will S., isn't too bad either. Film critics ribbed Branagh for receiving the films' fourth Oscar nod for \\"adapting\\" the screenplay, but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one.  I can't think of many better ways to make four hours fly by. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, we'll have to wait until 2006 for a DVD release of Branagh's \\"Hamlet,\\" arguably the greatest Shakespearean adaptation ever filmed.  Hyperbole, you say?  Perhaps, but the superlatives are warranted.  Nearly every decision Branagh makes works brilliantly: the use of England's Blenheim Palace for exteriors, the Edwardian dress, and the staging of \\"To be or not to be\\" in a hall of mirrors, to name a few. This is a bold, ambitious, and successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare's language with equally eloquent imagery. <br /> <br />The casting of Hollywood luminaries such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor parts can be distracting, but that's nitpicking.  The principal cast excels: Derek Jacobi captures the conflicted nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet acutely depicts Ophelia's descent into madness; Julie Christie brings passion to her portrayal of Gertrude; Richard Briers is pitch-perfect as the conniving Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of Horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship.  Every speech, every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction; there isn't a wasted moment in the entire film. The final scenes magnify the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations. <br /> <br />If you can't wait for the DVD and are trying to decide which version of the VHS tape to buy, I strongly recommend the widescreen edition.  With a film of this ambition and scope, the differences between widescreen and full-frame are magnified.  For example, when Player King (Charlton Heston) is reciting his speech, there is a brilliant repartee between Hamlet and Polonius that is undermined in the reformatted version.  Instead of both actors sparring verbally within the frame, we get distracting cuts between Hamlet and Polonius, which disrupt the comic timing of the dialogue.  The widescreen version preserves the actors' reaction shots and thus the comedy. <br /> <br />In either version, \\"Hamlet\\" shines, but the widescreen version presents Branagh's masterpiece in its proper dimensions.  The DVD version won't arrive a moment too soon, and will hopefully restore this \\"Hamlet\\" to its full glory.
B0000C8AV2|5.0|It's great to see all the positive reviews for this CD.  I own about 90% of the Dylan catalogue and \\"Oh Mercy\\" is, in my opinion, Bob's most under rated CD.  An absolute masterpiece.
B0008ISM40|1.0|Nine inch nails- with teeth review.<br /><br /> I have been a nine inch nails fan for a long time now but I have to say honestly \\"I waited 6 years for this garbage?!?!?!\\"  In every single full length NIN C.D.  there has been a dominant emotion in the C.D. or a progression from one feeling to another but it all makes logical sense. This one there is not an emotion in the lyrics in the C.D. that is<br /><br />steady. I feel like I'm a manic depressant while I'm listening to this C.D. and some of the lyrics seemingly are not even trying to paint a larger picture to what Trent means.<br /><br />Here is a review of the songs themselves.<br /><br />All the love in the world-is a repetition of the lyrics \\"why do you get all the love in the world.\\"  Through out the whole song, which gets quite boring.  And the instrumental is quite mellow and drawn out with a bit of tambourine thrown into it. Quite a boring song.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />You know what you are? - This song is quite an up beat and fast past song compared to all the love in the world. All the lyrics are \\"don't you know what you are?\\" with a couple f bombs thrown into the lyrics. To maybe make it offensive or something. Sorry Trent this tactic doesn?t work with listeners over the age of 12 that are trying to shock their parents. I will finish this song review with this statement. No Trent I do know what I am why doing you tells me.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />The collector- This song has instrumentals that are quite boring once again. And they lyrics seem to paint a picture of a guy that collects other peoples feeling cause he does not have any of his own. Yep yep Trent nice try to get the anguish-ridden kids to love your music. 1/5<br /><br />The hand that feeds- this is the song that the radio has been playing to get you the listener to buy this C.D.  The music at first is quite boring. But picks up a little pace. So instrumentally it's decent. But the lyrics I cant understand<br /><br />bits and pieces so I wont write about them. Though there are a lot of lines. \\"Will you bite the hand that feeds you.\\" Though out the song.  1/5<br /><br />Love is not enough- the instimentals of this song is quite decent though does not hold a candle to any of the past work by this band. The lyrics seemingly are about trying to get a relationship to work but he finds out that it takes more<br /><br />then loves to hold a relationship together. Though I may be a bit off cause I got so bored with the lyrics that I started to play solitaire for entertainment.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />Every day is exactly the same- this song has some of the best layering of the C.D. Though once again I will say that it doesn?t hold a candle to past work by this band. The lyrics seemingly are about how everyday is the same. (No duh, I know)  and I did catch a lyric about how there is no love here, and there is no<br /><br />pain, you got to get though good and bad for love. 1/5<br /><br />With teeth- once again the title of this song you can?t forget cause it is repeated 50 million times though out the song. The incidentals seemingly go down hill also. 1/5<br /><br />Only- these songs lyrics make you think that Trent is an egocentric man. \\"There is no you there is only me.\\" There is a bunch of reference to himself also. The instrumentals are boring and the same chords are used over and over. Well thank<br /><br />you Trent for making an incredibly boring song about yourself. Maybe you should do what you sing. Hurt yourself instead us the listeners with horrid songs like this. 1/5<br /><br />Getting smaller-this song picks up the musical pace. The lyrics are about being a face in a crowd. And not having anything. Well sorry Trent I didn't realize no money went to you when I have spent so much money buying your merch. Ill next time I want to give you money ill mail it to you. 1/5<br /><br />Sunspots- the lyrics don't make sense. I understand some songs are not suppose to make sense so im not ducting points from my rating of the song. With old lyrics thrown into it. The instrumentals also don?t do much. Quite toned down and like the rest not interesting. I believe I will do what you say in this<br /><br />song. \\"Burn it up and spread the ashes around\\" this is what ill do to this C.D. and take the ashes to the 4 corners of the world because I don't want too much of this C.D. in one place. 1/5<br /><br />The line begins to blur- all ill say is the lyrics \\"the more I stay in here the more its not so clear the more I stay in here. The more I disappear.\\" Describe this song clearly cause im disappearing from the waking world and going to the<br /><br />napping world. 1/5<br /><br />Beside you in time- \\"n and on and on and on and on and on?.<br /><br />this goes on and on and on and on and on\\" These lyrics describe this song quite well. 1/5<br /><br />Right where it belongs- when this song opened up sounded like it may be the new hurt. But the song infact lets me down once<br /><br />again. I?m not going to even write a review of this song cause you know what ill<br /><br />say by now. 1/5<br /><br />Well I tallied up the full totals of the ratings of each song. And made a full total of this cd. It got 0.215 so I am forced to give this cd a review of 1/5. Though it pains me to give a NIN cd such a bad review. But im sorry Trent this is garbage.

0399241515|5.0|I bought the first four books and it took me a little while to finish each of them.  Maybe around a coupld of weeks to read one.  Then, my father bought me Scorpia 3 days ago (today being 5/10/2005) but I did not read it at all the first day.  Then, on the second day, I read a little over a third of the book it was so interesting.  That night, I had to stop reading at the beginning of a chapter or else I would flip out.  Yesterday I read until I had around 50 pages to go.  Today, I finished the book.  Three days compared to the other four which took 2-3 weeks.  They weren't NEARLY as heart-pounding, breath-taking, or suspenseful as Scorpia was.  There are so many parts in this book that you have to keep reading in order to understand; but by that time, there is something else you don't understand and have to keep reading in order to understand ad so on and so forth.  I reccomend this book to ANYBODY; you can like dramas, you can like slow stories, you can like childrens' books but in the end, you will LOVE this book.
6303109950|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining westerns ever made and as such, ranks right up there with \\"Shane,\\" \\"Open Range,\\" \\"Ride the Man Down\\" and Eastwood's \\"The Unforgiven.\\" It is a story of changing times that haven't quite changed enough. Kurt Russell gives his best performance as Wyatt Earp, coming to Tombstone with his brothers to settle down and put his lawman days behind him. Tombstone is a wild town still and a group known as The Cowboys and a young gunslinger named Johnny Ringo begin to make this impossible.<br /><br />Dana Delany is radiant as the actress Wyatt falls for even though he is married. His wife has become a drug addict and his marriage is not the stuff dreams are made of, but Dana Delaney is. The film takes its time as Wyatt and his brothers are slowly drawn towards the history we have come to know, and the aftermath we may not.<br /><br />This is a multilayered story more faithful to the truth than most versions. What makes this film superior to other westerns is the depth of the story and the realistic performances of the cast. The finest of the aforementioned is Val Kilmer's extraordinary turn as Doc Holliday.<br /><br />This film more realistically portrays the relationship of Holliday and Wyatt than any other film. Kilmer's Holliday is dangerous and intelligent, and above all, loyal to perhaps his only real friend in life, Wyatt Earp. Kilmer so became the real Doc Holliday that it was said he remained in character on the set at all times, even when the camera was not rolling. His performance is something that will always be remembered by anyone who watches this film.<br /><br />Wyatt is a real man in this film with raw courage but no self delusions. He is no gunman and realizes he can not beat the quick and dangerous Johnny Ringo in a gun battle. Doc Holliday, in spite of his illness, has Wyatt's back and arrives there first. What follows is one of the most tense and accurately portrayed gunfights in film history.<br /><br />Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp remained friends until Holliday finally was overtaken by the tuberculosis which had plagued him for years. As in real life, Wyatt Earp actually does find happiness and settles down with Dana Delaney after his wife dies in this film. The real Wyatt became quite wealthy in the latter part of his life.<br /><br />The rich tapestry of events that formed the legend of the dangerous Doc Holliday and Marshal Wyatt Earp are given the best and most accurate screen treatment ever filmed. This is a must see western. You will never forget it and you will never see a better and more colorful true to life performance than Val Kilmer's turn as Doc Holliday.y finally was overtaken by the tuberculosis which had plagued him for years.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I thought I'd add another five star review, because the amount of support for this show here thrills me.  As much as I like to trash Fox for bungling Firefly, in some ways I feel partly responsible for their mistake.  Because I felt the same way about the show early on: that it could never make it.  As a Buffy fan, I followed the story of the show a little.  I was amazed by Buffy's success, in itself.  I know that Joss originally pitched the show to Fox, amongst other networks I believe, before landing at the fledgling WB.  I was always glad Fox passed on the show, because even though it would've had greater production value, I don't think the show ever would've lasted long enough to become what it did.  I thought Firefly was doomed from the beginning, and so did Fox.  I also thought the show was too out there.  Sure, I'd give it a chance, but no one else would.  I didn't even catch that many episodes on TV, though.  I liked the show, but didn't love it, and then I'd miss it one week, and the next week it would be pre-empted for baseball, or something, so I caught less than half of the aired episodes.  I wasn't overly sad when the show was cancelled, because I thought it had been inevitable.  I ended up buying the DVD on a whim, and then I watched the pilot.  That was where Fox and I differed.  How could they not air this pilot?  It's probably the best episode in the series.  It's deliberate, yes, but that was required to introduce an ensemble cast of 9 characters, and there was still action and humor in it.  Watching the show through, I fell in love with it.  I couldn't believe I hadn't realized how great it was.  I had missed some of the best episodes, and watching them in order made others that I had seen better.  Joss's other shows started off somewhat slowly and awkwardly.  With Firefly, he had graduated college.  This show knew what it was from the first second, and it needed to, because it wouldn't have a second to waste getting comfortable.  Then, after being astonished by the show, I started reading some of the fan reviews here.  I read dozens, hundreds.  It was amazing.  I wasn't the only one who saw the brilliance here.  People connected with this show.  Lots of people.  I had never seen such a uniformity of 5-star reviews.  A lot of them weren't Buffy fans.  A lot of them had picked up the show without knowing a thing about it.  I couldn't believe it: the show hadn't been doomed from the start.  Amazingly, it could've had a chance.  It should've had a chance.  This show could have actually been a hit, as hard as that was to believe.  If Fox had put it on, I dunno, Wednesday night, and had promoted it, and given it a little time, amazing things could've happened.  Even as the story has went, it's still amazing.  The show HAS become a hit, even without being given time.  People have found it.  They're actually making a movie out of it with a $60 million budget.  I don't know how it happened.  It never seemed possible.  I thought Joss had to mess up sooner or later.  Not every show could be a hit.  But here he succeeded maybe more than ever before, even while failing.  Still, it depresses me.  Two hours on the big screen can never compare to even the half season we did get.  Why couldn't Fox have at least let them finish out the season.  Imagine what they could've accomplished in just one full season.  8 more episodes.  They could've done incredible things in those 8 episodes, because Joss knows how it works.  He knows characters.  He never casts vacant-eyed models, he goes for actors with an energy in them, and he writes characters the same.  There isn't a single character our of 9 that doesn't work on this show.  There isn't a single actor that's even a little bit wrong for the part.  As much as I like Buffy, this show had more of what it takes, in some ways, than Buffy did.  This show had a more fully realized universe that came together from the first episode.  And they hardly even got to explore it.
B00006FDCD|4.0|When IT first came out back in the mid 80s, it was one of my favorite books.  Even with its gargantuan size, King managed to hold my interest and I felt totally immersed in the tiny town of Derry and the seven youngsters who carried the weight of the book on their shoulders.  I first saw the movie adaptation when it aired as a mini-series on TV and although I found it quite good, its \\"tacky\\" spider ending and the miscasting of the adults kept it from being the classic I would have liked to see.  Viewing it again now, some fifteen years later, I found it more enjoyable without all the commercial breaks and having to wait a night to see the next episode.  What makes IT such a refreshing horror novel/movie is its focus on friendship, something King captures beautifully, particularly when the characters are kids.  Kids nowadays would never know the joy of forming a secret club, building a dam, or binding together to face the usual bullies of childhood.  The young actors are superb:  the late Jonathan Brandis (he committed suicide in 2003) as Bill; Emily Perkins (Brigitte in the Ginger Snaps series), and Ben Heller as young Ben are especially good.  Unfortunately, when casting the adults, the producers opted to go for familiar TV faces (Richard Thomas, John Ritter, Tim Reid, Harry Anderson) or actors from B-movies (Dennis Christopher of Fade to Black), and these guys just didn't fill the adult shoes as convincingly as I would have liked.  Annette O'Toole (One on One) does do a good job as the adult Beverly, and Olivia Hussey adds some British class in her small role as Thomas' wife.  But Thomas seemed to be an adult version of his John Boy Walton and Anderson, Reid and Ritter overacted shamelessly.  Some of the special effects early on are quite good but the spider at the end is just not menacing or convincing enough, so the movie loses a lot of momentum there.  But IT is still a worthwhile three hours, and I recommend if you haven't read the book, do yourself a favor and read it.  King is superb in the capturing of childhood friendships.d read it.  King is superb in the capturing of childhood friendships.
B00030GMO0|5.0|Let's see, where to start...hmmm... So i picked this disc up last year about this time and have had ample time to think, reflect, and appreciate the sheer bada$$ness of this album.  I mean it really is that good.  Not to mention that I saw them live last night and they performed not 10 feet from my face.  They were tight live, and I don't mean 'yo tight dawg' I mean they were true to form, they played well and they gave the crowd exactly what they came for.  Now I know, I know, there are the usual claims against this album, this band, and this 'genre' of music in general that this scene is over saturated and exhausted but in my opinion this CD is worthy of the attention that it's been getting on any number of levels.  Tracks 1 through 4 absolutely smoke.  \\"All these things that I have done\\", song 5, at first seemed like a waste of time and I will admit that but then after a few listens you'll realize that it's a nice pace adjustment and really helps set the tone for the rest of the album with the exception of \\"Midnight Show\\" which was a great choice for the concert's opener and is a record I feel could stand alone as a single with out a doubt.  Either way you spin it this CD is loads of fun to listen through, it's a great first effort from a group who has uncapped potential and will enjoy critical and commercial success in the years to come.
0142000655|5.0|Desire is at the threshhold but you can master it.  When the cards have been stacked against you can still manage to sweep the pot.  Steinbeck's craftsmanship is only exceeded by his ability to find the nut of the issue and crack it wide open for all of us to partake of it's nutty fruit.  His best.
B000929AJQ|3.0|First off, this album isn't half as bad as most people are saying it is. It isn't the best either. I have never been a big NIN fan but I like this album. Some of the highlights are The Hand That Feeds, Beside You in Time and You Know Who You Are? This album is a little lacking compared to The Fragile, but it is still a damn good album. I would recommend it only to diehard NIN fans because anyone else would not understand the music and therefore think that it sucks.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I know there are Spider-man fans out there who probably didn't like the changes in the movie but not being a huge fan myself, loved it.  Sam Raimi is king and shows us why in both action, direction, and special effects.  AWESOME!

B00003CXPJ|1.0|I could give a lengthy review of how God-awful this movie was but I won't because I won't give anymore time to this pukefest of a waste of time it is to begin with.  Ben Stiller must have had to pay on his beach house.   YUCK!  total drek!
0679731377|4.0|Unlike most reviewers of this novel, I hadn't heard of Julian Barnes until I read \\"The Lemon Table: Stories,\\" a quirky, diverse and elegant compliation of stories.  This novel is as varied, and it reads more like essays on mythic and eternal principles, such as creation, love and afterlife.  I agree with some of the reviewers that ceratain of the stories/essays are astonishingly profound and well written and others are simplistic and tedious.  That said, however, Julian Barnes is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors.  This is a must read.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|It's hard to believe The Matrix Revolutions is a conclusion to the 1999 film, The Matrix.  What began as a ground-breaking epic four years prior ends with a subpar action flick, discarding many of the elements that made the original the smart, slick film it's still regarded as today. <br /> <br />The first major problem with Revolutions is that it's NOT A DIRECT SEQUEL TO RELOADED.  It isn't!  The Wachowski Brothers apparently decided that their game, Enter the Matrix, should serve as a link between the two films, so there are a few things going on at the beginning of Revolutions that seem to follow Reloaded, but make no sense if you didn't play the game.  This is a clever marketing ploy, but as far as delivering the story, it's not very smart; fortunately, it isn't TOO important to what's going on, so the questions will end long before the movie takes off. <br /> <br />I've watched a lot of films with action sequences so intense I wish they'd never end.  The Matrix Revolutions seems to be trying to fulfill that wish here, except it's not done very well.  The epic battle with the sentinels over Zion is very, VERY intense, but it goes on so long and without interruption you may find yourself looking at your watch, wondering when the actual story's going to come back.  And when it does...well, sometimes you get the feeling you know why they spent more time on the battle sequences. <br /> <br />In short, the end result is a film that's so cliche, choppy, and overblown that you feel they placed most of the focus on special effects, which are impressive, but nothing extraordinary.  Purists will probably wish this film never existed; at the very least, it's an intense action flick that \\"wraps up\\" the conflict presented in the original.
1401200605|5.0|While the story line of \\"Hush\\" is merely so-so, it's the art that really makes this book shine.  Each character is an amazing depiction, and most of the big names are in here.  Between Hush 1 & 2, you've got Batman (duh), Superman, Joker, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Catwoman, Harley, Nightwing...the list goes on and on.  Each one of these characters \\"feels\\" how they should (well, Riddler is a bit weak), and the dialogue between them is dead-on.<br /><br />Still, it's the artwork that sells.  The scenes in the Batcave are particularly good, with the glow from screens casting eerie illuminations, and reflections seen in the glass.  My only complaint is that the Joker (my favorite character) is drawn REALLY exaggerated.  I realize that the guy is far from normal looking, but I still prefer the understated styles of someone like Alex Ross.  The bottom line is, even with the over-the-top Joker, the rest of the art is so good, that it more than makes up for it.<br /><br />If you prefer eye-candy over a good storyline, definitely look in to \\"Hush.\\"
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Twenty years from now, the only reason 'Closer' will be remembered is because it represents Natalie Portman's first 'adult' role.  The Golden Globes got it right: she and Clive Owen dominate the proceedings here, lording over supposed leading lights Julia Roberts and Jude Law.  With Owen, it's even more impressive when you consider that he played Law's character in the original London play.<br /><br />Under Mike Nichols' direction, 'Closer' is about as close a thing to a play on screen as you're ever going to see.  Only six characters are credited, and in fact characters five (taxi driver) and six (secretary) have one line apiece.<br /><br />I do have to credit Nichols for a wonderfully imagined beginning - the scene of Law and Portman eyeing each other on the street for the first time (in super slo-mo) with Damien Rice's \\"Blower's Daughter\\" essentially narrating the scene is an unsurpassed cinematic moment.
B00063MBU8|4.0|I don't mean the rest songs are bad,but this one-\\"Untitled\\" is so outstanding.I wasn't a SP fan before,even I've heard their previous singles,and maybe like them but just a little.And you know here in China,this CD isn't released,the hit singles\\"Shut Up\\"&\\"Welcome To My Life\\"just didn't make me buy this CD,you know an import.Till I heared their lastest single \\"Untitle\\",so unluckily, I didn't notice this song before,and then I went out and bought this CD,althought a Japan-import's price is about five-fold as much as a China-made CD is,but it's worth,anyway,the other songs aren't bad.Is that punk or what,who cares,just buy it!
B00003CX5P|1.0|The year was 1999 and i was 14. I had been anxiously awaiting for this movie to come out in theaters. I even remember once buying a ticket to get into the movie just to see the trailer for Episode 1 \\"The Phantom Menace\\" and then leave.The hype for this movie was in full swing, i saw all of the commotion on the TV and the newspapers, fans all over the country camping out side of movie theaters to crazed fans dressed up as their favorite SW character. When the day finally came and saw it, i was horrified. It was esentially a giant cartoon with \\"STAR WARS\\" plastered on it, i felt sick, it was the biggest letdown in my life. I can't go into everything that was just completely and utterly wrong with this movie, the list would be too long, although i feel compelled to mention a few of them anyway.With episode 3 looming near us, it reminded me of when i first saw episode 1 in thearters and almost cried when i left the venue, thinking that the immortal STAR WARS franchise was going to die if the episode 2 was going to be this bad, and 3 years later in may of 2002, to my horror, it was even worse then the first. when i think of these new prequils, down fall of a legacy comes to mind, how something as great as STAR WARS could be reduced to absolute crap with these prequils. Where do i begin? The first thing is that you essentialy have no acting in here, what made the original great was you hade characters you actually cared about, and most of all you had a defined villian, not this Darth Maul fag who looked like a guy pulled out of a B sci fi flick and had about 6 minutes of screen time. Another thing that REALLY killed me was Jake Loyde... i know he is a little kid, but C'MON! YIPEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF!? Liam Neeson's character could of  been developed a lot more, but Lucas failed at that as well. The most bogus thing was the whole mediclorian blood count thing,a way to measure how attuned to the force a human being is, in other words, how powerful they are. I can't tell you how utterly retarded that concept was, as originaly, the force was supposed a spiritual aspect that was mastered through training and disiplin, not a effing genetic predisposition, this is STAR WARS, not Dragon Ball Z! LET ME CHECK YOU POWER LEVEL VEGETA! WHOA! MY SCOUTER JUST EXPLODED FROM YOUR AWESOME INCREASE IN POWER! The pod race was equaly bad, just imagine NASCAR, only 1000 times worse with a certain comedy vaule to it, which brings me to another point; this movie is more likely going to make you p i $ $ yourself laughing then actually make you take it seriously. Jar Jar alone would of ruined this movie, never mind the acting, or the fact that this is simply one of the worst movies ever made. This movie was what started the wound in the STARWARS franchise, Epiosode 2 was the infection, who knows how bad 3 will be, because they have become progressivly worse, maybe it will be simular to the doctor telling you that your HIV positive. <br /> <br />As i said in another STAR WARS review, these movies can only be enjoyed if you look at them from a pure comedic aspect instead of actually thinking of it as a serious installment in the STAR WARS fracchise.
1401206905|5.0|Batman is a character I've always enjoyed, but I've only recently started getting into the Batman comics.  After reading Frank Miller's exceptional \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\" graphic novel, I really wanted to acquire more Batman comics that depicted the characters in a similar manner:  as deep, well-thought-out characters that you really feel emotionally attached to by the end of the story.  The problem was that, being new to comics, I was tossed into a sea of nearly endless Batman comics, and I didn't really know where to begin. <br /> <br />Well, where better to start than at the very beginning? <br /> <br />Batman: Year One is the story of Batman's first year in Gotham City after returning from training abroad, making it the perfect book for someone unfamiliar with Batman's origins, or just looking for a fresh take on the classic story.  But the book is as much about the origins of Jim Gordon, who will later become the famed police commissioner of Gotham City, as it is about Batman's beginning.  The story hinges on Gordon's attempts to clean up a police force that is corrupt to its very core, and his encounters with the Batman that finally lead up to a climactic confrontation that brings both men together in their fight against crime. <br /> <br />Firse of all, the packaging and presentation of the story is top-notch.  The book is hard bound and comes with a very nice partial sleeve that makes it look very classy.  The cover itself depicts a simple black and white drawing of Batman that is quite effective for portraying what the book is about.  Each chapter of the story opens with the origin comic book cover from each issue, and they are very vivid and clean.  There are many extras, from an amusing illustrated afterword by the artist, David Mazzuccelli, and many pages of preliminary and promotional artwork.  In the end, I felt that some of these features could have probably been dropped in favor of a slightly lower price tag, but they are nice additions that give the book a more \\"deluxe edition\\" feel. <br /> <br />The artwork in the story is very good.  I really like David Mazzuccelli's style.  He's really not entirely different from Miller himself in that his artwork isn't terribly elaborate, but is supremely effective in telling a story.  Mazzuccelli really has a strength when it comes to facial expressions.  You can really see how the characters feel by the looks on their faces, particularly in the more emotional spots of the book.  The backgrounds and characters are beautiful, though, and the colors are very nice and vivid.  The artwork brilliantly aids in telling the dark story of Batman's birth and Gordon's struggles. <br /> <br />The storyline is nothing short of superb as well.  I've held Frank Miller in high regard ever since reading \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", and this book is written in a very similar style.  You can tell that Miller really likes using internal monologues to convey the thoughts and feelings of the characters, and they are very effective and give the story a depth that other comics don't have.  The story progresses logically and is very readable.  It's a great retelling of the familiar story of Batman's beginning infused with an almost literary style. <br /> <br />Miller is an expert at characterization.  I was amazed at how much depth and likeability he could give even minor characters.  A character that I found myself sympathizing with and surprisingly liking is Gordon's wife Barbara.  With only powerful artwork and a few lines, I felt that she was portrayed very powerfully and believably, making her a great character that further enhances the personality and depth of Gordon.  You can tell that Miller really likes Jim Gordon, as he is given more characterization than anyone else in the story.  I really felt connected to the character by the end of the story, because he is so remarkably human, and not totally unlike myself.  He makes mistakes, but he is in the end a good person, and I thinkthis is what makes him so appealing, perhaps even more than Batman himself.  This is not to say that the characterization of Batman is lacking in the story; quite the contrary, in fact. Bruce Wayne is also portrayed as a man who has his fair share of problems that he is trying to overcome in his never-ending fight to purge Gotham of corruption.  The deep characterizations are what really make this book shine. <br /> <br />The only gripe I have with the storyline and characterizations is a subplot involving Catwoman in the story.  While she is brilliantly portrayed, I ended up feeling as if her role in the story didn't have much meaning other than to set her up as a potential romantic interest of Batman in the future as well as a recognized rogue and thief.  But her actions have relatively little bearing on where the story goes.  The subplot is still enjoyable, and in the end it doesn't detract from the overall greatness of the storyline. <br /> <br />Some may be disappointed by the utter lack of classic Batman villains in the story.  There is no Joker, no Two-Face, no Riddler, no Scarecrow, no one.  Instead, Batman fights criminals that don't seem very different from the ones we find in real life.  He is combating thugs and the corruption at the heart of the Gotham City:  the politicians and police officers that are on the take and are part of the problem instead of the solution.  I felt this gave the comic more credibility, but some will undoubtedly be disappointed that Batman isn't fighting one of his famous and colorful enemies.  In fact, the only mention of one such villain in the entire book is in the very last panel on the very last page of the very last chapter. <br /> <br />The only major problem I have with the overall graphic novel is that it is short.  The story itself is only around ninety pages.  But they are a great ninety pages, and you won't be disappointed with them.  But you will be left wishing that the story wouldn't end, making the length of the story the comic's greatest shortcoming. <br /> <br />This graphic novel is definitely a must-have for Batman fanatics, and I would heartily recommend it to people who are new to the world of Batman.  After all, what better way is there to get into the world of the Dark Knight than by reading the story of where it all began?
B000005RFQ|4.0|This album is definatly better then what people give it credit for. I was surprised at how great it was when i first listened to it way back when. When i was getting into Black Sabbath albums, people told me to stay away from it because it was criminaly labled as one of their weakest efforts. I must say that this is the most heavy, energetic album Black Sabbath has put out, ever. Ian Gillian was an interesting proposition for being picked to sing, he works out just fine here, maybe better then Dio in most respects(even if he doen't think so himself). Did people also forget that this was a chart toper as well? it was like, what, #3 on the charts back in 83? i might be off a little, but close anyway. This supposabley inspired Spinal Tap, but i don't know about that, the music here is not at all funny,clishe or obnoxious like Tap, it is pure evil heavy metal! Here are my ratings: <br /> <br />TRASHED 10/10 <br />STONEHENGE 6/10 <br />DISTURBIBG THE PREIST 10/10 <br />THE DARK 8/10 <br />ZERO THE HERO 10/10 <br />DIGITAL BITCH 9/10 <br />BORN AGAIN 9/10 <br />HOT LINE 10/10 <br />KEEP IT WARM 9/10 <br /> <br />I also the the music video for TRASHED, which i thought was horriblely directed but atleast we got to see the band playing in some of it. The reason i gave it four stars is because i wish there was just a little bit more material here, kind of like when you eat something good but are still hungry at the end. They definatly could of put The Fallen as a bonus track here, kind of like how castle included EVIL WOMAN on the reissue of the debut album. It is a tough to find album as well, since you can only get it as an import, there is no domestic pressing of this. If your music stores don't carry imports, then they won't have it.
B00000HYXB|5.0|this is a truely briliant album, start to finish.  <br /> <br />songs with such originlity and scope. truely great <br /> <br />i love this band and this CD,  <br /> <br />10/10 all the way.
B000002JOH|2.0|I could never understand the fasination behind Pantera. They were average at best, c'mon, stop this foolishness! They put out COWBOYS FROM HELL which was alright and then this album which had a couple good songs and that's it, all of the rest of their stuff is pretty insipid! It is amazing how many fans these guys had, even more amazing that all of their \\"HaRdCorE Bad@$$\\" fans didn't realize that they made pop metal in the 80's a la Def Leppard style before deciding to ripoff New orleans thrash act Exhorder. God, if i was Kyle Thomas (Exhorder's lead singer) right now, i would be steaming mad.Panterible put them out of a job! Panterible commited a crime, they stole the fame that should off been Exhorder's, not Panterible's, tell me that Phil Anselmo doesn't sound like a sorry @$$ed ripoff of Kyle Thomas? Exhorder only got to make two albums before they disolved, while Panterible went on to become tough guy mallcore metal. God these guys suck! and whats worse is they weren't even original! I rather be a horrible band that atleast had it's own sound(Korn for example) then a poser group like Panterible that had to rip someone elses original sound off to get where they are now. OK, so Dimebag was killed, that is a shame, no one should have to die for something as stupid as what happened on that tragic night, but still, people are now calling him \\"legendary\\". I had to laugh at that, he was good, not legendary, Criss Oliva was legendary, not this hick.People must be complete idiots to seriously think that he was some kind of guitar god, or their just trying to be nice now that he passed away.  <br /> <br />Please, pick up Exhorder's SLAUGTHER IN THE VATICAN and THE LAW and see where Panterible ripped it's sound off from.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, or what type of music you listen to, Green Day's American Idiot will come as a brilliant piece of artwork should you give it a playthrough. Quite honestly when I think about it, I can't think of a single bad song on the entire album. Another surprise that comes to head when you listen is that this entire album consists of a surprisingly detailed storyline about the Jesus of Suburbia. I think I'll just write out a review for each song individually, it's easier for people that way. <br /> <br /> <br />1. American Idiot - 7.5/10 <br />It wouldn't be my choice as a single. I don't particularly like this song. <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia - 10/10 <br />The first of two \\"rock opera\\"s on the CD, and a brilliant piece of art. This one will get you hooked. <br /> <br />3. Holiday- 10/10 <br />One of the best songs on the album. Happy, upbeat, smart lyrics and good music in general makes this song just...great. <br /> <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams - 10/10 <br />It's been overplayed for a reason, folks: it's amazing. <br /> <br />5. Are We the Waiting? - 8/10 <br />Good, but not Green Day's best. <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy - 9/10 <br />A fun quick song, different then most other stuff on the CD. <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novacaine - 8/10 <br />I want to like this song... I really do. But it's slow and just doesn't keep me interested. Great chorus, though. <br /> <br />8. She's a Rebel - 10/10 <br />If Green Day has another single, this should be it (Or Letterbomb... Or Whatsername...). This song is a great choice to represent the entire album. The chorus of it is just amazing. Easily one of the most catchy songs on the album. <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl - 8.5/10 <br />Good song, starts off slow with drums, but picks up and it's pretty fun to listen to. <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb- 10/10 <br />Everyone loves this song. It's basically a letter from Whatsername to the Jesus of Suburbia, saying in effect that she's going to leave him. The guitar playing and the vocals and drums fit together great. Near the end of the song, Billy Joe sings out  some of the most emotional lyrics in the entire song: \\"She said I can't take this place, I'm leaving it behind/ She said I can't take this town, I'm leaving you tonight\\", and when you hear them followed up by the crazy ending, you'll see what people are talking about. <br /> <br />11. Wake me up When Sept. Ends - 9/10 <br />A nice slow song that's in tribute to September 11th. Eventually picks up with the electric guitar though - they couldn't leave it for a full song ;) <br /> <br />12 Homecoming - 10/10 <br />My second favorite song on the album, this is a great song all around. Starts out with a distorted guitar riff, then goes into song and never lets down for a full nine minutes. You can just keep on listening to this song over and over and over... it never gets old. <br /> <br />13. Whatsername- 10/10 <br />Aaah, Whatsername. My favorite song on the album. Starts out slow, but eventually picks up with the electric guitars and really turns into an amazing piece. Better then that, it has some emotional lyrics about his (Jesus's) lost love, Whatsername. A brilliant way to end a brilliant album. <br /> <br />Closing comments: If you haven't gotten this album, you must get it. You are missing out on some really amazing stuff here. Oh yeah, and as another reviewer noticed, it's easy to spot the \\"American Idiots\\"... just look at reviewers that rated one star.
B000001FTD|5.0|Anthrax unleased this monster of a album on the unsuspecting public in 1987. Many fans would probably agree that this is by far the absolute peak of Anthrax's creative and musical genius. I myself would agree, since i have worn-out at least 4 copys of this album from repeated listenings. This was were Anthrax found themselves after a generic \\"Spreading The Dieses\\",unfortuanatly \\"State Of Euphoria\\" wasn't so good. <br /> <br />The first thing is that this album has the coolest cover art ever(that is if you are a Stephen King fan like i am), a illustration of Randall Flagg in the middle of a crowd of faceless people, just smiling.If you have ever read The Stand by Stephen King, you will know that he is one of the most evil characters in modern fictional literature. That was one of the things i have always liked about the guys in Anthrax, while their contemporarys were writing about gruesome subjects (like Slayer and Megadeth namely), these guys wrote songs about pop-culture, movies/books/people that they liked and some things that they hated. This album has all of that and more, some of the most clever song subjects and lyrics call this album home, and it is all put to the best thrash(w/ a dash of hardcore)you will hear in your life. The album kicks of with the title track which lyrically is inspired by The Stand from Stephen King, going from a haunting crawl to an all out thrash fest. CAUGHT IN A MOSH is one of thier most famous songs, it argueabley invented the term \\"mosh\\" and moshpits. I AM THE LAW is one of my all time favorites! they decided that they needed to write a song about the exploits of the bands favorite comic book character, DUDGE DREDD. I gotta tell you that Dredd is one of my all time favorite characters, and this song makes me estatic. N.F.L.(EFILNEKUFESIN) was venting anger over the death of comedian legend John Belushi. SKELETON IN THE CLOSET is another Stepen King song, based on his novella Apt Pupil. INDIANS is the first song where the band tried to tackel a world issue, in this case, the treatment of Native Americans by the U.S. goverment. This is IMHO the best song Anthrax ever wrote, just listen to the chorus and the power of Joe Bellodonna's voice on this, add to that, that Joe is of Native American decent and it only adds to the songs genuiness. ONE WORLD is another serious song, although it's lyricaly a bit dated. It was an attack on Ronald Reagan and his policies, but one could easily apply this to the idiot in the oval office right now. After all of the awesome songs on this album which almost plays out like a greatest hits, the only complaint i have (a minor one at that) is that it ends on a rather bland note. A.D.I./HORROR OF IT ALL is 7 minutes of pure filler, i listen to that hypnotic acoutic intro, then skip it. IMATATION OF LIFE had potential but let me down. Even though the last two tracks are duds, that does not diminish the power of AMOUNG THE LIVING in the least bit. This is simpley one of the greatest things i have listened to in my life. When people name greatest thrash albums of all time, some will say \\"Reign in Blood\\", others \\"Peace Sells\\", most say \\"Master of Puppets\\" and a minority will say \\"Bonded by Blood\\", but i always think AMOUNG THE LIVING when the mention of the gendre comes up, to me, this is the essential thrash album. All of the songs are fist pumping, with angry shout-outs to boot, its got that essence of hardcore in it as well, mainly because of Charlie Benante's drumming and the backing vocals.I was disapointed with the follow up STATE OF EUPHORIA, which sounded like a watered down version of ATL, and don't even get me started on that clown John Bush. The thing is that i think that all of their other albums are just average to this, it has kind of spoiled me to the rest of Anthrax's music, oh well!  <br /> <br />Get this if you know whats good for you! I brought this over to my freind Tony's place, and he S H I T  a brick when he heard it. This was much differant from his standard rotaion stack of Pantera,Whitezombie/Rob zombie,Static X and Manson. I tell you that fans were born that day!   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002AP1|3.0|This is better than the original issue, but still very tame and bubble-gummy compared to the true original recordings. <br /> <br />I know that sounds like a Comic Book Guy claim, but you have to hear the original to understand. <br /> <br />The true original recordings were issued as \\"Rough Power\\" several years ago (Bomp records, I believe) and only if you hear THAT disc will you understand why studio execs were frightened enough to get Bowie (who I consider the best pop musician of the '70s) to tone it down. <br /> <br />Rough Power remains one of the few albums of the era that's still fresh, unique, and worth listening to.  Hunt it down if you can.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|While Bill Murray will likely never be known as being a mega-successful actor in drama films, he takes another crack at it in this current movie.  He plays a beyond-middle-aged movie star who is getting paid millions to do advertisements for a Japanese whisky company.  Fittingly, they want to do the marketing work in Japan.<br /><br />While there he comes across a lovely young 20-something girl (Scarlett Johansson) who is staying in his hotel.  The two kick off a highly unlikely friendship that is the centerpoint of the plot.  Both are married but a bit lonely in their relationships.  Both dislike Japan, but enjoy each others company.  From spending time together they begin to actually relish their time spent in the foreign land.<br /><br />Having lived in Japan for a few years myself, I found the movie especially nostalgic.  I could relate to much of the culture shock depicted as I went through it myself.  There is nothing so helpless as being surrounded by people who do not speak the same language as you do.<br /><br />To be sure, this is a film that meanders a bit.  It is not a tight, cohesive story.  Rather, it does leave some loose ends, basically offering speculations on final outcomes to the viewer of the DVD.  This is not necessarily bad, but a lot of people may not like it.  In short, the film is more in an impressionistic mode than a storytelling mode.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, the #1 reason to pick this movie up is the performance of Scarlett Johansson.  Her demure, subtle beauty & character steals the show away from the great Bill Murray.  She is so docile and seems so innocent that you will want to hug her!<br /><br />Also, while I'm normally not a huge fan of Rock Videos in the bonus features, the one on this DVD did capture the essence of what the movie was \\"about.\\"  It showed Ms. Johansson walking the streets of Tokyo in a daze that made me think of Lewis Carrol's ALICE IN WONDERLAND.<br /><br />So, here is the bottom line:  if you like movies that depict Romantic (or pseudo-Romantic?) escapades to foreign lands, this one might be worth checking out.  It is well done and, like a good song, difficult to get out of your head after you've seen it.u like movies that depict Romantic (or pseudo-Romantic?) escapades to foreign lands, this one might be worth checking out.

B0008ISM40|5.0|This album has been in my CD player since I bought it last week, and it gets better with each listen. Thank God Trent is  back! Much respect to him for making an album with 'catchy' songs, even if it meant taking criticism for it not being typical NIN. I don't know who can listen to 'All the love in the world' or 'Sunspots' (or of course, 'the hand that feeds') without getting them stuck in their head for days. I can't wait for the next album...
B000002L7R|4.0|Yes, Prince was one of the biggest stars in popular music back in 1984. With the project, \\"Purple Rain\\", both the film and classic soundtrack, he was able to go completely mainstream. Everything about the project was phenomenal: the fashion, the sound, the style, and most importantly, the music. But, the following year, Prince just had to push the envelope. The album, \\"Purple Rain\\" was still on the charts, selling millions of copies; but everyone wanted a sequel. Everyone who enjoyed \\"Purple Rain\\" and were expecting a sequel got \\"Around The World in a Day\\". When I first listened to this album, I asked myself if Prince had a bad acid trip. The trippy album art was equivalent to The Beatles' 1967 recording, \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", the production was more glossy, and his sound was just completely different. It just wasn't raw and edgy anymore. The title track, \\"Around The World in a Day\\" is a middle-eastern like song with him doing a quirky meditation. \\"Paisley Park\\", which is named after his recording studio, is a psychedelic-utopian track with Prince doing a lot of strange, yet emotional imagery. \\"Condition Of The Heart\\" is probably one of Prince's best ballads. The song starts with a brief, symphonic sound bite and then it goes into an infectious piano line, with him singing some touching lyrics about a girl that is in love. \\"Rasberry Beret\\" is one of those songs everyone should at least recognize on this album. It's one of those commercial-sounding campfire songs with everything you would love in a pop song, and the special part about it is that he mixes some Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds influences with his sound and creates a brilliant piece of art. He also sings some funny, yet weird imagery in the song. It's just the climax of the album. \\"Tambourine\\" is a drum-inspired, funk jam. \\"America\\" is a quirky political cut with him talking about America's negative issues. The song sounds a lot like a James Brown tune, with its pounding drum machine patterns and wailing guitars sounds. \\"Pop Life\\" is another political cut, but this one is a little more introspective. To me, it's a song about how negative poverty really is, as he covers and talks about everything from drugs to fashion. \\"The Ladder\\" sounds like a gospel tune with Prince talking about how to reach heaven. Wendy and Lisa shares most of the vocals with Prince, over a lighthearted beat. The last track, \\"Temptation\\" is probably the strangest song on the album. He has a steaming, hot conversation with God, that just makes this whole cut notorious. Overall, the album, Around The World in a Day\\" was an experiment. With this album, he took the riskest challenge in mixing his sound to the 1960's pyschedelia sound. No one in the 1980's had ever heard an album so creative and unique, that just showed an influential artist doing something different. It was a backlash to many fans who loved the stunning \\"Purple Rain\\" album, but it was a tremendous effort. It is definitely worth a listen (especially if you have a good pair of quality headphones). B+
B000089RVX|5.0|Let me put it this way; I HATE ROCK. <br />I'm a violinist, and until i heard this album, I thought all rock was just messy and rude and terrible. <br />Then, i had so many people reccomend this CD that I finally checked it out from the library.  <br />And oh my gosh.  <br />It's so moving; Amy Lee's voice is just so different.  <br />I actually broke down and started crying during My Immortal. <br />Definately worth buying.
0060763280|5.0|What's funny as I read the negative reviews below are the people writing them are still not rich and unhappy - you can just tell from the tone.  They want it handed to them and not work to get it!  They obviously didn't get the meaning out of the book and are close-minded enough to not be able to see past their own stubborness and inabilty to receive new ideas.  Take for example one of the main principles of not blaming and complaining - look at their reviews!  They just don't get it!  hahaha! <br /> <br />This is probably the most priceless book I have read.  Thanks Harv.  Wish there were more people like you out there to help emulate successful people. <br /> <br />I urge you all to imagine the person writing the negative review.  It's like the emotional stalker who just doesn't get it.
B00005HYHC|5.0|Actually if I were going to go beyond the idea of a concept album with \\"The Wall\\" I would be more inclined to call it an oratorio, similar to Jethro Tull's \\"Thick as a Brick\\" or \\"Passion Play,\\" rather than a rock opera like \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" or the Who's \\"Tommy.\\" That is because the over riding unity of the songs in \\"The Wall\\" is thematic rather than narrative in nature. The bleak double album is Roger Waters' meditation on the walls human beings build up to ensure their survival in the post-modern world. It is also something of a departure from the group's previous albums, most notably \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" it that the group's signature cosmic rock sound is giving way to some more traditional pop music sensibilities. The compelling electronics and other special effects that had become key components of Pink Floyd's music, and which put \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" on the chart for literally years, now takes a back seat to the themes and lyrics (although there are still some choice moments, such as when Gomer Pyle shows up on \\"Nobody Home\\").<br /><br />The \\"story,\\" such as it is, concerns a rock star named Pink (no subtlety here, boys and girls), who is disgusted with the lesser human being he has become as a result of his celebrity. The key song in the album is \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (co-written by lead guitarist Dave Gilmour), which is one of the classic rock songs about alienation, although obviously the title begs to have it labeled a song about intoxication by the drug on your choice. But the context for lyrics such as \\"You are only coming through in waves/Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying\\" is clearly about the despair of being disconnected from humanity. It is also a lament about the lose of childhood, which remains in Waters' vision the time when we are at our best as human beings:<br /><br />When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse<br /><br />Out of the corner of my eye<br /><br />I turned to look but it was gone<br /><br />I cannot put my finger on it now<br /><br />The child is grown, the dream is gone<br /><br />I have become comfortably numb<br /><br />The music for \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is both operatic and eerie, a paradox that is nonetheless accurate. The relentlessly depressing picture of a rock star's life would have you worrying about the mental health of Roger Waters if it were not for the suspicion he is writing as much about the life in general and former Pink Floyd lead guitarist and main songwriter Syd Barrett as it is an attempt at catharsis by Waters after spitting on a fan during a concert for daring to applaud during an acoustic number. I always was struck by the start of \\"Mother,\\" with one of the very best examples of a caesura with the extremely effective pause between the first line, \\"Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?\\" and the second, \\"Mother, do you think they'll like this song?\\" There is a world of meaning in the vocal silence there that I have never forgotten.<br /><br />There are two pitfalls to \\"The Wall.\\" The first is that Pink Floyd released a rare single with \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2,\\" which mean that school children rebelling against the system now had something to sing throughout the year while waiting for the end of the year to do Alice Cooper's \\"Schools Out.\\" Consequently, in the popular consciousness \\"The Wall\\" was boiled down to the following potent lyrics:<br /><br />We don't need no education<br /><br />We don't need no thought control<br /><br />No dark sarcasm in the classroom<br /><br />Teachers leave them kids alone<br /><br />Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!<br /><br />All in all it's just another brick in the wall.<br /><br />All in all you're just another brick in the wall.<br /><br />Yet taken in its totality it can hardly be said that the primary purpose of this double-album was an attack on the educational system in England. In song after song the \\"character\\" is blaming others for his troubles, soit is not surprising that teachers end up on that list. But the success of the single made it seem this was what the whole thing was all about. For that matter, there are more songs concerned with the threat of nuclear destruction (\\"Mother,\\" \\"Goodbye Blue Skies\\") than education. By the time you through Waters' paranoia over Great Britain becoming fascist (\\"Run Like Hell\\") the whole indictment of education seems like just another, well, you know what (which would be the point, right?).<br /><br />The second concern is that the disparity between the highs and lows on this album are rather substantial. It is rather like sitting through an opera and some of recitatives (e.g., \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\") to get to the arias (e.g., \\"Hey You\\"). The best tracks on this album are as pretty good, but you still have to sit through some less than stellar sections (e.g., \\"One of My Turns\\"). The loose narrative is not enough to help us connect the dots and I suspect it is only by really getting totally into the album and trying to achieve consubstantiality with the creative vision of Roger Waters that you can really make sense of it all. This is why the production values of \\"The Wall\\" as performed by Pink Floyd in concert tended to replace the psychological dimensions of listening to it in the dark in your room.<br /><br />The key thing here is that there are moments in \\"The Wall\\" that match its ambition. The sum is greater than the total of the parts, but there is certainly nothing wrong with that being the case.teachers end up on that list.

B00006SFLV|5.0|I grew up on Angela Chase and her family...she was the same age as I was when this show was on.  For years, I had to watch episodes taped off the MTV reruns, so I was thrilled when this set came out on DVD.  I'm sad that it is out of print and costs so much these days.  I doubt anyone but a true diehard is going to be purchasing it at the price it is currently fetching.<br /><br />The series, surprisingly, isn't dated.  My younger sister has fallen in love with it while watching the DVDs I own.  The issues the characters deal with are very real and in no way presented in a afterschool special way.  Watching this now that I'm in my mid-twenties, I realize how much of the show is about the interactions between Angela's parents.  This show revealed parents as people, too, with their own host of issues in the world.  I think I gravitated more towards Angela and Rayanne when I was in high school, but now I see the bigger picture and relate to more of the characters.<br /><br />This series is a perfect 19 episodes.  I was sad when it was cancelled, but it will remain forever as this one excellent set of characters and storylines, and we never had to watch the show go downhill with age.
B0007LHBZE|5.0|\\"Carnival of Souls,\\" the only theatrical film every directed by Herk Harvey, is a cult classic with a most deserved reputation that puts it almost on a par with dead George Romero's \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" in terms of shoestring productions (In fact, the two films appear together on a recent DVD Double Feature).  There is a short list of black & white horror films made on the cheap that you should check out at some point (others would be \\"Dementia 13\\" and the original \\"Little Shop of Horrors,\\" although \\"A Bucket of Blood\\" is a better Roger Corman film).<br /><br />Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) accepts a car ride from a group of other young girls, only to end up in a drag race that sees the car go over a bridge with only Mary surviving. Having taken a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Mary heads for her new home, passing a deserted pavilion on the outskirts of town. Mary is drawn to the ruined bathing center/carnival, but has bigger problems since she keeps seeing a leering, corpse-like man (played by Harvey) watching her. Again and again Mary has the eerie experience of suddenly finding herself in a silent world where no one seems to notice her. Eventually she returns to the pavilions to come to the terrifying realization of what has happened.<br /><br />\\"Carnvial of Souls\\" came about because Harvey drove by Saltair, the deserted 1940s tourist resort outside Salt Lake City, and decided it would make a powerful location for a horror film. Harvey recruited John Clifford to come up with a screenplay that would involve Harvey's image of dead bodies rising from the lake to pursue their victim. The finished product certainly evokes a nightmarish quality that makes you ignore the technical problems with overdubbing, campy performances by the supporting cast, and such. Hilligloss, trained in the Method by Strassberg but denied any hint of her character's motivation by the director (think about it), only made one other film, \\"Curse of the Living Corpse\\" (1964), but this film is enough to secure her reputation in the field.<br /><br />Sidney Berger, the all too friendly guy down the hall at her boarding house, does a cameo as a cop in the 1998 \\"Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls\\" debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic. Given the high gloss shlock that is out there it is nice to see a horror film that is actually effective at creating a sense of unease without resorting to special effects.(1964), but this film is enough to secure her reputation in the field.  <br /> <br />Sidney Berger, the all too friendly guy down the hall at her boarding house, does a cameo as a cop in the 1998 \\"Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls\\" debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic.

068815333X|4.0|I got hooked on Lehane after Mystic River, and his thriller Shutter Island was absolutely gripping and completely mind-twisting. I had to stay up late one night to finish that, and I couldn't sleep afterwards, so I had to read a Dave Barry book to take my mind off it! I should have learned my lesson, because as soon as I got into Prayers for Rain, I couldn't get the creepiness and mystery out of my head, and I once again had to stay up late to finish the entire book.<br /><br />I'm a snob who usually avoids genre fiction, and I have a sneaking suspicion this might be found in the mystery/crime genre section, but Lehane is really a league above the other mytery writers I have read. Lehane is a masterful storyteller and has a rock solid plot here. He's very talented with the psychological aspects of crime (very much so in Shutter Island...I fear my review is becoming a big ad for that book!), and I wished he had further developed some of the psychological aspects in this book.<br /><br />The lesson I've learned about Lehane is that he is such a good and creepy storyteller than I'm no longer reading any of his books in bed late at night. They are only to be digested when I am lying on the beach.  If you enjoy thrillers, definitely get this book, and be prepared to be blown away by a well-crafted plot.
0786715103|5.0|The terrible truth about General Dellaire's book, \\"Shake Hands With The Devil\\" is that it is so well written it takes its place among the literary classics devoted to history such as Julius Caesar's Memoirs and Gibbon's Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire.  The General shows a profound awareness of literary tradition and wields it ruthelessly to expose the ruin at the heart of global humanity and how it lead to the  brutal rapes, mutilations and murders of almost a million human beings in the country of Rwanda. Corpses are piled everywhere and they fill the rivers and lakes of the country. The odor of death - perhaps the most diabolic odor in the world - is so strong and intense that the General feels it is impossible to physically move. The body of a boy trembles and the General trys to assist the lad but the body crumbles to pieces filled with worms and insects that had caused the flesh to quiver. <br />But there is something truly disquieting beneathe all of the evils and dark strategems described by the General. His book is essentially a work of atonement - but it goes furthur.  He contaminates us all with his atonement because almost all of us (myself especially) are guilty of the genocide. We did absolutely nothing while the political and economic alliances that seek to dominate our world handed the people of Rwanda over to unnatural horrors. <br />Those of us of rational age are guilty.  We must all follow in General Dellaires on-going work of expiation.
0060763280|5.0|I saw Eker speak before I read his book. It was at a seminar about using our lives for good and giving, rather than living in the scarcity mentality that leaves us in need of being taken care of ultimately by the government, our church, families or waiting for handouts. Harv's ideas of changing our mindset was part of the puzzle.  <br />     <br />   I thought, as I read Harv's book, of all those Bible passages I have read when God says to believe in blessings,and use our talents and its the love of money that is the root of all evil (Harv doesn't say to love money!!).  Harv reminds us to lose all the negative garbage..complaining, blaming, justifying and to be good managers of money (\\"...good stewards...\\")...anyone read the Bible parables!? <br />   <br />    Many of us were raised to believe money is 'sin', rich are evil so we stay broke and wait for handouts, telling our kids the same things to justify all we can't give them. Some can read the beautiful lessons of the Bible and still have files so full of fear, not of God, but money and knowing how to manage it.    <br /> <br />    I wanted to get new insight into the difference in thinking between the wealthy Christians who can help fund the church buildings, gift people with missions trips and buy buses for orphanages and the broke ones who want to give more but feel it is evil to think of making money to do so.   <br /> <br />   I read this book and I believe in God.  I also have old 'tapes' from family and scarcity minded teachers. I still believe in God and used Harv's words to remind me that God wants me to utilize all the brain and talents He has given me, be focused, productive, and with the ability to give even more than before.  Life isn't suppose to be about living in fear and worry, but giving thanks, asking God for guidance, being ready and able to give where needed, receive blessings, manage our thoughts and money and let go of the old 'earthly' messages that kept us trapped.  Seems like a pretty'Christian' mindset to me.

6305508550|5.0|What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?     I wasn't particularly interested in \\"Office Space\\" when it first came out, and I assume that it was a sleeper hit upon theatrical release, but when I checked it out much later, I was on the floor laughing. Not only does \\"Office Space\\" stand out as a great comedy for those starved of great comedy, but manages to hit closer with those actually victimized by white-collar occupations. It's suprising how this evolved from a series of cheaply-made animated shorts, starring the squirrely stapler-obsessed Milton, and into an underestimated masterpiece.    Some would say that a comedy doesn't really require top-notch acting to get its hilarity across, but \\"Office Space\\" is a grand exception. Ron Livingston is perfect in the role of Peter, who learns that by doing nothing you can find the ultimate happiness and confidence you seek (thanks to unreversed hypnosis). Gary Cole's portrayal of the boring yet frightening Lumbergh should be added to the pantheon of best screen villains ever, and Stephen Root was simply born to play Milton.    Mike Judge obviously felt compelled to split open the unexplored injustice of white-collar slavery and definitely makes it work. This isn't a gross-out comedy full of outrageous behavior (I don't know if the bludgeoning of the copy machine counts), but if you want to unwind after a tough day of school or work and enjoy a downright funny-as-hell movie, you're making the right decision to owe this one a few bucks.

B0007GAERG|2.0|I have been a Mariah Carey fan since she debuted in 1990, and as I look back at her body of work throughout the Nineties, I can't help but have a smile on my face.  It is said that music is the soundtrack to our lives and artists like Mariah prove that, because all you have to hear is one or two bars of a classic Mariah song and you are instantly transported to that time and place--that is the power of music and the power of a great singer.  Having said that, there is absolutely no way I am going to jump on the bandwagon and praise \\"The Emancipation of Mimi,\\" when in my heart I know it is only a shadow of the album it could--and should--have been.  The problem is not the heavy R & B slant of the songs, because most of them work great, which is especially evident on first two singles \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"We Belong Together.\\"  The problem is not the lyrics, because they are some of the most mature and personal of her career.  And the problem is not the production because, as expected, it shines.  What kills this album is the one thing that people don't seem to want to talk about . . . and that is Mariah's voice.  As I listened to one track after the next, I found precious few hints of the five-octave vocal powerhouse who blew the roof off the house with her first four or five albums.  Instead, what I found was a once-magnificent voice in serious decline.  On almost every song, Mariah's voice either cracks or squeaks, and she seems to have lost most of her ability to sing in her mid-range, because throughout the majority of the album she sings in a weak, whispery voice that is only occasionally broken up by more substantial vocals.  Her use of this voice is so prevalent that it becomes distracting.   Gone is that gorgeous, flexible, preternaturally gifted voice, capable of flowing from a thunderous high to a delicate flourish with remarkable grace and skill. You will not find vocals on her new album that will send chills up your spine or songs you will instantly wantto replay because you couldn't believe how damn good she sounded hitting a certain note.  I don't know if the culprit is cigarettes or stress--or something entirely different--but Mariah needs professional help with her voice, and she needs it now.  My guess is that she has some damage from nodules or broken blood vessels on her vocal cords and that she has not taken the proper time to heal and to re-learn her technique.  I could be wrong, but a voice like she HAD does not become a voice like she HAS for no apparent reason.  And it's not age--singers like Celine Dion, Patty LaBelle, and Barbra Streisand disprove that theory.  I love Mariah and I look forward to her future endeavors, but I am very concerned for her beautiful, rare instrument.  I can't be the only one who realizes that the voice on \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" is not emanating from a healthy woman.  I sincerely hope she gets the help she needs.    In response to the reviewer who had a problem with my comments, you will simply have to live with it.  If you bothered to read my entire review, you would notice that I am in no way bashing Mariah or criticizing her choice to do R & B.  I never once said that I long for her to return to her Nineties style of songs, nor did I suggest she should sing the same type of music over and over again.  What I said is that her voice is in terrible condition--and I stand by that comment 100%.  Nowhere in my review did I insult Mariah or her voice--if anything, I discussed my concern.  I don't know what others are hearing on her new album, but the voice I'm hearing is a ghost of what it used to be.  Period.  That is my honest and heartfelt opinion.  You don't need to agree with it . . . but, then, no one is asking you to.  Others are entitled to believe whatever they choose in regards to Mariah's voice , but I refuse to bestow praise when it is clearly not due.

B000002U82|5.0|The greatest album ever made. From \\"Speak to Me\\" to \\"Eclipse\\" you are drawn in and devastated by the sheer power and impact. This 1973 masterpiece will change lives for the rest of humanity. I would include \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and \\"The Wall,\\" in the top 10 all time albums soon followed my \\"Animals.\\" Um, these guys were kind of good.
B0008ISM40|3.0|I bought the NIN 'With Teeth' DualDisc this afternoon and played it in the car. I was so stupid that I didn't read the \\"Things You Should Know About DualDisc\\" card that came with the disc. I played the CD side of it in the CD-changer in my car and when the album was finsihed, I tried to eject the CD-changer magazine from the player. The disc was stuck in the magazine and wouldn't eject. So, I tried to wiggle the magaine a little bit and it finally ejected while my car was parked. I took the disc out of the magazine and it ended up with minor scratches on both sides of the disc. I applied the CD/DVD scratch remover and cleaned both sides of the disc and played it in my slim-body PlayStation 2 and both sides plays fine entirely. Playing DualDiscs in your car stereo, PC's or standard CD/DVD changers are NOT reccommended! The disc would get stuck in them and could cause serious damage to either the disc or the unit.  <br /> <br />Anyway, there's nothing special about DualDiscs. They just add the 5.1 surround sound channel of the entire recording on the DVD side like the DVD-Audios or SACD's along with the interactive discography, and a few music videos or live footage. IMHO, DualDiscs are worthless! I would rather stick with the standard CD version of any artist's albums.  <br /> <br />Now, about the recordings on the album. Trent Reznor was trying new tricks on this album. He was kinda trying to get 'With Teeth' to sound a little like 'Pretty Hate Machine' and 'The Downward spiral' blended together. However, this album is the most focused album NIN has ever done. Trent Reznor got a little help on drums by Dave Grohl of The Foo Fighters/Probot/Nirvana. The album was leaning a little more to New Wave with edgy guitars and keyboards, with some Electronic/Industrial texture. It's somewhat disappointing. However, I still like NIN and Trent Reznor's work. Trent Reznor is only a human and he's not a machine. He can't always come up with a \\"perfect\\" concept album. Machines aren't perfect either. I reccomend the NIN fans who are dissing this album to give it a few more listen. The more they listen to it, the more they'll like it rather than dissing it. I didn't like the album on my first listen, but I'll probably like it more if I give it a few more listen. <br /> <br />Morral of the story, DualDiscs are worthless piece of crap and are not worth your extra money. If you want the music videos that are available on the DualDiscs, just wait for the artist to release them on a long form standard DVD. Just stick with the standard CD for the same album.
B000001E18|5.0|Zooropa reminds me of the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour in that both albums are simultaneously each band's best album and also most underrated. <br /> <br />While Zoo has 3 weak songs, 7 songs are very good. I am astonished at the less than stellar reviews this ablum has on this website. Likewise, when talking to U2 fans I am amazed at how many dismised this album. <br /> <br />Like Magical Mystery Tour, there is a level of depth with respect to both the songwriting and the various background noises which gives this album incredible depth. Quite frankly, I think this album went over the head of the average person who was looking for another \\"Mysterious Ways\\". <br /> <br />It is a shame really as there is a lot to this album which allows one to listen to this album repeatedly sans getting sick of it. <br /> <br />
B00005T30L|5.0|I love this movie. The sarcasm, the music, the clothes etc...I purchased cds by Memphis Minnie and Skip James because of this movie, which are both enjoyable.In a wierd way I feel like I relate to Thora Birch's character;in fact, I'm sure we all can because everyone feels like an outsider at least once in their lives.
B00007KWHO|5.0|The best part about this albumn is Tony Kaye's Organ fest!  The orcastra takes it all out. But the bonus tracks (Also on Beyond And Before debute) have the raw recordings which are better than the studio stuff.  Bruford is manicaly fast and jazzy on drums and Tony Kaye is almost the dominate feature with the sixties style organ grinding which is awsome even to a youngster like me who doesn't hear much organ stuff in this more modern era.  Jon Anderson's voice is a little raw on some of the rehersal stuff but Chris Squire sings better than Jon on Dear Father.

B0007XT87G|5.0|Another great work by Porcupine Tree, continuing in the vein of In Absentia. Perhaps their heaviest CD, Deadwing should be satisfying for any metal fan with an ear for quality music. While not quite as progressive sounding as previous works, it still delivers with first rate musicianship.
0743454537|4.0|There aren't that many books that I recommend to people.  I mean, there are lots that I like, but none that say to me \\"So and so must read this!\\"  There are some that I *wish* people would like, such as the Mitford series, but I know those aren't for everyone.  I think this book is kind of like those. <br />The main character, Anna, was conceived because her sister, Kate, has leukemia and her older brother wasn't a good match to be a blood/tissue/organ donor.  Through some genetic stuff, Anna's parents made several embryos and chose to implant and carry to term the one that was a perfect genetic match for Kate.  That story was well-known since it was in the newspapers and was never hidden from Anna. <br />Can you imagine living your life knowing that your older sister, whom you love very much, is the only reason for your birth? That your body parts are fair game, if they help her?  The main thrust of the story is over Anna's wish NOT to be an organ donor and give up one of her kidneys to Kate. Anna hires an attorney and sues for medical emancipation.  The story is all about the events leading up to the trial. <br />Sara, the mother, gets on my last nerve. She is so focused on Kate, that she doesn't stop to think of Anna.  How can she expect her child to give up her kidney and go through that invasive medical procedure? She's only 13, for Pete's sake.  Sara accuses Anna of \\"thinking only of herself.\\" Well, of course she is.  A) no one else is going to do it and B) she's 13.  That's what 13 year olds do.  The entire family is in a turmoil because everything is all about Kate.  I can't imagine what it's like to have a child dying.  I also can't imagine not consulting the child whose body is being used to save her sister.   <br />It's a difficult book to read.  I won't tell you the ending because it would ruin things.  I was disappointed in the ending, on one hand.  On the other, it made me cry.   <br />
B0007OCG56|1.0|Oh, what a massive disappointment James L. Brooks has created.  Not being too excited about his work after seeing the devastatingly poor film As Good As It Gets, I thought that he may be able to redeem himself with some Sandler magic, while showcasing the point (like P.T. Anderson did) that Sandler has this very rich emotional side to him as well as the hysterical moments.  Sadly, this never did happen.  With an extremely choppy story, some overzealous acting by everyone involved, and one of the poorest production values this side of the Hollywood Mississippi, Spanglish proves that you can have a powerful cast, an interesting idea, and an Oscar winning director, but unless you compile them correctly, all you have is a jumbled mess of garbage.<br /><br />My largest issue with this film has to be the unconnected story.  There were so many creative ideas in this film, that from the outside it looked like it could have been an Oscar contender, but as you view it from the inside, it is nothing but unfinished roads and dead ends.  Brooks knows how to tell a story, in fact, he has won an Oscar for telling his stories, but in Spanglish, he took in more than he could handle.  There were so many different elements in this film, from Leoni's secret, to Sandler's cooking, to Vega's mothering skills, to a child's dream, that Brooks could not keep up with them all and successfully bring conclusions to each of them.  Spanglish jumped from one moment to the next without giving the viewer an opportunity to say, \\"Well, at least that was resolved\\".  It was so choppy that I hoped that Brooks would have provided seatbelts to anyone watching.  With all these themes and elements converging into a very unclimactic ending, you leave this story with a sense of \\"wha...\\" You have no real grasp on this story, the characters, or the ending as the final credits begin to roll.  Who was the true protagonist to the story?  Who was the central focus?  What were the major themes that I should have been watching?  There were so many negative \\"who\\" and \\"what\\" questions at the end of this movie that I immediately threw the case to the corner of the room as if it were possessed.  Brooks crafted a pitiful story that he could not control, and the final product was this hastily made story, which began in the middle of nowhere and thankfully ended there as well.<br /><br />With the story giving us nothing but questions instead of answers, it is then left up to the actors to carry the weight of the entertainment on their shoulders.  Again, with Sandler, Leoni, and Vega, you think that you would have an amazing dynamic set in place that a story could be poor without anyone noticing.  Well, let me tell you ... it was noticeable.  Sandler was not the lead that Brooks needed for this film.  While it is obvious that he can play an \\"every man\\" quite well, it is the emotional pressures that he has trouble with.  The scene in which he is asked to cry is ... well ... hysterically pathetic.  There is just no excitement around his character, and at one time I referred to his character in this film as \\"bland\\".  I think it is because Tea Leoni, who puts too much emotion into her character, poorly balances him out.  Here you have Sandler doing a low-key performance, and Leoni is well over the top.  There was no development in either of their characters, just screaming and crying.  This does not help progress the story well either.  Vega added nothing more than a \\"cute\\" element that honestly wasn't needed at all.  The only character that I thought did an exceptional job was Cloris Leachman who took these horrible performances and created her moment to shine.  She stole the film from everyone else, and I was proud of her.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that if your films have won Oscars in the past, and you are living well off The Simpsons money, than you have the budget to film actors actually driving a car to their destination instead of just using a green screen and fake driving.  Maybe it was just me, but I felt as if the production value of this film was not Hollywood standards.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind a low-budget film at all, but I felt that Brooks was being super-cheap in Spanglish.  This hurt this film tremendously.  Maybe it was the DVD transfer, but it felt as if Brooks was cutting numbers in the film and it began with the production value.  It started out strong, but somehow felt less and less like itself by the end.  This did not make for good cinematic viewing.<br /><br />Overall, I was very unimpressed with this picture.  Brooks had a decent idea that somewhere along the creation of it went horribly wrong.  One could say that he had too many ideas and could not carry the weight of them all successfully on his camera.  There were ideas piled upon ideas that literally went nowhere, nor didn't really have any conclusion.  The elements were there, Brooks couldn't do anything with them.  Coupled with the fact that there was not any decent acting in the entire film.  This emotional step was too big for Sandler (and too fast), while Leoni was too over-the-top.  Vega felt like a stand in, while I just couldn't grasp the kiddy elements.  Finally, what hurt this film the most, I believe was the poor production value (especially in the car scenes) that brought this film into the realm of bad news bears.  While I think I am in the minority, I believe that this was not the greatest outing for Brooks, nor anyone else involved.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****ke driving.

B000000WZ4|5.0|Gore and the boys have really stepped it up a notch with this release.  A focused effort, beautifully engineered and infinitely listenable.  You'll want to store this one in the car, it's a great soundtrack to any subversive road \\"trips\\" you'll want to take.
0783225903|2.0|This movie is loved by just about every art director I know. They loved it because it looks great. No argument there. No surprises either as Gilliam is art-based. But the price you pay for a visual feast is that the story is an indulgent, non-involving fantasy which just goes on forever. If you're into a fairy tale that uses more and more detail in an attempt to make itself real, and constantly rewards the eyes then it will all come together magically for you. Seems like a lot of reviewers feel like this. But for me, the trade-off between how the film looks versus pretty much everything else about it ends up in the negative. None of the performances stood out. It did not hold my interest. I could not watch this movie to the end after two attempts. Enough, already.

Settlers from England land on the shores of Virgina to find gold, but when captain John Smith is exploring around the place he falls in love with Pocahontas and she falls in love with him but soon war has begun between the two races as only love must conquer the war and hatred.<br /><br />A visually stunning and breathtaking yet serious disney animated feature which is after the success of \\"The Lion King\\", many have accused this movie of being historically inaccurate but relax folks it's only a movie, not all movies ( animated or live action) have to follow exactly to history or a legend. This features of the voices of Mel Gibson, Beauty and The Beast's David Ogen Stiers, Irene Bedard, Russell Means, Christian Bale, Linda Hunt and Billy Connelly and stunning artwork with a great soundtrack by Aladdin's, Beauty and The Beast's and Little Mermaid's Alan Menken including the memorable \\"Colors of the Wind\\" song.<br /><br />The new 2-Disc DVD is a slight improvement over the previous DVD but with better picture & excellent sound quality thanks to THX, it contains two versions such as the new 10th Anniversary special edition with a new animated musical segment that was cut out called \\" If i never knew you\\" and the original theatrical cut, with extras like games, audio commentary, art galleries, featurettes, multi-language reel, behind the scenes, Publicity and more.<br /><br />The movie may not be as good as \\"Mulan\\" though for a Disney movie based on a legend, but it's still a must have for every animation collector's DVD library, this movie is guaranteed to make the viewer cry and laugh then have fun.
B00000F1D3|5.0|In January of 1998, Cher had received the most devastating news she'll ever receive in her lifetime: The Death Of Sonny Bono. Cher was asked to give Sonny's Eulogy at his funeral. Through her grieving tears, Cher had gotten through it. <br /> <br />    On November 10, 1998, Cher had released her next album entitled, BELIEVE. This was the album that brought our Dark Lady back into the game. Throughout the 60s, 70s, & 80s, Cher had been a true Diva, but with this album, Cher's Divahood was etched in stone and there is no way to renounce that. This album is truly amazing, without a doubt. It displays Cher's use of Pop & 90s Retro Disco sound & Club Techno sound. Every fan on this planet, or even in this galaxy should have this album. <br /> <br />BELIEVE <br />  The first single from the album. And the album's title track. When I heard this song for the first time, I thought to myself, \\"Who is singing this song? This song is f***ing awesome\\". I knew the voice sounded so familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it. When the radio DJ said that it was Cher, I nearly had a heartattack. This song is just absolutely incredible. As it would turn out, this song is Cher's fourth #1 hit single. <br /> <br />THE POWER <br />  This song is very cool, but it is a little weak. <br /> <br />RUNAWAY <br />  Why is it every song that I seem to favor never released as a single? This is one of my favorite songs from this album. I cannot help but listen to this song right after hearing the album's title track. <br /> <br />ALL OR NOTHING <br />  The fourth & final single from the album. I had never really listened to this song, until earlier in April of this year. I know I'm late. It was one of those songs that I seemed to have skipped over. But when I actually took the time to listen to the whole song, I was completely mesmorized by how incredible it was. <br /> <br />STRONG ENOUGH <br />  The second single from the album. This song is the best example of Cher's use of 1990s Retro Disco sound. I love this song and you all should too. The video for this song is just spectacular, but the blonde hair is not for Cher. For me, Cher's hair color looks best in Black, Rusty Red, or Blood Red. <br /> <br />Dov L'AMORE <br />  The third single from the album. I love Spanish influenced ballads, just like this one. Cher is not the only artist to record a Spanish influenced ballad. Madonna, I think, was the first with \\"La Isla Bonita\\" & \\"Spanish Eyes\\". Mariah Carey followed in 1997 with \\"My All\\". Toni Braxton would have hers in 2000 with \\"Spanish Guitar\\". This song is just outstanding. <br /> <br />TAKIN' BACK MY HEART <br />  Pretty much the weakest song on the album. <br /> <br />TAXI TAXI <br />  The beat is pretty repitious, but it is real catchy and I love it. It is another one of Cher's, \\"Get up off your a** and start dancing\\" songs. <br /> <br />LOVE IS THE GROOVE <br />  Another song that should have been released as a single. Damn it! Love this song. <br /> <br />WE ALL SLEEP ALONE (Remix) <br />  Original version from the album CHER (1987). I am not sure as to why the remix of this song was included her. I guess Cher wanted another Disco sounding song to close out the album and I guess that remixing \\"We All Sleep Alone\\" was the only song she could think of. Great remix. <br /> <br />    If you are a Cher fan and you do not have this album in your collection, then, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?!?! Time is running out. Get this album now, before it's too late.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Maybe it's 'cos I'm from the UK - the theatre I saw this film in was full of Canadian students having a jolly good time - but Napolean Dynamite did nothing for me.  Laughed once, maybe.  Seemed like the kind of thing you would think was good if you were in high school and some of your friends had made it.  Just very, very dull. <br /> <br />But probably appeals to North Americans. <br /> <br />I saw it in a double bill with Shawn Of The Dead.  Now there's a proper film.
1881273156|5.0|This book is filled with \\"A-ha\\" moments from cover to cover. My eyes were opened to so many simple things, things that made huge improvements in my relationships with my husband, my children, my friends, my parents, sisters, in-laws, and even strangers. This is a simple book to read and to understand. Your relationship doesn't have to be broken to benefit from Chapman's advice-- applying the love languages will strengthen all bonds. I highly, highly recommend this book.(This book makes a great wedding gift.)
B00005QZ7U|5.0|You will either love or hate this movie.  (just read the reviews) Personally, I think it's absolutely stunning.  The music, the costumes and sets...even the camera angles.  The story is relativly simple -It doesn't need to be complex...it's about true love- but nothing else about the movie is.  The acting and singing are perfect (who knew Nicole Kidman could sing?) and it's funny!  The first time I saw this it made me want to laugh, cry and cheer hysterically all at once.  Everything in this movie is about seeing things from a new angle, thinking outside of the box.  The music is all recycled, it's true, but it's presented in a brand new way, trust me, you've never heard \\"diamonds are a girls best friend\\" like this before.  Move over Marilyn.  There are midgets, absinthe, singing, dancing, and true love, all in one movie how can it not be great?  And amidst all the chaos; the sound,the whirling, the color, and the sensory overload is the true message.  Simple and sweet.  The greatest thing you'll ever know is love. Wow!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Slipknot's music is garbage. If ever the term \\"noise\\" could be brought up in regard to a band's sound, that's what Slipknot would be. No, I don't mean \\"noise\\" in regard to metal. For example, if I coordinate stomping on the floor with slapping somebody in the face repeatedly, does that make me a musical genius? <br /> <br />Hell no. <br /> <br />Slipknot is a gimmick band in EVERY sense of the word. \\"What has their fans so hooked?\\" you might ask. I'll tell you -- the MASKS. Whenever anybody brings these guys up in a conversation, it's never about how \\"good\\" their music is. It's about their corny halloween masks. What people seem to like is Slipknot's look (and above all else, being degraded and labeled \\"maggots.\\") That term alone is a joke on all of you numb-skulls. Believe me, the band has a great laugh at you guys running around proclaiming yourself a maggot with such pride. How great it is to be a maggot! YEEEAH! <br /> <br />No. <br /> <br />Now aside from Slipknot's latest endeavor in being pure trash on a musical level, let's also not forget who they owe their fame to. A little band called MUSHROOMHEAD. Mushroomhead are true artists -- the gimmick isn't their selling point, their music is. The way it should always be. It was once stated by somebody that each and every song Mushroomhead produces is like a grand painting that can be displayed on a wall and appreciated for what it is; A masterpiece. They have depth and a great sound, so please repent of your Slipknot ways and accept Mushroomhead. You'll be doing yourself and the world a favor.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie gave me goosebumps, and made me cry...true the singing isn't quite as strong as you might hope, but what are the chances of finding another Sarah Brightman, or Michael Crawford?  And it's not like the singers are bad!  Not even close...they just aren't the original cast, and you can hardly blame them for that! I've been a Phantom affictionato (yeah, well, you try to spell it) for years and have seen some really dreadfull interpretations.  This isn't one of them.  The casting is wonderful, Christine and the phantom both look perfect, and Minnie Driver manages to steal every scene she's in...even though all her singing is dubbed!  The costumes and sets are lavish and the music is all faithfully reproduced, along with almost all the dialogue. As an added bonus, just about everything in the movie that's not in the broadway musical was taken directly from the book! That never happens! There are a few sticky points (like the timing of the chandalier) but for the most part it's as close to perfection as you can get.

0802130208|5.0|Looking over review after review of this book, I found two camps... and I wasn't the least bit surprised by their distances. First there are those that praise the book for being a literary milestone, an achievement of grand scope and memorable characters. The second group sees the book as wasted paper, a book with no redeeming qualities or characters, and no solid or memorable message.<br /><br />I'm in the former category, but for an entirely different reason. First let me say that this book (which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1981) is NOT for everyone. If you enjoy upbeat, easily readable material with a smattering of bathroom humor, you'll need to look elsewhere. But if you like comedy that goes deep into character follies and Shakespearean-style astuteness, you'll probably love it.<br /><br />The main character is one of the most memorable I've ever read, which is probably why it got the Pulitzer. Ignatius Reilly is an overweight, over-educated, underachieving loser who, late into his adulthood, still lives with his alcoholic mother in the colorful city of New Orleans. Every life that Ignatius touches - or even gets near - spirals out of control. He lies, he won't work (until forced to by his mother after she crashes her car and the threat of foreclosure on their home becomes evident), and has no real friends. A loner, a loser, a person bound for obscurity.<br /><br />But little does Ignatius know that his depressing life will lead all those around him into a brighter place (even maybe himself). Even though Ignatius' \\"world view\\" and his \\"stomach valve\\" try to thwart any attempt at joining a \\"normal\\" facet of society, his errors and misdeeds will eventually lead \\"Fortuna\\" into a positive cycle. This is the message that John Kennedy Toole (the author) was trying to get across to us (for those who missed it). This is also my reason for enjoying the book so very much. The message is imbedded in the story so deeply, so inanely, that you have to take the story as a whole to enjoy it, not just its pieces. That and the fact that Mr. Toole gave us one of the most irritatingly worthless characters, added to the enjoyment of the overall narrative. Even now, I can't get Ignatius out of my head! I absolutely despise him! But then, I was supposed to. The author did a perfect job.<br /><br />And speaking of the author, it is noteworthy to mention that John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969, apparently ending his life of severe depression. Years after his death, his mother (Thelma) discovered the manuscript for \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" and thrust it under the nose of an unwitting agent who soon found out he had a literary gem on his hands. A shame Mr. Toole never lived to see such praise heaped upon his work.s a whole to enjoy it, not just its pieces.

B000002LBH|5.0|These are the best of the best.  Albums aside, the Smiths most rare and raucous tracks find their way onto Louder than Bombs.  Living up to the title, the Smiths bash their way through the breakneck Sweet and Tender Hooligans, and brooding Rubber Ring.  Bashful and dismal Morrissey's bellowing lyrics and Marr's growling guitars are beautifully featured on this compelling compilation. <br /> <br />The Smiths were, after all, a rock band, with pop sensibility perhaps but ultimately their charm and success worked its way from the punk influenced drums and monotone vocals.   <br /> <br />Moving on to bigger and sometimes better things, this is a totem from the good old days.  When lads were lads and the Smiths were the biggest thing.
B0009MAO46|5.0|Finally, I did not get a chance to purchase the amazing 3Disc Ultimate Toy Box so I have been without these cool extras forever. But now with this Two-Disk Edition I can now get all of these amazing special features for a low,low price. So far, I cant tell you much about the DVD, but I will get to that later. <br /> <br />First, the movie. Toy Story premiered in 1995, and when I went to see it in theatres I was utterly amazed. I hadnt seen any fully CG movie until then. The story was unique, the charcters were lovable, and the movie is unforgetable. Evryone knows that Toy Story has paved the way for all of our CG movies, now-a-days. If TS would have bombed at the box office, maybe there would be no Finding Nemo, no Shrek, and no Monsters Inc.! This was the first movie that was put out by Disney and Pixar which is now a very profitable arrangement.  <br /> <br />The DVD is also expected to be freakin' awesome!

B000002HH2|5.0|Ten years after its release, Bj&ouml;rk's _Post_ does not sound dated in any way, something that will likely be said of all of Bj&ouml;rk's albums (except perhaps _Debut_) as the years pass.  On _Post_, Bj&ouml;rk fuses the avant-garde approach to music she cultivated in the Sugarcubes with her nascent wonderment for electronic sounds; what comes out of this marriage is a CD that is nothing short of remarkable.<br /><br />Listening to _Post_ now, it is easy to see the signposts that point back to Bj&ouml;rk's old music, and forward to the music that was to come from her.  \\"The Modern Things\\" harkens back to the inspired silliness of the Sugarcubes, and \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" makes evident Bj&ouml;rk's appreciation for the classics.  The grinding sounds of \\"Army of Me\\" and \\"Enjoy\\" reflect Bj&ouml;rk's own interests in industrial music around 1995 due to her relationships with Tricky and Goldie.<br /><br />The songs that are prescient of Bj&ouml;rk's future turns in her career, though, are the true highlights of _Post_.  The epic climaxes of \\"Hyper-ballad\\" and the rushing strings of \\"Isobel\\" prefigure the lush soundscapes and naked, raw emotions of _Homogenic_, while the minimalism of \\"You've Been Flirting Again,\\" \\"Cover Me\\" and \\"Headphones\\" foreshadow the compositions of _Vespertine_ and _Medulla_.<br /><br />_Post_ serves as testament that Bj&ouml;rk certainly did not suffer from a \\"sophomore jinx\\" on her second major-label album; if anything, on _Post_ Bj&ouml;rk manages to escape what few elements of \\"mainstream music\\" happened their way onto _Debut_, and stakes her claim as one of the most independent and unique singers and songwriters of turn-of-the-millennium culture.  All those who can get past portrayals of Bj&ouml;rk in the insipid mass-media as \\"the weird chick in the swan dress\\" should purchase _Post_ and discover for themselves the early roots of Iceland's foremost musical genius.
B00000720W|5.0|Deathcrush is frozen into the godly status of black metal. Most people think of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas when they think of Mayhem (not that it is a bad album), but Deathcrush is what started it all. Its a pretty simple album, but simplicity proves to be a virtue here. The opening riff for the title track is simple but it kicks some MAJOR a$$! This album was very contreversal in its time, and still holds up to the title of music made by black metal gods. Read the lyrics too, especally for Chainsaw Gutsf**k. Awesome blazing black metal by the legendary Mayhem.       <br /> <br /> <br />R.I.P. Euronymous

B0002Z9HT8|1.0|I have recorded entire live aide broad cast on MTV back in 1985, and is better than this official release for quality, and sound, as well as MISSING so many valuable performance. WHY????? is my question. Yeah, it is about Hungry for Africa, but to raise money, you want to provide what its worth. DO NOT BUY it if you want to go back in time for your personal memory....give DONATION direct to UNICEF instead. Also, PLEASE make sure where your money is going to first.
B0000039QA|5.0|Ready To Die is one of my favourite rap albums ever and i am considering buying it again as my original has been played far too much by me and friends, but it was time for a change so i got Life After Death,while this album may have some crap, the positives kill the negatives. It is very hard for an artist to make a double album and have everything great (Greatest Hits don't count)i mean there are songs on here i would consider filler, but having both this and 2pac All Eyez On Me double album as well and i am a Pac fan i would say this is better than the 2pac double album, that album especially the 2nd disc had way too much filler. Now my favourites are Somebody's Gotta Die, Hypnotize, Kick in the Door, Last Day, I Love the Dough, What's Beef?, Niggas Bleed, I Got a Story to Tell, Notorious Thugs, Going Back to Cali, Ten Crack Commandments, Long Kiss Goodnight, My Downfall, You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You) and Sky's the Limit now all these tracks provide banging beats, Big just flowing and wordplaying or telling and griping you with storytelling. The other tracks i aint really feeling either the beat is rubbish or the guests i hate like R.Kelly on F*ck You Tonight or Lil'Kim on Another. 15/24 aint bad for the album tracks i like, get this album now but dont expect Ready To Die material.
B000929AJQ|4.0|It's now officially been 1 week since \\"With Teeth\\" was released and I picked up my copy.  I've waited to review this one so I could allow it some time to sink in and get a more accurate perception of it.  After waiting nearly 6 years for another NIN album, I am satisfied with the results.  However, I think in the long-run when Trent Reznor is officially done with Nine Inch Nails, I don't think this will be one of the stand-out albums.  Since I'm a die-hard NIN fan, it would be easy for me to say...\\"everything Trent touches is gold, I give it 5 stars...\\".  Instead, I'm going to review this CD not as a NIN fan, but according to my general taste in music.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"All The Love In The World,\\" which is a very quiet, yet bass-driven song.  In fact, the majority of the song, you hear piano, bass, and Trent's whispering.  Considering how quiet and suttle the song is, you'll find it stuck in your head after a couple listens.  Very good song, but there are better things to come.<br /><br />Next is \\"You Know What You Are,\\" and it's probably one of only two songs on this CD that I would call heavy.  It has a fast drum-beat with a very aggressive chorus involving loud guitar and creepy piano.  It's probably as close as the album gets to sounding like \\"Downward Spiral\\".<br /><br />The third song is called \\"The Collector.\\"  This one didn't stand out for me at first, but the more I listen to it, the more I like it. (As is the case with the whole album.)<br /><br />The fourth song is the album's first single, \\"The Hand That Feeds.\\" If you're reading this review, you've probably heard it by now.  I absolutely love this song...I think it's one of the catchiest songs Trent has ever written, even if it is a bit pop-sounding.  As good as this song is, it's not a good representation of the rest of the album's sound.  Nothing else on \\"With Teeth\\" sounds similar to it, or has that sort of song structure.  Depending on your out-look, this could be good or bad, but it doesn't bother me either way.<br /><br />Next is \\"Love Is Not Enough\\"...another song I didn't think much of at first, but grew on me. It's kinda slow, yet angry.<br /><br />\\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\" is another song that ended up growing on me quite a bit.  At first I thought the chorus was too repetitive, but now it's stuck in my head.  The song sounds a lot like something from the \\"Fragile\\" album, so much in fact, I wouldn't doubt it was written at that time. The guitar solo even sounds similar to the solo on \\"The Fragile\\" (the song).<br /><br />Track 7 is the title track, \\"With Teeth.\\" Although it's kinda weird, I like it a lot. Again, the guitar sounds similar to \\"Fragile\\"-era stuff.<br /><br />\\"Only\\" is penned to be the album's next single. This one has grown on me a lot.  The mood is similar to that of \\"Into The Void\\"...angsty yet upbeat.  There's a combination of piano and very techno sounding keyboards, while Trent does some singing similar to that of \\"Down In It\\".<br /><br />\\"Getting Smaller\\" is the other song on the album that I would call heavy. It's kinda hard to describe, try the sound sample to get an idea.<br /><br />Track 10 is \\"Sunspots\\" and is one of my favorites on the album. It's just very experimental with some very cool sounds. Again, kinda hard to describe.<br /><br />\\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" starts off sounding very rough.  The drums are static sounding, and the vocals sounding like they were recorded on a cassette player in someone's garage. The bass is very in-your-face, and you can clearly tell that it's Jeordie White. If anyone ever saw Marilyn Manson in concert, you could always recognize Jeordie's (Twiggy's) signature sound, which is a very rattling, low bass sound. It's recognizable on a few other songs. Anyway, the chorus sounds a little less raw, and gets stuck in your head easily.<br /><br />\\"Beside You In Time\\" was the song you may have heard in the \\"With Teeth\\" teaser trailer.  Even though this track doesn't go in many directions, I really like it. It just starts off simple and gradually builds to a big climax. I think it would have been better to open the CD with this song.<br /><br />The final song, \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" is one of Trent's absolute best writings. It's very sad, and measures up to past tunes such as \\"Hurt\\" or \\"The Great Below\\".  There's some electronic noises going on, but it's mostly a sad piano melody with Trent's muffled singing, which clears up later in the song.  The lyrics are excellent!<br /><br />All in all, I am very pleased with how \\"With Teeth\\" turned out. Again, I don't think it'll be one of Trent's most defining musical moments, but if you've enjoying everything he's done so far, then this is for you. If you're just looking to hear the heavy anthems like \\"Wish\\" or \\"Star****ers\\" then you'll probably be let down.  For me, it'll probably still be one of the best (if not the best) album of 2005.  If I had to compare this album to one of his past efforts, I'd say \\"The Fragile\\", even though it's very different. There is a lot less stringed instruments this time, and the guitar plays a much smaller role. It's much more about the bass and drums. Anyway, big NIN fans will like this, metal-heads probably won't. Either way, I can't urge you enough to keep listening to this CD. On my first 2 listens, I was like, \\"....eh.\\" But now I'm addicted to it and listen to it every day. It grows on you a lot, so just keep listening!!! To me, it's a brilliant piece and I'm glad to finally have it in my hands.ack doesn't go in many directions, I really like it.

B000929AJQ|5.0|Nine Inch Nails is known as a legendary band, and Trent Reznor is worshipped and revered like a god. So everything he does is going to come under the microscope, big time.<br /><br />This record does not hold up under the microscope. And this is a GOOD thing - this is a record of three-minute pop songs. And that is also a good thing. Why, you ask? Because while The Fragile was a fantastic album, The Fragile part 2 would have been less so, and part 3 even less, until it all ended up just downright bad. Same thing with The Downward Spiral as well. That was all nice and good at the time, but this is a new record, and these are new songs.<br /><br />Trent knows all this. Thus, With Teeth was born - an album of angsty three-minute pop songs with catchy melodies and 80's new wave undercurrents. Is this my favorite Nine Inch Nails album? Probably not. Nothing will ever beat The Fragile for me. This is a much less \\"deep\\" record. But this is a greatly satisfying, catchy, FUN album. That's right! FUN!! Oh my god, Trent Reznor isn't actually as miserable as you had all hoped. What a shame...<br /><br />There are no songs I feel are especially weak, that should have been ommitted from the record. However, because of the humongous expectations placed on the record, it is bound to seem a bit underwhelming. It has terrific standouts, though, that will be making my best-of compilations for years to come - \\"All the Love in the World\\" is a classic album opener, although maybe too mellow for some people's tastes. \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" is not my favorite song on the album but it has a great melody and was the perfect choice for a single. \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" has a chorus that recalls the anthemic emotion of \\"We're In This Together,\\" all though it is notably more light-hearted. \\"Getting Smaller\\" is a quick-paced rocker that borrows heavily from The Pixies' album \\"Trompe le Monde.\\" \\"Beside You In Time\\" brings to mind the nu-wop of TV On the Radio and \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" is perfect as an album closer (providing the album with its main moment of introspective meloncholy that people seem to miss so much on the rest of the album.) Of course it doesn't live up to \\"Hurt\\" on the emotional scale, but how many closers really do?<br /><br />Overall, this is the Nine Inch Nails record to listen to when you're NOT slitting your wrists. sorry, goth kids... Trent is MINE now.loser (providing the album with its main moment of introspective meloncholy that people seem to miss so much on the rest of the album.)

B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Bubl is outstanding. I would especially recommend on this album: Come Fly with Me, Summerwind, Kissing a Fool, Put Your Head on My Shoulder. His voice makes me melt. I am getting married this fall & he has been the inspiration for the event's music. A wonderful addition to any CD collection.
B000093BDX|5.0|The Beach Boys are like a definition of beach rock. The cool surfing styles and the pretty girls on the beach. The have it made. I love the songs on this CD. Even though they are a little more crowd pleasing instead of thoughtfulness. They still are pure greatness.
B00014K5TQ|2.0|Seth Green is the only actor in the movie.  Everyone else is trying to act.  <br /> <br />I give two stars because the costumes were fantastic and so was the make up.   <br /> <br />I wanted to give no stars because too many things were trying to get covered in too little time.   <br /> <br />Did anyone really understand Gitzies importance?  Or why the club kids went on tour?  I did, but only because I knew the story before I saw the movie...maybe that's why I'm so upset with this production.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Unfortunately the current Spin article on Trent is better than his latest album White Teeth.  I found this \\"industrial\\" album to be more along the Techno lines, which is cool for some people but not true NIN fans.  I bought the album because \\"fragile\\" left me wanting more from NIN, but I was not happy With Teeth.  Trent has overcome alot to get this album out and at the under 10 buck price I would suggest it to anyone curious.  However, if one wants to truly see the genius of NIN go out and buy pretty hate machine or Downward Spiral.
B00005MP58|1.0|The BBC production of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is one of my favorites. <br /> <br />I am sadly disappointed in the re-mastered wide-screen Special Edition version (released 2001) of this wonderful production.  Everything is greenish, as if it had been shot through a green filter.  The images look like a second or third generation video tape copy.  I cannot recommend it.   <br /> <br />In comparison, I was very pleased with the quality of both the VHS version (released 1998) of this production, and the 200th Anniversary version on DVD in a full-screen format (released 1998). <br /> <br />The content of the BBC production is wonderful -- acting, story, characters, costumes, scenery, music, etc. -- and I wish the quality of the wide-screen DVD version was as good as the content. <br /> <br />
0316172324|5.0|In the past, pageturners have been those books (usually mystery or spy novels) that you simply couldn't put down because they sucked you in for a few hours of enjoyment.  With his second book, Gladwell has crafted a book every bit as addicting as \\"The Tipping Point.\\"  Having used \\"The Tipping Point\\" as a book for students in high school business programs, I wish I taught psychology, as \\"Blink\\" would give me plenty to chew on.  Students would thrill to the part about observing the couples for a few minutes to figure out if they will stay together!  More importantly, the account of the failed war games can make one pause at the way our military is preparing for war around the world.  Just like his previous book, Gladwell gives us plenty to chew on here, which means its effects will linger long after you've read it in a four hour session.  Can't wait to see what Gladwell tackles next!
B000089CG8|5.0|What a fantastic DIGITAL recording of Prokofiev's masterpiece!  This is probably my favorite ballet, and so I have collected (too) many recordings trying to find the perfect one.  Previn's London Symphony and Maazel's Cleveland Orchestra recordings are both admirable, but Ashkenazy's account with the Royal Philharmonic rises to the top of my list.    Ashkenazy succeeds in bringing out Prokofiev's jaunty rhythms and captures the deep passion and romance that these young \\"star-crossed\\" lovers experienced for one another.  The tempos seem appropriate throughout.  Ashkenazy's tempo changes in the \\"Love Dance\\" caught me a bit off guard at first, but after listening a few times they made sense (I can't remember what the score calls for there).  This account, more than any other that I've heard, summons the image of dancers on stage.  (For a more symphonic approach, look to Previn's recording.)    The Royal Philharmonic is simply superb.  My biggest complaint with most other recordings of this ballet (including Previn's) is that the violins are so often out-of-tune.  The intonation here, however, is simply impeccable.  The strings play warmly and with precision (see, especially, \\"Romeo Decides to Avenge Mercutio\\"), and the first violins are simply amazing in the \\"Balcony Scene.\\"  The woodwind solos are beautifully played throughout (the flute solos are much clearer and better supported than those in Maazel's recording, and the oboe solos are darker and warmer than those in both Maazel's and Previn's orchestras).  The brass section is fantastic in all three recordings, but balance notably well here.    The digital recording gives Ashkenazy an advantage over Maazel and Previn.  The sound is crystal clear, which allows one to appreciate Prokofiev's unique orchestration techniques, such as his use of soaring violin harmonics and haunting low-register piccolo.  The transparency of sound also allows one to hear details such as interesting woodwind doubling and middle horn partsmuch more clearly.    Overall, I would recommend this recording above all others.  There are very few moments that aren't flawless, the orchestra is virtuosic, the sound is fantastic, and the full spectrum of emotions that this story evokes is exploited to the fullest.  Of course owning other recordings, especially Maazel's and Previn's, is essential for the truly committed fan of this work, but if you plan to have only one recording, this should be your one.
6300182282|1.0|The fine acting aside, I really hate the subject matter of this film.  It primarily involves itself with the superficial adulteress yearly affair of a rather selfish man and woman.  What it fails to adequately address is the moral and physiological implications of \\"cheating\\" and how it not only affects the spouses of the people having the affair, but the cheaters themselves.  As you begin to justify something as potentially devastating as infidelity, what other moral values might you be able to \\"overlook\\" in order to get something that make you \\"feel\\" good?<br /><br />Although this movie has its moments, I just can't get past the glorification it gives to adultery, to enjoy it.
B0000A02U2|1.0|I must have seen this movie 20 times as a kid.   <br />Could not wait to watch the DVD:   <br />- HEY!

0393317552|3.0|Diamond explicitly sets out to prove that the differing patterns of settlment which occured on this planet were in no way related to the people in the various regions, that it was exclusivly based on local conditions.  This thesis can't always hold true, although it certainly generally does. <br />His synthesis of avialable data on the cultivation of plants and animals is nice, and accurate.  It explains why some places domesticated critters and plants while others didn't, by looking at locally avialable candidates and evaluating thier suitability for domestication as a whole; do the avialable, readily domesticatable plants and animals come close to providing a decent diet?  This is the strongest point of his book, at least in my opinion, and makes the book worth reading.  Most of this scholarship has been done before (look at the bibliography for this section), but this is a strong synthesis for those of us without extensive ag experince.   <br /> <br />He also, however, brings in the lattitude angle, which is fundamentally flawed.  His position is that contienents with a east-west axis are better suited for the spread of plants and animals, due to the similar lattitude and thus more similar climates.  However, this ignores drastic climaticit variation in the form of elevation and precipiation changes; Lyons France, and Odessa Ukraine, have similar lattitudes and different climates.  It is a weak thesis, and he does not truly deal with any of the counterarguments readily avialable, which is truly dissapointing.He may have had some rebuttals to the counterarguments hidden away, but we don't get to see them. Given that this thesis is easily attackable, it's a shame.  <br /> <br />When it comes to the epidomological section of his book, I am simply too ill-informed to comment much; he maintains that the proximity of early Europeans to animals  helped expose them to disease,particularly more virulent ones, making them more immune.   <br /> <br />I feel this was weaklydeveloped myself; he maintains that European and Asian exposure to these diseases fostered a stronger immune system, but that ignores the exposure of tropical peoples to their diseases (malaria, etc.).  If Europeans could develop a better immune system from exposure to germs, why couldn't tropical tribes gain immunity from germs through their own exposure? Why didn't these new germs stop or significantly slow European expansion (which they did, but he doesn't deal with that very much). <br /> <br />There were also biases; he maintains that he feels many hunter gathers are more intelligent than most Europeans/Anglos.  He also seems too inclined to dismiss any human variable, as is evidenced by the half-baked way in which he deals with the GLARING exeption to his thesis--China.  China had all the advantages; huge population base, long unified, early domestication of plants and animals, navigable rivers, etc.  Everything that should have conspired against it being divided up at the colonial feast.  Yet, China was the play thing of Europe and Japan during the late stages of the great game.  He attempts (sort of) to deal with this, but in a confusing and unconvincing manner.  <br /> <br /> <br />This book is not a specialist work, at least as  I read it.  Most of the scholarship has been done elsewhere, piecemeal (again, look at the bibliography).  It is an introductory text to the spread of civilization, and a servicable one. It attempts to spell out prior scholarship in a way that those of us without specialties in all the related fields (e.g. ag, ethnobotany) can understand it.  However, one must read this book critically, and apply one's own knoweldge base to the arguments the author makes, as some of them simply seem illogical and/or incomplete.  As I said, the section dealing with the domestication of plants and animals, and the implications for society, make the book worth reading, but you have to be careful here; the author treads on dangerous, unproven ground attimes, and taking his ideas at face value would be dangerous.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Under My Skin is, to begin with, a lot heavier in scope than Let Go, featuring more guitar-oriented work and in all a more edgier feel. And it is fabulous, indeed. It makes Let Go sound a lot more tame in comparison. <br /> <br />My favorites are \\"Take Me Away\\", \\"He Wasn't\\", and \\"Nobody's Home\\", yet I think all the songs are as equally good. I believe Avril has definitely displayed a lot more potential in her material with a lot more personal lyrics which express her abilities and mishaps. Yet there is something to be said about her talents; they are utterly flawless, a 19-year-old making a name for herself is very interesting indeed. <br /> <br />Under My Skin is very much a gold nugget, and all I can say is \\"Nice work, Avril! Let's hope your third album will live up to this one's standards.\\"
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Recently I picked up Fiona Apple's second album, When The Pawn Hits The Conflicts He Thinks Like A King What He Knows Throws The Blows When He Goes To The Fight And He'll Win The Whole Thing `Fore He Enters The Ring There's No Body To Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand And Remember That Depth Is The Greatest Of Heights And If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where To Land And If You Fall It Won't Matter, Cuz You'll Know That You're Right....which is typically shortened to When the Pawn... I was inspired to do this by my recent listening to the unreleased Extraordinary Machine, which is floating around all over the internet, and I would buy in a heartbeat.<br /><br />So, When The Pawn... is another excellent album from Fiona. I've been listening to it mostly as I drive to and from work this week, and have fallen in love with a number of the tracks: \\"To Your Love\\", \\"Fast As You Can\\", \\"Limp\\", \\"Get Gone\\", and \\"A Mistake\\" are the ones which come to mind. Fiona has her own rather unique musical style, a mix of rock and blues and jazz and funk which complements her interesting and thoughtful lyrics.<br /><br />This is not dance music. The songs don't all sound the same. The lyrics don't read like they were written by a teenager. If that's not your cup of tea, perhaps you should move on.<br /><br />It's too bad that musical crap like Britney flourishes, while Fiona creates excellent music and is mostly ignored. Even the Grammy-winning Norah Jones can only aspire to be as thoughtful as this.<br /><br />So, in case you were wondering, I do recommend this album. ;)
B0008ISM40|3.0|The Fragile was brilliant and revolutionary.  With Teeth was bound to be disappointing by comparison, particularly after such a long wait.  The new CD sounds very conventional.  The sad thing is that it will probably be Trent's biggest commercial success.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Once an album has received more than a hundred reviews (the count is at 229 for \\"With Teeth\\" as of this writing), the law of averages starts to sink in. There will be those who praise it no matter what and there will be those who trash it irregardless of what you say to them. The truth is, in my humble opinion, that this is a return to NIN's roots, much in a line similar to \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". \\"That's great!\\", you may say. Not so fast, I say to you.<br /><br />Trent Reznor has been an artist whose albums have generally been proportional in power and intimacy to how tormented he is. With this album, Trent seems to have come out of the dark corners he was roaming around the turn of the century. The result, in spite of several very strong and LOUD NIN moments throughout it, is an album that pales by comparison with its predecessor double studio album (\\"The Fragile\\") or the iconic \\"Downward Spiral\\".<br /><br />I find some songs I can't stop playing: the opening (which is perhaps one of the most reminiscent of his debut album, \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\"), \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" and the two closing tracks. All in all, I will go with four stars on this one. I reserve the five stars in NIN's discography for his past works. Nevertheless, a very good album.

0316920045|4.0|The detail contained within this novel is staggering (as one might guess from the sheer heft of the book itself)--the hundred pages or so of footnotes, in tiny print, are amazing.  I found myself marveling, at several points while plowing through this literary monster, at the intricacies of the world DFW has created.  The concept of subsidized time, the slang, the \\"new technology\\" (most of which we already use in our everyday lives today), the political world of North America and the Quebec separatists.... If nothing else, you have to hand it to the author for even being able to come up with the bizarre and creative universe in which the book takes place. <br /> <br />However, if you're someone who has a desperate need for resolution at the ends of books and movies, you may want to steer clear.  There's nothing to give away in that department--no explosive denouement, no shock (except for maybe the fact that you've devoted so many hours to reading the incredibly long novel with infinite plots and realizing there's no way to tie them together).  However, I think the fact that there is no shock is a sort of sly \\"wink\\" by DFW to the reader; after all, one of the main themes in the novel has to do with entertainment--what qualifies as entertainment, how dependent American culture is on entertainment, etc.  Reading a novel is entertainment--so the fact that there's no convenient conclusion ought not upset us, since we've been entertained for hours and hours just by getting through the book.  While his version of American culture may be exaggerated, there is some truth to the notion of living and/or dying for the sake of entertainment.  <br /> <br />If you ever have a chance to read this novel for a college class or a book club, I highly recommend it.  I read it on advice from a friend who finished it and desperately needed someone to talk to about it.  I think by discussing it, there may be more clarity to so much information.   <br /> <br />So, a few suggestions when tackling this novel:  read all the footnotes, esp. the filmography of James Incandenza.  Read the book as quickly as you can while still retaining the insane amount of information--stuff from the beginning ties back to things at the end, and it's frustrating to have to go back when you vaguely remember something from 700 pages earlier being referenced later.  Have a dictionary handy.   <br />All in all, just enjoy the finely-drawn world that the author has created.  Don't expect too much in the way of tying up loose ends.  You won't have the chance to read many books like this one.
B0007Z4S4C|2.0|While better than his last effort (Dreamland) this album still disappoints.  It in know way compares to any previous Zeppelin work and I am not quite sure why so many wish to equate it with such.  With his place in rock cemented, he can make whatever type of music he wishes.  However, I have had enough of his current style and from here on out, will not be fooled again.  If this album was not put out by Robert Plant, it would be panned.  He has really not made a solid solo album since Pictures at Eleven.  Throughout his solo career, he has fluctuated between embracing and ignoring his Zeppelin work.  He is in the ignore mode now, based on his recent grammy snub and his need to \\"rework\\" most Zepplelin songs he plays in his current show. He is also often sarcastic in recent interviews regarding his past.  He sings at the end of \\"Calling To You\\" from his Fate Of Nations solo album, \\"Oh,Jimmy\\" !!  I take it in reference to Page's work with David Coverdale at the time.  Page must be amused by the work on Plant's new album and be thinking \\"Oh, Robert\\"!!.   Unless you are a diehard fan, skip this Plant effort.
0618526412|3.0|<br />The novel The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter shows how different people struggle with life. John Singer is unable to communicate with people because he is a deaf-mute and he cannot speak . Mick Kelly does not speak to her family because they do not share the intelligence and ambition she has .Biff Brannon is left alone after his wife dies . Dr. Copeland separated from his family and other black people because of his education and way of life . Jake Blount is  a newcomer in town and is mostly always alone . <br /> <br /> <br /> I really didn't like the book . The reason I didn't like the story is because it was too confusing . In the beginning the story is a little boring . I didn't like the ending because it was  too sad .  I also  though the characters were unrealistic. I don't think this would ever happen in real life. <br /> <br />  I gave The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter  three stars because overall it was a ok book ,but not a really good one . I would not recommend this book  because it is not that interesting.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|One of the previous reviewers of Mike Nichols' CLOSER called it \\"one of the most raw and honest portrayals of 21st century relationships.\\" Sorry if this offends you, ma'am, but if you find Patrick Marber's hopelessly sour depiction of 21st century relationships truthful---if you agree with his implicit argument that people in our modern times have lost the ability to truly love each other and be honest with each other in relationships, no matter how hard they may try to make a show of affection and honesty---then I can only imagine what hurt you've gone through in your romantic life to lead you to make a similar conclusion.    CLOSER is the sad chronicle of four lives ruined by cheating, lying, and manipulation. Anna the photographer (Julia Roberts) breaks the heart of Larry the dermatologist (Clive Owen) by sleeping with Dan the writer (Jude Law), who himself breaks the heart of Alice the stripper (Natalie Portman). The movie basically follows these four characters as they all hurt each other, some willingly, some unwillingly. There are very few scenes that elicit any sense of hope for these people; they remain self-absorbed and plain selfish from beginning to end.    So, these are not very likable characters. Not a problem, necessarily; I've seen plenty of movies and TV shows in the past that have had unappealing characters, but have been so well written and insightfully performed that I nevertheless feel compelled to observe these characters during the course of the film or episode. (An example: the hit TV show \\"Everybody Loves Raymond\\" can sometimes make you wince more than laugh---especially when someone get Patricia Heaton's Debra Barone angry!---but I still maintain an admiration for its occasional priceless insights into family life, even in the midst of crazy family dysfunction.) Likewise, I might have accepted the bald manipulations of these four nasty specimens more readily if the movie actually highlighted some startling truths about modern relationships. The cynical side of me is perfectly willing to accept the filmmakers' notion that people these days have become a little more selfish in love. But the way Marber presents his thesis here, there is no connection to anything resembling real life---especially in his dialogue, which can be impressive when it doesn't simply sound all-too-written---to ground his misanthropic ideas in some kind of realistic footing. The result is a movie that seems less like an expose of harsh truths, more like a grotesque fantasy about glamorous people mindlessly inflicting terrible emotional pain on each other.    I can't really fault the performances, though---at least Natalie Portman's and Clive Owen's. It was an inspired decision to cast the innocent-looking Portman as the stripper who gets hurt by Dan and wisens up considerably afterwards; Portman relays an occasionally touching vulnerability (although, admittedly, that is the only note Portman really emphasizes in her performance here), and Nichols smartly mines it for irony in the film's closing scenes. Clive Owen also burrows into his role with all the intensity and emotional honesty he can find from a role that requires him to be hurt and angry in one scene, and then coldly vengeful the next, almost on a dime. As for Jude Law and Julia Roberts...well, Law plays his character like such a sensitive fellow that you sometimes can't believe that this timid-seeming man could brutally hurt Alice the way he does. And while Roberts effectively dials down the movie-star wattage here, she does seem somewhat ill at ease in parts of this movie. When she hurls sexual obscenities at Larry in one scene, Roberts' delivery makes those words sting with all the power of a dead bee.    But perhaps one shouldn't blame Law or Roberts if they have trouble giving consistent performances in this movie. Their roles are in the service of a shallow vision of modern relationships that seems so divorced from any sense of reality that any actor might have trouble trying to find any kind of emotional truth in this kind of role. I expected CLOSER to be edgy and compelling; it is both, but it is also witless and frankly pointless, in my opinion. Forget the hype; you can easily skip this one.
6301208773|4.0|I was never one for action movies. Your Rambos, your Conans, guys who were so superhuman as heroes it was hard to relate to them, let alone root for them. But then came Die Hard, and a new action hero emerged: a pretty regular guy who's smart enough to call for help and insightful enough to realize there's a good chance he ain't making it out of this movie alive.  <br /> <br />Bruce Willis is John McClane, a New York cop trying to reconcile with his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedilia in fine form) over Christmas. He arrives at her skyscraper office building on Christmas Eve, where she and her co-workers are having a party. Little do they know that a group of very slick and experienced \\"terrorists\\" have targeted them for a high-financed robbery. It's only through sheer luck that McClane manages not to be taken hostage, but this lucky chance also leaves him bare-footed (you'll have to watch to see why, takes too long to explain), without a shirt, and only his service revolver against 11 armed and extrememly dangerous guys. More dangerous than their all their machine guns put together is their leader, Hans Gruber (a delicously suave Alan Rickman,) whose cool intellect and icy indifference to life, even the lives of his own men, make him one tough dude to rattle. He's planned this heist down to the second. But even the best laid plans go wrong.... <br /> <br />Willis is great. He's funny, sarcastic and despite his vulgarity, it's obvious he's pretty smart too. It's his brains that he ends up having to rely on for the better part of the movie, since he's woefully outgunned, and the cops outside aren't able to help. His CB conversations with Hans are classic, as are the expressions on Hans' face as he slowly realizes McClane is not some dumb Irish flatfoot just giving him grief, but a formidable opponent who's causing the whole plan to go awry. McClane also isn't afraid to call for help, express his emotions (his plea to Sgt. Powell to talk to his wife if he doesn't make it out alive is suprisingly touching,) and experience despair. Willis gives this character ringing sincerity. He makes McClane into someone the audience can really get behind, because we understand him. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is great. Rickman's Hans is a villan you both hate and kinda like, because he's just so damn urbane. Bonnie Bedilia hardly screams, and has no trouble facing down her captors. Hart Brockner is great as the slimy Ellis, who tries to sell-out McClane and ends up with just desserts, and Alexander Gudanov is primal male rage as Karl, Hans' trusted 2nd man. William Atherton, who always does a great toady, doesn't let down his fans here as the overambitious reporter covering the take-over. But it's Reginald VelJohnson who shines as Al Powell, the cop who's McClane's only link to the outside and his only supporter. <br /> <br />If I have one complaint with the film, it's that in order to paint McClane more the hero, it makes the LAPD and FBI look like macho, bumbling morons. That was unneccessary. The movie more than explains why the police are rendered ineffective (it has to do with Hans' grand master plan.) They didn't need to be portrayed as incompetents.  <br /> <br />There's also plenty of explosions, gun-fights, hand to hand combats and a grand showdown between McClane and Hans to keep the action enthusiasts happy. Even though some scenes are improbable, they're still very enjoyable.  <br /> <br />Die Hard set the mold for a new breed of action films, and it's to be commended for that. I think I'll be adding it to my Christmas movie line-up, along with \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"The Christmas Story.\\" Maybe instead of wishing people a Merry Christmas, I'll be saying \\"Yip-ie-kay-ay, motherf****r!\\"
B00025ETIW|5.0|OK I USUALLY DONT GET REALLY EXITED OVER A CD, I LISTEN TO A CD FOR A MONTH THEN I GET TIRED OF IT. BUT THIS CD ROCKS! I AM A BEGINNER ARTIST AND MUSIC IS MY THING AND WHEN I SAY SOMTHING IS AWESOME IT IS!PLUS THE GUITARING IS CRAZY I CANT PLAY ALONG WITH THE TABS, ITS SO FAST SO IF YALL LIKE ROCK MUSIC YALL WILL LOVE THIS!
B000002TQV|5.0|This album, from start to finish, is so accessible that i have to say it's better than Ok Computer. My personal favourite is The Bends, but every song on this album (except Planet) has been my favourite at one time. Each song is different. Changing from the kinda weird sounding Planet Telex to the pop-sounding The Bends. Then, High and Dry and Fake Plastic Trees are soft sounding. All the way down to Street Spirit, this album remain solid. I personally enjoy Radiohead's early three albums more then post- Ok Computer because of it's experimental sounds( but they're still awesome albums). This album is one of my personal favourites along with Oasis' Definately Maybe, Weezer's Blue Album, Pavement's Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain (which i recommend to all Radiohead fans) and the just released Funeral.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I agree with everyone with this review, (when i say everyone i mean the smart, cool people who say this band sucks).  Jee these guys suck so bad.  Mix metal and rap and you come up with some bad genre of music called nu metal...korn slipknot, they suck, all show no talent, listen to METALLICA, OZZY, BLACK SABBATH, AC/DC or even nirvana, or children of bodom, theres music worth your time... without metallica or your black sabbaths or your judas preists, you wouldnt be reading this.
B00000099Y|5.0|I can honestly say that Tool's Aenima and Deftone's White Pony are my two favorite albums of all time. Passenger, on White Pony, that combines both Maynard and  Chino is probably my favorite song.  <br /> <br />Anyone who can find one flaw in this album should have their head examined. I normally am not cocky like this, but give the album a listen and you will understand why. <br /> <br />Also reccomended:  <br /> <br />Around the Fur - Deftones <br />Lateralus - Tool <br />Mer de Noms - A Perfect Circle
B00006F7S4|4.0|This is my favorite and IMO the best Beck album. Im not a huge fan of his goofy techno dabbling that are often hit or miss and an acquired taste. This album is a lot more instrumental in the traditional sense. There is still techno dabbling, but it is kept in the background to Beck's monotone singing and his acoustive guitar. There is even some slide guitar used on the 3rd or 4th song.    The only detraction is the depressing nature of the album and the fact that some of the acoustic pieces sound a little similar.    This is the album that shows Beck is capable of writing a very good song and isnt just a gimmicky artist who hides behind studio controls and effects.     Highlights: Doint Time, Lost Cause, The Golden Age, Lonesome Tears
B00004Z459|2.0|This album is garbage. Linkin Park is horrible live, they have no talent. There voice is overedited in the studio. They have catchy songs, songs that get old after the 5th listen. This is NOT real music. <br /> <br />I'd also like to state the customers that liked this item also enjoyed: <br />    <br />    * Staind <br />    * Evanescence <br />    * Hoobastank <br />    * Korn <br />    * Trapt  <br /> <br />Is that enough proof? Go listen to Tool or Deftones.
B000002UA9|3.0|PLEASE PLEASE ME was a formulaic release in 1963.  Band scores a hit single, record company orders a quick album built around that song.  We all know by now that The Beatles recorded their debut in a day.  However, this is no rush job.  The performances are vibrant.  Their singing -- The Beatles' greatest strength next to their songwriting -- shine on almost every track.  The band (playing live in the studio) is exciting and focussed.  This is a band on a mission.<br />I Saw Her Standing There still rocks with Paul's exciting &quot;1, 2, 3, four!&quot; count-in, and Twist and Shouts demands to be played LOUD on every sound system in the world.  Though the singles, Please Please Me, Ask Me Why, Misery and P.S. I Love You are good tunes, other Lennon/McCartney originals, There's A Place and even Love Me Do are weaker efforts that only hint at something better.  Do You Want To Know A Secret? is merely a ditty that George tries to sing in his thick Scouse accent.<br />Half the album is awarded to cover versions.  The best are the window-rattling Twist and Shout and the genteel Taste of Honey.  However, there were better choices in the Beatles' live repetoire besides Chains and Boys.  Why not Too Much Monkey Business or Soldier of Love?<br />Taken for what it is, this is a good album announcing the talents of a band that in three short years will produce the greatest album of all time, Revolver.
B00000JCB2|1.0|There should be. Limp Bizkit is indescribably horrible. If you can stand Fred Durst's voice for 2 consecutive seconds, you have an amazing talent. Go show it off on \\"Ripley's Believe it or Not\\".
B000002L80|5.0|I adore Remain In Light, enjoy Speaking In Tongues, love Psycho Killer.  But LITTLE CREATURES is my favourite Heads album.  I know many Heads' fans don't, because LC doesn't sound like anything else they ever did.  It's melodic, bouncy, bright and optimistic.  Little Creatures is like the Velvets' LOADED, a pop record made by an avant-rock band.<br />Reportedly, David Byrne was in love (with Adelle Lutz) when he composed these tunes.  That's evident from the get-go.  And She Was kicks off the album on a note of joy and energy, not dark brooding like Burning Down The House.  From there, the record detours into kids &amp; family (Creatures of Love, Stay Up Late) and more love (the wonderful The Lady Don't Mind).<br />The hooks are catchy and the harmonies are delicious.  Further, every song moves.  You can dance to this.  There's no filler.  The sequencing is smart -- the record is assembled like one unified piece.<br />LITTLE CREATURES isn't everyone's cup of tea, but who says a band has to sound the same on every album?
B000002U82|5.0|\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is a true musical work of art.  With classics like \\"Money\\", \\"Time\\", and \\"Brain Damage\\" it is easy to see why.

Thank you David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and Syd Barret, for giving us your beautiful and brilliant music.
B00006AW2L|3.0|It's a pity that the Stones CDs weren't released like the Beatles' ones, that is in their original British incarnations with 14 songs per album, not as 11-track rip-offs.  Still, it's hard to diss a collection that kicks off with Paint It Black and includes Lady Jane, Under My Thumb and I Am Waiting.  My point is, There's something better out there.
B000002572|5.0|Classic 70's albums bring into mind Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, Led Zeppelin's fourth album, and Blondie's Parallel Lines, to name a few.  Add to that Boston's debut album, which sold 16 million copies in the US and was in the album charts for two years.  Much of the success was due to the intelligent songwriting of Tom Scholz and rock vocals of Brad Delp, who by the time of their third album Third Stage, were the only two from the original lineup left.<br /><br />The remembrances of summers past and a girl named Marianne is embodied in their first single \\"More Than A Feeling,\\" one of the best known rock singles of the 70's.  Reaching #5 in 1976, it featured all the components that made Boston a force to be reckoned with.  Delp's soaring vocals, accompaniment from other members, and Tom Scholz's distinctive squealing and revved guitars, particularly during the chorus.<br /><br />\\"Peace Of Mind,\\" the third single, which barely showed its face in the Top 40 (#38), is more a rocker throughout.  It's a song showing the wisdom of not getting caught up with the fierce competition in the music world:  /Can'tcha you see there'll come a day when it won't matter/Come a day when you'll be gone/  I sometimes find myself liking this song more than \\"More Than A Feeling.\\"  Why didn't this get into the Top 5 as well?<br /><br />The second single, \\"Long Time,\\" has as an accompanying prelude \\"Foreplay,\\" with its rambling organ solo and snarling guitars.  After 2 mins 23 seconds, \\"Long Time\\" begins with a squealing guitar and Brad singing.  This #22 song has the long-term dream or vision, much like \\"Peace of Mind\\" and the need to move on from one place to another to find it.  The \\"got to move on\\" dynamic is also explored in \\"Hitch A Ride,\\" only on a more cosmic level, where hitching a ride to the other side and leaving for the last time is the final departure.<br /><br />\\"Rock N Roll Band\\" is an autobiographic song of how the band made it from local gigs till their discovery.  Just as engaging if not more than  \\"Peace of Mind.\\"  There are some nods to old-fashion R&R in the verses of the jamming \\"Smokin'.\\"  Jamming, or should I say smoking?<br /><br />All the songs are singleworthy, due to a consistent strong guitar, heavy bass, drums, in other words, the forerunner of what would later be termed arena rock.

B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I am a huge Led Zeppelin fan and recently I have been getting more into Robert after Zeppelin. So far I haven't seen anything that was anywhere close to Zeppelin, until now. I love this album. When I first heard it it blew me away. Robert wasn't lying when he said it was \\"Physical Graffiti\\" gone to Cairo. It is a mix between the Middle Eastrn feel of \\"Dreamland\\" and the diversity and power that was in \\"Physical Graffiti\\". He has songs such as \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" and \\"Freedom Fries\\" that are like the powerful songs in the early days of Zep and others like \\"All the King's Horses\\" that resemble such Zep classics as \\"Going to California\\". One song, \\"Tin Pan Valley\\", sounds a lot like a modern day metal song. I also love how he was able to put so many different musical styles into one album. Much of it has a Middle Eastern feel and include many foreign instruments. Robert still has an outstanding voice (even though it doesn't quite have the same power and range) and he chose a fantastic band. If there was one album of Robert's since Led Zeppelin to get, this is definately the one.
B000063DFQ|4.0|This, of course is the first Iron Maiden album featuring the \\"classic\\" lineup of Steve, Dave, Adrian, Bruce and Nicko.  For that reason alone, Piece of Mind is worth owning, although of the four albums this lineup did this is the weakest in my opinion. <br /> <br />But I have to say that this albums good moments are really, really good.  The track arrangement is, in my opinion, a little goofy; they start off with \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", which gets the album galloping along, only to follow it with \\"Revelations.\\"  It's a great song, but it stalls the album's momentum.  But that's only temporary, from \\"Flight of Icarus\\" through \\"The Trooper\\" the album just rolls right along. <br /> <br />Okay, now for the really bad part.  Three words:  \\"Quest for Fire.\\"  This is easily the cheesiest song in the entire Maiden catalog (as I recall, the film of the same name is also pretty bad). <br /> <br />If you want the whole catalog, well, you gotta buy this one anyway.  But, at least for tracks 2-5, it's worth having.
B000929AJQ|2.0|Can someone please tell me why Trent Reznor decided not to release this album under a different band name, because Nine Inch Nails is not applicable.  There is only one song on this album that even resembles the NiN we all grew to love (that being \\"You Know What You Are\\").  The other tracks do little to inspire me to truly rebel and bite \\"The Hand That Feeds\\". <br /> <br />Now if this album was released under a different band name, thus suggesting a different sound or even a different genre, then I would definitely be more acceptable to the change in direction.  Perhaps this album would even be better received -- more of a dark lounge-music soundtrack which is in sharp contrast to NiN's previous and more widely known despair and decaying industrial anthems which we were eager to march (and relate) to.  But I imagine what we are witnessing is Trent morphing the image of Nine Inch Nails from being this revolutionary, powerful, dark, industrial entity to represent no more than a musical biography of his own trials and evolution through life. <br /> <br />I don't know about other NiN fans but I prefered it when the band's image stood for something separate than the person's.  Unfortunately since Trent has always been the entire band we were doomed from the start to end like this.  Then again this may cause us to appreciate NiN's older material even more (since we will never once reach that pinnacle of decadence again).
B0007KTBIU|4.0|This review is tough to write. Firstly, this dvd was sent to me \\"free\\" via Amazon for being the amazing reviewer I am:) Well, it was sent to me free, anyway, there is a such thing as a free lunch! <br /> <br />This definitely is not a dvd I would have purchased for myself. Not because I do not like animation, but because of the subject matter and from clips I had seen. However, I was surprised. Not overwhelmed, but surprised. The voice casting is very strong in the starring roles however the animal cast aimed obviously at the youngsters did sort of grate. The animation as far as backdrops were often stunning and are Disneys general level of perfection, not quite Lion King but still very good. The extra's are certainly more than I would expect from a movie not quite a blockbuster and pretty much nail all the loose ends fans of this movie could ever hope to see. <br /> <br />Still, having almost nothing negative to say I still get a feeling this movie is aimed at youngsters. There is an interesting story underneath but it is layered under an icing more suited for a young pallette. It goes without saying that if you are a Disney-hound or a small girl, this DVD set is a must, all others should wait... and hope.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is probably the best sci-fi show ever created.

I was lucky enough to attend a special \\"hardcore fans only\\" screening of this movie (which will not be commercially released into theaters until September 30th, 2005). The movie is a PERFECT ending to the TV show which was sadly cut short due to being in a bad time slot and Fox's inability to air the episodes in order. While the TV show is incredibly action packed, the movie will not leave you dissappointed!!!!<br /><br />BUY THE DVDS THEN MAKE SURE TO SEE \\"SERENITY\\" SEPTEMBER 30TH!!!!
B00081U6EG|4.0|Great looking/sounding concert featuring some major players in the history of the Stratocaster.  Buddy Holly's band, the Crickets led by Sonny Curtis sing Buddy's hits and legendary British guitar instrumentalist, Hank Marvin shows why he's a legend(at least in Britain.)  Paul Carrack and Mike Rutherford(Mike and the Mechanics) sound great. There's a lot of fine music here but why only one song from Gary Moore - the best guitarist in the show. And why on a program dedicated to the Fender Strat,does Jamie Cullum do a song without any guitar whatsoever? That seems odd.
B00004STPT|5.0|I enjoyed Gladiator a lot, and this soundtrack is part of the reason.  The orchestral arrangements are haunting, dark, and very powerful.  If you liked the movie, you will definitely like this.  It captures the mood of the movie perfectly, especially because of the power and majesty of the arrangements.  It holds up very well to repeat listens, it is very dark and kind of scary sometimes in a creepy way, like the movie was.  Overall, this is a great cd that should not be missed, and any fans of the movie should get this too.

When the closing credits came on, my jaw literally dropped because I did not want the movie to be over. I was completely engrossed in the movie and not at all prepared for it to end. Now I want to see the original...
0553801481|4.0|Robin Hobb, Fool's Errand (Bantam, 2002)<br /><br />Robin Hobb has, not surprisingly, done it again. Fool's Errand, the first book in the Tawny Man trilogy, is wonderful. The main characters from the Farseer books are back, but that doesn't stop her treading into Liveship Traders territory enough to draw in the fans of that series as well, and the whole makes for a wonderful introduction to the two books that follow it.<br /><br />The time is fifteen years after the events in Assassin's Quest, and an unknown but short time after the events in Ship of Destiny (certainly no more than a year). Fitz has spent a good deal of the last decade and a half in seclusion, living in a previously-abandoned cottage not far outside Forge, renouncing both his heritage and the duties of his office following the Red Ship War. As we open, Kettricken is in the process of negotiating a trade alliance with the Outislanders that will involve the betrothal of her son, Dutiful, to a noble daughter of an Outisland clan. Fitz is approached first by Chade, then by the Tawny Man himself (if you don't know who the Tawny Man is-- and it's a pretty simple process of elimination if you're familiar with the first trilogy-- I'll not spoil the surprise for you), requesting he come back to Buckkeep as a teacher and mentor for the prince. Fitz, now living under the name Tom Badgerlock, refuses until a nameless rider beings bad tidings, and Fitz is once again forced to take up the role he has always played-- the Catalyst to the White Prophet.<br /><br />That Hobb's writing is great swords-and-sorcery is no secret to anyone who's been reading her stuff. Now, though, she's got the full wight of twenty-five hundred pages apiece of two trilogies behind her, and five thousand rich, detailed pages of worldbuilding, and that just makes it all the better. Hobb does do the whole \\"flashback to reacquaint the reader with stuff\\" thing that's been so annoying in, say, recent novels by Terry Goodkind, but here it's far less obtrusive; Hobb doesn't assume that her readers have the same memory span as your average goldfish, and the premise of intelligence by the writer on the part of the reader is certainly refreshing. The only question is, if Hobb can spend five hundred pages on this, which seems a rather minor incident in the greater scheme of this story, how on earth is she going to get the whole thing told in only two more books? (A quick check at Amazon reveals part of the answer; they're both much longer than this seemingly introductory volume.) In any case, I can't wait to find out. ****'s far less obtrusive; Hobb doesn't assume that her readers have the same memory span as your average goldfish, and the premise of intelligence by the writer on the part of the reader is certainly refreshing.

Every high school and college kid should  read this! Stephen Ambrose said many times that the WW2 vets were giants among men who just wanted to be regular guys.

B00003CXSP|1.0|Hannibal (Ridley Scott, 2001)<br /><br />Really, the first question you have to ask yourself is, \\"what were these people thinking?\\" Four-time Oscar nominee Julianne Moore, Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins, Oscar nominee Giancarlo Giannini, critical darling Gary Oldman (who should have already won at least two Oscars by now), and Golden Globe nominee Ray Liotta manage to embarrass themselves in front of the camera, while Oscar winner Ridley Scott and Oscar nominee David Mamet (of all people to adapt Harris' novel, why Mamet?) do the same in the rear. All of these people have proven themselves, in some cases many times over, as brilliant workers in film. I mean, Ridley Scott has directed both one of the finest horror films and one of the finest science fiction films of all time. Mamet's House of Games is one of the finest films ever made in any genre. The actors speak for themselves.<br /><br />I assume what they were all thinking is that Hannibal could be Silence of the Lambs II. The problem being that Ted Tally took Thomas Harris' almost aggressively mediocre novel and made something great out of it, and neither Tally nor Jonathan Demme was all too slavish about keeping things Harris-ized. Mamet and Scott, on the other hand, were slavish to Harris' even more aggressively mediocre novel in all the wrong places. Worse, they took the only part of the novel that really worked and destroyed it. I'd put off seeing Hannibal for four years because I expected it to be bad, but I certainly didn't expect the travesty that I actually got.<br /><br />There is, to be fair, some decent acting. All of it, every last bit, comes from Anthony Hopkins, who here still manages to keep Hannibal Lecter from being a complete self-parody (as he was in Red Dragon the year following). The rest of the cast can be written off. Had Hannibal been a one-man play, it would likely have been far more satisfying.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs. *

B0001IN0DA|3.0|Personally, I thought Wrestlemania XX was one of the biggest mixed bags of good and horrible I've ever seen in wrestling.  I'll review the card and explain this description.   <br /> <br />Match 1 - The Big Show (C) vs. John Cena: US Championship (SD) <br />Overall this was a good match to start the show with.  It was painfully obvious that Cena was going to win, but it was still good.  My ionly real knock on this match is that Big Show was ruined.  A guy half his size was able to give him aDeath Valley Driver (FU) TWICE without much difficulty and I know he did it at least twice on TV prior to this show.  In this day and age, slamming big super heavyweights means nothing.  Hulk slamming Andre was special, Luger slamming Yokozuna was special, but nobody cares about this because A) Big Show has been slammed 14 dozen times by smaller guys and B) John Cena had already done it before.  OK that's my rant about the poor use of big men in wrestling today.  Other than that this was a nice fun match with an expected title change.   <br /> <br />Match 2 - RVD/Booker T (c) vs. La Resistance vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Cade/Jindrak: Raw Tag Team Championship <br />Utterly depressing to see Booker T and RVD going for tag team gold as they are both clearly above it.  Anyways this match was only an excuse to cram 8 guys onto the card, but was good for what it was.  Booker and RVD retained, but I think I would have given it to La Resistance.   <br /> <br />Match 3 - Chris Jericho vs. Christian (Raw) <br />I wasn't a big fan of the Love Triangle with these two and Trish (I've seen way too many of them) but this match was quite good.  It's certainly the best match on the undercard, and I'd say it's the second best on the card as a whole.  These two really worked well together, and it would be the first of several good matches that these two would have in 2004.  Trish's turn on Jericho was expected and nicely done.  My only knock on this match, and it isn't even really a knock on the match, but it marked Jericho's 3rd Wrestlemania loss in a row.  Poor Chris.  Very good match.   <br /> <br />Match 4 - The Rock and Sock Connection vs. Evolution (Raw) <br />On the DVD extras, Foley says in his post match comments that he was

I would love to give it a billion stars if only I could. I really suggest you buy every single DVD season (including this one) just like I did! Gilmore Girls is my absolute favorite show of all times, and I may admit, this season is showing you to get to know the Gilmores. It teaches you the true Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. Contact me if you're over obsesser like I am. It's truly the bestestestest show E-V-E-R!!! Enjoy the DVD just like I did, enjoy it, pal!
B0000025T6|5.0|When I first heard Springsteen as a 9 year old it was all Born In The USA and it was so overexposed that it got old real fast and made me feel a bit \\"over\\" the pseudo-celebratory crap it was used to celebrate/promote in the US.Not that the songwriter intended it that way... <br />Fast forward a few years and my brother picked up Nebraska.It sounded way different but I still wasn't interested.A few years ago I met a guy who raved about Nebraska in a pub in Melbourne and in a moment of alcoholic inspiration bought a copy. <br />A few years on and I can safely say that it is one of the best purchases I've made.The music is raw, delicate, painful and HUMAN!! A look at the sometimes seemingly pointless grind of our existence from the angles of normal people.

This season is filled with teary-eyed moments, terrible fears, surprising dreams, heart-warming stories, and amazing mother and daughter relationships. It's deftiniely one you shouldn't go without missing! Rory is going off to college! Anyways, buy everything Gilmore Girls and you'll be extremely happy!

B0007GAERG|5.0|I was just reading some recent reviews and while almost all are positive i still came accross a couple negative ones.  One i found particularly rediculous and couldn't help but coment on it.  The reviewer began by ranting and raving that this cd doesn't sound like mariahs first several cds and how that upset them.  Well that's called growth.  Times change and music changes with it!  The music of the 90's was amazing but it's not what is hot at the moment so if singers want to continue to be succesfull they have to change with the times.  After all who wants to record the same exact music every single time.  i know i wouldn't.  Further more i feel that mariah is one of the few artists that has been able to change with the times and still stay true to what she enjoys doing and the type of music her fans have always loved!  This cd is not at all a departure from her true self but just an example of the way mariahs always sang brought into the year 2005.   <br /> <br />The thing that really annoyed me about this particular review was not that the person was just longing for 90's mariah sounds but that they went so far as to insult mariahs voice and say that there was something wrong with it!  How ridiculous!  They were upset that mariah isn't singing the song vision of love over and over again so they began to insult the way she sings saying that her voice is ruined and she needs help immediately.  Well the only person who needs help is the person writing that review!  Anyone who has heard this cd can attest that there is absolutely nothing wrong with mariahs voice!  It sounds bold, beautiful, and magnificent as always! All i have to say to this person is please stop writing reviews that have absolutely no factual bases to them what so ever.  mariah's voice sounds no different than when she first started!  Also absolutely no one agrees with your opinion concidering the cd is doing extraordinarily well (already sold a million copies and has had 2 huge singles from the album)!   <br /> <br />Here's my review of the songs on a 1-5 scale (including the japan bonus tracks) <br /> <br />It's like that   5/5 <br />We belong together 5/5 <br />Shake it off  5/5 <br />Mine again 5/5 <br />Say something  5/5 <br />Stay the night  5/5 <br />Get your number  5/5 <br />One and only   4/5 <br />Circles 4/5 <br />Your girl 5/5 <br />I wish you knew 4/5 <br />To the floor 4/5 <br />Joy ride 2/5 <br />Fly like a bird 5/5 <br />Sprung (bonus track for UK and Japan)  5/5 <br />Secret love (bonus track for Japan only)  5/5

0807126063|5.0|I found this little book on a $1.99 table and read about the accolades. Bought it ($2.12 including Indiana tax). read it, CONSUMED IT, loved it. A perfectly magnificent book about a perfectly magnificent fellow and his permutations. I cannot say enough about the use of conversational English and the use of absurdist situations to convey the free/futile situations that Ignatious finds himself in. Mom worship, self-deprecation, sappy attention to the old who should have been moved on years ago,attention to detail...all strong, serious, intelligent reasons to read this book. This book literaly changed the way I look at me, at you, at the people we influence and are influenced by....I saw human nature at its belt line and I approved and disapproved while being mightily entertained.At the end Ignatius ends up just being another adolesant who moves, grooves, and behooves according to the mores of his time. I cannot think of another character who caused me to relate so completly. (Ok, Maybe Holden Caulfield) Loved this book. They have been trying to make a movie of this forever. I want to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Ignatius. Perfect casting that.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I say this with the utmost humility...this show is one of the best I've ever seen.   The acting is fresh and alive, the stories are intrigueing and the writing is first rate.
B000002552|4.0|...\\"The Basement Tapes\\" are a wonder no matter who composed them. I just love the songs. Brilliant. This is an odd little slice of Americana constructed by a group (The Band) and an Iconic Leader (Dylan) who were completely steeped in the traditions of folk, country, and rock. The songs can seem difficult on first listen because they are not polished up and glittering with studio tricks. They are just honest songs from the heart of America and Canada that reach out and attempt to open your soul. Repeated listens will solidify the humor, faith, and pain that went into constructing this album. Highly recommended.
B00008CLOA|5.0|the dark side of the moon is the greatest rock album ever made and is the second highest selling album of all time.hugely recommended along with wish you were here and the wall.

B000002G87|4.0|EC was not messin around here. He starts off with a few songs written by both himself and Bobby Whitlock and jumps right into another Clapton REMASTERED with \\"Nobody Knows You When Your Down and Out.\\" An excellent new version of a song originally written by James Cox. Among his other remastered songs on Layla is \\"Little Wing\\" written by the late great left handed guitarist Jimi Hendrix. Which is personally my favorite track on this album. Maybe I'm just too big of a Hendrix fan but he knows how to write blues songs and Clapton and Duane Allman certainally knows his blues guitar solos. That's pretty much what this album comes down to, BLUES GUITAR SOLOS. Great ones, especially on the opening track, \\"I Looked Away\\" and one of Claptons distictive riffs with \\"Layla\\". Yep if you love blues style guitar solos you will definetly not be disappointed at all. Blues....
B000002HFU|4.0|I'm going to be honest here. I won't pretend (like a lot of people might) that I've been a loyal, die-hard ODB fan ever since the Wu-Tang's inception, because I haven't. I won't say that this entire CD is flawless and wholly astounding, because I believe some of its songs are better than others. What I will say is that I believe Ol' Dirty was the number one Wu-Tang artist (and that's definitely saying something, because all of them are outstanding), and that this solo effort is an extraordinary album. My personal favorite track is \\"Protect Ya Neck II,\\" followed closely by \\"Shimmy Shimmy Ya.\\" ODB had a remarkably unique style, and his gruff vocals always command your full attention and never fail to entertain. His premature death was very sad, and now whenever I listen to his songs or his verses in collective Wu-Tang songs, it always evokes some sorrow that he's gone. Still, it doesn't mar his material; nothing could. If you're a pop-rap lover who adores pseudo-rappers like Nelly and Cassidy and spurns the heroes like Snoop (old-school Snoop, that is), Dre, Cube, and the Wu, then this album probably won't suit your tastes. But to the more fastidious rap fans out there: Get this album, along with some of the Wu's other stuff (especially Enter the Wu-Tang).  <br /> <br />PS: Don't listen to the insensate naysayers like \\"Helen.\\" Just look at her naive, gushing reviews for Nelly's \\"Sweat/Suit.\\" She seems to think that Nelly has a singing voice worthy of idolatry, and that this makes him the finest rapper ever to grace the Earth (...). People like her know NOTHING about rap.
0807014265|2.0|Let me start by saying that this book does not belong to \\"My Favorite Books\\" bookshelf. I started reading this book for couple of reasons. One ... the central idea behind this book was referred by one of my favorite Authors (Stephen R Covey) in one of my favorite books viz \\"Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\\". Secondly, the title of this book was extremely seductive \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\". (Who does not want to know meaning of life?)    This book is primarily divided into two parts. The first part is more of an autobiography of the Author(Victor E. Frankl). Second part is dedicated to \\"Logotherapy\\".    As regards to the 1st part, I found the narration a bit dry. I think the Author did his best to put forward his life as dramatically as possible, however it does not stand out. As much as I sympathize with the Author for what he went through, I felt that he was being a bit boastful at times. I was specially disappointed to see that he was putting down some of his comrades to show how superior he was. The Author also also failed to explain how Logotherapy therapy helped him during his tough times.    The second part is on Logotherapy, which is nothing but a \\"bowl of spaghetti\\". The ideas are not very well organized. Whatever is put forward is not sufficiently substantiated with reasoning or facts. Author has tried to use some high-sounding words to make it sound something superior, but I guess the Author failed miserably. The Logotherapy that is referred in second part has no reference in the first part. So it is difficult to make any correlation between the two parts of the book.    If there is anything to learn from this book, it is ... \\"If you have a *why* in life, you will go through any *how* to achieve it.\\". So effectively, to find meaning in life, find out what is your final goal and let it direct you.    Overall I found this book disappointing :-(    -Sachin

B00006SFLV|4.0|this show was a outstanding when it camed to quality.and the reason why it had such quality was because it was focused in one area.wich is what may have killed it let me explain.<br /><br />the show had a verry narrow scope,it only captured the angst of alienated,grunge listening,middle class white female teenagers.which is why the show was so good it wasn't all over the place it just focused on one target white female teens.<br /><br />some may say this should'nt stop teens from other demographics from relating to the show.yeah thats true but for the most part kids outside angst ridden white female teenagers didn't connect with the show.wich is why i think their vewing audience was small(acording to the network)<br /><br />think about it, can white female teens relate to movies like \\"our song\\",\\"strait out of brooklyn\\",\\"mi vida loca\\" or \\"fresh\\"? i don't think they can.MAYBE if my so called life had broaden its scope,while maintaining the quality of the show it might have lasted longer.

B0008GNJZY|5.0|In Coach Carter, Samuel L. Jackson plays the role of Coach Ken Carter.  He's a very strict coach who takes over the head coaching job at a high school in a bad part of Richmond.  To be on his team, he demands that you sit in the front row of class, wear a tie, and maintain at least a C average.  Doesn't sound like much to most people, but to these kids growing up in a bad neighborhood, this definitely isn't easy.  Eventually Coach Carter locks the gym, cancels some of the biggest games of the year, and send all of his players to the library after getting their progress reports.  The city riots while the players study.  I'll let you see what happens in one of the best sports dramas.<br /><br />The good part about this movie is it really keeps you interested.  Friday Night Lights lost my attention early because it seemed to be more of a documentary.  Some people can relate to this movie.  Teachers and coaches can have a field day with what Carter says:  \\"In student athlete, student comes before athlete.\\"  We've all heard it before, but have we ever really listened?  Coach Carter's strong role definitely gets the message across in drastic fashion.  If you love sports dramas, you'll love this one.  The way I rate movies is how much they keep me entertained and interested.  I love sports dramas like this.  This matches up, if not tops, Remember the Titans.  Friday Night Lights is pretty easily beaten in my opinion.<br /><br />If you're not sure, rent it when it comes out on DVD and then buy it, but I will be buying it when it comes out.  This is a great film.  I don't know how the whole Oscar system works, but if Coach Carter can get any awards at next year's show, I think it should.  The best part about this movie is to realize afterwards that this is a true story.  This actually happened.  A coach canceled some of the biggest games of the year for his players' grades.<br /><br />If you're in any kind of business or a coach, would you sacrifice the biggest deal or game of the year for someone else?  Not many would, but Coach Carter takes this to extremes.  Sit back and relax and enjoy this one.  If you don't watch this soon, you may regret it.  Now go find it in a theater somewhere.someone else?  Not many would, but Coach Carter takes this to extremes.  Sit back and relax and enjoy this one.  If you don't watch this soon, you may regret it.  Now go find it in a theater somewhere.
B000008FS6|5.0|This edition SHOULD contain the nine minute long version of \\"Two Tribes\\" along with a track entitled \\"The Last Voice.\\" <br /> <br />However, when US production of this CD started, the CD booklet and even the silk screen printing on the disc remained the same, but the actual CONTENT of the disc was replaced by the US version of the album, which instead has a 3:27 version of \\"Two Tribes\\" and which replaces the song \\"Happy Hi\\" with \\"San Jose\\" as track 10. <br /> <br />There is literally NO WAY that I know of to tell if the disc is the correct one without putting the disc in a player and playing track 10 to see if it is \\"San Jose\\" or not. <br /> <br />I have purchased and have had to return more than one copy of this disc for this reason; sellers CANNOT TELL if their copy is the correct one solely by looking at the CD packaging and disc itself.
B000005ALN|5.0|First of all let me say, I tried to purchase this CD in the States but could not find it. What a shame. I finally ended up ordering though the UK.  About the CD. This is probably the finest piece of so-called Pop music available. However I do not consider this Pop at all, but a contempory tribute from a very gifted individual. George Michael has taken us on a trip, and allowed us to visit places in his head that he lives with everyday. I read somewhere that his fans want to know if he has a diary. if so, would he share it? As far as I am concerned, he doesn't need one because it's all in his music. It's all there, just listen.  From beginning to end he tells us stories. Powerful stories that have occurred in his life. His voice quality is superb. He doesn't try to scream out, or force it like so many artists do today. He carefully controls each note. I think control is a real issue for him. He controls everything. Within that control he lets us in. It's there. Just listen. Brilliant.
B00064WSN2|2.0|I have to agree with another reviewer that this is pretty much an attempt to put out a sequel to ITCotCK.  'Pictures of a City' has that same 'Heart of the Sunrise'-sounding guitar part just as Schizoid Man has.  The title track is just a copy of 'Epitaph'.  'Cadence and Cascade' is 'I Talk to the Wind'.   <br /> <br />One of the things that I love about Robert Fripp is his ability to change the style of music entirely, but still put out amazing music even up until the present day.  This album, on the other hand, deviates from the first album's sound very little.  The only two exceptions are 'Cat Food' which features Keith Tippett playing some Cecil Taylor style piano, and 'The Devil's Triangle' which is basically 'Mars' on LSD.   <br /> <br />Furthermore, I'd like to say that I think the only people who would give this album 5 stars are too infatuated with the first four Crimson albums.  There's so much better material out there like 'Red', 'Discipline', 'THRAK', and 'The Power to Believe' just to go through four other Crimson eras.  The music is much more experimental and progressive, and features musical prodogies such as Bill Bruford and Adrian Belew.   <br /> <br />I'd say the only good album from the early Crimson years other than ITCotCK is 'Islands'.  A word of advice...buy some more recent King Crimson before you grab 'In the Wake of Poseidon.'
B000002U82|5.0|\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is one of the best albums of all time.  From David Gilmour's brilliant melodic soloing, to the mesermizing soundscapes, this is truly a classic in every possible way.  Pink Floyd will forever be heralded for their greatness, and today's music scene would not be the same without them.
B000003N7K|5.0|I disagree with other reviewers who hail this as the greatest jazz album ever.  That is a bold statement, and an untrue one at that.  The most significant element in jazz is improvisation, and this album is lacking it, although it is still worthy of five stars. <br /> <br />Here we have the classic Coltrane quartet with Johnny Hartman on vocals.  It is by far the most romantic album I own, and it's a shame there are only six tracks.  I'm glad Trane chose Hartman for this recording - I find that the addition of a crooner like Hartman does wonders for the feeling put into these tunes.  His voclas are soft and sad at times, but extremely relaxing as well. <br /> <br />My favorite track is 'My One and Only Love' - countless musicians have performed this song including Sting, Ella, and Satchmo, however, this version stands out.  The first half of the song is just Coltrane and his bandmates playing the melody, and then around half way through, Hartman enters.  They complement each other in amazing ways, and it's too bad this is their only work together.  Another highpoint is the Billy Strayhorn classic, 'Lush Life'.  McCoy Tyner really stands out on this piece - his playing is reminiscent of a nice spring breeze.  Other highlights are 'You Are Too Beautiful' and the upbeat 'Autumn Serenade'.   <br /> <br />Like I said - it's not the greatest jazz album, but still belongs in any jazz collection.  Even if you end up hating it, it should prove to be useful the next time you are with your wife or girlfriend.  They will love it if you don't!
0670033693|5.0|Craig Johnson is a powerful new Wyoming writer.  We seem to be blessed with them lately!  I seldom buy debut books in hardcover but this one was given the highest praise by a respected friend, so I took the risk.  What a treat.<br /><br />Johnson describes the Wyoming terrain in crisp yet poetic language that takes you completely into Walt Longmire's world and makes you feel at home there.  The plot is complicated and ticks along as sweetly as a watch.  No irritating threads are left loose, and nothing extra is padded in to annoy my logical mind.<br /><br />His Native American characters aren't stereotypical suffering noble savages or burned out derelicts, but instead are complete, endearing, and complex individuals.  His female characters are strong and engaging and finally, of course, there's Sheriff Walt.<br /><br />Walt Longmire is a character so witty in the midst of disaster, stress, and bleak despair that I found myself laughing out loud while reading this book.  Henry Standing Bear, Omar, and the tough and lovely Vic have come to live in my heart.  I can't wait to rejoin their world.
B00000IP2L|1.0|If you like Zakk Wylde's work with Ozzy, then don't spend your money on this garbage for it will forever tarnish the image of the guitarist for you.  This is just ultra-sloppy, unoriginal metal.  Guitar solos are pretty much absent, and most of the songs sound the same.  I'm pretty sure Mr. Wylde was actually drinking black label when he wrote and recorded this.  He put out *3* solid albums with Ozzy, and unfortunately, that will be the high point of his career.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The title says it all. I'm not a fan of Sci-Fi or Westerns, and I've never heard of 'Joss Whedon' prior to watching Firefly. I am completely enthralled with this TV series, to the point of obsession. I cannot get enough of it, and it is such a loss to mankind that this show got cancelled.
B00079FUI6|1.0|These women Desperate Housewives give real life women a bad name and also a bad influnce on them. Shows like this is the reason why women don't respect men right now. It's such a sad world that women do nothing but stab men in the back and not show remorse for it. As far as this show goes the only time I see brief nudity is when one fo the wives was locked out side of her house naked and the other wife who is latin was in the bath tumb with a teenage boy. I figure since this show is on abc which is not cable they are trying to tone down the sexuality so they won't get find by the FCC.
B000022TSY|4.0|Believe it or not I was lucky enough to study this one at uni along with Thelma and Louise and Shane.  I lapped up every minute of Easy Rider, of course there is very little plot, but that is not the reason you watch it.  The stylised late sixties 'acid induced' camera work, fabulous sound track and wonderful male leads is a testament that even when people are doped to the eye balls some stories are begging to be told.  This film was so of its time - almost like the foretelling of the autumn and winter of the 'Summer of Love' when the warm fluffy ideaologies where crumbling and decaying and the establishment where again ascertaining their will.     <br />Dennis Hopper is so wonderful in this he holds the screen.  His maniac/OCD behaviour is a foretaste of many of the great characters he portrayed in the 70's, but also a stern reminder of his own personal descent, that thankfully now he has overcome.  Of course like many films of this time and even now the females are just window dressing.  It does frustrate me a bit because I like many of my contemporaries imagine myself on a big Harley cruising through the landscape, any way 'the times they are a changing' and some day I hope we will see more strong, sassy and beautiful women on the screen.
0553212478|4.0|... you create it, you name it, or else.<br /><br /> Shelley's Frankenstein is impressively written. Frankenstein is just so much more than a tale of a madman's obsession with his ambition and his creation of a monster. This novel encompasses human life and philosophy. Not only is this a story containing all elements of literature, it holds hidden meanings and truths that apply to life. An excellent job is done in tying the novel into other matters beyond the actual storyline. The message is relatable and interpretable, which makes for good discussion and meditation. This novel is a beautiful example of popular and debatable questions being aroused in the form of simple literature. The overall theme was clearly brought out through the text. This book has a purpose. While reading, one is taught that all actions have consequences. If you step out of bounds, you will pay. Frankenstein is truly a classic. If you have not read it, you are missing out.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|This is a great album. It proves that Robert Plant is one of very few Rockers that continue to innovate and sound as fresh after so many years.... Plant just seems to get better as a solo artist.  <br /> <br />The richness of the songs are fantastic. The lyrics of the songs are poetry. Another Tribe is a fantastic track.  <br />
6305433909|5.0|I've seen this movie and am glad to have a copy. Sister Act 2: BAck in the Habit can't and it will never be compared to the original one but the sequel has a distinct  uniqueness and individual artistry to follow up for. Sister Mary Clarence, a music teacher is back again to teach young and talented kids at St. Francis School in San Francisco. The sisters need her help and they're running out of ideas on how to stop the school from closing down. Finally, with a lot of PATIENCE, help and lots of encouragements the students proved to everybody by joining the competition that they're not just bunch of kids but they can do GOOD things through MUSIC and TEAMWORK. My favorite part of the movie when they started performing \\"Joyful,Joyful\\" with Lauryn Hill doing the intro I was blewn away.
B0007TKNII|3.0|First, let me qualify that I am not simply a fanatic of the stage show, or an ALW \\"purist\\".  I've only seen the stage production once, actually, but have grown up listening to the music on CD.  Yes, the Sarah Brightman / Michael Crawford music; more on that later. <br /> <br />Also, I'd like to preface this review by saying that if you hate the stage show of Phantom, you're not going to find anything redeeming in the movie, go ahead and move on.  From this point on, I won't address whether \\"Phantom\\" as a whole is \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", or who stole what from whom; but only what I though of the movie as an interpretation of ALW's musical. <br /> <br />On that theme, it might as well be mentioned right away that there are changes.  These changes affect both the timing of the story, as well as majorly altering the character of the Phantom.  I'd like to avoid spoiling any of these, so rather than outlining them I'll simply give my overall impression of them: while it's \\"different\\", I don't think I could call it better or worse.  Compared to the stage phantom, the movie phantom is more youthful, more human, less magical/\\"omniscient\\", and lacks the wicked (but very amusing) sense of humor of the stage play, as pointed out by another reviewer.  None of the other characters, however, are seriously altered. As mentioned above, some events are altered, but the changes make sense for adapting a play to fit the flow of a movie, even if some purists may be bothered by them. <br /> <br />Visually, the movie is spactacular, (spectacular) with more than a hint of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" feeling to it, especially at the opening and closing of the movie.  A few scenes are over the top, but this fits the nature of the musical, so if it's already something you enjoy it won't bother you a bit and it's quite nice to see what can be done in a movie vs. on a stage. <br /> <br />The orchestration is wonderful, for the most part.  It takes full advantage of what can be done via movie scoring, while still firmly maintaining Phantom's character as a stage-born musical.  Characters do not simply launch into song for no apparent reason, and if you know the story already everything is in there and fits into place. <br /> <br />So then, why the middling rating?  The inescapable fact is that 2 of the 3 leads are simply not up singing their parts.  It is not fair to simply \\"bash and run\\", so I will describe the problems that cause me to reach this conclusion.  Emmy Rossum certainly looks the part of Christine, but that's about all I can say I like about her for the part.  She is able to sing on-key (mostly), but much more than that is required to pull off a lead like Christine.  She does not seem to project from her diaphragm, and the result is that her voice comes out shallow and somewhat nasal, with almost no dynamic range.  The more disturbing flaw, however, is a lack of enunciation; words that should be crisp and clear flow together and lose definition within the music.  Combined with her shallow voice, the effect was most unsettling and unsatisfactory to me.  Perhaps it can be considered a stylistic opinion, but my fiance groaned through all of her songs as well, so I am not alone in my assesment. <br /> <br />Gerard Butler portrays the emotion of the Phantom quite well, so from an acting standpoint his casting is not bad at all.  His singing is simply dismal, however.  It's not that he has a bad voice, per se; but his lack of training is glaring.  He struggles to hit notes, consistantly coming up flat; notes that should be held and soar are merely loud and trail off to a gravely croak, as he lacks sustaining power.  When in his \\"angry\\" moments the words are spit out more than sung.  As some of my favorite points in the play are the Phantom's musical \\"rants\\" I found this performance especially disappointing. <br /> <br />These issues are only made more striking by the fact that Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman have so brilliantly defined their respective roles of The Phantom and Christine Daae.  Perhaps by even making the comparison this will be disregarded as mere enthusiasm for Crawford/Brightman, but I don't see how the camparison can not be made given the history of these parts. <br /> <br />Which brings me to the question: why not dub?  Though it seems to have fallen out of favor recently, some of the best movie musicals of all time have the singing parts extensively dubbed; indeed, Carlotta's singing in this very movie is dubbed.  Aside from bruising the actors' egos, I see no good reason that dubbing couldn't have been used to good effect for the Phantom and (maybe) Christine. <br /> <br />Patrick Wilson, on the other hand, does a fine job as Raoul.  As the only lead with Broadway experience, this does not come as a huge surprise. <br /> <br />As it stands, this movie is a visually stunning, solid version of ALW's production.  It is ideal for those who have not had an opportunity to see a major stage production of Phantom.  It is not, however, the stunning musical performance it could have been (and many fans are used to), and that's a real shame.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Robert Plant has found the secret to maintaining vigor in his solo career...he keeps his collaborations fresh by moving on.   With the exception of the disappointing \\"Walking Into Clarksdale\\" his solo career has been consistantly interesting and artistically satisfying, IMHO.    On this album, The Strange Sensation, as his current band is known, provides a sympathetic backing to Plant's muse, as they did on the enchanting \\"Dreamland.\\"     At this point, he's not gonna sell to anybody but his fans...if you're one of 'em, like me, you'll really like this CD.     I initially posted a review the day the CD was released and gave it 4 stares...now, after another dozen listens, the depth and substance of this effort is revealing itself.    An outstanding effort...maybe the best album he's been involved with since Physical Graffiti...5 STARS.    (Note to \\"zep fan\\" - I hate to break this to you, but I also saw Zep in '77, and Jimmy Page was a fried heroin junkie whose greatness was behind him...\\"Achilles' Last Stand\\" was his last stand, too...)

B0007Z4S4C|5.0|This is the first cd in a while that really blew me away on the first listen.  I was lucky enough to see Plant at SXSW, and that performance was incredible. Age isn't a factor with this man--All I have to say is \\"tin pan valley.\\"

B00005K9QP|5.0|Eric Clapton, all of 21 at the time this album was recorded, was at the peak of his powers in terms of taste, phrasing, restraint, concentration, focus, and explosiveness. The aimless noodling and repetitiveness that crept into his playing (Layla album excepted) due to the excesses of the Cream, drugs, and booze, was not existent here, nor on the rare \\"Primal Solos\\" LP (under John Mayall's name, now sadly out of print, I'm sure).    Since the blues are an improvisational genre, the best players are able to say something with each solo. Clapton achieved this with the work he did on this album; ironically and sadly never again did he approach this razor sharpness. Only Jimmie Vaughan with his work as a Fabulous Thunderbird has accomplished the same feat, namely \\"storytelling\\" with each solo.    I must share (especially with those who have a enjoyed a regular copy of this album in stereo) a discovery that might excite you.     Go to www.amazon.de, the German version of this American site, and order a copy of the Deram European version, which offers both remastered stereo AND MONO versions of the songs. Not only is the stereo version better than I ever remember hearing (even though I am a vinyl aficionado), the revelation here is the mono version. Awesome! The record sounds much more like an ensemble piece, and John Mcvie's bass and Mayall's vocals are much better heard in the mono mix, meaning that the bass is more present, warm, and encompassing, while the vocal is less out front.    In short, if you are a neophyte blues lover, you need this album, and this version of it, as a starter. If you have owned this album on vinyl and CD in only the stereo version, you really need this CD to experience this album with practically the same intensity as when you first heard it.    I will grant that Clapton, in a strange way like Bob Dylan, has always had a mystery and elusiveness about him-- a certain undeniable charisma, but here on this album you'll understand what all the hype was about, and how a legend was born.    Is it worth the extra money? (shipping from Germany is expensive)    YES.    I know what I am talking about, friends.
B000002UA9|3.0|To truly appreciate the Beatles for who they are in the canon of music history, you have to consider that prior to this album singers and songwriters were very rarely the same people. Accomplished singing legends like Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley almost never wrote the tunes they sang. It was NOT a badge of irrelevance to be \\"just\\" an interpreter of song. For better or worse, that all changed shortly after the Fabs burst onto the scene.<br /><br />From this first album, you only see the seeds of the shift: 8 of the 14 tracks here are \\"Lennon/McCartney\\" and several of them are fairly unremarkable tunes that don't really hint at what either John or Paul would become (to say nothing of George).<br /><br />That said, the opening track does make it plain that history is about to change. That \\"1,2,3,fah!\\" that bursts out of the speakers is nothing short of incendiary..notice to the old guard that there's a new sheriff in town.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />\\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" has proven durable enough to survive a trampling by 80s teen popper Tiffany and an 80s rewrite (albeit a good one) by 80s rocker Joan Jett (that's really all \\"I Love Rock and Roll\\" is..). It still resonates more than 40 years later. Other standouts are the title tune with its building harmonies on the \\"C'mon...\\" bridge, the almost bossa nova shuffle of \\"P.S. I Love You\\" (the idea of trading lead vocals between the group in unison and Paul was also a relatively new idea at the time), and the decent \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret?\\". If those aren't enough, they manage to place another all-time rock classic into the debut with John's tonsil-shredding cover of \\"Twist and Shout\\" that accomplishes the rare distinction of superseding the original (sorry, Isley Brothers fans..)<br /><br />LOWS:<br />It's obvious that the Fabs owed a big debt to 60s girls groups (\\"Chains\\") and R&B(\\"Anna\\",\\"Boys\\",\\"Baby it's You\\") but their versions reveal themselves as pallid garage band knockoffs of the \\"real thing\\". Show tune \\"A Taste of Honey\\" is also an ill fit for the group.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />If you somehow have no idea who the Beatles are, don't start here to understand them. This is really only necessary to complete a collection, or to understand their beginnings. If you're looking for \\"suit era\\" Beatles music, the better stuff was still to come.<br /><br />3 1/2 starsney\\" is also an ill fit for the group.    BOTTOM LINE:   If you somehow have no idea who the Beatles are, don't start here to understand them. This is really only necessary to complete a collection, or to understand their beginnings. If you're looking for \\"suit era\\" Beatles music, the better stuff was still to come.    3 1/2 stars
B00005JLXE|5.0|Take a look at the DIRECTOR'S CUT! It's a much better film than the edited theatrical cut. Too bad they didn't release this version on the big screen. It seems they've pulled the same trick on Elektra and put out a mangled version instead of the R rated Director's Cut. It's no wonder these films get such mixed reviews. I'd like to see the R rated version of Elektra one of these days. The Director's Cut of Daredevil is the way to go. It's an excellent film.
B000002UYZ|3.0|Yes, this is the lineup that was on it when the album was first released but since it's a 'greatest hits' album...not a proper album...there's no reason not to upgrade it to the modern era.(Maintaining continuity doesn't matter when it was never CONCEIVED as a group of songs anyway.)<br /><br />CD capacity is 80 minutes, so Capitol/EMI could EASILY have  combined the tracks onto one disc and then lowered the price accordingly about $10 bucks. If they wanted to keep it as a 2 CD set of \\"early years\\" material, they should have added a LOT of extra music for your $30.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />It's hard to quibble with what's on here as a representation of early Beatles music (save \\"Girl\\" from \\"Rubber Soul\\" which is one of the least interesting album tracks there..swapping it with \\"You Won't See Me\\" would have been a better call) but EMI should have seized the capabilities of the CD to make one really good disc...or expanded the offerings on both to come closer to at LEAST 45 minutes per disc. What's here is shameful on a strictly \\"music for the money\\" basis. If you have to get this, get it used, but you're probably better off with the \\"1s\\" disc if you're just a casual fan.<br /><br />5 star music but docked 2 stars for the consumer gouging= 3 stars
B00063MBU8|1.0|Simple Plan is precisely what's wrong with music today.  This industry created stuff sounds like the male version of Avril Lavigne for chrissakes!  No substance whatsoever.  Just whiney, angst-ridden garbage for pimply white-trash adolescents who have absolutely NO clue as to what good rock is.  If you want REAL punk rock, go listen to your parents albums and CD's from the late 70's and early 80's.  That was when punk had real cojones and attitude!  Nuff said.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Wonderful sound, wonderful images. Butler's deep voice is perfectly sexy, and Rossum's voice is ever prettier than Brightman's & a lot smoother. Wilson's lyric tenor is great. This movie is a work of art. This movie is scortching in it's sexuality. Gerard Butler is aabsolutely mesmerizing as the phantom. But,see it for yourself as rental, and decide by your own responses.
B000002U82|5.0|Normally, when I write a review for an album, I struggle to make the review as long, conscise and interesting as I can. But in the case of \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", everything has been said. So I am going to make it short and sweet: buy this album. If you don't you are depriving yourself of one of if not the greatest albums ever made, including true rock classics like \\"Us & Them\\" and \\"Money\\". So I repeat: buy it.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|I knew some of the music and the history (ALW stole practically everything from various Puccini operas) when I went to see this movie. Schumacker said that he did not want to focus on the glamour and the grandiose and instead make sure to capture the love story. He failed miserably. The movie is nothing but glitz and bad music. <br /> <br />First of all, the love story is conspicuously absent from the musical... it does not happen at any point that I noticed, though it is often spoken of. The images in this movie adaptation were certainly stunning, but made little dramatic sense. The music in no way enhanced the plot or characters. It looked like Sir Andrew and Schumacker just wanted to show off how much money they have. <br /> <br />It was a truly awful movie adaptation of a truly awful musical. If you want the romance of the Phantom story, go for Maury Yeston's version. That one has its heart where it belongs, not in its wallet.
0312263120|1.0|Characters are not credible. <br /> <br />No evidence of serious research. <br /> <br />Plot is much too far-fetched. The action scenes become more and <br />more ridiculous as the book goes on.
B000002U82|5.0|This album comes with the highest of recommendations.  It has simply taken the world by storm.  Not since the Beatles have a band had quite this big of am impact on the music scene.  It is 43 minutes of pure bliss.  If you enjoy great cinema like \\"The Godfather\\", and want to experience that feeling in music, then \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is indeed for you.
B000002LK1|5.0|When DM released Violator, the band reached the apex of music. There was no lyrical plane higher than this CD, joining the ranks of The White Album, Let It Bleed, The Wall, Thriller, Zeppelin IV, Back in Black, Joshua Tree, and Rumours as one of the greatest in musical history. I cherish every chord of Violator - Enjoy the Silence, Policy of Truth and Waiting for the Night never get old, never stale. I agree with the reviewer that this collection of songs would help world peace. It brings listeners to a very personal, very private, very spiritual place.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd are like Salvador Dali in a red convertible driving way too fast through San Fransicso.  And that's a very good thing.  Pink Floyd's music is good enough to give the healthiest man a heart attack. They're good enough to make tacos look like horse manure.  They're good enough to make the late Lorne Greene jump up out of his grave and go \\"Yee Hah!\\". <br /> <br />Just buy it.  You will see.
B00005A1PR|5.0|One thing I like about India Arie, which is why I know she's not made it mainstream is that she writes positive lyrics. She isn't talking about screwing this and that and all that mess. Her lyrics are uplifting and she is a very talented human being. I hope she releases something in the future. LOVE YA INDIA!
B00000DGUG|5.0|I wouldn't go so far to call this album the best ever, but it's definitively unique. It looks obvious that Alanis wrote 17 very introspective songs, but what's amazing to me it's their way to match (at least in a considerable percentage)experiences and emotions that almost every 30 years old human been have had in his life. With this album Alanis shows to the world her great personality. <br />If you like the sound of this album (by the way, some of the tracks are very, very original and even sperimental) you wouldn't stop singing its songs everytime you listen to it. It's a prefect album for enjoying everyday experiences and for get yourself emotioned while singing and screaming from the top of your lungs. <br />
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd can kick your butt to Pizza Hut, and back again.  They rule all that is tangible in the known universe.  And all the other stuff too.  \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" is filet mignon for your ears, and don't forget the frickin A1. <br /> <br />Like the Kool Aid Man says, OH YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000929AJQ|2.0|Nine Inch Nails (NIN) is one of my top favorite bands of all time. The first three songs I heard from them back in 1996 when I started listening to music was \\"Head Like a Hole,\\" \\"Terrible Lie,\\" and \\"Closer.\\" Those are what got me into NIN, and I loved both CDs those songs came from, \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral.\\" \\"Downward Spiral\\" also had other outstanding tracks, \\"March of the Pigs,\\" \\"Ruiner,\\" and \\"Heresy.\\"  <br /> <br />Then in 2000, Trent Reznor had a double disc album titled \\"The Fragile,\\" which was a phenomenal release. \\"The Fragile\\" contained some of NIN's greatest songs, such as the hard and fast music in \\"Starf***ers, Inc.,\\" and \\"Somewhat Damaged,\\" to the instrumental \\"Pilgrimage,\\" through \\"I'm Looking Forward To Joining You, Finally,\\" which sounds like something out of a Native American rain dance.  <br /> <br />After that, Trent seemed to go back into remixville without making anything really new.  <br /> <br />\\"With Teeth\\" is the first NIN album in six years, which I, along with every other NIN fan, had been waiting for. Unfortunately, \\"With Teeth\\" is a major disappointment to both the fans and to Trent as I want to know what he was doing during these past six years.  <br /> <br />First off, a lot of the songs sound like Trent was just bored when he was singing them, which is highly noticeable in \\"Only\\" and \\"All the Love in the World.\\" \\"All the Love in the World\\" has some potential to it, but the song takes about 3-4 minutes to do so, and then it seems to end abruptly.  <br /> <br />\\"The Hand that Feeds,\\" is the first single, and took me about ten hearings before I started to like it, but it is still not the greatest song in the world. Even worse though, it ends up being one of the harder sounding tunes on the entire album. Whether or not that is a good thing has to be determined by the individual listening to this CD, but for me, it is a major let down as Trent can do better than this.  <br /> <br />The entire album is not a total loss, as \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same, \\"Sunspots,\\" \\"You Know What You Are,\\" and \\"With Teeth\\" are decent songs, but could be much better. \\"With Teeth\\" does bring back memories of \\"The Fragile's\\" \\"I'm Looking Forward To Joining You, Finally\\" though, so that was enjoyable.  <br /> <br />As if things were not bad enough on this album, the last three songs are almost unbearable to listen to. \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" is just a dreadful song that has no redeeming quality in it, while \\"Beside You in Time\\" has just as much potential as the ones I mentioned above, but goes by without reaching it. \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" is filled with piano playing most of the song, but there is just something about it that makes it an unpleasant experience.  <br /> <br />Finally, the remaining tracks I have yet to mention (\\"The Collector,\\" \\"Love is Not Enough,\\" and \\"Getting Smaller\\"), are so disappointing to the point that the song is forgettable the moment it ends. It feels as if there was no song at all.  <br /> <br />As mentioned before, for being the first real NIN album in six years, it was a real disappointment. It just feels like Trent needed to get a new CD out to please the fans with new material regardless of how trashy they were.  <br /> <br />Also, as if disappointment with the music was not enough, the cover art is bland because there is nothing exciting shown, and there is no booklet with lyrics in it.  <br /> <br />One last item since I own the Dual Disc version. The newspapers in my area made it sound like it was a CD that came with a DVD that contained all of NIN's music videos sans Marilyn Manson's and Korn's \\"Best of\\" albums. Instead, it is just a double sided disc with one side featuring the music, while the other side, a DVD, contains the same bland music and the video to \\"The Hand that Feeds.\\"  <br /> <br />Trent, if you happen to read this (doubtful), I hope your next album has more passion put into it than this one.  <br /> <br />I give it 2/5 stars, and that is justbecause it is NIN. <br />
B000002LEM|4.0|I think this is really the last good Van Halen album.  There's one crappy track, the awful A Apolitical Blues (what a surprise to learn that Van Halen is 'apolitical') but aside from that this album balances real rockers with slower, dreamier (and indeed cheesier Van songs) though nothing is particularly offensive.<br /><br />Van Halen basically made the same album over and over, using the same producer (Ted Templeton) who mastered the sound of the band.  The instruments sound the same on every album, with only a little flourish here and there of extra production (keyboards, sequencers).  But it was always the classic Van Halen guitar and the fat, top-heavy drums.  The vocals required a guy who could party and scream a lot but not get too serious, because that would betray the unmistakable party feeling of the band.  And this is probably Haggar's finest hour with Van Halen.  Growing into the role of professional party-man-singer, Sammy screams about more of the same, one of the few singers (along with Roth, of course) to use \\"Yeah!\\" or \\"Oooooooooooooh!\\" as an entire verse.  The man's libido is dripping off the CD, as he discusses his intention to perform intimate acts until injury (Black and Blue), for instance.  The band keeps a real jewel for last.  'Sucker in a 3-Piece' is nothing short of a masterpiece.  From the opening guitar riff, to the drum buildup, to the loud scream that marks Sammy's entrance on the track, it has it all.  You can't deny a song with the line 'He got a big 'ol belly...stone-bald head', referring to the titular 'sucker' in a 3-piece suit, no doubt a serious affront to Sammy.<br /><br />Van Halen was a good one-trick pony, providing brainless, loud guitar rock with fat hooks.  I think after this outing it started to get a little embarassing as the health problems of Eddie combined with the rotating singer (it never really mattered, as they all screamed the same inane lyrics) caused the band to slip off the charts and into AA.  But OU812 (real brilliant title there) is a very good outing.<br /><br />What's up with no remastered version of this album?  They remastered all of them up to 5150, what about the rest?  The album needs it.  The remastering brings everything out, widening that flat, middle-range sound of most AAD discs.  I wanna hear those fat, sloppy high-hats better, and Eddie's big, fat guitar riffs.e there) is a very good outing.      What's up with no remastered version of this album?

B00006FR47|5.0|These guys are quality musicians and they like to merge  jazz, rock and pop to create their own sound. They have penned hard rock classics like \\"I'm a man\\" and \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" but also produced  beautiful romantic ballads like \\"If you leave me now\\".   <br /> Unfortunately, there is a stark contrast  between their  more improvised jazz  compositions and the chart oriented love songs they produce. I believe that \\"Chicago 5\\" is the only album they released which actually manages to create a compatable mix.
B0007YMUZW|3.0|I was struck by how much Grateful Dead-sounding guitar can be heard on \\"Cold Roses\\" (especially on disc 2).  I know that Ryan Adams is a huge (unapologetically) Dead fan, but, regardless of how good it sounds, it was almost overdone.  I like Mr. Adams a lot and consider myself a pretty big fan, but he seems to be doing some mimicking (of artists he loves) lately.  With \\"Rock N Roll\\" sounding very much like The Replacements and The Smiths, I'm wondering where his identity has gone. <br /> <br />Regardless, \\"Cold Roses\\" is a nice cd to listen to.  Mr. Adams has  great voice and seems to have recovered from his wrist injury as gracefully as he is able.  I'll continue to buy everything he releases, knowing that it will be solid and enjoyable.
B0006M4SO6|1.0|This sounds like the soundtrack to an 80's b-movie. Please don't blame the fans if the guy is trying to cater to all the crossover rock-fusion people (for money). Where is the JAZZ?!Maybe he should call up Bowie (or spinal Tap)for his next one.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|That's not a bad thing. Whiskeytown is a very likeable Alt Country band. But after listening to this I really wanted more of the edgy Ryan Adams. Like the Love is Hell album. A lot of these songs are pretty sugary sweet, staypuff marshmallowee after Love is Hell. <br /> <br />I keep waiting for Tears for Fears to break out in the chorus of \\"Blossom\\". I'm guessing he is in love again, which can only mean another great angst ridden album to follow!
B00005AFMT|1.0|I always hear this thing about the great musicianship of all these progressive rock/Jazz fusion bands and it all sounds like decadent self-indulgent garbage. Strange time signatures, eastern riffs ... ooh, ahh ... big deal. This doesn't move me, this stuff is for those who play too much D&D. P.S. This is what PMG has become.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|let me put a disclaimer out there first: i am a big ryan adams fan. that said, i don't think anyone could be disappointed by this album. it is a wonderfully timed release; an album to put in on a beautiful day and simply enjoy life for all its wonder. from a music standpoint, ryan adams' songwriting combined with the amazing talents of jp bowersock, catherine popper, cindy cashdollar and brad pemberton make for one of mr. adams' best releases, and that's saying an awful lot. i would try and put somewhat of a term on it; folky, twangy, \\"alt-rock\\"... but the fact of the matter is its all these and none of these. in an age of music where things are repeated until cliche, this album in a beautiful breath of fresh air. enjoy it. (and pre-order his next one due out in august as soon as you can. if this album is great, that might be transcendent.)
B00023GGFI|5.0|I originally bought this LP 36 years ago. It is still my favorite album of all time. This new release just reinforces my opinion!

B000679N96|4.0|Though I've been a casual fan for ten years, I recently became a die-hard after purchasing the Trilogy DVD, and when I learned about the remastered editions, I decided that now would be a good time to collect their full library of work from the beginning, as it was re-released. <br /> <br />This is the first time I heard Three Imaginary Boys in its original form, having previously learned these tracks from the U.S. version, Boys Don't Cry. The original arrangement is better, and it is clear that The Cure suffered the same problems early on in their career that haunted The Beatles throughout theirs, having their albums cut and edited to notions of marketability. <br /> <br />That aside, their first album may sound rough compared to their heavily layered Disintegration or highly emotional Pornography, but it's a fun and enjoyable album that still hints at their intellectual depth. Fans of The Police's early works  would probably enjoy it. <br /> <br />Most of the bonus tracks are more of interest to dedicated fans rather than casual listeners, much like the bonus material on DVDs that show the development of a movie from story boards to finished product, but the singles forced onto the U.S. album release have been supplied, with the noticable exception of the once notorious \\"Killing An Arab,\\" a track that in this post 9/11 era is disturbingly more applicable than ever, either incorrectly seen as a hate song or correctly interpreted as a protest.
6305776326|4.0|I'm not usually a fan of the comedy genre -- especially the Hollywood variety. Yet for some reason, I love this movie, and have seen it three times in the week I've rented it. Molly Shannon is absolutely brilliant, and her performance is genuinely funny and at times, touching. Even though this movie does rely on Hollywood conventions (like mawkish, one-dimensional romance) and is silly beyond its own goal (that ridiculous God spectacle that \\"guides\\" Mary), it redeems itself through the hilarious tree-smooching scenes, which are priceless, as well as many others. I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants to chill out and have a laugh -- even if you think Hollywood comedy isn't for you. This is a keeper.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I enjoyed with the first season, and therefore I bought me the first season in DVD.  Now, I am happy to see that the second season will be for sale in DVD.<br /><br />The extras seem to be well.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Yes it's true what you've heard...the \\"voice\\" has returned.  I found Mariah's whispered hushed toned voice that she has used for the past couple of years to be downright grating, and I'm glad that she has gone back to really using her voice.  But, that is not the only thing that's good about this album.  There are songs with some pretty strong melodies all throughout.  This is one of the best \\"conventional\\" R&B albums that I have heard in a while.  The material is pretty much standard fare for top 40, and there is no new ground forged here, but everything that Mariah does, she does really well on this album.  Even the rapper collaborations that she's done consistently on every album since \\"Butterfly\\", but that have rarely resulted in good songs, actually work on this album (especially her Twista collaboration, \\"One and Only\\").  Almost all of the slow to mid-tempo songs are great, and luckily, they dominate this release.  But, even the uptempo dance numbers are pretty good, with the exception of \\"Shake it Off\\" that is.  Much of \\"It's like that\\" didn't strike me as great either, but this song is totally redeemed by that gorgeous pre-chorus section.  That Jermaine Dupri intro to \\"Get your number\\" REALLY should have been left off, but this is a suprisingly good song otherwise.  The track listing only gives credit to Dupri but either Dupri does a great Nelly imitation or that's Nelly singing the hook on this track.  The highlights on this album are abundant but the songs that stand out most to me are \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Stay the Night\\", and \\"Circles\\".  I guess that this CD is supposed to be some sort of loose concept album about Mariah no longer feeling like she has to live up to other people's expectations.  I'm not quite buying it but, whatever! :-).  It's still a solid album nevertheless and it has left me looking forward to new releases by Mariah.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Why do so many of us (myself included) blame the artists when they come out with something WE don't like. The Way Up is a masterpiece. PMG (among others, of course) make the best music on the planet. It doesn't matter who likes it. Find the genius, power, and beauty in this music if you can. I did. Keep it up, Pat & Lyle!
B00005A1PR|4.0|This is a strong little album right here.  The fact that India has such a genuine love and appreciation for music and art is strikingly self-evident throughout the entire album.  India is truly talented, plus she has a special, beautiful spark about her that just makes her work that much more engaging.  The acoustic guitar dominates on this album and she makes wonderful use of it throughout, but there are also various other elements that she uses that are just as effective.  India is a truly impressive lyricist.  The messages can sometimes be a tad bit heavy-handed (\\"Strength, Courage and Wisdom\\", \\"I See God in You\\") but she is so full of genuine wisdom and insight, and she delivers them with such sincerity, genuine honesty, and ease, that more than anything else, they just come off as really warm and genuine.  And her lyrics are just as impressive in terms of style as they are in terms of substance.  I especially love the clever concept song about her inspired, joyful, special love for music, \\"Always in My Head\\", with its thoughtful metaphors and clever imagery.  You have to hear this song.  It is absolutely the greatest song about music, and what it truly means to people like myself and India, that I've ever heard.  This album is an impressive listen all throughout and comes to a wonderful ending with her very befitting Stevie Wonder tribute: soulful, upbeat and fit with Wonder-like warm melodic modulation.  The lyrics which link together Stevie Wonder album titles, song names, etc., are straightfoward, yet clever without being at all coy, and that's a large part of what makes the song so charming (and really, that's part of what makes this entire album so charming).  And, the pseudo-Stevie sounding backing track works perfectly.  This is a great album and it's the strongest debut I've heard so far this millennium.
B00005JMUL|5.0|Just wondering if anyone knows when this class film will be out on DVD?
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Horrible Keanu Reeves film that could be possibly his worse movie to date. Keanu should have never gotten this role and it only shows that the people who work in Hollywood are really stupid because the role calls for someone who can give a complicate performance, something Reeves can not pull off. He comes across as a phony and his performance is possibly his worse. The script does not help him at all with bad dialog that could crack the sound barrier and a story that makes no sense what so ever. Reeve's co star Rachel Weisz does more with her role than he does with his and steals the movie with a tight and strait forward performance that could have been a better lead for this movie than Keanu's character. I believed in her character's plight more than the believed in what was going on in the entire film and would have liked to know more about her as well.     Other than Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, who gives the last few minutes of the film a good scare, the movie is pretty bad.
B000002UAI|5.0|After the exuberant and triumphant film success \\"A HARD DAY'S NIGHT\\", the Fab Four continued to grow musically and (especially) lyrically as Lennon sported a maturing perspective (\\"No Reply\\", \\"I'm A Loser\\", \\"Baby's In Black\\", \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\\") that expounded upon the typically passe moon-and-June wordplay of popular music. McCartney's skill as a songwriter began to peak with impeccably crafted ballads (\\"I'll Follow The Sun\\") and ear-piercing rockers (\\"What You're Doing\\"). George contributes typically expert lead guitar while Ringo's love of country music comes to fore not only on the Carl Perkins cover \\"Honey Don't\\" but throughout this entire phase of The Beatles' career prior to the release of \\"REVOLVER\\" and their commencement as purely a studio band retired from the road. Although \\"BEATLES FOR SALE\\" can be hailed as another masterful Beatles record, there can be no denying that the Fab Four were physically and mentally worn-out (just look at the sleeve). Another sad fact is that this is the last of their LP's to feature a generous helping of their own glorious renditions of classic rock songs. And even though the Lennon/McCartney songbook would go on to transform the entire landscape of pop music, it is still a treat to hear them cover material like Carl Perkins' \\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby\\", Leiber and Stoller's \\"Kansas City\\" (which Wilbert Harrison took to Number 1 in 1959), Chuck Berry's \\"Rock And Roll Music\\", and Buddy Holly's \\"Words Of Love\\". The chart topping \\"Eight Days A Week\\" and the country-rock of \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\\" (a Number 39 hit) became the record's best known tracks, but all of it has aged remarkably well despite its rather somber and downbeat tone. HIGHEST POP ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 1.
B000002LCK|3.0|If this was a collection of the ORIGINAL or album versions of these songs, it would easily get 5 stars from me. In particular, \\"Perfect Kiss\\" and \\"Subculture\\" have been transformed into overly-disco-fied dancefloor pap - yuck!

But when I heard it, damn , they sound so much better with more umppph! &lt;&lt; a word used by an ex- telephone surveyor supervisor. <br /> I guess Umppph is a good thing on this album ... The album goes well with 3 beers. I got the CD with 6 tracks. You know... the budget MCA one, I need the full 14 songs or so to get the real buzz. Im collecting the 500 best albums of all time according to Rolling Stone magazine ( Dec.11, 2003). This album is # 170 on that list. You should check out that list, search>>>> rolling stone 500 albums, you may not agree, but this is by far the most comprehensive album list of all time, as time goes by I respect it more and more. I am collecting CDs from that list, I now have about 235 of the 500. Some of the albums that I never heard before really open my ears to new things, This album is a worthy album on that list.
B0001KU93C|4.0|AWESOME!! Yes, the sound track is bla and it is obviously a low budget movie - but inspite of that it is one of the best westerns I ever saw. The violence might have been hard in the 60's, but everybody who can cope watching the Sopranos will have no problems with this film. After we viewed this film, my husband's first comment was:\\" When  do you get another Django movie?\\". Great entertainment!
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Yes, this could have been a one disc album. But, why would you complain about this? Make your own mix album yourself. With Cold Roses, we get 18 songs from the wonderful innovative troubador of Ryan Adams. The more the merrier. For those familiar with Ryan's work, this record does resemble Heartbreaker/Love is Hell more than his other works. For those who are not familiar, it's folk-rock wonder. There are some real gems on this album that make it to the top of Ryan's already impressive catalogue. This catalogue looks to get deeper with two more albums this year alone. This man's at the top of his songwriting game, and I can't believe people aren't loving every minute of it. Let's take every bit of music he's willing to offer while we can.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Moronic and self indulgent Keanu Reeves vanity project lacks the heart and the wits of the comic book which it steals most of it's ideas form and ruins them with a horrible acting performance by Keanu Reeves, which looks more like he's reading from cue cards than remembering a script. The rest of the actors do better in their roles than he does with Rachel Weisz stealing the show with a deep and strong performance , Gavin Rossdale, doing a very convincing job as an agent of the underworld and Djmon Hounsou giving a bit role more class than he should have. Tilda Swinton does well with a small role that is very underwritten and Shia LaBeouf is well, Shia LaBeouf. Don't expect any more than that.  <br /> <br />Skip it, you will thank yourself after you see it when its on cable.  <br /> <br />
B00005N5S5|4.0|Director:  James Cameron. <br />Cast:  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn. <br />Rated R for violence, language, nudity, and sexual situations. <br />Running Time:  108 minutes. <br /> <br />Underrated and much more entertaining than many would lead you to believe, \\"The Terminator\\" is one of the most innovative science-fiction thrillers of all-time and is also the film that put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the Hollywood map.  The Governor of California stars as an android robot sent from the future to destroy an unsuspecting future mother (Linda Hamilton) of a child that will disrupt mankind's fight against technology in decades to come.  Michael Biehn (with a superb supporting performance) plays a time-traveling agent also sent back from the future, but his role is to make sure that Hamilton is contained safely until the terminating android is destroyed. <br /> <br />One of the earlier works from the great James Cameron (\\"Titanic\\", \\"Aliens\\"), this special effects spectacle is an entertaining roller-coaster ride full of thrills, macabre, and good ol' Schwarzenegger fun.  The film may unfortunately be known for some of the terminator's corny lines (\\"I'll be back.\\"), but it should be recognized for one of the best cinematic climaxes in science-fiction history.  Excellent cinematography, a solid musical score, and nice performances.  Outdone by its sequel, but special and important in its own right. <br />
0393026590|5.0|Richard Feynman (1918-1988) had a very full and adventurous life as can be gleaned from this great book. The first half is mostly autobiographical and anecdotal and in the typical Feynman way, he leaves nothing to the imagination. He spent the latter part of his life as a Professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, Ca.<br /><br />For hobbies he loved bongos and drums and occasionally performed with a drumming group at Caltech, but was content to spend hours drumming with close friends such as Ralph Leighton at his home. Feynman also enjoyed drawing and painting and some of his artwork is depicted in this book. The artwork was exacting and professional. There are several photos covering Feynman's life and concluding with space shuttle photos and diagrams.<br /><br />The second half of the book, and some would say the most potent part, is dedicated to Feynman's participation in the investigation of the 1986 space shuttle \\"Challenger\\" accident. Feynman demonstrated the ultimate in dogged pursuit of the cause and was not to be intimidated or put-off by NASA and military officials who would have been happy not disclose the damning facts that they were thoroughly warned about safety issues before the launch, yet chose to ignore these warnings in deference to then  Pres. Reagan's desire for a political feather in his cap by launching the shuttle on his schedule.<br /><br />Who knows what, if anything, was explained to Reagan that the weather was too cold to launch (the shuttle was not suppose to be launched in less than 53 degree weather and the temperature at launch time was 29 degrees!). What is known is that the NASA management chose to ignore the warnings and heeded the beck and call of the President to launch. Later, and like typical management weasels, they tried to hush-up the fact that they were warned and then tried to blame the \\"O\\"-ring failure on the manufacturer, Thiokol.<br /><br />During the inquiry, Feyman took the opportunity to demonstrate a simple, common-sense experiment in front of his fellow investigative teammates and news cameras that when the \\"O\\"-rings are chilled (he dropped a piece of one held by pliers in a glass of ice-water) they shrink and cannot seal properly, and especially when the violent vibration of the launch process is added for an ultimately disastrous mix.<br /><br />If not for Feynman's persistence, this simple, but profound demonstration could have been swept under the rug and fingers unfairly pointed at Thiokol. Management refused to take any responsibility for the disaster, yet when in fact, their incompetent dismissal of the freeze conditions were what led to the disaster. Thank God for Richard Feynman! This is not only a fascinating look into Feynman's life, it is a national treasure, for here is where we see the bungling, politically motivated decisions of a great country being jerked around by bureaucrats leading, ultimately, to disaster.ple, common-sense experiment in front of his fellow investigative teammates and news cameras that when the \\"O\\"-rings are chilled (he dropped a piece of one held by pliers in a glass of ice-water) they shrink and cannot seal properly, and especially when the violent vibration of the launch process is added for an ultimately disastrous mix.

B000929AJQ|4.0|Very enjoyable CD.  Every time I get to thinking about this album outside of when I'm listening to it, my thoughts are something like 'The songs don't flow into each other, they don't fit, there's good songwriting but I don't like the lyrics'.<br /><br />When I actually play the album, though, I realize I like pretty much all of the songs.  True, they may not all be original compared to the rest of NIN's catelogue, there is LESS originality, I wouldn't say none.  \\"Love Is Not Enough\\" and \\"You Know What You Are\\" might be very remiscient of old NIN, but then you have stuff like \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\", which, while staying true to Trent's unique harmonic style, creates a melody I sincerely haven't heard from NIN.  \\"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\\" (one of the best I think) doesn't remind me of NIN at all, but uses the same style of melody as an Incubus song called \\"11AM\\" from Morning View.  This is interesting since the \\"Every Day\\" is a keyboard/beat driven song whereas \\"11AM\\" is an acoustic ballad.<br /><br />This album IS more poppy then The Fragile, I KNEW that would be the case, because Trent basically said so.  But that's ok.  There are poppy songs on the Fragile, and not ALL of this is poppy.  I have gradually grown to enjoy songs like the somewhat haphazard \\"Only\\" and \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" because they are good in their context.<br /><br />I have edited this review to say that I now very much appreciate the lyrics of this album.  They reflect a very significant sense of boredom and lost meaning and purpose in life.  Having felt this way myself a number of times Trent does a great job expressing it.  Trent has also NOT said this before in any of his music.<br /><br />The closer \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" I don't understand the obsession with.  Uninteresting chord progressions, pseudo-intellectual lyrics.  Great song, but none-the-less has none of the intensity it would need to actually surpass a song like \\"Hurt\\".<br /><br />The production is very good but there are much less sounds in general.  Not produced quite as well as the new Downward Spiral or the Fragile.<br /><br />I was never an NIN die hard, being a die hard of any band doesnt make sense to me.  There is too much good music out there.  For those who thank Trent for 'bringing back real music', open your eyes.  There's a lot out there.  Having said this \\"The Fragile\\" and \\"Downward Spiral\\" are still 2 of my favorite albums.  Overall this is exactly what I expected from him, due to what he said.  The idea seems to be that each song is less of a masterpiece unto itself and that the album in general is still great.  Buy it if you have TDS, Fragile and Broken.<br /><br />I am editing this review to now say that I would change my rating to 5 stars.  I enjoy this album like hell, and I almost always feel like putting it on.oduced quite as well as the new Downward Spiral or the Fragile.

B0007YMUZW|4.0|In my opinion, \\"Gold\\" was the standard by which all other albums should be judged.  It was what I consider to be one of the best albums EVER.  Cold Roses is good, and better than all of his recent albums, but just not up to the Gold standard.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Any long-term PT fan has come to expect these album-to-album departures.  And that is what we love about this band so much.  While there are a ton of poor prog bands, it is this distinct characteristic that makes being a PT fan a wonderful and truly progressive musical experience.    In Absentia caught the attention of a lot of new PT fans.  And subsequently, more people came to expect PT to just roll over and repeat that which they have done before.  But if you are just getting into this band and expect one album to be what the last was...well, find another band, because this band has proven over the decade plus that I have followed them, that history seldom repeats itself.  Thus, is the case of PT.    Deadwing is an exceptional work.  They build on a solid musical past and add new and expanded dimensions to it all to make a completely \\"unlike anything PT has done before\\" album.  Bravo guys!  Great Work!
B000067FP8|5.0|Director:  Joe Dante. <br />Cast:  Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, John Glover, Robert Prosky, Robert Picardo, Christopher Lee, Dick Miller, Jackie Joseph. <br />Rated PG-13 for cartoonish monster violence and language. <br />Running Time:  107 minutes. <br /> <br />Perhaps one of the most perfect blends of horror and comedy, this sequel to the 1984 cult hit is arguably even better than original.  Those crazy flesh-eating marsupials branch out from just tormenting small towns and promote themselves to the big-time--New York City.  Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates return to take on the fiendish ghouls as they invade and terrorize the futuristic New York City high-rise that Billy Peltzer (Galligan) works. <br /> <br />Joe Dante, director of the original \\"Gremlins\\", as well as other horror-comedy romps such as \\"Piranha\\" and \\"The Howling\\", does a stupendous job using the gremlins as not only horrific threats to the main characters, but exploits them for social satire and surprise in-jokes.  Superb supporting cast, including Dick Miller once again as the estranged hillbilly who believes that the gremlins are truly the World War II staples that the name infers.  An incredibly hilarious, yet terrifying mixture that is underrated, unappreciated, and unbelievably enjoyable.  Simply a campy work of art.  Note:  The gremlin's rendition of \\"New York, New York\\" is stupendous. <br />
B00025ETIW|4.0|this isn't really my type of music, but it's still pretty good. Im not Okay is probably not their best song, but the rest is really good. Im not Okay is reallll deceiving, I thought it was something like the used or soemthing, but these guys have a point. o and, about this EMO controversey, well everything is emo if you think about it. emo means emotional. every band has emotional backing into their songs. so what if a song is a bit on the depressing side? maybe the guy is depressed and he's expressing it through music?? you don't have to like the style, but it's deffinitly not cool to make fun of something because it's emotional. go back to listen to your favorite band. read the lyrics. for every song I have read lyrics to, is reall deep. also, when someone compares a band to another band, that's pretty much a bad review. review the band on it's own. don't bring sonic youth into it, cause sonic youth probably suck. but this is besides the point... <br /> <br />one more thing haha, but you need to actual listen to the album, and explore it. don't just listen to one song and say it sucks. maybe you dont like the sound, but I bet most of you who have put one star have only heard I'm Not Okay, which is probably one of their lower songs...it was jsut a lame excuse to be put on a radio station. and also buy the first album. much better <br /> <br />anyway, the best song on the album is The Ghost of You, real good song, and it has some heavy parts. great lyrics, and vocals <br />
B00003CX5P|3.0|simple as this - if you're a diehard star wars fan like me you'll either love, like or respect the movie.  if you're not a diehard fan you'll absolutely hate it.  <br /> <br />to everyone who shot this movie down ask yourself, \\"Could I really have done this better?\\"  and the answer would be \\"HELL NO\\".  It's not like you can just throw Carie Fisher, Harrison Ford, or Mark Hammil back in this movie.  I couldn't imagine how difficult it would be to make a prequel to star wars 15 years after the original so give the man (George Lucas) some respect. <br /> <br />Yes, after watching Episode 1 and wondering how he could ruin the series by putting this out, it's still needed to finish the story.  The actors suck for the most part (at least Padme is hot), the story sucks, the movie itself is rather boring, and you just want to strangle Jar Jar Binks beyond death. <br /> <br />I am a huge starwars fan so I at least liked it a little.  Had to get past the bad acting, though :D  No one on the face of this planet could have done it better then Lucas.  Thank God Episode II was better.  The third installment will be off the hook.     <br /> <br />
0679720200|3.0|I had the same reaction to this book as one might have looking at a Worhol piece: that is to say, there is something there, though nothing of any recognizable significance to the contemporary mind.<br /><br />Clearly, Camus' book really struck a chord with his peers and folks of his own generation. Specifically, there is no doubt that the advent of the end of WWII had a lot of people shaking their heads in contemplation of the madness the world had just witnessed. The knowledge of mankind's willingness to apply its cutting-edge technologies to the slaughter of foes and innocents alike (Re: barbed wire, land mines, tanks, ovens, wholesale bombing of civilian populations, wolf packs, kamikazis, flame throwers, atomic weapons) was a real eye-opener.<br /><br />What you see in the main character (if you can call him that), Meursault, is a true sociopath... less the paranoia. That is, this man is neither proactive nor purposeful in his actions. He reacts as a leaf on a limb in the wind.<br /><br />I am not sure what Camus' point is. Though come to think of it, maybe the point is there is none to begin with.<br /><br />I still look at Worhol's work and recognize that given the right context it may have made sense to me. But until that time, I think Worhol should be left to the fascination of the intelligensia of the art world. Similarly, The Stranger probably read better in 1950. It still might be okay with a latte at Starbuck's listening to 10,000 Maniacs (or, alternatively, the Cure). But I think the masses would be better off if Southebys just auctioned the whole lot off.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I am so disappointed in this album, I borrowed it from a friend when it first came out and just couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I won't even jump on it for being political, the music is just, bad, every song has an invisible meaning, on top of sounding like the entire album was written in 5 minutes. Now I love Green Day like they're my own children, but, I cannot endorse American Idiot. Surely they can do better.
6305291446|4.0|Director:  Steve Miner <br />Cast:  Jamie Lee Curtis, Josh Hartnett, Adam Arkin, LL Cool J, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Michelle Williams, Adam Hann-Byrd, Lyn O'Keefe. <br />Rated R for graphic violence, language, minor sexual situations and gore. <br />Running Time:  90 minutes. <br /> <br />Director Steve Miner (\\"Friday the 13th, Part III\\", \\"Forever Young\\") uses his similar, stylish tactics of his early 1980's \\"Friday the 13th\\" thrillers in this exceptional sequel. Now twenty years after the original Halloweens took place (basically forgetting sequels 3-6, thank God), Michael Myers returns to inflict even more terror on Laurie (reprised by scream-queen Jamie Lee Curtis in a fine performance).  Laurie struggles to put the fear of Michael away, even after two decades have passes since that dreadful night her deranged brother returned to Haddonfield, Illinois to kill her. <br /> <br />An alcoholic headmistress of her graduating son's (played by Josh Hartnett) private school, Laurie dreads the upcoming infamous fall holiday.  With the support from love interest Arkin (\\"Chicago Hope\\"), Laurie is coerced to believe that nothing bad is going to happen--until the dead bodies start to pile up.  As Laurie attempts to save her son from the horrific monster that is Myers, school security guard LL Cool J comes to the rescue.  The battle between good and evil leads to an exceptional climax in which Laurie takes on Michael herself in order to end the mayhem once and for all. <br /> <br />While not up to the caliber of the original, \\"Halloween: H20\\" makes up for the unfortunate loss of Dr. Loomis (played by Donald Pleasance, who passed away after during filming of the previous sequel) with excellent supporting roles from the charismatic LL Cool J and the underrated Arkin.  Full of chills and thrills, Steve Miner does a fine job setting up the shocks with his deliberate use of camera angles and a frightening musical score.  The opening scene is perhaps one of the most terrifying of alltime.  One of the better slasher films of the \\"Scream\\" era. <br />
B00009V7T2|5.0|purely delicous <br /> <br />If you dont like it, you are weird and probably dumb <br /> <br />No offense <br /> <br />I would also have to say that this album is better than 'frances' <br /> <br />Just trust me and freakin buy it
B000063UR2|5.0|It's great to have it all but I thought the Tangerine Dream score of the movie version was marvelous. I can't even think of Legend without it, it's like an extra character. I especially liked the music where Darkness stepped out of the mirror.
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil= COMALIES: Release Year, 2000 <br />  <br />1. Swamped-4- Best start, great lyrics and great vocal effort. <br /> <br />2. Heaven's A Lie-4- Beautiful string work and piano, vocals are questionable, at least from the male vocals of Andrea Ferro. <br /> <br />3. Daylight Dancers-4- Don't let the title fool you, this song is a great fast paced track. <br /> <br />4. Humane-3.5- Not the best, the song will get annoying at times, it depend on taste. <br /> <br />5. Self-Deception-3.5-Nice hard rock song, but is on the short side compared to the rest of the album, and the length of lyrics, kind of makes it feel like a lack in creativity, but don't get me wrong, it is a good song. <br /> <br />6. Aeon-4.5- Experimental? Yes, but it is good, for a 1m59s song, you will play it over and over, such great work done on this short song. <br /> <br />7. Tight Rope-4- Great tune work helps save the trite lyrics of this song, the tune is so well done, it has to be played more then once to catch everything. <br /> <br />8. The Ghost Woman And The Hunter-5-Cristina Scabbia takes a solo vocal spot for this song, and proves her vocal range. Her Soprano/Alto vocals prove successful. This is with a doubt the best vocal and tuned song on the album. <br /> <br />9.  Unspoken-4- Beautiful hard rock tune, again Andrea Ferro just takes a chorus vocal role for this one, letting Cristina take the spot light in this single worthy song. <br /> <br />10.  Entwined-4.5- Great song, Cristina and Andrea do well in this song, not the best tune on the album, but best vocal teamwork. <br /> <br />11.  The Prophet Said-4- Lacuna Coil plays with their fans a little with the beginning, putting in the same beginning they had for Waves Of Anguish on their Unleashed Memories Album, but this proves successful, as the tune takes a mixed soft and hard rock genre. <br /> <br />12.  Angel's Punishment-5- Cristina again, proves her vocal range, doing a bit of poetry on this one, just talking through most of the lyrics, but the difference between her speaking voice and singing voice will amaze fans. <br /> <br />13.  Comalies-4.5- This mix of English and Italian lyrics gives a great feeling and great ending to the album. It is a wonderful song, and even if you don't understand Italian, you will love it. <br /> <br />
B00008DDHZ|5.0|This film is an excellent account of what happened on Bloody Sunday. The above reviews in which people compare the IRA to Al Queda are obviously from people with little knowledge on the situation in Northern Ireland. It was not a march of victory nor was it for freedom from the UK; it was for civil rights so that Catholics may receive the same treatment as Protestants in a Protestant majority state. The previous review on how this film hindered rather than helped the peace process was made from a person who I feel is highly uneducated on the situation. This film shows a real account on what happened on this tragic day and it shows it fairly from both accounts. The acting was raw and very real as a lot of the actors in the shooting scenes were people who were there that day and the emotions they show was very real. In making this film both soldiers and civilians who were present on that fateful day were interviewed. The fact that it was shown as a documentary style film was to deliver as an accurate and believable film as possible and I think it succeeded immensely in doing so. If only more films were made as carefully as this one we might get to the truth on a lot more issues governments choose to sweep under their political carpet. And with regards to previous reviewers please don't make remarks on political issues you obviously no so little about.

B00008S2VG|5.0|Don't listen to any naysayers or silly critics worried that Madonna is \\"bashing America\\" -- that's silly. Madonna has created some of the finest eletronic-folk music ever to grace my ears. From the unique sound of the title track to the lush orchestration in \\"Nothing Fails\\", this is by far one of Madonna's most accomplished albums.
0060920084|1.0|Usually, Bryson is down right-laugh out loud funny... This book was a whiney travelogue of uninteresting places.   <br /> <br />There are many lovely, interesting small towns throughout the US, Bryson didn't find one of them. And similarly, there are numerous unique characters in the country and Bryson didn't meet any of them.  Just traveling around small towns, expecting some sort of revelation about yourself and life growing up in the middle of nowhere... could happen, but didn't. <br /> <br />Not a bright spot among these leaves! <br />
B000002U82|5.0|Hey, dude who keeps reviewing this album over and over, give it a rest already!  So, you're one who doesn't like it out of 50 zillion who do.  Get over it, and get a friggin' life! <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a great album, and to deny the talent and influence here is just ignorance.  Regardless of what you may think about drug use, these are undeniable talented writers and musicians.  (and remember what Bill Hicks said about drug use in music...) <br /> <br />I'm guessing you probably weren't gonna listen to that guy anyway, but uh, don't.  In this case, the (very) overwhelming majority is right.
0385338082|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it was well-paced, the main character was funny, and Sophie Kinsella tells a story that's as much fun as her Shopaholic series. I think the only reason I didn't give this five stars is that the story isn't all that original. Maybe I've just been reading too many chick lits, but I was ready for a different spin on the haphazardly messed-up (by messed-up I mean her love life, her job, her family) heroine. Still, it was a quick read.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I'm not going to make blind accusations or judgements because I don't know who the hell Trent Reznor is in reality, and I can bet you neither does anyone else who's written a review of With Teeth. I can tell you what Nine Inch Nails is to me, but that's just me, and just Nine Inch Nails. And I protect my oppinions, so if you don't like them, then go to hell. <br /> <br />Basically what I'm saying is, my oppinions aren't facts, so don't die over them. <br /> <br />Nine Inch Nails is so unique because every NIN album is its own, not to be catagorized or judged, as people do. And yet, there are traces of one album in the next, because it's the same project, and the same person. And too many people take this as \\"Every Album is Exactly the Same.\\" And that is dumb. What I've learned is that you can't compare two NIN albums. It's just not fair, it's like trying to compare a great Marilyn Manson album with a great Beatles album. Every album plays its part, and I don't care what people say, With Teeth does that very well. It's just something you can't replicate, that you can't repeat without REALLY knowing what repetition is. So everyone quit your pseudo-intelligent criticism on the little details that make With Teeth a percent under 100. Half the arguments I've heard aren't even valid at all. <br /> <br />For everyone saying that Nine Inch Nails had always held an \\"edge\\" or whatever, up until this album, please look back to Broken. Now, I love Broken. I've never heard anything else like it anywhere. BUT!! It doesn't stray too far from that general hardcoreness for too long at any point. Which, to many, means that there is no variety. So for whoever of you that love Broken but hate With Teeth because it's all the same, please, please get off of the NIN trapeze. I hate you. <br /> <br />(I maintain that the above statements are stricktly oppional.)
0316168815|3.0|I usually pass hyped books; yet, a friend had recommended The Lovely Bones, so I ventured into Susie's world of heaven and earth. Susie's experience mirrors my own childhood idea of journey from life to death.  The concept of wanting to comfort those you love, while you have absolutely no ability to do so. Though the story moves along quickly enough, the murderer was uninterestingly obvious.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best jazz albums ever created. Over the years I have collected several hundred albums by all different artists. I have a particular affection for trumpet, and especially for Miles.  <br /> <br />This album was the first ever given to me, and is the gold standard by which all other music I have ever heard or owned is judged. My collection started with this and since has turned into a runaway train.  <br /> <br />If I had to give up the rest of my music, I could survive for eternity with this album. There is nothing more to say, just listen.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|The acting of this movie is amazing, especially Jim Carey's acting and his ability to show the range of emotions - hurt, pain, anger, rage, the wrestle betwen forcing the memory out of the mind and the difficulty of letting go. <br /> <br />Inspiring is the only word I can explain about this movie.  If you have a scientific mind who loves to rationalize, this movie is complex for you and you will not understand the morale behind the film.  Nothing wrong with you but this movie is not your kind.  But if you are an artist who understands a variety of deep emotions and the pain one goes through in relationships, you will fall in love with the movie. <br /> <br />Lesson learned in this movie is that memory cannot be erased because they are too painful.  You cannot try to forget the memories because it is stored in your brain, your soul.  Every time you try to erase your memory, your soul is crying and struggling.  When you try to shut them away, there is always more coming back.  If you think you can erase your painful memories in order to \\"gain\\" the spotless, perfect mind, you can never achieve it because your mind, your soul is still crying, struggling between storing and forgetting.  It is painful enough to go through a break up.  But why are we doing this to ourselves trying to forget the memories, hoping the pain attached to it is removed?  Why do we put ourselves through so much struggle?  The movie proves a point that no matter how advance science is, we still cannot remove memories and pain out of our mind, our heart.  Instead of using advance medical equipment and the brightest scientists to erase memories, we human beings get engaged into all kinds of self medication methods trying to forget the pain (rebound relationships, exercising, alcohol, work, TV, video games, sex, keeping ourselves \\"busy\\", getting to involved into others' lives).  The pain seems numbed and erased but it is stored subconsiously somewhere else, waiting for something/someone to trigger itback.   <br /> <br />Heartbreaks are painful, extremely painful.  Our hearts are fragile but it can be healed. The only way to heal the painful suffering experiences is through grieving.  Honor your pain and honor your memories.  Don't shut it away because memories won't just go away no matter how clever you are.  Pay every one of your emotions full respect and experience it.  Let yourself cry when needed.  Let yourself write and draw when needed.  Don't shut yourself down but be gentle to yourself.  Love yourself and listen to your pain without judgment.  The pain seems forever to heal but it is not true.  One day, eventually one can wake up in the morning realizing the memory are still stored in the mind, but the pain has left leaving a scar.  Scars are like beautiful tatoos on our body to appreciate.  The moment of drawing the tatoo on our body is painful.  But when you have healed from the pain, you will appreciate the piece of art crafted in your emotional body.  That piece of art is attached to you till the day you die.  Just like the learned lessons that will be attached in your mind till the day you die.  People can only grow out of painful experience or running away from the pain.  When you run away, you will find the experience coming back and haunt you.  The pain will be triggered some point in the life time again.  When you grow out of the painful experience, you become empowered and fearless about life. <br /> <br />Thank you for reading my review.          <br /> <br />
6304711905|5.0|The story of Wyatt Earp is fairly well known. People have heard of the gunfight at the OK Corral. Doc Holliday is a name known from legend. All these elements and more are present. I have no idea how historically accurate their portrayals are and I don't care. What I do care about is that this was a fun movie. <br /> <br />Wyatt Earp and his brothers move to Tombstone to try and put their pasts behind them and cash in on the silver rush. While there, they get sucked back into the law enforcement business and try to clean up the town for decent folk. The problem is that the bad guys are really bad. As a result, the bad guy body count just keeps climbing until Wyatt triumphs. That's the story but it is not the \\"entertainment\\". <br /> <br />I like seeing the bad guys get their comeuppance as well as the next guy but what makes this movie work is a combination of the story and the characterizations and the acting and the cinematography. It's all good. Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday does an especially fine job but the others get kudos as well. The good guys are \\"good\\" but they do have their human problems as well. The bad guys are nothing but bad and, eventually, dead. <br /> <br />No one is going to earn academic credit for the history in this movie (I hope). That is beside the point. The purpose of this one is to see the good guys beat the bad guys and feel good about it. That alone is worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />Put your mind on hold and just sit back to enjoy it.

B0001AP12G|3.0|No doubt Kanye West had a tremendous influence in this years rap scene, some for the better and some for the worst. I dont think his rapping style is new enough or innovative enough to be considered classic yet. his production style is too repetitive and those dam chipmunk noises get on my f---ing nerves! Through The Wire is pretty wack. Come on people. He re-named an old school song with the word WIRE in it?!?! Anyways, as a plus-he raps about the hood and things besides the typical rapper, which is refreshing. He also dresses like a college prep student, even though he is a college dropout. The best song is by far ALL FALLS DOWN.  There is a reason why he didnt win best new artist, and yes... Maroon 5 was overrated and shouldnt have won either.
0553573403|4.0|This is quite the fantasy novel. It fulfills everything we normally ask of the genre: well-drawn characters, likable, lovable and detested; sweeping, historic events; mysteries and secret schemes; love, triumph, disaster and tragedy; a fully realized and fleshed-out, internally consistent world with many things to learn and marvel at; an incredibly intricate plot spanning years and dozens and dozens of characters. The writing is clean and clear (with the one caveat listed below), the pacing is fine, the events well orchestrated and the rotating narration admirably executed.<br /><br />It probably should get five stars. However, I give it four for the following two reasons:<br /><br />Reading Thrones is like watching the third round (not quite the first or the second) of a classic heavyweight fight; it knows that it's going the distance, and so here it's feeling things out, testing the waters, establishing its jab if you will. The author obviously has many, many things to say with this series, and he's obviously up to the challenge. At 800 pages, it never felt long. And yet, and for this reason, most of the novel ultimately felt like prologue. Yes, major events do happen and there is some payoff sprinkled along the way... but there are also huge swaths of novel that are almost entirely foreshadowing and rising tension for things yet to come. The reward is withheld, and for that reason in part, one star less. It might be argued that, since I know that the author is merely setting the dominoes for a later fall, I should award him the final star in anticipation. I disagree however; I think that a novel, and especially one of this length, should be arranged to be a stand-alone experience, if need be. It's a prejudice of mine, perhaps, but there it is.<br /><br />The second reason (and I almost hesitate to write this section, because to call attention to minor flaws like this seems to disrespect the overall achievement and marvel of the novel entire, but alas, I am a critic) is this: the writing is inconsistent and slightly unruly. Obviously, as implied above, Martin is a wonderful storyteller. What I mean is that his language is, at times, off-kilter and inconsistent. Maybe to expect more from such an immense project is unfair, but allow me to provide a few examples. Sometimes it seems as though the characters know that they're in an epic fantasy novel, their language is so affected. Perhaps as so many of the characters are courtiers, it explains their pretensions (though they speak that way in private to loved ones, while in dire straits, too), but what of the pretensions of the writer who also seems to understand that he's in a high fantasy world. There are knights in Martin's world. And, they are called \\"knights.\\" Yet their title is \\"Ser\\" as in \\"Ser George Martin.\\" Not \\"Sir,\\" but \\"Ser.\\" Why? They aren't \\"Masters\\" they're \\"Maesters.\\" Why? It's not a \\"jailer\\" but a \\"gaoler.\\" Why? These peculiarities stand out. I truly wish that fantasy authors would realize that it isn't a change in language that makes a world distinctive, and of course, if it were, then what place would wolves, stags and Kings have in this \\"distinct world?\\" But if we keep \\"King\\" and \\"your Grace\\" then why not \\"Sir\\" instead of \\"Ser?\\" And, in the case of \\"gaoler\\" why adopt older English when keeping modern English for most everything else? Inconsistent and silly. Other times, however, the narration drops all pretense and becomes stark and brutal, or even sophomoric: \\"Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt\\" (204). In the first place, what a juvenile description. In the second, I doubt a person with a dagger up anything walks particularly stiffly. The problem I'm getting at is no biggie--just a matter of consistency in narrative voice and good rationale for some other language choices--but I do believe that it is worth about .4 of a star. Also, over the course of the novel, it becomes apparent that Martin hashis own favorite ways of putting things. \\"As [blank] as sin\\" has been used twice (smooth and soft) and he's used \\"As certain as sunrise\\" along with \\"As certain as sunset.\\" The term \\"game of thrones\\" has been used multiple times in dialogue by different characters. And, okay, this is picky and I understand that, but still, if I notice it then it calls attention away from the story and focuses me on the craft of writing. And that's not what Martin is trying to do; that's bad.<br /><br />In the end, my review comes down to this: I feel it necessary to defend my choice to give the book four stars instead of five, and I could perfectly understand others giving it full marks. I'm a picky person who obsesses over errors and who probably chose the right career when I taught High School English. My neuroses aside, if you have any passing interest in the genre, this is almost a must-read, and tomorrow I plan on going out to buy the second in the series. My only hope is that the strengths of the first, which well outweigh any small flaws, continue throughout.in has his own favorite ways of putting things. \\"As [blank] as sin\\" has been used twice (smooth and soft) and he's used \\"As certain as sunrise\\" along with \\"As certain as sunset.\\" The term \\"game of thrones\\" has been used multiple times in dialogue by different characters.

B00008S2VG|2.0|There's nothing too redeemable on this record, except that she gives the word 'rap' a whole new meaning. Think it's time to 'wrap' it up. Her dance records weren't too bad in the 80's, but this is just plain boring. And her voice is just 'there.'    I think a lot of people have lost interest, and there won't be much ado made with future efforts.
6305508550|3.0|How sad for all of us that the Bill Lumberghs of the world--the men (and women) who most desperately need Office Space--won't be able to \\"get it.\\" <br /> <br />Those of us who do \\"get it,\\" however, will love this send up of office life. Much like the wonderful series The Office (U.K. version), Office Space tears into the insanity of our working lives with deadly, painful accuracy. It is obvious that Mike Judge has talent with satire, and this film makes me hope that he plans on producing more in this area in the future. <br /> <br />Eventually, the movie pushes the satire to the back-burner and concentrates on telling a romance story with Jennifer Aniston. When it does, the movie loses a little steam as their relationship is simply not as interesting as watching characters like Lumbergh, the receptionist or the waiter with the perma-smile on his face. <br /> <br />But that aside, this movie is a classic satire that will be quoted by your friends for years to come, and is definitely something that needs to be watched to be clued-in to the culture of modern, working America. A must see. <br />
B000929AJQ|5.0|I am a big fan of NIN.  anyone knows that for trent it really doesnt get better than The Downward Spiral.  i feel this cd had just as much of his soul in it as downward spiral did.  the fragile was a let down and trent cleaned up his act.  he did a recent interview in rolling stone that told all about the ups and downs he went through over the years.  i truly feel that this cd is one of the best that NIN put out. <br /> <br />trent is putting exactly what he feels into this album and that is what should determine greatness.  his lyrics express the way he feels about his career and what being popular beyond belief is about.  when you hear a song and say to your self, \\"wow i guess i never saw it that way,\\" that is what grestness is about.  when someone can make you realize what you didnt see before then that is something.   <br /> <br />i think that he has really busted out of his shell and made a great album.  i love this cd because of the lyrics more than anything.  is it as dark as most of his other cds? no.  but it gets the message through the same.  its not often that an artist can put out a flop of a cd but come back the way he did.  that is amazing especially for the time we live in when one bad incident can follow you for the rest of your life.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Napoleon Dynamite will be remembered far into the future. By some, at least, to whom this movie will sit comfortably alongside similar \\"cult\\" type movies. Others-most, I'd suspect-will watch it and wonder what all the fuss is about. And so, you must ask yourself: what group do you most likely fall into? Are you into the cult-type films? Or more mainstream than that? Your answer to that question probably answers how you'll feel about this movie.    The main problem with the movie, it seems to me, is that it isn't really about anything in particular, plot-wise. Rather, it's a collection of character sketches, loosely tied together by a plot that feels tacked-on because the writer realized that he needed a plot of some sort. Whether Napoleon's friend Pedro does, or does not, win his election (which provides the climax to the movie), is almost completely irrelevant to the film as a whole. Except for the cool `Vote for Pedro' shirts that some people wear now, the election could have been totally removed from the film and I expect that it would seem basically the same. It could also be said that \\"Napoleon finding someone to connect with\\" is also what the film is about, but really, it's not. That may or may not happen over the course of the film, but Napoleon's character is, himself, so lukewarm about his relationships that it can't really provide a focus.    As a collection of character sketches, the movie is hit or miss. A lot of the characters are very broadly drawn and seem cartoonish. The tone of the film, itself, is not cartoony or slapstick or absurd-it seems to want to portray reality in some way. And so the characters and the film appear to clash at times, providing an interesting if slightly disturbing experience.    And so: why will this film achieve cult status, and why is it so popular? Because the main character sketch-Napoleon Dynamite, himself-is brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed. Otherwise, this is not particularly a great film, per se. The story is inconsequential, it teaches little to nothing, the writing is average, the direction forgettable, the acting passable to silly, etc. But what it does do is it creates an Icon. Napoleon Dynamite will be remembered because the eponymous character will be remembered. Napoleon Dynamite is a nerd protagonist, but (and strikingly different from the norm) he is not a hero. He really isn't even likable, and is kind of a jerk. Vastly different from, say, the Tri-Lambda house, who were nerds out of a sense of self and integrity and \\"being who they are,\\" Napoleon is the way he is either out of a philosophical myopia or, because strangely, he's trying to be cool. He's kind of like an arrogant jock character in that he looks down on most people; they differ because 1) no one agrees with Napoleon's sense of the cool and 2) jocks are strong enough to enforce their ideas and Napoleon isn't. Of course, underneath his (ineffectual, funny) bluster, we can see that (just like most of the arrogant jocks) he suffers from low-self esteem and looks for others approval to validate him. That's why he lies about things like \\"hunting for wolverines.\\" In short, Napoleon isn't a movie-nerd, heroic and decent, just misunderstood; he's a real-nerd, struggling and sometimes self-loathing with a patina of false-pride. We have, all of us, known a Napoleon Dynamite at one point or another in our lives, and we've always wondered: why? This movie doesn't ever really answer that question, but it does show us enough reality that we have some evidence upon which to guess. And that's pretty cool.
B000002U82|5.0|This is a true story, I swear.  When I was little, I was born blind.  Completely blind.  From the early days of my youth, my parents would play this album for me.  I must have heard it thousands of times by the time I turned 6.  Anyway, one day, I was listening to it, as I had many times before, and something happened.  By some miraculous turn of events, I began to see.  It was like a window being opened, and suddenly I was given the gift of sight.  I cannot explain it, but Pink Floyd's music has cured my blindness, and now my vision is nearly perfect.  If they can do this for me, just imagine what they could do for you.  God bless you Pink Floyd.  You are truly amazing guys.
B0007TKNII|2.0|If you've never seen the broadway production, you very well may like this movie.  I, however, have.  I was highly disappointed with this movie.  The vocals were not even remotely comparable and most of acting was just plain bad.  This movie, in no way, did justice to the REAL thing.
B0007NFL18|1.0|Amazingly enough, I Now have a worst album to talk about, the album is the massacre, this is an historic landmark for me in the 20 years since I've been to florida, this is the closest thing for me to not buying the album nor downloading any song from the album on the internet and when I Look at the experience, I Wish I Had.    I Thought every single song (except baltimore love thing) is absolutely horrible especially candy shop which is the worst song I Have ever seen.    The Beats is horrible, the writing is horrible and the GGGGG G-Unit catch phrase is the worst catch phrase creation of all time.    This is possibly the lead contender for the worst album of 2005 and will be tied with Beg for mercy for the worst album of this decade.    and there is no reason for 50 and his trashy group to be in the music industry on any level.    Here I Thought 98% Percent of the bad rap was gonna be the worst I Listen to in my life, believe it or not one star reviewers    The Massacre and 50 is even worse.    A Big Thumbs Down for Me on the Massacre    Music Rating: NO STARS.
B00005K9LN|2.0|This is regarded as a classic metal album, but is extremely dated and has aged horribley. BRITISH STEEL is really not all that great, especialy when you compare it to what else came out in 1980: Black Sabbath released the exellent HEAVEN AND HELL, AC/DC come out with the greatest rock album of all time, BACK IN BLACK, Ozzy Osbourne unleashed his solo debut BLIZZARD OF OZ, Motorhead came out with their best ACE OF SPADES, The Scorpions put out ANIMAL MAGNETISM and there was the first IRON MAIDEN lp as well. Each and every one of the above efforts mentioned utterly destroys BRITISH STEEL with out breaking a sweat. It is really one of the most overrated albums ever put out, the songs are just half @$$ed metal at best. The two best songs were Rapid Fire and Grinder, forget about everything else because it is just the beging of heavy metal becoming foolish. When people talk about Def Leppard or Motley Crue being one dimentinonal clished pop metal, Judas Preist should be right up there with them, BREAKING THE LAW and LIVING AFTER MIDNIGHT basically gave birth to the insipid pop metal scene that polutted the 80's. <br /> <br />OVERRATED!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I love this cd...I listen to it all day long!! I'm so glad she's back.. Highly recommend it for those who have yet to experience... <br />
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd is better than every band I've ever heard.  Better than Led Zeppelin, better than the Beatles, better than Mozart, better than NSinc, better than Perry Como, better than Michael Jackson, better than ABBa, better than George Strait, why, they're even better than A Flock of Seagulls.  You have no idea how good Pink Floyd really is.  There's nothing like kicking back with a cold beer, and chilling out to some Pink Floyd.  I recommend you do that.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I did notice a clearer picture overall when comparing it to the first DVD release, since it does say high definition. As far as audio is concerned...havent ran it on a legitimate 5.1 or better system to compare the audios...email me if anyone knows if this new version is remastered, again?<br /><br />jorgejz@bellsouth.net
140003180X|5.0|How to express to everyone how happy this series makes me. The characters continue to delight, like visiting a wonderful group of friends that you can't get enough of. It is McCall Smith's valentine to Botswana, and Precious and her crew don't disappoint. For me,the cases almost become secondary to the personal lives that slowly reveal with each subsequent book, which is why I've said nothing about what this case involves. Just know that if you're as big of a fan as I am, you'll certainly want to read this.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|What I found most disturbing, having seen the play, was the choice in actors. Minnie Driver? Why? She didn't even sing until the credits. I also felt that, and especially going from stage to screen, there was less enthusiasm and passion from the actors. Men, how would you feel in either Raul or Erik's, the Phantom's, place. And ladies, being stalked by an obsessed, par-omniscient suitor wouldn't garner a little more fear atop the opera house? My gripe is this, given the magnificence of the play, live on stage, a rehearsed, much more polished product should have been produced. Especially when one hears Webber's comments about how he felt the book was trash and Leroux's lack of writing skill. Maybe Leroux should have stole other authors' ideas? (Interview on disk 2). Lon Cheney's 1920's Phantom, while paling to the immense resources of Webber, still holds more madness, sorrow, and even redemption, HOWEVER, do not miss disk's 2 stand alone \\"aria\\" by the lonesome, now beaten phantom, the actor hit the emotion on the one piece of film not included in the feature. You could always rent it, and read the book. Webber may be brilliant and pompous but he's not always right, Leroux's book proves that, it has human intensity and far more psychology. If you do buy the dvd, the 2 disk edition is the way to go if you're like me, I'm interested in set and stage buildings, the actors and all the bonuses. If you can't see the play though, and this catches your liking, get a copy of the original scores from the play, they DESTROY the ones in the film. Minnie Driver?? Minnie Driver??? Why?
B00006AW2G|5.0|Let It Bleed rules, and is part of the Stones' classic foursome of albums (Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street), which may constitute the greatest consecutive-album streak in the history of rock and roll.  Without question, they were the anti-Beatles, and the music on this album represents a real demonic, chilling evil.  In fact, three of the songs on Let It Bleed rank among the Stones' best -- and I don't count \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", which I consider to be the Stones' most overrated song.<br /><br />At this time, Gram Parsons was hanging out with the Stones more and more, having left the Byrds and becoming less and less interested in the Flying Burrito Brothers.  His influence is all over this record, as well as Sticky Fingers and Exile.<br /><br />But with all of that said, I rank Let It Bleed as #4 in this classic foursome.  Here are my reasons.<br /><br />I don't prefer \\"Country Honk\\" to \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" -- I don't think it sounds fresher, just sloppy.  I don't understand why Keith Richards was ever allowed to sing one note for the Stones, so I always skip over \\"You Got The Silver\\".  Finally, \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" is too overwrought, and was subsequently ruined than hipper-than-thou American culture, and bad movies like The Big Chill.  \\"Love In Vain\\" is a fine tune, but sounds faintly pedestrian when compared to the songs on the other three albums.  I also have the same complaints about the title track.<br /><br />However, this album does have \\"Live With Me\\", which is a pulsating rocker, and three all-time Stones classics:  \\"Gimme Shelter\\", \\"Midnight Rambler\\" and \\"Monkey Man\\".  Those songs are complete and total jams, and they alone elevate this album from \\"good\\" to \\"great\\".<br /><br />Finally, I would rank the Stones' top four albums as follows:<br /><br />1. Sticky Fingers<br /><br />2. Exile On Main Street<br /><br />3. Beggars Banquet<br /><br />4. Let It Bleed<br /><br />But really, they should all be ranked as 1, 1A, 1B and 1C.should all be ranked as 1, 1A, 1B and 1C.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I have to say, I was a little disappointed in this movie. I try to seperate my love of the books from how I view the movie, but it is difficult. There are several important plot details left out and some new ones created unnecessarily. Adding in some of the left-out details would not even have made the movie much longer, so I was disappointed in that. I thought the movie was good and well-done, but it was not as faithful an interpretation of the book as the 1st two movies, directed by Chris Columbus. The movie was also somewhat unnecessarily dark. Darkness really pervaded the movie, but in terms of the books, this darkness would not really be appropriate until the fifth book, or perhaps part of the fourth. I really have to recommend the book HIGHLY over the movie, and quite frankly, it makes me very concerned for how much of the 4th book they will have to cut out to make it a movie. I wonder if it will even be worth watching. I still give the movie 4 stars, however, because it is good, and I do love the HP series, but do NOT expect it to be faithful to the book--salient details are left out. Think of it instead as being somewhat loosely based on the book, and enjoy it for what it is. Also, the kids have grown up a bit, and their acting skills have improved, so that is a definite plus.
B00000634J|5.0|This John Lennon cd is pretty complete and has all the great songs he did in his solo career.  John Lennon's voice was one of the best and just sounded so magical.  The sound was average and not the best but that's o.k.  It's a excellent price also.  I recommend this cd to anybody except the huge John Lennon fan, they can go and buy his box set.  I'm glad i bought this cd and I hope you're glad too if you buy this.  Keep on listening to classic rock and have a great day.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the year. It sucks you right in to the imaginitive mind of JM Barrie, creator of Peter Pan, and gives you a glimpse into what his life was like. A heartwarming tear-jerker, it's destined to become a fast classic. After seeing it only once, I knew I had to own it, and it is loved (in my experience) by men and women of all ages (it's not a chick flick!) Highly HIGHLY recommended.
B00006RAKP|4.0|I would never buy a Elton John cd because of the person he is so thankfully my sister bought it for me.  I loved this cd.  It has 34 songs and that's pretty good artwork on the front of the cd.  It is in good condition and the songs sound fine.  Elton John is a great singer but i am just so dissapointed in him.  His lifestyle is very bad.  Keep on listening to great music and start caring more about other people than yourself.
B00000C28M|3.0|Having read the other reviews I thought this would be worth buying for interest but really poor sound quality. <br /> <br />The sound quality is indeed pretty bad in places (rather like a poor transfer of an old 78 recording). Though not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I can't imagine where they placed the microphones, presumably right at the back of the auditorium (or possibly in the bar judging by the amount of audience movement, not to mention an almost constant cacophony of coughing). <br /> <br />I can understand that the tempos caused a few raised eyebrows at the time, though none are really so extreme. The first movement in particular is quite slow but full of passion. If Bernstein disagreed with the interpretation then it doesn't show in the orchestral passions around. In fact the speed allows all sorts of orchetral lines and textures to be brought out that are usually obscured. <br /> <br />On the whole a recording worth listening to (if only for the historical value) and worth getting a copy of, though don't expect a digital or remastered quality transfer! <br /> <br />Gould (as usual) sings his way through the performance - and can be clearly heard throughout - no mean feat with the volume of the orchestra. Good on yer! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000006ZGF|5.0|\\"Still Waters\\" closed out the Century as the Bee Gees last studio album. Featuring the big hit \\"Alone\\"; cuts \\"I Surrender\\", \\"Still Waters Run Deep\\" and \\"Smoke And Mirrors\\" could all have been big hits. \\"Irresistible Force\\" brings the famous trio in to a round-robin vocal that is truly unique. \\"My Lovers Prayer\\", \\"I Could Not Love You More\\" and \\"I Will\\" harken back to the power ballads the guys are so famous for. \\"Closer Than Close\\" and \\"Miracles Happen\\" seem out of step with the rest of the CD, but, hey, it's all good stuff.<br /><br />BIG PLUS!  This rare Japanese Import contains songs from the singles, \\"Rings Around The Moon\\" and \\"Love Never Dies\\".  You are in for a real treat, if you can find this at any cost!
B000002513|5.0|To get an idea of the impact of these songs, particularly \\"Incident\\", just read the concert reviews on springsteen's discussion board at springsteen.net. People write about this song with awe, they say that the solo piano acoustic version was the highlight of some of his acoustic shows. I wonder if Bruce could play a solo piano version of NYC Serenade, now that would blow me away! <br /> <br />I love every song on this album, it's hard to describe how good they all are. Why can't anyone write and perform like this anymore? People go nuts 30  years later when he plays any song from this album, that alone is all you need to know.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I absolutly love this cd. I think it is much better than their last album. It is definatly worth picking this up if you like NIN.
B0007CNXUK|1.0|Do yourself a favor and skip to the ending, that way you can get to the point of the story. The story is slow and boring.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|This is a genuine Priest's album. I have waited for a long time, and I really enjoy the ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION now. Rob is screaming here and there, and K.K. and Glenn are playing incredible guitar solos. 'Judas Rising' is an anthem which brings Priest back to the world of heavy metal. Guitar solos of 'Deal With The Devil' are as good as those of 'Electric Eye', and of 'The Sentinel'. 'Hellrider' reminds me of 'Painkiller'.  <br /> <br />I am sure that this album will survive the test of time. Priest is one and only heavy metal band, and the music they play is heavy metal. Therefore, Priest is called 'The Metal God'. After all sorts of troubles and difficulties, Priest is in their golden age again. I feel like I'm dreaming. The Priest is back!!!
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|WHy? The latter reviews, R GREAT!!

B0002IVN9W|5.0|A debut called Funeral would surely be the death of most bands, but not The Arcade Fire. You can just imagine the reviewers waiting to pounce on such a title, but guess what - it ain't gonna happen.. this cd is superb. The quite fragile vocals bring to mind Grandaddy or Mercury Rev but The Arcade Fire seem somehow to have something more, maybe the backing vocals, almost like a native american chant at times, painting spiritual colors in just the right places... Oh, and one more thing, I can't believe the people the gave this a bad review after buying it on the strenght of a friends recommendation or good review they read - always try before you buy!!!
B0002DKCMG|4.0|A 2004 movie.  \\"Unrated Version\\" contains both male and female nudity (includes some hot women and large number of men (men at nude beach)). <br /> <br />DVD Features: The DVD contains an unrated version of the movie and some Special Features.  The Special Features include: Commentaries (two versions: Filmmakers' Commentary and Party Along Commentary); a gag reel; deleted scenes (with or without commentary and includes 13 deleted scenes); Alternate Ending (with or without Commentary); a helpful Nude Scene Index (apparently 10 scenes (the index involves a picture and an down arrow)); Unrated Scene Index (8 scenes; if this index is correct, then the R rated theater version must not have had much if any nudity); Nude Beach Exposed (something of a \\"documentary\\" of the scene); a featurette called \\"How to Pick a Director\\" (apparently all three writers worked together and they had to chose one to be credited as the director); \\"Eurotrip Bootleg\\" (writers commentary for a Chinese bootleg copy of the movie); \\"The Music of Eurotrip\\" (an ad for the soundtrack; a music video; and a \\"Sing-A-Long\\"); Photo Gallery; Script; Production Notes; Cast bios; and the filmmakers biography. <br /> <br />Plot: The movie opens with some students graduating from high school and a one of the student's (Scott) getting dumped by his girlfriend, Fiona (\\"Smallville's\\" Kristin Kreuk).  After this dumping sequence, Scott and friends go to a graduation party, where Fiona's music boyfriend plays a song about Fiona (Scott is boring and Fiona is a tramp).  While Scott's friends (the twins; Cooper plans on working at a law firm) plan on backpacking in Europe, Scott plans on staying home and working.  This changes when his German \\"pen pal\\" invites \\"himself\\" to America.  Scott freaks out that the \\"man\\" wants to \\"sleep\\" with him.  This German, \\"Mike,\\" helped Scott in German class.  And Scott had been confused, it wasn't Mike but Mieke (a female; it is momentarily funny when Scott realizes that Mieke is female, and he had sent an e-mail basically blowing her off).  Scott decides to head off to Europe with his friend Cooper as couriers to try to meet Mieke after she blocks his e-mail (she lives in Germany; they are sent to London and assume they can \\"walk\\" to Berlin, and Cooper hasn't told his law firm that he is off to Europe).  Remember, the rest of the gang, the twins, are also heading to Europe on a backpacking trip (though they don't head over together, they join each other's groups in Paris).  The gang has a lot of adventures in Europe, including scenes in night clubs, trains and nude beaches, and then the movie ends. <br /> <br />Credits: The movie stars Scott Mechlowisz (Scott Thomas), Michelle Trachtenberg (Jenny; from \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" TV show), Jacob Pitts (Cooper Harris; \\"K-19\\"), Jessica Boehrs (Mieke; musical artist in Germany); Travis Wester (Jamie; \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\"), Lucy Lawless (Madame Vandersexxx; \\"Xena\\"), Vinnie Jones (Head Hooligan; \\"Snatch\\"), and Fred Armisen (Creepy Italian Guy; \\"Anchorman\\").  Jenny and Jamie are supposed to be twins.  The credited director is Jeff Schaffer.   <br /> <br />Review: Interesting opening credit sequence, displaying the credits against an animated airline safety pamphlet, though the music is a little annoying.   Somewhat annoyingly, the \\"fourth wall\\" is broken and one of the kids (Cooper, the \\"hard\\" or \\"bad\\" member of the group) notes \\"there's your R rating right there\\" when he spots some nude women in a hot top at the graduation party (though Cooper certainly knows how to talk a topless woman, who doesn't particularly like him, to fondle herself in front of him).    <br /> <br />The film is a comedy and there are some amusing moments, some of which are down right funny (especially the scene where Jamie is robbed in Amsterdam; and the scene where Scott attempts to speak German with a truck driver).  There are actually some more funny moments than I expected, but most of the moments just cause a brief laugh.Some of the scenes, though some scenes have a tendency to go on too long.   <br /> <br />The acting is good enough for this type of movie, though not the best in the world.  The music includes some of the same music also appeared in National Lampoon's European Vacation.  Let's see, they visit London, Paris, some French village (\\"famous nude beach\\" location), Amsterdam, the capital of Slovakia, Berlin and Rome.  For the most part, the settings look like they might actually be in Europe, but few landmarks are spotted to confirm the location.   <br /> <br />Nice how they quickly dropped that courier angle.   <br /> <br />Interesting movie, some funny moments.  (4.14) <br />
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Well, I won't bore you all with another long rant about the shaky camera sequences and split-second scene changes.  They're both in here all over the place and I have my own qualms with them.  But honestly, folks, does this make or break the film for you?  If anything, I believe that all of the commentary on the \\"shaky-cam\\" techniques points to a far deeper problem lurking in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY: the lack of a logical and interesting plotline.  Sure, there are some pluses in this film.  I really enjoy watching Matt Damon as an action/spy hero.  He's good at it and believable.  I love seeing him take out squadrons of men with a few martial arts moves and escape from impossible situations with ease and flare.  He handles the dueling characteristics of brains and brawn quite well and can also handle women.  I just wish that he would do so inside of a film that made sense and was interesting.<br /><br />Of course, I am not asking for a completely realistic action film.  Such a thing is impossible, perhaps, and would be boring if it were actually accomplished.  No...what I ask for is simply an entertaining action storyline that flows from point-to-point with logical grace and simplicity.  Much of the storyline in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is simply hard to follow and extraneous.  We love to see our action hero fighting against the best of the best.  We just want to know why he is doing it.<br /><br />I honestly hope that we have not seen the last of Jason Bourne.  Matt Damon is very interesting to watch and I feel that with a better plotline this series can be recovered.  If you enjoyed THE BOURNE IDENTITY, you'll want to check out this film.  But for several reasons I feel that THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is inferior to its predecessor.  Let's hope a third can reclaim Bourne's identity among the great spy flicks of all time.
B000929AJQ|4.0|I've been a NIN fan since 1993, and have most of their stuff aside from a couple of remix albums.  After hearing the radio song \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", I was not too impressed, but that's nothing new i.e. \\"Closer\\", \\"We're in This Together Now\\", and \\"Starf**kers Inc.\\" were definitely not the best songs on their respective albums, just the most palatable to the general public.  But after one listen to the entire album, I thought there were only a couple of songs I thought were really great, with most being mediocre.  But one thing that is called to mind that Trent said after release of The Fragile is that he hopes people like his albums more after several listens than the first time.  Well that definitely happened in this case, and that's a good thing.  After several listens now, this album is definitely on the same level as the other previous releases.  The tracks in order from best to worst in my opinion are:  1) Sunspots, 2) Every Day is Exactly the Same, 3) Only, 4) The Line Begins to Blur, 5) Right Where It Belongs, 6) Love Is Not Enough, 7) All the Love in the World, 8) You Know Who You Are?, 9) With Teeth, 10) Beside You In Time, 11) The Hand that Feeds, 12) The Collector, 13) Getting Smaller.  But really only the last two don't do much for me.  Trent's voice is definitely at its best on this album, the lyrics are great, and really convey in a personal way how it feels to deal with the world sober after years of not doing so (something I relate to personally), and the mixing is superb.  I love the synth sounds on many of the tracks that harken back to 80's new wave (Only, Every Day is Exactly the Same), and also really like the funky feel on some of the tracks.  All in all, quite a good album, second in my opinion only to The Fragile.  I like where Trent is going, and predict with his newfound sobriety (which I sincerely hope he can keep) that he'll have another album out in about 3 years.
B0007P3582|1.0|I agree with Pete. Rap used to be good when Public Enemy was doing it back in the late 80's, but then rap became one of the major sellout genres of all times when the new millenium dawned. Actually, I don't care for rap, as I listen to rock music, but the most overrated and sold out is 50 Cent. Listening to this \\"music\\" is as pleasant as getting burned by acid. Why does Amazon only have the option of one star? It deserves negative infinity stars. One star is being WAY too nice.<br /><br />If you want good rap, I suggest Public Enemy, Nas, Beastie Boys, 2Pac (before he died), Notorious B.I.G. and that's all that can pop up in my head. For good rock music, get some Fear Factory, Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, American Head Charge, Lamb Of God, Bleeding Through, In Flames, As I Lay Dying, Darkest Hour, At The Gates, Himsa, Pantera and stuff like that. Even corporate rock (which sucks) is better than this P.O.S..
0345409671|4.0|I dont really have a lot to say. Most of what I have to say has already been said. I see that there's a review from Anne Rice here, although it could be bogus, I'm incined to believe it because I have no reason to not believe it. I too find it odd that people can think the Lestat giving Dora oral (God forbid my mom finds this review) is completely disconnected from the plot. And even if it was completely disconnected from the plot, I cant see how it can offend people so much. I certainly wasn't offended by it. <br />I think Anne Rice has some origional views on religion, and I found it all very interesting. The way she portrays the angels is incredible. I was actualy feeling guilty because I liked her portrayal of Memnoch more than God.
1563898586|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this trade paperback. Having all 6 issues in one book was much easier than trying to find the individual issues. And cheaper, too! <br /> <br />So, what do you do when there is trouble in Victorian times? Have Mina Murray gather up Alan Quartermain, Dr. Henry Jekyl, the Invisible Man and off you go. Great story. <br />
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I had just returned from Iraq when this movie came out. My friend invited me to see it, but I had no idea what it was about. This movie is so true on so many levels. The first five minutes of the movie was worth the whole admission price. Granted, there were a lot of scenes in the movie that were crude and obscene. The movie still would have been hilarious minus these scenes. So don't take your children to see this movie. But overall, it is a great movie. My sides heard for days from laughing so hard!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Sometimes I go and buy random CDs that I know nothing about.  I did that for this one and I was so pleased with my purchase.  This guy has got some pipes!  I love every song on the album and I may like the acoustic (stripped) version even more.  I hope to see more great music from this guy in the future.
0972169504|5.0|HI Jorge, <br />I finished your book in 45 mins after I tore open the shipment from amazon. The excitement was due to the fact that it talks abt us(hmmm, i'm a phd student myself!)and I wanted to know who well u portrayed it. And you did it damn well! Just one complaint!!! I thought the book would be thicker...stories of grad life are bigger...and bigger it gets,we'll like it even more! So plz don't stop writing. I know u'll graduate, but pass on to your colleagues who are still looking for the light at the end of the tunnel!
B000002U82|5.0|This album rules.  It's one of the first albums I ever bought, and I owe everything to it.  You just can't beat this.  David Gilmour can make the earth move with a single note.  There is no paralleling the absolute brilliance of this gem.  Pink Floyd rules you all with an iron fist.
B000929AJQ|4.0|<br /> Look at it this way: You had the classic debut (pretty hate machine), the E.P. (broken), the masterpiece (the downward spiral), the experimental album (the fragile), the live album (and all that could've been), and now the \\"grown up\\" album with trent reznor finding a more mature sound than on previous efforts.  <br /> No, With Teeth is not as heavy as anything made 12 years ago, and it shouldn't be. It's definitely more 'song-oriented' as they say and goes in the opposite direction of The Fragile, meaning simplicity instead of complexity, but it's definitely not a repeat of anything that trent reznor has done before. <br /> The new album is dancier and catchier than anything found in the back catalog, and dare I say, more content and sane.  <br /> Bottom Line: It's enjoyable to listen to and there's not one bad song. With Teeth is a great record, and yes, it becomes more enjoyable and more addictive with each listen, as with All NIN records. Buy it now if you're still a fan after 16 years, and if you're not into it, then sell it back so another fan can get a great record at a great price.  <br />
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I thought Dreamland was an incredible album.  Haunting songs, tight arrangements, I honestly thought it was Plant's best solo work.  It seemed rootsy and his vocals were perfect.<br /><br />MR is even better.  It rocks out more, is just as musically diverse, and sounds downright rejuvenating.  The rhythm section of this band is particularly strong.  It jams out at times.  The guitar work hasn't quite got the finger work of a early-career Jimmy Page (who does?) but comes across as more than competent and provides the songs with some great energy.<br /><br />You have to mention Mr. Plant's song writing ability. He could easily rest on the laurels of a mythical past, but what true artist does?  He's a true artist.<br /><br />Shine it all around and the title track are stand outs, but the whole album shines.
B000002TLX|5.0|One of my favorite singers of all time. Richard Marx took the industry by storm with his debut smash \\"Don't Mean Nothing\\" in 1987 and would be a fixture on top of the billboard charts for years to come.  <br /> <br />This CD has all of his biggest hits including the number 1's \\"Hold On To The Nights\\", \\"Satisfied\\" and \\"Right Here Waiting For You\\". The sound quality of the CD is amazing. Richard Marx is a real talent and a fantastic singer. No Richard Marx fan should be without this compilation. Don't think I can say anything else that hasn't been mentioned by other reviewers. 67 reviews and an overall 5 star rating. Guess that says it all!
B000002HPV|5.0|Bjork is strange, so is her husband, and so are her videos. But Homogenic is her best yet. Medulla is still good because it has \\"Who is it?\\" and it's all composed using voices instead of instruments, but I like Homogenic more and I have found that most people do.  <br /> <br />The highlights of the CD are, 'Joga', 'Hunter', 'All is full of Love'(I really like the lyrics for this one, and the light airy feel of it is quite, well, nice. I would say it is definalty worth the 15 bucks to shell out. It puts me in a good mood. <br /> <br />With Homogenic, not every other track is just a filler. That is also why it is good. Maybe go check out(download) some of Ben Gibbard's solo stuff. He does a lot of Bjork covers.
038533348X|5.0|This was a totaly entertaining book.  I think I first read it 15 years ago and I didn't pick up on the humor.  The stuff about religion is great. <br /> <br />I thought Breakfast was better, but this is still a great read.
6305428271|5.0|I love Dangerous Minds, but I do admit it could have been better...basically it was a great plot, the acting was good but they could have gone places with the movie..But overall, I loved it..Gangstas Paradise went SO well with the movie and gave a great sense of the setting..i recommend it, but not to all - especially the movie critic types..warning:this is not an oscar award winning movie
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Ironic how this first time filmmaker was majorily inspired by the work of Wes Anderson, it seems to be the very people who don't \\"get\\" Anderson's work that end up loving this film. <br /> <br />The dry comic tone is nice in the beginning, the problem is that NONE of tha characters are likable. Yes, Napoleon is a goofy kid who gets picked on alot...are we supposed to like him and identify with him because of that?? Or are we just supposed to laugh at him for being so nerdy? This movie never develops the main characters, we never see them happy! How can we root for a character if we have no idea what they want, where they're going, or what makes them happy??? <br /> <br />The jokes in this movie might work in a short film or a 3 minute comedy sketch, but drawn out over 90 minutes they just fail to work. <br /> <br />Rather than laugh AT the characters in this film, we should feel like we're rooting for them. Take a television series like \\"Freaks & Geeks\\" - it took geeky looking kids, revealed their hopes and dreams, and you end up identifying with them.  <br /> <br />In the end, this basically serves as a comedic film for meatheads to laugh at people different from them...and its ok, because the geeks in this film have no emotion and they're not like us! Shallow, superficial humor for shallow minds.
B000009ED0|4.0|This is not the beatles \\"white album\\" Its fun humor rock. Its a new category look for it a the record store. Anyways have a good time with it. Love it or leave it. But, take it for what its worth....sittin behind the garage smokin a blunt...If thats your deal you might enjoy this album. If you sit at a desk  pushing pens all day....stick with the elevator music..
B00005JMCN|5.0|I love movies. I love great stories. This movie is very special to me. I think this is one of the best stories ever told in a movie. The pure determination of the rider, Red, and the horse, Seabisuit, is just amazing. You will love this movie and so will everyone in the family. I know movies, I've made my own, they may not of been very good but who cares. This movie was fascintating and I loved it.
B000002U82|5.0|Thank you Pink Floyd, for giving us this brilliant album.  The world would not be the same without \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".  I am just in awe of its brilliance.  I listen to it every day.  Millions have been touched by this music, and millions more will follow.  Praise the Floyd.
B00005JLEX|5.0|The greatest thing about Seinfeld is that they are horrible people which makes it hillarious. I've seen just about every show they ever had. These DVDs are essential for the true Seinfeld fan. Even if you're not a fan, this would hook you. You will die laughing. My personal favorite characters are George and Kramer. They are so outrageous that you can't compare them. This is the greatest work of all time in comedy.
B000002U82|5.0|There is no reason not to buy this album.  It is unbelievably good.  Powerful good, even.  You can't believe it until you hear it.  It is just that good. <br /> <br />And remember, it is better to have people believe that you are a fool than to not buy this album and remove all doubt.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is one of their most famous albums ever. They have so many classics on this. Thay have one great after another. My favorite is \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", it's happy and gets me in the mood for the day.  <br /> <br />I've read alot about the Beatles and there was one person who I grew to not like very much. I somewhat don't like Paul McCartney because he tried to take control of the Beatles when they didn't want him to. He also was supposely the first to leave the band when everyone else already left secretly. I love all of the Beatles but that just made me upset. The good thing is that they stayed together long enough to make this album.  <br /> <br />All of the Beatles were very talented. John Lennon was my favorite. He wrote very powerful songs. They made you think. Next cam George Harrison who was not a very well known Beatle. He was a great guitar player and wrote some beautiful songs. After comes Ringo Star, he was funny and very enjoyable to watch. Last comes Paul McCartney who was very talented but didn't understand that the other Beatles didn't want him to do some of the things he did.  <br /> <br />You should buy this album because it shows how well they worked together before problems aroused. The world was better back then. The Beatles made life happy. You should get this album. It will make you wonder why some of them had to become pig headed and ruin the band. But we will always remember them because of this album and a few others.
B00062IVKS|5.0|I watched the movie the other day for the first time since I saw it on opening day in New York, with Jake La Motta in the audience in the front row.  At that time it seemed so strange to have a movie in black and white.  Woody Allen had released some black and white films, as had Peter Bogdanovich earlier in the 1970s, but for the most part, Hollywood was a slave to color, often in garish film processes that seemed to bleach out even as you watched them.<br /><br />The DVD addresses the reasons that Scorcese decided to go with black and white, but ultimately, a preference for color is one thing that modern audiences have made themselves clear about, and producers know that if they release a picture in b/w, they're cutting their box office take in half instantly, so it isn't a popular decision.  However for period pieces like this one, that harkens back so vividly to the 1940s and 1950s, b/w seems almost inevitable, indeed ideal, for as a way to blur the years and the distances between eras, once you take away the color you are left with the barren surfaces of things.<br /><br />Watching the 25th anniversary DVD for RAGING BULL directly after having seen the new feature SIN CITY, you can tell where Rodriguez got many of his ideas from, except that the blood spouting from his character's mouths after being belted would be blood red against the black and white ring action, and Cathy Moriarty's lips would be vivid scarlet, the trail of her lit cigarette a pale twisting blue.  Michael Chapman's photography has never been bettered (in RAGING BULL), and whoever designed the film's proletarian settings deserved the Oscar for the sheer creativity and enthusiasm with which so many gyms, bars, and New York tenements were re-created from out of old Weegee photos and the memories of so many involved with the underground worlds of boxing and the mob.<br /><br />When it first came out, some critics complained that Scorcese seemed to be playing up the story as some sort of American tragedy like Othello, when its basic design lacked any grand Shakespearean heights or depths, but in the passage of time you can see that with this film Scorcese was moving away from Shakespearean models into some sort of rough poetry all his own.American tragedy like Othello, when its basic design lacked any grand Shakespearean heights or depths, but in the passage of time you can see that with this film Scorcese was moving away from Shakespearean models into some sort of rough poetry all his own.
B000050HTO|5.0|I love the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Bob Dylan was around then. His music is powerful. The song \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" is masterful. I also love \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\". The songs are awesome. My father introduced me to Bob Dylan's music. I read about him and he was a fascinating man.  <br /> <br />I'm surprised that people haven't heard of Bob Dyaln, of course everyone now is listening to that brain numbing crap. This man was a true artist. He understood that he needed to be different. That's what singers now are missing. Years ago, artists were pure and wrote their own music. Today they buy it from song writers who write crap just to make a quick buck. I miss the pure music time. Buy this album because it'll show you true music.
B0007PAMBK|4.0|A somewhat amateurish production,but very moving in many ways. I have a feeling that some of our present day directors have seen this film and borrowed from it. For movie buffs only.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd are your masters and commanders.  No one can ever duplicate their musical magic.  This is brilliance beyond comparison.  Nothing has ever touched this, and nothing ever will.  \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is the greatest album of all time.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|As a viewer of last years scientific thriller \\"Constantine\\" I was filled with anticipation for each upcoming scene.  A powerful story staring Keanu Reeves as the title role bring the scenario of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" which resides around heaven and hell and Constantine's yearn to be accepted into heaven.  A perfect role for Keanu Reeves who nails the sense of humor for his role of Constantine. Rachel Wize (sp?) adds a great aura to the film of a Bonnie and Clyde relationship between the two characters.  I loved it, go see it, a great screenplay which makes you think about possibilities.
B00005JLEJ|4.0|At this point in Kurosawa's career, he's completed the vast majority of his work, excluding Ran and Dreams, and one might think he'd tire.  However, he chooses not too and puts this epic film on with the early vigor of his earlier films. <br /> <br />Kagemusha is set in 16th century Japan, where control can be easily won or lost, but is rarely held on to for long.  Yet, one emperor Shingen has managed to do so until his later years, only to be taken away by a sniper.  Yet Shingen was revered, and asked that his death be hidden to keep his people's morale up, and his enemies safely away.  This is a decent plan, but when the double starts feeling the conflictions of his new self and former the chances diminish.  Plus, enemies are ever threatening and questioning the truth, even family connections. <br /> <br />Sounds exciting, and for three hours it does have many fine moments, which I purport to be well worth the film.  Sure, the film is slow as many Kurosawa's can be, but this is part of Japanese culture anyways, and thus adds to the overall, although one might need to remind themselves of that fact. <br /> <br />For those not use to Kurosawa there's always the battle scenes, but the deeper conflicts is imbedded in the double (played by Tatsuya who also plays the emperor.)  This double once was a thief, and in a near prince and the pauper fashion rose up, or \\"acted\\" as if he was great. <br /> <br />Overall, I understand that many for good or bad reasons no longer feel the prevalence of Kurosawa's films, as I have trouble to do with some.  Still though, this one as recent and enduring as it is may still reach those yet, as the film is meant to.
B0000251W3|5.0|Not alot to say but a must for any iron maiden fan or any metal fan for that matter. Probably the most underrated cd maiden has released. It's title track is epic. One of my favorite songs ever and probably maidens most underrated song. The instrumental part at the end can't have been better. &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; is also a good song and has very interesting not very maiden lyrics. &quot;Can I Play With Madness&quot; is definitly the rocker of the bunch and probably the only song a regular maiden would've heard of on this cd. <BR>          DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE LACK OF HITS. Though it might not be the most popular album it is right up there with number of the beast which I might add is also definitly worth looking at.<BR>    A good buy.
B000002U82|5.0|This album is too fantastic.  Pink Floyd are one of the greatest bands to grace mankind.  If you like music, you will love this.  It is a soul-moving experience like no other.  Pink Floyd are one of the most important bands of all time, no question.  I recommend this album very very highly.  Buy it, and it will change your life, for the better.
0375507256|5.0|David Mitchell was interviewed by the great Margaret Throsby on Sydney radio when he came to town in February, 2005. She said the novel was like a palindrome in that you could read the chapters backwards. This very unusual literary device is used by the writer to stunning effect. Indeed, I was not too keen on some of the stories in the first half but loved them in the second. This is where the use of connection and coincidence come into play. Though their styles are different Mitchell reminds me of the early Paul Auster in his fascination with chance and fate. <br />I recommend this book highly but I think to really enjoy it you should read Mitchell's debut novel, Ghostwritten, first and don't skip it's epigraph - a quote from Thornton Wilder. A lot of clues to the puzzle that is Cloud Atlas are contained therein. Cloud Atlas can be read again and again to pick up the synchronicity which may affect all our lives. And it is a great and intriguing read.
0316779237|5.0|Brilliant!  Disturbing!  Deliciously short and appropriate for holiday evening reading.  Tuck this one in your travel bag when you go home for the holidays to use as an escape or distraction.  I don't want to give too much away, but the piece on working as an elf at Santaland should be familiar to public radio listeners, and it is hilarious.  The visciously biting review of an elementary school Christmas pageant, \\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" is another terrific read.<br /><br />This is a book to own and open up every holiday season to read the stories over again.  Pass it around the house.  It's a very quick read.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|First off, not for everyone. However, I found it to be hilarious. Maybe because I was able to relate to the main character somewhat. Some great one liners.
0316776963|5.0|This lay around my house in college and I assumed, from the cover and the title, that it was some textbook for my roommate's special education coursework.  I had no interest in it as a result.  How wrong I was!  I read the first chapter and it was so hilarious that I stole the book from her to finish in as few sittings as possible.<br /><br />Sedaris has a unique talent for taking the mundane, the average, even the tragic and twisting it up in his special way to make the reader laugh out loud.  I've given this book as a gift to many people, and they all have loved it and looked into Sedaris's other works.
B0006399FS|5.0|After giving it a few listenings, Ive come to the conclusion that this is another great U2 album. Everything that makes U2 great is on this album. At first I wanted more of album to be like Vertigo, but in the end, the variety has been nice. I do hope they get more rock back into their future albums though. All in all, its a must have album and one of the best of the year. Very consistant with U2 past albums.
B000063CMK|5.0|Remedy Lane was the album that converted me to Pain Of Salvation. And what an album it is! If you've read my review of One Hour By The Concrete Lake, you'll know that unlike many fans of the band, I don't consider them one of my all time favourites nor do I love everything they've done. However, Remedy Lane is one of my favourite albums of any genre, so I figure throwing in yet more praise for the band wouldn't do any harm.<br /><br />As you may or may not know, every one of Pain Of Salvation's albums is a concept of some sort. The basic concept of Remedy Lane is one of love and relationships and the pain of losing someone you love. I won't go into the entire story here, but the concepts of individual songs deal with rather grissley subjects such as the suicide of a loved one or the miscarraige of a child (the latter being based on a real life experience of vocalist/guitarist/chief songwriter Daniel Gildenlow). Of course, there are nicer subjects to be found - This Heart Of Mine is a gorgeous love ballad - but for the most part the album deals with darker and more painful side of an otherwise beautiful thing.<br /><br />Musically, the band rarely faulter. Experiments with odd rhythms and melodies are far more successful than on earlier albums, such as on Fandango and Rope Ends, and the album on the whole is very diverse, be it the uplifting melodies of This Heart Of Mine, Chain Sling and Dyrad Of The Woods, the prog metal of Rope Ends and Trace Of Blood, the omnious darkness of Ending Theme and Undertow or the sheer grandeur of Beyond The Pale.<br /><br />Then of course we have the band themselves. Daniel Gildenlow is the mastermind here. The man's voice is simply incredible. His passion is intense and his technical ability is beyond impressive. But most of all is his creativity. The majority of this album was written exclusively by him. Its incredible to imagine that this huge, complex and incredibly epic album was the product of one man's mind. The rest of the band compliment him perfectly but lets not beat around the bush here: intentionally or otherwise, Gildenlow is the star of the show.<br /><br />How to sum up this review? Well... if you want truly original music that proves that complexity can be passionate and that metal can be progressive, it is simply essential. Get it and get it now.he band compliment him perfectly but lets not beat around the bush here: intentionally or otherwise, Gildenlow is the star of the show. <br /> <br />How to sum up this review?

0312965788|4.0|All Creatures Great and Small is a heartfelt story about James Herriot, a local English veterinarian, and his adventures of being a vet.<br /><br /> Herriot begins his novel by talking about himself and what he does as a vet, \\"If you decide to become a veterinary surgeon you will never grow rich but you will have a life of endless interest and variety.\\" He says. He uses flashbacks from college to relate to his work, \\"The old chap certainly wasn't kidding. Variety. That it was- variety.\\" Herriot says, referring to his college professor.  Herriot also describes his \\"love of life\\" in the nonfiction novel.  James Herriot shares stories about his friends' pet pig or a dog he is caring for, during the period of time he needs for surgeries. He also comes across small problems, such as, cows with milk fever and a horse having difficulty getting up off the ground.<br /><br /> When I first began reading All Creatures Great and Small, I didn't know if I would finish the novel because of the amount of pages and chapters, but as I reached Chapter five, I was hooked because of his enchanting and joyful tone.<br /><br /> Don't let the number of pages fool you; if you love animals or are interested in becoming a veterinarian, this is such a great and loving novel to read.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Scads of you have already done, but I would be failing in my duties as a fan if I didn't review this album, so I will; confidentially, I've had the album for about a month (yes, I'm very sure, and no, I'm not lying), so I've formed quite the opinion in that time.  I'm also going to do a track-by-track, because... <br /> <br />OVERALL_1: ...this album has no central theme.  Both DS and The Fragile (hell, even \\"Still\\") seemed to have a very specific direction, an aura, a general feeling... but With Teeth is more of a \\"random stuff on the radio\\" offering; just a bunch of songs that sound good independently, but don't have much to do with each other.  Therefore, it's impossible to review the album as a whole, unless you're going to generalize and say \\"it r good\\" or \\"OMG SUX\\". <br /> <br />ALL THE LOVE IN THE WORLD:  Great way to kick off the album.  The beat in the first half of the song is one of the most memorable Trent's ever created, the bass gives it a \\"groovy\\" feeling for lack of a better word, and there's some very inventive vocal arrangements.  You'll be singing along with it for weeks. <br /> <br />YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?:  This track is the reason I can't give the album five stars. It's crap. My thinking is that Trent was going to put \\"Home\\" here, then realized his album was too quiet and threw this one together to give it some more \\"OOMPH\\".  No, it's not the worst song of all time, but it's pretty worthless.  I do kinda like the subdued bridge, though. <br /> <br />THE COLLECTOR:  At first I dismissed this one completely, but after a few listens it really grew on me.  The offbeat beat (heh) is what makes it stand out... as well as Trent's trademarked \\"drunken coke-fiend on the piano\\" thing that he does every now and again.  If you want to satisfy your need for something heavy, I'd turn to this instead of \\"U Kno Wat U R?!1\\" <br /> <br />THE HAND THAT FEEDS:  The poppy beat/riff combo that never gets old.  Upbeat and danceish, yet enough power and acidity to keep Ashlee Simpson from trying to cover it.  Solid lyrics that are well-executed.  This was a single for a reason. <br /> <br />LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH:  This song is not enough.  It falls a bit short, and while I believe if Trent had worked a little harder on it this track would shine, he didn't, and therefore it's simply decent. <br /> <br />EVERY DAY IS EXACTLY THE SAME:  A good slow-grind that reminds me a lot of Fragile-era offerings; gets your neck moving a little.  Really love the words to this one.  Also, I think the piano is used quite well here. <br /> <br />WITH TEETH:  Okay, so... this thing.  I'm not really sure what to think of it, even after all this time.  I do know Trent yelling \\"uh-WITH-uh TEE-THUH\\" is ridiculous, but other than that, it's not bad, I guess... BUT.  There is a quiet part in the middle that's extremely beautiful, and it's the only thing that makes this song noteworthy.  I must stress that it's QUIET: that is, you'll literally have to crank the volume to hear it at all... and if you don't want to die of a heart attack when it suddenly becomes loud again, turn it back down at 4:18. <br /> <br />ONLY:  This is how Trent Reznor tells the world a joke without their realizing it.  While it's a great song with a beat that you can't sit still during, it's supposed to carry a tinge of humour!  Sing along and LAUGH!  If you're not laughing by the time you hear the second verse, you don't get it... maybe you just had to be there? <br /> <br />GETTING SMALLER:  Trent is still trying to make us laugh on this track with the single line, \\"I got my arms that FLIP FLOP FLIP FLOP FLIP!\\"  Other than that, this is a good, fast song... and it has a style I would never have expected from NIN.  I attribute that to the presence of Dave Grohl. <br /> <br />SUNSPOTS:  The bass reigns in this song.  That strange synth does have its moment in the spotlight, but not much of one.  It's another slow-grind (even slower grind this time), and even Trent's vocals - despite how good they are - seem to take a back seat to the bass.  Bass, bass, bass. <br /> <br />THE LINE BEGINS TO BLUR:  Loud, searing dissonance.  The verses with their canned vocals are mostly there to see if you'll stab your Discman with a dull letter opener while listening to them... but the chorus is extremely well done... slow power and beauty. <br /> <br />BESIDE YOU IN TIME:  Wow.  Well, you've got this semi-interesting repetetive \\"vvVD vvVD\\" thing going on for most of the song... but it builds you up for the climax, which can only be described as \\"majestic\\" or \\"godly\\".  Everything comes together just the right way, and you can feel yourself ascending.  Nice little track. <br /> <br />RIGHT WHERE IT BELONGS:  A sad piano, slightly jazz-influenced, with a low, pulsating synth to help it along.  No drums.  Stellar lyrics.  Trent's singing has a \\"tape recorder muffle\\" for the greater portion of the track, but at just the right moment, he's suddenly crystal clear.  Solid ending. <br /> <br />OVERALL_2:  Worth the money.  Not his greatest album of all time, but it's worth every penny.
0743454529|5.0|Saw this book on the shelf of my college book store and the title along with the picture caught my attention read the back cover and thought ok ill give it a try.  Well to my surprise i was hooked the minute i started reading it.  Being a mother and a daughter myself i was able to place myself in each of these peoples shoes.  The way the author goes into great detail about the strugles and fraustration that each character went through is great you actually feel like your the one in that situation.  I found myself wondering would i be able to make the decisions that these people made?  I was able to laugh be angry and cry with this book and that is only possible if you are able to become part of these people in which i did.  I have just found myself a new favorite author i intend to read more of her books and i recommend this one to anyone you wont be disappointed you will find yourself shedding tears to the bitter end.
B000929AJQ|1.0|I thought Nine Inch Nails was a band that had an edge to their sound, something that made you sit up and listen. <br />Not anymore, forget this and get \\"Downward Spiral\\" and \\"The Fragile\\" <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|Why do people insist on giving one of the greatest trilogies of all time 1 star because they don't like the fact it has added special effects and a few minor cosmetic changes done BY THE CREATOR!!!! It's not like some random man ran up and changed the movies these were done by George Lucas himself and they look great. I can't blame George for making these changes being he didn't have the special effects to make his vision a reality in the 70's. George wants to leave behind a Star Wars that visually will stand up to the test of time. So stop crying please these movies tell the same story and have the same themes and characters as the originals. If you care about a few visual changes don't buy these DVD's so you can spare the world from your winning.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This album is by far thw worst thing they have ever done, everything they did was acceptable and pretty much fantastic until this pile of rubbish came along. <br /> <br />Thye are completely washed up, just goes to show people will buy anything thats in the charts.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Certainly, the medium of film can afford more depth and background than a stage production. I think Joel Schumacher's film is fine on many levels, especially his sense of period detail. The sets & costumes were magnificent. Also magnificent is the lovely Emmy Rossum (I remember her lovely performance in a little indie called \\"Songcatcher\\"). The rest of the cast was fine. The finest moment has to be Rossum's \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\", alone in the graveyard, one of the only really peaceful moments. Gerard Butler was fine, and Patrick Wilson sang beautifully. One thing that often bothers me in films like this is why some characters speak with accents (Minnie Driver) and most of the others don't. (\\"Evita\\" had the same problem; even on stage, the character of Juan Peron always had an accent.) Doesn't make sense to me. All the other reviewers have gone into plot, and stage comparisons. I won't do that, mostly because, alas, I never saw it on stage. But this is not the stage production...it's a FILM, and, as such, I was very impressed and enjoyed it a lot.
B00018D44U|4.0|\\"Feels like Home\\" is a great choice if you're looking for more of the same from Norah Jones, but with a twist. It follows the same formula that Norah incorporated on 'Come Away with me', but is infused with more a jazz-meets-country vibe that can take some getting used to. Its not as sunny as first single 'Sunrise' might imply. Some of the themes are darker and the vocals are more hushed and plaintive than the debut record, but it is still as effective as ever. That said, its easy to see why this album hasn't been as much of a runaway success as 'Come away with me'. I attribute it in part to the song choices - Norah could certainly have used some richer material for her sophomore effort - and some tracks sound like weak replays of the slower tracks on the debut CD, which may give the listener the feeling that buying one album by the artist is enough. Some have called this album an unnecessary sequel. Thats rather unfair considering the artistic merit of the recordings here, but its easy to see why.<br /><br />Norahs' vocals have certainly improved, though the sparse arrangements could have been enhanced a little more this time around. Its ironic that Dolly Parton guest stars on this record. In fact, 'Feels like Home' feels very much like when Dolly Parton made her foray from country music into bluegrass territory (most notably on 'The Grass is Blue'). Thats because its very telling that with this work, Norah has moved from the jazz scenario to the country-western stage (duets with Willie Nelson only add to this notion), and many songs here would fit perfectly on a Lee Ann Womack catalog. Thats not a bad thing, but for those of us who approach this CD expecting more of that Billie Holiday vibe, we might want to reconstruct our approach. I think Norah doing country is fine, and shes mighty good at it, especially on tracks such as 'Humble Me' which to me is out and out country. Her duet with Dolly Parton, 'Creepin' In' is a lovely melody - a fusion between world music, country and jazz. All of this works in the nicest possible way, but that might just be the problem. I don't see the artist stretching herself to explore her own outer limits. Rather, the album seems like another exercise in reconfirming the theory 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. I wonder what the third album will sound like.<br /><br />Looking back upon artists who had a great debut album, such as Alanis Morissette, one can say with certainty that the freshness and uniqueness of that 'first sound' can never be replicated. But Norah does a pretty good job here. If you're into jazz music, or are even a casual listener to the works of Diana Krall or Nina Simone, chances are that you will love this CD. But in case you're a country music lover whos just beginning to explore new territory, this is a nice new place to start. For fans of Jones, this album only confirms that she is very much a master of her art, as well all suspected. While 'Feels like Home' doesn't really break new ground in terms of the artists' growth sonically, it is a testament to the fact that she is a bright light in our music industry, and has carved a niche for herself, and a genre, that is all her own. Buy this just for that, and you'll love it.<br /><br />kabitat@gmail.comsic, country and jazz. All of this works in the nicest possible way, but that might just be the problem.

B0006Z2KX4|5.0|This is perhaps the screwiest of the '30s screwball comedies, 100 minutes of sheer nonsense - and fun. Cary Grant is a paleontologist who needs one more bone to complete a dinosaur skeleton; he runs into Katherine Hepburn, an heiress, who owns a dog named George and a leopard named Baby. George steals the bone, Baby gets loose, and everyone ends up in a rural Connecticut jail, among other things. In the end the bone is recovered, but the skeleton collapses; of course Grant and Hepburn are left with each other. Almost nothing in the movie is connected with reality, and although it's not the funniest movie ever made, it's among the zaniest. Definitely worth a watch.
B000063TDY|5.0|I don't get the negative reviews regarding this album.  It's a throwback to the early 80's when Saxon ruled the world ... Strong Arm of the Law, Crusader, Denim and Leather ... Solid Ball has THAT Saxon sound.  If you want darker and heavier/moody stuff, then yeah go take a listen to Dogs of War or Unleash the Beast, but that ain't Saxon.  Biffs voice, which is the best part of Saxons sound, is really strong on this album.  Just listen to the little soundbites provided ... if you like what you hear, you'll dig this album
B000929AJQ|4.0|First off, who is NIN when living in the <br />21st century? <br />They would be my favorite band of all time if it <br />wasn't for the fact that they only release an album <br />every 5 to 6 years. So, What's the problem Trent? <br /> <br />Closer is probably the best \\"pop\\" song of all time. But,  <br />upon reflection NIN has never had a \\"stong\\" album as a whole. <br />The Downward Spiral was pretty good, but it was the Remix version of it that \\"took my breath away\\".  <br /> <br />How does \\"With Teeth\\" compare? Well, honestly, after listening to the first 5 tracks I was quite disappointed. There are no date rape songs like \\"March of the Pigs\\". The first track and the single \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" are good, but not great. <br />Songs 2,3 and 5 are fillers, so I thought to myself, NIN are <br />essentially dead in the 21st century, just like the Rolling Stones and other oldie bands that exist for no good reason. <br /> <br />But something good happened!!! Songs 6 through 13!!! <br />One of the best new songs from all genres (and all time) is \\"Every Day is Exactly The Same\\". (How true!!!) Beginning here is where I discovered that NIN are still brilliant, and I had to listen to this repeatedly.  <br /> <br />I find that I can compare some of these songs to past NIN efforts. \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" reminds me of \\"Hurt\\" but better. \\"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\\" reminds me of the brilliant song \\"Piggy\\". \\"Getting Smaller\\" reminds me of \\"Star*uckers\\", etc.  <br /> <br />Although the \\"Hand that Feeds\\" is the single, it certainly is not the best of.... I like it, but it is much more commercial and user friendly. \\"Beside You in Time\\" is excellent too. It reminds me of something like Nitzer Ebb, but I can't put my finger on it. It kind of has a minimalist approach (not many instruments), but ends up being intense, especially at the end of the song. (Which is typical of a NIN song) <br /> <br />So, when is the next NIN CD to be? 2011? I hope Trent keeps on trucking, becausehe has so much talent. I believe that as a pianist that writes most of his work in a minor key, he has a lot to offer in modern music to keep it from being dull. I pray to Satan that he doesn't give up. <br />
B0002RNXNM|3.0|I've been wanting this cd for some time now but didn't want to deal with the copy protection stiff the record company was nice enough to impose.  I saw that Amazon didn't label this import version as copy protected, so I thought it might be worth a try.  This is NOT the case.  This cd is copy protected just like the American version.  I don't know if there is a direct connection, but the sound quality on this cd sounds a bit muffled as well.  Kasabian should be distraught over this sleazy attempt to make money.  <br /> <br />The music on this cd isn't bad, but please don't support this ridiculous ball and chain technology the record company is pushing.  They are just going to keep adding it to cds in the future if people buy them. <br /> <br />That's my two cents.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Trent Reznor has been known to make you stop, shut up, and listen.  This has been evident since 1992 when the fantastic EP \\"Broken\\" was released.  His use of punctuated noise over catchy melodies was original for it's time, and broke into the mainstream.  Spawning off and inspiring copy-cat bands like Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Stabbing Westward, Gravity Kills, and numerous others.   <br /> <br />But before all that, he released Pretty Hate Machine.  His debut record is always a fan favorite to this day, yet it was left behind in many people's minds as a possiblity of sound.  With Teeth not only embraces the Pretty Hate Machine sound and style, but it updates and personalizes it even more.   <br /> <br />This record is not a sonic masterpiece (The Fragile).  This record is not an \\"ugly\\" (a fantastic ugly) concept album (The Downward Spiral).  Instead, we get a collection of stripped down, basic songs with pop hooks and that Nine Inch Nails kind of \\"heavy\\" we've come to love. <br /> <br />It's Trent Reznor playing the mainstream game.  He's not punching you in the face, he's punching the thousands of imitators in the face reminding them who does it best. <br /> <br />Buy this.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Britney Spears is quite simply the biggest star in the world over the recent years and on listen to this album shows why - the music. From fun dancey pop to ballads this album has plenty of mix.  <br />This Greatest Hit's CD is only the start of this young singers career. <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

0066620996|2.0|Before you read this, know that I'm biased. I've lived too long, read too many books and article and experienced too much in business. Any time I read that someone has the answer for all companies, I cringe. If there is anything I've learned in business is that every business is different. In business solutions, one size does not fit all. Whenever someone says that they have a simple answer for business, I recoil. Another thing I've learned is that business is a complex problem. And, complex problems deserve being respected for their complexity. Solutions to complex problems may be elegant, but they are rarely simple.<br /><br />In addition to the above, my problem with this book is its premise and research methodology. The basis of all the work that went into this book is the \\"Ratio of Cumulative Stock Returns to General Market\\". While this is certainly an important variable, it is not the complete measure of a company's greatness. It may or may not even be an indicator.<br /><br />First, stockholders are only one of the many stakeholders that a company has. As an extreme example, consider a fast growing, highly profitable company that's raping the environment. A great company must have a positive economic impact on its customers and honor the trust that a customer places in the company by purchasing goods and services. A great company must respect the individuals its employees, its suppliers and its strategic partners. A great company must also balance its financial performance in stock market with the development of its people, technology, industry and country. And, among many other things, a great company must be ethical and honor the trust given to them by the people in allowing them to incorporate.<br /><br />Lastly, I have a problem with any book about great companies that does not deal with innovation and creativity. Many of the examples described are innovations; it just doesn't call them that. The book seems to studiously avoid the use of creativity, strategy and innovation as those words were forbidden.<br /><br />The chapters in the book include:<br /><br />Good is the Enemy of Great<br /><br />Level 5 Leadership<br /><br />First Who...The What<br /><br />Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith)<br /><br />The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within Three Circles)<br /><br />A Culture of Discipline<br /><br />Technology Accelerators<br /><br />The Flywheel and the Doom Loop<br /><br />From Good to great to built to Last<br /><br />The book is written well and easy to understand. It was designed that way. Millions of copies have been sold, so maybe I'm wrong. I have been a time or two in my life. But, I did have problems with The Search for Excellence.

B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I agree with most of the reviewers here that this is the finest solo release of Robert's career. I did really like dreamland, so I knew I would also like rearranger, but holy smokes, this is a sonic assault on the senses. There is not a bad track on this record. From sonic bombast (and I do mean BOMBAST) to psychadelic instumental breaks, this record has everything. Congrats to Mr. Plant for not resting on his laurels,but challenging his audience...ala. Neil Young. Also this is a great sound mix on this disc. It feels like the music is jumping out of the speakers at you.Best release of the year, hands down. Go buy it. You will not be dissapointed.
0060763280|5.0|It may be difficult to accept the messenger, but I appreciated the message in this book.  Absent an inheritance from a rich uncle, I just don't think it is possible to be a success in any endeavor unless you develop your mindset in a manner similiar to that advocated here.  This book teaches workable techniques to allow you to rein in your thought processes.  Some of the techniques are based upon affirmations/declarations and some are based upon goal setting and visualization, but the bottom line is that your ACTIONS have to follow your thoughts.  This book can give you the means to translate thought into action.  It is easy to read, but sometimes hyperbolic.  If you can get past the hyperbole, you'll find many useful gems.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Basicly, it IS the best album. I mean you can't stop listening to it. I'm serious here. I bought this album 2 years ago, right on the release date because I was sooooooo sure that it's gonna be amazing and I was right. The album has all amazing tracks. Britney have been working on it for 2 years. She really does it damn well. I don't have a fav song of it because they are all my favourites. This album is a must-have for all pop music listeners. And I'm NOT saying that: \\"Buy it because it's Britney\\". I'm serious. This album is worth your money. I bought this and I bought it again on DualDisc because I love it soo much. I wasn't a huge Britney fan before until this album came out. This album is definately the best album ever existing. Here is the full tracklisting and I'm not gonna rate them 1 by 1 because I'm giving all of them 10/10!!<br /><br />1. Me Against The Music - Dance of the album, 1st single<br /><br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom - Hip-Hop/Club Dance, was supposed to be a single*<br /><br />3. Showdown - relaxing, funky<br /><br />4. Breathe On Me - Sexiest song on the album. Was also supposed to be a single*<br /><br />5. Early Mornin - Really relaxing and the lyrics are awsome. Produced by Moby<br /><br />6. Toxic - Her best song in millions opinion. Another dance song! 2nd single<br /><br />7. Outrageous - INDIA! A GREAT dance song! Produced by R. Kelly and was 4th single of the album**<br /><br />8. Touch Of My Hand - The melody is soo amazing. There's soo much details. I love it! The lyrics also wwonderful!<br /><br />9. The Hook Up - Another dance song and is fav song of every fan! Everyone says this should've been a single.<br /><br />10. Shadow - REALLY NICE ballad. Really great sounds and even my mom (44 yrs old)loves it.<br /><br />11. Brave New Girl - Sounds like 1999-2000 songs. This is a dance song and has a really great sound.<br /><br />12. Everytime - Britney wrote this song with 1 girl. It's soo great! Ballad! It's about her breakup with her ex Justin Timberlake and it's telling the truth! 3rd single!<br /><br />13. Me Against The Music (Remix) Really great indian style remix of the song. The same remix she performed at 2003 AMA's and on her tour.<br /><br />I'm tellin' you honestly. This album is worth buying.<br /><br />And some peoples said stuffs about that she can't sing and that the album is not good... It's not true! Their music style is not POP, that's why they don't like this album.<br /><br />This album is the best! Get it!<br /><br />* Britney didn't release these songs as singles because she accidently injured her knee while shooting a video for \\"Outrageous\\". She had to cancel her world tour.<br /><br />** This song didn't have a video going with it because she injured her knee while shooting a vid for it.

B000929AJQ|5.0|Fans waited a long time for new material from Trent Reznor, so was it worth it? The answer is definately yes. This album is not as good as The Downward Spiral or Prety Hate Machine, but it is still the best out there right now. All of these people complaining and rating it 1-2 stars are musically challenged. While this album is a far less aggresive approach, it still remains everything you could want from Trent. <br /> <br />To open the album is \\"All The Love in the World\\" which reminds me so much of Pretty Hate Machine style NIN. From there are more great songs like The Collector, The Hand That Feeds, the EXCELLENT Everyday Is Exactly the Same, Only and Getting Smaller. Those are only the tracks that stood out to me, but every time I listen to it it gets better. \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" closes out the album on a high note that reminded me somewhat of \\"Hurt\\" from The Downward Spiral.  <br /> <br />It is great stuff. It is still the NIN you remember from the 90's, just a little more mature. The songs are actually more song-oriented unlike the frantic earlier efforts, and even if that doesn't sound appealing to you, give this album a chance to grow on you. It isn't the best album ever, but I think it is the best release of 2005 so far.
B000021YQV|5.0|after five awesome years of owning toxicity i still consider this to be one of my favorite cds. i also find that other people who usually cant stand metal/hard rock have enjoyed alot of the songs on this cd, especially songs like \\"bounce\\" and \\"prison song\\" which are very fun and catchy. If you listen to the radio you have probably already heard some of the best songs on this album like: \\"Needles\\", \\"chop suey\\", \\"toxicity\\", and \\"aerials\\" which are all very good. Toxicity as a whole is very easy to listen thru entirely without really getting bored. and unlike the radio version of aerials the cd version has a 1:30 ending of indian chanting with flute which is kind of wierd... but interesting! so before buying any other s.o.a.d. cds i highly sugest toxicity first. its the most original, most enjoyable, and most unique metal album i have ever heard.
0790733226|5.0|This film really makes you think about what would happen if this story were to come true. The film is touching and Jodie Foster performs perfectly.  <br /> <br />Well worth the add to any DVD collection!
B00005MP58|5.0|I received this in the mail on Tuesday and watched it that night.  I stayed up until 3:30 am to finish it even though I had to get up to go to work the next day.  It is truly wonderful and a must see for fans of the book.  The five + hours flew by!
0684803356|3.0|I have to admit that the only reason I read this book was because I had heard good things about Ernest Hemmingway and was looking to discover some of his work.  Much to my chagrin, however, For Whom The Bell Tolls came up somewhat short of a satisfying read.  One of the biggest problems with this novel is that it is a five hundered word novel that could easily be written in a modest one-hundered and fifty: only a couple of days go by throughout the duration of the novel.  Another flaw I found in Hemmingway's For Whom The Bell Tolls is the trivialness behind the main character's job and even personality.  For five hundred pages the reader is forced to read about a simple man who has the simple job of traveling from America to Spain to blow up a specific bridge when given the order.  In the mean time, the main character, Robert Jordan, lollygags around in the woods with a few other Spanish rebels whose sanity/motivation becomes a bit doubtful.  In the end, Robert Jordan ends up dying under a dead horse opposing enemy fire.  Although I was hoping to recognize some of the insight behind this \\"timeless\\" classic or its author, I was disappointed as I found For Whom The Bell Tolls to be nothing less than an average novel written in an average style.  I reccomend reading The Sun Also Rises if you're looking for a fulfilling introduction to Hemmingway's work.
B00025ETIW|4.0|First off, let me just start out by saying that I have never really been into the whole punk/emo alternative style of music. But I do listen to all forms of music and feel that music is a human beings only true escape from the melancholoy world that we live in. <br /> <br />With that being said, you might ask yourself, \\"If we live in such a melancholoy world, why would I want to listen to an album that also portrays said melancholoy?\\" Simple, it is an escape. <br /> <br />I first saw this band a couple of weeks ago on MTV 2. I was thinking I was watching a video for The Used since I thought for certain that it was the lead singer since to me, they both sound alike. It was to my surprise that it was MCR. The video was for Helena. I was kinda of surprised because it was really catchy. Then later that evening as I was getting ready for work, I saw it again. It was then that the song stuck in my head and it almost brought tears to my eyes. I KNEW that this was a must have for me. It sealed the deal when I heard the song during the ending credits for House of Wax and I knew I was going to pick it up on payday. <br /> <br />Payday arrived and I headed to Best Buy and picked it up. I must have listened to the entire cd at least 4 times throughout work that night. From start to finish, the album just wowed me. Not since Evanescence have I been completely floored and just filled with sorrow, happiness and pain all in one.  <br /> <br />Like I said before, I have a hard time with listening to goth-type music. If you can really call it that. I do have an affectionatte place in my heart for females with vocal power and the looks when they are dressed in black. I think that is why I started to like this band. Now I know what you're thinking. The guy isn't female and it sounds like I'm in love with the guy. I'm not. I was just greatly impressed with the verocity of this album. <br /> <br />Alas, the only reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 is because it sounds almost the same as every other emo/punk alternative band out there. I think the lead singer has range and shows it in songs like Helena and I'm Not Okay but he sounds exactly like the guy from The Used. It still sounds good, but it sounds like stuff I have heard before. <br /> <br />This album has changed my opinion slightly and I will be picking up there prior album in a few weeks. I can tell you that this song will go with the small stack that never leave my car. This has just been bumped up to \\"Car\\" status instead of \\"House\\" status. I do recommend this album to others and even those that might seem taken aback by the look and sound. Give it a try. You never know, it might surprise you like it did me.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Alright, I'll go ahead and say that I'm not gonna start this off by saying that I have been a fan of NIN for a long time and then totally bash this album. Truthfully I've been a fan for about 6 months now(give or take 2 months) and I have found that NIN is possibly one of the greatest bands ever. When you think of Trent's creativity, you can think of few others who are even on his level(if any). <br />With that said, let's get to tha new release, \\"With Teeth\\". At first when I bought this album, I thought \\"this is good but it's not their best, by far\\". I have had that cd in my player for maybe 6 days now and I have found it very hard to hit the eject button. Everytime I listen to this album, I hear something new, something I never noticed before. This is the NIN album I have been waiting for. It's not to \\"out there\\" and it's not too cheesy. I actually was somewhat bummed on tha fact that there weren't any instrumentals on this album but I quickly got over it. I read from some other reviews that some think that the songs don't \\"flow together\\" and I must say that on several occasions I had no idea that tha song had changed until I glanced at my cd player. This is in my opinion(and solely mine), but I would say this maybe is one of NIN's best releases. It doesn't have the same feel as The Fragile and The Downward Spiral(which is a good thing). Honestly I cannot say that I have encountered a full release by NIN that I have not enjoyed(and no \\"Further Down The Spiral\\" doesn't count). I have to say that before you go and rant and rave about how disappointed you are in Trent in not putting effort in this album, you should really give it several complete listens through with no skipping and no skimming. Then you can truly tell us if this is up to par with your taste. <br /> <br />All The Love In The World:9/10 <br />You Know What You Are:10/10 <br />The Collector:9/10 <br />The Hand That Feeds:10/10 <br />Love Is Not Enough:9/10 <br />Every Day Is Exactly The Same:11/10 <br/>With Teeth:9/10 <br />Only:10/10 <br />Getting Smaller:11/10 <br />Sunspots:10/10 <br />The Line Begins To Blur:10/10 <br />Beside You In Time:10/10 <br />Right Where It Belongs:10/10 <br /> <br />There's a chart of how I rate the songs(also in my opinion). I hope this helps you in deciding if you should buy this album or not, and if not, just listen to tha songs up at tha track listing above and then you can decide for yourself and you wont have to depend on losers like me to help you determine if you like this or not. <br />Have A Nice Day...
0060763280|2.0|I wanted to believe - in Harv Eker - I really did.  I have read many books on wealth building and self-improvement, and I have been very successful by following the principles taught by authors such as Brian Tracy, Tony Robbins, Napolean Hill, and Robert Kiyosaki, among others.  I have applied their principles and found that they work.  But these other authors provide something that Mr. Eker does not - substance.  <br /> <br />The first 187 pages of this book are filled with shallow generalities and soundbites such as: \\"Rich people are bigger than their problems.  Poor people are smaller than their problems.\\"  I don't disagree, but there is nothing to back up these simple \\"wealth principles\\" and little in the way of direction for implementation. <br /> <br />Still, this book could be an adequate primer for those who have had no introduction to the genres of wealth-building and self-improvement -- except for the continual pleadings to visit the author's website and attend his seminars.  Yes, I know that authors in many fields often write books as a means to promote themselves and their other products, but I have never seen a book, other than giveaway promotionals, that so blatantly pushed the author's other products while providing so little in return.  Like an infomercial, this book continually tells you what you could experience if you would only attend his seminar.  And all those website freebies promised throughout the book? You must give him your name and e-mail address before he'll let you in.  And after you do that, you must provide a credit card and pay a $100 deposit for that free seminar. <br /> <br />I'm returning my book tomorrow and getting my money back.  For the same amount of money you can get BOTH \\"Maximum Achievement\\" (Brian Tracy) AND \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" (Napolean Hill).  Neither is an infomercial in disguise. <br /> <br />Oh, and what comes after those first 187 pages of fluff?  A five-page invitation to visit the registration-required website and attend the credit card-required seminar, a four-page advertorial for the same seminar (still no mention of a credit card here), a two-page lecture to \\"share the wealth\\" by committing to tell at least one hundred people about the book (or buy the book for them!), and a four-page list of seminars, home learning programs, and instructions on how you can hire Harv to speak at your own event. <br /> <br />Come on, Harv - I don't fault you for building your own wealth through seminars, CDs and speaking engagements, but please don't charge us $20 for your catalog.  Give us something we can use!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is awesome! Ive never seen the musical befor because I never wanted to because I thought that musicals were boring and another reason is, is that Im only 15 so I cant drive myself to them and noone in my family likes musicals so Ive never seen one. But like I said befor, this movie is awesome! The Phantom is so sexy! All through-out the movie I was like 'Why is Christine picking pretty-boy Raoul over the sexy and mysterious Phantom?!?! I have no clue why she did.. maybe it was because part of his face was deformed? Well he wore a mask all the time and covered it up so I couldve lived with it because the part that wasnt all nasty was SEXY!! Most of my friends thought so to! And Emmy Rossum had an amazing voice! I heard Sarah Brightmans voice befor and to me, she sounds like an old grand-ma singing in a chroir! I like the way Emmy Rossum sings better! Her voice is so smooth. Its just so young and innocent but at the same time mature and seductive! All in all, I choose Emmy Rossum over Sarah Brightman all the way! All the characters in this movie act very well. I can see why this movie was #1 for so long! Raoul was a terrific actor and a wonderful singer but I wish that the phantom would have got the girl instead of him because its just so sad that the phantom has to be all alone his whole life now while Raoul would have had another chance at love while the phantom has to stay in the dungeon until the day he dies all alone never fully experiencing what its like to truly love and be loved back!! It made me cry!! And to me, the phantom was WAY more sexier than Raoul!!! And to all of you people who say that this movie sucks then you just dont know what a good movie really is! This movie is defiantly on my favorite movie list! Well this movie is defiantly a great buy! You should at least rent it if you dont want to buy it because its one of the greatest movies ever! So go ahead, buy it! I garuntee you that you will love it!
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I will say right now I am not a big fan of musicals.  This will either give me more credibility since I'm not reviewing this film as a diehard \\"Phan\\" or it will kill my credibility with those who choose to constantly compare it to the Broadway musical. <br /> <br />Now for the review... <br /> <br />Overall, I had to take one star away for the vocal problems apparent here and there in the film.  Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson all showed an amazing amount of guts to take on the roles so associated with the original cast.  And for the most part, their performances were moving.  I won't lie, I shed tears at the end of the film, I was so touched by the emotion, passion, and feeling in the performances.  The beginning of the film... I had shivers.  Simply put, an excellent job by these actors. <br /> <br />However, as I said, there were some problems.  Both Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler seem to have problems with the full vocal range associated with opera.  I noticed both on the soundtrack and in the film that they struggled to hit or hold some of the notes, and it was very obvious, especially during the \\"signature\\" song of the production, that the music was being used to cover up the vocal imperfections of these two.  When the two sang \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", it was clear that they sadly were not comfortable or able to handle to vocal range necessary to make these songs work on all levels.  They simply lacked the vocal power. <br /> <br />Despite that, most of their performances were excellent as I noted above.  I was very much impressed by the sets, the cast, and the costumes, with the notable exception of Ms. Rossum's costume during \\"Phantom of the Opera\\"/\\"Music of the Night\\".  The negligee was a bit too much (or too little as the case may be).  I can only wonder why Ms. Driver was not given the opportunity to sing as Carlotta and was dubbed?  I can only guess, based on her performance of \\"Learn to Be Lonely\\", that she was simply unable to pull off the vocals.  But her acting was flawless, and this can certainly be forgiven. <br /> <br />If you're looking for THE definitive \\"cover\\" of the B'Way musical, you'll never find it.  If you choose to look at this as yet another version of ALW's vision, you'll probably enjoy it a great deal.  If you simply want to see good cinema, then you WILL enjoy this film, no qiestions asked.   <br /> <br />In the day and age of modern cinema where: <br />1.  An \\"epic\\" is 95 minutes long with bad casting and even worse scripting and production,  <br />2.  Where blood and gore and mindless violence rules, <br />3.  Remakes of J-Horror, Chinese Martial Arts imports, Tolkien novels and comic book remakes dominate the American movie lists because most original stuff is pure garbage (with the exception of Kill Bill),  <br /> <br />...this film is a complete breath of fresh air.  Rent it for the experience.  If you want extras, btw, get the two-disc edition.  I rented the single-disk edition and was disappointed that there were NO extras.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|hi, i am a devout trey parker/matt stone fan and was very excited when this movie came out.  i had a great time watching it and would probably give it a B to a B+, like 86.5% or something.  its not really as funny the whole way as a lot of my favorite funny movies like Dirty Work, Almost Heroes, or B movies like Cool As Ice (by Robert Van Winkle aka Vanilla Ice).  It has funny parts my favorite being Kim Jong Il's panthers which are just some confused kittens with panther sounds in the background. <br /> <br />but what i really, really love about this movie is the soundtrack.  i listen to it on a regular basis and probably will for the forseable future.  its fun, its funny, and it really hits on political crap and stereotype crap.  for example now when its 2:00 am on a monday morning and i have a term paper due the next morning i listen to \\"montage\\" for inspiration.  then when i think of my current girlfriend who i don't really care about i listen to \\"only a woman.\\"  my favorite part of that track: <br /> <br />\\"and on saturdays when i've been partyin' hard <br />and its four in the morning and i'm on my fifth tab of E <br />that's the only time i don't really care if you are woman!!!\\" <br /> <br />i'm pretty excited to see the unrated stuff, i heard there's puppet penetration, urination, and defecation.  'bout f-in' time.  i guess if i was cool and lived in a big city they've been playing the unrated version in small moviehouses since it came out.  oh well, i'm in iowa. <br /> <br />welp that's all i have to say, almost, later be. <br /> <br />\\"what would you do? <br />if someone told you to fight for freedom. <br />would you answer the call? <br />or run away like a little pussy?\\"
B0007OCG4W|4.0|I'd give this five stars, but although I play a cynic on TV, I'm actually a gushy romantic...and this movie is many things, but romantic? Not one of them.<br /><br />That being said, there's a lot of good things going on here. The cast, in addition to being overwhelming beautiful, is really spot-on. Natalie Portman steals the show, but all of the four leads  inhabit their characters with force.<br /><br />The story is every bit, or even more, subversive than you might think, and I loved that. It was somewhat over-the-top...but not really. Real life, oftentimes, is darker and crazier and more painful than most films are willing to portray. Kudos to the filmmakers for daring to go there.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I am sick of this band, and honestly, I'm sick of the faggots who hate it too and are suggesting bands like Slipknot, Lamb Of God, and other almost-as-gay-as-limp-bizkit bands.  Limp Bizkit is probably among the worst bands I've ever heard, along with Slipknot which has more band members than instruments in a music store, and less talent than in a newborn monkey with cerebral palsy.  If you decide to be less retarded, then go get music by the following bands: <br /> <br />Children of Bodom <br />In Flames <br />Blind Guardian <br />Metallica (old) <br />Iron Maiden <br />Judas Priest <br />Iced Earth <br />3 Inches of Blood <br /> <br />among others.  And whoever that idiot was who bashed on LB and then starts talking about f*cking Korn, Ill Nino, Coal Chamber, Shadows Fall, Slipknot and Skinlab?  holy christ man, save yourself before its too late! all of you! ARMORED FIST!!
B0000017CA|5.0|this album is the beginning and the end. that's all you have to know. emerging from the same sludgey south that birthed eyehategod and buzz*oven, this album is much more ominous and more sophisticated than their hack and slash (but no less godly) brethren, employing the graven atmospheres and sung vocals of vintage candlemass, memento mori and solitude aeternus as well as elements of crust punk, grind, death metal and slow as f--k sludgecore breakdowns. this WILL kick your teeth in, albeit in a much more elegant fashion that dopesick did.
0446677450|5.0|The powerful message in this book is: financial wealth is in the bank not in your garage or on your wrist. Those achieve financial success, and with it peace of mind, are great savers. Displays of wealth merely deplete your bank account.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Ignorance really IS annoying, esp. when someone stupid tries to appear smart and what not. To correct the self-proclaimed \\"witch-hunter\\":    \\"One scene springs to mind when he leaps on a gargoyle and yells `that's all I ask of youuuuuuuuuuu!!!'\\"    At least do your homework and quote it correctly!    \\"The added storyline about him being in a circus freak show is bull. This man is supposed to be a genius but he makes huge mistakes in the movie and it ruined his character.\\"    Seems that this person hasn't read Leroux's book as Erik has been among gypsies indeed (As a showcase) in his youth and he wasn't with them because they loved him. Darling, it's not the actor making \\"mistakes\\", that actually IS the storyline, it's the storyline of the stage-show as well. Too bad that you don't seem to have a clue.    \\"He starts off with a little mask on, black slicked down hair, normal visible skin and then she whips it off and all of a sudden half this guys face is deformed even his hairline has receded, and speaking of hair, its now a rather sandy colour and sticks out, obviously in an attempted to achieve that `mad scientist' look It ruins the whole moment.\\"    God, are you blind? He's wearing a WIG! And what not! He wears a wig in the show too and so?    \\"And his death...that didn't happen. In the book he plays his organ (why does that sound bad, I have a dirty mind) until the whole opera house caves in on top off him.\\"    Were you actually reading LEROUX's book? What you're describing sounds like the ending of the campy Phantom-movie with Claude Rains. (BAD stuff!) So you have NOT read the book, aren't able to recognize that the Phantom wore a wig and what not? Tell you what, such ignorance is laughable.    I loved this movie but I love the stage-show even more! Try to catch both!    Addition:    Well, she also says now:    \\"You say it's a wig, oh really! In those days, they didn't have wigs that good for heaven sakes.\\"    Yes, they did. In fact it is pretty easy to producea wig like that. Watch the scene where the Phantom is preparing for \\"The Point of no Return\\" (\\"Let my opera begiiiiiiiiin!\\" ends that scene) he's ADJUSTING what is obviously a wig on his head. As for 19th century wigs: They had REAL HAIR wigs that looked AMAZINGLY real on men and women. Women who copied Elisabeth of Austria's hairstyle (Her hair went down to her toes) used fake hair and wigs to perfection.      \\"If the director intended for the phantom to wear a wig he should of made it obvious.\\"    He did. In the scene I described above. Hell, there's even ANOTHER wig on one of the stone-heads near the Phantom in that scene (Look down at his left side). (Guess he had to switch them now and then) How much more obvious can it BE until you get it? Look at him as he sings \\"Christine, that's all I ask of....\\"...you can see his real hair beneath the wig..     \\"So I retract your statement about me being `blind' and if you freeze frame the dvd its crystal clear that she only pulls his mask off(nether a wig to be seen) and he transforms like magic.\\"    It's the ANGLE, dear. The wig comes OFF with the mask, just like in the show where a very similar wig is used. And yes, you CAN see it fall off with the mask.     \\"Me cago en tus muertos! Add a big gob of imaginary spit. How's that by being raised by gypsies.\\"    That's childish and dumb. The next time you act like a know-it-all on POTO do your homework first.
B0002SROT0|4.0|When I first got this album, I must admit I was a bit disappointed. Yes, I know it's a posthumously released album, and when you buy one of these, you're always going to be left wondering, \\"What would this sound like if the guy had been alive to release it himself?\\"  <br /> <br />So naturally, all that went through my mind, and at first I thought I was going to regret buying this. There were too many tracks. The recordings didn't sound polished enough. The order seemed kind of uneven. <br /> <br />And then, BAM! <br /> <br />One day, this CD just hit me. And I suddenly couldn't get enough of it. <br /> <br />The songwriting is brilliant, as always. No one could ever dispute this man's ability to write. Even so, after listening to this CD for awhile, I feel he was trying to take his writing to entirely new places. \\"Twilight,\\" for instance, is a beautiful track that seems like it could have been the next phase of his beautiful ballad writing a la \\"Either/Or\\", and the opener, \\"Coast to Coast,\\" is a cool, guitar-and-piano-laden rocker that seems to be an advance on the direction he was heading in with his two previous efforts, \\"XO\\" and \\"Figure 8.\\" And then there are dark, ethereal numbers like \\"King's Crossing\\" that seem to indicate his songwriting was on his way to new places altogether. <br /> <br />In any case, a great album---not as strong, perhaps, as \\"XO\\" (but then again, few albums I've ever heard are....), but still well worth the purchase price. It may not hit you over the head when you first play it, but give it a couple of listens. I promise you won't regret it.
1575666286|1.0|Please be careful with coffee enemas and anything that has to do with the Gerson name. I read Max Gerson books and also Charlotte Gersons book. Believed in them, talked to people in their SO called institute (they all consider them geniuses) and so I thought. I did not even have cancer but wanted to improve my health. COFFEE ENEMAS are dangerous and can kill. Some people seem to tolerate them up to some point. They destroyed my life. After 5 weeks in this therapy started liver pains, problems digesting, skin rashes, INSOMNIA, etc. and have not gone away. I even had one of their so called Gerson Practitioners. Everybody washed their hands when things went wrong. THIS IS A WARNING. Can't tell you what to do if you have cancer. BUT BE careful with COFFEE ENEMAS. Also thyroid, liquid iodine, potasium (your electrolites can also be affected). They will say anything to convince you that it is so safe and remember their supplements are money to them and their hospital even more. If you buy Max Gerson blue book read it carefully. He mentions a ton of people he actually killed when giving them this or that, including a child; someone who ended up with cirrhosis of the liver, etc. People seem to have been used as guinea pigs. Only after things go wrong you realize this. WARNING: if something goes wrong they say it is your toxins that did it!! and you are on your own.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I watched this movie (the dubbed version) for my sophmore English class.  We had recently read the short novel, Night by Elie Wiesel.  My friend, who had seen the movie before, said it was really \\"cute\\".  Cute?  CUTE?  How could a Holocaust film be CUTE?  Needless to say, I didn't believe her. <br />But we started to watch the movie and it was!  It was hilarious for the first part, at least.  My favorite comedic scene was when he pretended to be a school inspector and talked about Italian bellybuttons.  My other favorite scene is at the end of the movie.  When the tank comes.  The little boy was adorable.   <br />And all of that led to the downfall.  You just loved those characters so much and you found yourself rooting for them. Which made it sadder. <br />I loved.  It provides a somewhat light hearted view of the Holocaust and for any high school teachers using a book with rthe Holocaust, I hgihly reccomend this movie. Our class was actually reacting and laughing.
B00029NMRW|1.0|This movies is not bad. It's worse than that, it is.... useless. Yes, I asted 98 minutes of my life watching it (otherwise I would not review it!), but I advise you to not do so. It's really weak, the onnly average performance is by Willis, who seems to be having fun. The rest of the cast is lost inside a screenplay that has abolutely nothing to offer.

With a talent-mass like this..it is really beyond me...how they can put out..something so...\\"going thru'the motions\\" like !! I miss the heart..the soul..the deep felt themes in the songs. And they are quite capable of delivering that,just not on this release !!Wanna hear them in excellence??? Go for:\\" A Change of seasons\\" or \\"Scenes from a memory\\" !! The hard- core DREAM THEATER freak might suggest other releases,but to me, those mentioned titles are the best! Sorry guys...this album only get a single star. If you need further proof of the involved musicians excellence...then try out:EXPLORERS CLUB (Petrucci /LaBrie/Sherinian) :\\"Age of impact\\".....or : TRANSATLANTIC ( Portnoy)..both albums (well there are the live albums as well) ...enuff said..these guys are superb musicians.....but this album....are just plain boring!

B000021XS0|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could give a masterpiece like this less than five stars.  As a musician, I am, of course, forced to bow in reverence when I hear Petrucci solo, but as an avid music fan I also find the music at times exciting, saddening, and completely absorbing. It seems absolutely ridiculous to slight this album for perceived faults such as overlong solos or technical showboating; with music this startlingly original and entertaining, why cut it short?
0385510454|3.0|When I first read the dust jacket, I thought this was going to be a top notch Grisham read.  The concept behind the story, one must admit, is innovative and exciting. <br /> <br />However, the story itself lets you down, albeit just a little.  We are left unsure of Backman the lawyer (only constantly reminded that he was shady, yet great in his dealings).  Perhaps a chapter or two of flashback, or even just a chapter or two of introduction of Joel Backman as a lawyer would have augmented the text.  Instead, we are left with a prisoner that we are assured belonged there and got what was coming to him.  After this, we are left with a sympathetic character that seemed neither hardened nor regretful (at least not until the end) after his six years in prison, solitary confinement, no less.  What I am getting at is that the charcter development left much to be desired. <br /> <br />The ending was also disappointing.  This was so for many reasons: (1) The Chinese are sure to still be angry, and their lethal assasin isn't going to let Backman off the hook.  Surely there can be no happy ending as we are left to believe, (2) the fact that the U.S. Government let him off so easy is laughable, and (3) we never again heard from Teddy Maynard, the erstwhile CIA Director that hashes this plan, and is subsequently dismissed, and (4) the former President is hot water, yet this is left to pasture after we find there to be no ties between the President and Backman's pardon, at least financially. <br /> <br />All that crying and moaning beside us, the book is a quick read and often enjoyable.  Grisham paints a beautiful picture of Italy, and clearly enjoyed his research there.  The story was good, even if the peripheral details were weak at times.  I would recommend reading this book, but read The Firm or The Runaway Jury first, if you are new to Grisham.
B000062X9B|5.0|Johnny Cash is better than receiving real cash; you know, dollar bills. This album is fantastic. I just got done listening to and reviewing the first album in the American Recordings series, and this one is even better than it, in my opinion. These songs are even darker, more romantic, and introspective than the songs on the first Rubin-produced album. \\"Before My Time\\" and \\"Would You Lay With Me (In A Field Of Stone)\\" are enough to make any human being cry. This definitely isn't the Cash album to put on if you want to tap your feet and have a good time, though. This music is high art, and if you look close enough, you will find that it has the same sentiments that can be found in classic cinema or Eastern philosophy; there is an intangible beauty to all of them. The really funny part is that I don't enjoy Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Beck, and many of the other artists whose songs Cash covers in this series. If you are sitting alone one night, pondering your future or the meaning of life, put this cd on and let Johnny Cash work his magic.
044024157X|1.0|This is by far one of the worst books I have ever read! I typically find Grisham books to be entertaining. However, this book was a total bore. In a perfect world, this would have been a great 20 page short story. Hopefully they will not attempt to make this into a movie!
0767817478|5.0|I can't understand all the negative reviews on this movie. I first saw in theaters when i was 9, and I couldn't get enough of it. I begged my parents to take me again and again. And now, I love it just as much. The makers of Godzilla, who also made another notable action movie in '96 with Independence Day, show that you don't need gooey sentamentalism and boring talk to make an action movie (something that the makers of the Hulk need to learn a thing or two about). The story centers on goofy biologist Nick Tatopolus, who is investigating a gigantic monster loose in New York, along with an ex-girlfriend and a smart-aleck newsman. Filled with incredible action, humor, and amazing special effects, Godzilla is pure entertainment for the entire family.
B000002UAC|5.0|WITH THE BEATLES is the first of the two great albums from the Beatlemania period (the other being A Hard Day's Night).  The band takes a leap from its debut album, Please Please Me, and has established its sound: tight, three-part harmonies, George's finger-picking guitar solos, Paul's balladry, John's shouting vocals, and Ringo's steady backbeat and cymbal wash.  Altogether, this album is the soundtrack to 1963 Britain and 1964 across the ocean.<br />The album has energy and drive from the very first note.  It Won't Be Long is a driving opener with exciting back-and-forth vocals between Lennon and the other Beatles.  All I've Got To Do is a slower, soulful version of the same song, but just as effective.  If you could pull a single off the album, then All My Loving would be the best candidate.  Paul's number features a fine Chet Atkins-style solo from George.  Little Child picks up the tempo with some fine harmonica playing by John.  Don't Bother Me is a decent song, but more importantly marks George's songwriting debut.  Till There Was You is the first cover of the album and solidifies Paul's reputation as the band's balladeer.  Please Please Me must be one the best Motown covers ever with its drop-dead &quot;WAIT!&quot; intro and tremendous vocals.<br />The second half of the album opens with the spotlight on George doing a wonderful Roll Over Beethoven.  However, now we run into some lesser songs: Hold Me Tight (sounds incomplete and out of key) and I Wanna be Your Man (little more than a chant).  To compensate, The Beatles produce a pair of fine Motown covers, Devil In Her Heart and You Really Got A Hold On Me.  The call-and-response vocals on the latter, I must admit, outshine the Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles original (sorry).  Not A Second Time features a fine melody and the first of John's &quot;anti-love songs&quot;.  The last Motown cover is the best, Money, which features one of the all-time Lennon vocals.  Compare it to the Plastic Ono Band albumof 1970 or even Cobain's vocals and you''ll hear a direct progression.  <br />WITH THE BEATLES is the first great Beatles.  A unified style runs through its 14 tracks, both covers and originals, led by John Lennon who was firmly in command of his band, its sound and vision.  More so than the debut album, WITH THE BEATLES is the sound of America rock and soul (Chuck Berry, Motown), but filtered through four kids growing up in a major British seaport after World War Two.  The Beatles created something familiar yet altogether new, and injected bland early-sixties  pop with a good shot of rock.  Even today, the album still bursts with energy.<br />The only weakness of this album -- and this period -- are the lyrics.  They remain in the innocent girl-meets-boy vein, common for its time, and don't  reflect the influence of Bob Dylan.  Dylan along with the 12-string Rickenbacher, will enter the Beatles' orbit in the coming year, and the results will be history.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|Independence Day is not just a movie. It's more than that. It is an action movie of epic proportions, filled with explosive action, and good characters. The film centers around the President of the United States (Bill Pullman), a nerdy scientist (Jeff Goldblum) and an all-American fighter pilot (Will Smith) and how those three characters react to the alien invasion of the world. Many people just dismiss this movie as 'sci-fi'. While parts of that is true, it's a bit closer to Armageddon than Star Wars. I have always loved this movie and still do. Now, where's Independence Day 2?
B00007GZQI|4.0|What a Film! Very busy and very \\"out there\\" ! It certainly can't be accused of being dull. I especially liked the \\"worker's revolt\\" on board the ship towards the end, and then they realise that they haven't even left port yet. But for most of the movie you find yourself just sitting there going..WHAAT?. Very silly and completley unbeleivable, but if your expecting realism then you wouldn't be interested in this movie anyway. You either get this movie or you don't, most of the satire is current to when it was made so you will miss a lot of the jokes. But it's still worth seeing in my opinion. So see it !!!!!
0446613444|5.0|<br />If you need a book that will get you interested in reading again, then this is it. Harry Bosch is back and couldn't be more of a badass in this notorious, stay up until 4 AM, can't stop, won't stop thriller that will make you wish that this novel was a movie. With Harry Bosch's relentless attitude, it's a mystery book to end all mystery books, that makes Law and Order look like Connely's slightly retarted cousin. Harry Bosch has balls the size of grapefruits and an even larger brain with twists and turns so confusing that it makes you glad that Bosch is on your side. Do not pass this up for some scooby doo novel, and if you do I will personally come to a book store near you and kick your ass. You miss it, you diss it. Holla Back. <br /> <br />                                        -Keith Bartley <br />                                            A.K.A. <br />                                          Don't Blink <br /> <br />

B0007Z4S4C|5.0|The band is tight and Plant hits all the right notes in this release. Plant's singing is quieter throughout but not less moving. Some of the Zep-like yells are not his forte anymore anyhow! It sounds on some of the tracks that a new form of music is being forged -- electronica/cerebral rock -- but it is all done with real musicians and real instruments so its all quite natural sounding. I think any Zep fan should enjoy this one.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Prog metal, space punk, electronica, psych jazz; The Mars Volta are often labled all of these and more. This is because when people hear the Mars Volta, they are confused, and they feel that they must be placed in a genre to make listening more confortable. The Mars Volta, however, are none of these really; they're just amazing. <br /> <br />De-loused in the Comatorium is definitely one of the top 5 best CDs I own. The Mars Volta are excellent musicians. I listen to primarily jazz and fusion, and very few 'rock' bands, if you will, intrigue me. This group however aren't just a bunch of mindless rockers who are filthy rich. They are musicians. De-Loused is composed of very melodic key changes and intricate rhythm structers that are much more appealing to those who have a musical background. The intrumentation is very clever and the arranging is so emotional. The lyrics are very thought-provoking. I suggest you read the bio at themarsvolta.com to fully understand what De-Loused is all about. If you like albums like Tool's Lateralus or Radiohead's Hail to the Thief, give the Mars Volta a try. Don't let your idea of At the Drive-In persuade you, all though Relationship of Command is probably the closest of atdi albums to the sound produced by the Mars Volta. <br /> <br />Very unique. Try it out. I have been listening to Francis the Mute a lot recently, but in my opinion De-Loused in the Comatorium is much better.    <br />
B0007XT87G|4.0|I've had Deadwing for a little over two weeks now and after many (and I do mean many) repeated listenings, I'm finally coming to grips with this CD. I like it-a lot. It's not as good as their last three discs (Stupid Dream, Lightbulb Sun or In Absentia), but it is still a thoroughly good listen. I seem to come to this band from a different direction than most of the reviewers. I'm not a fan of Opeth or Metal in general, I prefer Marillion and the like. So I tend to favor the slower, dreamier tracks like Arriving Somewhere instead of the harder tracks like Halo or Shallow.  <br /> <br />This band has had an incredible string of really top-notch albums and to say this is a bit below par shouldn't belittle the effort. It is loaded with great songs, and this band deserves to be recognized after all the years of semi-obscurity. Hopefully, this summer's US tour will be a success. They've earned it.  <br /> <br />Follow me down to the Valley below...
B000667GFK|2.0|I have some of Luis Miguel's albums and I enjoyed them but when it comes to this classics, I prefer to listen to the originals. I respect other people's opinions but for me it just was not good enough especially from a big star like him. His interpretations lack emotion, it's like they were recorded just for the sake of recording them because they're popular tunes. \\"De que manera te olvido\\", he sang it with absolutely no emotion, it's so bland. Vicente Fernandez made this song famous and is probably the best interpretation, but also deserves mention is Eliseo Robles y los barbaros del Norte who's recording of \\"de que manera... \\" is my personal favorite. \\"Un Mundo Raro\\", I prefer Jose Alfredo Jimenez, and also recordings by Vicente Fernandez and Aida Cuevas. The only song on this album that I enjoyed is \\" Entrega Total \\" but I have the Javier Solis recording and that is so much better.
B000002IKR|5.0|This album is a must-have for any axe-slinger. If you want to hear some GREAT guitar leads, riffs...don't wait anymore. Get this album and learn some of these songs. When you get through with the track \\"Over The Wall\\" you will thank me. As far as comparing them to Metallica...I would not go that far. If you compare the guitars. Everything Metallica has recorded can't come close to the technicality of Testament. Smooth transitions and beautiful turn-arounds. Lots of jazz elements as well. If you like this album, pick up Testament - The Ritual and listen to the track \\"Return To Serenity\\". Any guitar player will cry when they hear those licks. And if you wanna hear some REALLY good obscure thrash metal. Pick up Artillery - By Inheritance.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I think this is a very good cd, as usual Nin goes in a different direction compared to their previous albums and with only a few exceptions (The Collector for example) I love the entire album. Go download \\"Only\\" it's a great track, their should be a video released for it sometime around June.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Even though Nausicaa is the first full-length film made by Miyazaki, it is the last one I watched.  In fact I have watched Howl's Moving Castle before watching Nausicaa.  If Howl is the most beautiful hero Miyazaki created, then Nausicaa is the most beautiful heroine.   <br /> <br />Miyazaki's later adventurous film usually start with a bang and the story reach a climax after a few minutes into the film e.g. Spirited away and Howl's moving castle. With Nausicaa the story moves more slowly in the beginning to pave way for the climax toward at the end of the film.  I highly recommend you to watch Nausicaa because it is one of Miyazaki's best work.
B00005K9LM|5.0|This is the CD to pop in when getting on the freeway. Freewheel Burning starts the CD off right. As soon as the drums kick in, that's when you need to punch the gas. This was the first JP album I bought, back in 1984. Then I started to collect all the JP albums after that. Sadly, I only have this one and Screaming For Vengeance left. No Hell Bent or Sin after Sin. Word to the wise: Don't let friends borrow your albums! This is the classic heavy metal album. Priest went downhill with the Turbo album after that. They abandoned the leather for some other garb. This album rocks with Freewheel, Jawbreaker, the Sentinel. I can't comment on the extra track because I have the old CD version of Defenders. This has to be in any self respecting metalhead's collection. Forget about Rob Halford being gay, the man has some pipes to his singing. Of course listening to the album's lyrics, I realize he was talking about men instead of having women eat him alive at gunpoint. Disregard him being gay and act like you never knew.
B00003CX5P|4.0|In A Time Magazaine article dated March 6, 1978 on page 82 he discussed his plans for more than ten SEQUELS. No prequels! And originally the '77 relaesed star Wars film was not to be Star Wars 4: A New Hope. The Empire Strikes Back was supposed to be Star Wars 2!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|is this a joke? I'm not surprised that there are many aggressive idiots here calling people who don't like this last DT album as as*holes and b*tches etc. They are fanatics, eating everything from their beloved band. I thought this is a review section of this superb site and everyone can say his own opinion on the subject. Well, now to the album... Definitely in my opinion (hey, all you nervous people, do you see that word?) this is the worst DT album they have ever made. I like all their previous albums, I wouldn't give them less than 4 stars. But now I'm afraid that DT isn't interesting for me anymore. They moved to metal music \\"look how fast I can play it\\" and that's not what I'm exactly looking for. Do you want metal music with lots of progressive elements inside, musical styles and emotional depth? Ok, then do not buy this album. Get Arena's \\"Contagion\\", Pain Of Salvation's \\"Be\\" or anything from Threshold. So that's an advice for the guy who hasn't found any band that can compare to DT. These bands can compare to them and they easily overtop Train Of Thoughts. Well, they may not be able to play solos so fast but I don't really care 'cos I listen to music, not technical showing-off
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I liked the movie. Intricate, well developed plot and characters, looks more literary then usual for a movie. I appreciate the self sacrificial nature of the solution, and wonder who the girl eventually married at the end (his younger brother?, kid #4?). I watch movies to experience new things, to get a little bit of harmless action and a rush, but mostly to see what people think. And i was not dissatified on any level with this movie. It asks thoughtful questions like: but for one moments error i would be .....?, but for the grace of God go i, what is happiness?, if you really love someone can you write yourself out of the picture for their sake?. there is a good solution if you just keep trying.etc.<br /><br /> I liked the way the journals moved in and out of the various lives, of course the baby never  wrote so it ended there. I think journal writing is important and i hope the movie stimulates at least a few teens to start writing them.<br /><br />good movie, watch it. no real downside but a stretch of possibilities, but done realistically, acceptably.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I'm sorry, but I don't buy the words of the guy, who claims to work for Lucas, that they could not give the lightsabers the same look as the 1970's era films because of a HD transfer! That is balderdash! I never heard such malarky! In this day and age the original films could be released just as they were when they were shown! Even if there was a problem with how the lightsabers looked with the technology available they could be fixed like that. <br /> <br />The only reason the sabers will be changed is so they can match with the new films. <br /> <br />I have read Lucas' comment that in one hundred years there will be only one version of his Star Wars films! <br /> <br />I truly hope, that I don't have to wait until George Lucas is dead before the original uncut and unadded too versions of these classic films will be released! <br /> <br />The coloring and shadings of the original films has been spoiled as well by the way too. <br /> <br />I have the original versions on Laser Disc and plan on coping them to my DVD recorder soon! <br /> <br />I'm sorry that George Lucas, the guy I admired so much as a child who brought Star Wars (1977) and Raiders of the Lost Ark to the screen has now become such a repelent taste in my mouth!!!
B00005AAFS|4.0|anyone who thinks they're into metal...will own this. Plain and simple. Tthey may not be the heaviest thing in town, however those bass guitars and riffs plus heavy drum beats make them a perfect band to headbang along to.  <br /> <br />Although I don't know what the hell they're singing about because i don't speak German, the music is so good that the lyrics don't mean s***!  <br /> <br />Great album!
B0000BXGCN|5.0|Lara Fabian may very well have the most beautiful voice on the whole planet, and no album demonstrates that more than En Toute Intimite. - she hardly even needs the piano and cello accompaniments and she displays a vocal range that other singers can only dream about. This is a live recording, the quality of which is unsurpassed. Never mind if you don't speak French - that won't stop you from enjoying an immensely talented singer.  And if her French weren't beautful enough, there are a couple of tracks to show that her Italian is no worse.
B000002WYW|5.0|Yeah, I know that's a big statement considering how classic \\"36 Chambers\\" is.  \\"36 Chambers\\" had a unique sound but it isn't something that you can ride in your car with because the sound is too low amplified, the only way to enjoy that cd is to listen in a stereo system.  And I'm not considering the solo Wu albums because then GZA's \\"Liquid Sword\\" is the best rap album ever!<br /><br />\\"Wu-Tang Forever\\" gets some what of a weaker ratings from reviewers because it has 26 songs and some are not as strong as the others.  Well that's exactly what I've done when I got the cd, I chopped the weaker ones and made a customize cd (although I had to omitt some good ones). so everytime I pop that cd I'm listening to gems and classic Wu-Tang beats crafted mainly by RZA.  This album should be the quintessential rap album and what hip-hop should sound like.  I can't stop listening to Wu-Tang sounds and this album provides the high for me. Love this album and love the best rap group there ever will be!
B000002UJQ|5.0|To all you naysayers out there, check out who has been prasing Radiohead and attending their concerts: Everyone from REM  and U2 to Nine Inch Nails; from Marilyn Manson to Madonna.  Odds are unless your musical taste is restrited only to 50 Cent and Nelly than your favorite music have been influenced by Radiohead.  How else would all of these artists enjoy Radiohead if there weren't somthing special about this music.
0316776963|5.0|The first book I stumbled upon by David Sedaris was \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\".  I found it laying on a table of Barnes & Noble, so I picked up and started reading the first page (I was interested because of the title).  And instantly after the first paragraph, I was hooked and I knew this writer is one the funniest and wittiest writer today.  I was literally rolling on the table every couple of minutes and it was getting embrassing reading the book front of other unknown people.<br /><br />David Sedaris's \\"Naked\\" and \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is his autobiography but he writes them in an unusual method: he writes them as essays and there not accounts of his life in a linear path, rather one piece from his childhood, then his life in Paris, France, or his addiction problems, etc.  He could be writing about one of the saddest moment of his life and still put some smart-ass comment that makes one cringe with laughter.  Highly recommeded to anyone who wants to really experience 'laugh-out-loud' from a book and also have a sense-of-humor.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|Loved by some metal fans and hated by prog fans. Strange Evolution no?? (if this can be called evolution) Actually I like this, it has one or two good tracks, but but... this album as a whole entity is nothing, its just music well played (excersise instructions r not?) but it has nothing to say, besides it has a dirty sound nothing to do compared with the previous ones. After SDOIT (which i love) i thought they were going to follow that rout, instead they were for the metal rout but without sense. Other thing that i didn't like about this albumis that JORDAN RUDESS didn`t on this one... ah ah.. Did he play her??? ahh ok did he do it like a guess?? no no... PETRUCCI & PORTNOY didn't give any chance to him to get involved in it... what a waste of such a musician!!!. As i said, there are some good track, ENDLESS SACRIFICE has some SFAM feeling some good changes, some RUDESS touches, well... a good, STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS is the best track, well structured, a good progressive aproach, (well, progressive is too much for this album!!!). Other thing that i missed was a \\"grand finale\\", like learning to live, finally free... you know. IN THE NAME OF GOD is a good song but it doesn't have the DT magic, it has some feeling but... nt enough for DT. Well, i hope a next try but more progressive otherwise... they will be pulling under my faith on them.
0553573403|1.0|I am in the middle of this book and although I am reading study almost every night I have to agree with some of the other reviewers referencing to the following:<br /><br />a) Lack of action<br /><br />b) Way too many characters<br /><br />c) Bland script<br /><br />d) Best part was in the first 20 pages....the rest seems to be all down hill.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|The third installment of Daft Punk's discography, \\"Human after All\\", is an excellent fusion of their two previous albums.  While \\"discovery\\" was smattered with lyrical content, \\"homework\\" was not.  \\"Human after All\\" blends the repetitive repetitive of the \\"homework\\" album with the lyrical innovations of \\"discovery\\".  Quite poetic with tracks like \\"the prime time of your life\\" and \\"television rules the nation\\"; daft punk rips a hole in tv watchers everywhere.  The loops in most songs on this album are much more complex than that of their previous work, thus showing a continual progression from the two frenchmen.  I recommend anyone that is considering buying this album to visit daft punk's website and watch the video for 'robot rock'.  If you were introduced to daft punk by the \\"discovery\\" album, chances are you will find you like \\"human\\" less.  For those who started with \\"homework\\", you will enjoy 8 or 9 of the 10 tracks.
0062502182|4.0|People either love this book or hate it.  There seems to be no inbetween.  This was my first introduction to this author and I think it was a good one to start with, considering other books he's written have also been considered \\"elementary\\".  However, I loved this book.  I can understand how some would consider this simple, but I expected that since it's portrayed as a fable.  Most fables are told in a simple manner so a wider audience can understand. <br /> <br />If one is open to what the author has to say without any preconceived notion tainting one's judgement, one's overall experience tends to be better. <br /> <br />My hope is that you will give this book a chance because it really does have some gems of truth that should not be overlooked.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's Nevermind album is absolutely amazing. It is essential in any real rock music collection. Every song on it just works, from the blaring riffs of \\"Teen Spirit\\", to the haunting acoustics of \\"Something in the Way\\". It's second only to In Utero as Nirvana's best album. The only thing that ticks me off is the average 15 year old who wears all black and thinks that his life sucks because he can't get the newest xbox game, picking up this album just because. These are the people who Kurt sings about in \\"In Bloom\\", people who listen to his music but don't understand what it all means. This is REAL rock, you poser. Stick with your crappy Linkin Park and Korn.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Do not buy this album. <br /> <br />Besides being extremely horrible in the aspect of musicianship, the lyrics are, well hardly understandable , and secondly, even worse then the musicality of this band. <br /> <br />I am a musician and a big fan of metal, and Slipknot is noise. If you're into the kind of music that leaves you wondering what you just listened to and if it was in fact music at all, then by all means purchase this CD.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a metal band with a creative approach and something original, look elsewhere.
0345457684|5.0|Snow Crash (another more famous \\"cyberpunk\\" novel) is like a kids cartoon compared to this gritty, sexual and violent novel. R. M. sets the world, the year 25K, alive. Don't look for pandering descriptions of the world of tomorrow though. The future unravels slowly with only the bits necessary for the story shown. The plot on the other hand doesn't unravel as much as bowl you over. This is one of the only books I've read, other than ghost stories, which have the main character die within the first three pages. The gunfight on the first pages sets the pace for the rest of the book and Morgan's descriptions are amazing.  <br /> <br />This is not for anyone who is easily offended by violence or sexual situations. But don't let that hinder your enjoyment of the novel, the V and S fit perfectly into the world Morgan has crafted. Look at our tendencies as a society now and you may see our future printed in this book.  <br /> <br />If you do decide to read Altered Carbon it would be my advice to remember all of the names referenced early on. My memory is bad to say the least and I wish someone had warned me to pay closer attention.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this to anyone who loves great sci-fi with a believable cohesive future and tons of action (oh yeah, the mystery is pretty slick to).  <br /> <br />PS. Don't get me wrong, I loved Snow Crash too. <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|This is one hell of a CD. The Story of Armstrong and the way the CD moves is amazing. The music and lyrics are both good. The music is good all the way through and the same with the lyrics with the exception of one track. The lyrics for American Idiot are a pain in the a**. The idea that this country is run by the media and that rednecks are in charge is absurd. For one thing my Grandparents and great grandparents are rednecks and I know damn well that they counldn't run the country. The lyrics for this song pissed me off because some people find it offensive and hell, I have nothing against the song. Its great, but I just think that the lyrics are stupid. But after that come Jesus of Suburbia and , while borderline sacrelige at times, it is an amazing song about a broken home that has one child that can't seem to find his happiness. I think that this CD is great and I can't wait for the next one.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This album is not quite what Pretty Hate or Downward Spiral are, but it is every bit as good.  It just further adds to the idea that Trent Reznor has never released a single song that hasn't kicked a**.  TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RATED THIS ALBUM WITH A 2, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THE MUSIC THAT YOUR FAVORITE ARTISTS RELEASE HAS TO CHANGE OVER TIME.  IF IT FAILS TOO, THEN YOUR FAVORITE ARTIST WILL FAIL TO LAST.  THEY WILL BE SO FAR DOWN THE SPIRAL THAT THEY WILL BECOME A CLICHE, AND BE MOCKED.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|NO JOKE- THIS CD IS NOW A COASTER ON MY COFFEE TABLE- JUST TO PROTEST HOW BAD IT IS-- MY FRIENDS AGREE (NOT ALL, BUT A LOT) THAT THIS ALBUM IS PURE DONKEY
B000009QPE|5.0|Anyone who thinks that this album sucks does not know metal.  They are wuss Motley Crue fans that think they are hardcore. I will personally spit on all of your graves and laugh about it. <br /> <br />This is the heaviest album I have ever heard, and totally kicks ass. Only a handful of albums can compare to Reign In Blood's anger and aggression, and none of them surpass it. This album starts off with \\"Angel of Death\\". You know a song is downright evil when the first word is Auchwitz, the worst concentration camp in the Holocaust. The guitar is incredibly heavy throughout the album, and Raining Blood has the best opening riff since Seek & Destroy! I love the thrash in Jesus Saves and Criminally Insane. The only problem I have is that songs like Reborn and Piece by Piece aren't longer. I need more METAL! <br /> <br />To end my yappin, Reign in Blood is a metal enema for the entire world to pick up, and makes Poison or Motley Crue look like a bunch of girls.
0743487478|5.0|I am always amazed at people's reactions to truth. In reading some of the less enthusiastic reviews here, I can't help but want to point out that this book touched a chord in them because they are defending their own need to parent conditionally. Alfie Kohn is not extreme or radical or unreasonable in any way. What he writes about speaks to a child's healthy psyche, spirit and self. But it takes a parent who is self-aware and honest enough to look within in order to think about things from a child's point of view. I ask this: if conditional parenting (timeouts, spanking, bribery, punishments, etc) apparently \\"works,\\" then why do we have so many people in jail, on drugs, on the streets, on Prozac, suffering from eating disorders, abusing themselves and others, crashing and burning, cheating, gambling, running,staggering out of failed marriages and sabotaging jobs and their own potential??? <br />Alfie Kohn dares to speak out about something deeply human and ironically profoundly difficult for so many people to grasp and accept. Many parents want control of their children because those adults are threatened by anything that affects their perceived power and suppressed fears. Since so many adults are wounded, unresolved, still suffering the slings and arrows of their own upbringing, they feel only marginally better about themselves if they are keeping the children \\"in line.\\" It's tragic. And I applaud Alfie Kohn for having the passion and courage to advocate for our children. How many adults are in therapy saying \\"My parents never thought I was good enough...\\" Or \\"I never really felt lived for who I was...\\"
B000002H2H|5.0|When I first started listening to Metallica, I worked backward from their best stuff.  I got the Black Album and absolutely loved it, then ...And Justice for All made me want more, and Master of Puppets became my favorite album. When I got Ride the Lightning, I had found a new favorite. This album kicks ass. <br /> <br />RTL starts off with Fight Fire with Fire, pure speed metal and rage that will send a chill down your spine. RTL's title track picks up where Fight... left off with 6 1/2 minutes of hardcore metal. The best song on the CD and my favorite Metallica song ever is For Whom the Bell Tolls. The bass (yes bass!) to open this song is phenomenal, and one can only wonder exactly how good Metallica would have been if Cliff Burton had not died in November 1986, God rest his metal soul. For Whom the Bell Tolls still brings a tear to my eye as I headbang to the awesome guitar and drums. The rest of the tracks are equally metal, and although Fade to Black might fool you at the beginning, it gets fast and heavy at the end. Even the instrumental Call of Ktulu is a killer song, and there is not one sour note played on any of the tracks. <br /> <br />Overall I give this album a 10 out of 10. It is perfect, and a must have for anyone who considers themselves a metal fan. Pick this one up!
B0007OY2MG|3.0|I love Gilmore Girls.  I watch it on DVD every night before I go to sleep.  This third season was so juice and wonderful.  Watching it gave me chills.  What I did not appreciate was the poorly constructed case.  The plastic that the disc are housed in is thin and was broken in the DVD that I got.  While this new packaging saves space and money, the shotty craftmanship will undoubtable ruin the DVDs if I leave them in there.  Buy the DVD, just be careful when you get them home.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|A great debate indeed. An exelent band essence is turned in a blast, some think it's positive, but i don't. It's not that I think the band has been badly influenced like some of you fans, I just think that Dream Theater was (at least for me) a leading ship, if you'd like, in the prog-metal fleet. After 'Train of Thought', it seems to me like the captain had decided to sail solo, backing away from everything he (or in this case We) knew like a real adventurist. Though sad, this situation is inevitable, Dream Theater is a free spirit and, as one, can innovate itself whenever its members would like. Some won't understand it, because of a silly fear of louder music, but Dream Theater music used to contain a great amount of feeling, a spirit if you'd like.The spirit that always existed in Dream Theater early creations has vanished lately. But as the song says \\"The spirit caries on\\". Influance from other albums like \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" \\"Falling To Infinity\\" \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" and the rest, had and would rest on other progressive artists, and even (hopefully) on Dream Theater members themselves. Dream Theaters' line up is still one of the most talented in the world today. Their contribute to the world of progressive metal and progressive music as a hole is huge and yet to be fully estimated. All of the members are great musitions with extraordiary skills and a huge amaunt of sole that sadly vanished lately, hopfully not for good. Anyway, I think it's the first time that reviews are more progressive than the album, if you know what I mean :) Im dissapointed- heavily
0452282152|5.0|I loved this book. It is head and shoulders above The Virgin Blue.  The writing was cleaner and the plot was deeper.  I wish I had had the chance to read the book before seeing the film, but the book is still a jewel unto itself. The relationship between the maid, Griet and her master, Vermeer, was so beautifully subtle, keeping you hungry, yet satisfied.  The tones are rich, yet earthy and authentic, and the characters are so real and alive I almost wish I could meet them.  She took a mysterious piece of art, and painted a gorgeous, and in some ways even magical history behind it. I found it to be a graceful piece, filled with beauty and depth that touched my heart.
B000002BQK|5.0|I remember this album when I was in the 5th grade. I played this album out. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. This album is full of such hopeful, uplifting moments, but it is equally infused with a deep sense of sadness and loss, as displayed on the album's numerous ballads which she sings of hiding her sadness from the world. Both joy and grief are explored on this album with equal tenacity. This album took her soaring to a new level of musical vision and artistry and promises to exceeds the achievements of her previous record, Daydream. This album has been certified 5x Platinum. Remember, this was 1997-1998.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|Nick Cave gave me the greatest concert experience I've ever had just a few years ago, with the \\"All-Star\\" lineup in tow - Blixa still on guitar, Warren Ellis on violin, and the opening act Neko Case and her Boyfriends. What a show! I've never felt so much blazing energy coming from a stage in my life - with Nick's hyper-charismatic ravings and the white-hot wailing of the Bad Seeds behind him, it was a downright religious experience. We were right in the palm of his hand, and he was squeezing. It was truth and beauty and death and literature and rocknroll and rapture and revelations all at once. When I got home, actually a little shaky from the experience, the albums I've had for years sounded comparatively tame. <br /> <br />Until now! This CD captures the power and majesty of the Nick Cave Experience(tm) like no studio piece since The Birthday Party. Though he has perhaps done better songs and perhaps made better albums along the way, I believe this is the most authentic rendition of the fury and wonder of the live experience in album form. <br /> <br />It's hard to believe that Nick hasn't recorded with a choir until now. It seems like a no-brainer in retrospect, and perhaps that's why he's avoided it. I can only think of a handful of rock songs that have used a church choir to powerful effect, and certainly not entire albums, but Cave has done it. And it seems to have reenergized him. Perhaps he is a performer that comes to life in collaboration and it may be that the recent configuration of the Bad Seeds has not been pushing him the way he needed. The choir, terrific singers by the way, are the perfect ingredient that ties it all together (kind of like the MacGarrigle sisters were a few albums ago, but moreso). <br /> <br />So - the albums. I find this to be more of a double-set than two seperate albums, but to play The Lyre of Orpheus immediately after Abbatoir Blues is actually quite jarring and left me cold to Lyre for several listens. They actually work better played in reverse order, with the wonderful O Children melting into the rampage of Get Ready For Love. I actually love all of the songs to different degrees on each play-through, and the albums together cover the full range of emotion to such a degree that leaves you exhausted after a full-attentioned listen.  <br /> <br />I do have to plead for a moritorium on Nick Cave writing songs having to do with animals. This must stop now. Of course it's part of the frustration of Cave that he can be often so brilliant and occassionally so clunky. In \\"No More Shall We Part\\", an otherwise gorgeous album, there was the infamous \\"the cow was brown\\" line (for which I threatened to kick him in the kneecaps in my review for the pure awfulness of it in an otherwise terrific song)... okay, the kitten motif was kind of endearing, but after this \\"Brown Ape\\" song, well, it must be stopped. There's actually a good tune under there. No more wildlife, Nick. Please. That's my only criticism, other than that I adore these albums and am terribly excited for the future of this band. Still putting out such great stuff after all these years!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is so cool. It is for fun! All you people who hate Eminem because he uses \\"vulgar language\\" and \\" is violent\\" are stupid. He just has a unique sense of humor. This album is for fun. It is entertaining to listen to. Thats it. If you don't like this type of music, just shut up about it and don't listen to it. <br />     <br />1. PSA 2000    <br />2.

0156027321|4.0|This is an engrossing and vivid book, beautifully written, with enough gentle fantasy to cushion (but not quite prepare you for) the cold slap of reality. I was enchanted with Pi, the child secretly studying to be a Hindu, a Muslim, and a Christian all at once, and I found the scene where three gurus representing those religions argue over his soul to be masterfully performed. But the most interesting and most vivid character, I'm sure most readers will agree, is by far Richard Parker. Having very little knowledge of Tigers myself to build upon, he was largely sculpted from scratch in my mind to become a huge presence in that tiny lifeboat where poor Pi was stranded, alone. Whatever you may believe about Pi's story, Richard Parker was almost certainly what kept him alive for seven months on the open sea. What the book says through this about survival and morality is very interesting.  <br /> <br />I find that the question of God, which does appear throughout the book, will be resolved in different ways depending on your spiritual perspective. I found that the story was a convincing example of the sustaining power of faith; however, the author's view of religion seems to me a somewhat cynical and despairing one, which may account for some reader's negative reactions. Perhaps it doesn't matter which of the two stories presented to the Japanese businessmen is \\"real\\". And perhaps faith is the way that we can construct meaning in our lives. But this leaves the actual existence of God as well as our individual choice of religion to be irrelevant, for as long as we create this meaning regardless of its \\"truth\\" it will be there to sustain us. This actually aligns pretty closely with my own worldview, so I loved the book for it. There are, however, other ways of creating meaning in one's life.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|He had me from the first note of Feeling Good!! <br /> <br />Buble has such a rich voice, perfect tonality and a delivery that is unmatched. I had read many comparisons of his style to other crooners but I believe he is unique. To be able to sing the variety of songs on this cd the way he does says to me that he has a confidence in his ability and he shines throughout. <br /> <br />I love his penned \\"Home\\", but I also found the duet with Nelly Furtado \\"Quando, Quando\\" to be so rich and warm -- this is music that allows me to feel each and every note. <br /> <br />So without going on and on, I can tell you Buble has delivered the goods and this cd is worth every cent. Suitable for all ages and tastes for anyone and everyone who appreciates good music!!!!
B00005KARK|5.0|What can I say that already hasn't been said about Dumbo?<br /><br />It's Disney's shortest animated movie.  However, it is also the most beautiful and tear jerking, bar none. Even a heart of stone would melt upon viewing Dumbo with his mother, especially the \\"Baby Mine\\" sequence.<br /><br />The art is breathtaking, soft, and for the most part, simple. However, it does have it's terrifying and scary moments, especially the \\"Pink Elephants On Parade\\" sequence.  Beautifully drawn, and yet, very Daliesque and scary.<br /><br />The story also contains some very politically incorrect images, but removing or re editing them would completely destroy the film.  Thank God Disney has not even tried.<br /><br />Besides, I look at it this way. The crows eventually befriended Dumbo, and give him encouragement instead of hate and negativity. Social outcasts embracing a social outcast.<br /><br />Dumbo is a triumph over adversity, not a racist statement.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I got this album the second day it came out in March.  I owned British Steel and Stained Class, to name a few, before this so I was a little worried that after 15 years since the last Judas Priest album with the classic lineup they might not deliver like they once did.  All my fears vanished when I heard \\"Judas Rising.\\"  This album is truly great,my personal favorites being \\"Judas Rising\\", \\"Demonizer\\", and \\"Hellrider\\", though all the tracks are solid. <br /> <br />The only exception would be \\"Worth Fighting For\\" wich, to me, is cheesy and kina' weak.  \\"Lochness\\" is a cool song, but moves too slowly.  \\"Angel\\", of course, is a beautiful song that really evokes a lot of emotion. <br /> <br />The DVD has the documentary, wich is not that interesting, but has some good live footage.   <br /> <br />This album is definatley a good buy for anyone into metal.  And everyone who gave this album a bad review can bugger off! <br /> <br />
B00000J7RZ|4.0|This album marks the one brief, shining moment where she could just have fun and do what came naturally (in both music and life).  No surprise that this is the most enjoyable J-Lo album by a tremendous margin.<br /><br />1. If You Had My Love - A nice, pretty ballad.  Probably the definitive J-Lo song.<br />2. Should've Never - On the sappy side, drags a bit, but nice 'n mellow nonetheless.<br />3. Too Late - Decent R&B fare.<br />4. Feelin' So Good - Okay collaborative effort; probably should've been a little livelier.<br />5. Let's Get Loud - Upbeat, sassy, highly dancable, I love it!<br />6. Could This Be Love - Another slow-paced one; prefer this to Should've Never<br />7/13. No Me Ames (two versions) - An interesting duet.  The voices complement each other very well.<br />8/14. Waiting For Tonight/Una Noche Mas - My favorites.  GREAT, entertaining dancepop.  Wish she'd done more of this.<br />9. Open Off My Love - More passable R&B; reminds me a lot of Willa Ford<br />10. Promise Me You'll Try - Don't really care for this one.  The note fluctuations sound just plain off.<br />11. It's Not That Serious - This is where I think she was mailing it in, as her voice sounds noticably worse than on almost any other track.<br />12. Talk About Us - Nice, romantic ballad.<br /><br />So there are highs and lows, but on the whole, this is a positive effort.  If only I could say the same for her career...
B00005K9LN|5.0|Compared to previous releases, this album is very simple a stripped down.  It's not as intricate and not as technically inclined as Sad Wings of Destiny or Stained Class.  But that is truly the beauty of this album.  It is raw, heavy, aggressive, and truly possesses an aura of power.  Do not listen to the fools who gave this album two star reviews, they would not know good metal if it blugeoned them over the head.  Buy it!  You'll like it!
B000003N8R|5.0|This masterful work is often overlooked because it came out so close to 'A Love Supreme,' which is probably Coltrane's greatest release.  This is also less experimental and free, but is still a great effort and belongs in anyone's Coltrane collection.  Also, I'd have to say McCoy Tyner really stands out on this record and this is one of the elements that really makes the music so amazing. <br /> <br />This album is a little less challenging that 'A Love Supreme' - I'd say it's pretty tame musically except for the title track, which begins with warm, hauntingly breathtaking playing from Trane.  It reminds me of the song 'Alabama' but half-way into the tune, the piano exits, allowing for more free improvisation reminiscent of 'A Love Supreme' before connecting perfectly back to the main theme. <br /> <br />'Wise One' is one of my all-time favorite Coltrane songs.  In Eric Nisenson's biography of him, it is stated this song is written for his first wife 'Naima' who he was no longer with when this came out.  There is another tribute to her on the 'Giant Steps' album.  The piano really sets the stage for this song from the beginning; Tyner plays a peaceful, stress-free part and then a few measures into it, Trane comes in.  What you get is a well-written piece with so much emotion in it, that the music takes you away to another mental reality. <br /> <br />'Bessie's Blues' is a hard swinging, finger snapping, foot tapping be-bop tune, clocking in at a brief three and a half minutes.  You get some classic playing from Tyner here. <br /> <br />'Lonnie's Lament' is another major highlight.  This goes back to the haunting tone we get from 'Wise One'; again we get top notch playing from Trane.  The main theme is a beautiful ballad full of long held notes that are played clear and strong throughout. Eventually, Trane bows out and we get a refreshingly soft jam from the rest of his group, with some more great piano. Garrison follows with a Mingus-style bass solo before the restof the band enters in.  A true epic of a piece - it clocks in at over eleven minutes! <br /> <br />On 'The Drum Thing' we get to hear more of Mr. Elvin Jones.  It sounds like mostly bass drums for the first couple minutes or so with Coltrane playing an arabian or indian style melody.  Jones begins to increase tempo and we go from mostly bass drums to a much quicker tempo and Elvin is all over the place!  I'd have to say this is one of my favorite Elvin Jones moments. <br /> <br />If you buy this album, you will not have to skip over any of the tracks.  I also think this album was what previous releases such as 'Blue Train' or 'Coltrane' wanted to be, but Trane had not developed his writing or performing techniques yet.
B000002U82|5.0|Whoever that kid is,quit blaming Pink Floyd for being talented. Pink Floyd rocks. Get this cd if youre a floyd fan or is into the 70`s.
B000063DI8|2.0|On this release, Iron Maiden wanted to go back to its roots of earlier records.  Apparently, this meant no more keyboards, as we had heard on 'Somewhere in Time' and 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son' - not a bad idea except for the fact that Adrian Smith was also gone, and was replaced by the less talented Janick Gers.  It's 2005 right now, and I still don't like Gers.  His solos are unoriginal and sloppy, and the only reason he landed a spot in Maiden is because he played on Bruce's first solo record, 'Tattooed Millionaire'.  His presence is one of the reason this only gets *2* stars from me. <br /> <br />Another reason is the songs just aren't that good.  'Hooks in You' is a great song, but it was written by Adrian Smith!  It is actually Chapter 3 of the 'Charlotte the Harlot' saga.  'Tailgunner' has some nice layered guitar work, but the concept is so corny.  These guys were really searching for song ideas!  The title track and 'Public Enema Number One' are okay, but when it comes to rubbish like 'Run Silent, Run Deep' and 'Mother Russia,' the band was obviously running out of ideas and were compensating with horribly written album fillers.   <br /> <br />I'd say make sure you buy this before you pick up any Blaze Bayley Maiden, but I recommend the followup to this release, 'Fear of the Dark' for a much more pleasurable listening experience.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album is a masterpiece! Screw the idiotic critics who call Bruce Springsteen \\"talented.\\" The only low point on the album is the rap in American Life, an otherwise good song. \\"Nothing Fails,\\" \\"Intervention,\\" and \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" are Madonna at her best.
B0007GAERG|4.0|ever since daydream was released I have been waiting for the next album by Mariah. but sadly (for me that is) her return to the music foray with butterfly was just pure dissapointing. I dunno wat was wrong. it was as if mariah just wasn't there. I mean the vocals were there and the power ballads were there but the oomph u get whenever u listened to a mariah record was just absent. her other records down the road just didn't do it for me. which was a sad thing. I guess it's dificult to live up to such great albums like music box and daydream. so the waiting went on... <br /> <br />then, along came The Emancipation of Mimi. gone are the whispery vocals (or at least toned down) that gets so darn irritating. it's as if she wants to sing but just can't get her voice out. <br /> <br />in Mimi, mariah just lets it all go and I'm hearing her beautiful vocals just like how it used to be. I am truly glad to be able to call myself a fan of Mariah Carey again. she was my first favourite female singer and the past few albums have been a dissapointment for me. call me unfaithful but when u don't like the music, there's nothing you can do. <br /> <br />All in all I'm glad Mariah made this record the way she did. can't wait for more music from this diva. I'm giving 4 stars cos I know she'll be producing greater stuff in the future!
0156027321|1.0|... to have finished this book.  Over and over again, I wanted to quit, but I kept thinking it would get better.  To say it is SLOW is like saying a slug is slow.  There were several scenes that were horrific & grotesque enough to make me gag.  There was absolutely nothing about it uplifting, entertaining or memorable.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME - more painful than dental work without anethesia.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|These guys are geniuses, but they're capable of better.  The movie was -- believe it or not -- BORING at times, and it could have used more jokes.  (Michael Moore strapping a bomb to himself and blowing up T.A. headquarters is technically not a joke.  It could have used an extra twist.)  The songs are funny, the politics are Parker and Stone's usual 14-year-old pseudo-nihilism, though they don't make ANY effort to lambast the right wing with the same tenacity that they do Tim Robbins and Sean Penn.  There wasn't a single f'ing rightwing celebrity blown apart in this movie (and yes, there are many), and I wanted to see the Sam Jackson puppet take a howitzer to little marionette versions of Trey Parker and Matt STone.  Now THAT would be a movie. <br /> <br />I also find it retarded that anyone could make a \\"satire\\" (their words, not mine) on the war on terror without even mentioning Bush.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Angel Of Retribution(2005). Judas Priest's fifteenth studio album.    2004 was a decent year for metal music thanks to some solid albums put out like Iced Earth's \\"The Glorious Burden\\", Evergrey's \\"Inner Circle\\" and many others. However, the year couldn't have ended any worse than with the murder of former Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell. It seemed like the world of heavy metal took a grave and bitter slump for a short while and it was looking for something to bring it back up again.    Thankfully some two months after the dawn of the newyear, the reunited metal gods Judas Priest did just that, unleashing a new powerhouse album that reminded fans how heavy metal was supposed to be done. I wanted to wait to review AOR until the excitement settled down because I knew that any review right off the bat to a new release by my all-time favorite heavy metal band would result in nothing but gushing praise. Thankfully, even after a while, AOR holds up because it's really A GOOD ALBUM. Those that are looking for something completely new and different won't care for this release as many of the 1-2 star reviews will indicate. True, Priest aren't really being that innovative here like they were in 1984 and prior, but thankfully they are not trying to imitate the trend of the day anymore (Let's face it, ever since Turbo(1986), Priest has been playing catch-up to what was popular in the metal music scene, even Painkiller(1990) which I consider a masterpiece). AOR is simply Priest taking all the best elements of each of their past albums that define what Priest is all about and compacting them into a classic, yet non-dated album. Think of it as a Best of Priest collection, but with all new songs.    Now Priest's reunion isn't exactly new news anymore, but disregarding the time span of Halford's absence which was almost as long as their whole previous career combined, it appears that almost nothing has changed since 1991. His presence further proves that the two Ripper-era albumsJugulator(1997) and Demolition(2001) were merely Tipton solo albums with the Priest name attached, and it can be felt all over the songwriting and lyrics. Speaking of which, every previous album contributes something to the whole package here whether it be lyrical references or the song itself. People tend to dog on Priest for their fantasy comic book lyrics, but they fit the music just fine, so get over it.    Onto the songs. The selection here is so diverse that every song has a different feel to it from the previous one, not unlike the 70s and 80s Priest albums, and something that many metal bands sorely lack in. Kicking off is the pulse-pounding 'Judas Rising', perhaps the only song displaying some new territory. Easily the best album opener since Painkiller, or at least since Halford's \\"Resurrection\\". This one will be a classic for years to come. Next is 'Deal With The Devil', a metal scorcher bearing resemblance to both 'Riding On The Wind' and Halford's 'Made In Hell'. 'Revolution' is the lone single that was released, and one that many fans seem to hate. Yes, it's not exactly in league with many of the other tracks here, but it's definitely stronger than some of the singles released off of past albums. A true anthem with a bit of a 'Take On The World' and 'United' sound and pace to it. 'Worth Fighting For' brings Point Of Entry(1981) to mind. Then the frantic 'Demonizer' conjures up what Priest should have sounded like if Halford had sung on Jugulator songs like 'Bullet Train'.     'Wheels Of Fire' comes off as a cruising commercial rocker in the vein of Turbo, minus the glossy 80s production. 'Angel' is an outstanding ballad, and perhaps up there with 'Beyond The Realms Of Death'. People have been complaining over the numerous slower songs and less frequent falsetto screams, but if you listen to some of the earlier Priest albums besides Painkiller, they follow a similar pattern to AOR. Painkiller fans should rejoice for 'Hellrider', a mammoth speed metal track that rolls and brings all the best elements of that album together, sounding the most like the title track and `Between The Hammer And The Anvil'. It's my favorite one besides 'Judas Rising', containing two choruses, plus a killer twin guitar attack that is on the level of the solos found on 'One Shot At Glory'. Glen and KK definitely haven't lost their edge. 'Eulogy' is a brief 'Epitaph' inspired piece. Last but not least is 'Lochness', AOR's slow plodding closer like 'Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith' or 'Monsters Of Rock', though 'Lochness' is certainly the best of those kind of tracks they've ever made, and their longest song to date. It builds up for a while and escalates into a stellar chorus with a giant hook. Rock hard ride free!    Replayability: High. It's essential Priest, need I say more?    The DVD is interesting to watch, if nothing more than that, but overall I'd say that Priest managed to pull of a successful reunion and AOR cements them as the rightful metalgods, announcing that Priest is in fact here to stay. I still like Defenders Of The Faith(1984), Unleashed In The East(1979), and Painkiller the best, but AOR is now another one of my favorites, definitely in the top 5 Priest albums. There wasn't a single song that I didn't like on here, so I have no reason not to give it the full 5 stars it deserves. It's too soon to tell, but in a few years down the road, AOR will become a classic. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL FANS OF THE MIGHTY PRIEST!    Other recommendations:  -Any Priest album, minus 'Rocka Rolla' and the Ripper albums.  -Any 80s and new millenium Iron Maiden album.
B000002KXO|4.0|This CD found the Mac trying to steer back towards a more commercial sound after the musical adventure of \\"Tusk\\". It's not \\"Rumours, Part 2\\"...it would be far too difficult to live up to that achievement. But it is solidly listenable with no resolute clunkers, making it better than average among their catalogue.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />I'll agree with what seems to be the consensus that \\"Gypsy\\" is the most realized track on here, an absolutely gorgeous track and lyric. But outside of that tune, most of the best bits on the CD belong to Christine Mcvie. Her \\"Hold Me\\" was the album's other big hit. She also turned in the dreamy \\"Only Over You\\" and closes it with her wistful \\"Wish You Were Here\\". Other standouts are Lindsey's 50s tribute \\"Oh Diane\\" (a hit in Europe for FM) and his percolating \\"Can't Go Back\\".<br /><br />LOWS:<br />Stevie's \\"That's Alright\\" and Lindsay's \\"Empire State\\" aren't BAD but they are somewhat mediocre. They're the valleys of the album.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />For fans just getting into the Mac, I would probably buy this 3rd, after RUMOURS and the \\"WHITE ALBUM\\" (1975's self-titled debut of the Nicks-Buckingham lineup). After this, the fortunes of the Mac would begin to wane...
B000929AJQ|5.0|I've been a nin fan since '94 I heard this cd online in iits entirety and did not like it, at first.  It wasn't what I was used to from NIN but I liked two songs enough to give the cd a shot.  All the love in the world and Only. They just stuck in my mind.  I bought the cd despite it hoping the songs would grow on me, and they did.  I don't know how but I'd have some of the drum lines from songs I didn't like going through my head and I just had to hear these songs again.  All of a sudden I'm listening to Sunspots then Every Day is Exactly the Same.  And each time I liked the cd more and more.  The production is top notch as always with Trent Reznor.  I'm sure you've done it before. You heard a cd and didn't think it was special, but then it just starts growing on you.  Those cd's end up being the ones you listen to for a long time.  This is one of those cd's.  I'm putting it up there as another great cd by one of the most creative artist in music.  To really appreciate how great the cd is listen to it with headphones on, alone.  You'll see.
B000002UAI|3.0|Beatlemania, with its non-stop touring and press schmoozing...the added pressure of their newly launched movie careers..and EMI/Capitol label bigwigs demanding \\"something new for the Christmas season\\" all conspired to wreck this album. While it's clearly the Beatles' worst effort, the fact that they pulled something even this listenable out of it shows what huge talent the Fabs had.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />\\"Eight Days A Week\\", with its fadein intro and ringing guitars, is easily the standout track here and a classic in the Beatles canon. Paul turns in the gorgeous \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\". \\"I'm a Loser\\" and \\"Baby's in Black\\" are hummable, if a bit lightweight. Everything gets spotty after that. Of the covers (6 turn up), the best ones are John's snarling take on \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" which stands alongside Chuck Berry's and \\"Kansas City/Hey Hey Hey\\". George Martin does a good job of capturing the Sun Records \\"slapback\\" echo for George's vocal on \\"Everybody's Trying to be My baby\\" but George's vocal's a bit lacking.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />Ringo seems to sleepwalk through what SHOULD be a snarling vocal on \\"Honey Don't\\" (a delivery like John Lennon does on \\"Run for your Life\\" would have been more a propos to the song). \\"Words of Love\\" is dull...it's better remembered in Buddy Holly's version. \\"What You're Doing\\" never fully kicks in (The potential in the song would be better extracted in a Yes cover years later.)<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The Beatles are not at their best here. If you're looking for an \\"early years\\" Beatles album, consider A HARD DAY'S NIGHT or HELP! first.
B0008ISM40|5.0|Trent Reznor is notable for, among other things, making the keyboard a sexy and powerful instrument. This album features a much more stripped down approach to music production, and, in that vein, is similar sounding to Pretty Hate Machine. But With Teeth is much more advanced than Pretty Hate Machine; he uses all the experience he's gained in the past fifteen years to inform a much more minimal record, and the results are fabulous. He's discovered that he can write solid songs without layering hundreds of tracks on top of each other. That being said, there are still many trademark NIN sounds present here, with lots of noisy percussion and grating synths, though the synths are generally not as gussied up as on previous records.  <br /> <br />The first thing that sprung to mind as I listened to the album was how funky it is, and how beat oriented it is. Harmonically it's a very simple album (the verse in The Line Begins to Blur, for example, consists of one note played over and over), but rhythmically it's as ambitious as anything Reznor's done in the past. The Collector, for example, has a 6/8 verse with an extra beat kicked in every other bar, while the chorus alternates between 4/4 and 6/8. This may sound too complicated for pop, but Reznor knows what he's doing, and by putting the album's most straight-forward song, The Hand That Feeds, after The Collector, he provides relief for those who may have found the bizarre rhythms disorienting. The effect of this is that The Collector ends up sounding mroe unique and The Hand That Feeds sounds less frivolous. A similar transition occurs between With Teeth and Only, and the flow of the album as a whole is very well thought out.  <br /> <br />And, in describing the sound of the album, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my favorite track, Beside You In Time. The song sweats anticipation, the melodious vocals playing juicily against the dissonances in the synthesizer. When the vocals and the drums drop out, leaving only the numbingly wide synth, it leaves me feeling like I'm floating in space, blinded by something beautiful. When the end section finally arrives, we are treated to a beautiful serenade from Reznor, pulling all the strings on the heart. This is one of the best Nine Inch Nails songs you've ever heard. <br /> <br />I've only had time to listen to the album 15 or so times since its release, and haven't really gotten to listen too closely to the lyrics or look for common threads. Reznor's voice has certainly improved, or, at least, the scope of things he's willing to do with his voice has broadened. As always, the lyrics, like the music, are simple in small parts, but the whole begins to say something profound. The lyrics to the last song, Right Where It Belongs, are new territory for Nine Inch Nails, perhaps aided by Reznor's experience in Alcoholics Anonymous; they seem to take something from group therapy. As always the lyrics are impassioned enough to make you feel a strong connection, but vague enough for the songs to apply to a broad range of things. There's also some self-referential stuff, such as the Down In It reference in Only (which will, accompanied by its David Fincher video, annihilate the airwaves this summer).  <br /> <br />In an era when high school kids seem to have a greater appreciation for rock and punk music of the seventies and eighties, perhaps this album falls into the zeitgeist, recalling, with its heavy use of monophonic analog synthesizers, early electronic pop. The soon-to-be-single, Only, takes the best of Michael Jackson and Prince and gives it that signature Nine Inch Nails sound. This is a vibrant album, pulsing with more energy than any other Nine Inch Nails record. If you hop on for the ride, it'll swing you around at a thousand miles an hour. Whatever else this album is, it's a thrilling statement of vitality from a man who hasn't done much of anything in five years. Call me gullible, but when he says there'll be another album soon, I actually believe him. Also, be sure to check out the artwork available online. Truly an ingenious step in album presentation.
B0007TKNII|4.0|Phantom has never been my favorite Broadway Show (I liked Jeckyl and Hyde), since I found the repeat of songs and themes in Phantom to get monotonous after awhile...... however...I like this movie adaption better than any of the stage shows I have seen.<br /><br />Newcomer Emmy Bossum is a REAL TALENT.<br /><br />If she can grow up with a level head and avoid the pitfalls of Hollywood, she can be great as she grows up.<br /><br />Her vocal talents were PHENOMENAL.<br /><br />Only criticisms, which are minor..... the film was a bit long and dragged at one point and the casting of the Phantom himself was the weakest casting as his vocal abilities were not up to par to the other performers............. However, all in all an excellent job done bringing this to the screen.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Horrible can't describe this movie in a right light. This was the worse film I have seen in years and this should prove once and for all on how bad Keanu Reeves is as an actor because he's at his worse in this film. He's so bad that he has the uncanny ability to make you feel stupid once the movie is over, that's how bad he is. The script is a huge mess and most of it does not make sense what so ever and the picture is way too dark in certain areas of the film.  Rachel Weisz is great in the movie but she's basically carrying Keanu on her shoulders during most of the film while he over acts in horrific ways and she is stranded with a story that really should have had a good rewrite before it became a shooting script.  Other than her, the movie is just a huge help of crap that should not have been made.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why did the Network sabatoge this show by forcing Joss Whedon to show the episodes out of order? Watching the show the way it was meant to be seen left me feeling that they were either stupid or they wanted the show to fail.<br /><br />At any rate, the show is just as good as Buffy, though it is entirely different. Each character is unique and has a story that only partially unfolds in this partial season. The series is part science fiction and part western, but even if you are not drawn to either of these genres you can enjoy it's wonderful storytelling.<br /><br />I can't wait for the movie!
B000089CPF|1.0|I purchased this disc both on the glowing recommendations on this site and because of a particularly catchy song from a soundtrack.  While the soundtrack song is on here, the rest of the disc stole all the energy and magic and I have distaste now for the one song I liked.  I'm not sure what I was expecting but it wasn't this.  The songs drag and are depressing.  They lack creativity and there's no spark that goes along with music coming from people who really enjoy crafting music.  Take time to listen to the samples before buying.  I didn't and regret it.  (Please purchase mine used above:).  Thanks.
0618526412|5.0|I read this book over one year ago- and I still cannot get the characters out of my head. McCullers succeeds in depicting people whose basic loneliness is something that the modern day reader can relate to on every level. The main character is a deaf mute, and this reflects the plight that all of us feel at one time or other- when our truest emotions cannot be felt or understood by those most dear to us. Her writing is simple, but profound. I am absolutely hooked on Carson McCullers, and have gone on to read every one of her works. This is American literature at its best!
6303695205|5.0|I love this tape, The moves are not that hard and they work wonders, after only a couple of weeks I see and feel the results.The instructor has a great was of easing you thru the excercises and you feel great at the end, I am ordering a spare copy just in case something happens to my current copy, the only other leg workout tape that gives such wonderful results is the cher fitness tape , I highly recommend that one also
1559279311|1.0|I have listened to many audio books, and this is the first that I've listened to that has been read by the author.  This CD is an example of why most books are read by professionals.  Michael Cunningham delivers his prose in a manner that sounds very affected- pausing at frequent intervals to perhaps emphasize importance, ending nearly every sentence with a vaguely questioning, melancholy inflection.  It is nearly impossible to sit through the almost ten hours of his reading.  The writing is exceptional, but his reading of it is so pretentious and distracting, that it is almost too excruciating to listen to.
0446677450|1.0|I'd not give it a star at all if the system allows me to. Read on and you will find out: he became rich by telling people and making them believe HE can make them rich. What a cheat!    (...)
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums of 2004.  The musical talent of this group is far and away some of the most impressive to come out of Canada in the last few years.  Gone finally are the tired days of Our Lady Peace and Default.  Goodbye awful late-90s rock groups. Hello new-age brilliance.  Rock music is alive again, and it's bands like the Arcade Fire that give listeners hope for a resurgence in beautiful lyrics and cascading melodies.  'Funeral' is the best album I've heard since Bloc Party's 'Silent Alarm', and anyone with any sort of taste should own this album. <BR>What is also great about the Arcade Fire is that, along with bands like Stars, Montreal is becomming a hub for great music.  Without sounding too terribly soppy, bands like the Arcade Fire reflect their roots, and finally Montreal is cool again!  And this coming from a Calgarian.<BR>Please support great Canadian music.  Buy this album!
B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration is one of those timeless albums that should put The Cure in the history books, alongside such groups as Led Zeppelin or the Beatles. It is that pinnacle masterpiece that can never be duplicated, only succeded. (Though its complete revisitation in the Trilogy DVD came remarkably close, and its inclusion in that ambitious set was an accomplishment that makes me envy all who could attend the live show.) <br /> <br />It has the rare combination of both excellent individual tracks, every one of them memorable and standing strong by itself, and excellent arrangement, all the more empowered by transitions that further strenghten this album, making it one of the most emotional listening experiences of all time. <br /> <br />It grabs you from the very beginning, starting with \\"Plainsong's\\" haunting wind chimes followed by a crashing pulse of layered sound, before leading in to \\"Pictures of You,\\" the first of a number of tracks that build on the emergent elegance of the previous album's \\"Just Like Heaven.\\" <br /> <br />The album then alternates back and forth throughout its first half between more radio-friendly tracks like \\"Pictures of You\\" and \\"Lullaby\\" and more esoteric pieces like \\"Closedown\\" and \\"Last Dance,\\" slowly building up through \\"Fascination Street\\" and leading into the emotional journey of the second half. <br /> <br />Disintegration defies the convention of typical album arrangements, instead leading each song into the next through a carefully constructed transition, often times pairing two songs together for a single combined emotional statement. This is particularly true when it immerses you through \\"Prayers for Rain\\" and \\"The Same Deep Waters as You,\\" which pull the album further away from convention and deeply into another realm. <br /> <br />The album then peaks with its title track, which is one of the most powerful Cure songs ever released. <br /> <br />Then the album even has the grace to help you ground, with the last two songs, which transition you through a somber afterglow. <br /> <br />Strangely enough, The Cure is uncharacteristically kinder to CD fans than fans of other formats in this case, omitting two tracks on the LP version. Subsequent albums over the next several years would short-change their CD releases for awhile. In any case, Disintegration's overall length alone in excess of 70 minutes in CD form, a decade before long albums were trendy. <br /> <br />For many of you, this is the album that made you a Cure fan. If you don't already have it, it belongs in your library, just as it belongs in the history books.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|Normally I hate to unjustly compare two bands, because I can think of nothing more irritating then to be pigeon held by what my predecessor has done. However, with that said, Theory of a deadman is to similar to Nickelback to be ignored. If you don't like the sound of Nickelback, then this album isn't for you, plain and simple. Every song has the same formulaic construction that Nickelback has made it's calling card. What is nice about this album is Tyler's voice has a bit more edge then Chad's. This album is very listenable, with very catchy hooks. I still have to give the edge to the self titled album, simply for the fact that this album does not have any of the definite singles that the first one had. There just isn't any topping \\"leg to stand on\\" or \\"Invisible man\\". If you are just learning about this band for the first time, I think I would recommend the first album over this one just because it's cheaper. I'm not sure whether or not it deserves the five star rating I gave it, there is nothing superior here, it's just so damn catchy it's hard to give it anything less. Thank you for your time.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I truly belive that Keanu has found his calling...I love him as the quiet, robotic (in speech & movement), superhero type.  The Matrix movies plus Constantine really have proven this fact for me.  I think he is a \\"different\\" kind of actor & he seems to do well in these roles.  The movie is funny and dark...I love both!  Keanu looks fantastic...that makes it even better to watch!  I think it was a great movie!  It is not 5 stars because I can only hold that type of rating for movies like The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
B0007GAERG|4.0|As hotly anticipated as this album is, I decided to hold off and listen to the album several times before reviewing it in order to give a fair judgement.  Well several times has led to never leaving my stereo.  The album is her best in years since \\"Daydream\\".  Having grown away from her most recent music, it was a great surprise to hear the bangin \\"It's Like That\\" on the radio; and made me wonder if this was just a shot in the pan.  Turns out \\"That\\" is only the beginning... <br />   \\"We Belong Together\\" will send shivers up your spine and have you wishing the song was longer.  She sounds so relaxed singing with such great ease and holding those high notes.  \\"Shake It Off\\", a carefree, breezy song leading into \\"Mine Again\\", perhaps a bonus track off 'Music Box', where this diva showcases her multi-octave vocals perfectly.  <br />   This leads into the best stretch for hopeful singles.  Songs 5  through 10 should all be commercially released, each distinctive but so damn catchy!  \\"Say Something\\", with Snoop Dogg, is yet another killer Neptunes-produced track.  \\"Stay the Night\\" (2nd favorite song on album), a soon-to-be-r+b classic; \\"Get Your Number\\" aka \\"It's Like That, pt2\\". My favorite song on the album is song 8 \\"One and Only\\", where she not only sings, but basically sings rapping holding her own against speed rapper Twista.  R+B radio will love motown-tinged gems \\"Circles\\", \\"Your Girl\\", \\"I Wish You Knew\\".  Nelly livens things back up with \\"To the Floor\\".  Closing thigs out are mid-tempo numbers, \\"Joyride\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird\\".   <br />   The album deserves 4 & 3/4 stars but I couldnt quite manage it on the ratings system.  Despite the news reports in the past, I must agree with the media stating, \\"The Voice Is BACK!\\"
0689835604|5.0|I found this to be the best of the Karen Katz books I bought. Nathan loves seeing the baby in the book unveil the same body parts as the ones he's pointing to on himself! It really helped him get a handle on eyes, mouth, etc. <br />Great book.
B000089CJI|5.0|...on an airplane, I mean.  The first three songs are an amazing triumervate.  More soul searching than anything Death Cab for Cutie has put out so far.
B000002X1O|4.0|Grace Slick and Paul Kantner--along with various members of their extended musical entourage--recorded several little-known, but really great records in the early '70s on their way from Jefferson Airplane to Jefferson Starship (n.b. Dragonfly has their names on the cover). Sunfighter (1971) is the first, but Baron von Tollbooth (despite the overly-whimsical title) is a stunning collection of songs that feature some of Slick best writing ever. Her contributions range from the highly melodic \\"Fat\\" to the imperious and bracingly-delivered \\"Across the Board.\\"  \\"Sketches of China\\" is a great song, mobilizing each band member's skills nearly perfectly. Kantner and Slick always generously gave over space on their records to their collaborators--with almost uniformly bad results and here, Friedberg's token track is one big New Left platitude after another. Overall, the album has a beautiful, deep sound, and Slick's vocals are particularly crisp and set off strikingly. And who ever missed the hystrionics of Marty Balin?
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Hey! <br /> <br />The OC is just the best tv show ever made. I am not that kind of person who enjoys this kind of movie, and when I first heard it, I thought it was just one of those teen shows. I was proven wrong. It is so addicting!! <br />I enjoy OC season 1, and I'll surely enjoy season 2. I haven't seen it yet (they don't have the OC over here, have to buy dvds, it's so mad), and I'm so happy the dvd is coming out. Can't wait until August 23rd
B00006AW2J|5.0|There is not even anything i can compare to the rolling stones, especially this cd. definatly one of my favorites. I would reccomend sympathy for the devil any day. just awesome.
B00005OAE6|5.0|I loved these tunes when they were on album &lt;LP if you will> so the music was never a question. The Cd was however as some come out tinny when reproduced. This one is not!   <br /> <br />The music is excellent and keeps me at 120lbs.   I don't think I'll see a concert soon so this is the best I can get.
B0007O38F8|4.0|Since 50 didn't get shot 9 times between the time he began writing lyrics for this album... 50 had to resort to talking about being in the clubs once again... and how girls should pleasure him... and several songs about how he's gonna put holes in people... and another diss record... the bright spot on this album is the tracks that back up 50's meaningless lyrics... &quot;Just A Lil' Bit&quot;, &quot;Candy Shop&quot;, &quot;Get In my Car&quot;, are probably the standout tracks on this album... personally... i actually like this album... for the beats... but there is absolutely nothing insightful for those of you who like people like Nas, Mos Def, and etc...
B000002J03|5.0|This a classic album and probably zeppelins second best album. Jimmy Pages riffing and soloing in this album is superb, although most of it is probably to the credit of some old blues heroes. Heres what I think of the songs.    1.Whole Lotta Love (5/5)- Classic song, great solo  2.What Is And What Should Never Be (4.5/5)-Nice smooth jazzy beat breaking off into a catchy rocking chorus  3.The Lemon Song (Squeeze My Lemon) (3.5/5)-Good Blues song about sex, try and guess what the lemon is supposed to be  4.Thank You (5/5)-Hugely underated love song, this is a total classic  5.Heartbreaker (5/5)-A blues rock riff but the solo is total Metal  6.Living Loving Maid (Shes Just A Woman) (5/5)-Extremely Catchy  7.Ramble On (5/5)-great acoustic rocker about The Lord Of The Rings  8.Moby Dick (4/5)- an artsy drum solo  9.Bring It On Home (3.5/5)-Originally by Willie Dixon    If you like classic or blues based Rock buy this album. If youre a metal fan listen to the album.    If you enjoyed this album youll probably also like:  Cream-Disraelli Gears  Jeff Beck-Beck-Ola  Mott The Hoople-Mott The Hoople
B0007OCG4W|2.0|I think everyone should see this movie at least once since the character studies are at least partway interesting even if the characters never grow or display soul and passion but I certainly would not buy this on dvd. It is a pretentious, \\"arthouse\\" drama that gives one a good lesson on what sort of people to avoid when looking for love. All four characters are hateful, aimless, passionless, spiteful and pathetically immature, so much so that it gave me a headache. The dialogue is a little too, too....proper? No one speaks the way these people do in real life. And only idiots would continually hurt each other among the same stale group of people over and over again with constant deception, lies, infidelities and viciousness. Natalie Portman's character, interestingly the youngest one, seems to be the only one that outgrew the circle of stupidity in the end. The only really interesting character was Clive Owens character. His phisical presence, raw maleness, honesty and emotional brutality stood out like a shining light in an otherwise dismal and pointless film.
B0008ISM40|5.0|I'm a long time NIN fan (but not a fanatic, just enjoy Trent's style) I eagerly awaited \\"With Teeth\\", especially since I've played my copy of The Fragile weekly for the past few years.  I think the laser in the car cd player has wore a groove into the discs.  lol <br /> <br />On first listen I liked some of the more techno attitude he chose on some of the tracks.  Often times reminded me of Radiohead's spin on techno rock.  But on a whole it wasn't as angry as previous works.  And it occurred to me he's hitting like 40 years old now, and has a few million bucks in the bank... so why would he be as angry as when he released, say, \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\"? <br /> <br />Since then I've been playing it compulsively and have grown to appreciate the entire album (even \\"The Hand That Feeds\\", which kinda spelled doom for me when I heard it on pre-release).  Moody songs like \\"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\\" and \\"Beside You In Time\\" seem bent on jerking a tear, while he still can bust out some awesome industrial tone with tracks like \\"You Know What You Are?\\" . <br /> <br />So why the hell would he make another \\"The Fragile\\"?  Why would he want to?  Funny, I heard the same criticism of \\"The Fragile\\" not sounding like \\"The Downward Spiral\\" when it was first released.  I even held off buying Fragile for a few years because so many of my NIN listening buddies just 'didn't get it'.  Well, I'm learning to rely on more than a few musician friends when picking new albums to buy.  I'm glad I bought \\"With Teeth\\" and have been recommending it to friends.  I hope he sells a 100 million copies, the more NIN that spins the better the world would turn. <br /> <br />In conclusion I think it would be nice to note that the 5.1 DVD Audio mix is really nice, maybe one of the better ones I've heard yet (I have quite a DVD Audio collection).  The best is still ELP's \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\", but \\"With Teeth\\" comes in a close second.  Third is the remixed DVD Audio of \\"The Downward Spiral\\", so Trent really know's his stuff when it comes to filling a room with his sound.
B00000JQFM|5.0|This is a fantastic guitar rock album (without vocals) by one of the greatest players in the world.  Sure, there's a lot of flat out shredding, but there's also some haunting, beautiful music to be found here as well.  \\"Surfing With The Alien\\" is the song that got me hooked on his music.  It flat out rocks, as does \\"Satch Boogie\\" (sounds kind of like ZZTop's La Grange, only faster).  \\"Crushing Day\\" is definetely one of my favorites.  It's a fantastic song.  \\"Circles\\" starts out as a slow, beautiful, haunting, but catchy, song, turns into rock, and goes back to slow and haunting.  \\"Always With Me...\\" is a nice ballad, but I prefer \\"Starry Night\\" (which is on a different album, but can be found on his Electric Anthology two disc set) to this.  \\"Ice 9\\" is a good rocker, but it pales slightly to the others.  \\"Midnight\\" is a fine example of beautiful, haunting guitar work.  \\"Echo\\", \\"Lords Of Karma\\", and \\"Hill Of The Skull\\" are at the lower end.  The main slow riff of \\"Echo\\" sounds remarkably like something I've heard in one of the towns of Final Fantasy VIII.     Overall, if you're a classic rock fan or a guitar player in general, you'll love this album.  But there's more out there to hear.  My favorite Satriani songs of all time would be:     Lights Of Heaven    Starry Night   Crushing Day   Circles   Borg Sex   Summer Song   The Speed Of Light   Surfing With The Alien   If I Could Fly   Satch Boogie
B00005JL0U|5.0|I want Moonwalker on DVD!!! Please, pretty please it must be released on DVD for REGION 1.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Trey Parker and Matt Stone are two overlooked geniuses. They use surface innocence to convey biting satires, political messages, and yes some bathroom humor. Their South Park series is one of my favorite shows of all time. I don't think there is one unsatisfactory episode to me, and when they came out with that movie, I again was not dissappointed. In fact I never loved the series or the characters more. Then, i heard their new plan. To use another representation of innocence, puppets, and completely tear things apart. From the first preview I was highly anticipating the movie, and I went into the movie and basically cried for an hour or so I was laughing so hard. This is easily one of the funniest movies i have seen (for reference, other movies i find funny are: shrek, austin powers 1-2, monty python anything, finding nemo, and anything witty).  <br /> <br />So why the four stars instead of the 5? well, as much i love the tastelessness of the Dynamic Duo, they sometimes carry it to levels in this movie that aren't just unfunny, but unnecessary to the whole of the movie. Usually everything has some type of purpose, but there was a lot of unnecessary jokes and scenes where i was left wondering why did i just see that. <br /> <br />But overall my reccomendation is to watch it, as long as you aren't some uptight person who can't laugh at something. Keep in mind that it is not too offensive in my eyes because they make fun of everyone. All races, religions, political beliefs: nothing is safe. And i think that is the best thing they can do
B0000CDLA7|1.0|see below- i was thinking about doing that lol- try symphony x- or adagio, redemption, pagan's mind- stay clear of this \\"prog\\" album-- haha
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis Presley-30 #1 hits spans from 1956 recordings such as heartbreak hotel, to 1977 recordings such as Way Down. As well as all of elvis's 30 number 1 hits their is a bonus track a little less conversation(JKL Radio Edit Remix) which is good expesically for the true elvis fan who already has all of the 30 number one hits in their collection. This CD takes you through a journey in a sense from the early times, to the 60's, through the 70's showing you the example of why Elvis was the king of rock n roll. Songs like Suspicious Minds, and Heartbreak Hotel stick with Elvis fans as well as the 28 others from all shook up, surrender, crying in the chapel, the wonder of you, stuck on you, burning love, don't, and countless others. I would also like to mention how great the booklet inside the CD case is. Their are some great rare pictures in the booklet as well as some great quotes by the king himself including this one \\"Rhythem Is Something You Either Have Or Done Have, But When You Have It, You Have It All Over.\\" Not to mention how great elvis was but also to all of the musicians who were on this CD because they were elvis's backbone throughout his entire career. I would HIGHLY RECOMEND this to everybody in the world including YOU! Because you will learn to love this entire collection as much as any other possible recording in your entire collection. Enjoy~ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I SMELL MONEY!!!!!!!!<br /><br />probably DT are giving to funs what they think they want to make more money.. and they were right, look how many five stars. Have you ever thought a solo from Petrucci could be just 3 million notes in a second and no emotion? Have you ever wanted a DT album with no keyboard? Do you want to hear La Brie being a rapper? Songs with no heart (stream of consciousness is the exception) never ending... this is no progressive, nothing but showing-off technical heavy stuff. boring, sometimes annoying. copying here and there from NU-metal
B00064MW6A|2.0|Well, I rented it for the same reason as any other red-blooded American male....to see Halle Berry in next to nothing.  As expected, that was the best part of it.  For the most part, the movie itself bored me to death.  As a lame bonus, it had that weird, lispy, French guy from the Matrix that I hate.  I like comic book/superhore movies as a rule, but this one I could take or leave.  Why didn't Halle just be someone like, \\"NakedGirl\\", or \\"Showerwoman\\"? <br /> <br />Ha ha ha, I crack myself up.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|In 1981 all was not well in the world of the mighty VH. Tensions between guitarist Eddie Van Halen and singer David Lee Roth had been mounting, and it got to the point where Eddie had wanted to quit the group. He recorded music, possibly for a solo album, Roth heard it, and promptly wrote some lyrics--the result...FAIR WARNING. A rather, dark, cynical album, and one of the finest, if not finest, recording Van Halen ever made. The tensions within the band helped to fuel the fire, the intensity, and the passion of the recording process.<br /><br />With the exception of Van Halen 3, (with vocalist Gary Cherone) \\"Fair Warning\\" was the least commercially successful Van Halen album. Although it is generally regarded among fans (especially VH purists) to be one of the bands' best albums.<br /><br />Although still a \\"party\\" album, complete with sing-along choruses, \\"Fair Warning\\" is by far the band's darkest album. The overall vibe of the album, as well as Eddie Van Halen's riffs and solos, while undeniably catchy with great hooks, also have a cloudy somberness to them. David Lee Roth's lyrics, for the most part, are also somewhat more cynical than most of his work, before or since.<br /><br />\\"Fair Warning\\" shows Van Halen at their zenith. Truth be told--the first six Van Halen albums are all masterpieces and essential to any great rock collection, but \\"Fair Warning\\" is the crown jewel of VH's output. Even more so than the classic debut album. \\"Fair Warning\\" simply shows each member of the band, and the band overall as a unit, at their finest. \\"Fair Warning\\" demonstrates Eddie Van Halen's best riffs, solos, and overall playing. It's flashy, yet not self-indulgent, intense, yet also has a lot of soul, something that a lot of technical wizards lack. It was on \\"Fair Warning\\" that Eddie found the \\"brown sound.\\"<br /><br />\\"Fair Warning\\" is also singer David Lee Roth's finest hour. His lyrics and delivery are at their most witty, ironic and colorful height--like in the classic \\"one break, commmming uppp!\\"--from \\"Unchained\\" (which was on the spur-of-the-moment, and not pre-planned). On \\"Fair Warning,\\" David Lee Roth is immortalized as the world's coolest frontman, ever.<br /><br />\\"Fair Warning\\" also shows Van Halen's rhythm section at their best. Bassist Michael Anthony has never been hailed as the world's greatest living bassist. He is primly there to serve, along with drummer Alex Van Halen as the musical backbone of the band, to let Eddie do his thing. On \\"Fair Warning,\\" although his lines are pretty straightforward, they are also right upfront. You can hear the bass throughout the entire disc, it really stands out and enhances the sound and vibe of the album overall. On songs like \\"Push Comes to Shove\\" and \\"So This is Love,\\" you can get into the bass as much as any other aspect of the sound.<br /><br />\\"Mean Street\\" opens with the sound of a guitar--quite at first, and then getting louder and louder--of Eddie noodling on the fretboard. And then the main riff kicks in, a mean, killer riff, one of 80s rocks' finest. At this point you are thrust into the all-consuming greatness that is classic Van Halen. This mid-tempo rocker simply shows classic Van Halen at their best--young, invigorated, ready to kill. \\"Fair Warning\\" then moves into the dark, highly underrated \\"Dirty Movies.\\" This song starts out melodic, yet somewhat morose and creepy. The underwhellming drums at the beginning add the perfect effect. After a few seconds the main riff kicks in, and this loud and heavy, yet midtempo, melodic rocker begins. This ode to the porn industry shows the band at it's most cynical--from the perspective of its rowdy audience. The radio staple \\"Sinners Swing\\" is a bit more upbeat, but only slightly so. The midtempo \\"Hear About it Later,\\" a song about unfaithfulness, is  bitter, yet confident. The rhythm section towards the end of the song--with Michael Anthony's pounding bass over Alex Van Halen's light percussion is magnificently stunning. \\"Unchained\\" is undeniably the albums' highlight and one of Van Halen's, and rocks' greatest songs. From the classic opening chords, the fast paced riff, to it's conclusion, this song is a masterpiece, and simply shows VH at their peak. The album comes back to earth with the funky, disco-like \\"Push Comes to Shove.\\" \\"So This is Love?\\" is one of Van Halen's best songs. It's incredibly catchy, with a great bass intro, and great riff and hook. If you listen to \\"So this is Love,\\" it is guaranteed to put a smile on your face, that's how magical it is. \\"Sunday Afternoon in the Park\\" is a foggy, somewhat offbeat instrumental. It adds a nice touch to the album overall. This instrumental leads into the short-but-sweet closing \\"One Foot Out the Door\\" which shows Diamond Dave at his meanest, with lyrics like \\"Now I'm gonna lose it 'cause that son-of-a-bitch\\"...A perfect conclusion to the perfect record.<br /><br />Before Van Halen wrote songs like \\"Why Can't this be Love,\\" before the lead-singer soap opera, there was a time when Van Halen was rightfully called the Mighty Van Halen, and \\"Fair Warning\\" proves it.  The best word to describe Van Halen at this stage in their career is, quite simply, cool. \\"Fair Warning\\" is simply one of the best, coolest rock albums you will ever hear in your life.<br /><br />The 2000 remaster sounds especially clear and sharp. You can make out subtle things that were easy to miss on the original CD pressing. Now \\"Fair Warning\\" can be enjoyed in all its greatness.nd one of Van Halen's, and rocks' greatest songs.

B0007TKNII|5.0|First let me say that if you have not read the book or seen the Broadway musical, then it is most definitely a movie you must see.      If you have read the book and/or seen the musical, then it depends on your point of view.  Books, Stage Performances, and Movies are all different expressions of art - and if you're point of view is to have a new and different experience with each version, then you should enjoy this movie.  If you are going to watch the movie and compare and look for discrepancies, then why bother.      It is a movie, and I would hope that my experience watching the movie would be completely different than when I read the book or watch the Broadway Musical.  And it is, a fantastically different experience.     The book, for me, is a fascinating read.  I experienced pity, awe, concern, fascination, curiosity, cynical humor, and more.  While reading you always picture the people and the situations and the picture is my mind is nothing like the musical or movie.  You get to know the man who is the phantom, Eric.  I pitied the phantom, but I was not afraid of him, nor did I fall in love with him.     With the musical my nerves were quite jumpy, scared, but curious at the same time. The voice of the phantom can send chills down your spine.  You strain to see into the darkest corners of the theatre, all around you, to brace yourself and prepare for HIM.  You fear him, but you yearn to see him.  Each and every time you see the stage performance.  He is truely more a Opera Ghost, The mystery captivates you and draws you to him.  So yes, I feared him and was drawn to him, but I did not love him, or pity him.      With the Movie, a new experience all together.  I envied the character Christine.  Not the actress Emmy with Gerard Butler, but the character Christine with the Phantom.  You can feel the attraction and the power of the phantom.  A dark passion draws you to the phantom - and you just may fall in love with him. Or wish you were HIM.  Fantasy, romance, love and lust, despair, anguish and heartbeark.      My views of Christine and Raoul were also different with each version.      I love all three versions of the Phantom of the Opera, and I do not think they take away from or diminish each other.  If they did, you wouldn't want to see the musical, watch the movie, or read the book again.  All three leave me wanting to re-see, re-watch, and re-read.     This is not to say that my experiences will be yours, but that if you are open to a new experience from a different version of the Phantom then you should pursue watching this movie.  If you want the book itself, as you see it in your mind, on screen...or the stage musical literally put on screen, with the hardly seen phantom, and that voice, and no changes; then that will not happen, so don't watch the movie.
B00005JNEI|2.0|I wish I was able to pen a review for this film without feeling it neccesary to reveal my political leanings, but that doesn't seem terribly prudent.  I'm a liberal, and I dislike Bush as a President.  I came into this film hoping to see incendiary information and novel insights; I came out dissapointed.<br /><br />The problem isn't that Moore is too biased, too angry, or a demagogue looking for public opinion.  I have seen all three viewpoints vigorously debated on this site, but that's not the issue.  The issue is that his film is disjointed and feels rushed.  The points Moore uses to tie Bush to the Bin Ladens are shoddily presented, and hints that Bush may have welcomed the 9/11 attack further cloud the issue.  Instead of picking a target and homing in, Moore seems content to attack Bush from every conceivable flank, leaving too wide a field and too little substance for things to sink in.  Further, too little of Moore's material is insightful or shocking.  The footage of Bush sitting in a classroom while the first significant attack on American soil since 1812 occured is compelling, but too much of the documentary is \\"been there/done that.\\"<br /><br />A documentary like this may reflect our country's freedoms and partisanship, but it doesn't reflect a well-constructed film or something worth spending money on- look elsewhere.  4/10
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie had me in tears!  It was one of the best movies of the year.  I love zombie movies and this one referenced them all.  Also, there was this lady sitting behind me, laughing her head off at all of the gory violence, which made it that much more fun.  What could be more entertaining than gore, heads getting smashed with whatever you call a cricket bat, and zombies?
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|This DVD has gotten some pretty silly reviews here on Amazon, mainly people posting \\"I like/don't like double-sided DVDs!\\" <br /> <br />Well, let me start off by agreeing and saying I don't like them either. The reason is due to the fact that by having a double-sided disc, smudges and scratches are not only guaranteed, but each company has their own method of double-sides which is really confusing. For example: Warner Bros.' old DVDs (the ones with the annoying cardboard snap cases) used to be flip-sides as well. They labeled them reverse, so that when the top of the disc read WIDESCREEN, you'd have to insert it _upside down_ for the widescreen version. I.e. you'd have to actually place the fullscreen side face-down for the widescreen. Which is actually quite logical as then the words \\"WIDESCREEN\\" are facing the consumer instead of vice versa. <br /> <br />MGM did it differently. They did it so that when you insert the widescreen side of the disc face-down, you're getting the widescreen version of the film. <br /> <br />This was really confusing to me (and some of my friends as well) because we could never figure out which side the DVD company had actually put the widescreen or special features on! To top it all off WB or MGM happened to change their style at one point and flipped the labels, so it was even harder to make out. <br /> <br />Also, flip-side DVDs are often labeled with small text and you get no graphics on the disc. <br /> <br />Yes, I am a huge advocate of \\"normal\\" DVDs and I like two-disc sets rather than flip-sides. <br /> <br />But I think complaining about it here isn't going to do any good. People have been complaining for years that CASINO didn't have a special edition, and now that it does, they're upset because it's flip-side and doesn't feature a Scorsese commentary. <br /> <br />Yes, I would have liked a Scorsese commentary as well. But here's the deal: I don't know if any of you have noticed, but his recent commentaries haven't really beencommentaries. On his Martin Scorsese box set, you could only select certain scenes to view commentary with. There was no commentary on the Taxi Driver SE DVD (although I heard there was one on laserdisc), and GoodFellas was awful stuff because it was cut into different groups. <br /> <br />Gangs of New York was similarly select-scene commentary and I felt as though they were taking snippets from interviews and playing them throughout the film. <br /> <br />So I wasn't hugely surprised to find out Scorsese hadn't done a commentary here. Top it off that a lot of people didn't like this when it came out and called it a re-do of \\"GoodFellas,\\" at least we've got new special features, new artwork and some documentaries. <br /> <br />Stop complaining, beggars can't be choosers!
B00005AQGH|5.0|This album was recorded right before Tupac's death. Some believe it was a message left for his enemies because he knew he was going to die. Others might say it was part of his plan to fake his death. Whatever the reason being, this is the deepest album ever recorded. Pay attention to the lyrics and words spoken throughout the entire album. There are many hidden messages played at a low volume so that you can barely hear. My advice is, have a recording studio take out the beat so that you can only hear the words or play it through head phones really loud. Suge Knight should have came out with an acapella version of this. Things to check out: Listen for the voice of some guy saying \\" suge shot 2pac\\" in the VERY beginning of the album. Listen to 2pac's emotional tone when he speaks his beliefs and the names of his people's at the end of \\"white man'z world\\" Listen to how they manipulate the voice of 2pac  as if his voice was some kind of spirit or ghost on the chorus of \\"me and my girlfriend\\", I've never heard this done before on any album. Listen to all the things 2pac says in \\"Hold Ya Head\\" and \\"Against all Odds\\" he has a lot to say and you will be amazed. Really listen to the album because if you don't you might never understand why some people say 2pac was more than a rapper, he was a leader. He WAS the Black Panther. R.I.P. Makaveli
B00005IC2H|5.0|This album is unbelievably beautiful. Amazing vocals with a cool reverb soaked guitar and the strings are also great. I encourage anyone to listen to this. They are also MINDBLOWING live.
B000002572|3.0|It sure sounds that way to me...LOL!   <br /> <br />Everybody always talks about the \\"crisp, clear sound quality\\" on this album and how Tom Scholz was a \\"genius\\".  If you ask me, I think the production is a bit TOO crisp and clear.  To me it sounds tinny and echoey.  But what would you expect from a self declared \\"genius\\", who put this album togeather over five years in his basement studio? <br /> <br />I've heard that this album was home-made for only $10 000, and I definately believe that.  The guitars blare and drone, and there is an irratating echoing noise throught the album.  It sounds like the band moved all their equipment into a big, empty barn and recorded the whole album in there! <br /> <br />No offence to all the Boston fanatics, but I just don't like Tom Scholz being hailed as a brilliant producer, when he is really just an amateur.  The myth of Tom Scholz being a genius is so widespread that I thought I'd better clear that up. <br /> <br />Bye!
B000929AJQ|5.0|I didn't like TDS very much. To me only a few songs were very good (namely Closer and Hurt) and the rest really didn't affect me in any way. I felt as though it was noisy and lacked harmony and power. For example the opening track on TDS starts off as gunshots and then turns into this loud trance-style heavy pounding percussion and you can barely hear Trent's vocals. That's the point, and that was the style throughout TDS, but it wasn't to my taste. <br /> <br />\\"With Teeth\\" sounded to me much more of a \\"band album\\" -- there are guitars here, there are drums, there are distinct vocals, and there is harmony. The lyrics are awesome and believe it or not, you can hear Trent in every one of these songs. <br /> <br />It starts off with All The Love In The World, a great song. Then comes You Know What You Are, which is heavier and better. One of the worst tracks is 03, The Collector, not a bad song but a bit too repetitive. Next comes The Hand That Feeds, one of the best songs on the album and a great single. Love Is Not Enough is a really good tiny epic as well and Every Day Is Exactly The Same might be the best song on here. With Teeth is pretty good (not sure it warranted an album named after it though) and Only is the second best song on here in my opinion. Getting Smaller is really good and so is Sunspots. The Line Begins To Blur: another great song and Beside You In Time is nice. Right Where It Belongs is a good way to close off the album. <br /> <br />Overall I felt this was the best NIN stuff I've heard yet. It's no surprise that a lot of the die-hard fans on here are giving it bad reviews and saying it's not any good - I think NIN has evolved from Trent Reznor to a band and although he's still the mastermind behind it, and writes some great vocals, the addition of more accessible guitars and rhythm and harmony makes NIN even better. <br /> <br />Let's see how many people agree with me:
B00006879E|5.0|Songs about Jane is a beautiful Cd full of even more lovelier songs  by Maroon five and their views on love and the world in general. Four have gone on to be top hits such as:<br /><br />Sunday morning<br /><br />This Love<br /><br />She will be loved<br /><br />Harder to breathe<br /><br />Maroon Five fans will not be disapointed in the rest of the songs on this Cd. Pretty much following the same beat and rythem as the rest of the songs. I for one never skip tracks, for some unknown reason they are all favorites of mine.<br /><br />The tone is Jazzy/rock/blues that the group managed to combine without tripping over each different catergory, each song being unique and beautiful lyrics in motion.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this Cd, and I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed. Enjoy.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I don't know how to describe the music on this album - and that is the gist of my review. While many elements of everything from blues to trip-hop to Zep riffs and everything in between keeps popping up, I kept telling myself that in this day where SO MUCH current music sounds the same, this is almost like something I've never really heard before (and so much different, AND better, than \\"Dreamland\\", in my opinion). Yet, the songs are always catchy in the composition department, while being loose and free-formish at the same time. Wow - what an album of contrasts! Additionally, Robert's voice, which I thought had begun to wear out years ago, is in top form, oftentimes almost playing the role of another instrument than simply a delivery vehicle for the lyrics. Great album, from an artist that can still put so many of today's \\"hot alternative buzz bands\\" to shame!
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|For all of the NIN fans who think that \\"change is good\\", listen to how it's really done.  After beginning to listen to \\"Lullibies to Paralyze\\", the first three tracks had me worried .  But it would get better.  Much better.  If I were to rate tracks 4-13 only, they would easily get 5 stars. Up until \\"Songs for the Deaf\\", I really did think that Josh Homme, whom I have been a fan of since his beginnings with Kyuss, could do no wrong.  I thought that half of \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" was killer, but there was half filler too.  But with his new album, Homme realy does show that he is on top of his game as a songwriter.  If you don't like this, you're just not getting it.  Your loss.  And as I fade away...
B0008KLVG4|1.0|Like all of you I dished out for the 25th Anniversary Edition of JAWS, and was disappointed in the features. The transfer was nice but the extra features weren't fantastic.  <br /> <br />This is the second time they've double-dipped, though, with no real great content. <br /> <br />JAWS: 25th Anniversary Dolby 5.1 <br />JAWS: 25th Anniversary DTS 5.1 <br />JAWS: 30th Anniversary \\"Special Edition\\" <br /> <br />-- <br />Available subtitles: English, Spanish, French  <br />Available Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 2.0), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)  <br />-- <br /> <br />So they've given us the DTS and Dolby this time. How nice. But I must ask - why not the first time? Why must we wait through three different editions for something we should have had the first time? <br /> <br />On top of that this new \\"30th Anniversary Edition\\" doesn't have a new transfer or new sound mix, they just put the stuff from the previous versions and stuffed them all on here. <br /> <br />The special features aren't too overwhelming either: <br /> <br />-- <br />The Making of Jaws For the first time ever on DVD, viewers will get a complete glimpse into the making of Jaws with this 2-hour documentary. <br />-- <br /> <br />Wow, a two-hour documentary versus the one-hour documentary that chronicled everything about the making of the film from pre-conception to post-production featuring interviews with the star and director that was available on the previous DVD... I can't wait to shell out $20 for a documentary that they should have included on the previous release, but didn't, and instead included a shorter but equally comprehensive one! (End of sarcasm.) <br /> <br />-- <br />From The Set An insider's look at life on the set of Jaws, featuring a never-before-available interview with Steven Spielberg. <br />-- <br /> <br />This is where you've gotta be careful. As a DVD consumer with over 460 titles on my shelves,I've seen this happen before: \\"a never-before-available interview with Steven Spielberg.\\" <br /> <br />Technically speaking, \\"interview\\" could be a three-second clip of Steven Spielberg saying \\"yes\\" to a question. It doesn't say new interVIEWS with Spielberg, it says interVIEW. And it's part of a documentary, which means -- you guessed it -- it's not anything to go hog wild over. <br /> <br />-- <br />Deleted Scenes <br />-- <br /> <br />These were on the previous DVD. <br /> <br />-- <br />Outtakes <br />-- <br /> <br />So were these. <br /> <br />-- <br />Jaws Archives Take a peak inside the Jaws archives including storyboards, production photos, and marketing materials, as well as a special segment on the Jaws phenomenon. <br />-- <br /> <br />Hmm, I smell a fish. Storyboards were on the last DVD, as were production photographs. Marketing materials means trailers and TV spots - that was on the previous DVD, too. <br /> <br />It's another case of the manufacturers re-wording previous content to make it appear fresh and new. By using words like \\"marketing materials,\\" you're being duped into thinking it's something that it's not. <br /> <br />Overall this DVD is a waste. It has less special features than the previous disc, which included another documentary, a trivia game, and one or two other small features. <br /> <br />On top of that, the artwork on this case is identical, only darker, and it has the words \\"30th\\" instead of \\"25th.\\" If they were truly trying to satisfy the consumers, they'd have released JAWS: The Definitive Special Edition 2-Disc Set, with new documentaries, new interviews recorded exclusively for the DVD, an inner essay/booklet (like Criterion does), new artwork, a new branching version of the film (that includes the deleted scenes instead of putting them under special features), and commentary by someone, maybe the cast or a film historian. (As Spielberg is greedy and refuses to do commentaries on his films.) <br /> <br />This is getting on mynerves because I like Spielberg but he's not helping to refute claims that he's greedy here. He releases about a gazillion special editions of each of his films, and never releases DTS and Dolby together on one disc. (E.g. Saving Private Ryan, Saving Private Ryan Collector's DTS Edition, and D-Day Commemorative Edition, which didn't even include the DTS track!) <br /> <br />It's clear as day that the companies are just after money, and Spielberg's popularity is letting them do this. <br /> <br />Be wise, investigate before buying this new DVD.

B00064WSN2|3.0|i would have to say that the previous two reviews, while right-on in most ways, don't really give the compositions on this record as much credit as they deserve.   <br /> <br />while certainly a weak link in the crimson chain, ITWOP includes the stellar tracks \\"cadence & cascade\\", \\"the devil's triangle\\", and the \\"peace\\" cycle; all which are indispensible to the crimson fan. <br /> <br />while i listen to this record less frequently than other crimson albums, ITWOP does come in above the \\"only for the completist\\" standard, by being a rather coherent album, with its own sparks of genius. <br /> <br />

B000005IU1|5.0|I first bought Funhouse...which blew me away, then I got this one, and I was slightly disappointed because I didnt get all the fire and brimstone that I got from Funhouse. However after listening to this album a few more times I started loving it. 1969 was always good, I WANNA BE YOUR DOG really captures the spirit of banging a hot chick in the back yard by the garbage bin...pure magic. WE WILL FALL is a bit long but it has something different- a chant, a mesmorising effect, a bit hard to explain. Then NO FUN , a real song about what is important....having a girl in your life to love, without going mooshy. ANN in my opinion is The Classic! A slow burning song about this slut called ANN .The guitars are just so strong in this song , Try listening to this tune more. The last 2 songs finish this album off nice. I cant believe these guys did so much with so little technology and money at this time. I wanna start a new band when I listen to this stuff. This album is # 185 on the Rolling Stone 500. If you want the best of Rock N Roll...then you gotta have The Stooges first 2 albums (this and Funhouse), Raw Power has horrible mixing on the Remaster, it's a damn shame what the numbskulls at Columbia did with that record. But this one is a definite winner, listen to it on a regular basis!
B00008S2VG|1.0|I haven't bought a madonna record since 1985. Listened to several tracks of this cd in a store, and then decided that I'll leave it that way.  <br />None of the songs I listened to were memorable. I even think Britney Spears' albums are way better and are much more creative.
0312995423|2.0|If you are thinking of picking up this book because you'd like a cerebral thriller, don't. It's fast paced (2 day read) but very shallow and not particularly well researched. <br /> <br />The fact that the Corgi edition paperback of \\"Digital Fortress\\" is covered with quotes praising \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and yet contains no glowing review snippets for \\"Digital Fortress\\" itself should be warning to the reader. This is a poor book. <br /> <br />Brown's NSA seems to be populated by petty egomaniacs with no respect for protocol and rules. We are introduced at the beginning of the novel to characters that are supposed to be mentally brilliant. Our heroine is supposed to have a 170 IQ and everyone around her is exceptional in one way or another. Yet none of them can think clearly, and all seem to be severely emotionally retarded. Suffice it to say that identifying with, or forming an attachment to, any of the characters is not possible. <br /> <br />The author gets the characters to use a lot of tech and crypto buzz words in order to lend them credibility.

Any reader with more than a passing knowledge of any of the subject matter (you know who you are!) will be frustrated by the inaccuracies contained in the book. <br /> <br />Truly interesting concepts are not explored in any depth.

079284131X|4.0|Director:  Tom Holland. <br />Cast:  Catherine Hicks, Chris Sarandon, Brad Dourif, Alex Vincent. <br />Rated R for violence, a foul-mouthed doll, and gore. <br />Running Time:  87 minutes. <br /> <br />\\"Child's Play\\" has spawned some ridiculous sequels (\\"Bride of Chucky\\", \\"Seed of Chucky\\"), but this original succeeds because it uses genuine suspense, solid performances from its cast, and slick, stylish direction from an underrated horror director.  A criminal who is on the verge of grisly death finds a nice-looking children's doll to plant his demonic soul.  The doll then engages on a murderous killing spree as it attempts to befriend little Alex Vincent.  Catherine Hicks (TV's \\"7th Heaven\\") is fine as the mother who will the evil doll at all costs in order to save her son and Chris Sarandon plays the detective in search of the real answers to all of these bizarre, gruesome murders. <br /> <br />Tom Holland, director and writer of films such as \\"Fright Night\\" and TV's \\"The Langoliers\\", directs this slasher flick with excellent precision and modus operandi.  What could have been another laughable, run-of-the-mill grossfest ends up being a taut, tense chiller that will make you laugh and scare you all at the same time.  Brad Dourif is creepy as the doll's alter ego Charles Lee Ray, using an incredible vocal presence to dominate the film and provide an identity that changed the horror genre forever.  A nice surprise of a film.  Check it out if you're a fan of the genre. <br />
B00005JKZV|5.0|`The Two Towers' is the second of the three movies capturing the novel, `Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien. This is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as `Ben-Hur' and `Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, `Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's `Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's `Gone With the Wind'. Another `Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole `Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of `Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.<br /><br />It is impossible to speak of any one of the three movies by themselves as they do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent films related by common characters, location, and history. `The Lord of the Rings' was a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than `Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as `Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.<br /><br />Unlike the movies of the first and third books, almost every major scene of the book `The Two Towers', is captured in the movie. The chapters of Merry and Pippin with Treebeard and the Ents are shortened a bit. Seems as if the Ents are much too slow for 21st century cinema. One thing the movie did get wrong in its promotional artwork is the suggestion that the two towers of the title were Orthanc and Baradur, the fortress of Sauron. Actually, the second tower of the title is Minas Morgul, the city of Gondor, originally named Minas Ithil, but renamed when the Nazgul captured it several years before the start of the events in `Lord of the Rings'. Minas Morgul plays a much bigger role in the middle of the story than does Sauron's stronghold. Part of this change of tower may be due to the fact that some of the action involving Minas Morgul was moved to the third movie, `The Return of the King'.<br /><br />The only piece of action I really miss is the role of Fangorn in the defeat of the besiegers of the Hornburg. And, in one of the very rare Peter Jackson additions to the story, I thought the skirmish between the Rohrrim / Aragorn and Saruman's warg riders was great cinema action, but just too much of a replay of Gandalf at the bridge in Moria, where a principle character is thought to have been killed and lost.<br /><br />I have read `The Lord of the Rings' at least 10 times, and the story of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli from the banks of the Anduin to the victory at the Hornburg is by far one of my favorite parts of the novel. Treebeard comes in a close second, as he is a part of the same ancient history of Middle Earth to which only the faintest hints are given in the stories of Fangorn, The Old Forest by the Shire, and Tom Bombadil. Basically, Bombadil and the Ents stand for what is most worth saving from the evil of Sauron. This innocence is something that is tainted even in the sheltered lives of the Hobbits.<br /><br />In contrast, after about the third or fourth reading, I often became anxious to get through the chapters about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as quickly as possible. One of the greatest of Jackson's accomplishments in the films was to breath life into the characterization of Frodo Baggins, who always seemed to be to be something of a wimp, drawn along by the inexorable hand of fate. Sam, on the other hand, was pursuing the quest entirely out of love and grit. Another great service of the movie was the realization of Gollum. I think that Gollum's implementation may be about as close as we will come for a long time in seeing a computer generated character be nominated for an Academy Award for acting.<br /><br />Even though `The Two Towers' is the middle third of a very long three part movie, it really has a much more satisfying ending than `The Fellowship of the Ring'. One starts to see how it may be possible to defeat the great evil challanging all the good guys in the story, but of course, the difficulty of Saruman's defeat is just a way of showing that defeating Sauron will be just that much more difficult.<br /><br />The second of the great three part classic!eatest of Jackson's accomplishments in the films was to breath life into the characterization of Frodo Baggins, who always seemed to be to be something of a wimp, drawn along by the inexorable hand of fate.

B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I was not a big fan of Led Zeppelin, but I've always liked Robert Plant's solo recordings (and the fantastic No Quarter). He never gets stale or rests on his laurels and his voice is still strong. All The Kings Horses is a lovely, almost acoustic song and beautifully sung. I like everything about this CD.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|To be able to review this film is almost as daunting a task as watching the film actually is. I honestly would love to hear a more elaborate argument for why this isn't one of the (if not, The) greatest movies ever made. The acting is incredible, the direction (by the amazingly talented Darren Aronofsky) is a brilliantly eccentric portrayal of an eccentric (and haunting) lifestyle. It's so hard to really find a flaw with this movie. It's a tragedy, pure and simple (and the best I've seen). It follows the book's fast paced, no holds barred style. It shows the nightmare of a drug filled life with such intense precision that I could barely move or speak after the end credits. Please, watch this movie, it's definitely not compatible with everyone, but it is a masterpiece in filmmaking.
1932907009|5.0|Having been around movies for a very long time, and as a working <br />professional in the field, I cannot tell you what a joy it was to read this <br />book. Most screenwriting books are so serious and so...stuffy. It was as if <br />someone had flung the windows open and a wave of fresh air had come into  <br />the room. Hands down the best of the screenwriting books I have read. And I have  <br />read them all. <br /> <br />If you are an artsy fartsy, indie wannabe filmmaker who thinks the sun rises and sets with movies like \\"Memento\\", and have no intention ever of writing salable script, skip this book. But if you really want to know the craft of screenwriting from one of the best spec screenwriters at work in Hollywood, buy this book. I dare any aspiring screenwriter to write a script that satisfies all of Snyder's ideas as framed in this book. You will have a sure-fire winner on your hands. <br /> <br />Snyder has done us all a great service by sharing some of his valuable techniques with us.
B00063MBU8|5.0|I love this CD! How canyou not like it? My mom even likes it. Anyway, each song is worth listening to and has a meaning to it. Only eleven songs, but they are all good! If you don't like this CD you must be (`_`) which means asleep. If you like this CD, then you are (*_*) amased, or extremly happy!
0767811070|5.0|It's been some time since I saw \\"Boyz 'N the Hood\\" but much of it has stayed with me.  I was impressed by so many of the elelments that went into making this such an excellent movie; the acting, the directing, the writing, the editing, virtually everything.  I'm just a fellow who grew up in Iowa and lives in North Dakota so I'm hardly one qualified to praise this film for its' realistic portrayal of inner city life.  I don't know if this movie is \\"realistic\\" or not in that regard.  However, I know that the writer and director had a message to convey and they conveyed it well.   <br /> <br />\\"Boyz 'N the Hood\\" is about many things.  It is about the challenge of raising a child in a one-parent home.  It is about the senselessness of random, pointless violence.  It is about the limited means of escaping the ghetto as a child growing up in it (and it does an excellent job of contrasting the dependability of education over sports).  It is about the importance of having pride and respect for your self.  There are so many messages on so many levels that it is hard to absorb them all in a single viewing.  That is what is so impressive about this movie.   <br /> <br />Although the movie shows us dead ends, violence, emptiness, failure, sorrow and despair, it leaves us with hope and an appreciation that that the straight and narrow road is still the best route to success no matter what the point of embarkation.
B0002SROT0|5.0|My friend played me some Elliott Smith in his car, while we were riding.  So...I became very curious about this artist, which I have never heard at the time.  So the next day, I went out and purchased Elliot's unfinished album 'From A Basement On The Hill,' and immediately became a huge fan.  Although, I have listened to Elliot's early works and did not like it that much, but I do love his later albums.  Anywase, BUY THIS ALBUM...it's just beautiful.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|This film is influenced by the video game Morrowind.  It's probably the only film one can say that about.  The \\"soldier demons\\" are what you get if you take a Hunger from Morrowind and slice off the top half of the head.    The film, to my mind, is a partially realized vision.  There should have been around 35 more minutes of Gabriel, Satan, and some backstory about the different magical artifacts.  There was an interesting supporting character whose name I can't recall ( the remote viewer ).    Nobody hung around for the scene after the credits.  I guess they all had better things to do, like crack.    Oh, one more thing: to all of you not-so-literate Amazon reviewers, it's \\"this film is the worst\\", not \\"this film is the WORSE\\".
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Well... If I want to listen Nevermore or Pantera I buy a Nevermore's or Pantera's CD, but when I want Dream Theater, I buy a Dream Theater's CD... Is a god albun, but it isn't Dream Theater... Comparate this Whit WDADU, Images And Words or Scenes From A Memory is like an Ant Fighting a Lion! KEVIN MOORE COME BACK!!!!!!!!!!! I love Dream Theater, but this album is for me the biggest disappointment in prog music. It's definetely their worst studio album. It's monotonous, repeating, with interjected John's solos which are technically perfect, but not captivating. I also miss Jordan's keyboards and Mike's typical drums. It seems to me that they lost invention, they repeat the parts from their previous albums (especially mid part of \\"This Dying Soul\\" is pure copy of \\"Glass Prison\\"), but this I wouldn't mind the most. The worst is that the whole album reminds me of Metallica, at first I didn't want to admit it, but it's a matter of fact. I hope that they won't go this way.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Her older stuff kinda worked b/c it was a variety of styles. This dont work becuase she aint black. Her father aint even fully black--he was half-venezualen. Its Like That Yall?! Since when did Mariah use the word YALL? We Belong Togerther is aiight, but the rest of this CD is pure crap.  Youd think Mariah would realize her career has ended after the laughable CHARMBRACELET, but she didnt. Dont even get me started on her wardrobe. Like her wardrobe this album is wack. Thumbs DOWN! its like that bad yall!
0743454529|4.0|I had many feelings about this book.  Firstly, I must say I do recommend it and think it is an excellent accomplishment for Jodi Picoult - she has tackled an issue rarely if ever found in a novel, and done an excellent job.  I have read the criticisms in some of the other reviews for this book, and can understand them, but when I look back over the book, I cannot agree with them.  The coincidences in the book, to me, reflect real life, which is full of inexplicable coincidences - but then, I believe that nothing is really a coincidence.  Why did I go to a David Bowie concert and, out of 80,000 people, end up sitting next to a dear childhood friend?  Anyway ... as for the ending, I can understand completely why readers would be bummed out over it.  But for me, a believer in the complex yet simple workings of karma, it made sense.  Anna's destiny, or life purpose if you like, was twofold - to stand up for her right to make her own decisions, and to save her sister's life.  With this ending both are achieved.  I could not call this book an enjoyable read - it gave me disturbing dreams and I cried at the end - but it is certainly a page-turner and extremely thought-provoking.  The characters are very well-defined and while the sideline plot can be a little annoying at times because all we really want to know about is Anna, by the end of the book I thought it all came together well and worked.  An excellent read particularly for parents, and anyone interested in ethics, medical or otherwise.  I have given it 4 stars only because I just read \\"Shantaram\\" by Gregory David Roberts, and nothing else can remotely compare!
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I really don't like this movie but I think the special effects were pretty good. It's just another Matrix film with some demons and Keanu Reeves saving the day in a world that you just have to understand to watch the entire movie. So I agree with some others reviews that only Rachel Weiz and the special effects are worth to pay for.
B000000OTU|2.0|Let's face the facts; the last REAL Aerosmith album was 78's Night in the Ruts, after that the band basically disolved, as Perry left for his solo career, and later Brad as well. All you had left was Tyler, who wasn't even focused on making good music anymore because of his addictions. They made a somewhat unsucseful comeback in 85 with DONE WITH MIRRORS, but that failed horribly. Aerosmith was and essentially is dead, i don't care how big they are now or how rich, the fact is they became a corprate rock act along the lines of Jorney and Kansas. Big Ones is a great CD full of CorpateSmith's best tunes, don't expect the real Aerosmith to appear on this ofcorse, you will get the record executive reconstucted hit machine know as CorprateSmith. -DUDE, LOOKS LIKE A LADY-,-RAGDOLL-,LOVE IN AN ELEVATOR-,CRYING-,JANIES GOT A GUN-, ect were all big hits in the late 80's and early 90's, CorpateSmith had stumbled upon that commercial cash cow and would grow to an even bigger entity afterwards. <br /> <br />This isn't a bad CD at all, if you are looking for some great pop, here it is, just don't expect any real Aerosmith here. Sad that they would become more of a empire then an actual band. People bitch about Metallica selling out,what they did was nothing! they should look at the actrocities Aerosmith has commited: Dodge Ram commercials, a concert with Britney,Nsync and other pop stars, thier own Aerosmith themed rollercoaster, the horredus song I DON'T WANT TO MISS A THING which is the single biggest insult to the greatness of their legendary 70's output,ect.At least Metallica had the balls to go commecial and sound good at it, while Aerosmith has become a charicture of it self. <br /> <br />Just get TOYS IN THE ATTIC or ROCKS or maybe even the underrated DRAW THE LINE instead of a CorpateSmith album, you will thank me.   <br /> <br />
B000067D4Y|3.0|As someone who knows a bit of history, the movie was spoiled a bit for me when the used a real character from history - HRH The Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, who had a real wife and real family.  I would have prefered them to use a fictitious British prince instead of a real one.  It would have saved me nitpicking this film.
B000003TAB|5.0|This album went by so fast in the 90's, that I barely remember it coming out. Luckily, a friend picked it up recently at a second-run store. This is in my mind the best Nirvana album I've ever heard. It's more punk than the poppy Nevermind, more avant-garde than the fairly New Wave In Utero, and it's funny. Kurt did have a sense of humor, it's just that sometimes he got packaged otherwise. The liner notes are great too, giving a little taste of some of the things Kurt was thinking before In Utero.  <br /> <br />When I was a kid, Nirvana was the big name, but Pearl Jam was my band. The heroin induced pop of Nevermind wasn't as appealing as the soulful Eddie Vedder. Now that first Pearl Jam CD sounds overwrought, and In Utero and this CD actually sound like music for adults. Give it a shot, but unless you like the stranger, more dissonant side of music, you probably won't like it. <br /> <br />Mexican Seafood is the pick of the bunch.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|This isn't another jaded review from a non-DM fan. I have followed this band since their first album, and I think their first three albums plus `Scenes From A Memory' are prog- metal classics. But `Train Of Thought' just doesn't come together. I still haven't found anything on this album that's done better than on previous albums, and there's certainly nothing new here. Even what seems to be their most maligned album (`Falling Into Infinity') is more interesting than this. Having said that, there's some incredible playing here. Their massive blowout jams still impress throughout \\"This Dying Soul\\", \\"In The Name Of God\\" and highlight \\"Stream Of Consciousness\\". But the songs lack an overall spark or progression that you expect from a band of this caliber. Too many times they rest on the same style they've been hanging on for well over a decade, and there's nothing progressive about that.  <br />Okay, maybe there is something new on 'Train Of Thought': James LaBrie tries his hand at a rap-style delivery (\\"This Dying Soul\\"). Unfortunately it's laughable at first and tiring in the long-term. And LaBrie's rip-off of Metallica's \\"Blackened\\" in the same song is way too close to call it anything but shameful. And while LaBrie is under the miscroscope, his style gets more annoying as D.T. albums progress. While I can't imagine any other vocalist on `Images And Words' and `Awake', at this point his aggressive tone sounds totally insincere (\\"Honor Thy Father\\" being but one of many examples), and the lack of high-end is disappointing as far as my own personal tastes run. His mid-range still soars, and as long as he's not trying in vain to sound like an angry young man, he still does his job. The inclusion of a ballad (\\"Endless Sacrifice\\") helps to give the album some depth, but the song is rather bland and remains unmemorable even after several listens in a row.  <br /> <br />I'll listen to this album rarely, but when I do it'll be for Jordan Rudess' sonic and creative range, aswell as the always-dependable Portnoy/Myung rhythm section. Beyond that, these songs don't stick. There's nothing fresh here, and there are several other Dream Theater albums I would much rather listen to when in the mood. `Train Of Thought' deserves some degree of credit, but it's hardly mandatory and I wouldn't even call it recommendable. <br />
0780622553|5.0|I saw this movie in the box office and it blew me away. The noir look and feel of the movie. The sinister strangers that pop up. The fact that the plot unfolds in front of you gradually in this film. Alex Proyas made a winner in this movie.  <br /> <br />This movie really plays with the whole concept of what you think is really actually isn't. It does so by allowing you to realize this as John Murdock, the main character, does. Pieces don't make sense at first and then fall into place later. In my opinion this is a superior form of telling that concept then how it was done on The Matrix, where the concept of reality not being reality is practically spoon fed to you (Don't get me wrong. I really like The Matrix. I just see this one aspect as limiting compared to Dark City). This is where Dark City shines.  <br /> <br />The acting is superb all around. The special effects are very impressive for its time, especially with the budget they had to work with. The script is unique and very well laid out.  All in all this is an excelling science fiction film that plays out like a mystery and holds onto you until the finish.  <br /> <br />The DVD might not have nearly as many bonus features as the ones you see these days, but when I got this DVD back when it was released it seemed feature-rich. The big bonus feature back then was the director's commentary and it's still the sign of a good special edition. Alex and the production team go into some real fine detail on the movie which makes the commentary that much more special. You also get a commentary from Roger Ebert that feels more like an analysis, but is actually a good analysis.  <br /> <br />Other features include actor profiles, a review comparison between Dark City and the silent movie Metropolis (Roger Ebert seems to find many parallels between the two), and a game called Return to Shell Beach (which I never really figured out or cared to as it meant disrupting the movie while playing it).  <br /> <br />Considering the price tag on this DVD now it would be a crime NOT to get it. The movie is excellent. Believe me. If you're a sci-fi fan you don't want to miss this one.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I agree with some of these \\"negative\\" reviews- but to give it one star is a bit harsh- It sucks, but not 1 star sucky.
0060521880|1.0|My English I class read this book last April, and no one really liked it, including me.  The book isn't that catchy, it's just plain creepy.  Coraline enters another dimenson through a door, which just beyond is the strangest world she's ever been in and I, a avid reader, had never read anything like.  Though some people may like the children in the closet's souls locked inside marbles, the \\"mother\\" wanting Coraline to sew on button eyes, and the hand of the mother that sounds like something off the Adam's family, I (nor the seventy other kids in English I) didn't find it intresting or funny, but strange and demented.
B0002X314C|1.0|February 2005, I find out the John Legend is coming to town.  \\"Who?\\" I ask my friend, she hadn't really heard of him either, but sometimes you've got to take a risk.  Well, I ask around, and no one in my circle has heard of this guy.  Finally I ask my sis in Cali, and she says yeah, \\"I went to see him a couple of months ago!\\"  He's much better live than the CD. ...  That should have been my first clue the CD was going to be pretty bad.  I decided to skip the show, \\"thank god\\" and purchase a used copy of the CD.  I'm so glad it was a used copy because this is the worst CD I have purchased this year.  Artists and publicists should really be careful about throwing around terms and comparisons relating to R&B golden age artists.  This kid is no where near that league.  He is a legend in his own mind as far as I'm concerned.   <br /> <br />Now I'm being honest, the first time I played the CD, I thought \\"Meeh\\".  I'm glad I didn't throw a lot of money away behind this guy.  The second time I listened to it, I thought \\"Meeh\\".....  The third time......etc.  It never got any better to me!  It's now 3 months later, and it gets no play.  You know, how sometimes a CD can endear itself to you after you play it over and over for a few weeks.  I have tried to play this CD since February, and my opinion has not changed one bit.   <br /> <br />In my opinion, there are only 2 tracks that are decent \\"Ordinary People\\" and \\"Get lifted\\".  The rest are just ho hum, or down right bad.  I guess had I known that Kanye West was his benefactor, I might not have gotten this CD.  I'm getting tired of CDs being pushed with a few good songs, and the rest filler, intros, and just bad tracks.   <br /> <br />If he gets another chance, he better take it to the next level.  Or he will be known as another one hit \\"R&B\\" wonder.  Hum, quite a legend. <br />
B000929AJQ|5.0|Hardcore Nin fans should really appreciate the musical development and direction Trent has went. I've been a fan since Broken first came out. Best way to describe this CD is, that Trent again can never go wrong. Its a combination of everything between Pretty Hate Machine and The Fragile, with New Order's early 90's poppy sound, a dash of Further Down the Spiral, with Dave Grohl doing some drumming, and with Still as an obvious prelude to With Teeth.  <br /> <br />I suggest listening through a nice pair of headphones a couple of times, and listen closely as alot is going on the background. Definite good buy for any appreciative Nine Inch Nails fan. Also would suggest this to anyone who enjoys the industrial sound. I suggest not to listen of the reviews from \\"Nin fans\\" that think Closer is all about sex.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|<br />  If you seen the musical, you should the film version too.   <br />  Andrew Llyod Webber and Joel Schumacher give this film <br />  so much detail than any other Phantom of the Opera that <br />  was made.  It may not won any awards, but this film is the   <br />  best of all musical movies that I have ever seen.
0679746048|4.0|It is never entirely clear whether author Susanna Kaysen was properly diagnosed. She went to the doctor to have a pimple examined and was persuaded to immediately check herself into one of New England's pretigious mental health hospitals...her doctor helpfully calling her a taxi. Her parents, shadowy figures throughout the book, seem to have offered no protest, and even happily paid the hospital bills. There's a lot to question here. Much later, she learns that her official diagnosis is borderline personality disorder...and treats us to the DSM-III definition of this disorder.<br /><br />What fascinated me about Kaynen's story is that it is very much the story of middle-class America at mid-century. The postwar mass compulsion to mime (or invent) normalcy was beginning to ring false. The forced buoyancy of the early 1960s was moving manically toward the disorder, madness, and assasinations that would make the year 1968 a turning point in American history (and therefore the history of the world). The culture at large was going through an identity crisis, experiencing its own large-scale borderline personality disorder: instability of self-image, uncertainty about life issues (sexual orientation, long-term goals, values), affective instability, impulsiveness, and even suicidal tendencies. Kaysen seems to be little more than an articulate symptom-bearer for this highly dysfunctional nation.<br /><br />These simple memoirs make for insightful supplementary reading for anyone who enjoys the great fiction chroniclers of American mid-century madness: Bellow, Mailer, Plath, Cheever, and Updike.<br /><br />The title of the book is borrowed from a Vermeer painting at New York's Frick Museum--Girl Interrupted at Her Music. Kaysen's is a thoughtful memoir and we can be happy that her music was only interrupted, never silenced.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Send out to Maria Devries. I had a lot of friends in High School and I think this movie is excellent. Napolean is just a supernerdy kid who says stuff that I have tried to add to my repetoire. Like Idiot in a real slow self hate manor. Napolean lives with his grandma and ver weird brother Kip who is like 30 and goes on internet sites all day. Kip wants to get into Karate and wants to start. Then later Napleon becomes friends with Pedro and Deb. Pedro and Deb are nerds to but Deb knows she is nerdy. The popular kids at the high school are kind of nerdy two. Everyone is really stupid but smart. Later on Napoleans uncle moves in after there grandma had a accident. He was a football god and wants a time machine to back to 82. Then his Uncle and Brother sell stuff and make very little money and even sell stuff for breast enhancements. Napolean gets crushed at the prom after the girl leaves. Then his brother falls in love with a Foxy sista from Detroit. And at the end they get married. It was a great movie. I watched it 3 times
B0007Y08T2|5.0|Much like the title implies, Dark Tranquillity's sophomore effort is much like a gallery: it is a collection of various forms of art. The entire album - songs, instrumental performances, vocal performances, and the overall vibe - follows atypical stylings. Scandinavian folk is one of the more obvious influences upon this album. Songs are built in movements as opposed to more typical structures, adding a sort of classical feel to the music. _The Gallery_ has all of these qualities, and still manages to incorporate enough aggression and energy to be considered a heavy metal album. <br /> <br />The lineup here is composed of five musicians who are all highly talented at what they do. Fredrick Johansson and Niklas Sundin play nearlly all of the guitars on this album, save for most of the acoustic/clean electric parts, which are played by bassist Martin Henriksson. This is interesting, because later in Dark Tranquillity's career, Henriksson would replace Johansson on guitars. While the guitars are, of course, very prominent (Dark Tranquillity are a kind of metal band, after all), the drums and bass refuse to be lost in the mix. Henriksson plays crafty, often complex melodies which rather frequently push through even the heaviest guitar riffs. And drummer Anders Jivarp is both thunderous and intricate, managing to finely complement the band's heavier moments without creating over-emphasized bouts of double-bass/snare flurries which many a metal drummer will often overdo. <br /> <br />There are also several moments of guest work on this album. One of these is from the producer, the ever-hard-working Fredrick Nordstrm, who adds keyboards and piano to several songs. Frasse Franzn plays the timpani on \\"Mine is the Grandeur...\\" And of course, special guest Eva-Marie Larsson performs all female vocals on this album. For their first four albums (_Skydancer_, _The Gallery_, _The Mind's I_, and _Projector_), the band has had four respective guest female vocalists, each with their own highly unique styles. Eva-Marie performs the most out of all of these, adding her powerful voice to \\"Lethe,\\" \\"...Of Melancholy Burning,\\" and of course, the title track (where she makes an poignantly emotional and poignant performance). <br /> <br />_The Gallery_ is the first album to feature Mikael Stanne on lead vocals (he used to be a guitarist, before their former lead singer, Anders Fridn, left the band to front fellow Gothenburg band In Flames), _The Gallery_ sports highly elaborate lyrics. Gothic and cosmic imagery dominate Mikael's words, with a sense of dismal despair and tragedy throughout. It is with Mikael Stanne's voice that his lyrics truly come alive, and it becomes evident that the lyrics/vocals to this band are a far cry from those of the typical metal band. Mikael has an impressive range in his pseudo-death metal voice, ranging from snarls of fury to howls of pure despair; he is definitely one of the most emotional vocalists in a band of this nature. There is also a brief moment of his clean voice, performed as the climax of opener \\"Punish My Heaven,\\" where he belts out the last two words of a nerve-shattering howl: \\"...it's the choice between heaven...AND HELL!\\" <br /> <br />The guitars are heavy, of course, but with a sort of dazzling, animated animosity which is atypical to many a metal band. For instance, after the intro melody to \\"The Dividing Line,\\" there are several jagged guitar riffs which create an unmistakable metal vibe. However, even this song succumbs to Dark Tranquillity's brilliance, especially in the bridge, where the guitars howl a beautiful harmony. This band has mastered the art of being heavy for art's sake, so to speak. <br /> <br />And not all of the guitars are heavy, either - just listen to the intro to the title track, with the acoustic strums and clean electric leads. \\"Mine is the Grandeur...,\\" prelude to album closer \\"...Of Melancholy Burning,\\" sports three acoustic guitar tracks, all perfectly harmonizing their melodies in a Latin-stylized theme, accompanied by the thundering of timpani beats. This latter track is built upon a series of melodic leads, with a sweeping, yet delicate, theme which evokes a brooding feeling of tragedy, especially with Eva-Marie Larsson's uplifting vocal delivery creating an epic-feeling climax. There is also a brief acoustic guitar finale, both complimenting the song as well as its prelude. <br /> <br />On \\"Edenspring,\\" the music starts as a relaxed bass melody (played over a scintillating cymbal rhythm) into a series of loud, fast-paced tremolo riffs, with a terrific, desperate howl from Mikael. During the bridge, the heaviness fades and a brief but effectively somber piano solo appears. Then a twin-guitar harmony spills in, weaving a delicate lead before the two instruments split back into the main melody. <br /> <br />\\"Lethe\\" starts with a five-string bass chord progression, played in a low-key fashion which carries a sort of dark, yet lyrical, vibe. Then heavy guitars roar in (harmonizing well with the bass melody, as opposed to completely obscuring it), and the song builds in structure from there. <br /> <br />To listen to the album is to behold Dark Tranquillity's true power. True as the title implies, this is Dark Tranquillity's _Gallery_ of darkly beautiful music at its best. _The Gallery_ is, without a doubt, a masterpiece.

B00008BXJ6|4.0|Whether you love them or hate them, one thing can be said for AC/DC:  There is no BSing in these guys.  AC/DC have been playing the music they want since day one and no amount of bad reviews or record sales is gonna change that.  Most rock bands from the 70s fell victim to the 80s.  Bands like Rush, Yes, Judas Priest, Blue Oyster Cult, Kiss all put out at least one 80s album that was seriously below the band's talent.  Same thing happened when we hit the 90s.  Did AC/DC put out a hair rock, synth pop or grunge album?  Nosiree, Bob!  Sure, alot of folks complain that AC/DC have pretty much put out the same album over and over again through the years, but when that AC/DC mood hits, nothing else will satisfy.  No one else sounds like them either.  Hell, almost anyone can identify an AC/DC song before they hear any vocals.  High Voltage was the one that finally made me say, \\"I like AC/DC\\"  Sure, I had Back In Black(who doesn't?) and The Razor's Edge, but it wasn't until I got High Voltage that I really got into the band.  Many casual fans will probably overlook this one in favor of the more famous Back In Black or an album with more radio hits, but don't you go making that mistake, bub!  High Voltage, unlike Back In Black, doesn't have any filler songs, though some would disagree with me on that.  Plus, how can you not love the cover.  And High Voltage has the mighty Bon Scott on vocals.  Scott is THE AC/DC singer, no offense to Brian.  As you can probably guess, High Voltage basically sounds the same as any other AC/DC album, but to my ears, none of the songs on this album drop below a 4 star rating.  High Voltage is Highly recommended.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I thought there was something there after I watched *Lost in Translation*.  It left me, of course, asking, \\"Isn't there a point to this movie?\\"  I didn't exactly go out getting this movie with expectations (I bought it together in a pairing with *Eternal Sunshine*).  I had no interest in watching this movie before I got it.  I didn't really know what to expect.  I knew that Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola had been nominated for awards for it.  The only thing of the content that I knew of this movie before watching it was what a friend of mine had described to me: a scene where Bill Murray's character was listening to a translator translate Japanese into English, and long Japanese sentences were communicated in only a few words in English, while a few Japanese words were translated into novel-sized speeches.  The sad thing was that my friend's description of the joke was funnier than the actual manifestation of it on film.<br /><br />Needless to say, I didn't receive this movie as well as my friend did.  But that's not to say I didn't get it, as many who claim to like this film will probably tell me.  Nor did I give it a superficial and impatient viewing, in case anyone wants to tell me that I should have looked more closely at the movie instead of wondering throughout why I didn't simply get a shot of morphine and save myself two hours of work.  I once thought I didn't get it after I had watched the film.  But then I asked around, asked other friends who had seen it.  I asked, \\"Did I miss something?  What was the point of the movie?\\"  And the answers came back pretty much what every positive reviewer on here has said: \\"The finding of good company even in a strange world,\\" \\"The solace one finds in another in loneliness,\\" \\"The charm and beauty in the subtleties of a non-sexual relationship,\\" etc.<br /><br />Well, they weren't telling me anything I hadn't known before.  And after a second viewing, they still hadn't told me anything I hadn't known before.  Essentially, I had already gotten it the first time, but I thought I didn't, because I was looking for more.  I was looking for a point that I thought was worth putting on the screen, instead of the ones I had confirmation for from so many others.  My confusion was in wondering, \\"That can't be all to it, right?  No one would have laid down millions to make so much noise without anything to say, right?\\"  And instead of getting something more from the answers I received, I got explanations that would usually be the start of a premise.  And this is what this movie is: about two hours of shaky character development, and when the conflict, aside from Charlotte's getting upset over Bob's cheating on his wife with the lousy lounge singer instead of with her, is about to begin, the movie ends.<br /><br />Actually, we can only assume that Bob didn't cheat on his wife with Charlotte, for the movie constantly hides transitional scenes from the viewer, and we can only assume certain things.  When Bob shows up to Charlotte's room for the first time, we must assume that she at some unknown point gave him her room number, for the camera never tells us.  And when Bob gives her a stuffed penguin at the hospital, we can only assume that Bob had bought it at a nearby gift shop or that someone else had given it to him.  We simply don't know.  One moment he's mocking an old Japanese man, and the next, the old man is gone, and Bob's holding a stuffed penguin.  Maybe the old man Bob was mocking transformed himself into the stuffed penguin.  We don't know.  The priorities of this film are haphazard.  Instead of showing Bob mocking the old Japanese man, Coppola could have used that time to show Bob procuring the penguin.  At least have him go to a gift shop and mock an old Japanese man there and fill in the missing transitional detail.  And while that detail may seem trivial, missing details such as what Charlotte and Bob might have done after the conversation they had in bed are not trivial, nor can theybe assumed.  Did she stay the night?  If not, how did they depart?  If Charlotte did stay the night, what did they say to each other in the morning?  These are the very details a director must show us in order to give nuances to characters and explain motives and foreshadow decisions and actions later on.  Yet, the viewers must fill in these parts of the screenplay for themselves.<br /><br />These missing details also leave the viewer wondering how the relationship between Charlotte and her husband will be (which would be much more interesting to explore).  It leaves the viewer wondering how Bob will reconcile his situation with his wife at home, which would also be much more interesting to watch.  But those questions don't seem to ever play into the movie--never in the psychology of the characters, even.  Throughout the movie, as the relationship between Charlotte and Bob develops, the two characters never once question what they're doing as it would pertain to their spouses.  The closest we get is Charlotte's briefly looking at some pictures of her husband, probably to wonder why she had married him.  For whatever reason, dewy-eyed romantics will gloss over all the structural and logical problems of this film to accept its context as not only justification but the starting point to root for the main characters to be unfaithful to their spouses, whether physically or emotionally.  So, instead of hoping that they can work out their problems with their respective spouses, we are supposed to be glad to see them fall for each other.  (And no, this relationship isn't purely platonic.  The ending refutes any claims that Bob and Charlotte intended this relationship to be purely platonic.)  This implicit goal to have the viewers root for the protagonists' infidelity is questionable at best.<br /><br />The subtlety of the relationship between the two characters may be charming to watch (thanks mainly to Bill Murray's presence and the tension provided by our curiosity to see if they will do anything more than talk to each other), but the characters are never realistically fleshed out.  I'm sure that philosophy graduates from Yale do not listen to self-help tapes, nor do they regress into asking why the Japanese in the setting of Japan of all places would have trouble speaking English.  The question about *r*s and *l*s is especially puerile.  And I'm also sure that philosophy graduates from Yale would know enough to be able to take a step back from their problems, such as their sense of loneliness and alienation, to try to see the problems objectively and find a solution to those problems.  They don't merely seek shallow and short-term solutions, such as begging to be lavished with attention.  There may be many moments of slow-paced dialogue, but just because slow-paced dialogue is in direct contrast to flashy cutting and exploding cars does not automatically make characters and themes complex.  Nor should it automatically evoke the assumption that something is beautiful simply because it tests our patience.  I know the so-called art house audiences will find these facts hard to believe, since they believe that they are the only ones who truly get it and that the rest of the world doesn't--because it is imperative that anyone who does not get such things must like only slap-stick, nudity, and gratuitous violence.<br /><br />The point, however, isn't whether the rest of us get it or not.  I got it.  I don't very much care for slap-stick, nudity, or gratuitous violence.  And I'm going to venture to guess that most of the people who saw the movie got it.  The answers given by my friends who liked the movie echoed my own guesses as to the point of this movie.  The reviews that many of those lathering praises upon praises on this movie echoed my guesses.  I understood that this movie was about desperately trying to find that connection in the context of alienation and all those other things.  It actually doesn't take great smarts to figurethat out.  The question is: do I care?<br /><br />Another reviewer here found this movie to be as pointless as *American Beauty*.  I am not sure how one can compare these two movies.  *American Beauty* actually tied everything together in the end.  The soliloquy in the end echoed a few things in the middle of the movie, giving those moments greater significance.  Yes, random things seemed to happen, but in the end, everything came together, and we go away with a poignant revelation of the beauty of all occurences, good or bad.  And all characters, be they looking to be liked, looking for power, looking to regain dignity, looking for love, they are all looked upon as beauty in the greater scheme of things.  In the end, I cared about the characters, the themes, the movie.<br /><br />In *Lost in Translation*, we have none of that.  The two protagonists are self-absorbed, a bit spacey, and are just a little obnoxious in their sense of superiority over a different culture.  And yes, some of the stereotyping are offensive, but I don't really expect people to actually sense this unless they're Asian.  After all, the American identity is represented by the two superior characters in the film (who happen to be white).  They are the ones we are supposed to identify with.  So it's probably difficult for non-Asians to actually step out of that identity, once they're in it, to understand how offensive some of the portrayals of the Japanese were.  There are many people who say that Asians shouldn't be offended by the portrayals and thusly, and summarily, dismiss the complaint.  But I don't know what right those people have to dictate whether someone else should feel offended.  The person who is offended is the one with the right to claim offense.  It is irrelevant to the people feeling offended whether YOU are offended or not.  Ironically, those who claim that we don't \\"get it\\" in regards to the point of this movie don't seem to \\"get it\\" in regards to the racism in the movie.  (Perhaps they don't want to get it, lest it diminishes their chance to boast their appreciation for this movie.)  But just because YOU don't understand the context (in this case, being Asian) and therefore feel no offense doesn't mean that there is no valid offense to those who do understand that context.<br /><br />And the claim that demeaning the Japanese is supposed to make the Americans seem awkward and crude (because we see the world from the Americans' point of view), therefore emphasizing Bob's and Charlotte's alienation, only contradicts the intention of the film.  If the audience is supposed to like these characters and care for them, we should hope that they are not awkward and crude; and that if they are, they would redeem themselves somehow for being bad guests in a foreign country.  But they never do redeem themselves for their supposed awkwardness or crudeness.  They never even attempt to learn anything about their surroundings.  The only redeeming quality in their racism (as is with all racism) is that sense of superiority that they instill in others who can identify with them.  It is the ONLY reason anyone can accept the racism of others.  The context of alienation could have been formed in a number of other ways, whether through peer group status, financial status, or social status.  But to pick ethnicity and exotic culture, especially with the foreign country as the milieu, as the focus of conflict of status is inevitably misguided and tasteless.  It doesn't matter if Coppola didn't intend her device to be a belittling, offensive one.  In the end, it is.  And to excuse it by saying it was incidental or it was an accident is just another way of saying that she was ignorant of what she was doing, for she didn't understand the culture with which she used to form the backdrop to the film.  And last I heard, calling someone ignorant for being racist is not a pardon but a condemnation.<br /><br />But that's beside the point.  It is beside the point that this movie might be autobiographical.  It is beside the point that Sofia Coppola's father is legendary and influential director Francis Ford Coppola.  It is beside the point that this heavily improvised movie based upon a disjointed screenplay inexplicably won an Academy Award for best screenplay even though much of the crucial details of the movie and the whispered ending itself must be assumed by the viewers.  The point is that *Lost in Translation* lacks any meaning worth spending a couple of hours to watch.  And just because you say that you can appreciate that lack of a greater meaning and that you can take two hours out of life to witness and cry over the beauty in that lack of a greater meaning doesn't necessarily mean that you have a gifted and greater understanding of art or beauty, as many reviewers in the other camp would vehemently declare.  Again, the question isn't whether one gets the point of this movie.  The point is easily comprehensible.  It's sort of like asking, \\"Why did the chicken cross the road?\\" and the reply comes back, \\"To get to the other side.\\"  Well, we already knew that.  It's not profound or anything.  And that kind of humor might have worked the first time we heard it.  But since we've grown past such vapid and childish jokes long ago, the question again is: do I care?<br /><br />The answer is no.r reviewer here found this movie to be as pointless as *American Beauty*.

B0006IIKS0|1.0|First of all, I fail to understand why so many people consider this to be such an excellent documentary. The only thing other than the few laughs at the expense of the band members that I got out of this film was a real irritation and dislike toward members of Metallica and associates. After listening to their music for at least ten years of my life, it was a bit disappointing to see how overpretentious and arrogant Lars Ulrich, James Hetfield, and Jason Newstead are. The entire documentary consists of Lars Ulrich sulking around with his bottom lip stuck out, whining about his life while constantly giving lip service to his overexalted ego. Granted, all of this is interspersed with an occasional failed attempt at modesty, but if you found Lars mildly irritating before you will go away hating him for the spoiled little brat that he is. Besides, I cannot take anyone seriously who is whimpering about his life while living in mansions, consorting with beautiful women, befriending rock stars, and selling multi-million dollar paintings. <br />James Hetfield, although not as annoying as Lars, and someone whom I can't help but have a grudging respect, exposes himself in much hilarity as he drives at great speed down an interstate highway in this bizarre looking hot rod waving at the people in the vehicles he passes by while claiming that he doesn't consider himself someone who likes to attract attention and doesn't see himself as a \\"famous person.\\" <br />Out of all of them, the one who made me laugh the hardest was Kirk Hammett. I didn't realize how girlish he is with his soft voice and red rimmed watery eyes. Even one harsh word between Lars and Hetfield was almost enough to send tears streaming down Kirk's swarthy cheeks. <br />Another thing that was worth watching was Dave Mustaine from Megadeth crying about his being thrown out of Metallica decades ago for being a drug addicted lush and how it completely destroyed his life forevermore. The only thing that would have made that scene more laughable would have been if the petulant Lars and self proclaimed loser Mustaine would have exchanged some blows. <br />The only thing this film clarified for me is why Metallica's last album was so poorly done. Why the quality was so awful and why the lyrics were so far below even being mediocre. <br />The old Metallica has passed us by and is gone forever without a scream, crash, or even a bang, but a softly spoken whimper. Leaving us with a Metallica that has become nothing more than a group of middle aged spoiled brats with grossly overblown egos that are even bigger than their bank accounts. <br />Sad, but true.
B00004R99U|5.0|Why I think so? Because I think the original one was too sorrowful, it's beautiful though. Pocahontas' story in London was magical and wonderful, and acted perfect when she faced the king and the queen of England. But the end of this story was too strang-Pocahontas was in love with another man, not John Smith???
038572179X|4.0|This was a great story about love, sadness and drama. The view from different individuals was very interesting. The tale of various events (love and deception) during the war. The love affair of different wealth class individuals, within a close environment. The descrition of events and environments are great and keeps you turning the pages for the next events in the book. If you like story telling then this is a great book to read.
B00005KARK|5.0|\\"Dumbo\\" was the first Disney's film I view. It was sorrow and beautiful. The story of Dumbo told the children that mother's love is pure and deep, and it will last forever. The story told us that we should learn how to love people around us. And it told mothers that children need mother's love no matter they are young or grew up. I think the story told me that if I try my best, don't afraid of anything, I will succeed!
038572179X|5.0|My wife had read this novel and recommended that I do so as well.  \\"Atonement\\" starts off measured and slow, much like an Austen novel, but the reader's reward is in McEwan's characters who are superbly and fully realized and in the elegant and mannerly depictions of their setting.  The reader is immediately engaged, and the fact that half of the novel is devoted to one day in the lives of these characters is all the more remarkable because the writing is so effortless and profound and is never tedious or plodding.  \\"Atonement\\" is simply fiction at its best; it rarely gets any better than this.  Some reviewers have complained that the ending is abrupt and disappointing.  I disagree.  The ending is remarkable for its revelation that redemption and atonement sometimes take years to grace our lives, and then again, sometimes elude us even at death.  \\"Atonement\\" is a masterpiece of fiction, and it is one of the most satisfying novels that I have read in the last several years.
0743454537|1.0|I threw this book down at the end and couldn't believe it was published.  There are so many unbelieveable coincidences in the plot that it was like watching a bad movie or sitcom.  Kate and Anna's mother just happens to be a lawyer and comes out of retirement just for this case to represent herself!  Anna's lawyer just happened to have a prior romantic relationship with Anna's court-assigned guardian!  Not to mention the terrible ending.  In addition, there are obvious questions that aren't asked or answered until the end -- only because it would ruin the big finale of the book.  But in reality, someone WOULD ask them.  If you don't mind ridiculous plot structure, then you may like this book.
B000929AJQ|3.0|not too bad, but, sadly, not too good either.  this album has some pretty interesting music, but the lyrics are boring and i really dislike the 'song-oriented' approach.  after listening to this, all i could think was \\"that's all?  i waited 6 years for this??\\"
0316172324|5.0|Mr. Gladwell does a wonderful job of piquing the interest of the reader.  I thought this was a very easy book to read and also very interesting.  Some of the information I knew, but Gladwell has a way of clearly examining things that we may \\"know\\" but not know how to explain.  I also have spent quite a bit of time at the Implicit Association Test, looking at the unconscious biases that I may have.  I found that to be one of the most interesting things in the book.  It makes perfect sense, but I had not heard it so succinctly posed and I have had to look at my own unconscious responses to others.  I would highly recommend this book if you wish to challenge your sense of self and look a little deeper into how you personally operate.  Great book, great read.
B0002858YS|1.0|I got suckered into buying this steaming heap based on that 'Somebody Told Me' song. Too bad nobody warned me that that is the only decent song on the album. The rest of the album is composed of pathetic crooning on the part of the lead singer and blantant U2 copycatting on the part of the musicians. Worst of all are the inane lyrics. For example from the effluviant pile of dreck known as 'Believe Me Natalie', we find the scintilanting lyrics:    'There is an old clich  Under your Monet, baby'    I rest my case. This one hit wonder will be forgotten in a year and that's good.
1932100385|4.0|I just finished the china study, and cannot give it five stars simply because it was very boring and difficult to finish.  However, the information in it is of extreme importance and the research behind it is formidable.  Campbell has worked much of his career as an objective doctor/scientist, and did not start out with a theory he hoped to prove, but did experiments to test variables, and from the outcomes he became convinced that a whole-grain plant based diet is the underlying cure for most diseases of affluence.  He has a holistic approach which he explains thoroughly, in which the body is too complex to study with cartesian reductionism.  I think that most people could benefit just by reading areas of interest in this book, but would not recommend plowing through start to finish--it just is not written in an engaging style to hold your interest.
B00004YRQA|2.0|Using the technology from this 8MB Memory Card (left over from the dead Terminator), you should be able to construct another Terminator robot and send it through time.   <br /> <br />If you create a bad Terminator robot, you should definitely soup it up like the A-Team van, with some crazy special powers that will help it destroy mankind.  If you create a good Terminator robot, just make it like normal (and P.S. thanks for saving mankind).
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This version is far better than the Spectorized version we've had to live with for over 30 years.  The songs Let it Be and Long and Winding Road are both timeless classics yet Spector's production makes them unlistenable after hearing these stripped down and superior versions.  No wonder McCartney pushed for this release.  What Spector (with Lennon's approval) did to these recordings borders on musical sabotage.  It's also unfortunate that John's contributions were, for the most part, sub-par.  Paul did his best to make this another classic Beatles album but John's abilities had already started to deteriorate
B0001I55OC|4.0|I saw this movie not having read the book, so I did not have any preconcieved ideas of what the story should be about.  Before I knew it I was pulled into the storyline and the love story that unfolded between two of the main characters. This is a great movie as long as you sit back,relax,watch it and don't over-analyze it.  If you do over-analyze it then yes you'll find flaws, but its a fun to watch feel good movie that's great for the whole family to enjoy.  <br /> <br />The dvd has also has a lot of extra features on how they made the movie, it was very interesting to watch.  I would definately buy this again!
B00005JNDZ|2.0|The first Bridget Jones movie was a perfect little human comedy.  Although absurdly unlucky, Bridget remained a consistent and logical (in her own way) centre to the film.  The humour grew organically from her \\"logical\\" reactions to the absurdity happening around her.  And we had a nice, romantic happy ending.  The same praise cannot be given to this sequel, \\"Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason.\\"  Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed the film in a superficial way, at least while I was watching it.  Unfortunately, it's entirely unecessary, except as a money-making grab by the studio. <br /> <br />The plot: Mark Darcy is seen in the presence of another woman.  Bridget assumes he is cheating on her and is then assigned a job in Thailand with Daniel Cleaver (the \\"ex\\").  Therein lies the main problem I had with the film: the entire story is built on misunderstandings that could be cleared up with the tiniest application of logic on any one of the characters' parts.  Similarly, actions are not driven by the nature of the characters, but rather the requirements of the plot.  For example, almost immediately after starting the relationship with Mark Darcy, Bridget's friends are advising her to dump him.  Why?  I have no idea - I guess because the screenplay told them to!  Similarly, if Bridget is thrown in a Thai jail while on assignment for her TV network, wouldn't someone at that network notice that she had gone missing? <br /> <br />Am I applying logic where none is required?  Probably.  But a sequel should be able to build on the characters rather than making them more two-dimensional (or making their actions arbitrary).  I should be asking is the film funny?  Are the actors good?  The answer to both questions is undeniably \\"yes!\\"  I applaud the idea of building a comedy around the question, \\"what happens after happily ever after?\\" Unfortunately, the film bails and gives us a series of silly little scenes that work on their own, but never add up to anything worthwhile. <br /> <br />On the plus side, Mirimax has deigned to give us at least a few extras on the DVD.  There are some deleted scenes, the most welcome being the infamous \\"Bridget interviews Colin Firth\\" scene from the novel.  Obviously, it became impossible to put this in the movie with Firth playing Mark Darcy, but they filmed it anyway at the end of a day's shooting and stuck it on the DVD as a treat to those who have read the book.  There are also some scene breakdowns and a director's commentary.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|What the hell are these guys thinking? Why do they thinking people can handle 12 minute average songs that intense? The solo's are just shredding and technical show off. I'm disappointed because DT starts to sound like a loony tune soundtrack instaid of honest thoughtfull songwriting. Training of Wrists is a better name!  <br />Im waiting for the New Symphony X- porcupine tree- and i would rather listen to Dreamscape- this is horrid!!!!
B0007Y08QA|4.0|First, allow me to say that Christian Bale's performance in this movie was truly impressive. Bale is brilliant in his role as Trevor Reznik, an insomniac tormented by guilt and anxiety. Reznik has not slept nor eaten for days and everyone at his work detests him for no apparent reason. Bizarre things are frequently happening to Reznik and his behavior becomes increasingly erratic. Unable to explain why these strange things keep happening to him, Reznik grows increasingly desperate. Is everyone conspiring against him or is everything that is happening to him simply a fragment of his imagnination? Why has he lost his apettite and why has not he slept for days? <br /> <br />All interesting questions but I am not giving away any answers. What I will tell you, however, is that this movie provides a momentous insight into such powerful emotions as anxiety, shame and guilt. This is a powerful story of a man who has found his own unique way to handle his guilt and anxiety. Another highly interesting yet controversial topic raised in this movie is that of the faulty memories. Will we ever be able to reach a consensus as to which memories are real and which are created? I doubt it. I believe that people have a propensity to \\"create\\" memories when reality becomes too difficult to cope with.   <br /> <br />Although skeptical at first, I was stunned by Bale's unprecedented performance for which he should have been awarded an Oscar. A final comment: in my opinion, The Machinist is one of the best psychological thrillers available. See it!
B0001IN0DA|1.0|I don't know why anyone would buy this. It's pitiful. The DVD is put together very well. The actual event, however, is very painful to watch, and not in the good way that is expected. WWE gives us this crappy show of non-exciting matches and this is their best? Stay away and watch TNA. Even if you like WWE(wimpy wrestlers everywhere) don't buy this. It is just a poor letdown. And on a personal note...I liked WWE until I watched this!
B000002TQV|5.0|I am a big Radiohead fan. Radiohead's music is divided into two different, expiramental genre's. Pre Kid A and Kid A and the newer releases. I like all of Radiohead's stuff, but pre Kid A Radiohead is my favorite.    \\"The Bends\\" is just an excellent album beginning to end! It is, in my opinion, the best album Radiohead has released yet to date. When my friends are interested in checking out Radiohead, I tell them to start out with \\"The Bends\\" and slowly work their way up to the newer CD's. I really feel \\"The Bends\\" is just pure genius. I know most would disagree and say \\"Ok Computer\\" is their best album. I like \\"Ok Computer\\" a lot, but \\"The Bends\\" blows it out of the water.    The first six songs are really good. The whole album is awesome, but my favorite songs are \\"The Bends\\", \\"High and Dry\\", \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and \\"Bones.\\"  This album is one worth owning, especially if you are new to Radiohead.The whole album blends so great. Each song compliments that last one perfectly. This is a great album to start out with before exploring their other works, which are all genius in their own way. I give \\"The Bends\\" five full stars.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|The 4 central characters are well played esp. Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, but this film just goes way over the top, opting for cheap fireworks instead of more examined fullness.  Way too many melodramatic reversals, too many histrionic fits and staged confrontations between the characters, until finally it just becomes repetitive and dull.<br /><br />The language is raw yes, but if you mind hey that's how most people talk under stress so grow up and get used to it.<br /><br />Julia Roberts does have probably the most \\"real\\" role of her career as opposed to her usual Barbie doll roles (excepting \\"Erin Brockovich\\"), but Jude Law and Natalie Portman are doing their usual familiar bits here, nothing remarkable.  Clive Owen egregiously overacts in the Al Pacino style but he's still fun to watch, like Pacino.<br /><br />Oh well, this still beats the pulp on TV at least.
0440234743|2.0|The book, The Testament by John Grisham is not a good book in my opinion. The book is a little hard to follow because of the point of view. It jumps around on characters, it goes from first to third omniscient.  <br />The characters were not explained well enough in my opinion.The only character that felt explained enough to me was the main character who killed himself. <br />The conflict was not hard enough to solve in my opinion. All the man had to do was fly to Brazil to find this daughter he had that no one knew he had. All in all its just not a very good book to read.
B00000JCB2|1.0|Usually, I don't write reviews on things I dispise, but I will out of pure anger. I put this record on and threw the headphones off my head, grabbed the disc, and broke it in half. This has to be the collection of no talent, no heart, and no work put into this album.  <br /> <br />I hate this cd and wish that it never existed. I HATE THIS CD!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Incredible writing, check.<br /><br />Beautifully nuanced acting? Check.<br /><br />Masterful directing? Check.<br /><br />A soundtrack that manages to be haunting, thrilling, and playful, often in the same song? Check.<br /><br />Episodes that match any other show on television, past or present, for quality and entertainment? Check.<br /><br />I've learned I can't watch an episode of \\"Firefly.\\" I can't even walk past the TY while it's on, not unless I want to dump my schedule for the next couple of nights to watch them all over again. And every time I find something new to enjoy. It's that good.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What an terrific series.  It was like watching Stargate.  You get to know the characters and really like them and their humor. <br />Every age group watched this series and loved it.  ASK MORE <br />PEOPLE TO WATCH IT AND BRING IT BACK BY POPULAR DEMAND.  I cannot believe this series didn't make it but I also do not remember ever seeing it advertised.   This is a great suprise gift for anyone who loves Sci-Fi and thinks they have seen them all.  FIREFLY SHOULD RETURN!!
B00003CXAE|5.0|Almost 30 years alter its premiere; Randal Kleiser's Grease is as popular as ever. To what do it owes its everlasting attraction? Maybe it's because this nostalgic musical vision of the fifties is one of those films where everything fits right into place.<br /><br />Without a doubt, another determinant factor that helped become this movie a classic is the great chemistry between its stars, beautiful Olivia Newton-John and the lovable and charismatic John Travolta.<br /><br />Grease is the store of Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsen, two teenagers that share a summer fling and upon the end of their vacation, go separate ways. Fate brings them together when sandy is transferred to the same high school Danny goes to. He's the typical adolescent, good looking, cocky and with a bad boy image. She's sweet, innocent and naïve, but not boring. She wears pink and is the antithesis of the girls on Danny's school.<br /><br />These two are as different as day and night, and along their friends will live turbulent and funny moments, typical of adolescence, until get that happy ending we expect in romantic movies.<br /><br />A musical lives or dies because of its soundtrack, and it's here where Grease shines thoroughly. The catchy songs, the always optimistic lyrics and the choreography spread rhythm with more power than a virus. The film, thank God, has been digitally restored and remastered. In Grease there is not one boring moment. It's a continuous celebration to the 50's pop culture, to adolescence, with the gracious touch of a director who knew how to conjure pure energy on the screen. There isn't necessary an excuse to watch it again and see why Grease is still the word.
0743487478|5.0|Our family has, by and large, adopted most aspects of attachment parenting and, as our daughter grew, positive parenting.  As I read this book, it felt as if Alfie Kohn had been inhabiting the recesses of my mind that were (to me) inexplicably torn about giving our daughter a treat when she used the potty.  Whether you read Alfie Kohn, Magda Gerber, William Sears, or many others, respect for children remains key.<br /><br />As a Children's Librarian, I see many flavors of parenting every day.  I also see the effects of parenting styles on unattended children on a daily basis.  What helps me remain a caring professional even on rough days is respecting the young customers who need assistance.  I've seen enough child reactions to silently hope for better from my own daughter, but this book has encouraged me to think about what I really want for her, why I want it, and how to allow her to become the best person she can be.
0156027321|4.0|When I read the jacket of this book I thought it was going to be an easy fun read. I expected a whimsical fantasy in the real world, but it instead turned out to be a darker allegory about a boy and his relationship to god and himself. <br /> <br />There are some great descriptive lines in which the author pulls together a string of words, which you have never heard before but make perfect sense.  I think his writing and use of the language to bring about feelings and both emotional and physical empathy in the reader is amazing. <br /> <br />This is similar to The Old Man and the Sea, though not quiet as poetic.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Anyone who thinks Seinfelf isnt funny is crazy. Its the funniest show of all time. Who knew a almost unknown comedian along with some actors who never made it big get together do a show about nothing and as a result have the greatest comedy of all time. The dvd has quite a few of my favorite episodes: <br /> <br />Male Unbonding <br />Chinese Restaraunt <br />The Pez <br /> <br />The show is a cult classic, fully of memorable qoutes, jokes.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|To make this as quick and as painless as possible, the movie was a huge letdown. Keanu Reeves look like he was just going though the motions here and delivers a rather stale performance that is the worse one in the entire film and that's a great feet considering that Shia LaBeouf, gives a painfully unfunny performance as his pet sidekick. Rachel Weisz is great but she's stuck with Keanu way too much and she would have been much lead than he was because she at least made you care about what was happening with the film while Keanu was just playing his Neo character again. Djmon Hounsou is fine but wasted in a bit part and Peter Stormare is criminally underused in a cameo.  <br /> <br /> <br />The special effects are great but there is really no story to be told and the script is pretty bad in some parts. <br /> <br />Avoid. <br />
B00006AG5N|5.0|Ok so I wasn't alive when Elvis was around but my mom was and she passed her love to Elvis down to me with many of the other oldies. I truly love Elvis and this CD rocks!!!!! I love it.

I HOPE SHE HAS ANOTHER CD OUT PRETTY SOON. CANT WAIT!!!!! <br />FAVORITE SONGS ARE : DONT TELL ME, FORGOTTEN, HE WASNT, SLIPPED AWAY, HAPPY ENDING, HOW DOES IT FEEL,NOBODY'S HOME.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I have been a Gilmore Girls addict since the first time I watched an episode in the first season.  I've been buying them on DVD as they've come out.  Third season has just as much wit and great conversation (at very high speeds) as the first two, and just as many obscure references (fortunately, it comes with a handy guide to \\"Gilmore-isms\\"). The quality of the show has not diminshed, but has grown stronger.    <br /> <br />Third season also has many of the references to Seventh-day Adventists, which totally cracks me up, as I have grown up in an SDA family.  And for anyone who cares, Seventh-day Adventist colleges do allow gum chewing and bowling, and guys and girls are now allowed to eat together and walk on the same sidewalks--though this was not always the case.  However, as a student at an SDA college, I've made my fair share of jokes about the conservative nature of my school.  So despite the errors in their facts, the jokes on Adventists are pretty funny to me.  There is one thing that bothers me: if Lane knew anything about Adventists, she would not pronounce it Ad-VEN-tist.  Every true Adventist pronounces it AD-ven-tist.  It's a dead giveaway of a poser.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I couldn't believe what I was hearing: for the first time ever, I fast-forwarded some parts on a DT album I listened to for the first time. This album is metal, not progressive metal. It definitely could be called System of a Korn Bizkit... They obviously learned to play faster, and want to show it. Mike, shame on you, you sound like any other metal drummer. Snare on the beats (or the off-beats, thank God). John, it's just about B-flat guitar riffs and solo's over them. James: both perfect and made crappy by crappy electronic effects Jordan: where are you? And stop the horror flick thing you started on Metropolis 2... On the plus note, the last one is not so bad, and the first 5 minutes of the instrumental are kind of cool. But what a disappointment. The king started to fall in Metropolis 2, went deeper wit 6doit and has competely fallen now... Please, DT, listen to what made you the great band you are. Believe me: we don't listen to your latest albums with the same heart. You lost the emotions you managed to keep until Falling Into Infinity... Be prog again.
B000083E79|5.0|By this point, Cher has released well over 30 to 40 albums. In 2003, while still on her farewell tour, which was appropriately titled, LIVING PROOF: THE FAREWELL TOUR, Cher released another greatest hits compiliation entitled, THE VERY BEST OF CHER. This greatest hits is a must-have Cher piece and contains just about every classic Cher song you really want. <br /> <br />BELIEVE  <br />From the album BELIEVE (1998). One of the best songs of 1998. Cher scored herself yet another #1 with this one. I even dedicated to my grandfather. I know that you are all saying, 'What is he thinking, dedicating a break-up song to his grandfather?' Well, my grandfather loved this song so much that I had to dedicate it to him.  <br /> <br />IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME  <br />From the album HEART OF STONE (1989). A song I have loved since day one. This song is nothing short of a classic and I cannot help but sing along with it each time I hear it. <br /> <br />HEART OF STONE  <br />From the album HEART OF STONE (1989). Another classic hit. Gotta love that acoustic guitar.  <br /> <br />JUST LIKE JESSE JAMES  <br />From the album HEART OF STONE (1989). Irresistible. Just irresistible to my ears. <br /> <br />SAVE UP ALL YOUR TEARS  <br />From the album LOVE HURTS (1991). This is another great song that I really enjoy listening to. You all do know that when Cher released the LOVE HURTS album, she actually wanted this to be the album's first single, but \\"Love And Understanding\\" was chosen as the first single from LOVE HURTS, whereas this one was chosen to be the second single.  <br /> <br />AFTER ALL (with Peter Cetera)  <br />From the original motion picture Chances Are (1988). From Cher's album HEART OF STONE (1989). A classic hit. I want to give you all a tip: whenever doing karaoke, don't ever do this one. I did this one with my cousin's girlfriend. I was fine with the solo parts, but until I got to the chorus, I screwed up left and right.  <br /> <br />I FOUND SOMEONE  <br />From the album CHER (1987). First off, the 1987 album, CHER, is Cher's second album that is self-titled, whereas the first self-titled album was released back in 1966. This song is actually not Cher's song; it is Laura Branigan's song. Laura Branigan had recorded this song and released it back in 1986, but it was never hit. Cher's rendition is way better and it was this rendition that became the major hit.  <br /> <br />ONE BY ONE (Junior Vasquez Vocal Edit)  <br />Original version from the album IT'S A MAN'S WORLD (1996). The album version is better, but this remix is definitely more groovier for you to dance your a** off.  <br /> <br />ALL OR NOTHING  <br />From the album BELIEVE (1998). This is anothe favorite track of mine from the BELIEVE album.  <br /> <br />SONG FOR THE LONELY  <br />From the album LIVING PROOF (2002). Cher dedicated this one to Governor Pataki, Mayor Gulianni, the firefighters, and the people of NYC. This is a great song and Cher is wise to dedicate it to the people of NYC. If I did this song, I would have dedicated it to them as well. This is one hell of a song.  <br /> <br />TAKE ME HOME  <br />From the album TAKE ME (1979). Gotta love Cher's disco era, where this song is placed there perfectly. Great dance song. <br /> <br />THE SHOOP SHOOP SONG (IT'S IN HIS KISS)  <br />From the original motion picture & soundtrack MERMAIDS (1990). So much better than the original, and the theme song to Cher's 1990 film, MERMAIDS, co-starring Winona Ryder & Christina Ricci.  <br /> <br />ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO  <br />From the album ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO (1965). A single that was taken from Cher's very first solo album. Not bad.  <br /> <br />BANG BANG (MY BABY SHOT ME DOWN)  <br />From the album THE SONNY SIDE OF CHER (1966). First off, Sonny Bono, Cher's former late partner and late ex-husband, had written this for her when Cher was recording for her second album entitled, THE SONNY SIDE OF CHER. This original Cher recording is not bad. In 1987, when Cher was recording for her album CHER, she decided to re-record this song, making it a Heavy Metal version, which can be found on Cher's album, IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME-CHER'S GREATEST HITS.  <br /> <br />HALF-BREED  <br />From the album HALF-BREED (1973). At first, I was never too fond of this song, but the more I heard it, the more I began to really like it.  <br /> <br />GYPSYS, TRAMPS, & THIEVES  <br />From the album GYPSYS, TRAMPS AND THIEVES (1971). It seems as though by the time Cher had gotten into the 70s, her music became even better than her 60s music. This song, which was, I think, her first #1 hit, is an example of her great early 70s sound.  <br /> <br />DARK LADY  <br />From the album HALF-BREED (1973). When this song was originally featured on the HALF-BREED album, Cher had then released it as a single before releasing the song again on the 1974 album, DARK LADY. So, just clear things up, this song was released as a single from HALF-BREED, and was later included on DARK LADY. This song makes me think of Cher as my Dark Lady. Great song. <br /> <br />THE BEAT GOES ON (performed by Sonny & Cher)  <br />From Sonny & Cher's album IN CASE YOU'RE IN LOVE (1966). I did not like this one at first, but I thought, 'Why not give it a second try? Maybe, I'll like it better than I thought'. So, I listened to it a second time and I don't regret that I did, because this is another classic, right behind the duo's ultimate classic, \\"I Got You Babe\\".  <br /> <br />I GOT YOU BABE (performed by Sonny & Cher)  <br />From Sonny & Cher's album LOOK AT US (1966). We all know that this was Sonny & Cher's biggest selling single and it will forever remain a classic. The first time I heard this song was when it was played at the end credits of the hit film, LOOK WHO'S TALING TOO. <br /> <br />A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG (Rodney Jerkins Main Mix Faster)  <br />  Original version from the album LIVING PROOF. The original is much better. <br />     <br />    This album is definitely oneof Cher's greatest compilations and it shows just how talented this truly incredible Diva is. If you have this album, then sit back and listen to only the best of Cher.
014100018X|5.0|<br />     Chocolat, by Joanne Harris is an intriguing novel about a delightful and slightly magical person that changes the lives of many people. <br /> <br />     This compelling novel is told through the eyes of two characters in a diary-like style.  The first point of view is Vienna Rocher's, a single mother who has moved into a small religious town with her daughter, Anouk.  In the town she opens a chocolate shop across the street from a church at the beginning of Lent. <br /> <br />     The other point of view is from Pere Reynaud, the priest of the town.  He sees Vienna as a pagan who has come to the area to corrupt his community with the sinful temptation of her chocolate shop. <br /> <br />      Throughout this book Reynaud battles with his insecure faith and temptations, while Vienna fights with her past, for her friends, and for her new business. <br /> <br />     Even though this book is from the eyes of only two characters, you learn about the lives of everyone who lives in the town; their secrets, conflicts, and personalities.   <br /> <br />     I loved the way Joanne Harris used very descriptive writing. <br />\\"The windows are open, and the through-draft would be cold if it were not for the heat of the stoves, the copper pans, the rising vapor from the melting couverture. The mingled scents of chocolate, vanilla, heated copper, and cinnamon are intoxicating.\\" <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading this book; I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a fun and humorous book that is still very deep.
B0002Y4T92|2.0|Where should I begin? Given that the cross-section of artists at this festival is so diverse, it makes it nearly imposible to cull a meaningful collection of music without having to cater to the greater listening audience which is kind of disappointing. The selection of songs on this set is what I really take issue with. Case in point, no Jeff Beck performances and shoddy-at-best performances by Joe Walsh and ZZ Top. Singular mediocre performances by Eric Johnson, Johnny Lang and Steve Vai, etc. I could go on and on about what could have and should have been on this set. Highlights however include Buddy Guy's performances, along with Robert Cray's. Clapton's \\"I Shot the Sherriff\\" (would you expect any other tune?) was pretty good as well. Probably the best guitar playing on the whole set is Vince Gill's finger picking on \\"Oklahoma Borderline.\\" Very impressive. I see that a lot of the glowing reviews are by people who were at the show. I myself was not and that drives home my point. If this is supposed to be the best of the festival I'm glad I didn't go. Just look at all the other reviews for this set and take this review accordingly and honestly. If you are a casual listener or intermediate musician than this set will be very entertaining. If, however, you are looking for something a little more inspiring, save your money.
B000268QB2|4.0|I don't like all the tracks on this album but I'll talk of the ones that instantly had me hooked. \\"Oh Simple Things/Where Have you gone?/I'm getting old and I need something to rely on....\\"<br /><br />I'd say beautiful around 40 times repeatedly for the entire length of \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and some people would think I have the disease Leonardo Di Caprio had in Aviator.Ever felt a tinge of revival of a feeling so lost and buried? Ever been unsung about a certain part of you that you thought had disappeared in time and all of a sudden felt it being revived?<br /><br />That's all that this song did to me.It's quite strange to find Keane in a time like 2004-2005. It makes me feel young and breathe a space of fresh air.Track 1 is also the best song on this album.<br /><br />\\"This is the last time\\" reminds me of Travis on their album Man Who but it has a nice live wire sound to it thanks to the uplifting vocals this man has. \\"Bend and Break\\" argues with me and somehow cannot be ignored. Without trying to sound offensive I hear a lotta music so I try not to look for answers and meanings in this song.<br /><br />\\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\" tries to be a happier watered version of Green Day's WHATSERNAME but fails miserably. Skip this track. Hell if I ever made music it would sound like this.<br /><br />Enter Track 5 and \\"everybody's changing\\" plays its wise,confident,appealing,\\"hook me up for a good day\\" melody.I just cant help but compliment Keane for this song.I must add I tried to dislike this song but its achingly catchy.It humbles me with its over magnified melody.Probably the 2nd best track on this album. Keane must have spent a year thinking about this track. It's one of the better track 5's I've heard in recent times.<br /><br />\\"Your Eyes Open\\" is a song that reminds me of pacing along at 40MPH on a lonely road at night.However that's about it because I soon realise I have too much good music to listen to this.<br /><br />\\"She Has No Time\\" is a stand out track.Its one of those tracks you would give to a girl you once used to know but then lost touch with. Maybe my ex. It's certainly one of those songs that bring out the best of Keane.Not gonna forget this in a hurry.<br /><br />\\"Sunshine\\" sounds amazing and is possibly the only song on HOPES AND FEARS with a bit of a haunt of a sound.It's like seeing a door opening in a dark room (much needed) Overall I'd give this track a 8/10.<br /><br />So there you have it. This album has all the makings of a great record. I think I will give this album more listens in the near future. It reminds me of good well deserved successful commercial music. I dont know if Keane will make it big but with solid tracks like \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" , \\"Everybody's Changing\\" , \\"Sunshine\\" , \\"She Has No Time\\" they bring out a semi-fan in me.<br /><br />God Bless Good Music. Don't get lost in a certain winter/summer of our lives,Keane.nd out track.Its one of those tracks you would give to a girl you once used to know but then lost touch with. Maybe my ex. It's certainly one of those songs that bring out the best of Keane.Not gonna forget this in a hurry. <br /> <br />\\"Sunshine\\" sounds amazing and is possibly the only song on HOPES AND FEARS with a bit of a haunt of a sound.It's like seeing a door opening in a dark room (much needed) Overall I'd give this track a 8/10. <br /> <br />So there you have it. This album has all the makings of a great record. I think I will give this album more listens in the near future. It reminds me of good well deserved successful commercial music. I dont know if Keane will make it big but with solid tracks like \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" , \\"Everybody's Changing\\" , \\"Sunshine\\" , \\"She Has No Time\\" they bring out a semi-fan in me. <br /> <br />God Bless Good Music. Don't get lost in a certain winter/summer of our lives,Keane. <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Haters...the more you hate, the more she's going to sell. So just step back and let it go because you're wasting your time. I'm sorry that Mariah has a great voice and I'm sorry that she made a great album. I've accepted it. Why can't you? I've come to terms with the fact that she's one of the greatest singers ever. I'm dealing with her undeniable knack for making hits. I'm no longer struggling with her ability to trump her critics at the drop of a dime. In time you will understand, as a 1-star reviewer, that you have made a complete fool of yourself repeatedly by posting lame reviews. One day you shall realize the gravity of your error. But until your day of realization, until your brain comes back from vacation, may I suggest an emancipation. I know you'll love it. Just risk the temptation. But should you not want to play along, and listen to Mariah's beautiful songs. I can sit here and write 5-star reviews all day long. Thank you. The End. <br /> <br /> <br />

Please... <br /> <br />The plot is wafer thin, ex-CIA, ala, Ludlum's hero, needs to be terminated, how the main character gives them hoodwink is the plot.  <br /> <br />The character development leaves a lot to be desired, you see many faces but know few well. Could you have blended more depth at least in the Italy chapters.  <br /> <br />Writing style is the same old, short sentences, with minimal variations in sentence structures. Good reason for a really quick read, once you see the pattern.  <br /> <br />Overall, a quick read on the flight from Boston to LA, if you are a fan of the chase/thriller genre.  <br /> <br />Yours thrill chasing reviewer,  <br /> <br />Fred \\"Grandstanding\\" Sanford

B0000AUHPB|5.0|The 60's Italian Job is well known to British audiences, for whom the movie is as regular a fixture of Christmas television scheduling as James Bond films, The Great Escape and the Queen's speech.  Negative reviews by US viewers are as much a result of the lack of a culture context and unfamiliarity with many of the ensemble cast.  The film has aged well and provides an amusing, if rather rose-tinted, snapshot of 60's British culture. <br /> <br />The cast includes Noel Coward as Mr Bridger, the criminal mastermind, and Michael Caine as the foppish Charlie Croker.  British audiences will recognise a host of well known actors in cameo roles, including Benny Hill and John Le Mesurier.  <br /> <br />The stars of the film though are undoubtedly the cars.  Amusingly, the array of 60's supercars including a Lamborghini Muira, E-Type Jaguars and Charlie's Aston Martin are overshadowing by the three Mini Coopers which lead the Italian police on an amazing car chase through Turin.  Remy Julienne and his stunt driving team produced one of the most amazing and well known, at least to British audiences, car chases on film.  Arguably it still rates as one of the best car chase sequences and all the more so because the stunts were actually filmed on location in Turin (and Coventry in the case of the sewer scenes) and in cars with minimal modifications. <br /> <br />There are many memorable moments in the movie beyond the Mini Cooper sequence.  Caine's 'blow the doors off', Benny Hill's larger lady obsessed Professor Peach on the tram in Turin and the 'hanging' ending stick out in my mind. <br /> <br />The extra features on the DVD are good but not truly outstanding.  The 'Making Of' documentary provides a number of interesting insights into the movie.  The commentary overlay track is a little stilted but worth a listen.  There is only really one deleted scene, the rather amazing 'Blue Danube' car ballet on ice. <br /> <br />In summary, this is a true British classic with a greatcast, score and storyline.  A nice snapshot of 60's London, a fantastic (at least for UK audiences) cast and the superb car chase scene make this one to buy.  The Hollywood remake, whilst not a bad movie in its own right, shares only the title, a storyline based on a gold heist and the updated BMW Mini with the original.   <br /> <br />And for anyone wondering about the original Mini's, they really are that small and that much fun to drive.
B000086EOB|5.0|No one who wasn't alive when this album was released should leave a review, because this was symbolic of the period in rock-n-roll (call it hair-band, I prefer to call it Metal) that a lot of us grew up listening to. Comparing this to modern metal is like comparing Johnny Cash to Alan Jackson...each is great in its own time, in its own way! And if you are thinking of buying this album, DO IT!!! it rocks! and also pick up the first album (self titled) WASP. I snuck into the office in high school, locked the door, and played the whole song \\"school daze\\" over the intercom before they stopped me. Later!

B00005A46T|1.0|NOISES NOISES PEOPLE MAKIE NOISES PEOPLE MAKE NOISES WHEN THEIR SICK! Bwahahahahahahahah!!! I was taking this album seriously until I heard that line. The lyrics are so funny!!! There's not really anything menacing on here, I mean, they try and all but it always goes awry e.g. `I wanna slit your throat and f*ck the wound' (a little scary) but rhyming it with `feel the swoon' made the whole line hilariously bad. You can't feel a swoon! The lyrics on here are embarrassing! I think slipknot are in quite a quandary as to what age group their target audience is. I heard it was 12-15. That worries me. When I was 12 I was listening to happy stuff like the eurhythmics, not music about serial killers. There's tons of swearing as well. If your kid listens to this I should panic if I were you. It could coheres them into thinking  how awful there life is (when its not that bad) etc, lets wait till they're older and keep them as chirpy and innocent as possible. I'm serious, this music really affects them. I'm going to tell an exemplary story now. I wouldn't want to waste your time into thinking this review was going to contain anything meaningful.  <br />Right here I go. I ended up visiting a mates house one day and being a busybody I decided to have a snoop round. Ya see, he had a little sister. She didn't come out her room much, but I thought she would like to have some company. Anyway I opened the door and was immediately greeted with slipknot posters everywhere. And I mean everywhere. The 4 walls and the ceiling. Well she was sat at her desk all in black wearing a slipknot hoody and she appeared to be making something. `How sweet' I thought, `arts and craft!' I sidled up gently as the whole room felt strangely inhospitable. `Watcha making?', I enquired. It turned out she was making a huge luminous devils star to hang out her window. The type that can be scene for miles. Now there's nothing wrong with that if say, she was into Wicca etc and this was a required part of her ritual, but the thing was, she wasn't, it didn't have a purpose, she just wanted to appear evil. Why? Because slipknot make evil cool. Evil without reason is ignorant and I can't stand things for shock value only, I like there to be an intelligent message behind it. When I rebuked her about it she pulled out a large pellet gun and took aim at my chest. I hastily retreated to the safety of her elder brother and asked why his little sister was so hostile. `It's that slipknot sh*t' he replied. Apparently now she was just another `maggot' who hated the world for no reason other then `its cool to hate the world'. I mean I know life's never a hundred percent fair but there she was, hating the world just to be in with the group, even though she lived in a nice house with a great family in a fairly good neighborhood. You need to recognize happiness while you have it. If her whole family perished in a house fire then perhaps I could allow her to listen to such hostile stuff. I mean why is Corey so angry? Why? Anger for angers sake is wrong. Get angry if something's worth getting angry about, not just for the sake of it. It's pointless. Kind of like this cd. Pointless. Got that?   <br />

If you want to know about the DVD (Ultimate Edition) read on... <br /> <br />The \\"Ultimate Edition\\" contains one single documentary on alien visitations, and the obligatory director's commentary.

B00006F7S4|3.0|This is the Beck \\"break up\\" album, recorded after his girlfriend of 9 years left. In \\"Hollow Log\\" (from \\"One Foot in the Grave\\"), he told us to \\"get yourself a pistol\\". Now, it seems like he's thinking about putting one in his mouth.<br /><br />Every song here is bathed in melancholy, making it very much a \\"mood album\\". There's not really anything upbeat...or even uptempo...to break the consistent plod. It's all resignation and no anger..didn't it piss Beck off that he put 9 years into the relationship and it's just over now? Or an \\"I'll show you..I can get any woman I want\\" song? It just seems like this is a whole album's worth of a single emotion.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />\\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" is understated and conveys its agony better by not overdoing it. (\\"It's only lies that I'm living/It's only tears that I'm crying/It's only you that I'm losing/Guess I'm doing fine\\") Single \\"Lost Cause\\" is Beck deciding it's not worth trying again. \\"Already Dead\\" proclaims him to be over her (\\"Love looks away/In the harsh light of the day/On the edge of nothing more\\") although the music belies the claim. You get the impression he's trying to convince HIMSELF, rather than the ex.<br /><br />LOW SPOTS:<br />There aren't any really BAD songs..but outside of the highlights, the album suffers from sameness. It's not easy to tell where one tune ends and the next begins sometimes.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />There's no denying that the huge production and swamp of strings make it SOUND like Beck's \\"big statement\\". But ultimately the songs underneath all the windowdressing can't always carry the weight of the tracks. It's a nice album if you want to just listen to the arrangements and say \\"Oh, how pretty...\\", but there's not a whole lot here to make an emotional connection to. It's also difficult to imagine throwing this on CD repeat.<br /><br />2 1/2 stars
B0000CDLA7|1.0|What can I say about this 'homage' that has not already been said? A total waste of time and talent is my opinion, they are akin to Genesis taking a break during 'The lamb..' and instead of looking ahead and trying something new, taking a break and doing an 'homage' to 60's soul music... Glas that DID NOT happen to Genesis, but DT seemed to have taken it upon themselves to be a 80s thrash metal band here for a CD. Do I actually hear the song 'Blackened' from Metallica's '88 album '..and justice for all' in there..I do! 'As I am' is DTs 'Enter sandman' and 'Stream of conciousness' is their 'Orion'. Oh dear, oh dear... SUCH a phenomenal waste of talent, energy and time. The MOST shocking thing to me is that most fans dont see it, but I guess most of them are the ones too young to ever see Metallica when they were not a pop band. I LOVE DT, especially 'Images and words', 'Six degrees..' and 'Metropolis2' but this is not the right way for them to go. Sure I made a few enemies now..

0385510454|3.0|This book had an interesting beginning, but the middle of this book dragged. It was like reading an italian language dictionary, just with some characters thrown in with minimal dialogue. If he had wasted a few more paged of Joel/Marco meeting luigi and going to lunch/dinner, and one more pointless class with ermanno, then I would have put it down. The ending however saved, it to the point of being passable. Little character developement as has been the case with the most recent yearly releases by Grisham. Wish he would take his time and create a well crafted story that had good developement like his earlier work. Id forgive him for not publishing for more than a year if he did that!
B00005JLEX|1.0|Red Skelton made me laugh.  The Honeymooners made me laugh.  Robin Williams and Bill Cosby make me laugh.  Chris Rock makes me laugh.  At the top of my all time list of shows and comedians that have never made me laugh, not even a snicker, snort, or chuckle, nay not even a smile is Seinfeld.  His stand up routine was self aggrandizing and boring.  His show was even worse.  Thank God there are thousands of other DVD choices in the world to fill the void of humor that this show has left in the world.

B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna is a very talented woman.  Very few artists can bring their career out for one decade, much less three.  But Madonna has done just that, mixing up the formula often to keep her fans interested.  Lyrically she stands strong, and the beats matches the mood of each song beyond well.  This is what makes American Life fun, she is able to stay deep without being overly metaphoric or depressing.  Instead, she can take any subject matter and make it a hit, and that is America Life.<br /><br />She started off by releasing the title track \\"American Life\\", which already created heavy controversy over the video.  Madonna dared to throw something that resembled a grenade at George W. Bush that turned out just to be a lighter, so eventually they had to re shoot the video.  Then she released a song about the corruption of the business in \\"Hollywood\\" as her second single, which was a good move on her part.  She also released her best single of the three last, \\"Love Profusion\\".  \\"Love Profusion\\" is a nice uplifting acoustic powered song that can appeal to just about everyone.  Before hand she also released \\"Die Another Day\\" for the 007 movie of the same title, which is also welcomed among the tracks.<br /><br />Elsewhere the album is great with \\"Easy Ride\\", the techno driven \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", and \\"X-Static Process\\".  But the albums true shining star is the lovely \\"Nothing Fails\\".  Lyrically it's the best on the album where she sings with passion \\"You could take all this, take it away/ I'd still have it all/ 'Cause I've climbed the tree of life/ And that is why, no longer scared if I fall\\" followed up by \\"I'm not religious/ But I feel so moved/ Makes me want to pray/ Pray you'll always be here\\".<br /><br />Maybe Madonna doesn't over do herself vocally on this album.  But I think that's an appeal to the album.  Much like Janet Jackson's Damita Jo, she didn't over do herself vocally, but that was what was good.  Instead they focus on sensual beats and poetic lyrics.  Madonna still proves that she is still dominating the world; focusing less on materialism and more on true spirituality.  American Life is tied to Evanescence's Fallen for my album of 2003, because while she may not compete with Amy vocally, is Amy able to reinvent herself with just about every album since the 80's?  No, and that's what makes Madonna the pop culture Material Girl she is today.onna still proves that she is still dominating the world; focusing less on materialism and more on true spirituality.

1400032717|4.0|This is one of the most enjoyable books I have read for a while.  It is written in a voice that draws you in from the start, and the whole book is constructed in such a way that you can't help be caught up in the story.  My only problem was the ending, which seemed somewhat ordinary given all the originality -- in words and pictures -- that had come before. (I may have been influenced by the fact that I had just read another novel with a similar ending -- so don't let me put you off reading this!)
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I was very surprised when  I first watched the movie.  Most of the reviews I have read of it were actually bad- this was on rottentomatoes.com and yahoo.  The movie, however, while I have not seen the live version, is very good.  The earlier reviewer who said it was romantic and the voices were very good is correct.  Gerard Butler brings a sensitivity and intensity to the phantom that made my breathe catch- my favorite song- Music of the Night- was fabulous.  Emily Rossum is beautiful and when she sings the song Think of me it is absolutely beautiful- the diamond pins in her hair and the dress!!  Her voice is perfect and the emotions she gives to the performance are lovely.  The score is intact and it is beautiful. The ending is so good- and when the phantom leaves - you can feel his emotions.  It is wonderful.

B00004RF9I|5.0|Mr. Chayevsky has made, easily, one of the greatest contributions to the art of cinema; one that transcends mere entertainment and holds court within the realm of the social, psychological, and political.<br />My fellow reviewers have been eloquent in pointing out the details, merits, and slight flaws within this movie.<br /><br />With the exception of the brutal murder on the air, every single outrageous idea that the film is now, 30+ years later, part and parcel of standard TV programming. The most banal mediocrities, the most mindless sensationalism, the most blatant lies, are all so common on modern TV that it not only goes unnoticed, but is accepted as being good programming. Even people who know they're looking at mind destroying garbage continue to watch it!! All fo this was warned about in the movie; all of it has come to pass.<br /><br />And still, we watch. We have no idea how the economy is controlled or who is making the decisions that will affect the lives of entire nations. We don't have a clue exactly why wars are fought, or even exactly what wars are being fought. We are blind to science, art, philosophy, and religion. we hardly bat an eye when we hear about industrial pollution on a biblical proportion, atrocities and genocide, or natural disasters wherein thousands of people die. But we know how things are going between Brad and Anjelina, who won last night's game, what soap star had sex with who, went into rehab, and what some loudmouth idiot with a talk show said that shocked and amused all of America the other day.<br /><br />This is what we have become; and Network warned us, every step of the way.<br /><br />But what I am impressed with is how the film exposes the horrifying economic and social realities of our time.<br />Ned Batty's brief scene in the conference room with Finch's Beale character has proven itself to be frighteningly accurate in its description of the disingenuous oligarchical tyranny we live under today. His explanation of the fact that there are no nations; only corporate entities, is exactly the world we live in - with the exception that the corporations are subservient to international banking cartels.<br /><br />No video collection should be without \\"Network\\": nobody can afford to ignore this film.<br /><br />For my own part, I refuse to permit television in my home.corporate entities, is exactly the world we live in - with the exception that the corporations are subservient to international banking cartels.

B0000CDLA7|1.0|can you tell? i can! This album is not good.  <br />In a way it's a shame I don't like it - it's been touted as Dream Theater's heaviest yet, closest to thrash metal, furthest from prog-metal. I like heavy metal; I like crunchy riffs; I don't mind a lack of melody. I saw Dream Theater cover Metallica's Master of Puppets in its entirety at a concert in New York, and it was awe-inspiring. I was hoping they'd take that early-Metallica influence and do something cool with it. Instead, they've come up with their most tedious album since... uh... their last one. Sigh.  <br /> <br />Train of Thought is tedious in an entirely different way than Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was. While it's chock full of similarly forgettable songs, they're forgettable mostly because they consist in large part of tired heavy metal riffs played really fast over. and. over. again. Keyboards play a much lesser role on this album; I never thought I'd miss the presence of Jordan Rudess (for a while I blamed him for Dream Theater's decline into suck-hood), but jesus! Anything to get Petrucci to quit showing off! Play Prog! <br /> <br />So, yeah - Train of Thought is basically devoid of memorable melodies (the ballad \\"Vacant\\" is laughable and extraneous); and although it contains a few riffs that are pretty potent, most of them sound recycled and, frankly, dull. And none of them are potent or interesting enough to sustain songs that almost invariably extend to ten exhausting minutes or more.  <br /> <br />This review might be a little overly harsh. It just pisses me off that a band I used to like so much, and a band with so much techincal talent, can put out such garbage. I mentioned on a message forum that maybe Dream Theater should just become a Metallica cover band instead of trying to write their own songs. These days, I'd like them much better that way. It's going to take a serious turnaround for these guys ever to get my attention again.  <br /> <br />Thank goodness I'm finished with this review, so I don't have to listen to this album ever again.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|I liked Avril Lavigne's first album-Let Go. For her age, she seemed very mature, her voice had a nice tone (minus skater boy)and although some lyrics were immature, the album was not overwhelmed by itm it seemed very sincere, and so did she.  <br /> <br />However, it is different on Under My Skin. This girl is supposed to be 19, but is ranting like a 13 year old to her parents. Her lyrics are mundane and simple. Sometimes that works, if the lyrics are chosen carefully, but here, Avril can say she wrote the lyrics, but if I were her, I'd toss the burden to someone else. The music is fine here, but she needs to learn how to fully utilize it.  <br /> <br />An example of this is on the song Slipped Away-the last track. This song is supposedly about the loss of her grandmother. Now, that is nice and emotive, with lyrics like: <br />\\"The day you slipped away, was the day I found it won't be the same\\" are relatable, but the \\"na na, na na\\" of the opening entrance is laughable, and so juvenile and typical of the immaturity that peeps through every song she tries to pass off as deep and it it erases the seriousness of the subject matter. <br />This also seen on the song Together, a song about not feeling good about oneself when around another. This is a nice song, with  a good piano melody and rock atmosphere as well. She sings loudly: \\"Together, it doesnt feel right all, together we built a wall. That was a good chorus until\\"...holding hands we'll fall\\" and you just scream out: What?? This continues on in song after song. They all had a lot of potential. <br /> <br />In conclusion, Avril Lavigne screams about her independence and ability to do whatever she wants, but for a 19 year old, this is all pretty childish and simplistic things she is talking about(minus the song, Slipped Away which I feel is very sincere)-and that is fine, as many people can relate, but the music doesn't match it, and takes the album down a notch. I hope for a better Avril Lavigne record, as she matures.
B00005UKKF|5.0|One of the best Britney's tour.. nothing compared with the onyx hotel tour... <br />i love all the performances
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I love The Breakfast Club. What really makes the movie a classic are the realistic dynamics between the characters. I don't think there is an unrealistic moment-or at least an ungenuine acting moment in the movie. Bender's sarcasm and brashness stand out, you want to dislike him, but somehow you cant. You like Brian, although he is a geek, but you know that even he has his negative perceptions about the \\"criminal\\" like everyone has about him.  <br /> <br />Sure, Andy's a jock, but he is also a nice guy-a rarity. Claire hates doing what her friends want her to do, and so she is not as independent and envy worthy as eveyone may think a popular girl should be. And Alison-the \\"basketcase\\" (does anyone use that term anymore?) she is just odd, but like claire, we don't find her disturbing, or \\"cool\\" as she says either, just kind of....different, and for that, she is just as likable. The witty dialogue is good as well. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this movie, please do!  I do not think you will regret it!
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden achieves their best mix of impressive and mature instrumentation along with superb songwriting on this album.  Aces High and 2 Minutes to Midnight are as good as any metal songs ever!  Don't overlook Rime of the Ancient Mariner and the title track, as they are also excellent.  The guitar work is noticeably more developed and honed than on earlier albums, and the songs are energetic and well-written.  If you only buy one Iron Maiden album, make it Powerslave.
0385491026|4.0|Margaret Atwood's \\"Cat's Eye\\" is a fascinating and immensely detailed work that deals with the interaction between adulthood and childhood, as well as the relationship between art, artists, and interpretation. The symbolic connections within the book are staggering, and unless it is read within a fairly short period, the reader is likely to forget some of the important symbols and miss key insights into Elaine's relationship with her childhood foil Cordelia.  <br /> <br />That said, this book is not without flaws. Like Ondaatje, Atwood suffers from a serious case of smug narrator syndrome. At times, I felt the urge to groan aloud at the sheer corniness of Elaine's musings, especially in the frame narrative of 1980s Toronto. However, Atwood's rendering of the protagonist's childhood traumas are captivating, and wonderfully excruciating to read. Nine-year-old girls have never seemed so insanely cruel, and the effect of this treatment on Elaine's adult life, as well as her art, is perfectly captured. Navigating art, feminism, psychology, aging, and memory, Atwood creates a kind of fractured bildungsroman in which lessons are forgotten and memories suppressed, only to resurface in the ambiguous medium of Elaine's painting.  <br /> <br />In terms of criticisms, I would agree with other reviewers that after Elaine's childhood, the narrative loses some steam. While the events of her later life are important to an understanding of Elaine's situation in the frame narrative, there is a sense that the events that allow us to fully understand Elaine as a character occur about mid-book. After that, things begin to drag a bit. Furthermore, the clichd narrative voice often gets in the way of connecting and identifying with the protagonist. However, it is interesting to see how the events and symbols of the narrator's childhood resurface in a complex web connecting the past and present.  <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this book, but with a warning to those who already have a bias against Atwood's style. If you give it a chance, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. But, if you already dislike Atwood, this book will not change your mind.
B000063DI9|5.0|I'm not sure why this album is criticized on the other reviews.  It is one of my favorite Maiden albums, and it is apparent that the songwriting has come a long way since Number of the Beast.  I would put it behind only Powerslave in rankings of Maiden albums.  The songwriting and creativity (not to mention orchestration) that go into this album surpass that of any other Maiden album.  There really isn't a single weak song on this album, but the \\"stand-outs\\" (if there can be stand-outs on a concept album) would have to be Moonchild, Clairvoyant, and Can I Play With Madness.  Listen to this several times; it will grow on you.  Not as catchy as some of Maiden's other work, but definitely their most musically complicated and refined effort.  Up the Irons!
B00005LMBK|5.0|ok, i just started to listen to gorillaz three weeks ago when they had Feel good Inc. on itunes. I feel in love after i listened to it once. You can not describe gorillaz in any way. They say its hiphop or rock or anything, its not. They in a way craeted their own type of music. Ihave never heard an album like this one. Many albums all their songs sound the same, so if you have heard a differents band single, and none of their others, you could listen to a song and go \\" Hey that sound like \\" That Band\\". \\" when you listen to gorillaz, all of their songs sound different in their own way. You could listen to it forever and still be pleased. I say bye it. If not , you may miss out in alot to come in the near future.........
B000059PPN|4.0|I have long been a Fulci fanatic and this film, \\"House By The Cemetery,\\" delivers the goods in spades. <br /> <br />The story is simple, if not altogether derivative. A young family moves from their cramped New York apartment into a spacious New England mansion. What sets this place apart from their previous abode, however, is the presence of the home's original owner, the detestable Dr. Freudstein. It would seem that he has been hiding in the home's shuttered basement for the last 100 years, picking off stray dwellers of the house and using their fluids and various other organs to sustain his own decomposing body. Sound far-fetched? Well, it should. But don't let that deter you. This is not \\"Rebecca From Sunnybrook Farm\\" or \\"Meet John Doe\\" we're talking about. It's a horror film with all the trademark gore and over-the-top violence we've come to expect from Lucio Fulci. Not high art by any stretch, but certainly never boring either. Definitely worth a purchase, especially if, like me, you happen to be a fan of this stuff. <br /> <br />The Anchor Bay DVD is absolutely first-rate with a pristine transfer and some cool theatrical/T.V. trailers.
B000002OZY|4.0|<br />...but only OK as an album. <br /> <br />This one is interesting in that it ranks high in all other categories except listenability.  I like many of the songs, but listening to them all straight through is exhausting.  Most are very catchy and singable, which is both a blessing and a curse.  After I heard them a few times, I got tired of them, yet they stayed in my head for weeks.   <br /> <br />If you're new to The Who, or to classic rock, it's required listening.  It's a big part of history and the evolution of rock.  It was ahead of its time, not just in terms of the music, but also the format and the subject matter.  Townshend, at his peak, was one of the most creative songwriters and best rhythm guitarists.  This album showcases his talents. <br /> <br />Many of the songs have been played to death on the radio.  But imagine hearing this album when it first came out in '69.  It's important to keep this in mind when listening. <br /> <br />Songwriting: 10/10  <br />Musicianship: 10/10  <br />Sound Quality: 10/10  <br />Originality: 10/10 <br />Listenability: 7/10

B00004Y6O9|4.0|The first time I heard this, I was blown away, and played it countless times after that.      Most of the best songs are those you've already heard on radio play lists.  The less popular tracks are relatively weak, but should not be confused with filler.  Remember, this is 1978.  VHI was fresh, new, and experimental.  The style and guitar techniques were revolutionary, and had a great deal of influence on the best (and worst) of 80s metal.    It's important to take this album in historical context, before countless hair bands turned some great techniques and sounds into bad cliches.

B000002JSN|5.0|I am not a die-hard Led Zeppelin fan. But I have come to have enormous respect for the quartet of Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham. I have come to realize that the efforts of a great work ethic have produced some of the stuff that legends are made of - and Led Zep takes the cake. Led Zeppelin's roots are in the Blues - thanks to lead singer Robert Plant and guitarist Jimmy Page who have always been a big fan of this type of music.   If you look at the early albums by Led Zeppelin, these roots are evident.   As their careers progressed, Led Zeppelin built a hard rock edge to their music on top of their blues music and soon were recognized as one of the most innovative bands in Rock.   One album that demonstrates such a sound is the 1975 double album by Led Zeppelin entitled \\"Physical Graffiti\\".   In a lot of ways, this was a landmark album and solidified what would become Led Zeppelin's legendary status. <br /> <br />This is a complete album by the quartet.  On every track you can hear the contributions - whether it's Robert Plant's vocals, Jimmy Page's guitar, John Paul Jones' Keyboards and Bass, or John Bonham's drums.  From a songwriting standpoint, all four members make contributions to the 15 track 2-CD set.  This is enhanced by the fact that Jimmy Page himself remastered this collection.    One interesting fact is that 7 tracks were recorded before 1974.   This implies that these are songs that never made it on to Led Zeppelin albums.  It's hard to believe that songs such as \\"The Rover\\", \\"Down By the Seaside\\", \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\", \\"Houses of the Holy\\",  \\"Night Flight\\", \\"Boogie with Stu\\", and \\"Black Country Woman\\" are \\"leftovers\\". <br /> <br />Even the casual music fan is familiar with Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".   This song was off their 1971 album known as \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\".   This song is generally considered the greatest Classic Rock song of all time.   There is no doubt that \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is an all-time great song.  However, I feel Led Zeppelin have done two songs that are on the same level as \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" - and both of these songs are found on \\"Physical Graffiti\\".  The songs are \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" and \\"Kashmir\\".  \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" might not have the intricate lyrics that 'Stairway to Heaven\\" had, but this song is about the instrumentation.   This particular song has a feel for a jam session.   This song does have some blues roots - it is loosely based on Robert Johnson's 1936 blues song \\"Terraplane Blues\\".  However, make no mistake about it - this is an intense Zeppelin song through and through.  While Jimmy Page and John Bonham play guitar and drums respectively at the level you would expect, it is Robert Plant and John Paul Jones who are the real stars of this song.  Plant's passionate and intense vocals echo the intense instrumentation by the rest of the band.   As for John Paul Jones, his use of the keyboards are really what bring this song up a level - terrific.  Not to be judgmental, but as for the lyrics, references to car parts are used as metaphors for sexual references. <br /> <br />\\"Kashmir\\" is a very different song than both \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" and \\"Stairway to Heaven\\".  This is not a Blues-rooted song, but Zeppelin innovation through and through. At the same time, this song doesn't have the feel of a jam session, but in some ways has some middle-eastern orchestral qualities.  In a lot of ways, this was experimental musical territory that Led Zeppelin was embarking on. \\"Kashmir\\" actually refers to an area of land that is disputed by Pakistan, India, and China.   This song was actually written by Robert Plant as he was traveling through North Africa in the Sahara desert (which ironically is still a far distance from Kashmir, but Plant envisioned himself driving all the way from Morocco to Kashmir).   The song has a distinct middle-eastern flair and basically gives you the feeling of traveling in that part of the world.  Once again - each member of Zeppelin: Plant, Page, Jones, and Bohnam all make major contributions to the sound.  However - Plant and Jones rise to the occasion again.  Plant demonstrates some terrific vocal ranges, while Jones' Bass, Keyboards, and String arrangements are some of the best ever heard. <br /> <br />There are other terrific tracks on this collection.   The opening two tracks, \\"Custard Pie\\" and \\"The Rover\\" have their roots in blues.  \\"Custard Pie\\" is one of those songs that takes a while to get into. You can definitely see how many hard rockers followed the innovations set by Zeppelin when you listen to this track.   \\"The Rover\\" starts out with some Country-Blues sound, but then progresses to a hard rock sound.  It has a terrific instrumental opening.  Another good blues track is the retro sounding \\"Boogie With Stu\\".  While the final track \\"Sick Again\\" has a blues sound, it almost sounds like a prototype for the Heavy Metal sound. <br /> <br />Another very good song is \\"Night Flight\\" - this song often gets overlooked, but it another complete effort by the quartet - more great keyboards by John Paul Jones.  Other highlights include the instrumental \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\", the classic \\"The Wanton Song\\" (featuring great drums by Bonham), and \\"Ten Years Gone\\".  Experimentation is alive and well on this collection.  You will hear this in the slightly psychedelic \\"In the Light\\".  Another overlooked, yet what I would consider an experimental song is \\"Down By the Seaside\\".   I call this song Led Zeppelin's experiment with some Hawaiian sounds - great stuff and great vocals by Plant.  <br /> <br />While the songwriting and production credits are included, I am very disappointed there were no lyrics included in this collection.   The only \\"extra\\" is you get in the liner notes is the \\"where\\" and \\"when\\" this song was recorded.  Overall, this is perhaps the finest collection by Led Zeppelin that they have released.  Highly recommended.
B00001OH7P|5.0|<br />Although it is considered a concept album of sorts, it doesn't get bogged down in themes or complex stories.  It didn't even occur to me that it was a concept album, until someone mentioned it.  That's part of the beauty: you can enjoy the songs as songs. <br /> <br />The production is crisp and high-quality, but not overdone.  Despite the sci-fi theme, it has a good balance of dirty rock-and-roll crunch, so that it stays down-to-earth, and not too geeky, artsy, or spaced-out (\\"Suffragette City\\" is a good example). <br /> <br />If you get this album, it's worth checking out the lyrics online, if they're not included with the cd.  Some of them are funny, warped, and surreal, in a good way.  I'm not always into lyrics, but Bowie is like the Bob Dylan of glam, and knowing the lyrics has enhanced the listening experience for me. <br /> <br />In terms of listenability, this album is listenable all the way through, with no skips.  It is very much an album, not a hits-and-filler collection. <br /> <br />Lots of hooks and grooves.  Great to sing along in a British accent. <br /> <br />Songwriting: 9/10  <br />Musicianship: 9/10  <br />Sound Quality: 10/10  <br />Originality: 10/10 <br />Listenability: 10/10
B000002UAI|5.0|I don't care what anyone says. Mick Jagger's singing doesn't hold a candle to that of Lennon or McCartney, Keith Richards is a druggie, and my grandmother plays drums better than Charlie Watts, and she has no arms! This is a great album from start to finish. Right off the bat, you're hit with No Reply, I'm A Loser, Baby's In Black, Rock And Roll Music, and I'll Follow The Sun, all classics in my book. Then you have the up-beat Kansas City/Hey Hey Hey Hey medly along with Eight Days A Week and I Don't Wanna Spoil The Party. I will admit that Ringo isnt at his best with Honey Don't, and Words of Love and What You're Doing are somewhat dull, but face it. The classics are all here. This is a fantastic album.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|will begin by saying what other negative reviews have also stated: I am a fan of Dream Theater and have been for a while. I have all the albums...well, save for one. I don't have \\"Train of Thought\\" because I sold it, even though I am usually a completist when it comes to bands I like. That is how disappointing I found this album. And I will tell you why it is so terrible.  <br /> <br />The defenses seem to begin with \\"well if you're looking for that same old prog sound this isn't for you.\\" First of all, the idea of being a progressive rock band doesn't mean you have to necessarily sound the same and not evolve. That is a naive implication. Secondly, no, I'm looking for good music. I'm looking for a mature artistic statement by musicians I respect. This album is regressive and immature. I was already disappointed with a significant portion of \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" but this is ridiculous. It sounds like a group of metal head Dream Theater fans that went to the Musicians Institute. It sounds like five twenty year olds that recently discovered the realm of music not played by Clear Channel radio stations. It does not sound like five accomplished adults with a rich mold-breaking musical catalogue to their credit. This album brought with it a barrage of cheesy effects that most people use to mask their musical shortcomings along with song structures that are week and choppy. They had great song structures that were progressive and made sense but now it seems like a string of poor interpretations of progressive song structuring. I got tired of the non sequitur changes and the lack of any true groove. One thing I've always loved about them was their ability to transition and change time signatures but there is a way to do that right which requires finesse and maturity. That is, for some reason, absent here. And where did Myung go? Did he take a vacation? Because I didn't hear any of that great bass work that so grandly complimented their previous material. Cometo think of it I didn't here many harmonies and melodies at all. Nothing. I don't care how difficult you make it to execute it's just noise. Anyone can make noise and they do.  <br /> <br />Between reviews I've read and people I have spoken with I have noticed that it has been common to justify the sound by simply saying it's of a different musical genre. Well, I'm sorry to break it to you but that is simply not enough. The prinicples of music do not change from one genre to another. What makes something good and relevant is consistent, regardless of simplicity and complexity. \\"Train of Thought\\" was an excruciating letdown that I hope Dream Theater doesn't deal me again. But I gotta tell you, because of the trend displayed by their last two studio releases, I'm going to be far more cautious about my purchase of the upcoming.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I got this album for Christmas almost immediatly after it was released. It was probably the greatest gift I have ever been given because it was this album that made me really appreciate the musical ingenius of the Beatles. Now, they are my favorite band of all time and I own all of their albums. John Lennon is a genius and one of the greatest poets of our time. I was born ten years after John Lennon died. It really makes me mad that this man had so much left to offer and was taken from us so thoughtlessly. Capture the best of the Beatles in this album. As I became more familiar with the Beatles, there are some songs I found (such as Blackbird, Dear Prudence, Tell Me What You See, I'll Follow The Sun, And Your Bird Can Sing, For No One, and I've Got A Feeling) that I feel should belong in a greatest hits collection. Maybe if we're lucky, the next Beatles greatest hits album will be a double album. Long live The Fab 4, long live John Lennon, long live music, and LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED.
B0007ZEBI0|5.0|This DVD-A/DTS disc is as outstanding as the In Absentia release which won the award for best Surround Mix. It not only has both  DVD-A and DTS formats but also has a full PCM Stereo recording of Deadwing included along with three extra DTS Surround tracks: Revenant; Mother and Child Divided, and Half-Light. Not much else to say except, BUY IT!! You won't be disappointed.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|When I heard this was out I was absolutely thrilled!  I bought it last week and watched the whole thing (over 5 hours worth).  The 90 minute documentary section is absolutely great, speaking with former Maiden members Paul Dianno, Clive Burr, Dennis Stratton, and a BUNCH of other guys you probably never knew were in the band before that!  Other interviews are with guys like Martin Birch, who produced Maiden's best albums, Neal Kay, a DJ from London's East End who broke Maiden into the scene playing their records, and a ton of roadies, managers, fans & friends.   <br /> <br />Along with all this great stuff is early concert footage from 1980 at The Ruskin Arms to the last show of the World Piece Tour at Dortmund.  My favorite footage is Live At The Rainbow, Beast Over Hammersmith, and the Dortmund show.   <br /> <br />If you're a Maiden fan this is a treasure trove of goodies!  A note to those who maybe aren't a big fan of Maiden, you probably won't dig this like us Maiden freaks, but for us, the chosen few, it's great, great stuff!
B00005JMAH|2.0|This new chronicle in the Harry Potter sequence is nowhere near worthy of the rosy ratings of most reviews because of two simple reasons. <br /> <br />The first of these is the acting.  I feel that the actors preformed their parts well, but I have several major qualms with the new director, Alfonso Cuaron, about his choices for the portrayal of the characters.  The first major flop was Dumbledore.  The actor played the part well, and retained the look and sound of the old Dumbledore, but the lines and intonation were appalling.  The literary purpose of Dumbledore is as a source of safety and comfort for Harry, but this movie lost all of that.  The primary problem was that Dumbledore lost all of his appeal to the audience because he no longer retains that indelible Dumbledore quality of warmth.  He was brisk, snappish, and terse in his addresses to the students, and this is a serious departure from the caring and deep Dumbledore we met in the first two movies.  The theatrical lighting also enhanced this new image: the first two movies had a great deal of yellow and orange light, while the color swatch for this was more toward the cooler colors such as blue.  The other acting difficulty is apparent by even looking at a poster for the movie; Harry is no longer the central character.  After seeing this film, I came away with the impression that Hermione had achieved dominance in the film titled Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  This is but one of the two major reasons that this movie is barely worthy of two stars out of five. <br /> <br />The other reason that this movie disappoints me is the content.  While I have to admit that all of the sequences shown in the movie were very good, it is what is not shown that is the most distressing.  The Harry Potter books have a unique charm resulting from Rowling's phenomenal ability to characterize, the intense reality of the world she weaves, and her ability to build a plot rich with intrigues out of minor supporting details.  And her characterizations often occur alongside her sublime plot details, which only add to her skill as a writer.  But this movie only barely manages to capture the world she wrought in The Prisoner of Azkaban, and loses the plot entirely.  Too many things were left out, many of which left viewers puzzled.  For example, when Lupin revealed to Potter that he knew how to use the Marauder's Map, none of the characters batted an eyelash.  Moreover, the entire subplot about Harry's father was omitted; this included who \\"Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, Prongs\\" were, the fact that they were all Animagi, or wizards who can transform into animals, or why Harry's patronus was a stag.  I feel that this is likely connected to Harry no longer being a central character in the movie bearing his name.  Overall, I feel that this movie strays dangerously close to what Christopher Coloumbus alluded to wanting to do with the Harry Potter series, take all the action sequences from all the books, and combine them into a single movie. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I feel that this film seriously undermines the characters and mutilates the plot.  By changing the character focus and leaving out central story elements, this movie not only poorly portrays this book, but also changes things so considerably that it will be a huge hurdle to recover from these blunders in the Harry Potter movies to come. <br />
B00008OLYN|5.0|I am not a \\"death metal\\" fan at all and believe me there is no album out there in that genre that will get an \\"outstanding\\" rating from me.  Still, I think within that genre Opeth stands out due to the complex music and their use of transitions between the profane and the sublime keping things interesting.  But \\"Damnation\\" is no death metal album.  Instead it sheds signatures of that genre and concentrates on what I think Opeth really does best: the textures within the music.   This album is incredible.  The vocals are expressive and melodic, and the musicianship is fantastic. <br /> <br />The thing is, some say that with this album Opeth has lost their use of contrasting heavy with light music.  Perhaps in volume and tone, but the contrast is there.  The music is melodious and beautiful, but listen closely and the sentiment in them is dark and disturbing, and occasionaly feels like a punch in the gut.  Listen to \\"Closure\\" for example; first time through you enjoy the interesting eastern influences of it.  Second time through you catch what the song is about and your heart skips a beat.  I'd say that rather than losing the constrasting elements, they've fused them. This is powerful stuff, give it at least two listens to really begin to feel it.
0060516070|5.0|This is a superbly written guide for executives regarding how to become more effective. After reading this book, I adopted several suggestions that Drucker made and I must say that the results have been quite dramatic. For instance, I was able to cut down unproductive meetings considerably by eliminating things like \\"no meetings without a clear agenda.\\" Common sense but rarely followed in the corporate world. <br />
B0007TKNL0|4.0|As a big fan of the musical, this movie adaptation was really well done. The music is wonderfully intact, some of the sequencing makes more sense (e.g. chandelier crash toward end), and the black and white present day scenes  are beautifully done.  The leads are good, especially Christine. Butler's vocals don't pare up to the unparalleled Michael Crawford, but his acting is excellent, especially the Masquerade scene.  Missed the full Red Death get-up, but I guess Butler's emoting would not have been as powerful talking through a huge skull-head!  In the musical, the Phantom is always one step ahead and somewhat above the regular folks, adding to the mystery. He seems to perform almost magical stunts on several occasions, e.g. causing Carlotta's croaking, disappearing from Masquerade ball in a puff of smoke, shooting fireballs, gesturing the portcullis up, and the last scene disappearing act. We always felt like the Phantom had some supernatural element about him.    Interestingly, ALW and Shumacher take pains to reveal the Phantom going through his machinations: Locking Christine's door, Meg revealing the sliding mirror, dropping through the floor from Masquerade ball where Raoul follows, and most obviously, the sword fight that he loses! Quite a difference from the stage version.  Then, at the end, they bring back the magic. Had they ended with the Phantom simply escaping through a shattered mirror, it would have been a huge letdown. But the cemetery scene, with sad, oboe-tinged music, and the rose w/ring, obviously placed there recently, was the perfect ending.         Very much a worthy adaptation.
0345409671|5.0|Memnoch the Devil left me absolutely breathless as did all vampire chronicles leading up to this one. Anne Rice's books have quickly become my favorite books, and Lestat my favorite character. I thought that this book, although not my favorite in the vampire chronicles series, was compelling and beyond imaginative and completely captivating! Any one with an open mind will realize that this book is complete genius. I really don't think it matters at all whether or not you agree with Ms. Rice's views of heaven and hell or not; what matters is that this book makes the reader ask questions about their beliefs and really truly THINK. We have to realize that writing is an art form and that Anne Rice manages to tell us a tale about ideas we are already familiar with (such as God and the Devil) and yet Memoch the Devil challenges these ideas and simultaneously makes us fall in love with them. I think that readers have never been so fully given a character such as Lestat, who epitomizes human nature and meshes it with his vampire existence perfectly. Personally, I have never been able to relate to a character so much. As Lestat questions all that is presented to him, you will question it too. I liked Memnoch more than God in this book. Memnoch provided a perfect sort of antagonist to this story and to Lestat's ongoing story. Memnoch skillfully challenges Lestat in a way that only the Devil could. And maybe the Devil IS the only suitable challenger for Lestat...Memnoch the Devil is anything but disappointing. It is creative and smart and beautiful in every sense of the word. Anne Rice fans will not feel disappointed. Memnoch the Devil truly makes the reader become completely engulfed this story's wonderful creativity.
B000002JS8|5.0|1. Highway To Hell---10/10      great way to start of the album.  2. Girls Got Rhythm ---9.5/10    3. Walk All Over You---11/10   great energetic song  4. Touch Too Much--11/10 somthing different from all other acdc songs, kind of reminds me of def leppord for some odd reason.  5. Beating Around The Bush---9.5/10  6. Shot Down In Flames---9.5/10  7. Get It Hot---8.5/10  8. If You Want Blood---10/10 another energetic song  9. Love Hungary Man---9/10  10. Night Prowler---9.5/10  good tune    overall: 9.5/10
B00025ETIW|4.0|For the most part, I think MCR used to be a cult band.  A few guys out to play the music they love and base it on something that would be kind of different.   <br />I'm guessing Gerard way decided on a gothic theme to go along with their already established punk melodies.  If we look at some of their video's and footage we can tell they poke fun at all the things they represent.  The only exception being Helena, which I think is the only serious song on the album. <br /> <br />The rest of there songs seem to circle around the whole killer guy concept. <br /> <br />The music on Three cheers is solid too.  It's not original and I have heard much better, but props to them for keeping a solid image while also playing decent music with lyrics that actually provoke thought. <br /> <br />All in all I like Three Cheers.  People will say they are gay.  But who cares if they are.   <br />People will say they wear  makeup.  That really doesn't matter because it's been done before. <br />And that's my only complaint, MCR is basicly a band that draws all it's perk from other past bands such as Misfits, Letterkills, Alexisonfire, TBS, and Thursday.  Just to name a few. <br /> <br />But other than that, this is a good band, and album.
B000268QB2|5.0|Response to: \\"I bought the CD for the first song. My initial feeling was that tracks 1 and 3 were great, the rest were just average. The more you listen the more it grows and you realise just how much magic there is in this music. It may sound simple at the start, until you realise that its actually pretty clever and to the point. I think this band is going to grow into something big. \\" <br />My exact experience when i bought the cd. The songs grow on you. The more you listen, the more you love them. Keane is true talent. Buy this cd and i promise you will not regret it, i sure didn't. THE BEST CD I Have EVER BOUGHT
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I was worried this would not live up to the stage version,  but I had nothing to worry about.  This movie had me all the way through.  Gerard Bulter is a wonderfully sexy phantom.  The rest of the cast is just as good.  I would highly recommend.
B000002KYH|3.0|Rod Stewart is a great live performer, but this 1982 live album does not do him justice. Though there are some occasional shades of greatness, \\"Absolutely Live\\" falls flat for the most part.<br /><br />As one reviewer pointed out, it's the first half of the album where the problems lie. Rod stumbles his way through inadequate performances of \\"Passion\\" and \\"Sweet Little Rock And Roller\\". \\"Hot Legs\\" is good but not great. \\"Tonight's The Night (Gonna Be Alright\\" and \\"You're In My Heart (The Final Acclaim\\") are simply horrifying.<br /><br />The second half of the album is where the bright spot lies. The performance of \\"Young Turks\\" works well without the synthesized instruments and such, transforming into a barroom rocker. Rod's megahits \\"Maggie May\\" and \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\\" sound as fresh and vibrant as ever, while \\"Gasoline Alley\\", \\"Sailing\\" and \\"I Don't Want To Talk About It\\" are emotional powerhouses. Finally, the closing \\"Stay With Me\\" with Kim Carnes and Tina Turner is the best song on the whole album. the only bad song here is \\"Tear It Up\\".<br /><br />Overall, this album would make a good addition to your Rod collection, but by no means is this an essential purchase. If you want to see a truly great Rod Stewart concert\\", get the \\"Storytellers\\", \\"It Had To Be You...\\" and \\"...Royal Albert Hall\\" dvds. Those are truly great concerts.
B0007WZUMO|4.0|this will be a quick review, i bought this cd on the day it released so my views may be slightly jaded on this album but on the whole i believe it continues on the path the band has been on for some time now. Not  the greatest album in any sense but still a solid album by a genius of a musician.
B000002WUD|5.0|Though by no means his most successful period, the last seven yeats of Elvis Presley's life (1970-77) were arguably when he made his finest work. This five cd boxed set is the best representation of all of his best work from the 1970s'.<br /><br />Discs 1 and 2 contain all the singles he released during this period. In addition to his final two top ten singles from this era (\\"The Wonder Of You\\" and the scorching \\"Burning Love\\"), there's some less fondly remembered singles such as \\"Where Did They Go Lord\\", \\"Until It's Time For You To Go\\", \\"I've Got A Thing About You Baby\\" and \\"Hurt\\". Also, most of the b - sides are here, so great tracks like \\"Patch It Up\\", the haunting \\"Life\\", and \\"We Can Make The Morning\\" get their due.<br /><br />Disc 3 contains the hits from 1970 to 1971. Though it's a relatively brief period, there's a wealth of great stuff here, including \\"Just Pretend\\", \\"Funny How Time Slips Away\\", \\"I Washed My Hands In Muddy Water\\" and \\"Snowbird\\". The whole disc is great, but these are just some of the best numbers.<br /><br />Disc 4 contains material from 1971 to 1976. This cd contains a ton of great stuff. Among the highlights: a chilling unreleased cover of \\"My Way\\", the funky \\"I've Got A Feelin' In My Body\\", the mellow \\"You Asked Me To\\", the eerie \\"Good Time Charlie's Got The Blues\\", the upbeat \\"Talk About The Good Times\\" and his stunning version of \\"Danny Boy\\". This is the best disc.<br /><br />Disc 5 is concert material, which is excellent. Among the highlights are energetic performances of \\"Walk A Mile In My Shoes\\", \\"Let It Be Me\\". \\"A Big Hunk O'Love\\" and \\"Unchained Melody\\", as well as some great rehearsal recordings.<br /><br />This is an amazing look at Elvis's final years. Definitely worth owning.
B00004LN16|5.0|My only criticism of this CD is that the title tune is so good, the rest of the CD is sort of a letdown.  But the whole album is still good--perhaps AC/DC's best since Razor's Edge.  I didn't find one clunker on the album.  It's not their best, but still a 5-star production.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I recently lost my Irish husband so this album is truly special to me.  He would listen to all the Irish programs and singers that he could find, and really instilled in me a great love for the Irish and the celtic music. I believe this album represents the best in Irish music. These five woman have outstanding voices, all very beautiful with such clear tones. <br /> <br />When I feel sad and lonely, I play this music and it lifts up my spirit. Hard to name a favorite here, but I always cry when I hear \\"You Lift me up\\". His favorite was Danny Boy, so what more can I say.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|Being a Woman- I like the songs that emphasize more vocals- Past Dream Theater songs really got me into this band- (and my husband showing me the songs) When he bought this album I was very excited to hear it- after listening to it for a while- I had to turn it off- there is one slow song, but its not very good- I feel the vocals here are not that good- This album is WAY too heavy, and \\"not proggy enough\\" - explains my husband.- He likes it however-
B000001ELL|3.0|The good points:<br /><br />(1)  Ace Frehley has some very strong music here.  Even his cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"2000 Man\\" has become his own song here.  His best track, though, is \\"Hard Times\\", a sadly overlooked autobiography of his time on the streets, with a strong hook and blazing guitar work.<br /><br />(2)  Paul Stanley's vocals.  The man has a strong voice, and he uses it well here.  The strangest one is the extreme falsetto on \\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\\".  Pick hit for me is probably the underrated \\"Magic Touch\\", where Paul's voice stretches up and down the scale but flows at this dance-ballad's pace.<br /><br />(3) Gene's guitar on \\"X-Ray Eyes\\".  (Yes, it's Gene, not Ace).  Dark, moody, and fits the song very well.<br /><br />(4)  Peter Criss's voice on \\"Dirty Livin'\\".  Peter has a good voice for this type of driving beat.<br /><br />(5)  \\"Save Your Love\\".  Written for Peter, by Ace, about Peter's divorce from Lydia, his first wife.  Possibly some of Ace's best work on this album.<br />Bad points:<br /><br />(1)  TOO MANY SYNTHS.  The keyboards drown out the guitars on a lot of the songs.  Take a lesson from early Queen, guys-- lose the synths.<br /><br />(2)  \\"It's easy\\" should not be a reason to write a song.  Paul found \\"I Was Made...\\" very easy to write, but he wasted his talent here.  His solo album was a TON better than some of his work here.<br /><br />(3) The \\"I'm Gene and I want to **** you\\" thing was played out with a lot of his earlier stuff, especially around 1978.<br /><br />Bottom line:  this album was marketed by the right band, to the wrong crowd, for the wrong reasons, and some of the best material on it went ignored.  You'll really like the pop stuff if you're 12 and haven't heard their better stuff.  Otherwise, they have much better albums than this one.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|first, my review is for others, like me, who've never had the chance to see the live musical itself.<br /><br /> Anyone who goes into this with a open mind that they will be watching A-a musical, meaning at least 3/4 of the film is singing, and B-a period piece/costume drama-then I think you will be entertained. As someone who loves costume dramas, romance, \\"tortured heroes\\" and musicals I, of course, loved it! The sets and costumes are exquisite, and the songs are wonderful.<br /><br />The film would be a bit slow going for those who either are thinking more of the old Phamtom movie are those who do not like musicals.<br /><br />4.5 stars!
B00006690G|4.0|Pure genius. Only problem is cursing, because kids love this cd, but other than that, cd's wonderful. WARNING----------------------EMINEM + SERIOUS RAP = BAD RAP. It's uptempo and cool. Look for a clean version
B00003CXCT|5.0|It's \\"Star Wars\\"! What else needs to be said. It's the classic movie we all love and imitate, but in a new, DVD edition that takes the experiance to a whole new level. If you are one of those poeple that don't like Star Wars, or simply look down your nose at Sci-Fi in general, then you can just look away.  <br />Anyone who already is a fan of the Star Wars trilogy, will love the clarity and sharpness of the long overdue DVD editions of these classic films. It's time to let go of the VHS coppies that we all have had for the last 20 years, and upgrade to the DVD which will last much longer and play better.  <br />All of the extras, interviews, and behind the scenes footage on the DVDs make this collection a must have for anyone who loves Star Wars and wishes there would be move after Ep. III. Even if you don't care about all the extra stuff on the DVD, the clarity and sharpness is reason enough to get the DVDs to replace the old VHS coppies I know you have.  <br />What else needs to be said, it's worth every penny and a must have.
B0007O38F8|1.0|terrible. i miss in da club. boo hoo. But really, 50 cent isn't a really good rapper. just get a collection album of the jackson 5 or something
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Bill Murray (Bob Harris) and Scarlett Johansen (Charlotte) are seperated by 25 years, but are both at the crossroads in their lives. With the setting in Tokyo, they meet as strangers and slowly explore each others problems, while formimg a special bond throughout the film.   Following these characters through Japan, they help each other out with their problems and become enamored with each other. The dialog and interactions of the cast, were well written and well scripted. It perfectly shows the characters wrestling with their problems, as they have a hard time adapting to being in Japan while trying to figure out how to get out of the rut in their lives.   It's very entertaining and works so well because Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen sell it so well. Without seeing the movie, it may not seem that the two of them would gel so well, but they do in a special way. By the end of the movie, you are totally sold on the story line, as well as the chemestry betwen the main characters.   It's a relaxing movie that allows you to sail away on the personal journies of the two main characters, feeling enlightned and satisfied at the end. This film was very well done, and should be appriciated as an example of the fact that you don't need a $100 Million dollar budget to make a great film.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I'd like to review the whole concept of this band. I chose to put my review here, because this record is the most horrible example of their muzak. Yes I can hear that you guys are great players and I know you have gratuaded from a music school. I think that won't explain why you still lack imagination (\\"omg, we have a problem. We need to add twenty-one minutes to this song. I can't come up with anything... hey Petrucci, why don't you masturbate with your guitar for ten minutes and the others will show their enormous technical skills for ten minutes, and then we have the chorus again?\\") and dynamics? Why have you to drop out the last 1/8 of every bar to make the 4/4 riff go in 7/8, so it would be progressive? Maybe the emotion-lacking and uninnovative noise is not the issue - but the lack of DYNAMICS. Listen to Camel's Echoes. Now that is the best song ever made. The best thing is that there are quiet parts which are really quiet and louder parts which are really louder. It keeps the tension and attention going on and doesn't just bore your ears and make the music sound like a pot of porridge. It seems you think that dynamics in music is just about using a clean sound with some chorus when you want to play a softer part and then switch it to a really huge and compressed distortion when you want to rock. And how have you never heard of nuances? When you repeat this extremely hard 11/8 riff, which is just a 12/8 riff Mike Portnoy came up with while taking the [&*!#] and finally you decided to drop this last eight off because it would otherwise sound like pop music and too commercial, yes, you repeat it let's say, like, ten times, every time with the same [%*!#]ing way and same [%*!#]ing volume, so it would be reaaally boring. Oh, I forgot, it's metal music! Well, metal with its all original rawness and loudness is suitable for shorter songs, 3-4 minutes - longer ones need some kind of quieter passages and stuff borrowed from other styles or the listener would just be exhausted. LISTENING TO DREAM THEATER OR OVERLONG METAL MUSIC IN GENERAL IS JUST LIKE READING A VERY LONG TEXT IN ONLY CAPITAL LETTERS AND WITHOUT ANY PUNCTUATIONS YOUR BRAIN DOESN'T REALLY GET THE IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON AND YOU CAN'T FOLLOW THE TEXT INTENSELY FOR A LONG TIME WELL THIS IS NOT JUST WITH THIS KIND OF MUSIC IT IS A TREND WHEN MASTERING A CD TO OVERCOMPRESS THE MUSIC TOO [%*!#]ING LOUD SO IT CAN BE AS LOUD AS OR LOUDER THAN THE OTHER SONGS COMING FROM THE RADIO SO PEOPLE WOULD REMEMBER THEIR SONGS BETTER BUT WITH DREAM THEATER I THINK THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE, THEY COULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT WAY
0380789019|5.0|I don't know the words to say how i loved this book.... BUY THIS BOOK NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Unlike the previous reviews, this one is short, sweet and to the point. For me, this CD is Ryan's best since Heartbreaker and that's because I love his alt-country side and here that side is at its best. Ryan seems to have channeled the spirit of Roy Orbison and combined it with a whisp of the Dead to create a great mix of tunes that get better with every listen. Forget about who he is, the bad boy image and all the unimportant stuff and concentrate on the great music that this prolific artist delivers on Cold Roses. WOW, THIS CD IS AMAZING!!!
B000929AJQ|4.0|I'm on my 2nd listen, I got a little beer buzz, and I'm really appreciating more than I thought.  The main thing I want to get across is, yes Downward Spiral is my idea of the best and Fragile a great follow-up.  But what do you do after that?  You've gone down the hole as far as you possibly can, without being totally abstract or minimally ambient musically.  There has to be a change.  What do you do?  Go back to anger at least?  Ok...and so...what didn't occur to me. <br />As a band.  Yeah, it's song oriented. Not concept like DS and Fragile.  A little pop, disco part here and there.  And while lyrics can be cliche, compared to all the crap out there, still important questions and ideas to be reminded of. <br />Good songs, good production.  Like right now \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" as Trent questions \\"What if\\" as the crowd comes in, and the production comes up to you with those questions, it makes an impact. <br />My favorites are Every Day Is Exactly The Same, Love Is Not Enough, Only, Getting Smaller and Sunspots. <br /> <br />But the most important thing to get from this review is that <br />it's more band oriented, and it will grow on you more the less you have expectations of what you hope or think you should get from it. <br /> <br />Still worth buying. <br /> <br />I'm not a die hard fan, but a mediocre fan since back in the day.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I have been a long time Led Zeppelin/Plant/Page fan.  I have always enjoyed the manner in which both Zeppelin and Plant found the capacity to experiment and create new sounds.  That said, I really feel that Plant's latest effort is possibly his best work in his long and distinguished career.  I have not been able to stop listening to this CD.  Until now I thought Fate of Nations was his best solo work.  This album adds a few extra spices that Nations does not have.  Plant's voice is better than ever.  All The Kings Horses is such a beautiful song that it could replace Going to California in the live set list.  My personal favorite is The Enchanter which is hauntingly heavy.  The guitar work on the album is quite unique which plays so nicely along Plant's voice.  His lyrics are  spiritual and the production of the album is so crisp, while at the same time leaving room for the right amount of edge.  This album demonstrates that there is only one Robert Plant, and while his vocal work is constantly evolving--he is timeless.
B00009PJN4|5.0|This is one of the best \\"blind\\" CD purchases I've ever made.  I had never heard a single song by Aphrodite's Child but figured that since I'm a huge admirer of Vangelis (he wrote most of the music for AC) and Greek music in general that I'd give it a try.  Wow...I'm shocked at how wonderful this compilation is.  Not just a few hit tracks with filler but almost every song is catchy and memorable.  Highly recommended for lovers of prog-rock, 60's/70's, psychedelic rock and Vangelis!
0671027387|4.0|My first foray with Mr. Brown was with the \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" which was a wonderful page-turner. Same with \\"Deception Point,\\" a fascinating page-turner as well. I loved the science and the fast-paced plot of this one as well as \\"Angels and Demons,\\" and \\"Code.\\" What bothered me most about \\"Deception\\" and \\"Angels\\" were the many escapes from death in the absolute nick of time. They are all based on the characters' knowledge of certain scientific principles, which, although intriguing, were nevertheless far-fetched.  Nonetheless, I recommend \\"Deception Point\\" for its entertainment value, as I do the others. You also will learn some interesting science and/or history.
B000001FTD|5.0|This made me an Anthrax fan, twenty-whatever years ago or so. Heard it thousands of times over the years. It should be in the library of any Neo-metal fan today. <br /> <br />That is all. Just get it. Classic Anthrax at their best. I say its their best because I came in after Spreading The Disease, so ATL has special signifigance for me.

630521610X|5.0|\\"Scream\\", released in 1996, is a great horror film that stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox (now Cox-Arquette), David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Drew Berrymore, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, and others.  This film pays homage to many horror film classics that many horror film fanatics never forget.  Two sequels proceed.  Its release started a new frenzy of horror film fans.  It encouraged its audiences to watch the classics that influenced this film.  This later became Wes Craven's highest grossing film to date.  It received critical acclaim, including a consideration for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay (which was overlooked).      \\"Scream\\" desplicts a group of people in a town that is terrorized by a \\"serial killer\\" whose obsession with horror films goes too far.  He, she, or they call the intended victim, alters their voice through a machine, flirts with them, threatens them, and attacks them.  The police force's only lead to the killer's identity is a ghost mask.  Sidney Prescott (Campbell) seems to be the main target to this killer.  Does it connect to the brutal slaying of her mother a year before?  Does the killer want revenge, or does the killer want to play copycat?  Until the questions are answered, everybody is a suspect.  And those who break any of the horror film rules become a target.    Director Wes Craven certainly knows the true meaning of horror as he combines these films into this film, yet, fitting wonderfully.  He doesn't spoof any of them.  Rather, he creates his own horror film that is truly chilling.  He occassionally includes non-horror projects that fit the film well, including \\"The Ricki Lake Show\\".  Meanwhile, he adds the occassional teen humor that relates well to that age group.  Despite branching off other horror films, his creativity is expressed greatly as in his past films.  He takes the typical horror film traditions, mixes them, and makes them his own.  He makes every chase scene a roller coaster ride, every suspicious scene suspenseful, and every bloody violent scene intense.    Horror film commemorations include \\"Friday, the 13th\\", \\"Halloween\\", \\"Carrie\\", \\"The Exorcist\\", and his own \\"Nightmare On Elm Street\\".  Wes Craven plays a cameo as the janitor \\"dressed as\\" Freddy Krueger.  Through these various homage scenes, the main storyline of people being stalked by the killer is never distracted.  Meanwhile, he gives this film its own legacy beyond the now-infamous ghost mask.  While many other previous blockbuster films have tried paying homage to other films like it, this is the first that has succeeded in high quality.    Through this storyline, the actors finely express the crutial points of the film that make it more entertaining.  They scream wonderfully, they express their terror wonderfully, and they offer their own sense of humor through the perfect scenes.  Campbell expresses the terrorizing theme the highest while stretching Jamie Lee Curtis's legacy as Laurie Strode from \\"Halloween\\".  Cox and Arquette offer the sense of humor the most as an annoying news reporter and a police officer.  The actor or actors who play the killer or the killers offer their terrorizing moments greatly that make their character or characters more chilling.    \\"Scream\\" begins an unforgattable fine trilogy that will hold its position in film history for a long time.  Those interested in this trilogy must watch this edition first.  Otherwise, they will not understand the storyline.  This will surely continue pleasing its audiences as it has since its release.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Why did you mess up these movies? I loved these movies, so I   couln't wait to buy the dvd trilogy. Now I can't wait to get  rid of them, THEY'RE USELESS! When something works, you don't  change it! I see alot of other reviewers agree with me, that  should tell you something!  You owe me $47.00, Genius!
B000067J1H|5.0|this movie was a great movie, it has it's moments of mindless violence, but come on, doesn't everthing today? this is the closest thing you will get to having a truely good movie today. jack, you long for a time that passed a while ago man, wake up and smell the violence. wake up and smell fight club.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|It is very difficult for me to give this album less than four stars, but I know that deep down, the album as a whole just doesn't \\"do it\\" for me. I am the farthest thing from a metalhead that you can find. I listen to Shostakovich. Therefore I am a HUGE Yes fan, and I love all of the other classic Prog rock bands; Genesis, Pink Floyd, ELP, Supertramp etc. I had heard great things about Dream Theater, that they were the best Prog Metal band there is, and also the best \\"third tier\\" prog band. This was the only DT album that my local music store had, so I bought it, after reading the awesome reviews on this website. I experienced reactions that were more mixed than all other reactions I have ever experienced. Commence track by track review now: \\"As I Am\\" - Not bad. The introduction is a great way to start an album. A shimmering keyboard chord evaporates into an awesome distorted guitar line, followed by loud and slow guitar chords. Then the main body of the song begins, and it speeds along fairly well. \\"This Dying Soul\\" - Ugggh! What a terrible song! There is no trace of prog in this number. Being a Shostakovich fan, I can't take more than one minute of this. It almost single handedly removed a star from my rating! \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" - I like the acoustic bits, and I hate everything else. \\"Honour thy Father\\" - This is very much like \\"TDS\\" to me, but not quite as bad. By now you may be thinking, \\"He hates this album, where did 3 stars come from?\\" Read on. \\"Vacant\\" - A nice (if short) ballad of desperation, in which a man loses a loved one. Probably a daughter, judging by the corresponding photograph in the Storm Thergousten (sp?) booklet. This acts as a prologue to the emotions expressed in \\"Stream of Consciousness\\". \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" - WOW. This lengthyish instrumental is the high point of the album for me. So many musical ideas are packed together in one enormously technical and emotional song. I always have to move when I listen to this song. I usually do air keyboards, as this is my home instrument. Jordan Rudess's brief keyboard excursions make me cry. Great guitar and drums as well. \\"In the Name of God\\" - Another OK track. The longest on the album, and with the best lyrics. It talks about how people bend what the Bible says and exploit fanatics for their own gain. The Latin bit is really cool, and this track has some great acoustic guitar. Now. Why 1 1/2 stars? Because I just heard Images and Words. Every song on the album surpasses the first four tracks on this album, but none of it can come close to the last two. This is a good place to start if you want to get into DT, as it will let you know if you like the \\"Six Degrees\\" era, which I have heard is very heavy; or the \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" era, which is brilliant prog metal.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I would like to apologize to all of the people who saw a good review of this cd, went out and wasted 15 bucks on it, and then realized that it was the worst album EVER. In 2002, Avril released \\"Let Go\\". I thought nothing could be as horrible musically until I heard \\"Under My Skin\\". Avril hardly writes any of her music, then she sings it horribly with abysmal guitars, bass, and drums. She is a poser. She bashes Hilary Duff and Britney for being to artificial, then to show it she goes on trl and says shes punk. The first thing I thought when I saw a commercial for it was \\"wasn't Britney on a few days ago?\\" She is not hardcore by any means and is a disgrace to any musician or music listener. Also, I believe that people that are truly punk rockers HATE CORPORATIONS. Avril is a postergirl for everything artificial and bad. This is not real music.
0688163173|4.0|This book is kind of a mystery/horror story.  I read it a while ago but can't really remember the details.  This is basically about a guy (who is a FBI agent) who visits a nuthouse (on a maximum security island because these guys are dangerously nutty) to find the whereabouts an escaped patient.  While on the island he finds out about some very shocking practices of the staff at the island which draws him deeper into the case.  The book takes a few turns with a very shocking ending.  If you like happy endings this book is not for you.  This book (to me) kind of parallels the plot of the movie the Wickerman although this book takes the plot to a deeper level.  What's cool about this book though is how the ending can be interpreted in different ways depending how you analyzed the story.<br /><br />To me Lehane is the master of misdirection.  His endings always screws up your initial predictions based off the way he feeds information to you as the book progresses.

B00000ADG2|5.0|I remember this album when I was in the 6th grade. This album was and still in my CD rotation. This is a deeply personal album, running from the gamut from the affairs of the heart to socio-political issues, and set against a sonic backdrop displaying this woman's talent. This album is confrontational, strong, forthright, and intelligent, while retaining a delicate, sensitive balance. She dealts with subjects close to her heart. This album forays into hip-hop territory. Her delicious vocals engage and captivate. Musically, she brings a warmth and sensitivity to the sound of this recording. She also displays her knowledge of the work as a producer. This album is evidence of her self-assured attitude as a well-rounded artist and studio technician. This record is musical proof. This album has been certified 7x Platinum. Remember, this was 1998-1999.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sorry to burst the bubble of some previous blinkered reviewers but if you go to any rock related bb beatles fans come in all ages from 12 to the 60s generation. That's because they are mega hip and uber timeless.I recall when the anthology cds were released in the mid 90s the beatles were being promoted like some modern rock band such is their timelessnes. So much anger seems to be directed at the beatles,mainly because they are so highly rated and also because they eclipse many of the younger bands,which peeves off a few young fans I guess:) <br />Aside from that this is arguably the beatles peak along with revolver and abbey road.Timeless rock that will last through the ages like mozart. <br />Yes it is psychedelic,yes it is hippyish but that was the fashion back then,and besides weren't hippy ideals,ie peace,love etc all timeless ideals?  <br />Recommended for all ages!
B000088DTS|5.0|Delta Goodrem is a top Australian artist. Some of my Aussie friends introduced this singer to me and I was instantly amazed at her beautiful voice. This cd has some awsome piano backgrounds played by Miss Delta. She is talented and she has songs for everyone on her album. These songs are more mellow than those you'll find on her newer album Mistaken Identity, but they represent all that the earlier Delta stood for. This is a must have if you can find the import at a good price! You are guerenteed to love it, as many all over the world already do!!!
630542845X|5.0|I saw Powder at the theater when it first came out and I thought it was a great movie. It might have it's flaws, like any other movie, but it's still a great movie. Just because the writer-director Victor Salva was in prison for molesting a child actor, doesn't make him a bad writer-director. He might be a sick man, but he still made a great movie. If you've never seen this movie, don't let that stop you from watching it.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Ray Charles was a first-rate musician. He could make music! But this CD, in general, is not a joy to hear. First (through no fault of his own--he was very sick, after all), Charles' voice sounds very weak and strained here. One can still hear evidence of his outstanding talent, but it is very diminished. Second, most of the song selections were not well-advised. I love James Taylor, for example, but not that song, and certainly not in duet with Ray Charles. Similar comment can be made about many of the other songs and singers. Two or three of the tracks are excellent, however, particularly Charles' respective duets with Bonnie Raitt, Van Morrison, and Johnny Mathis. In my opinion, those three tracks alone are worth the purchase price (while most of the others I probably will skip in future). Also (for you audiophiles), the recording-quality varies from track to track; sometimes it is very good, but mostly it is merely adequate. <br />
B0001BS4Q0|5.0|This CD is definitely a progression from Sia's first album, mostly powered by the singles 'Numb', and 'Breathe Me' (now airing on the new Six Feet Under ad).  There is an emotional resonance in Sia's music that is lacking in almost all pop music these days.  Her soulfulness doesn't rech the point of being annoying that Tlpopmusik sometimes does, and her collaborations on Zero 7's first two albums were the high points of those releases, although the first was much more inspiring than the second.  All in all, I would say she is a talent on the horizon, not yet reaching her full potential.  Keep an eye out, trust me.

B0007TKNIS|5.0|This was a brilliant version of Phantom of the Opera. I have never seen the actual stage presentation of the musical, so this was a treat to watch in on the big screen. Like many of the other reviewers, I felt like this adaptation of the musical pulls off the big screen feel that this work should have.  <br /> <br />Another reason this version thrives is that the movie did not diminish or impede LeRoux's original novel. This could have been another lame attempt by Hollywood to take a story from a novel and \\"dumb\\" it down, adding unnecessary plot details and overdone scenes. Thankfully that didn't happen, and the gothic/ horror feel is depicted successfully.  <br /> <br />The singing is superb and I felt like the movie was well cast. Emmy Rossum exerts a successful job as Christine Daae and Gerard Butler does as well also as the Phantom. With the way the film is produced and directed, it is not hard to \\"get into\\" the head of specific characters.  <br /> <br />Sometimes it is the small aspects that make movies a grade better than the rest. The way the producers used the black and white screen to flash ahead to another time at the movie's outset, and then periodically go back to this, was uniquely satisfying, and helps the story along. It also made the transitions back into LeRoux's story even more effective. Also, the cinematography and visual effects aid in exemplifying the essential themes of the story: love, hate, jealousy, inner beauty, despair, isolation, hope. These all come forth in the grand chandelier scene, the cemetery scene with Christine, the isolation of the Phantom in his chambers, and the magnificent opera scenes.  <br /> <br />Finally, there is a successful transition from Broadway musical to movie. This one does live up to the hype.  <br />

B0007TKNIS|5.0|I have seen many versions of The Phantom Of The Opera. I've seen the 1925 version with Lon Chaney, the one with Claude Rains, the 80's version with Robert Englund and the 1990 one with Charles Dance which is actually my all time favorite movie along with this 2004 Phantom film. I also own the Original Cast Recording CD and the Original Motion Picture soundtrack to this film. When I first heard about this movie coming out in December, I knew I would like it but I really didn't think I would totally fall in love with it like I have. I saw the film in the theatre over 30 times because I love it so much and it is so romantic and artistic that it was like they made the film just for me. Since I am this total hopeless romantic, this film is MY FILM!! I bought the 2 disc DVD the day it came out and have already watched everything and have seen some parts more than once. It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to movies because I don't need nudity and cursing or just a bunch of people getting drunk and stuff like that.<br /><br />What really impresses me about this film is the whole artistic and romantic setting. Like all the candlebras and roses and everything is covered in gold and even the stage curtain looks like real velvet. They use real animals in the shows and in The Phantom Of The Opera, there is a real horse. The actual theatre is covered with red velvet, gold and statues and the chandelier looks like it's made out of real diamonds and gold. And all the romantic things that both The Phantom/Gerard Butler and Raoul/Patrick Wilson do are just so breathtaking and powerful. Like when the Phantom is singing to her in The Music Of The Night, I can see so much passion between the two and he just takes and holds her hand and after she faints, he carries her to the bed and he doesn't even try to do anything sexual with her. He pulls down that curtain around the bed. I just totally love that. And Raoul sings his heart out to Christine up on the rooftop in All I Ask Of You about how much he loves her, he doesn't try to have sex with her. They share this very romantic, passionate kiss and every time I see the All I Ask Of You scene, I start to cry because it's so romantic and wish that could happen to me!  I wish I could find a man as romantic as they two are. The Phantom Of The Opera scene is so powerful that it totally takes my breath away!!  I love how they filmed Christine and The Phantom going down the stairs as Christine sings \\"The Phantom Of The Opera Is There, Inside My Mind.\\"  I also love the Masquerade ball, it's amazing musically, vocally, visually. I love how Christine and Raoul dance and then share this kiss!  My all time favorite scenes are The Phantom Of The Opera, The Music Of The Night, All I Ask Of You, Masquerade and The Overture. I watch those over and over again.<br /><br />All the other cast members are amazing also. Minnie Driver plays a really funny Carlotta, and Andre/Simon Callow and Firmin/Ciaran Hinds are funny whenever they talk about scrap metal. I always laugh when they say scrap metal.<br /><br />As far as the music and singing goes, it's so incredible and musically, it's better than the Original Cast Recording because they had over a 100 piece orchestra which sounds so much better and fuller. The singing is definitely one big reason I also love this film. Emmy Rossum/Christine has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard and to be honest there are a lot of parts where Emmy does a better job than Sarah Brightman did. On The Point Of No Return/Don Juan, when Emmy sings \\"When will the flames at last consume us\\" she hits this really low register and it sounds so amazing and incredible. I also love it when Emmy sings really high in the very first part of the Don Juan opera. She also hits this really high note and holds it in that part right before All I Ask Of You starts. Emmy also shows her emotions through her singing unlike Sarah Brightman. At the very end when Christine is singing to the Phantom, \\"The tears I might have shed for your dark fate, grow cold, and turn to tears of hate\\" you can hear the hatred in Emmy's voice. Gerard Butler who plays The Phantom might not be as good as Michael Crawford but there are a few parts that I feel Gerard has done a better job.  Especially after Christine kisses him at the end, you can hear him crying and feel his heartache. They are all incredible but I listen to the Phantom soundtrack a lot just to hear Emmy's voice. This film is now my favorite along with the Charles Dance version.<br /><br />The special features on the 2nd disc were really cool because I found out so much information. The Behind the mask: The story of The Phantom Of The Opera actually shows footage from inside the real Paris Opera House and there really is an underground lake and saw some creature swimming around which looks really cool. They also show a lot of shots from the Broadway musical with Sarah Brightman. It shows Sarah singing in a church. I was amazed that they put in some info about past versions of the film and showed a picture from the 1990 version with Charles Dance who is my favorite actor of all time. The Making Of The Phantom Of The Opera is in 3 parts, Preproduction, The Director, and Production. In these 3 parts, you will see interviews with Andrew Lloyd Webber, Joel Schumacher, Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler, Patrick Wilson, Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson, Simon Callow, Kevin R McNally who plays Buquet, Jennifer Ellison who plays Meg, and many others including the lyricist Charles Hart. And these bonus features are over an hour each.<br /><br />The third feature, which I've seen a lot of reviews stating that it's The Phantom singing Learn To Be Lonely, it's NOT Learn To Be Lonely, it's No One Would Listen! It's the same melody but the lyrics are totally different! No One Would Listen is sung by the Phantom and is an additional scene not shown in the film and it's a very short scene and they should have included it in the film. There is also an Easter Egg that's a Sing A Long to The Phantom Of The Opera and shows Emmy twice and a lot of other Cast and Crew members singing and it's very funny!!! The last thing is a DVD-ROM PC Weblink extra also if you have a PC that will play it but unfortunately, my computer doesn't have a DVD-ROM but that's not a big deal because eventually I will get a PC with a DVD-ROM. I highly recommend this to all Phantom fans and romantics!!! You will not be disappointed!!!he Phantom, \\"The tears I might have shed for your dark fate, grow cold, and turn to tears of hate\\" you can hear the hatred in Emmy's voice.

B0007XT87G|5.0|I'll come right out and confess that I've been a PT fanatic for over 7 years now . . . I'm sure a lot of people don't even realize that this band has been together (i.e. Steve Wilson writing, playing, and singing) for quite some time already. <br /> <br />I have LOVED everything that PT has done, with their last album \\"In Abstentia\\" top of the top of the top. So when \\"Deadwing\\" was due to be released I awaited with mixed feelings -- I couldn't wait to hear it but there's always that worry that the album won't quite live up to the other ones. I mean, eventually this happens to everyone; not every album can top the previous. <br /> <br />So I got the album, listened to it a few times, and I had the same reaction that a lot of people had -- good, even quite good, but not spectacular. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Now, don't get me wrong, I genuinely loved it and I listened to it regularly but I didn't think it was a masterpiece . . . until one day, that is . . . . <br /> <br />One day I was giving it a spin, probably the 20th time I was playing it, and all of a sudden it sank in -- holy crapolie, this *IS* a masterpiece!!!  4 out of 5 stars, baloney! This is 5 out of 5 stars, even 6 out of 5 if Amazon would allow that. \\"Deadwing\\" is just as spectacular as any of the others . . . just as classic as \\"Stupid Dream,\\" just as passionate as \\"Lightbulb Sun,\\" and just as kick-ass rockin' as \\"In Abstentia.\\" It truly, truly IS a masterpiece and I cannot put it away.  <br /> <br />I ask all listeners to give this album a fair shot and to disregard both (A) the 3 or 4 out of 5 star reviews and (B) your own initial reaction if you find the album a bit tepid. Give it some time and like fine wine, this just gets better and better every time you hear it. <br /> <br />Yes, this ALBUM IS PURE BRILLIANCE!!
B0006MT314|5.0|this soundtrack is by far the best to accompany a tv show. all of the songs are GREAT, especially, \\"when the stars go blue\\" by tyler hilton and bethany joy lenz. referring to another review, this version is FAR better than the one originally released by ryan adams, and \\"the good kind\\" by the wreckers is also fantastic. everyone should own this cd even if you dont watch the show, there is tons of talent!
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah has been one of the most impressive and unbelievable artists within the past few decades. There's no question to it. Simply, \\"It's Like That\\". The vocalist who gained superstardom with the strength of her 5-Octave voice, I have seen a lack of quality in Mariah's music since 1999. What was the cause of this? I would bet that it was because of competition of other new mainstream artists such as Britney Spears who created sex appeal as one of their main strategy factors. Britney's music was all incorporated with sex appeal, which brought a new generation of teenaged pop singers. Some remained in the scene, and some faded away in an instant. This entire teen-pop generation intimidated Mariah's current record company who at the time was - Sony Columbia Records. Investigatively, they were forcing many of their artists to incorporate sex appeal and follow the manners of Britney Spears - who's methods actually WERE working at the time around the late 90's and early 2000's (The ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again era). Just look at the CD cover of \\"Daydream\\" (one of Mariah's best albums from 1995) and compare it to a more recent \\"Rainbow\\" (The cover depicts her in her underwear). Obviously, the sex appeal has been magnified to what it was before. Columbia seemed to have concentrated more on sex appeal and less on musical quality and artistry unfortunately... These failed attempts caused her to move to Virgin Records - causing an even bigger flop of 2001's \\"Glitter\\" and then moving to Island of Universal's UMG and releasing another failure - \\"Charmbracelet\\". Finally after her past 6 years of unfulfilled attempts, Mariah has returned with \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" which debuted at #1, certifying itself as gold within just 2 weeks. The start-off single \\"It's Like That\\" proves that \\"Mimi\\" can include both an R&B club beat and also demonstrate powerful vocal ability in one track. The follow-up single \\"We Belong Together\\" is a sugar-sweet ballad which showcases many of Mariah's powerful vocals and pushingly persuades the listener to comprehend how powerful of a vocalist Mariah really is -- something today's shallow music industry is obviously lacking. The next big stand-out is \\"Mine Again\\", a slower-tempo track really showcases how powerful Mariah's voice still retains at the mature age of 35. \\"Get Your Number\\" featuring Jermaine Dupri is a big club or upbeat standout track in the album -- though I find that it refers to far too many materialistic refences. For example, she pleads of having \\"A house in capri and my own G4 and the Benz with the doors that lift up from the floor\\" and unforgetably, \\"A pip penthouse with a sick hot-tub\\". These references obviously refer to how she is attempting to also be favorable to younger audiences as well as older A/C listeners. The last mentionnable tracks on this cut are \\"Circles\\" and \\"Joy Ride\\", once again demonstrating the powerful vocals which Mariah still retains - 15 years into her superstardom. Mariah's true success secret is how she now simultaneaously appeals to polytheistic audiences - with her R&B hooks loved by the younger \\"hip\\" teenagers and her more relaxed and powerful AC ballads favored by older adult audiences. Though Mariah's voice has finally returned and is very powerful, it is lacking something that it had in 1993's \\"Music Box\\" and 1995's \\"Daydream\\". But I've got to cut her some slack - She's 35 years old and no longer 20!  <br /> <br />Mariah's success and talent is simply a fact of life. It's simply \\"Like That\\".  <br />My days of waiting for another worthy Mariah album is over... <br />...Finally!
0689878451|5.0|This is a true story of two male penguins in the Central Park Zoo that decided that they were a couple.  They built a nest of rocks like all the other couples and sat on the rocks hoping for a chick like all the other penguins.  With a little help, they ended up with their own special family.  What a wonderful way to introduce children to the concept of different types of families!  The love they have for one another is so touching and natural.  It proves that these bonds form quite naturally and that the love shared is just as valid as in the traditional family.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers will remain one of the greatest World War II films ever made for years to come. As someone who has served eight years in an airborne unit and a veteran of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Joint Guardian (Kosovo), I can truly say this film captures combat on many levels. The level of detail in each episode raises the bar for future combat films to try and reach. From Normandy on D-Day to Hitler's Eagles Nest, this film follows Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment throughout it's WWII experience. The characters are true to life and offer an inside look at what American Paratroopers dealt with during the war. Special effects and outstanding cinematography contribute to making this film an awesome visual experience. After a dozen or more times watching this film, I can't get enough.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I am a very strong Christian and a very faithful Christian and know that Jesus loves me!!  It's not just a belief, it goes so much deeper than that, but a feeling and a knowing that Jesus loves me deep in my soul and that he is always with me and he will never forsake me!  I have been at some very low points in my life and I actually had a message sent to me from The Lord, a spiritual awakening, yes Jesus spoke to me and now I am such a stronger and better person and for eternity, I will walk with Jesus, The Heavenly Father and The Holy Spirit!  I love Jesus and when I even think about what he did for me, dying for me on the cross, words can't even say how bad I feel and I start to cry.<br /><br />I started to watch this film and I didn't even get to the part where Jesus is on the cross and I was just in so much pain from seeing my saviour getting hurt from all these people.  Even before the cross, Jesus was taking abuse and it was too painful for me to watch any more.  I do intend to watch the entire thing one day, maybe even with another Christian, or even a husband who would be a Christian.  I picture Jesus on the cross and I just feel so much pain and it's just so painful to watch my Savior being hurt.<br /><br />Jesus will be with me for eternity and I will be him for eternity and I will never turn my back on him again!  Whatever mistakes I made in my life which brought me to those low points, I now no longer make and I always ask myself this:  What would Jesus do?  I ask that question before making any kind of big or important decision in my life.  I pray every day for everyone and for all the people who don't have Jesus in their life, to be touched in some way by God and get a message because I want everyone to have eternal love, eternal peace, eternal joy and eternal happiness with Lord Jesus, The Heavenly Father and The Holy Spirit in heaven!!  Thanks be to God, The King Of Kings, The King Of Love, Jesus!!!  May everyone have a blessed day!!!
B00004YZFR|5.0|It would be dificult to make a film about such an intriguing event uninteresting, but it's even more difficult to display it with such intimacy, craft, and accuracy. From the first frame on, I was sold.  This is the stuff of legends; even 35 years later, you can feel the moment. The music, the people, the images; it's both heartbreaking and entertaining. Mick Jagger is almost speechless while watching the footage, but the emptiness of his face gives it all away. \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is captivating from every aspect. There's just so much going on here.  I was shocked to see the struggle to maintain a \\"hippy\\" vibe in the midst of the violence; the voices are so much softer and the music is so much louder than I would have expected. I can not recommend this enough. This is one of the best movies I've seen.
B0007GAERG|5.0|\\"We Belong Together\\" has already been pegged the \\"prom song\\" and the third single will be the club-banger Say Something feat. Snoop Dogg and trust me, when Mariah releases that song, WATCH OUT. The Emancipation is such a great album. Besides the fact that there are at least 8 hits songs on the record, her recent live performances have back up the claim \\"The Return of the Voice\\"...Make no mistake, NO OTHER FEMALE artist can write the songs and hit the notes Mariah hits effortlessly. Mariah is 15 years into her already record-breaking career and the new album has been in the top 2 on Billboard since its release. Mariah is an artist that still feels very new, and this album proves she will still have fun forever..
630542845X|5.0|Victor Salva's POWDER fuses science with religion perhaps even better than Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because it goes to the heart of what life may be all about - that every living thing is actually an indestructible bundle of living energy, a belief held by Albert Einstein.         As Jeff Goldblum's character in the movie eloquently says to Sean Patrick Flanery's, the movie's title character a/k/a Jeremy, this was also the basis for Einstein's belief in life after death.  Goldblum's monologue goes on to suggest that the almost perfect human - possibly represented by \\"Powder\\" (Jeremy) himself - would evolve through eons of love, understanding, and the 100% use of his or her brain (as opposed to the apparently less than 10% most of us are using now) to the point that he or she would no longer require the human body and would literally become the purest form of that human energy - as \\"Conversations with God\\" author Neale Donald Walsch might call it, a living flame finally prepared to interact lovingly with other living flames (not to mention God) without fear.         Goldblum further quotes Einstein later in the movie even more poignantly:  \\"It has become appallingly clear that our technology has surpassed our humanity.\\"  However, with its heartfelt direction by Victor Salva, superb acting by Goldblum, Flanery, Mary Steenburgen and Lance Henriksen, other-worldly photography by Jerry Zielinski, and J.S. Bach-level score by the late great Jerry Goldsmith, POWDER is proof positive that sometimes our humanity DOES surpass our technology, even in Hollywood.
B000929AJQ|4.0|This new NIN album is different from the other releases in that it has a heavy focus on live drumming!  There aren't as many machine-produced beats as there are real drumming.  There are still a few tracks that have the more electronic sound to balance out the album and give it that mysterious feel.  There are solid classics on this album, as well as intricate intense/heavy songs.    I can't see why you wouldn't like this album if you like NIN.  It's good (...).

As an award winning feature filmmaker I've done a ton of educational methods to be a better director/writer and I'm already feeling the gaps in my craft filling with some proper perspective. As my journey of knowlege/experience expands I will always count this work as a paramount aspect of guidence in deciding how the story should be told.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Really bad horror movie that has only the great performance of Rachel Weisz from keeping it from being a total waste of time. Keanu is miscast to the point of him hurting the film and the script is so horribly written that it literally almost too painful to the ears.    Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only good thing about the entire film.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|I am giving this album 5 stars because, although it has its flaws, I have never seen any cd blend electronics with rock and roll so well. Songs like \\"Television Rules the Nation\\" and \\"Human After All\\" sound like hard rock fused with catchy techno. I will admit, this cd is a bit repetitive, but it manages to make that work for it. It is extremely danceable, and the songs retain their catchiness all the way through. This entire cd is indeed \\"robot rock\\" <br /> <br />This cd is NOTHING like discovery, and most people seem to criticize for that reason. I think thats just stupid. Discovery was like robot pop, and thus it appealed to a lot of people who like pop. This cd, however, does not appeal to the masses. Daft Punk is doing something original and different on this cd. Many fans of discovery like the song \\"make love\\" just because it sounds more like something from discovery, and yet they criticize this cd for being repetitive. Well, make love is probably the MOST REPETITIVE song on this cd, which just goes to show that this cd isn't really too repetitive. Its juts not what everyone expected it to be. I think its good for a band to change, and that people should just let go of the past. I do not feel like this is the end of daft punk or that they failed their fans somehow. I simply think they have changed. <br /> <br />I love the raw power of this cd and its groovy house beats. I personally like it much more than discovery, because I never really liked the electronic pop stuff on it. I do however think that this cd could use a little more variety of sounds, and a little more variations of melody within most of the songs. Still, people should stop comparing this to discovery and look at the album for what it is. Its not perfect, but its not in any way worse than their other albums. Everytime a band goes in a different direction, lots of fans are bound to dissaprove. But change isn't always bad.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Someone please explain to me how this is prog music- to me it sounds to me like prog poop!! DO NOT BUY
B000929AJQ|4.0|I am a huge NIN fan. I like the complexity and imagery that Trent Reznor creates. When I listen to his previous albums, I sense something deeper and more powerful than your everyday rock. But this latest release just doesn't have that feel. If it were released by a brand new, no name band, it would probably get great reviews and win an award. But when you compare it to NIN other albums, it doesn't really stack up. I guess Trent Reznor is either trying to appeal to a larger, more pop fan base or he has run out of real inspiration. I still give it four stars, but it didn't blow my mind.
0790749815|5.0|On TV I swallowed this film already 19 times, in German. Afterwards, I saw it two times in an English Cinema. At last, I bought the English version and, up to now, I enjoyed this video 5 times. Every time I saw it I had to repeat the famous Auction Scene at least ten times. The mixture of excitement and Cary-Grant-humour and the excellent music make this film a big big event. I am looking forward to seeing it again next time.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Pretty Hate Machine was the only NIN CD I liked immediately.  Okay, I knew upon first hearing it that CLOSER was a classic, and I did warm up to Downward Spiral faster than, say, Broken, but I had to listen to The Fragile maybe six or seven times before it got me (then, of course, it was all I listened to for months).  My point is that NIN is not like any other rock group - you basically know what Aerosmith's next album is gonna sound like.  Ditto DMB.  But Trent makes music that makes sense to him at the time, regardless of what formula used to sell.  Pretend it's visual art: why do the same Campbell's soup painting every year for the rest of your life?  Even if it got you rich, what if you felt like sculpting something, even if it doesn't sell to the public?  Art is about fulfilling an artist's original ideas and conceptions, business is about making money.  (Think about that when you're standing in line at the next summer sequel.)  How do I judge With Teeth?  I was happy that \\"Deep\\" was more of a return to an earlier style, but loved his acoustic album \\"Still\\" and With Teeth is a nice amalgum of the two.  Are there flaws?  Yep.  An odd running order?  Yep.  Do a few songs seem to not fit?  Yeah - but remember, this was originally a project called \\"bleedthrough\\" that was to be a whole album of songs with no chords (think of ninety minutes of \\"WithTeeth,\\" and \\"Beside You In Time.....\\") and seemingly changed course at the very end - who knows if that record would have been the Pretty Hate Machine version of The Fragile?  It takes a few listens, but once you hit Every Day Is Exactly The Same, you've got a great album on your hands.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|For me this album represents a big decline in the quality of writing from Dream Theater. The songs although chock full of heavy riffs, unisons and time sig shifts seem to lack any direction and to my ears end up sounding like a collection of riffs. The lack of distinct clear melodic hooks is also very disapointing...I've always enjoyed Dream Theater above other prog/metal bands because of their ability to fuse interesting harmonic ideas, blistering technicality with soaring melodies but here, the melodic aspects are sadly missing. Technically the playing is immaculate as always, John Petrucci (Guitars) really goes for the throat on this disc (personally I prefer his more melodic playing). Everything is tight and accurate and the production is great - the bass is more audible than previous releases. If you like your prog on the heavier side of the spectrum theres lots to interest you here, otherwise you may be well advised to check out some of the bands earlier releases - \\"Images and Words\\" or \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance\\".
B0000CDLA7|1.0|This is another pedestrian album from a highly overrated band. Don't get me wrong: these guys have chops to kill, but good chops do not make great progressive rock. The biggest problem I have with this band is that all their songs sound alike - melodically clumsy and harmonically poor. There just is not enough original ideas, although there are occasional interesting instrumental passages. The vocalist just sucks, and overall they sound like a neo-prog band on steroids. THIS DYING SOUL- made me want to die after hearing it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005RY7X|5.0|Finally, Finally, Finally.   The party album of the century, that isn't hip hop.  Andrew WK rocks for over a half an hour through one of the most kick ass rock albums of all time.  People I know seem to have a problem with this guy, and those that don't think he's joking.  \\"Every song sounds the same, Wesley Willis was more diverse.\\"  Those are statements I hear after I throw on WK at the local tavern. Well their loss, because you AWK fans know what's up.  The only thing that's better then an AWK cd is a live performance, with blood on the piano and broken faces everywhere.  Standout track, She Is Beautiful.  $2.50!!!!!???  Buy it, stop being so judgemental, and have some fun.
B0006U4UAU|4.0|First things first; following the motions of many other reviewers here, LCD Soundsystem earns big bonus points for including a second disc of earlier singles to accompany this 2005 debut album.<br /><br />With that said, the new material is quality stuff in its own right. It's a mixed bag with some nice surprises, and its share of letdowns. \\"Daft Punk...\\" and \\"Great Release\\" aren't nearly half as good as they are made out to be. On the other hand, there are some supeb tracks on the first disc, most notably in my opinion, \\"Movement,\\" \\"Never As Tired...,\\" and \\"Disco Infiltrator.\\"<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure what genre to plunk LCD Soundsystem in with... I don't think there is really one appropriate genre actually. Some of the tracks sound like what is considered \\"house\\" music. I'm also unsure of what sounds something has to consist of to be granted that label, but I suppose this record partially fits the description. Then you have the track \\"Never As Tired,\\" which brings to mind for me, an experimental Syd Barrett flavour. Certainly not \\"house.\\"<br /><br />The first disc on its own merits a 3-star-rating, but the singles disc kicks it up a notch. The entire disc is excellent material, all of which is mind-bending. \\"Beat Connection\\" and \\"Give It Up\\" are on opposite ends of the spectrum, the former being very drawn out with building, acidic beats; the latter being an all out assault, but both fitting into the mix seamlessly.<br /><br />\\"Losing My Edge\\" is just an undeniably fantastic track. I am at a loss for words describing it... it just remains painfully good every time I listen to it. Both versions of \\"Yeah\\" could be the best pieces of music I've heard over the last five years. The Crass version reaches over nine minutes, and the Pretentious version almost stretches out to twelve. Yet they both hold your attention for the duration. \\"Yeah (Crass)\\" is definitely the more danceable version, and will be keeping heavy rotation among my current playlists.<br /><br />Overall, the spotty first disc prevents this album from being a classic. But between the worthwhile stuff found there, plus the duration of the second disc, LCD Soundsystem is well worth the price of admission./> <br />Overall, the spotty first disc prevents this album from being a classic.

B0002OERI0|5.0|This is one of those albums that I can play over and over again. Another one is Ben Folds Five \\"Forever and Ever Amen\\". Another is Pink Floyd \\"The Wall\\". Now, someone compared this album to Pink Floyd, but I don't see the connection. The only thing in common, that I find, is that they both are concept albums or rock operas. The styles are not very similar. Still, the lyrics are easily understood and the music is well recorded. Let's hear that one again....
B000068CNX|5.0|All of the other reviews do so much to fill in exactly what is on these discs for this season.  However there are so many other funny, funny moments that are included in these shows that i had to take a moment and fill in some of the rest of the things that are on these DVD's but not listed.  <br /> <br />Included in these episodes are:  <br /> <br />1. Chandler's having a \\"problem with touching\\" with Joey's tailor.  <br /> <br />2. Ross feeling jealous about the breast milk and pouring some on his arm and then being unable to do anything about it takes a towel and wipes it off and storms out.  <br /> <br />3. The funny scene from the baby on the bus where Chandler and Joey are deciding to flip for which baby to take home and Chandler says \\"what kind of scary *** clowns came to your birthday parties.  <br /> <br />4.  Ross and Julie on the phone saying \\"no you hang up, no you hang up\\" and Rachel, unable to take it anymore, grabs the phone from Ross and hangs up.  <br /> <br />I was rolling on the floor laughing watching these and although the descriptions for the shows give you a lot of insight into which show you are getting, the other precious, funny moments that are included in these episodes as subplots are just unreal.  Just thought I would share with you.   <br /> <br />This is a SUPERB season of Friends and you will LOVE it.  ENJOY!! <br />
B0000CDLA7|1.0|THIS SUX- buy scenes from a memory- it'll change your life- unlike this garbage
0375703764|4.0|This book will put you through 10 pages of pointless nothing (or maybe it is to set the mood) and then hit you with one page that will make you sleep with the lights on. I'm sure the other reviews have pointed out how unusual and sometimes anoying the writing style is, writing upside down and in mirror font and stuff.  It's all true, and the writer seemed to not really know where the heck the book was supposed to be going toward the end. But the basic storyline in this book is absolutely awsome, and the parts that are scary are probably the scariest I've ever read. Don't bother if you don't like wierd stuff though.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Granted, this \\"revenge of the nerds of the millennium\\" is NOT for everybody, but I'm certainly one of those who find it funny as hell, and a tad charming. <br /> <br />For one thing, it takes time to warm up to this film. A lot of really strange vignettes happen in the first half hour that really don't make a lot of sense (our man throwing a toy with a string on it out of a school bus window and watching it drag along the road, a farmer shooting a cow (offscreen, thank goodness) for no apparant reason, Napoleon and Pedro's female friend shyly attempting to sell Napoleon some junk, etc). Plus, the actors playing Napoleon and his best friend Pedro Sanchez look WAY too old to be in high school. <br /> <br />But after you sit through this with some patience, the \\"story\\" begins to hang together. Bascially, it's a really SWEET (as Napoleon would say) story of the bonds of friendship being established among social outcasts. Also, it's chock full of wild catch phrases (such as the title of this review) with deadpan delivery that you can't help but shout out at repeated viewings. <br /> <br />Of course, there are bound to be ultrasensitive over PC need-to-get-a-life types who will criticize this movie for some ethnic stereotyping. Here I refer to Pedro Sanchez himself and his admittedly hackneyed Mexican-American accent, Pedro's lowriding (apparently) gangbanging cousins, and LaFawnda, the Detroit ghetto queen who Napoleon's brother falls in love with over the internet. As an African-American myself, I would have to say that this is not \\"Soul Plane\\" or the \\"Frito Bandito.\\" These characters are likeable people who, beneath the superficial cultural differences, anybody could relate to. Plus, LaFawnda (unlike the overtly ghetto fabulous/slum pitiful sisters of UPN and BET) has a touch of class about herself and a good heart (in her advice to Napoleon in particular). As for Pedro, he's a fish out of water that is also a very sympathetic character. <br /> <br />But overall, anyone who has ever felt like they've been on the outside of humanity looking in (and who hasn't felt that way from time to time?) could realte to at least something this film, so see it. There's a reason why so many people are wearing all those \\"Vote For Pedro\\" t-shirts. After all, you too could drink whole milk if you wanted to! (see the movie and you'll get that last line).
1400032717|3.0|A decent plot made only above average by the fact it is narrated by an autistic boy. It is a good portrayal of an autistic person, really showing the world some autistic people live in. However, a person shouldn't read this book thinking that all autistic people are like this. <br /> <br />Christopher is a fifteen year old boy who lives with his father. He goes to a special school with other special needs people, but he doesn't see himself as special needs. Rather, that he is just like everyone else - different. His teacher suggests he writes a book, so he writes about what he knows, because anything else would be a lie. He writes about the mystery of the death of a neighbor's dog and his detective game. <br /> <br />That is only the first third of the book. It goes deeper than that. I liked this book, but I didn't love it. It didn't live up to the hype at all and I doubt it would have gotten as much attention that it did if the angle wasn't so different. The chapters that defer from the actual plot are boring and there are way to many of them. A good book, but not something I would reach for again, not for a long time. <br />
1400032717|2.0|For many, this book may be the only encounter they have with autistic children.  Please do not think that Haddon painted a true autistic character.  His research and understanding is lacking.  Good book, but the main character does not represent most autistics.
0140277447|5.0|This book is a great depiction of the events and the cruel treatment of the Chinese during WWII.  <br /> <br />For all of you people that say that this book is nothing but propaganda, and speaks nothing of the truth I got a few things to say to you. <br /> <br />1.) Of course people that are in Japan would deny such things. If your country was soley responsible for one of the most horrible events in history, would you admit to it? The only reason that Germandy admits to the Holocaust is because there is undeniable evidence that it happened. <br /> <br />2.) For whoever it was that said that this was only an attempt to make the Chinese look like the greatest victims of all time, I have this to say. If a Jewish man wrote a book about the Holocaust would you say to them that they were only tring to make Jews look like the ultimate victims? I don't think so. <br /> <br />3.) Not all historians are right, and some text books contain false information. I'm sure textbooks didn't contain chapters about slavery for awhile after the Civil War. Plus, we can't be definatly sure about any information. If you are interviewing someone who clamed to be in Nanking during the Japanese invation, you can't really be sure if they were really in Nanking or not. It did happen 60 years ago. <br /> <br />All in all a good book, I just had to get that off my chest. Those sceptics were annoying me.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Awesome album, although my friend doesn't think so, but what does he know. All the songs here are good. Overall, their best album at least to me. Period
B000003TA4|1.0|I have never seen such a display of vulgar Liberal Jiberal entertainment. They think that they are so tough with their long hair and instruments that make noise. This band is a Liberal wacko band, and they need to stop with all of this nonsense hoopla joopa in this day and age. <br /> <br />Two hippies were walking by me and they were talking about the band. I told them tha they should not listen to it because it rots their brains with total garbage Liberal weirdo stuff. <br /> <br />DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!! <br /> <br />GO REPUBLICAN!!!!
B0002F6BRE|1.0|A 35 year old man acting like a child....not funny..I could not go through first 30 mins..
B0009KA7BS|3.0|Perhaps the scathing reviews this movie is getting are due to high expectiations being disappointed, but, going in with no expectations, I actually enjoyed it. The plot is, admittedly, deeply flawed...in fact the entire idea of the cross-eyed Mexican finding the Spear of Destiny, the priest's death in the convenience store and the angel Gabriel's betrayal were useless and pointless. However, the script, while not particularly inspiring, was often funny. I thought that Keanu Reeves, Shia LaBeouf, and Rachel Weisz all did reasonably good jobs (I have to admit though, I didn't see anything spectacular about Weisz's performance, as so many others seemed to...) and Peter Stormare as the devil was well cast and well played. Constantine certainly wasn't a masterpiece, in any way, but I found it a funny, interesting film.
B000002WYT|5.0|This album is great from start to finish. Probably their best. Under the Table and Dreaming is also great. A lot of great songs here. PERIOD
B000002LK1|5.0|When Violator was released it was the first album to spurn a hit single in the US since 1984's some great reward. Violator is their most dance friendly album and 5 out of the 9 tracks are suited for the dance floor. Enjoy the silence, Policy of Truth, World in My Eyes and Personal Jesus were all major hits all over the world. Halo is another track that is awesome and in my opinion it should have been another single release. The lyrics are awesome and the sound, vocals, and beat are all stupendous and when you mix this together you have one heck of an album. This should have been Wilders last album with the band since SOFAD has an uninspired and tired Wilder dragging down the quality of the tracks and his studio work is not even close to the brilliance that he shows on albums such as this and music for the masses.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is one amazing masterpiece. But I do have a question that needs to be answered. I do not own this cd yet but i want to know what the song is called when in the movie elizabeth is on the pearl when all the pirates are in skeleton form? If you could email me and tell me what it is i would be very grateful. <br />My email is mvr24@hotail.com
B000056K04|4.0|A lot of great songs here also. Not their best but still a good effort.
B000002KZA|5.0|This is Depeche Modes most political album and it has definite leftist twist and one could call it their manifesto. Songs like Pipeline, everyhting counts, two minute warning and many others attack greed, capitalism and self serving ceos. One has to admire their convictions and the lyrics are not heavily laden with rhetoric like proleterianism or angry leftist manifesto speeches but lyrics that speak to the heart. Everything Counts is the strongest track on the album and truly a track that just gets better and better with time like a bottle of vintage wine. Martin Gore does most of the studio work and Allan has some influence and that is all good. This is a very political yet astounding album from one of the best bands ever.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I saw this movie while I was in Iraq during OIF2.  I saw it about the time of the initial move on Fallujah, my self as well as my other Marine friends watched in horror as this person just tore into America.   <br /> <br />Who is this guy?   <br />What is his purpose in life?   <br /> <br />I couldn't even watch the whole movie I was absolutely disgusted my friends attempted to make it further than I did and only lasted about another twenty minutes. I'll admit there are people out there who believe this movie to be informative.  I don't know why. <br /> <br />I can't say for sure why the things happened the way they did, but the people in Iraq needed us to take Saddam away from them.  I was there twice for fourteen months and both times I received thanks from the Iraqis for helping them get rid of a tyrannical pest.   <br /> <br />Let's say for a minute that we did go there for oil.  You drove to work today didn't you?  How much was gas?   A little more than usual.  Well the Iraqi's weren't using it, they were to busy being starved, murdered and raped by their leader.   <br /> <br />The only time I've seen justice doen with Michael Moore was in Team America when they blew him up.   <br /> <br />thank you Tray and Matt <br /> <br />U.S Marine
B000021XR5|3.0|I was very disappointed in this when it came out. Compared to the last three albums, this was a disappointment. There are some good songs on here, but overall the album is a dud.
B000002L9M|5.0|1986 is a year that many Depeche Mode fans consider as their best and the year that they left the soft sound of earlier records. I do not totally agree but I agree in the sense that it was a very important release and that it did cement the working relationship of Wilders studio work and Gores lyrics. The sound of the album is much more foreboding and grim then one previous albums and the lyrics have a twisted edge to them in songs like It doesn't matter too and Stripped. This was also the first album where Gore started experimenting with dressing in womens clothes, which caused som chagrin and internal dissent. A question of time, A question of lust, Black Celebration and Stripped all were awesome single tracks and further proved to the world that Depeche Mode was not a one trick pony but a band to be admired and not dismissed as merely a synth pop \\"outfit\\".
0783107986|5.0|This series tells the story of World War II primarily from a British perspective, but the story it tells is powerful and compelling.  The musical score, the graphics, the interviews and the narration from Sir Lawrence Olivier combine to make this one of the finest documentaries ever made.  Looking back with great appreciation to the producers of this documentary getting first hand interviews with such people as Doenitz, Kleist, and other nazis as well as telling the story of civilians who suffered such tremendous losses and went through such incomparable hardships.<br /><br />War footage from the Soviet Union and obtaining interviews during the cold war with Russian survivors of the war is a remarkable accomplishment that leaves their account available and accessible for future generations to understand the conflict and how it shaped the modern world.
B000002LCI|5.0|1986 and 1987 Depeche Mode released two albums, i.e., Black Celebration and this one, Music for the Masses. Music for the Masses is an amazing studio production piece and it shows Alan Wilder at his creative peak with songs like Strange Love, Behind the wheel, Never let me down again to mention a few. Pimpf is also a great experimental track and it shows Depeche Mode's best experimental effort in the studio so far.
B0006GAI6Y|1.0|The Japanese version of this movie falls into the comedic category of a \\"Manners Comedy.\\" In a Manners Comedy, the characters are so super-concerned with what other people will think about them that they do crazy things to avoid being \\"found out.\\" This is set up beautifully in the opening narrative of the original, where the narrator makes the statements about Japanese culture and reserve, how couples will not show affection in public, and that to be caught actually enbracing a stranger in public would be \\"beyond embarassing.\\" <br /> <br />The script of the original has a beautiful balance of characters who are \\"safe\\" and characters who are \\"dangerous.\\" The charming older lady teacher is \\"safe\\" and the lead character naturally gravitates to her. The overweight and unfiltered \\"fat lady dancer\\" character is \\"dangerous\\" and leads, at all points in the movie, to embarrassment. Yet in the end, she too is a supportive friend and there is a wonderful mutual acceptance among ALL the characters. This is part of the charm of the movie - the notion that in the end, dancing promotes civilized, harmonious interaction. The characters are ALL exposed in the end, and that creates a caring and a bond between them. <br /> <br />The original is a very sweet, beautiful little movie. <br /> <br />Now to this movie: <br /> <br />1. Richard Gere should never have been cast. It is simply  impossible to accept him as a man who feel overwhelmingly trapped in his mundane life.  <br /> <br />2. Jennifer Lopez should never have been cast. She doesn't have the substance required for the role. For one thing, she is a terrible dancer. For another, she lacks the polish of someone who has been trained to compete at the world level in such a \\"sophisticated\\" endeavor. The role requires someone like Audrey Hepburn or Ingrid Bergman. Instead we get \\"barfly\\" <br /> <br />3. All the fundamental conflicts and goals that drive the plot  in the movie are missing in this version. In the original movie, the main character's melancholy was brought on by a recent home purchase. There is a vitally important scene in the original movie that was left out of the remake. In the original, the Stanley Tucci character has a conversation with the Richard Gere character in which he praises the latter for being \\"a big success - you're moving up.\\" In response, the Richarad Gere character says \\"I had to mortgage my life to the firm to pay for it.\\" This is a fantastically critical line because it tells the audience, as early as possible, what the main character's conflict is - he feels TRAPPED. He worked all his life to buy this house and now that he has it, it feels like a ball and chain. In the same scene, the Stanley Tucci character is ridiculed by his co-workers. He too feels trapped in a life that is not right for him, too. Yet because of Japanese reserve and manners and traditions, both feel guilty - they must \\"do their duty\\" and live their lives as others tell them life should be lived. <br /> <br />In America, the fundamental conflict that drives the whole movie really doesn't translate very well, does it? In America we all can already do pretty much anything we want. To translate the plot to Chicago would require subtlety and intelligence. This director is apparently devoid of either. <br /> <br />In the Japanese version, the wife character is TOTALLY dependent on her husband. This is important. In the American version, the wife character seems completely independent. If she loses Richard Gere, it's not life or death - she gets a very healthy alimony and immediately moves on to someone else. In Japan, divorced women cannot so easily remarry. The stakes for the wife are much higher in that movie. And since it is a Manners Comedy, she is too embarrassed to confront her husband directly. Instead, she hires a private detective. This makes no sense in the American version. <br /> <br />4. A fundamental question of the original movie is, \\"is the relationship between the lead and thedancer adulterous?\\" What drives the Richard Gere character to the J-Lo character? How can we forgive him for doing it? <br /> <br />In the original, we know the lead character is TRAPPED. (\\"mortgaged his life to the firm\\"). He explains to the    Stanley Tucci character that he got married and had a child    almost before he knew what he was doing. He feels he SHOULD be happy - he has accomplished all of his goals - yet something    is missing. And he doesn't know what it is. <br /> <br />When he sees the beautiful young woman looking out the window,  he doesn't just say to himself \\"hubba hubba! what a dish\\" and    resolve to bed her. Instead, he is drawn to her because she    appears to be \\"trapped\\" too. She is like a beautiful bird in    a cage, looking out at the world. She wants to fly away. He    can sense this. He wonders why - she is so beautiful, how can    she not be happy? Why is she like me? Why is it that we both    have everything society tells us we need to be happy, yet we    are not happy?  <br /> <br />In the original, you can get the gist of this because of the    way the plot is set-up, and because of the excellent use of    the camera, and because of the natural grace, dignity, charm    and elegance of the actress. In this remake, it is completely    absent. You just see this curvy bimbo looking out the window from a distance.  <br /> <br />In the remake, there is no way for the audience to appreciate the lead character's feelings of relationship, and connection. So when he pursues her, it doesn't really make any sense. <br /> <br />I could go on and on about why this movie is vastly inferior to the original. Instead, let me just say that I could only bear watching this monstrosity for about twenty minutes. It is so hideous and unintelligent compared to the original, it is REMARKABLE!  How could this director ever have been given the money to butcher the movie in this way? He obviously didn't have the slightest understanding of the original, how it was put together and what made it work. <br /> <br />It is an example of Hollywood at its worst. Stupid people with lots of money who have no ability to analyze plots. Instead they just sign a couple of big stars and hope for the best. <br /> <br />Hanging would be too good.
B000002LGW|5.0|101 is grand live album and showed both fans and detractors that Depeche Mode had come a long way since their first concerts back in England. 101 was there 101st concert and it is a dandy of a show. Songs like master and servant, strange love and many others sound simply amazing and it proves that electronic music is not simply pressing some keys on a synth and that it requires real muisicans and trained vocalists. Dave Gahan sounds absolutely astounding on tracks such as Master and Servant and Everything Counts and Martin is no slouch himself. This is such a good live album and I will reccomend to anyone that likes good live music and for fans of Depeche Mode.
B0000AOV85|5.0|This look at Pink Floyd's \\"The Dark Side of Moon\\" is a template for the entire Classic Albums series in terms of providing insights and not simply telling stories out of school.  On the one hand we have Roger Waters sitting with an acoustic guitar explaining and playing songs, and on the other there is engineer Alan Parson sitting in front of the mixing board not only explaining but also showing how they came up with some of the most memorable bits of this album.  In between (in more ways than one) is Dave Gilmour, who brings out a series of guitars to recreate bits and pieces of the songs and then puts on his glasses to play around with the mixing board himself, letting us here the layered guitars.  Never has a look at \\"how they did it\\" for a record album been more fascinating.  Nick Mason and Richard Wright are interviewed as well, so everybody gets their turn to talk about the legendary album that was on the Billboard charts for almost fourteen years.<br /><br />Waters wrote a series of songs that had as their subject matter the rather mundane aspects of life.  The result was that Pink Floyd was directed toward making a concept album and if there is a key revelation in this documentary it is that these songs were essentially constructed before they were mixed.  That is pretty amazing when you get the examples of the soundscapes and various effects that created some of the most richly textured music of that period (I wanted to ascribe a particular genre to the album but there is everything from psychadelia and art rock to jazz fusion and blues-rock on this album).  The documentary goes into detail track by track on the album, but obviously some songs will stand out more than others (e.g., \\"Money,\\" \\"Time\\").<br /><br />The deleted scenes are pretty substantial on this DVD and give you more of the same.  The end result is a sense of wonder at how every thing fell into place for the band to perfect the album.  My favorite story is about Parsons bringing in Claire Torry, an EMI staff songwriter and session vocalist, to do the wailing wordless vocals at the climax of \\"The Great Gig in the Sky.\\"  But there are also nice stories about saxophonist Dick Parry and the guys who did the voices.  Waters, Gilmour and Wright all play some of the songs on acoustic guitar, which gets contrasted with not only the finished tracks but also demo tapes.  There is also footage from the old days to remember that these old men were once rock stars who put together one of the great concept albums of the rock era.  The disharmony that would eventually rip Pink Floyd asunder is only hinted at when the conflicting visions of how \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" should be mixed and does nothing to take away from enjoying this look at the classic album, which, of course, you will want to listen to again a couple of times after you watch this documentary.re Torry, an EMI staff songwriter and session vocalist, to do the wailing wordless vocals at the climax of \\"The Great Gig in the Sky.\\"   But there are also nice stories about saxophonist Dick Parry and the guys who did the voices.

B000002L75|5.0|To call Some Great Reward synth pop is unfair since that means that it is ligt sounding and has lyrics that basically talk about nothing. Some Great Reward is an amazing mid 80's release and has tracks People are People, Master and Servant that all shot up to the top of charts all over the world. This album also has strong non single tracks like lie to me and something to do. They are much more experimental then their critics ever give them credit for and the sounds used on Some Great Reward and Construction Times Again are not even remotely the same. The lyrics are not as trite as many critics have accused the for being and I consider it to be one of the best albums released that year.
B0006284JQ|5.0|Okay, let me start out by saying, that everybody on here who keeps hating on Britney and saying she's a whore are NOT helping anybody out on deciding whether or not to by this cd. U all are RETARDED.<br /><br />Now, let's being this review. Although Britney Spears is relatively new to the business, 5 years and going strong, when you read the track listing for this album, you realize how far and apparent she has been over the years. There are 17 tracks on this disc, spanning her first hit \\"...Baby, One More Time\\" all the way to her massive video hit \\"Do Somethin\\". This doesn't even include the bonus cd with 5 remixes.<br /><br />Although this collection doesn't do justice to the ARTIST Britney Spears, it does provide an album for the casual listener. It has all of the songs people who frequent the radio waves would want to have. So even if you hate Britney, as a lot of people do, you have to like at least one of her songs. It's just nuts not to. My personal favorite off of the album is probably the Darkchild remix of \\"Overprotected\\". And even for listeners who have all of her albums, this album has the appeal of unreleased or rare tracks. Such as the Overprotected remix, Do Somethin', My Prerogative, (I've Just Begun) Having My Fun, and the Neptunes \\"Co-Ed\\" remix of Boys featuring Pharrell.<br /><br />I see no reason why someone shouldn't want this album. It's a true piece of history. ALL of her songs since the start that have frequented the radio stations are present, for the most part.<br /><br />Well worth time, and money.
B000002MJC|5.0|1993 was the year that Depeche Mode shocked fans and non fans alike. They had with this album, SOFAD, as it is called by the the fans, changed their image, sound and look. Gone was the polished days of Violator and their 80's look. Dave Gahan has let his hair grow, grown a beard and acquired numerous tattoos on his body. Songs like I feel you, Walking in my shoes and In your room sound like nothing they had done before and the major inclusion of guitars was a nice addition. Even though some fans hated it. The problem is that Alan Wilders contributions on this album add nothing and he seems to be totaly out of sync. In my opinion he had over stayed his tenure as the replacement for Vince Clarke and he should have left after Violator. Dave sounds a bit harsh at times and I guess had to do with the drug abuse. Even so, I pin point the problem with Alan Wilder. He had totally taken control over the sound and now on this album he was running out of ideas and this makes the grade become 4 stars instead of 5.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|i was at work last night, listening to the radio and stockholme syndrome was played. i was like, wow, when i get home, i gotta check these guys out. so i did. not one worthless track! every song is just amazing. this is the kind of band i've been waiting for. a real band, not one of these whiny \\"actual copycat\\" bands like my chemical romance or whoever the eff else has the same exact voice. sure, matt's voice is somewhat similar to the singer of radiohead, but the lyrics, the music and everything, and his voice too is original. it is more of radiohead, mixed with queens of the stone age, hint of coldplay,  with some guitar riffs like that of system of a down, which forms, my friends, a great original rock band. not only did i download it all off i-tunes, but i am going to the store to buy the original copies as well because they deserve the money. great band.
B00005JNTV|5.0|I`ve always liked a lot what R.Rodriges has been making and this film is not exception, moreover he ( with a help of people like K.Tarantino and the author of the comic book ) goes further, digging real deep, exploring new levels of movie production. Here I wanna save all the technical details and stuff, since other people, among them-pro actors,have already done it in their reviews. I just want to point out at the reaction in the auditorium when I watched this stunning and breathtaking action. At first there were some laughs and jokes and giggling as the movie started-there are some episodes, unrealistic scenes-like \\"Marv\\", Mickey Rourke`s character, being hit by a car multiply,just stands up and keeps going as if nothing has happened-but you always keep in mind that that is a comic book movie version and it`s the way it`s supposed to be. And later on all laughs and jokes and stuff in the audience go down and then you can`t help but sence electricity in the air and tension all around-you yourself is a whole rack of nerves ready to explode...incredible feeling, I would even say there some emotions there not experienced by you before-probably that`s why there are so many dislikers out there-they`re just scared to death being dragged out of the \\"BOX\\" where they tend to live and function, and unfortunately, I hate to say that, in this country number of those people-who just \\"live comfortably\\" and see nothing but their narrow world around their eyes more and more increases in overwhelming tempo...I`m sorry, it can seem to have nothing to do with the movie itself, but I just tried to ground my theory about the audience that is far from being fans of this movie. <br />  So everybody-if you like to experience new things, explore new horizons and live-not to just exist-go to see the movie-you`ll be truly amazed and shaken. Thank you.
B0006IIKS0|3.0|I just rented the documentary and I decided to look at the Amazon reviews afterwards.  Over a year ago I reviewed St. Anger for Amazon and I basically trashed it.   Turn the clock forward and now we have a documentary that essentially chronicles the making of St. Anger.      I maintain that St. Anger was a major disappointment for the band.  It was poorly mixed, poorly recorded, snare drum-laden to a ridiculous extent, and with lyrics that would make James Hetfield from 1987 puke continously.  Now after seeing this \\"documentary,\\" we finally realize why St. Anger was so weak. They had cameras on them while they were creating it.  You have three extremely self conscious muscicians trying to make up stuff on the spot.  That's tough to pull off for anyone.  And it failed miserably.     But the film itself: is cleverly done, has great historical footage, and shows many flashes of the former greatness of this epic band.  The film might have been much better if it didn't concentrate so heavily on the current problems and the performance therapist they employed, and concentrated more on why they became the highest grossing cd sales band of the 90's.      In 1986, when Metallica released their incredible album, Master of Puppets, most metal bands were yapping out silly songs with hair sprayed up to the rafters with dark spandex,purple shoes with sparkles, and sunken cheeks with hair extensions for some of the slightly balding lead singers.  The overall IQ of metal music was low.  Metallica was totally different: Metallica wore holey jeans and battered black t-shirts and sang about pain and played their instruments so hard and heavy that it looked like their guitars would become sawdust and strings by the end of their show.  They were an incredible band.  That's what is missing in this film.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|It pains me to give a album with the name Dream Theater on the cover, a one star rank sorry, but its the truth, and i too didnt tough this day would come... but anyways i gotta say this album starts PRETTY well with As I Am, a nice heavy track and somewhat of a nice rythm, and also another of Petrucci's MONSTROUS solos BUT IT DIED THERE Next we have the continuation for the GODLY 6 degrees track, The Glass Prison, by the name of This Dying Soul. Even Heavier than As I Am, it would actually be nice to put this on an album, but emotionally speaking, it doesnt changes nothing from the last track and it just keeps it heavy with no high points and the same happens with the next TWO tracks!!!! Endles Sacrifice and Honor Thy Father just keeps you with that heavy fast and ignorant music. Completely unnecesary. And then it changes to Vacant, the WORST Dream Theater ballad EVER!!!! (I really couldn't found a bad ballad in DT till now) and the main line changes into Stream Of Conciousness, an really nice instrumental if they hadnt made that one mistake - They got it running for WAYYYYY too long, if they cutted a lot of things out of it and made it a 5,6 minute track it would be a lot more exciting, it kind of loses meaning on the middle of it And to the closure - In The Name Of God the same mistake of Stream Of Conciousness, too long. A complete meaningless \\"samba\\" part with John Petrucci getting faster than ever. If it Werent for that, this track would be a nice heavy and epic closure Not worth the money spent, sorry new guys Dream Theater started thinking that speed DOES matter and that what aint heavy aint good, all of this turned into this boring and fast CD. Perfect with you're beggining to get into Heavy Metal and wants to see how fast and heavy a human can go... but well aint that Iron Maiden eh? Just 30 years newer If you want heavy music well done, and not necessarily fast -> LaBrie's new work If you want a nice Prog Metal CD ----> Petrucci's new work Im waiting for the next album now, and for the first time with Dream Theater, im gonna download to sse if its WORTH buying
0385512058|5.0|I recently finished reading Never Eat Alone after it was highly recommended to me by several friends.  Not since Stephen Covey's 7 Habits have I read such a powerful, formative book that truly has the potential to change lives.   <br /> <br />Keith Ferrazzi is simply a genius.  He drives home the point that people are everything, not only as a means to climb the corporate ladder, but also, and more importantly, to realize happiness in your personal life.  And he teaches us how to create the kinds of relationships that lead to such prosperity.  Moreover, he attempts to offer us new perspective that will ultimately make us all better people. <br /> <br />If adopted, the principles outlined in this book are far more valuable than any formal education.  I've purchased 5 copies for my closest friends.
B00064WSN2|2.0|After the successful 'In the court of the Crimson King', which was ground-breaking, members of the original band were abandoning ship. Guitar player Robert Fripp was basically left with lyricist Peter Sinfield, but was able to convince most of the band to stay to help him complete a second album.     With that in mind, Fripp had to kind of keep things going along nicely, so, a lot of the material is quite reminiscent of the material on the debut, actually very similar indeed. Well, the first half of the album kind of reminds the listener of the first side of the first album. The second side is a mish-mash of new sounds.     There is a folky ballad called 'Peace' that is broken up and spread throughout the album, which doesn't add much. 'Pictures of a city' and 'In the wake of Poseidon' are both flat when compared with the songs they mirror. The only really good song is 'Catfood', an eccentric up-tempo song that is fun and kind of predicts the type of music the band would make later on in their careers. This could also be said of 'The Devil's Triangle', a very dissonant sounding song full of eerie noises, but it's not very good. Though would do much better later with 'Lark's Tongues in Aspic', 'Fracture' and 'The Mincer' with this type of thing. 'Cadence and Cascade' is a lot like 'Talk to the wind', but at least Gordon Haskell gives a fresh feeling, as does a slightly different arrangement.     Overall, this album is not King Crimson at their best. They can do much better, but at least it is enjoyable if you like progressive music, albeit rather an average 'prog' record. Rating **
B00005JNBQ|1.0|On the surface it is a comedy of the \\"pick on the nerd\\" variety. But really it is an emotional showcase of why kids that are typically defined as losers are that way. I cried because the way that kid grew up is terrible. His parents are either dead or deadbeat(it is never fully explained), he lives with his grandma and his 32 year old brother, and he is constantly ridiculed. It is not his fault that he acts how he does, it is a result of an upbringing where no one ever told him \\"I love you\\". He does dumb things that people make fun of him for, but those actions are the product of a terrible childhood. Walking out of the movie theater, I wanted to verbally harass all those people that were making fun of his actions and words. Was it a funny movie? Yes, but it made me sick to laugh at such a poor human being. The movie was definately in the vein of Wes Anderson films. I would have thought it was a Wes Anderson film if it were more somber and less ridiculous in some parts. It was very reminiscent of Bottle Rocket and I wish it was more somber so people would not take it at face value and mock the poor kid. This movie should have been about feeling bad for Napoleon but instead it was laughing at Napoleon. There did not seem to be much emotional growth at all for any of the characters in the movie and that left me disappointed. If the director really cared about the characters he would have edited everything into more somber, less over the top scenes. Also, the bonus extended ending, while funny, was also too over the top. Superb acting all around though.
6305388458|4.0|Of course not.  Because in this day and age, I would be branded as a heretic or labeled insane and thus thrown out of the way in an insane asylum.  With that out of the way, the Life of Brian is an accurate comedy brought to us by Monty Python that makes a VERY valuable and intelligent point about organized religion.  The Catholic Church (and others) have changed so much that it isn't even the same thing anymore.  People misinterpret things whether it be a gourd or a sandal, and it becomes completely out of hand.  I know that this isn't necessarily the right place to post it, but as an atheist, I feel that God exists to explain the unexplained.  With that out of the way, let's continue with the review.  It's absolutely filled with laughs.  I could hardly stay still when the roman guard had Brian correct the misspellings of his graffiti.  The Bigus Dicus scene is absolutely classic and the even more classic \\"always look on the bright side of life\\" (curse my lack of ability to whistle).  There are only a few problems with this DVD.  One, this is a poor DVD, there is only one disc, and hardly and extras worth paying attention to.  The far better Criterion collation version has that second disc that Holy Grail and Meaning of life possess yet for some reason for life of Brian is 30 dollars, whereas Meaning of Life and Holy Grail are significantly cheaper then the superior version of Brian.  The second problem which is not quite as irritating is that for me (and this may only have been for me) I find that their accents are a lot thicker in this film.  I enjoy the English accent as much as the next guy, but some times, I find myself going \\"what he just say?\\" and having to find myself rewinding so I can focus better to see what that last line was.  That still doesn't affect the overall impact and message of the film or its brave humor or its originality.  This movie deserves 5 stars but this DVD is getting 4 for the lack of features and inferiority to the overpriced 2 Criterion collection version.  The Life of Brian may challenge the idea of organized religion, but it is not made to offend anybody.  It makes a valuable point but the only ones who were really shocked or appalled by this film were us Americans.  Fellow reviewer Isala has explained why, so I won't repeat what they said.  If you are unsure of this film still, then rent it.  If you then find yourself offended, then you just have to loosen up and relax a bit.  That's pretty much all I have to say.  Try to get the Criterion collection for a low price if you're a big fan, but if you are a casual fan then this version will do just fine.  Hoped this helped.
B00003CX9E|1.0|I'm 45 years old. I have seen so many great films in my life. I think I'm old enough to know what film is good or bad. Who are those idiots calling Citizen Kane the best film ever made???? I wonder how many films those people have ever seen before saying such stupid things like that. It's extreamely absurd.

B00000J2KV|4.0|When I was an exchange student in Chile in 1969, I became familiar with the term \\"Lolito\\".  It was what they called a young person who acted like they were older than they actually were.  Back then in the US we called them \\"teeny-boppers\\".  I asked my Chilean friends where the term \\"Lolito\\" came from.  They were surprized that I didn't know the term since it was from an American movie.  That, and not the book or the movie, was my introduction to \\"Lolita\\". <br /> <br />I read the book by Nabokov some years ago.  It didn't appeal to me and, other than remembering that it was about an older man's sexual obsession with a 12 year old girl, I don't recall any of the plot.  I finally had the opportunity to see the movie last night and I was left with a mixed reaction.  This is a quality-made movie with excellence in directing, acting, writing, editing, and cinematography.  Peter Sellers gives an outstanding multi-role preformance and Shelly Winters and James Mason are very good in their roles.  Sue Lyon is probably better than I'm tempted to give her credit for because she creates a somewhat annoying personality of a youth at that age.  I was certain that I saw Miss Moneypenny from James Bond famein the role of Nurse Mary.  I checked it out and it was her.   <br /> <br />The movie diverts from the book in that the movie comes across as black comedy.  We are invited to see the humor in the sexual relationship between a sexual predator and a 14 year old girl.  I guess that is what black humor is supposed to do; make us laugh at situations not normally associated with humor.  I found myself drawn uncomfortably into the humor but I was more interested in what happened to the main characters.  This is where I felt that the movie let me down.   <br /> <br />\\"Lolita\\" is, for me, the tragic-comedy of the obsession of a man and how that obsession methodically destroyed him.  It is a brilliant movie in that respect.  However, there is a young girl whom, the movie leads us to believe, was \\"inconvenienced\\" by this premature sexual relationship with a man nearly 4 times her age.  There are a number of scenes which skillfully depict the loss of her youth but we tend to understand these sacrifices as a sort of \\"grounding\\".  Other than disappointment, we see little effect on Lolita.  She eventually picks up her life and goes on as though little if anything happened.   <br /> <br />I confess that I could be found guilty of over-analyzing an otherwise excellent movie but that is how I reacted to \\"Lolita\\".  It seems odd to say but, with the the modern-day \\"awareness\\" that grew out of political correctness, this movie probably found a more receptive audience in 1962 than it would have today.  Back then in was scandalous, today it would be considered insensitive.  I think I would have preferred to see \\"Lolita\\" when it was merely scandalous.  Maybe too much sensitivity makes us insensitive.
B0006399FS|1.0|I absolutely love every single U2 CD in different ways from October to ATYCLB - which was a relatively average CD as well.  <br /> <br />U2 have become charictures of themselves; sappy, aging, souless music industry veterans and the last of the great arena bands that are becoming as tired and predictable as the Stones have been for the last 15 years. <br /> <br />Achtung Baby was the last truly inspired U2 release, although Pop and ATYCLB had it's moments. <br /> <br />Atomic Bomb falls flat on it's face, why it has drawn the popularity it has escapes me.  I don't even want to go into the song list and pick it apart and come-off as a bitter old, pretentious U2 fan - because I'm not - although I am a bit bitter because I never thought I'd see the day U2 lost it. <br /> <br />

B00003CXCT|4.0|I have skimmed through a few reviews and the majority seem to be upset at the digital remastering of these films.  Since these films (the original theatrical ones) were a big part of my childhood, I have to agree that I would like to have seen the ORIGINAL versions released on DVD.  However, being a parent of children that are quite interested in ALL of the episodes (the new 3 and the old 3), I believe that the new generation IS the reason for the digital remastering of these classic films.  When I purchased this boxed set I kept warning my kids, \\"Remember, these films are real old and aren't going to look like the new ones with all the computer effects.\\". Then upon watching them I was thrown for a loop.  My kids had no complaints.  They actually told me that the movies didn't even look old.  So please keep in mind, for the consumer that sees these films as nostalgia, they will be disappointed.  But for the consumer that is supplimenting their video library to complete the Star Wars timeline for their children, EXCELLENT!!  Lets face it, nowadays the original Star Wars trilogy would not be up to par for the new generation of fans.
B000053V7Q|5.0|This re-working of footage shot during Elvis' Vegas 1970 concerts is amazing. <br /> <br />If you had to put something in a time capsule to summarize why Elvis was and is a phenomenon, it is this DVD..... <br /> <br />Originally released to theaters with extranneous footage, this special edition added more performances, cleaned up the image, and gave us an amazing 5.1 soundtrack. <br /> <br />Elvis' is shown at his best. He looks great. He sounds great, and we see who he really was. This is a magnificent achievement for a terrific price. <br /> <br />Don't pass this by!
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Degrading and down right morbid horror movie that is more in tune with The Rocky Horror Picture Show than the comic book that it's based on. Keanu Reeves was just terrible as the lead character and he should be banned from ever acting again. Sadly, his performance was not the worse in the movie. That honor goes to the transvestite who plays the angel Gabriel, who looks like a reject from a John Walters movie. Her performance is beyond bad and along with the embarrassing performance of the guy who plays a gay devil make this one of the worse films to ever come out of a mainstream studio.  The only and I do mean only good performance that comes out of this waste of film stock is from Rachel Weisz and her performance is so good in fact that in makes the movie uneven because you feel like you're watching a better movie with her on the screen instead of the garbage that is right in front of you. You actually begin to feel sorry for her after a while and hope that she and her character was able to escape the movie all together.  <br /> <br />May become a cult classic but it deserves the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment more.  <br />
B0000CDLA7|1.0|This album is not good. <br />In a way it's a shame I don't like it - it's been touted as Dream Theater's heaviest yet, closest to thrash metal, furthest from prog-metal. I like heavy metal; I like crunchy riffs; I don't mind a lack of melody. I saw Dream Theater cover Metallica's Master of Puppets in its entirety at a concert in New York, and it was awe-inspiring. I was hoping they'd take that early-Metallica influence and do something cool with it. Instead, they've come up with their most tedious album since... uh... their last one. Sigh. <br /> <br />Train of Thought is tedious in an entirely different way than Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was. While it's chock full of similarly forgettable songs, they're forgettable mostly because they consist in large part of tired heavy metal riffs played really fast over. and. over. again. Keyboards play a much lesser role on this album; I never thought I'd miss the presence of Jordan Rudess (for a while I blamed him for Dream Theater's decline into suck-hood), but jesus! Anything to get Petrucci to quit jerking himself off! <br /> <br />So, yeah - Train of Thought is basically devoid of memorable melodies (the ballad \\"Vacant\\" is laughable and extraneous); and although it contains a few riffs that are pretty potent, most of them sound recycled and, frankly, dull. And none of them are potent or interesting enough to sustain songs that almost invariably extend to ten exhausting minutes or more. <br /> <br />This review might be a little overly harsh. It just pisses me off that a band I used to like so much, and a band with so much techincal talent, can put out such garbage. I mentioned on a message forum that maybe Dream Theater should just become a Metallica cover band instead of trying to write their own songs. These days, I'd like them much better that way. It's going to take a serious turnaround for these guys ever to get my attention again. <br /> <br />Thank goodness I'm finished with this review, so I don't have to listen to this album ever again. <br />
B0000C8AVE|5.0|This is Brilliant Music from the Greatest Recording Artist Of All time. If you Still havent Heard \\"Blowing in the Wind\\" yet Then I Just Dont Understand you. Classic album and One of the best Rock Albums of the Rock Era.

B0007TKNII|4.0|I'm a sucker for music in a movie, so it is little surprise that, while I find the basic plot of this (one can hardly do it justice to simply call it a \\"film,\\") film ponderous and hideously melodramatic, the music transcends any shortcomings wonderfully and the end result is really spectacular.<br /><br />Yes, I have seen the stage version, and I had heard bad things about the movie version.  Actually, I liked the movie better because it was more colorful, more visually entertaining and grand, and the various effects available on film helped explain and reference the story with much more grace and grandeur than the limitations of a live set.<br /><br />I was not impressed with Gerard Butler's warbly singing voice as the phantom, but the rest of the cast was first-rate.  Emmy Rossum more than made up for his shortcomings as a wonderfully-talented Christine.  Minnie Driver was also a standout as a hilarious secondary character.<br /><br />Overall, it's a show of lights and sound and action that should not be missed.  You'll keep right on singing for days.

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|At the end of the last season Ryan (Ben Mc Kenzie) left to go to Chino with Theresa (Navi Rawat) and their unborn baby while Seth (Adam Brody), devastated by Ryan's departure left Newport, and Summer (Rachel Bilson). Meanwhile Marissa was forced to move by Caleb (Alan Dale) to move into his mansion with him and her mother Julie (Melinda Clarke). At the start of this season Ryan and Seth return to find that things have changed. Sandy (Peter Gallagher) and Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) have been renovating the Cohen house, Marissa is having a secret fling with her yard guy D.J (Nicholas Gonzalez) and Summer is happy with her new boyfriend Zach (Michael Casssidy). Both Ryan and Seth had been hoping for reunions with their ex-girlfriends but instead both found new love interests. Ryan met Lindsay (Shannon Lucio) and Seth met Alex (Olivia Wilde) at the bait shop, a new hangout for the gang where Seth gets a job. Hailey (Amanda Righetti) leaves Jimmy (Tate Donovan) to go to Japan for a new job. Caleb gets in legal trouble early in the season and it was revealed that he is the father of Ryan's new girlfriend Lindsay.Julie and Jimmy begin to have an affair until Marissa found out. She told nobody but her father left Newport. .Soon after that D.J realised that he was being used as a weapon against Julie and left Marissa. Seth and Alex decided to call it quits after their relationship failed to really take off which lead to Marissa embarking on a new lesbian relationship with Alex. Before long they were living together. Sandy was visited by an old flame, Rebecca (Kim Delaney). He almost cheated but his love for Kirsten prevailed in the end. Caleb decided to adopt his illegitimate daughter Lindsay but demanded a paternity test.The test proved that  Lindsay was his daughter but she decided to move to Chicago with her mother, leaving Caleb and Ryan. During the first half of the season, Seth and Summer had been growing close again which culminated in Summer leaving Zach at the airport tobe with Cohen. This resulted in the most spectacular kiss ever witnessed on the O.C. Seth was then obsessed with reuniting Ryan and Marissa. Marissa's girlfriend Alex was becoming increasingly jealous of Ryan, who was getting close to Marissa again. This caused the end of Marissa and Alex's relationship. Julie had been working on a new project, a magazine called Newport living starring - her. Carter Buckley (Billy Campbell) was recruited as the editor. Kirsten developed a crush on him. On the eve of the magazine being released a blast from the past named Lance (Johnny Messner) came to Newport to blackmail Julie. Julie had made a porn movie when she was young which Lance threatened to publicise unless Julie gave him half a million dollars. Julie asked Caleb for help, but the movie was shown. Ryans brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) comes to Newport and stays with the Cohens. He gets in trouble several times, and attempts to rape Marissa, who had recently got back together with Ryan. Zach came back in the picture and challenged Seth for Summer. Seth eventually won, declaring his love for Summer at prom. Kirsten had grown closer to Carter but realised that her husband meant more to her. She was driving home and declaring her love for him on the phone- when she had an accident. As she recovered, Sandy realised she had become an alcoholic. Julie and Calebs marriage had been on the rocks, with divorce looming. Julie was going to take matters into her own hands but decided not to at the very last minute. Caleb suddenly died of natural causes. Julie tried to save him but couldnt. The death of her father made Kirstens alcoholism worse. Everything comes to a head in the season finale, where some familiar faces return, people are put in danger amd people leave the O.C. The last few minutes of the season end in a cliffhanger which has to be seen to be believed.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent show and I would recommend this dvd to anybody.
078322687X|5.0|\\"The Breakfast Club\\" is one of the finest representations of emotion portrayed through images and music that I have ever seen.  Five people from completely different angles are able to break down the walls of popularity, prejudice, and judgment, and come together as friends.  If all films were made like this, the world would be in better condition than it is today.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I think this is maybe the worst album from DT. I'm completely amazed how unique their playing is and how much their songs vary in the previous albums. DT is unlike many bands... for example if you've heard one metallica album, you've heard them all, but every DT album is different. Again, they've made an album that's definantely different, but unfortunately it's no good. It's not that i don't like heavy stuff, it's just that i don't like DT:s heavy stuff. The reason heavy doesn't fit DT is James LaBrie. His voice is no good. I get cold shivers when he tries to scream high notes especially in the live performances... on the other hand his voice is nearly perfect in vacant and other albums like six degrees. On ToT his singing melodies are almost nothing compared to what they've been in many other albums. But why in the world does he rap in this album? Another dissapointment is Petrucci. How can, in my oppinion, the best guitarist in the world make this kind of s*it? How can his guitarplaying be so mindless shredding... no musicality at all. Every song on the album execpt vacant has a solo. Nothing wrong with that if the solos were good and would vary but they're all as fast as petrucci can play with no musical content at all. I just hate seeing such a good player doing this kind of music. Before his playing has been something that i've never experienced before. No guitarist in the world has made such great music that i never get bored listening to it. His live performances in the mid 90:s are incredible. For example Steve Vai is a good guitarist, but he's a bad musician. Most of his music is boring and unoriginal... it's meaning is only to show how technically proficient he is... I think petruccis playing has gone to the same point in ToT... his solos have no idea... or atleast if there were an idea you couldn't here it because it's played so fast its. Playing fast should be a tool to accomplish expressing a feeling for example or something. Fast parts should balancethe slow parts to make the music more alive. Speed shouln't be the purpose itself like on ToT it is. The album has it's good moments too. Vacant balances the albums heavy songs, and does a great job at it. Stream of Conciousness i think is the best song off of the album...the most musical and it has a good feeling to it in the name of god is also great but maybe a bit too long. As for the first 4 songs... they are awful. As i am,The dying soul and honor thy father sound almost like any angry teen music... they have their good parts also but it doesn't help much. Endless sacrifice has atleast some effort. After hearing other DT albums, it isn't just enough that the songs are ok, they have to have something that makes me listen to them over and over again. The 4 first songs definantly aren't those kinds of songs. I think everyone of you who read these appreciate good music... otherwise you wouldn't listen to dream theater. Because of this i have to suggest you all listen to a german band called Superior. I think it's the best that heavy metal as a genre can offer. The singer is amazing and their music is just incredible compared to train of thought. And if many of you consider Train of Thought good... well you should really listen to it. Please e-mail me if you something you would like to say or maybe try to convert me into liking the album :)
B00008IAMD|5.0|I think I should start off by telling you that System of a Down is my favorite band.  Nirvana and Gorillaz are up there too.  So, why am I giving a Johnny Cash CD 5 stars?  Well, the first JC song I ever heard was Folsom Prison Blues Live, and it changed the way I looked at country music (making me hate everything except Johnny Cash).  So, after I bought a greatest songs 3 CD set and realised that Rick Rubin produced 4 Johnny Cash albums (and I had already heard Hurt, which is such a good song) also produced System of a Down's albums, I thought it might be worth it to check out one of his 4 American Recordings albums.  So, interestingly enough this one was the cheapest of all 4 at Best Buy and came with a DVD of the Hurt music video, which is one of the most moving things I've ever seen.  If you don't like country, don't turn away from this CD.  I haven't heard the other 3 American ones, but this was very good.  The Man Comes Around is the song during the opening credits of Dawn of the Dead (2004) and it's one of the best songs.  Hurt, and the new version of Give My Love to Rose are very very good songs also.  This CD has a very somber tone, but some things about it are a little more up-beat like the last song, We'll Meet Again, which isn't really a sad song, but as you're listening to the somewhat happy tone of it and realizing it is the last song on Johnny Cash's last album, it's very moving.  I urge you to either listen to this somehow or just buy it, I don't think you'll be dissapointed in waht you discover.  Now I'm on a quest to get the other 3 American recordings CD's.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|In the past few years, I have fallen away from movies with Tom Cruise in them, feeling that he just hasn't been hitting the mark lately.  But under the direction of Michael Mann, Tom Cruise finds his pacing and delivers one of the best performances of his career.  Combine his character with the recent explosion of Jamie Foxx and you have the makings of a great movie.  Both Cruise and Foxx guide COLLATERAL to its explosive conclusion, all the while managing to shed light on their characters and explore real emotion.  I just could not find something not to like about this film while watching it.  The opening sequences are great, the dialogue is superb, and the imagery is extraordinary.  Los Angeles comes alive in COLLATERAL and Mann's picture seems to be a tribute to its scenic locations and nightlife.  I even noticed the quality of the soundtrack, not normally something to which I pay an inordinate amount of attention.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found COLLATERAL interesting because of the depth of its two main characters.  Take Cruise's character, for instance.  I was expecting a typical \\"hitman\\" character: no sense of morality, quick-decision maker, etc.  But what we get is someone who brings complexity to his position, someone who seems to develop a friendship & care for the cabdriver who has been ushering him around all night, someone who behind all of the grime has a personal code of ethics.  Of course, at the end of the day he is what he is.  But Cruise manages to squeeze a lot more life into the character than I had expected, particularly in the scenes where we learn about his childhood experiences.  Opposite Cruise stands Foxx, a simple cabdriver who has been putting off his dreams for twelve years, afraid of the commitment and the responsibility.  But he is also a man capable of great heroism and courage, witnessed several times throughout the film in short bursts.<br /><br />What I really loved about COLLATERAL, however, is how it manages to communicate the haphazard nature of life.  The opening sequence is particularly illustrative as Cruise only ends up in Foxx's cab as an accident.  Small decisions in this film have ripple effects that change the course of each characters' life.  This is not a film of fate.  It is a film of personal free will and the chaos of our decisions.  It is a film that preaches agency over the chains of predetermined outcomes.  And it transforms the audience as it transforms its characters.  COLLATERAL is one of Michael Mann's best films to date and an absolute must-see for everyone.the haphazard nature of life.

B0007OASII|5.0|This has got to be one of the best albums to come out so far this year.  Every track is highly epic and melodically beautiful.  The highlights are \\"When The Lights Go Down\\", \\"March of Mephisto\\", \\"Soul Society\\", and \\"The Haunting\\".  Most of the songs here are mid-to-uptempo, and the guitar and drum playing are really great and riveting.  I think this band could have a really big following if radio stations would only decide to play them.  Of course, with what tripe radio stations play today, any band that is really talented, or artistically gifted, usually has to scrape and claw to get played.  There is great promise for Kamelot, and if this album is any indication of the kind of music to expect from them in the future, then we are in for a real treat.
0792846443|4.0|Set in a secluded town in the snow-capped mountains, James Caan and Kathy Bates battle wits as a popular romance novelist and his obsessed fan in this wonderful adaptation of Stephen King's novel.  MISERY achieves everything it sets out to achieve, proving once again that Stephen King is a master of writing suspenseful, entertaining tales that both chill and delight.  Rob Reiner transfers King's talent beautifully to the big screen and the film manages to pull-off its suspense without any real violence.  Well...that is...almost without gruesome violence.  Those who have seen the film already (or have only heard about it) will be familiar with the famous \\"hobbling\\" scene.  But the success of the violence in this picture absolutely requires the non-violent suspense that saturates the rest of the film.  In addition to nail-biting suspense, King has managed to write a writer into his story, giving the film a bit of autobiographical realism and intrigue.<br /><br />What drives MISERY is the quality of its two main actors, James Caan and Kathy Bates.  Caan is perfect as the tortured writer, but Kathy Bates takes the cake.  Her performance as a psychopathic nurse, who is affected by dual personalities, is electrifying.  One just never knows when she is going to snap and I found myself on the edge of my seat in every scene that she is in.  The truly scary realization is that as the film progresses one begins to see that her \\"split\\" personalities are actually not split at all, but rather two sides of the same coin, each capable of horrific evil.  In this vein, the \\"battle\\" between the smart writer and the dim-witted fan becomes much more interesting as we realize that Bates is not as dim-witted as we were initially led to believe.  Because MISERY is primarily a film between two actors set in a single home (and primarily one room, at that), the audience becomes involved in the claustrophobia of Caan's situation and our feelings of helplessness only add to the tension the film creates.  Finally, I couldn't help but make some subtle comparisons to DEATHTRAP, another film of mystery and suspense that centers on a writer in a secluded cabin who is forced to write for his life.  While DEATHTRAP may keep you guessing, MISERY keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Overall, MISERY is pure entertainment and a pleasure to watch.  Stephen King has delivered yet another classic to both literature and film and all of the elements are here to make it last.  I highly recommend it if you like murder, mystery, and suspense.e film creates.

0807205567|5.0|My whole family (children 14 & mature 10 yr)was mesmerized by Tim Curry's voice reading this incredible tale. Quite often we would arrive at our destination and sit in the car because we couldn't tear ourselves away from the story. We have listened to the first three books and are now starting over after about a year break. I eagerly await future productions!
B0007Y08IS|3.0|for a long-time fan of south park such as myself (i've watched the show since it's inception), seeing \\"team america: world police\\" just feels somewhat stale.  many of the songs in this movie are retreads of things that have appeared in south park before.  \\"freedom isn't free\\" is based off a parody version of an alan jackson song in the \\"ladder to heaven\\" episode;  \\"montage\\" was featured in the \\"asspen\\" episode first.  in short, if you've seen everything matt and trey did for south park, you've seen everything in this film.  the dialog suffers as it's obvious that trey and matt did most of the voices, and as such that aspect of the movie quickly becomes monotonous.  \\"team america: world police\\" isn't as shocking or hilarious as many critics would lead you to believe.   <br /> <br />oddly enough, the vast majority of this film consists of liberal bashing.  in a time as serious and dangerous as the one we are in now where conservatives are the ones bungling everything they can get their hands on, it's kind of odd to see a film that portrays such destructive, negligent meatheads as bumbling, likable goofballs while those who are only guilty of having an opinion are the ones disemboweled in the end.  it's well known that matt and trey are right-leaning libertarians, which kind of makes sense as to why they hit the likes of michael moore and alec baldwin especially hard.  you'd think that a movie titled \\"team america: world police\\" would focus more on savaging the reckless, \\"let's go get em!\\" attitude of bush and his cronies than people who oppose his insane policies.  yeah, let's kill those whiny, annoying liberals who are only marginally influential and communicate their ideologies through peaceful means rather than the greedy plutocrats who wield the actual power to make war!  flag-wavers and republicans made very little noise about this movie because of this fact.  <br /> <br />to be fair, a lot has changed in iraq and in foreign policy since this movie premiered.  nobody knew for sure at the time this movie was made that bush would stay in office, the search for WMDs would end, that an iraqi election would make little to no difference, that osama bin laden would still be alive, and that a majority of the public would eventually feel that entering iraq was a mistake.  <br /> <br />
B00006HBUA|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS GREAT. LOT OF EFFECTS, COMEDY, AND ACTION. THE BEST PART WAS, SCOOBY/SHAGGY HAVE A PASSING GAS AND BELCHING CONTEST.   ALSO, THE SCOOBY DOO GANG BREAKING UP ALMOST BRINGS A TEAR TO YOUR EYE. SO, GET OVER IT! YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED.
B00000IPAX|1.0|I am disheartened to see that a band like this has recieved so much acclaim, and in turn, inspired dozens of other so-called \\"pop-punk\\" bands. Furst things first: this is NOT punk. Punk is The Clash. The Sex Pistols. The Ramones. Iggy Pop. The Buzzcocks. NOT BLINK 182. Blink 182 is a trio of suburban skateboarder losers who formed a lousy band and then wrote songs about skateboarding, girls, and living in the suburbs (some songs that actually had potential were then ruined by Tom DeLonge's whiny and annoying vocals). There is nothing punk about them and I'm appalled at how many teenagers refer to them as that. I secretly cringe every time I see a kid walk past me wearing a Blink 182 (or Good Charlotte, Sum 41, Simple Plan, etc., etc.) hoody, ripped black jeans, and sporting piercings and green hair. I can't help but \\"hate.\\" If only they knew. So by all means, waste your money on this uninspired excuse for an album and then compare it to classics like \\"London Calling\\" or \\"Lust For Life.\\" I dare you. You'll wish you never stared deep into that nurse's cleavage on the cover in the first place (which is the only reason many of my friends bought it, I'm sad to say).
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles is without a doubt the greatest popular piano player of all time.  This compilation of duets further emphasizes that he is most assuredly the man.
1563890410|5.0|This is by far my favorite Sandman volume, along with \\"The Kindly Ones\\". It really solidifies the title as a classic. I haven't read much better, in any form of literature, and I've read a lot. In this volume, Morpheus travels to Hell to free a lover he once wrongly damned ten thousand years ago after seeing the error in his ways (pointed out by his sister, Death). He arrives to find Lucifer about to leave. He has tired of his duties, and he leaves him with the key. Morpheus then has to deal with emissaries from dozens of old mythologies (Odin, Thor, and Loki from Norse legends, Anubis and Bast from Egypt, etc.) who want Hell for themselves.  <br /> <br />My favorite part is when Morpheus confronts the woman he once condemned and is forced to confront and atone for his sins. It marks the change in Morpheus' character that ultimately leads to his redemption for all the terrible things he did in the past in the name of his pride and ego. This is truly a literary accomplishment.
B0000009RX|5.0|This is a great album. Yet this was not merely an answer to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in fact the beatles have stated that Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was inspired by Zappa's first album \\"Freak Out\\"
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Don't listen to 1-star review  by \\"The Heretic.\\" Apparently this reviewer likes Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, and Janet Jackson (for all the wrong reasons. wink wink). This is a great album and a triumph of punk rock (which does not include such sex-craved fratboy reject bands like Blink 182, Sum 41, Yellowcard, Good Charlotte, the lists goes on and on).
6305313687|5.0|The firts time i saw this movie was three years ago.  I was simply astounded.  Then the more i saw it, the better it got.  i personally did not consider Edward Nortan one of the better actors of our time, but after this movie, he defenetly proves himself.  This movie deals with one of the biggest problems of our era: racism.  It shows the perspectives of both sides of the mirror. While watching the movie, you knew that what Derek Vinyard (Norton) was doing was wrong, but you understood his rage.  I personally think this movie is more worthy than many other movies of the same year. Basicly, the moral of the story is \\"Hate is Bad\\" (Furlong) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />P.S Dont listen to what other say, the ending is the best ending ever directed
1563890119|4.0|Neil Gaiman's \\"Sandman\\" is one of my favorite comic book series second only to Grant Morrison's \\"The Invisibles\\" (I find it only fair to add that the gap between the two is very, very small). This volume, however, I am sad to say is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong, its an excellent book and i loved reading every second of it, but I found it lacking when comparing it to Gaiman's later volumes.  <br /> <br />In this volume, Sandman (or Dream, or Morpheus, or the Lord Shaper...) is freed from an enprisonment that lasted over 70 years. He sets out to recollect his 3 objects of powers, and along the way encounters such DC residents as John Constantine Dr. Destiny, Martian Manhunter, Scarecrow, and Scott Free. It was these encounters that I found took away from the story. I could allow Constantine and Dr. Destiny, but Manhunter and the Escapist (Free)...? Vertigo titles taking place in the DC universe, I found, always found their strength distancing themselves from it.  <br /> <br />Luckily, in later issues, the DC universe and its characters are hardly mentioned, if at all, allowing Gaiman to really let lose without worrying about following any \\"rules.\\" The story picks up again (it was great until Morpheus stepped into Mr. Free's home) after Dr. Destiny escapes Arkham (he did it so easily, it took me awhile to get the injoke: villains are always escaping from Gotham's resident madhouse, so why should his breakout be any different?) and uses the power of Morpheus' stolen magic to manipulate the actions of customers at a local diner. His final encounter with the King of Dreams is terrific and the last issue of the book, which introduces Morpheus' sister Death, makes up for all the previous issues' misgivings. <br /> <br />So read the rest of Sandman; I can guarnatee you're in for a treat.  <br /> <br />

B00006RU5B|5.0|I've had this CD for ages, but never really thought to write a review... if you like Rage Against The Machine and Soundgarden, you'll like this because it's the \\"best\\" of both. If you don't like this album, the chances are pretty good that's because the glory days of Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine as separate entities are gone and passed, and this CD belongs to neither camp and so may feel like a cop-out. <br /> <br />Outside of the opinions, there are some pretty solid facts. There's no denying Chris Cornell's voice has never been better, managing to keep the richness of the vocals on his solo \\"Euphoria Morning\\", and yet getting back to the gutteral throaty screaming that made his name. The musical half of the group have some brilliant moments too, not quite as anthemic as the songs on the Rage Against The Machine debut, more laidback so the lyrics can be sung rather than spat. Then again, that's hardly suprising -- Chris Cornell's no rap artist. <br /> <br />Don't expect to be riled up against the \\"Machine\\" on hearing this. There's barely anything remotely political to this album. Instead you've got the Rage musicians settling into something more melodic (well, more than usual), without that ground-stomping edge. That rousing edge is more or less left up to Cornell's vocals. And don't expect to be over awed by naval-gazing stream-of-consciousness lyrics. Even though Cornell has his moments (I Am The Highway, Light My Way, The Last Remaining Light), for the most part the lyrical imagery is quite simple. <br /> <br />Song by song: <br />COCHISE ~ It's a perfect album opener, it couldn't have been placed anywhere else. It's a stomp-your-feet, crank-the-volume gut-buster. <br />SHOW ME HOW TO LIVE ~ This song sticks in the mind, and the chrous is catchy. Probably one of the more commercially appealing songs on the album, but it's still got a hefty pair of cajones on it. <br />GASOLINE ~ Not as rebel-rousing as the previous two songs, but it sticks in the head for longer the more you listen. Like a lot of Cornell's lyrics, there's a story hidden here somewhere waiting to be excavated... something about being driven insane by ghosts in a house you can't escape from, until your only option is to burn it and yourself to the ground. It's a grower. <br />WHAT YOU ARE ~ Similar to Set It Off in its rousing, stomping chorus, perhaps a simpler story. A good song, but one I rarely take great pains to pay attention to. <br />LIKE A STONE ~ Obvious classic. Tom Morello's solo is a thing of beauty, and even my mother likes this song. It's not the love song it appears to be (another Chris Cornell motif?, I'm thinking of Can't Change Me on Euphoria Morning). You can't really say anything bad about it, except that perhaps too many other people seem to feel the same way. That kind of rubs people up the wrong way, as if we think popularity equals commercial drivel... Get over it, it's just a magnificent song. <br />SET IT OFF ~ Anthemic, loud, foot-stomping... it's a war march kind of song, apparently inspired by witnessing a riot and Cornell wondering what could possibly have started it. <br />SHADOW ON THE SUN ~ At last! This is my favourite on the album, even ahead of Like A Stone, but it's not an immediate grabber. This one slowly creeps up on you from behind, lulling you into writing it off as simply another depression song... Then you get the incredible ending! I'm not a great fan of death metal screaming, but this is just brilliant. Cornell goes from a sluggish, bluesy singing style, just dripping with boredom and complacency, before exploding with pent up rage. Give this one a chance - I found myself moved by it whereas before I'd skip straight to I Am The Highway. <br />I AM THE HIGHWAY ~ The placing of this song is part of why it's so great. After the shock and emotional-beating of Shadow On The Sun, this slower and more thoughful song has a kind of calming, soothing, healing affect. No, it's never going to cure cancer, but itsettles your ears, and the more you listen it tugs at something inside you, where you want to shrug off past upsets and float above it. <br />EXPLODER ~ Probably as political as this album gets, if you take the opening lyrics (\\"Met a man locked away for things he hadn't done...\\") to mean an icon of innocence like, say, Nelson Mandela. The chrous is great, a heavier and more insistent way of getting to the sentiment of I Am The Highway ~ rising above and moving on, ignoring the naysayers. <br />HYPNOTIZE ~ This one although not a favourite of mine stands out in that it's nothing like the rest of the album. It's the most rap-like song in an album of mostly storming rock. Lyrically it's a selfless, self-help sort of song, like the downloads Give and Guilded Dreams I heard that didn't make the album (which itself is a tragedy, they're pretty good and could have saved some weaker moments). <br />BRING EM BACK ALIVE ~ Brilliant. It reminds me very much of Head Down on Soundgarden's Superunknown, with some very hallucinogenic lyrical images, and some great guitar work and thumping bass lines. <br />LIGHT MY WAY ~ This song falls into the same camp as What You Are for me... a good song, some really nifty more Rage-like guitar work, but not as good as the over all body of songs. <br />GETAWAY CAR ~ I love the opening to this slower blues-like ballad. \\"The first time I saw you, you were chasing down a cyclone all alone in a field with railyards and clovers, I kept rolling on, I never thought you'd wind up chasing me.\\" How can you not love that? <br />THE LAST REMAINING LIGHT ~ Again, not really a bad song, just perhaps a little too effective with it's depressing imagery and slow pace that even the more rock-like ending couldn't save. Probably this would have been better as a Euphoria Morning song; it would have fit perfectly. Here, like with Hynotize, it seems to not quite fit and derails the album a little, which seems worse since it's the album's closer. <br /> <br />Overall, it's just a damn good rock record... Groundbreaking? No. How much ground do you need to break? Soundgarden did it, Rage Against The Machine did it... is there anything left? What you have is a band of solid and original musicians with one of the best and most versatile modern vocalists, and in truth, there aren't many bands around that can claim that. <br /> <br />Perhaps overall Audioslave the album is more worthy of a four-star rating, but with standouts like Cochise, Show Me How To Live, Like A Stone, Bring Em Back Alive, and the awesome Shadow On The Sun, to not give them five stars would be a crime.
B000002JR8|5.0|For an album to stand the test of time, two critical things are needed: good production and great musicianship. It's safe to say that (Pantera's third album) \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" has both of these things, because, over a decade after its release, it's as great as it ever was.<br /><br />First, the production: I've never had a problem with the production on any of Pantera's albums (except for maybe their 1980's hair metal albums), and \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" is no exception. Production can be a bit tricky sometimes; some good metal albums have suffered from a bad production. For instance, take Megadeth's \\"So Far, So Good...\\" album: Megadeth did a great job, musically, (and the album sounded fine in the `80's) but, over the years, it has become more and more stale sounding. Terry Date, Pantera's typical lead producer, does a strong, robust job, here. The result is a batch of songs that are extra crunchy and have a harder edge on them.<br /><br />Next, the musicianship is, as always, top notch. More pummeling drums, puke stained vocals, and propulsive bass lines. But it's the guitars that, once again, dominate the maelstrom. When you hear the sludgy guitars on \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" bob, crunch, grind, start, stop, beep, pound, shriek, thump, groove, ascend, descend, downshift, cascade, soar, run, surge, shake, rattle, and steam roll (and about everything in between), you know it's just another day at the office for Dimebag Darrell.<br /><br />\\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" has rushing iron riffs, a thumping beat, and good drumming (especially in the beginning). The mid-section is slower, but after that, things pick up where they left off. The middle of this song also has a riff that goes up and down, like it's running over hills. Did I mention this song also has Phil's constant howling? Plus, there's a slow breakdown about halfway through.<br />\\"Becoming\\" has off-kilter guitars, a mini-solo, and fast double bass drumming (which become especially apparent at the end.)<br />\\"5 Minutes Alone\\" is a fan favorite that would have been well suited to be on of the album's first singles. It's grinding guitars, staccato vocals, and great chorus make it a fan favorite. And the slow bobbing guitars at the end are tailor made for headbanging.<br />\\"I'm Broken,\\" a single, has a groovy guitars and another pounding beat. Dimebag lays down a great, snowballing solo here, as well.<br />\\"Good Friends...\\" finds Phil making all kinds of weird noises. One moment he's calmly growling, one moment it sounds like he's, um...taking a dump, and the next moment he's whispering, and, finally, it sometimes sounds like he's coughing! The guitars on this one are usually supple and restrained, but this song is a highlight because of Phil's abnormal vocals and downright perverted lyrics.<br />I enjoy how the beat of \\"Hard Lines\\" shifts gears. It slows down, then speeds up, then slows, down, then speeds up.<br />\\"Slaughtered\\" has a machine gun intro, more low, gruff singing, and chugging guitars (which chug fast, pause briefly, then chug again).<br />\\"25 Years\\" has a skipping beat, similar to \\"We'll Grind that Axe for a Long Time\\" (from 2000's \\"Reinventing the Steel\\") and \\"Shedding Skin\\" not only has an appetizing title, but also three guitar solos! The first one is, of course, very good, the second (my personal favorite) has two parts to it, and guitar solo number three ascends like a steep mountain.<br />Finally, \\"Planet Caravan,\\" originally done by Black Sabbath, is a good cover but also a good song in its own right (and a great closer!) Its soft percussion (what sounds like-I'm not saying they are, they just sound like-tribal drums) and dreary, spacey vocals give this song a dreamy feel. Pantera give this song their own sound while also remaining true to the original. Pantera several covers (\\"Hole in the Sky,\\" \\"Cat Scratch Fever,\\" \\"Electric Funeral,\\" and this) and did `em well. I predict that if Pantera had remained a band, they would have turned out a covers album in a couple of years.<br /><br />So,  \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" is close to but falls just short of its predecessor, \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" in terms of greatness. This album may not be the standard setting landmark that \\"Vulgar\\" was (it's not as innovative as that album), but the bone crunching riffs and energy that bounces off the walls make almost every song on this album a hit.<br /><br />Plus, you know it's got to be great. What other album is as heavy as this and debuted at number one on the charts?to but falls just short of its predecessor, \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" in terms of greatness.

B0007KTBIU|5.0|If you're looking for Pocahontas just for the kiddies, then it doesn't matter if you buy this edition or the older one.  But if you're an adult fan of Disney, you'll definitely want the 10th Anniversary DVD.  First, I compared both versions on in a high-end home theater with a 133\\" projection screen.  The older DVD was very grainy and the colors were washed out.  On this edition, the picture was simply stunning.  It is crystal clear with beautiful colors.  This is a DVD to pop in and show off your home theater.  The audio is superb.  Second, if you are a fan of Pocahontas, then the added scenes are worth the price alone.  I can see why the song was originally cut.  It probably seemed odd to have Smith singing while tied up.  Those restored scenes really belong.  If you're a crier then make sure you have a box of tissues handy.  With the amazing quality and new scenes, it was like watching it for the first time.  Highly recommended!!!
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Rating: 3 stars compared to Heartbreaker/Gold, 5 stars compared to most what's out there<br /><br />Ryan Adams, the self-appointed 'savior of rock' has had a couple of rough years. After the excellent double whammy of the 2000 \\"Heartbreaker\\" and 2001 \\"Gold\\" albums, Ryan lost the pedals for a while (under pressure from his label), resulting in the dreadful \\"Rock'n'Roll\\" and the somewhat better \\"Love is Hell\\" albums (I'm leaving out the \\"Demolition Tapes\\" out-takes album). \\"Cold Roses\\" is supposed to be the return to the 'real' Ryan Adams sound.<br /><br />\\"Cold Roses\\" (2 CDs, 18 tracks, 76 min.) indeed does mark a return to the alt-country sound of \\"Heartbreaker\\", but hey, guess what... it's just not nearly as good. Listening through the 18 tracks, they are pleasant, but... not really memorable. I have listened to this album a number of times, and honestly, I can't recall any of the tunes when I'm done listening to it. I know it's not fair, but compare this to \\"Heartbreaker\\", when every single tune grabbed you and was instantly memorable. Same (to a slightly lesser degree) with \\"Gold\\".<br /><br />Interesting is that this album is credited to \\"Ryan Adam & the Cardinals\\". All the songs are also credited to the full band. I saw Ryan and his band perform some months ago here in Cincinnati, it was the weakest of all of his shows I have seen over the years. I don't know what Ryan needs to do to right the ship, but it definitely feels right now that Ryan hit his peak in 2000-2002, and that now he's just trying to recreate that. \\"Cold Roses\\" is a good attempt, but it falls short. Still, compared to the majority of the music on mainstream radio, this is a masterpiece of course.<br /><br />PS Can someone tell me why this album is on 2 CDs when it would have easily fit on 1 CD? The wonders of the music industry...
B0007N1AI6|4.0|I was really skeptical when Halford rejoined Judas Priest. Could they make a good record? Jugulator was a good album, but lacked diversity. Demolition is one of the worst albums I own. Angel Of Retribution delivers what most fans would expect, namely traditional metal. The positive thing about it is that it is mostly well played, ranging from crunching songs like \\"Judas Rising\\" and \\"Demonizer\\", ballads like \\"Angel\\", mid tempo stuff like Revolution and epic stuff like Lochness. Rob Halford does a great effort, wizefully not using too much high vocals (he has to sing them live).  <br /> <br />There are also a few negative aspects. The album lacks new elements. Everything you hear has been played before in the large metal history. The solos do not really improve the songs like they did in the past. I also would have preferred faster songs like \\"Painkiller\\", \\"Exciter\\", or \\"Metal Meltdown\\". I also do not really like the epic song Lochness. The lyrics are cheesy and it should not have lasted more than 13 minutes. There are way better epic tracks. It is the last song on the album and I always tend to stop the album before that song begins.   <br /> <br />To conclude: It is by far not their best record, but it is not bad at all. Musically it is a mixture of Painkiller, the early eighties albums and small hints from their seventies releases. Influences from Jugulator or Demolition cannot be found. I personally like Halford's solo releases more, but if you prefer classic Priest then you can really enjoy the album. If you want something new then check out other bands.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Strong characters, solid performances, great stories, high production value.  It's a typical Star Trek, which means the bean counter morons in TV once again kill off the only TV programming worth watching.  Thank god for DVD. <br /> <br />I have to say too that the theme song was better in the first season.  The slower pacing and tempo allowed the show's premise to settle into the mind.  Unlike many Trek fans, this long time Trek fan thoroughly enjoyed Warren/Watson's theme tune.  It was a perfect change that fit the show's distinction as a prequel to all the rest.  Fans who dislike it simply are missing the bigger picture and ought to go check their emotional disconnect with a local betazoid counselor. <br /> <br />It's a perfect buy.  Fans got cheated with the significantly premature ending of this superb series.  Someday the artists are gonna take over and the bean counters will be unemployed.  bwahahaha!
B00006IU73|5.0|I recently discovered Porcupine Tree through a prog-rock website and found them interesting, so I purchased the new Deadwing CD and at first felt that it lacked excitement.  But it grew on me after a few listenings.  I can't say the same about In Absentia.  I bought this CD because I'll be seeing them live soon and My God, this may be one of my favorite albums of all-time and I'm 46 years young.  I felt this way upon the very first listening, which is unusual because I usually have to give most new CDs time to digest.  The myriad of emotions that evolve from Steven Wilson's impeccable song writing and charming vocals is exceptional while utilizing layered keyboards with a nice blend of acoustic and distorted guitars.  The rhythm section provides a nice core without going overboard that sometimes emerges from many prog-rockers.  This is a must own for any music lover looking for something unique.
0553296981|4.0|I really like this story because it gave such a personal description of the Holocaust. Unlike most descriptions of the Holocaust, this one gave the most voice and feelings. This diary also gave a lot of historical information on the Holocaust and gives an inside look on what happened.
B00005NTNM|4.0|You gotta give Harry Callahan credit for taking the law seriously.  When hoods robbing a liquor store demand a car, he gives them one; he doesn't smile much but he makes great wisecracks; and Clint Eastwood made five of these movies, all of which basically show us the cowboy's way is probably the best way to deal with the loonies he's given to chase.  In this one, Harry goes after a supposed citizen's group who are really nothing more than a bunch of psychopaths killing for money.  This group is even supported by a young Catholic priest, and in one ironic scene, Harry kneels in the communion line just to tick he priest off.  Tyne Daly is very good as Harry's partner, a big issue in the seventies, when female cops were far and few between.  A talented bunch of character actors lend good support:  Bradford Dillman, Harry Guardino, John Crawford and Albert Popwell particularly.  The movie is dated in its music and in some of its philosophies, but the Dirty Harry movies were not meant to be great social commentaries; they were a vehicle for the star power of Eastwood and giving the bad guys their due whether it was politically correct or not.  And in that case, THE ENFORCER delivers.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Dream Theater is Giving Prog A BAD NAME- yeah- I said it- This isn't prog AT ALL!! I saw another reviwer mention that DT WROTE THIS ALBUM IN THREE WEEKS- well, ITS TRUE!! unreal- im so man- sad, pissed, I FEEL USED, ABUSED- well, you see- this album is balls.
0060926317|4.0|As practicing meditator I was captured when reading the book. It's not the way Marlo Morgan is writing, it's the message. Obviously she knows less about Buddhas teachings or The Way Things Are. But with every sentence and statement of the Aboriginees it's proving the message. <br /> <br />When reading other reviews I see that there are many disturbing emotions and that people feel criticized in their way of life and thinking.  <br /> <br />But that's like allways: We all have a free will and can decide free what way we want to live (I'm not US-American, but there the constitution is one of the best documents ever written!). And nobody has the right to judge what anbody's choice is.  <br /> <br />I feel that those, who critize the book so harsh, are full of fear that their choice might be false. From here the best wishes for all. May they find a way to live in peace with the truth.
0743201140|4.0|The authors of Now, Discover Your Strengths say \\"Most organizations are built on two flawed assumptions about people:   <br /> <br />\\"1.  Each person can learn to be competent in almost anything. <br />\\"2.  Each person's greatest room for growth is in his or her areas of greatest weakness.\\" (p. 7) <br /> <br />They say that the best managers follow two other assumptions that are somewhat contrary to these:  That \\"each person's talents are enduring and unique\\" and that the greatest opportunity for growth for each person is in developing more fully his or her greatest strength.  In doing so, these managers focus on the outcomes of their employees' efforts, rather than forcing them into a particular pattern.   <br /> <br />The way to truly excel is to build on your strengths.  They say that you cannot change a weakness, though you can learn to compensate for it.  Furthermore, you can only excel \\"by maximizing your strengths, never by fixing your weaknesses.\\" (p. 26) <br /> <br />A strength is something you are able to do consistently and enjoy doing.  Your talents, knowledge and skills combine to create a strength, with \\"talents\\" being the most important element.  \\"The key to building a bona fide strength is to identify your dominant talents and then refine them with knowledge and skills.\\" (p. 30) <br /> <br />The key element of all this is the StrengthsFinder Profile, a 180-question survey.  Over 30 years, the Gallup Organization interviewed two million successful professionals, asking open-ended questions about their strengths.  From these interviews, the authors identified the 34 most prevalent strengths and developed the StrengthsFinder Profile, an online assessment instrument to help you identify your five strongest \\"themes of talent.\\"  A talent may not yet be a strength but it can be developed into a strength.  The book includes a description of each of the 34 StrengthsFinder themes so you can get a brief overview of your five key strengths and read about other strengths.   <br /> <br />To take the assessment, you must buy a copy of the book or audio-book.  Each purchase entitles one person to take the StrengthsFinder Profile one time.  If you want to know the strengths of your staff or your friends, they will each have to purchase the book and take the assessment. <br /> <br />One reviewer said that Now, Discover Your Strengths may be a better pop psychology book than a management book.  This is probably true.  The biggest thing that I took out of the book was an understanding that, to a large extent, I should accept my weaknesses and focus on my strengths and talents.  I had each of my staff take the assessment so we could then consider how to best utilize and develop our talents to find greater success and avoid frustration and burn-out.
B000002VCT|3.0|This album has the great modern synthesizer instrumentals together with strings that you'd expect from The Project crew. The instrumentals are just superb new age material. Songs like \\"Can't take it with you\\" and \\"one more river\\" tell a good story to set up the concept album, and use good riffs and good songwriting in general. \\"Pyramania\\" is kind of a funny song probably thrown in for an unexpected change of taste. The last song is kind of slow and boring and the whole album is very short, maybe only 30 minutes long. Still worth owning, they really did make superior music in the 70's and 80's and this band was a front runner and trend setter. I've seen references to the Moody Blues, Yes, and others as possible fans who would like this band. I dare to offer maybe some other examples people may not have identified as being similar to this band or this album. If you liked early \\"Journey\\" albums and also the early stuff they did with Jonathan Cain you very well might like the 70's and early 80's Project albums. Fans of the \\"Babys\\" flavor of progressive rock might also like this stuff. Pat Benatar, Blondie, also are at least partly similar to this band.
B00078XGRO|4.0|Forget Star Trek - Insurrection and Nemesis.   ST - First Contact still rules among the Star Trek TNG movies, and is also a damn good sci fi flick even outside the Star Trek fold. I'm a die hard Star Trek lover but I've had it said again and again by people not so much into it - \\"First Contact was a really good flick\\" Even the fact that people, incl. myself often leave the franchise name out, and simply call the movie \\"First Contact\\" is a good indicator of its great stand-alone status. This is all very ironic - and quite an achievement since the story or First Contact is a direct follow up of an event that took place in the ST TNG TVshow (\\"the Best of Both Worlds\\") and none of the other ST movies are.     The villain of this movie is a cybernetic race called the Borg. Their major creepiness lies their habit of capturing other humanoids and turning them into one of their own. The victims face a horrifying transformation, as limbs and other body parts are being chopped off and replaced by cybernetic devices, turning them into half robots. What's even more terrifying is that they're being jacked into the Hive Mind. Every trace of individual personality erased. So, it's one of those creepy \\"Alien\\" concepts - one less of us means one more of them, which I can't get enough of.     Ok... enough praise.  The DVD qualities are well above average, just because of sheer abundance, but not very entertaining. Sure, there are some interesting documentaries on building sets and scale models etc. But mostly it's the actor/producer/writer people all sitting there doing the same tired old \\"oh he is such a talented and creative person, and I'm so proud to have been working with him\\"-thing as usual. I would like a little more insight to the special FX work and some bonus hardware like a collectible figurine or a specially customized case or something would have been nice. It IS \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" after all. There are plain DVDs and even VHS's that deserves that title betterthan this one.    SO, you really have to ask yourself. How much of a Star Trek fan are you? How interested are you in \\"the Making of\\"-documentaries, and most importantly, how badly do you need know how much Rick Berman admires Jonathan Frakes's talents as a director? If none of the above interests you, I suggest you buy the regular cheaper copy, with no extra features and ONE GREAT MOVIE on it. After all it's the movie we love, right?
B000002VC5|4.0|Alan Parsons and head songwriter Eric Woolfson were the standard by which all modern music was measured for as long as they were making albums. Way back in the late 70's this album was a real stunner. It still sounds like \\"modern music\\" even today. I still hear \\"I Robot\\" on the new age radio station around here. The Project albums, especially the early ones like this were real good at delivering the unexpected. No two songs sound alike but there is the Parsons engineering and basic sound throughout. I like the concept albums they did, they make the whole album worth listening to instead of just buying for a single or two. This band, I feel, is accurately described as a mesh between new age, rock, and pop and they have pulled it off with every album, I think. I Robot is full of cool synthesizer sounds coupled with great hooks, transitions, bridges, beats, guitar and rhythms. The guys really pulled off what most other bands would never try. No other group like this. If you're looking for something different and deeper, try this album.
0767821629|4.0|This movie is a clever tale of virtual realities within virtual realities within virtual realities, ad infinitum.  But that's not apparent at the beginning so forget I mentioned that if you are a new viewer of the film.  It starts off as a mystery story in a virtual world set in an historical backdrop.  But things are not what they seem.  Comparisons to the Matrix are not totally unfounded, but there are stark differences to the tone and story of these films.  The 13th floor has a great ending that does leave you thinking hmmmm....  I enjoyed it but can see how it lacks the style and clever symbolism and dialogue that have made Matrix films such a big phenomenon.  If you like this genre this is a terrific film to see and get you thinking about the nature of reality and what it would be like to be an artifically generated intelligence.
6304508611|5.0|Stunning performances from an all-star cast (especially from Sissy Spacek as the sweet Carrie and Piper Laurie as he psychotic mother), a marvelously adapted script from the original novel, a beautiful music score and Brian De Palma's incredible visuals help to make this chilling film what it is: an absolutely terrifying classic of modern horror.
B00000K0E5|5.0|I have all the bonds movies on DVD, but every time I see one on tv I catch myself watching them. Yes, some are better than others, but all and all it's still Bond and Goldeneye is no expection. I enjoyed it start to finish just like every Bond. Pierce Brosnan's at the top of his game and I hope to see him in a few more movies, but who ever they pick to be the next Bond I'm sure will be good. I would give this movie ten stars if I could!
