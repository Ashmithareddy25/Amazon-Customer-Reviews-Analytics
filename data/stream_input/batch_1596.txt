0071636080|5.0|Awesome book. Thank you Carmine Gallo for writing it. I'm a teacher and I'm always looking for better ways to deliver information to a class and this book is perfect. Highly recommended. Part of the appeal for me is that I love my Apple products and I admire Steve Jobs and his presentation style and ability to sell you something (without ever feeling like you're being sold to) - He's the MASTER! He stands out from any other presenter I've seen and it's so great to have a book that analyses his style. Funny thing is I'm only halfway through the book but it keeps getting better and better and I know the rest will be amazing. Easy to read, well organised, and entertaining. I've only started to incorporate multimedia into my classes. I've learnt the technology late in my career but having this book and access to Steve Jobs's product launch videos on YouTube will give me an edge and help me use the technology in a much more effective way.<br /><br />Thanks again Mr. Gallo.

0553345834|1.0|I'm fascinated by books about business and personal development and recently picked up a used copy of Mark H. McCormack's book, What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School.  This book came out in 1984 and was a New York Times Bestseller.<br /><br />Let me just say this.  There's a reason they don't teach this rubbish at Harvard!  It's bad business!<br /><br />I was managing to muddle through the text fairly well even thought I didn't agree with much the author was saying.  Then I got to page 51.  Allow me to share some of the text:<br /><br /> \\"Taking the edge is the gamesmanship of business.  It is taking everything you know about others and everything you have allowed them to know about yourself and using this information to load the deck- to tilt a business situation slightly to your advantage.  It is winning through intuition.<br /> In the beginning, it is a matter of doing your homework, knowing the players, and all knowable aspects of the game.  And in the end it is knowing how to play the game itself - figuring out what people want or convincing them of what they want and finding a way to give it to them.  The idea, of course, is to give slightly less than you get in return.\\"<br /><br />Wow!  Look at that last sentence!<br /><br />\\"The idea, of course, is to give slightly less than you get in return.\\"<br /><br />That is a shocking revelation about the nature of Mr. McCormack's heart.<br /><br />This is the sort of garbage one would expect to hear from a lawyer.  This is the stuff that gives businesspeople a bad name.  If I ran my business this way, I'd be out of business.  Though I would agree it's important to come to the negotiation table well informed, I disagree with nearly everything else he says!  He seems to think that the point of reading people is to take advantage of them!<br /><br />The idea of business is NOT to give less than you get in return.  That description actually fits a SCAM, not a business.  The idea of business is to provide a great product or service that adds value to people's lives!<br /><br />Good businesspeople don't try to give less than they get!  They give more!  And in giving more, they find themselves fulfilled by serving others and at the same time attract a lot more business!<br /><br />Mr. McCormack has somehow gotten the idea that in order to succeed, you have to befuddle and hustle the guy on the other side of the table.  The reverse is actually true.  You actually have to serve the guy on the other side of the table if you want to succeed.<br /><br />This idea of \\"taking\\" the other guy in order to make a profit falls into the \\"love of money\\" category discussed in 1 Timothy 6:10.  This verse basically says that if you are willing to do underhanded things to get money, you love it, and you will end up causing yourself many sorrows.<br /><br />Please do not follow Mr. McCormack's advice.  It is not the path to happiness or success.great product or service that adds value to people's lives!<br /><br />Good businesspeople don't try to give less than they get!  They give more!

For me this was a poor example.  And although many readers had plenty of insulting reviews of the 50 books and their lack of originality, poor grammar, and overall disappointment - not me.

B008GX2YQQ|4.0|Animal Collective have been trying almost singlehandedly, to drag alternative rock music into the future for well over a decade now and for their commitment alone I think they deserve considerable praise. Retro, retro, retro is what so many bands have been content to strive for in the 21st century, so it's always comforting to know that when Avey, Panda, Geologist and Deakin get together you're going to hear something truly original. Centipede HZ the bands ninth studio album follows this brave formula and even though I'm not totally in love with every song on here, I'm happy to report that for the most part it's another triumph for the Baltimore band.<br /><br />Animal Collective's serpentine mantra of constant evolution has meant that Centipede Hz has only a few remnants of what made their 2009 breakthrough album Merriweather Post Pavilion such a unanimous success. Instead they've opted for a more Chaotic and live feel this time round, with explosive percussion, Mutant guitar and Avey tares frenetic vocals featuring heavily on most of these songs. Producer Ben Allen has been brought back again though and the inviting pop tinged electronic sheen he helped to perfect on MPP is the one thing he's managed to carry over onto Centipede HZ.<br /><br />This hybrid has created some of the most unique songs of 2012, \\"Todays Supernatural\\" has been circulating for a while now but its carnivelesque instrumentation, ¾ time and Avey Tare's bug eyed mini chorus still make it a bewildering listen after repeated spins. \\"Applesauce\\" \\"Father Time\\" and \\"Monkey Riches\\" are also completely unhinged but utterly beguiling in the way only an Avey Tare fronted song can be. His vocal screeches on these songs strike a fascinating balance between Billy Corgan's yelp and Black Francais's growl and sonically the plethora of noise and melody the aforementioned songs are packed with, threaten to overload the cerebal cortex to the state of combustion. That may not sound particularly appealing on paper but if you're into extreme, futuristic pop you'll be sure to get a kick out of hearing these songs.<br /><br />The less abrasive moments on the album certainly come as a welcome addition though; \\"Rosie OH\\" is one of the few songs where Panda Bear takes microphone duties and although there are still a tonne of electronic effects and goodness knows what else polluting the track, his mellower voice helps to keep you invested in the crazy cacophony that follows. Deakin also sings for the first time too on \\"Wide Eyed\\" and it's another opportunity for the listener to catch his breath, as his voice is also rather sedate and accessible in comparison to Avey Tare's.<br /><br />The otherworldy maelstrom the band have whipped up on Centipede HZ make it tempting to label it their Saucerful of Secrets, but I think that description implies AC have suddenly gotten a lot more serious again ala Here Comes The Indian. I don't feel this album is meant to genuinely freak you out; it's essentially a thrill ride of experimental fun with the band openly inviting you join in at particular moments (just listen to the laughs at the end of \\"Wide Eyed\\" and the goofiness of \\"Applesauce\\". As I alluded to earlier there were times where I found myself a little drained by all of the giddiness and eccentricity, nevertheless I'm charmed by their continued enthusiasm to still bring something new to table 12 years into their career, CHZ it's not as ground-breaking as MPP or as flat out brilliant as Sung Tongs or Feels but it Is undeniably as eclectic as those impressive works. Chicha music, avant-garde, Electronica and a myriad of other genres have been brought together on Centipede HZ to create a thoroughly exciting tour de force of indefatigable pop.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn's first novel may tackle tough subjects, but she does it with confidence and imagination, in particular her main character's issues with cutting and how she - literally - gets under her skin.
B005MMY5RK|5.0|Recently I reviewed the 2011 Academy Award -winning film The Artist and commented in that review that the silent movie directors and producers of the 1920s (the actors I am not quite as sure of) would have given their eye-teeth (or at least their first born) to have had the technology available now back then to produce higher technical quality films. I am not so sure that I could say the same about director Orson Welles' 1941 film classic, Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Oh sure some of the technical stuff today could (and has on the remastered versions ) enhance the sound, and  maybe some of the production values but this magnificent film does not rely on technical skill so much (although some of the scenes and backdrops are of high quality) as the driving plot line, the script, and above the acting of director Orson Welles's merry band of Mercury Theater players (think Joseph Cotton, Agnes Moorehead, Everett Sloan and, oh yes, Orson Welles, among others).<br /><br />The plot line and the way it unfolds beginning with a clever news-of-the week video of Charles Foster Kane's life after he passed away to bring us  up to speed really is something to watch. Of course it did not hurt that this piece was a thinly-veiled portrait of the famed newspaperman and arch imperialist war-monger (the Spanish-American War and other little adventures be exact) William Randolph Hearst. He of \\"yellow journalism\\" fame although today he would be strictly minor league, maybe scandalous in Toledo or someplace like that.<br /><br />Then to have the strong cinematic personality of actor Orson Welles (shown as well in other films like Falstaff, The Lady From Shang-hai, and The Third Man) play that strong Hearst personality just added to the drama. As well as did the flashbacks by various parties who knew Kane, had worked for Kane, had loved Kane, had hated Kane or were just pure baffled by him. And then that dramatic undercurrent throughout the film of Kane's characteristic that would banish him from the godly pantheon, his utter incapacity to love anybody but himself that left him alone at the end. Yet he was still able to go back into deep childhood to remember the good part of his life, the part many of us harken back to as we age. We all, or almost all, have our Rosebud memories and maybe that is the connecting thread to the continuing relevance of this classic film. Just make sure you don't go for popcorn or something out in the kitchen at the beginning of the film, okay. Trust me on that please.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins sucked me in from the first page creating a world full of real characters and thoughtful situations. It was also nice to see such a strong female protagonist. I've read it more than once and purchased the other two books one after the other. Some of the best YA I've read.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this is a great game. I love a whole lot. I almost completed the whole entire game. it is awesome.
0812993292|5.0|A wonderfully warm and moving novel about a retired British gentleman of no particular distinction who walks from the southern end of England to the northern end to try and save the life of an old friend dying of cancer.  What he really saves is himself and his marriage and the pilgrimage has less to do with the walk across England than his journey to discover himself.<br /><br />The novel has a slow start, develops slowly, and nothing dramatic ever really happens.  Nevertheless it is oddly compelling and hard to put down.  You come to really care for the main character and his wife and try to work out the puzzle about their son.  I imagine that this book would not appeal to many younger readers as it explores coming to terms with ones limitations, disappointments, and mortality.  These issues seem very pertinent to this reviewer at age 60, but may not be compelling to a 30 year old.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in the parallels between Harold Fry's fictional pilgrimage and the real pilgrimage experiences of people that have walked the Camino de Santiago (see, for example, [[ASIN:0743261119 Off the Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim's Route into Spain]]).  There are strong parallels and I think that the author, Rachel Joyce, really understands the pilgrimage experience and makes it believable in this novel.<br /><br />Good writing, likeable characters, and a moving ending - recommended.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|The third installment of 50 shades was missing about 49 shades. The first two books were engaging and I couldn't put them down.  I only finished the third one because I wanted to finish the series.  The book was far too sappy and didn't have any of the excitement from the first two.

0142000671|5.0|This classic should not be only read as a high school requirement and forgotten, but read occasionally through out the years, as a<br />reminder that Steinbeck is as powerful now as he was in his day. And that good literature is timeless.
B004DWKO8Y|5.0|I purchased this CD because like most musicians I'm a pretty big Billy Sheehan fan. Having said that I was prepared for a CD that is probably not what the band produced in their hey day. I couldn't have been more wrong. This release is fantastic from start to finish. Not only are the performances fantastic (nobody can question their musical abilities) but the song writing is stellar! If you're a fan of 80's - 90's hard rock with great musicianship this is a must have. If fact this is a must have under any circumstances.

0060512806|3.0|Bought the Cryptonomicon based on recommendation from NPR's top SciFi/Fantasy list.  I'm a fan of the genre and math and history so I thought that this would be a good mix.  The book is, as everyone has mentioned LONG.  That being said, it is very readable.  It gets off to a slow start developing characters but the initial characters are intriguing and written with unique personalities that set them apart from one another.  The story that the book begins following down the trail of, however, quickly gets lost in a web of off-shoots and side stories, concepts and hinted greater back-story.<br /><br />I finished reading it a month ago and had a while to think about it. At first I would have given it 4 stars as a good, fast paced and varied adventure story that only occasionally gets bogged down in crypto too much.  The more I reflected, however, I began thinking:  \\"Yeah, why did he bring in the Eruditium (sp?) group so ominously just to let that thread get lost?\\"  \\"Why did he create the heroine so deliberately just to give her no real character or development?\\" \\"Why did the whole function of the modern day business plan, the crypt, get developed so strongly jut to go nowhere?\\"  \\"Why did he go into detail describing the hacker team just to do nothing at all with them?\\"<br /><br />The list goes on.  I think the author is quite talented, his writing style is good and humorous, if a bit long winded, but he seemed to want to fold so many ideas into one book that only one or two of the story lines actually got followed through.  Would I recommend it?  yeah, if you have a long flight.  Would I bring it to a desert island?  no way.
0345456343|3.0|This omnibus edition, though a bit weighty, is a convenient way to carry the first three books in Rice's Vampire Chronicles series. It is ideal for reading them back-to-back, but it does still contain three separate and complete books:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345409647 Interview with the Vampire (Vampire Chronicles)]]: This is another one of the few books that I was familiar with the movie long before reading the book. In fact, the book has been on my to-read pile because of the movie for quite a long time. And actually, I enjoyed the novel even more than I expected partly due to my great love for the movie. In fact, that was part of what actually led me to finally reading this copy  - I felt like watching the movie and picked up the book instead. I am very glad that I did. Of course, now I want to watch the movie even more, because my memories of the movie seem to line up uncannily well with this version. All in all, this was beautifully written and surprisingly well constructed throughout, keeping the formula of the interview with all the words (almost) in proper dialogue formatting. I definitely can see why Rice is so popular, and why this series is such a giant success. I am looking forward to reading the rest of it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345419642 The Vampire Lestat (Vampire Chronicles)]]: I actually enjoyed this sequel quite a bit - mostly because I grew to like the characters of the first book so much and while they were not all featured here, the material was all new. As much as I didn't care for Lestat in the film version of the first book, he was surprisingly charming here in the sequel. This book had a more immediate feel than [[ASIN:0345409647 Interview with the Vampire (Vampire Chronicles)]] and that added to its strength and entertaining qualities. Rather annoying chapter openers are included here featuring Rice's husband's poetry which did not always seem to be appropriately related. Rice's overly detailed and drawn out writing style is beginning to grate a bit on my nerves and it has become downright frustrating the way she skips over parts that I would like to hear more about while focusing on scenes to such a level of detail that in the end seem rather inconsequential. Still, I did enjoy it quite a bit - more than I thought I would, actually. But, I admit to being a bit less eager to read the third volume in the series.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0345351525 The Queen of the Damned (The Vampire Chronicles, No. 3)]]: I enjoyed this one much more than [[ASIN:0345419642 The Vampire Lestat (Vampire Chronicles)]]. Perhaps because there was a great deal more action, or perhaps because there were more familiar characters from [[ASIN:0345409647 Interview with the Vampire (Vampire Chronicles)]]. The different voices and perspectives throughout were very interesting and I must admit that I enjoyed the others' sections more than the one devoted to Lestat, who I fear is the center of this series. It would be, however, impossible not reading these last two books back-to-back, as they flow together rather seamlessly. And while I am curious as to what happens next (and I do have the next book) I think I need to take a bit of a break from being bogged down in Rice's tedious writing style, as the sections that move slowly absolutely drag on and I don't really have the stamina for that after these three... Someday I will continue, but not until the memory of these books fades and my arm recovers from hefting around this omnibus.it on my nerves and it has become downright frustrating the way she skips over parts that I would like to hear more about while focusing on scenes to such a level of detail that in the end seem rather inconsequential.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book grabbed and held my attention. I read every page and kept going, absorbed, into the end. When I finished I felt relieved. The Maze Runner was a good book, it hummed with energy, it never lapsed into boringness. But I hated the main character. He was weak. And I hate weak characters.
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn was a thought-provoking, dual perspective, mystery with a twist. Numerous reviewers have discussed the plot of the novel, so I will give my overall thoughts.<br /><br />Gone Girl definitely held my interest. From chapter to chapter, especially in the beginning, I kept switching my opinion as to which character was to be believed and trusted. I liked that my opinion kept changing. A story has not done that for me in a very long time.The alternating chapters offered insight based on that character's assessment and the reader had to decide what was real and what was bias.<br /><br />The book was an easy, enjoyable read. In parts, reality must be suspended as to the great lengths gone to in order to ensure retribution for acts deemed unacceptable. I willingly did just that in order to escape inside this story.<br /><br />On the other hand, I wanted to like both of the main characters more, and at the risk of spoiling the ending, I will only say that I wish that there was a better resolution. The author has left the door open for a sequel, but I always prefer to have an unequivocal ending. The evil character deserves punishment and the \\"good\\" or \\"innocent\\" should be redeemed. I was disappointed that it wasn't the case with this novel. However, the book is one that I will remember and highly recommend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Omg this is so fun! It can hold you for hours! Totally fun and addictive! Get it! It seems really easy but it gets harder. And its free!
B00005QW5X|5.0|This is an all time favorite movie of mine.  It has some comedy, lotsa drama, but a good story.  The story does do flashbacks to piece the story together.  Also its a musical, but not your \\"hills are alive with music\\" musical.... we are talking lots of rock and roll and good stuff!  It started out as a live musical in a dive and ended up being made into this feature film. I can't say enough about this movie.  If you are looking for a movie (that may require re-watching to put more of the puzzle together afterwards) and a movie that helps with self identity/reflection. This, is it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|E L James does not disappoint with this trilogy.  Such a great series! Literally couldn't put them down, and was devastated when I finished the books, because they were so good!
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you started to sing/hum along to my reviews title, then you KNOW you need to get a copy of this album. Superb!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I bought this book because I thought the title quite enticing and promising a nuanced, delicately woven story (sorry, some of us do this). To my dismay, here is a teen age fantasy, full of dumm swear words and pulling the voyeuristic, fornicating strings in all of us.<br />It stuck to my fingers like treacle as I was more and more angry with myself for wasting the time and giving in to my base instincts. Hence, I felt manipulated by an author who doesn't care about writing good literature but only what sells. Buy it if you wish to feel the same. If this is the future of publishing, thank the Allmighty for Anna Karenina. I'am going back to that.....
B00003CXIP|5.0|This is a classic movie. I've never seen it before, but it was my boyfriends favorite childhood movie.  So I ordered him a copy as a surprise. Its got a good story and worth having around to make him happy. I re-watch it with him often.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this on my tablet. The puzzles are nicely integrated, challenging but not too much. I really liked the story line, the tight transitions, the set up to the mini puzzles.  All of this becomes a wonderful panoramic seasonal playground with a tap around story line to explore caves, castles, ruins, wells, cabins and sometimes even trees!
0385342063|3.0|I always look forward to a Sophie Kinsella book because I know it will be a light, fun read.  I loved the \\"Shopaholic\\" series and have reread.  So I started this one with a smile and expectations - and I did enoy for the first part of it.  The main girl, as always, was easy to relate to and cheer for: sometimes a wavery self-confidence, sometimes a spunky problem solver. The situations she gets into are both fun and funny.  Eventually I found myself getting bogged down and smile turned into yawn. I was getting confused and bored by the business crisis and the whole situation with Willow felt dragged out and excruciating.  By chapter 12 (about 3/4 through), I had to give it up.  I flipped through the last pages, not really even caring and knowing how it was going to end anyway.  I won't give up on Kinsella; I will try her next book if there is one.  I just won't be buying this particular one for Christmas pressies this year.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This game outshines every other hidden object game on the tablet. The beautiful scenes seem photographed, making the game challenging even with the hints available via moths found along the way. I realized after the first time I was really stuck that this game made me feel much more like a detective than most assemble-it-and-use-it type hidden object games. The puzzles are complex and fun. I think it could have been even harder because of the lateral way the games are hidden,but I'm thankful it wasn't. Honestly will replay this game and I cant say that about nearly every other hidden object game I've ever played. The developers are obviously sophisticated, smart, and understand what this genre could become. I'm thinking about buying all their other games to support FuriousApps!
1468161660|5.0|I literally read this book from start to finish last night. I laughed out loud and then before I knew it I was wiping tears away. I absolutely can not wait for the sequel to come out! Great, great book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|there are a lot of ads in between games but other than that I think it's a good app. The card size is fine on my Kindle fire.
B0086700CM|4.0|the game is very entertaining although sometimes it lags but its a very great game easy for all ages although the characters die thats my only other dislike

B002UXRGM0|5.0|I was thrilled when I saw that the David Attenborough version was on sale, while I can stand it I saw the Oprah version on Discovery not long ago but something about Mr. Attenborough really appeals to me. Great price, great shipping time, picture quality is amazing, overall just an awesome buy.<br />Highly recommend this to anyone who likes documentaries, or nature, along with this:<br />[[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]]]
B0051CSI0G|4.0|Think Zombieland but serious and with elements of the Clint Eastwood-style nameless loner hero. This film is far better than the vast majority of huge-budget Hollywood vampire movies. Stake Land is most surprising for the depth of its characters. It actually takes time to develop them without indulging in the annoying 'revelation round the campfire' style that you see in so many works in the post-apocalyptic genre. The pacing is excellent. The scoring is very good, and so is the cinematography.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Poor Dorothy. She had this fabulous adventure, made incredible new friends, was almost killed by a witch, survived terror and became a hero. But when she gets home to the bare Kansas prairie, no body believes her because the ruby slippers fell off her feet in transit. Plus, she's having trouble sleeping.<br /><br />Poor Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, they don't know what to do. And they have other things to worry about, like building a new house because the old is derelict from tornado damage. Then Henry sees a newspaper advertisement:<br /><br />&quot;ANNOUNCEMENT!<br />Electric Healing!<br />(Weltmer Method.)<br />I take pleasure in saying to the citizens of Black River Falls and adjacent towns and surrounding country that I have secured<br />Dr. J. B. Worley,<br />Graduate American School<br />Electric Healing<br />and have opened a School and Sanitarium of Electric Healing, at my residence, Lower Falls, Town of Brockway, where the afflicted may exchange their aches and pains for ease and comfort.&quot;<br /><br />Em brings Dorothy in, and the proud Dr. Worley tells her, &quot;In just two months it will be the year 1900&quot; - and the electric cure, he assures her, is the very latest thing. In a splendidly constructed scene, totally PG scary, Dorothy is strapped down and about to be subjected to headphones full of electricity, when a thunderstorm knocks the power out. With the help of Ozma of Oz, Dorothy escapes into the rain, chased by the awful Nurse Wilson. Dorothy and Ozma barely escape by jumping into a storm-raging river. When Dorothy wakes up, she's alone with her hen, Bettina, on the edge of the Deadly Desert in the land of Oz. Dorothy knows it's Oz, because Bettina can talk!<br /><br />But what's happened to beautiful Oz? The yellow brick road is all torn up. The inhabitants of the city have been turned to stone - including the Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man! It's up to Dorothy to save Oz.<br /><br />Judy Garland and team are a hard act to follow, but I think this Disney movie does a superb job of bringing Oz to life again. This tale, like the original, has its darker moments. Moments that make it a true fairy tale, for as anyone who's read the original Grimm knows, the road to Happily Ever After is dangerous and dark. The score is great, very evocative music. But there's no singing in this version. (But that WOULD have been an impossible follow-up, wouldn't it?!)<br /><br />As in the original movie, you are given an &quot;out&quot; if you insist on being adult about it. That is, references and people carry over from the &quot;real&quot; world to Oz. For example, glaze-faced attendants push creepy squeaking gurneys through the sanitarium. The same actors play Queen Mombi's Wheelers, the squeaky-wheeled minions who have four wheels instead of hands and feet, and the maniacal laughs that would go with creatures so afflicted.<br /><br />And, speaking of Queen Mombi, she is played by Jean Marsh, the classically trained actress who also brings the evil Queen Bavmorda to life in the 1988 movie &quot;Willow&quot;. Nobody can twist her mouth in rage like Jean Marsh - the perfect bad guy. Not surprisingly, Marsh also plays the sinister Nurse Wilson.<br /><br />I love the special effects in &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. In particular, the claymation of the Gnome King and his talking rocks is fantastic. How you can give shades of meaning to a slab of cliff is wonderfully done.<br /><br />The script does not strictly follow L. Frank Baum's sequels to &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (first published 1900), but the credits say it is based on &quot;The Land of Oz&quot; (probably &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, 2nd book, 1904) and &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; (5th book, 1907). If you haven't read the original books, you might want to give them a try. They are not saccharine, though written for the kid set.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />1. Fairuza Balk Interview. In this 10 minute interview, Fairuza remembers her first movie role, as Dorothy in &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. I was so surprised by her description of the mechanical Tik-Tok, that I had to go back to the movie to watch him in action. He was human powered! A gymnast was inside, upside-down, bent into the round shape, &quot;and he's looking at a little screen on the inside so he can see where he's going!&quot;<br />2. TV Spots. &quot;Return to Oz&quot; is a Disney theater release movie. These are four short commercial spots that probably ran on TV.<br />3. Original Trailer<br /><br />Captions available in English. Dubbing available in French.<br /><br />My high recommendation for this under-rated family movie!<br /><br />Happy Readerole, as Dorothy in &quot;Return to Oz&quot;.

B00634GHJA|5.0|works great. a wonderful, easy way to transfer your pictures to the computer. easy to use. no problems. love it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I just got this book downloaded just before midnigt and am already half way through the book. An excellant read much in the style of Duck Couch and Howard Wasden about their experiences with Team Six. A defiante must read. No wonder the Obama administration didn't want it released, they lied to the public,again!!!
B000FC1AGG|3.0|The thing about Sophie Kinsella is that I could read her grocery list and find it hilarious. Her writing style and sense of humor are just completely on my wavelength, more than most anything else I've read.  She never fails to make me laugh.  So in that regard, I did enjoy the book and can't give it less than three stars.  There were, however, quite a few issues I had with this one so I will just make a bulleted list:<br /><br />* The main character, Emma, spills all of her \\"secrets\\" to a stranger on an airplane during a bout of turbulence. Okay sure, she's scared she's going to die, and she's kind of drunk, but COME ON. The way its written, she appears to be talking to this guy for hours (never mind that it's supposed to be an hour long flight back to London). She doesn't even notice when the turbulence stops, and doesn't even notice when THE PLANE HAS LANDED. Huh? Was there Ecstasy in her vodka? Really, I don't like to have to suspend disbelief that early in a book.<br /><br />*  I'm guessing that Britain doesn't have the same \\"harassment in the workplace\\" policies that they have in the U.S.?? I mean, everybody that Emma works with is just rude and horrible to her, yet she acts like this is the best company to work for ever. What?  After Jack spills all her dumb secrets on television, her coworkers harass her about it relentlessly for days until she hides in the bathroom practically in tears. Um, HR anybody? And then there's the photocopied G-string picture that's up on the office bulletin board, that an employee PROUDLY POINTS OUT TO THE CEO. I don't think that kind of thing has flown in the workplace since 1974.<br /><br />* The big secrets that supposedly ruined Emma's life are idiotic. She pretended to read Great Expectations! She's actually a size 8! She hates jazz! She has a Barbie bedspread! I mean, part of the point of the book is to show that these secrets aren't a big deal and that she should just accept herself the way she is.  But her coworkers harass her about this stuff as if they're in the third grade. Nobody acts like that, I'm sorry. They make joke after joke about \\"read any good books lately?\\" or just make snide, jerky, remarks to her all day. Hey look, I'm back to bullet point #1, also known as \\"What the heck is wrong with these people?\\" It was just too much.<br /><br />*Which leads me to my next point:  Why does Emma never stand up for herself? Tell your coworkers to shut up!  Quit! Call HR! Do something!! It was infuriating. The same thing went for the way her cousin Kerry talked to her. She just hid it away, always lying and pretending everything was great, never telling anybody to shove it. And her roommate Jemima (Jemima? Really?) was a complete psychopath who I didn't find funny at all. Emma's inability to make her call off the tabloid journalist's investigation was just way too over the top (not to mention why she would even be friends with such a person).<br /><br />*  Jack's big secret.  I won't say what it is. But Jack is the equivalent of the CEO of Pepsi. Do you know who the CEO of Pepsi is? Is their family splashed all over the tabloids?  Probably not. So the whole big deal about nobody finding out his late partner's secret was ludicrous. Nobody would care.  He's not a movie star or Prince William....he's not even Steve Jobs. It didn't make sense.<br /><br />*What kind of stupid t.v. interview did Jack do where he's allowed to ramble on for twenty minutes giving away all of Emma's secrets?  It was moronic.  It was just as moronic as Emma telling him all that stuff in the first place.<br /><br />*There were a few inconsistencies in the story that bugged me.  Like at one point Jack says to an employee that he came up with the company slogan \\"Don't Pause\\" in three minutes on a cocktail napkin. Then later on he says that Don't Pause was \\"all Pete,\\" meaning it was his partner's idea.  Huh? And then Emma says she knew Jack was doing a t.v. interview, but later when she's talking to him says \\"You didn't even tell me you were doing a television interview.\\"  Aaahhhh!<br /><br />Long story short...funny book if you are a Kinsella fan, but totally unrealistic and too many nasty characters for my liking.  I also kind of wish that Emma had ended up with the juice bar guy.dn't even tell me you were doing a television interview.\\"  Aaahhhh!<br /><br />Long story short...funny book if you are a Kinsella fan, but totally unrealistic and too many nasty characters for my liking.  I also kind of wish that Emma had ended up with the juice bar guy.

B005LAIHSG|2.0|This was a really boring Thor movie. Oh, wait. It wasn't a Thor movie? That explains why he wasn't using Mjolnir. Go ahead and waste two hours watching this - I did. The best part's of this movie were, of course, the villain. Charlize Theron tried so hard to make her character good n' scary, but the dialogue was too...dumb. But she was still the only interesting character on the screen. The CGI was really good. Actually, the CGI was the best actor in the whole film. I think that they should animate Kristen Stewart's upper lip - because it doesn't do anything.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I love this adaption of Snow White. So much better than Mirror, Mirror, which even for a kiddie movie was horrible.<br /><br />Charlieze plays the best evil queen ever, Even better than Julia Roberts and Sigourney Weaver. I hope she returns for the sequal if one is made at this point.<br /><br />Kristen is quite good in this movie she still is very dpressed in the way she acts but I think more people in the reviews are hating on her due to the Robert pattenson fiasco and not really revieing the acting within this movie. Girls, Rob will be fine im sure : )<br /><br />But if you are looking for an entertaining retelling of a classic get this DVD. I saw it in Theartres and cannot wait to see the special features that it has to offer.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This is a great movie for all audiences. I would think teens would enjoy it the most though. And anyone older of course.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Honestly, the best match 3 game out there! It is highly addictive and just keeps you playing for hours and hours. It really challenging but not that challenging. You know it just keeps your attention. My wife first saw me playing and now it's our favorite game. What makes it so fun is the game play is fluid, the reward system is awesome, and the replay value is trememdous. The over all view is that you have to get a certain amount of points to unlock the next coin. Get all the coins and you win the level which rewards you with a star. You take the star and get these upgrades that make the game that much more fun believe me. It's addictive! They also have these puzzles in between the levels. The could have done some social media things with this but let me tell you it won't bother you that much. However, that would be my only knock just can't take a star away because of that.

B0083GQKQG|1.0|Probably one of the worst movies I ever watched.  The plot was mindless that seemed to be made up as it went along.  Don't waste your time and money on this one.
0385736002|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to get this product, intact, even before the window I was promised...  I am very pleased with the quality of the book and the subsequent shipping...  Would highly recommend....
B0084IG8TM|2.0|A very \\"cheap\\" expensive production of a movie we had to watch in 6th grade called \\"The Lottery\\".  It was about a community of people that started involving people, to increase their prosperity, putting their names in a \\"hat\\" to be drawn to determine who's to die for the others.  A little more action in \\"Hunger Games\\" though, and definitely more \\"hyped\\".  Very disappointing considering the hype this flick got in the media, and certainly the number of copies I see on the discount rack in Safeway.  (Very well charged with SFX for a 2 hour 22 minute flick...oooooh!)  I did like it for the fact that it WAS over 2 hours long.  Not too many shows out there that can make that claim.  You should watch it; it's a great way to waste 2 and a half hours!  Frankly, I am truly amazed at seeing how \\"great\\" other reviewers rated this movie.  Maybe they liked the length of the movie too.  Definitely NOT a \\"Great Movie\\"!  I've seen \\"greater\\" in the discount racks at Walmart!!
0618918248|1.0|Way back in 1976, when I was working on my B.S. in Physics, Professor Zorn, a lovely and talented physicist at the University of Maryland, was asked her view of religion and science.  She gave the answer that to this day I find completely correct, honest, and true: Science is the realm of the observable and religion is the realm of what is not.  I have followed all these God deniers through the years and find not one bit of \\"science\\" in anything they say.  It is a shame that a good scientist will disgrace his name and his work by failing to understand this very simple principle.  Is it ego?  Certainly it is blind faith of a different kind.
034580404X|5.0|I was given the 1st book by a friend and really didn't know what I was in for.  I found that it was an easy read, well structured and definately entertaining. (to say the least)<br /><br />I love to read and this just hit the spot...yep it's a play on words...  I have to say that I didn't really know much about Grey's World but it was interesting.  I found myself not wanting to put the book down and ended up reading the 1st one on a Saturday in about 5 hours....yep I do a lot of reading....  I ended up getting the other 2 books from my friend and read them too.  I believe the first book was the \\"shocker\\" in order to draw fans in...and it did... The 2nd book is almost as entertaining as the 1st.  It's the 3rd book that I found to be different...not sure I'm able to describe it very well.  It almost seemed kind of lame at the end...don't worry, won't give anything away...<br /><br />I am saddened by the quick push to make a movie and from what I've heard angelina jolie has been asking/was asked about being the lead....I think she is a poor choice in that she is so weird and EXTREMELY far removed from virginal status that she wouldn't be able to carry the NOVICE role of Anastasia Steele.<br /><br />In the end, I did enjoy the books and actually ended up buying the 3 set books from Amazon before they trash the covers with the movie stars faces.  I will read them again when I'm looking to \\"refresh\\" my visions of the locked room and it's contents. I would also say that if you are on the conservative or prudish side, these are NOT the books for you.
0763655465|4.0|One glance at George on the cover, and I knew instantly that this was the work of Chris Haughton. I love his big color blocked illustrations, and I recognized that unique font as the same one used in Little Owl Lost.<br /><br />So George the dog has a little bit of a behavior problem. When Harry steps out for a bit, George promises to be good. He wants to be good, he really does - that pink and orange body is stuffed full with good intentions. But how to keep his promise when naughty things keep popping up? What dog can resist a big cake left unattended on the kitchen table? Strike one.<br /><br />George is still standing amidst the cake crumbs when Cat strolls by. A spirited cat chase leaves George panting and staring straight at a planter full of fresh dirt, and boy, does he love to dig around in fresh dirt. Consequently, when Harry returns, the house is a shambles. Cat is hiding, the cake plate is empty and George feels terrible.<br /><br />Harry cleans up, and instead of punishing George, he takes him out for a walk. George IS good on the excursion, bypassing a whole cake, fresh dirt, and Cat. Could it be that this fuchsia dog has finally learned to control his behavior?<br /><br />Although I really do love the illustrations, I wish the storyline had been a tad bit stronger. As it is, I think this would be a good book for younger children, as they would enjoy guessing on each predicament if George will be good or knuckle under to his bad side. Lots of vibrant and and deep colors - bright pink George stands out nicely against white and bold orange backgrounds. My favorite little detail is the uneveness of George eyes - makes him look a bit sad and wonky at the same time.
B0091QS88K|5.0|A Fun Packed App! After trying the free version, I've decided to buy the full version and it was a really good choice.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found this book to be one of the most fascinating and interesting books I have ever read! The book held my attention the entire way through, and I found all the stories contained within to be fascinating! The writing style was smooth and nothing seemed forced. I can't recommend this book enough.

B0084IG8TM|2.0|Loved the movie.  DVD works ok.  A couple of little skips here or there.  My biggest complaint is that this says it comes with a ultraviolet digital copy.  I tried to download the movie in itunes using the code and then through the other way.  Neither worked.  I have no idea who to contact to find out what the deal is with it either.  Annoying.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|Product is of good quality & design; custom-made for securing the Plantronics Pro+.  Be careful about the tension clip.  Expect to lose the case if it is not properly tethered to belt, purse, fanny-pack, etc. Like so many tension clips which are not hook-designed, normal movement will \\"ratchet\\" the case up & away from attached straps.  This  design flaw is, of course, an inherent problem with all pressure clips that don't also \\"hook\\" for additional security.
B007MAET4O|4.0|By far the best sounding of his records, smooth and lovely in every way. I really appreciate John's sensitive stylistic approach. I think he is the most informed of all the young musicians on the charts at the moment. The depth of his musical knowledge is amazing. This is his best record since Continuum, I consider that to be near unapproachable it is his masterwork for sure. I bought the album on iTunes and then discovered it was available on vinyl so i bought that as well, the record sounds so fat, warm and perfect.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie is exceptional. What is not exceptional was how long it took me to recieve it. It took over a week from the time it was released to get to me. In the past when preordering movies I have either received them the day they are released or two to three days later.
0385742886|1.0|I read the Maze Runner trilogy and felt very invested in Theresa and Thomas.  I was excited to read the prequel and find out who the creators were, how WICKED started, how Thomas and Theresa were involved with creating the maze, the glade, all that.  The Kill Order had almost nothing in it about Theresa and Thomas (except the part about the little girl Deedee, who I didn't even realize was little Theresa until I read it in another Amazon review).  The Kill Order was all about a new set of characters that I didn't care about, and I kept waiting for the part with them to end so we could get back to the important stuff about Thomas and Theresa, which never came.  This book didn't answer any of the questions that I had from the first three books and I was very disappointed when I finished it.
B0091QS88K|5.0|I've downloaded it as soon as I received the newsletter that announced its launch! The sounds and animations of the sheep eating are so cute and funny! Kids loves the game and I will get them the full version soon.
B008ENNXQI|1.0|This did not gave a good impression as the hd version is so scaled down and the movie is so dark.

B00007AJGH|4.0|Great video.  I had forgotten what a nice release this movie got on DVD. It is in perfect shape and I received it quickly, with other purchases.  Great box art completed my satisfaction and I was pleased with the price too.  Thanks.
1486144152|2.0|While I adore all things Poirot, this particular publication leaves much to be desired...mostly the essential images.  Literally, images of clues (scribbles on paper, bits of burned documents, maps of the house) that should appear in the reading are absent.  Some do not affect the storyline but others make it impossible to follow the conclusions of the characters because the reader is missing vital information.  Aside from that, the pages look like simple bare internet printouts.  If one cares little for aesthetics in his/her reading experience, this should not pose a problem.  For others (myself included) it is a deterent to a truly enjoyable read.  I suggest anyone seeking an inexpensive version of this book to choose the Barnes and Noble publication.  Also inexpensive, but featuring all the bells and whistles of which Hercule Poirot himself would approve.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This is hilarious! After having one kid and with another on the way I can say that this movie is right on the money. They were somehow able to capture the funny and sometimes disgusting aspects of pregnancy without cheapening the miracle of having a baby. They show Cameron Diaz as the celebrity pregnancy, Jennifer Lopez vying for adoption, Brooklyn Decker as the trophy wife having twins, Anna Kendrick \\"Rosie\\" as the one night stand, and Elizabeth Banks with the super-planned pregnancy. When I first saw the trailer for the movie I laughed until I cried, and now having seen the movie, I am not disappointed. P.S. It's a husband friendly movie - mine sure enjoyed it.
B0086700CM|5.0|very very fun and addicting. I haven't stopped for three days! ha ha ha! I just wish I could slow down the running.
1476712042|1.0|Poorly written with an implausible plot about unappealing, rather low-rent characters, despite the collegiate setting. Lengthy and repetitive. I lost count of how many times the male protagonist beats someone who admired his girlfriend into a bloody pulp, to no one's apparent dismay. For some reason the author believes it is important to document when a main character showers each day.
030758836X|3.0|I loved the first 2/3 of the book but the last third was weak. I wondered if the author had a deadline and just threw together the last part. It was almost like two different people wrote the book. I really enjoyed the authentic sounding male vs female perspectives in the earlier part of the book and the author really knows how to write discriptively. The first 2/3rds of the book were so good that I will purchase another title by this author, even though the last third was a great disappointment. I could think of much better endings than the one the author chose. It really fell flat.

B004LWZWBU|2.0|I've seen plenty of TV used car commercials that were funnier. The plot, if you can call it that, is trite, contrived and boring.
B009329ZF2|1.0|If I can add 2 hours to your life by helping you steer clear of this one, let me help you out. NO REDEEMING features in this movie. Bad acting, incoherent/ridiculous plot & 2 hours of your life you won't get back. I found myself fast forwarding through the first 30 minutes of 'back story' just to find the action in this movie. Just say no. Liam finally made a horrendously terrible film- actually he's barely present in the movie at all. Avoid at all costs.

0385737947|4.0|I had been reading a ton of murder mystery type books and things like that.  Which I do love but I needed a change and something different like the Hunger Games was.  So I typed into Google books like the Hunger Games and this series kept popping up.  Gave it a shot.  Still on the first book but so far so good.
B007SGM084|5.0|Fiffty Shades of Grey Trilogy,<br />  The first couple chapters were informitive, and helped to make you feel familar and friendly while you learned who they were, and understand the trials of being away at colledge and maybe living with a room mate. And how each person brought some of their self in to their appartment.two young college ladies not the same stlye of life, work, ethics, grades, bumbling around the big earth we live in and love on. But now you have to get to know theese Young eagar ladies.Once I got to the third chapter, I knew this book would be in my hand untill it was finished. I ate up the passion, trials and tribulation. With this novel ther was no possable you were going to know what was comming next! Do yourself a little something just for kicks, and pick up the trilogy today. You will love it !! You will be telling your freinds about it and how awsome the story line is<br />  PS you will be smoking !!  Judy

B003UESJHO|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. It is entertaining and funny while still based on a true story. It is not violent but the language is strictly for adults. Lots of f--- type of language.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|So far this novel is most definitely on my best books list! The story told is so beautiful it will make you cry, smile, and even laugh out loud!! I read this book in one da and did not even mean to! For the price of this of this book, are you kidding me? Get it now and you will not be disappointed. The best part is that the story will go on in 2 more books!
031620157X|5.0|My grandson loved this book.  He liked the challenge of reading such a big book for the first time.  He read it in less than a week and said it was the best book he ever read.  Perfect for the extreme summer heat.
B00866JL96|5.0|I read the book, and I agree with other users, the book is better.. But I absolutely love Zac Efron in this movie. His character is phenomenal in that he is plays a role that is so realistic of a soldier with PTSD. I also love his chemistry with Beth and her son Ben. He really shows that someone can be a fatherly role model, even if they are not the child's father.. I love how this movie deals with realistic issues such as love, loss, single parenting, psychological disorders, anger, etc. Love this and recommend everyone see it!
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I installed LastPass on my work and home computer and it works great. When I tried to do the same on my iphone and Kindle, it didn't work so well. The iphone version doesn't autofill the password like the PC version does. It just shows you the password vault as far as I can tell. That's fine if you leave your iphone apps longed in all the time but it defeats the purpose of installing LastPass to begin with. On the PC version, make sure you click the box to delete the existing saved password or you'll end up with multiple passwords and you won't know which one is correct.
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldnt stop reading them. If you can make iy through the first book being explicit, then you will appreciate the story which is real good.
0061537969|5.0|This is really the best book I have ever read.  Hands down, fantastic! You experience every emotion, and it is such an easy read, you will not want to put it down!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy this ap!  It's everything I love about the website! No problems on my kindle fire works great!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book was OK.  It was pretty vanilla to say the least.  While it did answer a few questions, which was nice, there weren't a lot of details in the answers.  I understand why but.....if you are going to do it, I'm assuming the author is PNG'd, do it right.  Mr. \\"Owens\\" is not a professional writer but I didn't expect him to be.<br /><br />Still an ok insight into the whole UBL thing.  I read this in one sitting hoping for more details to come but they never did.  There are other books by Tier 1 guys that shed a ton of light on what they did, more about the training, more detail in the missions etc.  This could've been done the same way.<br /><br />If I had to do it over again I'd still buy the book though.
B008EQIEWS|1.0|I thought that it would be more about the titans.  Instead, it's some suped up love story, with a few graphics thrown in for good measure.  Don't waste your time or money on this one!
B005JABSB6|5.0|These glasses work very well. I was particuarly impressed with thier light weight. They weigh much less than other glasses I have used, which leads to longer term comfort when using them. Highly recommend
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|The first two hundred pages of this novel were grueling for me. I truly struggled to connect with Diana & Matthew in any way other than intellectually. The lack of any empathy on my part towards these characters was an absolute reflection of the dullness of the characters. Diana and Matthew spend the better part of the novel engaged in research & routine in a rather lackluster cat and mouse game. They both lack even the most basic of human social skills leading me at one point to claim that this book is an aspie love story.<br /><br />(In all fairness - I listened to this novel on CD and that could be part of the problem.  While the narrator has received praise from many sources for this work, I found her uninspiring. The book is challenging because there are easily over 10 accents to cover and a multitude of characters. She seemed to have difficulty holding onto the accents and would easily lapse into some vague British tone.)<br /><br />The novel finally picks up the pace towards the end and not coincidentally with the addition of other characters and settings far from the patrician academic halls of Oxford.  True to her own professorial background, Harkness fills the novel with a scholar's love for detailed minutiae.  The novel would have greatly benefited from a broader, more introductory explanation of alchemy - historical  lore & artistry. Instead, Harkness delves into the subject of  alchemy in such a way as to leave me re-reading the same lines over and over in order to better understand a reference, making me feel that I am missing certain necessary information that must have been taught in an earlier class.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches creates a primary lore - that all daemons, witches & vampires may have at one point been related to each other or descended from a common ancestor.  Over the years, each group has avoided intermingling and inter-species (?) relationships were outlawed.  Coincidentally, each group has also faced a diminishment of power and numbers.  When Diana Bishop innocently examines Ashmole 187 (a document that has been completely inaccessible for 100s of years) she is completely unaware that she might be holding the key that explains how these groups evolved and how they  might be restored. Prominent members of each of the groups are subsequently dispatched to ascertain what Diana has learned and gain control of the manuscript.<br /><br />While Harkness has listed various inspirations for writing this novel, she has not directly stated that it was in any way meant to be a veiled political statement regarding prejudice and its role in society. Instead - she is often quoted as stating that she simply wondered if she could write a successful vampire novel.<br /><br />All jokes aside, the novel does pick up the pace in the last third of the book. The scenes revolving Diana's loss of control in discovering her skills; Diana's kidnapping & subsequent torture; and Matthew's research; are all cerebral but more exciting. Admittedly - Diana's relationship with Matthew is comical in so many ways including their academic approach to establishing a relationship  - observe (s/he is attractive); form a hypotheses (I think I love s/he); prove or disprove the thesis and if all else fails apply Occam's Razor to your findings and determine that this must in fact be a relationship.<br /><br />The fact that Matthew & Diana can fall in love, marry & live together as man & wife without ever having consummated their marriage is too much for me to handle.  I immediately wondered if Matthew was gay or in on another plot to retrieve Ashmole 187. But many readers have been willing to suspend disbelief to follow Harkness down this path.<br /><br />Readers will be interested in noting that Harkness has combined quite a bit of scientific history into the novel.  Overall - I found the seond novel in the trilogy, Shadow of Night, to be much more entertaining.<br /><br />[...] and [...]Bishop innocently examines Ashmole 187 (a document that has been completely inaccessible for 100s of years) she is completely unaware that she might be holding the key that explains how these groups evolved and how they  might be restored.

B004U8VUUC|4.0|Wow. This was really great. I rented it without knowing much about the plot but the story was very compelling. Great cinematography and performances. Highly recommended.
B0030B0S2Q|4.0|Great Movie - Excellent Soundtrack I put this with my all time late night sci-fi favorites. On par with Blade Runner, Dune, and Solaris. Quality of soundtrack is on par with the greats i.e. Solaris and Blade Runner. Excellent movie and had to watch a few times to completely get the gist of it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have had no problems as some of the reviews say. The missions give you a reason to keep playing and there are no in app purchases.  You can buy extra coins but I see no point in it. My family plays it enough to collect as many coins as needed to upgrade your guy. Terrific fun!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|it. doesn't work where I live so I deleted it and I hope it works for you. I I live in Fairfield. : l
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is very relaxing as it is addictive.  excellent pass time nonetheless.  I find this game is an excellent place to escape in a room full of people or a world of trouble in a single life.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had lots of twists and turns, and I didn't want to put it down.  Great character and plot development, which keeps you guessing.  I didn't love how the book ended, but the ending was consistent with the characters and their actions and relationship.

B0053TMP24|3.0|On par with the first series. Same great writing and adventure. Some new characters along with ones that you're already familiar with if you read the Percy Jackson series.
0307891372|5.0|My daughter had the game for about four weeks and I asked her how she liked it.  She replied that she loved it but then mentioned that she would like to have the guide.  So after several weeks elapsed and for an early birthday gift (before school started), I presented her a surprise gift.<br />She immediately plowed into it, unfolded the map and explained to me her world of Skyrim. The guide is basically a textbook but well worth every cent.  She says it helps her immensely by explaining the whos, whats, whys and ways of the journey.  Since she received the book, she leveled up several times.  She probably has about 350+ hrs in this game and never seems to be bored.  But now that school is back in session, she tapered off a bit.<br />I wished I had known about the guide book long ago when I first saw the game. I would have bought it then. She loves this game and is especially grateful for the book.  For those of you reading this.....get the book.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Horrible story.  Story was all about an abusive and dysfuntional relationship.  The characters were not engaging, only sad and pathetic.  Had I realized Amazon had a return policy for Kindle books at the time, I would have returned it.  Too late to return now after 7 days.  Do not waste your money on this.  I have no idea how anyone enjoyed this story.
B008N1LL42|3.0|Spoilers!<br /><br />Battleship is a movie that could have been good. Aliens receive a signal sent by Earth and drop in to say hello. Be sure to skip the first 30 pointless minutes of this movie, when they introduce a bunch of shallow characters that barely do anything, a pointless side plot, and play soccer. Anyway, their trip goes wrong when their communications ship slams into a satellite and burns up in the atmosphere (I guess their steering wheel was broken), and they land in the ocean to be greeted by our esteemed US Navy. Unfortunately Earth is the last place they should have visited. This movie is delivered on the surface as a typical alien invasion movie. Under the surface, there is nothing aggressive or dominating about the aliens at all. They try to land near the source of the signal we sent, try to communicate with our Naval ships, and are promptly shot at.<br /><br />What follows is a series of aggression on the part of an incompetent military that shoots first and asks questions later. The aliens, almost reluctantly, destroy our ships and create a giant shield around Hawaii so they can phone home. No doubt to say, \\"Help! These people are nuts!!\\"<br /><br />You spend the entire movie feeling sorry for the poor aliens. Especially when being attacked by a bunch of military misfits. A confused young man who cries at his post because he doesn't know what to do during battle. A slacker who somehow manages to end up in command of his own ship, and then promptly orders them to ram the aliens and kill everyone. They are saved of course by a Japanese commander and a bunch of 80 year old retired naval officers who are the only ones in this movie who seem to know what they are doing. Why the Navy thought this was a good movie to support, I have no idea.<br /><br />Throughout the film, the aliens do everything they can to protect themselves and avoid killing the natives. They go out of their way to rescue one of their own without hurting anyone else. They risk boarding the ship to disable it rather than destroy it, which they could have easily done. Their weapons are primitive and ineffective for a interstellar travelers. The mechanical suits they wear don't have any weapons at all. At the end of the movie, the aliens are destroyed and our protagonists all get medals. I really feel like this was a different movie that was gutted in the editing room and changed with a slap-on new ending. At least at the end of Independence Day, you felt like the aliens deserved it. At the end of this movie, I felt like we just killed a stray puppy and paraded it's dead body down Main Street.<br /><br />Oh, and just to justify the name of the movie, there's a scene where they blindly lob shells at each other on a Battleship grid. Because of course, an advanced interstellar traveling spacecraft would have no way of seeing a giant 500ft steel boat in the dark.ding the ship to disable it rather than destroy it, which they could have easily done.

B006H3MIV8|4.0|I've had this in my multi-disc changer for a few months. About every weekend I'll put it on random and do yard work outside.  Most of the time I like what I hear, sometimes even saying, \\"that's REALLY good...who is that?\\" It takes quite a few listens and the styles are SO different. Really surprised to like the Maroon 5 version, quite good. Only one song I do like...Dave Matthews live version..a bit obnoxious. But I do like Dave's politics.
030758836X|4.0|After all the hype I expected this book to make me younger, taller and thinner. I expected to hate it. I wanted to hate it. But guess what,I did almost nothing else the day I finished the book because I HAD to get back to it. That's saying something. Many people have taken issue with the ending and it did get a little out there, but I suspend my disbelief on a regular basis - 85-90% of this book was a cracking good story. So good, I would have been proud to have written it. ;-)
B009329ZF2|4.0|I'm not a fan of cheap, cheesy science fiction.  That said, I think this movie was highly underrated.  The comments of it being a Transformer ripoff are unfounded.  No giant robots walking around blowing things up.  Other than turning a museum into a functioning warship that quick the plot was believable in the realm of good science fiction.  I know it won't happen but I'd like to see a sequel

B005K0HDGE|1.0|I didn't read any of the book's reviews, so I had fairly high expectations.  I was wrong.  If Stephen King is moving in a new direction of writing, I suggest he stick with the macabre.  I trudged through most of the book only to be disappointed in the end.  In the future, I will rely less on the author's celebrity and more on book reviews.

B001HN6EF4|5.0|we picked this up at a local store while on vacation and spent 2 hours playing it for the first time for the kids on a ferry ride.<br /><br />Our 5 and 7 year olds had no problem using the plastic cards. They were a bit thin for picking up from the table, but the material and the hook was great for travel. Only wishes that the instructions were also printed on the same plastic film as the cards rather than the plain paper as it doesn't store well.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I had not watched the series on HBO yet and could not stop reading the books. Then I watched the series. Each book got me involved in characters, wanting to know what would they do next and who would win the next battle. Definitely well written, good visuals and descriptions.
0525953728|5.0|It looks interesting and I suggest everyone order it now.  I haven't read it, but you know they are going to do their best to block it, so it could be now or never.  I'm old enough to remember the controversy over \\"The Pentagon Papers,\\" and while they weren't able to block it then, it's a different Supreme Court with different ideas now.  I'm tempted to order about 10 copies so I'll have a collector's item to re-sell if it gets blocked!
B004QO9WVO|2.0|If you want this for only the written book, great.  But if you want to get the audio book, as I did on a trip recently, note that you must receive the audio files in a zipped format, and then unzip them before they can be put on a smart phone to be listened to as you travel.  I bought this before starting out on a trip, and then when I tried to start to listen to the audio part during my trip, I found out it is not available without going to my computer and unzipping the files and then putting them on my phone.<br /><br />Bottom line:  long trip, no audiobook.
0307352145|2.0|My problems with the book include the boring sections where you are told how to raise an introverted child and be accepting of him/her.  Good advice, but it should be in another book for parents.  I am just not interested in child raising issues.<br />  There is a little too much, us versus them.  As in introverts versus extroverts and how introverts are oppressed and how they can rise up and conquer the extroverts and their dominance.  That is not going to happen.  Extroverts won't notice the revolution, sorry to say.  I think introverts can be just as deluded about the world as extroverts, they just don't speak up.  I will bet there were plenty of introverts hoping for big payoffs during the financial bubble.  Just remember the bankers hired physicists to crunch numbers for them.  Physicists seems like an introverted group if there ever is one.<br />  Obviously, the book is meant to encourage introverts and make them see that the temperament they have is actually as good as or even better than extroverts.  That is good self help style, but misses the reality of being introverted.  Introversion was obviously selected for during evolution but like a lot of selected traits, it is better not to have them expressed all the time.  I do not think there is one extrovert who would want to be introverted.  Not one.  They get the sex, money and status.  They have lower levels of depression and are overall happier.  End of story.<br />  The author wants introverts to be happy with themselves the way they are.  This is all fine and good, yet introverts spend a lot of their lives dying a thousand deaths in social situations.  Even when they \\"act\\" extroverted, they need hours later to calm down.  Self acceptance is a worthy goal , but being so happy is absurd.  It is more realistic to advocate understanding not happy-faced illusion.  Introverts may be capable of weathering the storm of life but they are not happy.<br />  Finally, the author mentioned Arthur Schopenhauer, the pessimist thinker who said life is boredom and pain.  She should have stayed with his pessimism more in this book.  Introversion encompasses more boredom and pain than extroversion.  The book should have delved more into this.
0788859544|5.0|I have been searching stores for this movie and couldnt find it anywhere. So I looked on Amazon and found it.  This movie is super.  One of the best Disney movies.  My grandchildren love to watch it, the music is awesome.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|I don't get it...<br /><br />I came across Wool omnibus on Amazon and was captivated by the statistics - close to 1700<br />reviews and almost 1500 of them are 5 stars, less than 25 are under three.  Reviews contained words like<br />\\"classic\\", comparisons to Asimov and Herbert, Simmons and King.  So I read it...<br /><br />... and was left with this impression: a well-written, interesting book, with little to explain such exulted<br />response. Is it merely a case of a great value - above-expected quality for under $6?  Is it the overall<br />quality of today's sci-fi or mainstream storytelling that makes Wool seem such a standout?  Is it something<br />else?  I do not know, perhaps someone will enlighten me.<br /><br />Meanwhile, reading Wool and its reviews got me thinking - what makes a 5 star book?  What's the threshold for 1 star? 3 star?<br />After some consideration, here is my explanation of why I gave Wool 3.5 points out of 5:<br /><br />1. Quality of writing, style: In this age of self-publishing, at a bare minimum,<br />writing should be free of technical errors. For full credit, story must be well-written - with great language use,<br />a nice flow and pace, natural dialogue, i.e. be well-edited.  Nothing should get in the way of enjoying the story and<br />its characters. It's a little subjective, but if you are reading and find yourself thinking about such things,<br />chances are you are distracted because some of the above-mentioned qualities are missing.<br /><br />In my opinion, Wool meets all of the above criteria: well-written, well-paced, engaging style.<br />+1 point<br /><br />2. Plot and Narrative: the next level of quality requires an interesting story that makes you care what's on<br />the next page, makes you want to get to the end. Well-managed plot-lines and transitions between them are<br />important.  So is the internally-consistent narrative that holds your attention throughout.  By internally-<br />consistent I mean true to the story's internal laws/settings/universe, without \\"Hey, wait a second there...\\" moments.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading Wool beginning to end. It can be immersive. I could see why the first story made people<br />want to know more about the world of the Silos.  I found interesting the internal workings of the silos -<br />well-thought out and described, but without getting so absorbed in explaining everything to detract from the<br />story's pace. There were plot points that were unexpected and propelled the stories by opening up new<br />possible directions to unfold.<br />+1 point<br /><br />3. Characters: do you care about the characters? Do you love them, hate them, empathize with them, get annoyed with<br />them, or do they leave you indifferent?  Do they are appear alive, as someone you'd be interested to know in<br />real life?  If they die, do you feel anything?<br /><br />Wool main guys are mostly well-developed, with sufficient shades of grey to make them less predictable and<br />one-dimensional.  I wish they had a bit more wit and humor about them - I can't remember a single joke or<br />even a quip - but that's a personal preference.  I also wish some characters with major plot impacts were<br />better developed. For example,  the sheriff in Book 5 - his decision/actions near the end prompted a<br />\\"Bull****\\" - it did not ring true and was, in my opinion, unfounded, as if the author was scrambling to wrap<br />it all up and conjured up something convenient. Still, overall, there are enough reasons to give full credit.<br />+1 point.<br /><br />4. Originality and excellence: is the story original, surprising, unconventional, or a well above-<br />average representative of a particular genre?<br /><br />Wool is a very good example of universe-building sci-fi, of the post-apocalyptic / utopian variety.  The Silo<br />universe is quite robust, well-thought out, with much detail - enough to plausibly suspend disbelief.<br />There are still open questions about thesetup of the Silos, on a more global scale, but I assume<br />there are more Wool installments to come to provide answers.  That said, to me, the Wool universe felt a bit<br />derivative, reminiscent of \\"We\\", \\"Brave New World\\", or \\"Anthem\\". In other words, good representative of a<br />genre, but not hugely original.<br />+0.5 points<br /><br />5. Lasting impact<br />Someone said that science fiction is the last refuge of philosophers.  I mentioned \\"We\\" and \\"Brave<br />New World\\" - they were about something more than the utopian universes constructed within them.  Those were<br />merely the media for talking about ideas, things that had relevance in the real world of the their day or<br />near future. Foundation and Robot series was an exploration of the forces of history, the forces that drive<br />human development, wrapped into murder mysteries and space opera. Atlas Shrugged was a manifesto for a whole<br />philosophy.  Great books leave you thinking about them long after you are done.  Timeless books are those relevant<br />when written and are relevant still, which is why we keep coming back to them, re-reading them over and over.<br />I read \\"We\\" over 20 years ago, and its themes are still here with me.  Written in 1921, it is still as relevant as ever.<br />That's what makes it a classic.<br /><br />Great fiction can also leave an emotional imprint, sometimes on a visceral level.  My personal example is<br />\\"Consider Phlebas\\" by Iain Banks.  I read it over 7 years ago, but I still remember how it made me feel - it's<br />just something that stays with you. And if a book can get to you on both levels, intellectually and emotionally,<br />then it's more than a book, it's a cherished experience.<br /><br />None of this, to me, describes Wool, despite its undeniable merits. What is Wool about, beyond its particular characters<br />and chains of events?  Is it exploring any themes? Does it have some relevance, meaning outside of itself? I did not see it.<br />And there is nothing wrong with its absence - sometimes being entertained in a moment is plenty.<br />However, it's greatness and timelessness that's under consideration.<br />0 points.<br /><br />I recognize the last 2 criteria of my scale are more subjective and therefore leave lots of room for debate.<br />But... isn't that the best part of Reading?
B008O69SZ0|4.0|Ian Hunter  \\"When I'm President\\"  (2012).<br /><br />This  album  rocks from the get go.  Ian is 73 years-old and he out rocks people at 23, it's going to be a sad day when rock loses this guy.  This album rocks with \\"Comfortable (Flying Scottsman)\\", The title track, \\"What For\\",  \\"Wild Bunch\\" has a 50's vibe to it, \\"Saint\\" with some great keyboard work by Andy Burton  \\"I Don't Know What You Want\\", Ta Shunka Witco (Crazy Horse)\\" great lyrics.  His slower songs are just as good, \\"the raspy  \\"Totally Flawed\\", \\"Black Tears\\", and the classic \\"Life\\".  Great guitar by Andy York!  Ian Hunter continues to write strong lyrics after 43 years.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Wow! I bought this book not expecting an awful lot for my $2.99 but it absolutely blew me away! I LOVED this book. Great character development with an intriguing and fast-paced plot meant that I found it difficult to put this book down. A few typo's but nothing major that you couldn't easily figure out. I would have paid a lot more than $3 for this book. If you're not sold on the rating then try the sample, I bet you come back for more. Can't wait for the next book! =)
034580404X|5.0|Hard to put down series of novels, very interesting and fun to read. Wish they continued with another book on how things turn out.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|This was a great movie. The plot involves some young teens who go on an a mysterious and amazing adventure. There are also quite a few bits of humor in the film for both adults and kids. There is also plenty of action.<br /><br />This movie is rated PG-13, which surprises me, mainly because of the language. Apparently the word sh*t is not a profanity anymore. Just be aware of this if watching this with your kids. Other than that word being used repeatedly, it is completely fine for family movie night.<br /><br />This movie really reminded me of the Goonies movie from the 1980's, except instead of a pirate theme Super 8 is centered around, well, I don't want to give it away and ruin it. You'll have to go see it for yourself. 5 stars!
0425263908|5.0|Great book hard to put down. Cant wait for the next two to come out.  Was very life like and real. I would recommend this book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just can't get enough of this great mind candy! I just love a book that gets you so into the characters that you yell at your Kindle (or paper copy) because they do something you don't agree with. But at the end of it all, with the trilogy read, I still think the whole series was a great read, and if there is a fourth book, you can bet this reader is gonna be first in line to buy it! I read the series in 5 days. Just couldn't put it down! Another observation though, if people hate the first book and really hated the second, why did they read the third?? Still just curious.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a fantastic tale of adventure and a poignant commentary on the triumph and tribulations of human life.  Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I originally started reading this book because of all the controversy surrounding it. I heard libraries were banning it, it was dirty, immoral, ect. Tell me I shouldn't read something and I will. I was a little nervous that I was going to spend 10 bucks on something that I hated. Thank goodness that wasn't the case. Half way through this book I bought the other two straight away. It it a fantasic book and total mind candy. After a day taking care of my family then working afternoons and evenings taking care of people in a group home, when I finally get some time to myself, this is exactly the kind of book I want to read. It is total escape. It, in it's own way, is even thought provoking at times, but still total fantasy. I will admit that it is not this century's (or last century's or any century's) great literary work. But it did make me laugh. Again and again. It made me care about the characters. Yes, I rolled my eyes at the repetitive dialoge after awhile, but it wasn't enough to make me stop reading and stop wanting to know what happened to these characters. When I read a book, I don't always need to learn a moral lesson or any other for that matter. If I want great literary works I'll read the Grapes of Wrath or the Great Gatsby. Moby Dick or whatever. When I want a book that will let me escape from my crazy life for awhile so I don't go insane, I'll read something like this. Perfect, even if repetative, fantasy.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|However, still watchable. I'm gonna make this kinda short and say that the main problem I had with this movie was that there was a lot of talking and explaining stuff (lots of these superhero movies are so serious at times lately!) and NOT ENOUGH ACTION. Where was it? Sure there is a pretty girl at Captain America's side and for anyone who cares, Captain America is played by the hottie Chris Evans who is seen shirtless a few times so there's that part of it. But to me there just wasn't enough fighting and fast-paced things going on in this mostly slower-moving movie. The action that did take place was fine and the scene where he is trying to escape a place that will soon explode with a friend was very gripping and kept my attention, but honestly there wasn't that much to work with here. I don't wanna step on any toes here when I say this, but I'd take any of the first 3 Spiderman movies over this one (oversensitive Pete and all). I liked those movies anyway.<br /><br />3.5 stars.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After waking my husband up screaming \\"OMG!!! She actually left him!!\\" at 2:00 in the morning while finshing the first book, I immediately started this one. I couldn't wait for these two to get back together to see what antics (not just in the bedroom) they would get into next. The plot thickens, so to speak in this installment, and yes the dialoge is repetative again, but it is still lovely, naughty and heartwrenching, at times, mind candy. Perfect escape for me after a long day, and as I said in my review of the first book, sometimes that's all I want in a book, fantasic fluff! Just an observation though, if people hated the first one so much, why did they read the second one? Just curious.
B0045HAF22|1.0|One thing I don't get is, since Peter is so observant, why doesn't he see that this Olivia still has darker eyes?  That's just one problem I have with season 3.  It's really just a drudgery to watch, compared to seasons 1 and 2.  I hope season 4 and 5 are better.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is so far advanced from the little monitor in the corner of my kindle as to make me embarrassed for Amazon.
B0044CG71G|1.0|I was really looking forward to season 3, but it's disappointing, to say the least.  I wish they hadn't dragged on the story line about the other universe for so long.  Seems to me the writers are stagnant.  Major Bummer.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Excellent sound machine with multiple layers of sounds.  Works even after the Kindle turns off.  Great selections of sound...I love the rainshowers with thunder and wind.
B004AUGOGU|1.0|Fringe started out a bit slow in season 1 but found its voice quickly.  The rest of season 1 was good, and season 2 was great.  Season 3 is a major let down.  I'll watch the first few episodes of season 4, but if it gets no better, I won't keep trying.  I watched the entire 3rd season and was really disappointed.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|had this app a week and love how precise it is. best one I've  found by far. makes it easy to track where battery life is going.
B004NHFOFM|1.0|I guess the one good thing I can say about season 3 is, now it makes sense why Walter wanted Belly to remove pieces of his brain.  I don't like Walternate, and my guess is that he didn't like himself, either.  I miss Walter on these alternate episodes, and I hope season 4 will be back to normal.  I also miss Olivia.. I don't like Fauxlivia at all.<br /><br />Well at least there is a line Walternate won't cross.  But things are just too predictable and boring.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|The splashtop remote dasktop is easier to install and use on both desktop and andriod device than using most other remote programs.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|so glad I installed app. I have used it daily since downloading. highly recommended to any who have a kindle fire.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app is coo coo cool at maintaining mini notes throughout the day or for organizing ones semester courses into a journal with a pretty User interface.
B00005S6K6|4.0|2 great actors - a good story - makes it a good movie. There are a few holes in the story nevertheless worth taking the time to watch with a good friend.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|I would love to review the video, but it never downloaded AND WE WERE CHARGED FOR IT.  That's right.  I saw the film in the theater, but when I tried to share it with my husband, the attempt was a total failure.  No movie, but charged anyway.
1475143389|5.0|OK, i bought this book after being in a military school for 7 months and loosing 23 pounds in the process. lets start from the beginning. as i was reading the book i notice a few things right from the start. 1, its very easy to read. there no big scientific words that i can care less about. the author breaks everything down to the level of an amateur and makes it fun and interesting. i am not a fast reader but was able to finish everything in about 2 days. everything is broken down from reps, weight, proper movements and so on. the nutrition portion is just as good. i think the best part is the free stuff you get at the end of the book. after i sign up for the free guide, the author got in contact with me by email and was willing to answer any questions i had about the book and the new workout program. overall i think this is one of the  few no BS books and programs out there. i would recommended for anyone from beginners to advance weight lifters.

B000QUCNP4|5.0|This was a fantastic movie with an incredible cast that recaptured the joy of the 1960s. It was like going back in time to the days of yesteryear! A time without international terrorism and a time where we were on the right track in America! Yes, there was Vietnam and the cruelty of the American South, but San-Francisco represented what was progressive in America. The Zodiac changed that and San Francisco would never be the same again.<br /><br />Mark Rufalo and Jake Gyllenhall and Robert Downey, Jr. were awesome! The director, Fincher handles his cast and crew perfectly and had a deft cinematic touch with. I loved the subtle allusions to today vs yesterday. \\"We don't have a telefax yet...\\" Then there were the ubiquitous pay phones of the 1960s-1970s. Devices I wish would make a comeback in the 21st century. Allusions to Dirty Harry and seeing the Transamerica building go up were marvels of American cinema. Let's not forget the slinky commercial!! Wow! I've seen that commercial before and it is hilarious!<br /><br />The killer, whoever he was, was a savage man. When Paul Stine was shot in the head, the call went out that a black man had committed the crime. The stupidity of Officer Dan Fouke (Shown, But Not Named In The Film) allowed the killer to escape. This point is hammered home in a powerful scene where Rufalo just stares at the poor policing of the two uniformed cops. While not directly mentioned, the subtle racism of the cops is an underlying current of the scene. They were so concerned about \\"getting a black man\\" that they let the murdurer walk right by them. \\"He was shuffling along,\\" Houk says. \\"Did you even question him?\\" \\"No,\\" Houk shakes his head. The thought never occured to Houk that night that there may have been two men involved in the crime, or that the initial report was wrong. His lack of imagination and two diomensional thinking, and yes, perhaps racism, ended up allowing the killer to escape and taunt the police again and again.<br /><br />I sawthe movie three days ago and have yet to see any of the special features, but when I do they will be the icing on this cake. Buy this dVD and you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />  A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
0553801473|3.0|It seems that the longer a book takes to come out with G.R.R.M. the worse it is.  I would rate DWD as the worst of the series.  I am still a huge fan of this series, but I am REALLY expecting something from book six to keep me hooked (Whenever it comes out, if my great-grandchildren are still alive by then.)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|RIVETING STORY...HOOKED ME FROM THE BEGINNING STARTING WITH THE HELICOPTER COMPLICATIONS. I ESPECIALLY ENJOYED HIS PATH TOWARD THIS EXCLUSIVE AND ELITE TEAM .

0345528581|5.0|I've been lifting weights for 27 years and thought it was a must in order to stay in shape.  I was so wrong.  I'm not knocking weights, but since I started using this routine all my pains, tendinitis and other issues have gone away.  No longer have aching joints, the pains in my shoulder and back are gone.<br /><br />Sure, I can no longer bench 250, but who needs to at age 44.  I have more balance, legs are stronger and it's even increased my running and biking distance.  I haven't felt this good since my teenage years.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book, but you have to use the app to be successful.  At least that's the case for me.  It's something about following his routine and not failing.  Really motivated me and I'm now on week 10 of the routine and have doubled, sometimes tripled the number of reps Mark recommends.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I didn't know what to expect at first but once I saw the first episode I was hooked.Claire Danes was tremendous and Damian Lewis also tremendous.This show really is exciting and riveting.Catches you up by surprise every episode.Really recommend this show which is like the best shows on T.V right now.
B0068FYZCA|4.0|The movie is a classic and it is one of my favorites. The movie by itself merits a 5 star ratting unfortunately due to the Audio my rating drops to 3.5 stars. The Blu-Ray disc does have better video quality than the original DVD release. What I don't understand is how could Universal do a re-release on Blu-Ray and not re-master that fabulous sound track in 5.1 DTS HD Master audio. They took the easy way and did a 2.0 transfer. The soundtrack to me is one of the most important parts of this movie but on the Blu-ray version it is below par. So my average overall rating for the Blu-ray release is 4 stars.
B00687PWQG|4.0|Good acting.  Good cinematography.  Good story line.  However, because the series spans several decades, the depth of the subject matter is not explored in any detail.  This left me to dwell on my own understanding of the revolution, etc. to fill in some of the motivations of the characters, etc.  But, the overall look, feel and quality of the production was well worth the viewing.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun game,  highly addicting. huge fan of ice age great pictures. some problems with pixals but other then that runs smooth.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So glad there is finally an app! Works much better than going online on my Kindle Fire to Pinterest website. 5 STARS*****
B002RI9S2Y|3.0|Although most of the story seems like a complete copy of the immortal Harry Potter series, the plot and the concept are quite interesting due to the fact that the author has made the blend of Greek Mythology with modern in an awesome way... making it sound almost real...! A fantastic read with only a few drawbacks which, well, can be ignored!
B005USZYDU|5.0|As always Grisham is great.  Had to keep reading until I finished, now have to get the other Theodore Boone books!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great acting by the five men with good music and s moving story.  There were tears flowing when his little girl was killed.  There were tears flowing again when he reached out to his friends and to his son.  The story is every family's story.  Our children depend on us to make decisions that will guide them into their adulthood with the training and love they need for happy and fulfilled lives.  We depend on God to help us overcome the evil temptations of life and give our children an example to live by.<br /><br />By dedicating their lives to God, these men soon learned that all is not easy when making a resolution to do good.  It was with a very heavy heart that they had to turn away from one of their own brothers in the Sheriff's department.  But the resolve to do the right thing was the catalyst that brought them closer to each other and to their own families.<br /><br />I am so proud that I saw this movie.  It was a huge surprise to me.  I never saw it advertised nor did I even know it existed.  I just happened onto it while searching for something to watch on a Sunday afternoon.  It should be shown to all parents and their children.  It is life changing.
0307592839|5.0|I'm the second-to-last person in my family to read this book. I'm not a fast reader and it took me just a few days, but I liked re-reading chapters as I went along. The details really command your attention. It spans over a bunch of recent decades and takes place all over the world, so it was fun to talk about with my parents and siblings. If you aren't interested in the music industry or characters that make human choices: This book isn't for you. Now I have to get my other sibling to read it!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love these types of games that really exercise your logical thinking. It is well worth the $4.95. I am in heaven. If you like sudoko or ken ken types of games, you should love this. fyi - I rarely review unless I think a game or app is exceptional.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this app so easy to use a must have. a really great app and really great graphics definately would recommend
B007SGM084|4.0|These books kept you wanting to read more and more to discover all the under lying plots that were accoring.
030758836X|3.0|Slow the first half and picked up the second half.  Content a little more interesting and moved steadier the second half. I found it hard to really care about the characters.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|AWESOME book detailing very interesting events. Thank God for all Special Operators!!!! I couldn't stop reading it & finished it the day it released via kindle. Thank you Mark Owen & all Special Operators!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that there are many versions available. It is easy to navigate to the verses you want to read. You can also listen to the passages you select. There are devotionals available from Joyce Meyer, etc. I am very happy with this app.
B008MM9630|5.0|lots. of fun to play. easy way to pass a long day or a sleepless night. I enjoy it and hope you will too!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very good read.  A study of a parent's unconditional love for her/his child.and the conflicts that arise when reality challenges that unconditionallity.
B008CP93S0|2.0|This movie doesn't have much going for it beyond the great cast. I'm a big fan of Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston, but this movie just plodded along. The jokes were contrived and there was nothing really driving the plot forward. A lot of the characters were pretty horrible. There's a long scene where Paul Rudd is saying foul things into a mirror that just went on forever, and was not funny.  I'd skip this one unless you are a die hard fan.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|A friend convinced me to watch the show and I became hooked. Like a lot of others, the 10th doctor is my favorite and I really wanted a sonic screwdriver of my own, so when I saw this one I just couldn't pass it up.<br /><br />The toy is plastic, but despite that is an almost exact replica of the one used in the show. It is sturdy for the most part. The sound and light is great.<br /><br />I only have two small complaints. The first is that the pen nubs very easily come off. I put it in my pocket or my bag, and next time I go to pull it out, the pen part has come off. The same goes for the switch that extends the top part out. It is made to take off so you can reach the screw underneath in order to take it apart and put the batters in, it just snaps on and off, but I find it comes off pretty easily.<br /><br />Secondly is that it is plastic. For the price, I feel that at least the silver parts should have been metal. One of the iconic sounds aside from the buzzing that comes with the light is the little metal clinks every time the doctor extends it or flips it or stows it back in his pocket, and so I tend to find the plastic kind of lacking. Unfortunately, metal replicas are extremely expensive.<br /><br />Now, if the price were a bit less, $10 or $15 instead of over $20 then the plastic wouldn't bother me so much. Not counting that, it is still an excellent toy, well made, and looks great. (Though I think it might be a bit bigger than the one in the show). I don't regret buying it, and would recommend it to any fans of the show. But if you're a collector and really want an impressive replica, I'd consider some of the more expensive ones (not found on amazon unfortunately.)
0525953728|5.0|NAVY SEAL, Mark Owen delivers an inspiring, captivating story with the highest respect and honor for our military. His own story is not just about the raid and death of Osama Bin Laden, but about countless missions from one of the most memorable special operations in history. For the first time ever, the author gives his personal account of the planning and execution of the Bin Laden raid, who confronted the terrorist and witnessed his death, without revealing secrets in this book. A part of history is told as readers are taken to the battlefield in America's ongoing war on terror as the selection and training process is detailed for one of the most elite units in the military. \\"NO EASY DAY\\" portrays dedicated and well-disciplined characters, and their persistence and devotion in the highest level of military training. In addition, Mark Owen draws a portrait on struggle and defeat, and encourages others to follow their dreams. This captivating story is intense, heartfelt, powerful moving, and insightful. Highly Recommended for all those who enjoy inspirational memoirs, and stories about heroism and the military. A brilliant story that marks history as it tugs at the heart!
1439170916|3.0|The book is well written but at 550 pages is too long for the average reader.  This book is a must read I think for future oncologists.  It contains interesting anecdotes and stories about the history and treatment of cancers.  It focuses primarily on the development of chemo therapies.  There could be more discussion about the brutal trade off many cancer patients with certain solid tumors must make.  Being brought to near death in exchange for a few months of low quality life.<br /><br />It is interesting and frustrating to note that in the mid 1960's, a total cure for cancer through chemo therapy was seen by many to be a sure thing.
B000P0J024|5.0|Pure entertainment from 5 of the best, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne(ELO).  It's ashame the accidential group no longer exists.  It was magic.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I wanna mention that my experience with DACs is has been with:<br /><br />Fiio E7 (USB DAC+Headphone AMP)<br />Fiio D3 (SPDIF DAC)<br />Fiio E17 (SPDIF and USB DAC + Headphone Amp)<br />Audio-GD NFB5 (higher end USB and SPDIF DAC+Headphone Amp<br /><br />I wanna mention that the weakest DAC was definitely the E7, which sounds slightly veiled in comparison to the others. As for the other 3... they were so close in performance to one another in my ears, that it's basically told me that once a DAC is 'good enough', money is better spent elsewhere. If the D3's internal DAC is considerably worse than the one on my NFB5 which I spent $430 total on, well, I surely couldn't hear it. I have good enough ears to hear differences in the amps I have owned (E5, E7, E17, E9, Schiit Lyr, Audio-GD NFB5), which definitely had more differences than the DACs.<br /><br />So all in all, what I'm saying, is that if you need a great sounding SPDIF DAC, the slightly over $21 Fiio D3 is just worth a purchase even if just out of mere curiosity. You obviously need to understand that it will only work with the correct format (stereo PCM signals), or you'll get nothing but distortion (so no Dolby Digital, DTS signals, kiddies!).<br /><br />If you need a DAC for headphones, and aren't affected by expectation bias (as in expecting things that cost a lot more to be better, therefore tricking yourself into thinking the more expensive item MUST be better), you'll see that the D3 is a very good DAC.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's better or worse than the others. What I AM saying is that the differences are so negligible, you'd have to literally sit there for days on end to say which one is better than the other. For the major population, this is surely enough.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I Bought this product to use as an external microphone with my GoPro Hero 2.  I mounted it in the trunk of my car to record exhaust noise while driving my car at the track because the GoPro's built in mic picked up a lot of wind noise(when mounted outside) and was very boomy(when mounted inside).  This mic performs as well as can be expected for a $20 lav mic.  The sound quality is quite good, although not as much depth as a higher end microphone.  When used with the GoPro it does record sound on both channels(same sound for left and right) and the volume is only slightly lower than the volume from the internal microphone.  I also liked that this microphone had an exceptionally long cord(15-20 feet) which made it well suited for me to place the mic close to the sound I want to record, and not necessarily near the camera.  If you're looking for a small mic and you aren't terribly picky about sound quality then I'd highly recommend this product.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Had been looking for this game. Makes you think. Addictive and fun! So glad it is here for the Kindle.
B008GX2YQQ|3.0|I agree with the other reviewer who felt that Centipede Hz is a tough album to assign a star rating.<br /><br />Is it a good album? Definitely.<br />A great one? Actually enjoyable to listen to? See, there, it gets complicated...<br /><br />This is the third album of what I consider to be Animal Collective's 3rd stage: the move from fractured yet melodic post-rave psychedelia into something bigger, louder, and more conventionally structured. Not exactly accessible or mainstream, more like a big-budget project that's not afraid to be creative and ambitious. If \\"Feels\\" was their \\"Memento,\\" \\"Centipede Hz\\" would be \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\"<br /><br />And much like that third Batman blockbuster, this album is a full-scale assault on your nervous system. It is simultaneously the cheeriest and the darkest of their releases, ringing in your ears like the demented cackle of a bipolar clown in full manic mode. The production here is impressive, boasting a clear and full sound that's just bursting with strange details at every corner. This no-hold-barred-approach to the album's production is so overwhelming, the conventional structures of the songs actually serve as welcome anchors, guiding listeners, upon repeated plays, through the chaos.<br /><br />Even upon first listen, the opening two songs perfectly showcase the success of this approach. Two massive bodies of rhythm and melody that just leave you struck with awe at their command over your senses. There's a giddy pleasure to be had here, like thrilling to the speed and peaks of an enormous new rollercoaster. It's novelty, uncertainty, some pure terror, and pure delight.<br /><br />But after a while, (much like Dark Knight Rises) I become weary of Centipede Hz. Even after multiple plays, I've grown numb by the album's end. And this is a shame, since the album is fairly consistent in song-for-song quality. The fact that it's also fairly consistent, song-for-song, in its extreme sound works to the detriment of the album as a whole. Sure, I can see this as a concept, something the band intentionally worked towards. It's quite \\"pure,\\" in that respect. But me, I'd rather have an album that I can enjoy in practice, rather than respect in theory.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that I feel like I need a power nap after listening to this thing, I also feel like it's not quite worth all of the effort. It's a great sound, and there are some good songs, but, as a critic from FACT magazine said: \\"The problem with Centipede Hz is that there's just no room for the listener's own imagination, rendering it a difficult album to connect with.\\" My favorite AC albums are like sound paintings, with strokes of melody and texture that transport you to realms of your mind that you didn't even know existed. As much as I may like or admire Centipede Hz as a project, it really never feels like anything but an amusement park to me.<br /><br />Still, it's worth giving it a try. Aside from the openers, highlights for me are \\"Rosie Oh,\\" \\"New Town Burnout\\" and \\"Amanita\\" (be sure to listen to this closing act before you've overdosed).<br /><br />3 1/2 starsa whole.

B004LGPBZI|2.0|well, i´m not a fan from the OASIS stuff...i like some songs like LIVE FOREVER, SOME MIGHT SAY or CHAMPAGNE SUPERNOVA...and besides the blank and boring posture of OASIS as a live band, i can see some ok moments through their albuns...this BEADY EYE band, it´s OASIS without their best musician and songwriter(NOEL)....there´s not one single good song here...it´s like a collection of the most UNINSPIRED songs from Oasis...if you really like oasis, you may like this BEADY EYE stuff....the truth is, stick with definitelly maybe and what´s the story...
0525953728|1.0|Absolutely do not recommend this book, as the author has essentially sold his soul and honor for money.  If you want to read about a true Navy SEAL hero - recommend you buy the book Fearless.  If you want to read about the raid on Osama Bin Laden, recommend Mark Bowden's book on the topic as he draws information from multiple sources and actually gives an accurate portrayal of the event. The story in this book has been hollywood-ized and exaggerated to make the author money.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|DIRE STRAITS is a real cool ROCK BLUES band...and BROTHERS IN ARMS is their classic!!!! All the songs are great like the hits MONEY FOR NOTHING, WALK OF LIFE, SO FARWAY and the title track!!!! if you like the DIRE STRAITS sound, you will surelly like this ROCK PEARL!!!!! REALLY GREAT!!!!!

I love the collage category, I love all the effects, I have created so many things with this app I don't know what I would do without it, my pictures would just seem dull.  I also love that it connects to my email, facebook, and pinterest so I can upload to all and email to family and friends.  If you are a photo nut like me this is the app for you.  I even have it on my phone, it may as well be a game LOL, I spend hours using this app, love it 5 stars no questions!

B008CPBB0I|5.0|I friend of mine that has children recommended this movie to me.  I was looking for a wholesome feel good movie and that is what Big Miracle provided.  It was a great story that took me up, then down, then up again.  It is a great family movie.

B003KRJNBW|5.0|\\"The Book of Eli\\" was indeed another winner for Denzel Washington. His portrayal of his character was magnificent. His dedication to his work is highly evident as he moves through the scenes and pulls off the most astounding bluff I have seen lately in a movie. I was momentarily disappointed when he gave up the book, but I thought either it was not \\"the\\" book, or he had some other plan to retrieve it. When I saw how it played out, it was a marvelously stupendous surprise.
0439023513|4.0|SPOILERS!<br /><br />I took a peek at some of the reviews prior to reading Mockingjay and was prepared to hate it. I was expecting that Gale, Peeta or even Katniss would be killed off at some point and there would be no happy ending whatsoever. I was thrilled to find out that I was wrong...in fact the last few pages actually brought a tear to my eye.<br /><br />Many of the reviewers here would be \\"capitol people\\" if they were characters in the book. They want to be entertained by all the blood and gore and excitement, and then when that's over the characters who experienced it are supposed to go on their merry way, with Peeta and Katniss running across a meadow in slow motion toward a passionate embrace (again, for the reader's entertainment). After all of the traumatic events that Katniss has lived through in a short timespan, it is impossible to believe that she would move on so easily and right into a stable, passionate relationship.<br /><br />Katniss did not annoy me in this book. I felt she was acting as I would expect based on the circumstances. She reminded me a LOT of the main character in The Language of Flowers (especially the hiding). Her entire life has been about survival. She doesn't have the time and doesn't know how to think about a romantic relationship. She also blames herself for many of the bad things she has witnessed and for her reaction to them, and feels that she is unlovable. The character I DID hate was Gale. From the beginning of the series he pressures Katniss into a relationship, and he gets pissed at her at the most ridiculous times. He strikes me as very selfish. Peeta loves Katniss and would die for her if it came to it. Every time Gale \\"sacrifices himself\\" it's to impress Katniss and pressure her into choosing him. I spent a lot of the book wanting to smack him, but maybe that's because Peeta won me over in book one, and I despise love triangles.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book as much as the other two. It did slog along atfirst, but once they reached the capitol the pace picked up. The ending was just right to me. I liked that I wasn't strung along any further--it was concise and to the point. Peeta and Katniss get their happy ending, but it isn't easy for them. The story is not a fairytale.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|If u like a challenge then this a game for you it has a lot levels that make you think its a creative colorful puzzle and you must connect all the pieces.
030758836X|1.0|I don't consider myself to be much of a prude, but the foul and sexually explicit language in this book was really overdone, unnecessary and just gross.  I was surprised that a very conservative friend recommended this book to me. The plot is okay.  The characters are annoying. I stuck with it to see how it ends---wasn't worth it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|love to play this during Tv commercials. As well as during breaks in housework.  Great graphics easy to see. It is a terrific game.
B000LC4TJ0|4.0|Musically excellent especially the lead performers.  However, too many feathers in actual performance.  I have seen many productions of this opera without the feathers.  Also there is a extra customs' charge of £13.57 on top of the purchase price and this is not mentioned on the website.  The opera was, however, well worth the price I paid.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the performance but could have done without the feathered addition.<br /><br />Christine Harris
B003O86FMW|5.0|fabulous reading! Had me from start to finish.  will be bummed when finished with the series. I hope she writes more soon.
0062101897|5.0|I like it. I think it was kept well and wrapped carefully. With the hard cover it look great though a little heavy. It's not a small book that you can carry with everywhere, but it's still cool only read it home.
B003L77GHE|5.0|I am quite pleased how quickly this arrived. It came literally a day later. So if you don't have prime, it is definitely worth it, but the blu-ray is definitely worth it. The extra scenes that weren't aired and all the little extra things are quite supreme.

0743497465|5.0|\\"I couldn't put it down\\" is a statement that is thrown about so often that it's almost meaningless.  For that reason, I do not use it lightly-- but in this case, it was literally true:  I couldn't put it down.  I had all sorts of things I was planning to do today, but did none of them because I was glued to this book.<br /><br />If you want a fast-paced, well-written thriller full of twists and turns and surprises, then read this book, because it just doesn't get any better than this.
0812993292|3.0|The other 3 star reviews say it quite well.  Ultimately not a satisfying novel.  Too many cliches, repetitive descriptions, undeveloped characters.  He gets to the end of his walk, it's the climax and....well I don't want to give a spoiler but I found the meeting to be a let down, as Harold is.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I thought this app would be boring but i had to check it out.  I love its not strenuous but it keep your brain active for problem solving.  I just want a part 2 or waiting to download and expansion becasue I've already finished.

0312430000|5.0|Atul Gawande, a well-respected surgeon, is the author of The Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Done Right. The book is focused on using checklists as a means of improving quality and reducing defects in such areas as hospitals, businesses, construction projects, airplane flights, etc. Moreover, a number of gripping stories help to convince the reader of the benefits of using checklists across these varied disciplines. The entire book is fascinating and deliberate on its message of using checklists, but the book takes a very interesting turn in chapter eight to see the application of checklists in the business world.<br /><br />In short, checklists=discipline. The checklist helps business professionals be as smart as possible and helps teams improve their outcomes without any increase in skill (p. 168). I love these quotes because it shows that anyone can improve their outcomes today through the use of a simple tool. In the age of complexity, simple tools like a checklist can give someone an advantage over people who think they can remember all the critical details all the time. Using a checklist doesn't mean that someone no longer has to think about basic tasks, rather, it marks the most critical steps (steps that should never be missed) so that more time can be devoted to the critical thinking, based on experience and training.  Sadly, many surgeons (and business professionals) have ignored the checklist because they want to `be in control' and not bound by something that appears to be petty.<br /><br />Chapter eight also highlighted the experience of three investors who used checklists when evaluating companies in which to invest. They noted that the checklists improved their efficiency, allowing them to comb through far more prospects because by the third day it would be very clear which companies were worth continued evaluation and which ones should be dropped. This compares very well with project portfolio management and the benefits of using a checklist at gate reviews. When due diligence is performed, misaligned and doomed projects can be caught earlier on so that critical resources can be put on winning projects. If organizations are disciplined enough to learn from past mistakes and capture the potential pitfalls of projects, they could significantly increase the value delivered through the portfolio of projects. To repeat, this requires discipline.t gate reviews. When due diligence is performed, misaligned and doomed projects can be caught earlier on so that critical resources can be put on winning projects.

0439023513|4.0|Great book and great ending to the series. *Spoilers*<br /><br />Katniss' end is somewhat tragic, though she finds happiness. I was sad to see Finnick die. I feel I have to wait a moment, digest this story before I can move on to the next. The love triangle is not just any love triangle for the sake of having one. It is so believable and delicately woven. Katniss' mental state, for all that she his has been through, speaks true, however hard it may be to see her that way. I knew she loved Peeta from the second book. I'm glad it was realized in the end. Thank you, Suzanne Collins, for a wonderful ride.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I love to read and I have put off reading this book for so long I decided I would go ahead and try it.  Now, since it was on the New York Times Bestseller list I guess I had high expectations.  I also heard so many people saying how provocative this book is and it has so much shock and awe.  So, with that being said....I cannot believe that this book made it to the bestseller list.  WOW.  I almost asked Amazon for a refund after 200 pages.  It was pure agony for me to keep reading it.  I have never had a book just make me so upset by just the writing!!!  After 150 pages went by, I actually did Google the author's name because I just 'knew' that there was no way a woman could write from a woman's perspective like that.  I was thinking it had to be a man writing as a woman, right?  Nope, it was a woman from England who wrote this book and I couldn't believe it!!!  I swear I have not heard the phrase \\"down there\\" or \\"her sex\\" so many stinking times in one book! And I have read those little romance novels.  I didn't keep count by any means but it seemed like those phrases came up a good 50 times or so.  As far as the shocking content of the book?  I didn't really think it was that erotic.  I have read more provocative lines in my murder mystery books.  I do not know what the big deal is with this book.  Honestly.  I did finally finish it and I will keep it, but I don't know if I can re-read it for a  long time and I am one of those people who usually re-reads a series after I finish the whole set because I have a new perspective on the characters.  I have also bought the other 2 in the series just to keep an open mind and I must say they are much better than this one.  However, if you don't read the first one you would be lost on the other two.<br /><br />My opinion is that this book is not a literary wonder by any means and it sure wasn't a shock and awe that it was made out to be, but if you just want to know what everyone read that keeps popping up in every TV show/commercial/etc then by all means read it.  But, maybe you should check it out in the Library or borrow the book instead of spending your money on it.  Not that great.
0439023491|5.0|I couldn't put this down. That ravishing feeling I get when I am thoroughly invested in a book came upon me and that was it. My world was Katniss' world. Every detail thought out. Twists and turns I didn't see coming. Tears I shed for the characters. Peeta and Katniss, Gale and Katniss - painfully beautiful and breathtakingly real.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker was even better than the first book! I loved that it picked right up where it left off in book one answering all of the questions left open in book one.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I thought the adaption from the book was really good. Collins did such an excellent job of characterization from Katniss' point of view. The adaption to film reflects that, and kudos to Ross for his adaption of it to screen. I disagree that Jennifer Lawrence was the only person perfect for this role. Her acting is decent enough. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I think they should have stayed true to the character description. Eye color is one thing but whole character changes is another. The Seam kids are olive skinned with dark hair and gray eyes. It's a minor thing, I guess. Still, I didn't like that. In the end, it is what is and I still loved the movie. The casting of Woody Harrelson as Haymitch was perfect though. He embodied that character fully. I'm looking forward to see how the other two books will be adapted.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|Harris is a good writer. He is clear and easy to read. I also find no obvious errors in his opinions concerning free will. This does not exactly mean I agree; I certainly admire the clarity of both his writing and his thinking. The ideas offered will forward the debate on free will and many who would normally not seriously consider reading a philosophy text will likely read this. That is the best part of Harris' book.
0345803485|4.0|Though this book was not well-written, it got me hooked up to the last book. Quite frankly, it was very twilight-y. The love story was almost the same--a spineless, naive woman falling in love with a he's-got-it-all guy but flawed. I liked the flow of the story. Loved their email n text exchanges. It was an easy read and would leave you with pink blush on the cheeks after you read it. It wasn't so erotic but it would give you a glimpse of a BDSM lifestyle. I'd say this book was more of a love story than a sexual fiction. Don't just expect it to be written the way other best-sellers were. I loved it and I'd rave about it over and over!!!!
B008N1LL42|1.0|I have never walked in on my parents having sex. I have never discovered a roach leg stuck to the inside of the foil lid of my half-eaten yogurt cup. And I have definitely never tongue-kissed a hot girl for half the night just to find out she was a transvestite.<br /><br />But I have watched \\"Battleship.\\"<br /><br />I'm just going to jump right in and say that this movie produces the kind of mental scarring that makes one long for the memory-numbing effects of oxygen deprivation, severe head trauma, and electroshock therapy. I'm having trouble sleeping, frankly. I keep waking up yelling \\"chicken burrito!\\" Drugs and hypnotherapy are doing absolutely nothing for me.<br /><br />I'm not going to give a comprehensive review of this film, because it would require me to mentally revisit it and ... urp ... *gag* ... no.

B000VOC90Y|5.0|...this pack was for my kid at college. He loves it. It's very well-made. I was looking for something that looks like it will last, because he's not very backpack-friendly. Nice heavy-duty zippers, and room for his 17-inch laptop. I wanted something that would protect his expensive laptop, and this is well-padded, along with plenty of (separate pocket) room for his books. Tons of storage space. The carry handle is extra-heavy duty. I think that the rest of the bag will fail before the carry handle. It will probably be here after us humans are gone. If you're a small person, you probably won't like it, so if you're looking for something dainty, this ain't it. It's not small, but my kid is 6'2.
B00009L1TA|1.0|All I want to know is, who was the genius that cast for this film??? Who decided they wanted to completely ruin any form of authenticity and put a generic stereotype macho female gung ho latino infantry soldier (which does not exist on this planet) (Rosylyn Sanchez)in the movie, as a member of the Army's elite Rangers....give me a break. And then of course the nerdy weird, quirky, gay intellectual (played by Giovani Ribisi) who would NEVER even attempt to complete Ranger School...because he would washed out of infantry school. And Samuel Jackson just plain sucks. If you want to make yourself a movie with generic written all over it- get Samuel Jackson to star in it. Yeah.  He plays the same annoying loud mouth jackass in EVERY movie. How this guy makes a living with his obnoxious acting is beyond me.  Decent plot for the film, but badly executed. The acting and casting is a disgrace to Army Rangers....period. I should have known this was a s*** movie when I saw noticed Samuel Jackson wearing a beret incorrectly on the damn cover art. I hate this movie so much I'm willing to spend twice the amount of time I spent watching it just trashing this amateur s*** film.
193413712X|5.0|Tinkers, by Paul Harding, is a wonderfully written tale about dying and about life. The novel begins with George Crosby, an elderly man from Maine, who is dying in his bed. As the story unfolds, we drift back two generations to an quiet man who sells household goods from a wagon and a preacher who speaks of the \\"deep and secret yes\\" in life. This book was a gentle look into the sadness and fullness of being.

B002M2T1UO|2.0|Great series, but it's hard to say the boxed set is really a good deal; I got one with all the paper sleeves, so no discs were scratched or covered with glue, but it *was* missing the very last disc.  Sony seems very helpful; the folks at 800-860-2878 have told me they'll be sending me a copy of the missing disk.  Still; getting to the last two episodes of the series and having to wait a few weeks for the disc to show up?  Not terrible; but certainly a bad surprise.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I TRULY LIKED THIS BOOK,  HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET INSIDE A 15 YEAR OLDS HEAD. ? I FELT FOR HIM AND THE LIFE HE WAS FORCED TO LIVE THROUGH NO FAULT OF HIS OWN
B004V9MU86|5.0|Wow. Markus Zusak is an awesome writer. I read about a page of the preview and clicked 'buy' with absolutely no hesitation. The writing in The Book Thief is beautiful, almost like poetry and very descriptive. Using death as the narrator is an original, interesting idea. The characters are likeable. The prose is engaging. Markus has a lot of talent. And, finally, there's a quality teen book that isn't sappy romance -- or worse, sappy vampire romance. The Book Thief has a little love, but not enough to get irritating, and there are other, stronger themes. Five stars.

B0088X7YMS|4.0|Starship Troopers: Invasion is what I like to refer to as a `fluffy popcorn' movie.<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie that makes you think, then Invasion is not for you. If you want to think, I recommend hunting up a copy of the original 1959 Starship Troopers novel by Robert Heinlein that the franchise is loosely based on.<br /><br />If you are interested in leaving your brain at the door and going along for the thrill ride - and I'm not being insulting here - then Starship Troopers: Invasion is just the movie for you.<br /><br />Invasion is an action-oriented animated CGI that centers on intrepid space marines of the Mobile Infantry. Fan favorite Johnny Rico returns from the live action `Starship Troopers', and now holds the rank of General; he is voiced by a different actor, so don't be expecting Casper Van Dien.<br /><br />Other returning characters from the first live action movie include Carl Jenkins and Carman Ibanez. The remaining characters are all new and exclusive to Invasion.<br /><br />Executive produced by Edward Neumeier (writer of the original Troopers film) and Casper Van Dien (Johnny Rico), the movie is standalone, acting as an almost direct sequel to the original Starship Troopers, with no mention of the 2nd (Hero of the Federation) and 3rd (Marauder) sequels.<br /><br />The CGI animation as compared to the Starship Troopers: Roughneck Chronicles series, is far superior. The plot is standard. The voice acting is standard. Action sequences are well executed. The bug splatter spray is commendable. The troopers now use combat shock frames, which is a nod to the novel's concept of space marines in battle armor, unlike the first film that opted for helmets and protective vests.<br /><br />What starts out as a simple assignment to take back a compromised outpost quickly escalates into a wider mission: why has the starship John A. Warden suddenly gone off the grid? And why is the starship heading directly for Earth? The plot has decent enough pacing, with action scenes interspersed throughout.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film and recommend Starship Troopers Invasion for fans of: space marines, Starship Troopers, space adventure.ng, with action scenes interspersed throughout.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film and recommend Starship Troopers Invasion for fans of: space marines, Starship Troopers, space adventure.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These 3 books just sucked you in.  The storyline kept you guessing as to  what was going to happen next in their lives, and the sex scenes were so hot. I think it was written very well.  I would love to read more books like theres three
0375507256|5.0|Rarely do I encounter a novel that entertains me, challenges me, frustrates me, and pleases me as much as this novel has. David Mitchell has created an epic work of postmodern fiction--one that utilizes narrative structure in a thoroughly unique way that corresponds to the novel's thematic threads of postcolonialism and human interdependence across time and space. By blending what appear to be randomly chosen genres (19th-century travel journal, early 20th-century epistolary novel, contemporary journalistic crime drama, comedic confessional, dystopian science fiction, and post-apocalyptic drama), Mitchell adeptly demonstrates the commonalities among these various narrative forms. No summary could do justice to Mitchell's achievement in \\"Cloud Atlas,\\" a visionary work of metafiction that is as much about why we tell stories, what they do for humanity, and the moral implications of storytelling as it is about the characters and plots in the stories that constitute the larger narrative. If you want to engage a work of literature that will challenge the way you think and evoke profound moral questions as it simultaneously pleases your aesthetic sense of narrative art, I urge you read \\"Cloud Atlas\\" as soon as you possibly can.

1849514003|5.0|This book is excellent. It's probably not the first book you want to read when starting out with cocos. When I bought it initially, I was not ready for the advanced nature of the topics. I have all the cocos books. It is a close call between this book and learn cocos2d by itterheim. Really, they are complimentary. This one covers a little more openGL. It is very clearly written and covers the topic very efficiently. The code formatting is a little funky in the Kindle version, but the author will send you a PDF with proof of purchase. Also, he has some bonus chapters that did not make it into the book. Highly recommended. I'm looking forward to a second volume...
0525953728|5.0|I just downloaded this book early this morning and I can't put it down. I'm more than half way through because it is an easy read. I've never read a book like this before. Like to stick with my girly or self help books. But I wanted to know what happened on that day. It's a part of history that we all lived through. I think the author -- what ever his real name is -- was brave to write it and even braver to have lived it. The explanation of how he, how they trained is exceptional. I highly recommend this book even to those who usually stay away from books like this.<br /><br />I submitted a review half way through this book and gave it five stars. I've just finished it and it's still 5 stars in my book!<br /><br />The author tells it with humility and honesty. It's not blown out of proportion like the media told it (when they were just guessing) and even though I'm usually squeamish about these kinds of books -- I loved this one. It's a piece of history that we not only lived through -- but needed to have happen. I'm forever grateful as we all should be for the men and women who serve our great country. And I'd also like to thank the authors for keeping politics out of it or at least in a few brief mentions -- put the record straight.

1935251740|4.0|Mr. Lanza's arguments for a biocentric reality are particularly interesting to me.  The incorporation of Quantum Physics with Human perception is fascinating.  I have long wondered if the double slit experiment indicates that which I have thought it does.  Mr Lanza has answered that question. It does.  I am also intrigued by the actions of entangled particles sent off in different directions with originaly unobserved circumstances at the end of their journeys.  After the fact of particle A's arriving at its destination unobserved, the subsequent imposition of an observation device in the path of particle B before it strikes its more distant screen causes an after the fact change in the pattern on the measuring screen of A.  In other words particle (photon) A \\"retroactively\\" reverses the manner (wave, interference pattern)in which it has gone through the barrier--from both slits to only one.  Information has been transmitted instantaneously; somehow the particles are still one while, the author claims,possibly a universe apart.  According to Lanza the logical conclusion from this and other even more elaborate experiments is that, \\"Our mind and its knowledge or lack of it is the only thing that determines how these bits of light or matter behave.\\"  From this point some of the author's conclusions become more debatable.  He writes, \\"Without consciousness, 'matter' dwells in an undetermined state of probability.  Any universe that could have preceded consciousness only existed in a probability state.\\"  This is a quantum leap from the micro to the macro--perhaps an invalid one.  He also argues that, due to the first law of Thermodynamics--the indestructability of energy--human energy, measurable he claims,which is the energy of consciousness, of mind, must in some self-aware form or other survive that event we term death.  I would like to believe these things but am left unconvinced.<br />  I enjoyed the book, despite my various doubts and intend to reread it.  Were someone such as myself--degrees in English, in love with math , science, and philosophy--to ask, I would highly recommend Mr. Lanza's book.
B008G33PMI|5.0|This collection is nothing short of amazing!!! Unfortunatly I had never heard of Tarja until years after her departure from Nightwish but from the first time I saw a youtube video of her performing Phantom Of the Opera with Nightwish from the End of An Era concert I have been in love with her voice. In this collection she continues to give her best and sounds so amazing, I was so blown away with her 80's medley and it just goes to show how well she can sing anything, this collection is a must buy!!

NO ( or little) profanity, good characterizations, heart-warming without being sappy. We rate it a 4 and I really want my 29 year old son to see it. He likes \\"off-beat\\" movies. This is a winner!!

0805095535|5.0|This series of personal essays in the second person explore the particulars of one man's existence inside his body. Its origin, strength and weakness are explained in detail, as well as where it has lived and how it has been sheltered, injured and cared for are detailed in precise, elegant prose that rises to the level of poetry, especially during the lists. I just couldn't get enough of the beautiful, dizzying lists in this book; lists of apartments, lovers, reactions, and so on. The best is the paragraph that lists the activities of his right hand. In telling the story of his body, Paul Auster tells the story of his life. A blurb on the back calls him \\"one of our most intellectually elegant writers,\\" and I could not agree more.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

0553386794|4.0|With GAME OF THRONES, Martin has made a valiant opening salvo in what should prove to the most complex and sophisticated fantasy to date. Unlike LORD OF THE RINGS, which basically \\"good versus evil\\" on an epic scale, Martin has created a much more nuanced struggle. Political, sexual, violent...Martin's world is ultimately a very human one, echoing the Middle Ages in structure and brutality, but with the added element of fantasy forces hovering in the background, but rarely coming to the forefront. The episodic nature of the book keeps the complexity organized for the reader, but it does have elements of the old movie serials; each chapter often ending in some type of cliffhanger. This actually prevents the novel from becoming quite as an immersive experience as you are constantly being pulled from a compelling storyline to start another. But it does enable the reader to compartmentalize the complexity of the narrative and considering the page count that is no small feat.  There have been other attempts at bring political intrigue and other elements to fantasy, Zelazny's Amber series comes to mind, but the truly epic nature of this series will end up making it an experience worth your time.
0553381695|5.0|I have loved the books in this series.  Clash of Kings was a gift for my brother.  He also loves the books.  I just purchased the 3rd in the series for him.  There are many well developed characters.  The book has a lot of action and is fast paced.  This is one series that you need to read in order.  I have finished the 5th book and I am anxiously awaiting the next. If you enjoy a complex storyline (but easy to follow), I highly recommend all the books in this series!!
0345535421|4.0|It's fairly obvious that Martin has his favorites: Tyrion, Arya, and Jon Snow's chapters always seem to have added elements of emotional impact and humor that can be lacking in the other sections which seemed to be more about moving the various plots forward than character development. I still struggle with any section featuring Daenarys, which often seems like it's from another book entirely and Theon's transformation seems to be very much out of character based on how he was portrayed prior to this book, but Martin continues to propel his narrative forward and my quibbles are little things compared to the epic quality of this undertaking.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|OK, here is where I get hate mail. This movie is not the be all and end all movie the media would have you think. It was good. Great, no.  I saw Battle Royale first which obviously Suzanne Collins who wrote the book Hunger Games read also. She probably also saw the movie and may have been sitting next to Gary Ross (director of Hunger Games) and during intermission they may have met and said, \\"you know, with some clever changes we could make this for all the Americans who did not see Battle Royale\\".<br />Hunger Games was a very good and well made movie. I just thought it was a total ripp off of Battle Royale without acknowledging it. Kinda like writing a great book about an ugly guy with a big nose who can say beautiful things and not acknowledging the book Cyrano De Bergerac.<br />Anyway, it was good but they changed the rules as the games went on and suddenly having wild beast like dogs appear out of nowhere when the \\"kids\\" are supposed to be battling each other was a stupid addition and not in keeping with the story.<br />As I said it was good and if you can buy the changes in the rules for no good reason and you have not seen Battle Royale then you will enjoy this more than I did.

B005TVYVI2|2.0|After reading the reviews for the tempo trainer ~unreliable... I put pacer into dogpile (search engine) and found watches with that function... saw these watches on Amazon... but the site did not give water resistance.. went to the Pyle site and found they rate 160ft... so done deal...  $33 for compass watch.. 26 for non compass... It has all the other nice features.. simulated sweep second day/date, .01chrono(stop watch),alarm,count down timer... pacer is settable 40 to 180 beeps per minute in increments of 5 (wish it was one) but 5 seems to be good enough... I attach it to my goggles strap..(guess I could put under cap)I rarely wear one. beep is just loud enough... I also use it for running beep every forth pace, and kayaking/cycling where I loop it on my shoulder strap of bib or vest... compass is sweet programs to your location to give true (pole star) north..stays on for a minute and powers down... was showing off to a kayak friend yesterday and he had a much more expensive compass watch and said it shut down to quick to be much use... (and asked me to get him one{he does not use the net) in Kayaking and possibly open water swimming a good compass can be essential... IE fog. (guess Russel Crow could have used one this weekend)...It will be interesting to see what the battery life is.<br />dual time is handy as I set it ~15 minutes early.. to see I can get places on time and not rush.. safer driving etc..

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this because everyone and their momma is reading this book.  My sister went nuts over it, and so did many of my friends.  I read the preview pages and wasn't impressed, but since my circle of friends kept raving about it, I went ahead and jumped on the train.  At first, I thought this book was a comedy.  I was around the same age as Anastasia when I lost my virginity, and it hurt like hell and it sucked.  Actually, my sister and cousins lost their virginity at around the same age I did, and none of them reacted the way Anastasia did.  So maybe we're in the minority, but I thought that portion of the story was ridiculous.<br /><br />Since I couldn't withstand the \\"oh my\\" \\"biting my lip\\" oh my, oh my, oh my (If Anastasia existed in real life, I want to fight her and bust that lip she keeps \\"biting\\"), I stopped reading after she lost her virginity.  I may have lost my virginity at a late age, but I've put a lot of miles on my vagina since then, and I don't know one person that can orgasm with just nipple play.  REALLY?  Although I thought that Christian Grey is a pussy, and wished he would get butt raped by a gorilla, I found him hilarious.  His alleged dirty talk was so over the top I couldn't help but bust out with laughter.<br /><br />I feel bad about not reading the entire book, but if I read another reference to Anastasia's \\"inner goddess\\", I'm going to either slit my wrists or shoot myself in the face.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I very much enjoy the style of writing employed by Michael Connelly.

I enjoyed this book very much!
B0086705Z4|5.0|John Eliot Gardner has given the early music world many fine period-instrument recordings. They are not always to my liking -- I prefer the more muscular Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the more poetic Jordi Savall, or the more exciting Il Giardino Armonico -- but this disc of Bach's motets is quite beautiful. Whereas Harnonocurt's motets rendition is more angelic, Gardiner's are more lyrical and human.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|Be aware that this headset is fragile.  The sound is cool and was worth the purchase.  It is also interchangeable between our PS3 and PCs!  However, we have owned two pairs and both have been too easily broken.  The first fell only 18 inches from a coffee table to a carpeted floor.  Thinking that was an exception, we bought a replacement.  The second snapped while it was being typically removed from someone's head.  The fragile breaking point, in both cases, is the plastic swivel joint between the ear cup and head band.  The engineering of the moving plastic parts does not match the cool technology of the sound.  Our silver lining; we were able to utilize parts from one to repair the other.  Now, just don't sneeze and the merged headset will last a little longer.

B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio became my instant favorite app for the Fire. I live 2-3 hours from most of the surrounding major cities, so I get terrible AM service. That is where most of the great sports radio takes place. It is great for me to tune in to sports talk from Chicago and St Louis, then be able to go around the country to wherever my heart desires. I can listen to my favorite team news from where I grew up and that makes this program the bomb!<br /><br />Admittedly, there are some stations that don't work with TuneIn and that is too bad. Also, if it is a major sporting event in MLB, NFL or the NBA, blackout restrictions apply and I truly understand that.<br /><br />The final sell point is that they feature any kind of music you want. It isn't from SIRIUS/XM with their canned DJ's, but it's hometown music with your local flavor. To me, that is the best thing. I may have never lived in certain parts of the country, but I can get the flavor of being there. Awesome program, TuneIn!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Some of my friends warned me that this movie has some \\"military inaccuracies\\".  As a former Navy  aircraft weapons tech, I am used to spotting such errors. People, this is a movie 1) about an alien invasion, 2) made by the people who brought you the Transformers, and 3) \\"based\\" on the Hasbro board game..how \\"Realistic\\" do you expect it to be?. Seems to me that that loser would have ended up scaping rust off the sides of the ship rather than being an Officer, but I think anyone who has served has run into those types. And sure, nobody is going to get the Mighty Mo up and running that fast, so what, great to see the old girl in action again. I loved it, but then I love anything military with some semblance of a plot and lots of BOOM in it. I'm biased, I especially love it if there are big ships with lots of firepower involved, and nothing beats a Battleship for big time non nuclear explosives. Also good to see some of our Wounded Warriors. I only wish the aircraft carrier and my FA-18's got more screen time. The kids, my husband, and myself all enjoyed it.

B0088X7YU0|5.0|I was absolutely stunned by this Movie!  I m a fan of the First Movie, which was damn good! However, the Starship Troopers franchise lost me with the (two) crappy sequels. Movies 2 and 3 were terrible! But this one...Movie 4.  Wow! Stunning Animation, great script, ...a great (save) for the franchise. I HIGHLY recommend to the franchise to contract the writers and producers of this Animation sequel to also create 5, 6,  7, etc.  This Movie was so great I had to see it again and again, (3) times in a row, over a 3 day period. You have to be a(gamer)to appreciate the video CG Animation, and also be a fan of the very First Starship troopers Movie to truly understand and appreciate this latest installment. I think this movie saved this franchise, and gave it new life. So let's do a Number(5)in full CG animation and see where all goes. Buy this Movie NOW!!!  Its money well spent ...Buy it on Blue Ray only!
B00846TRHY|3.0|Unsure as to give 1 or 5 stars. The Protagonist Sam Childers shows care for all but his family and friends. In real life assuredly I can say he did too many drugs and his brain has been fried. Its a similar story about my dad, trades family for foreigners. For the background of the story, yes there is a problem in Sudan, but the home front needs to be secured before we are able to help others is what I received from viewing.

B008K9SG9K|5.0|I don't do a lot of reviews, but I picked up the album today and have really enjoyed it.  I am a singer myself, and can really appreciate the stellar vocal performance on this album.  I had the privilege of seeing these guys in Scottsdale AZ last year.  There were probably 50 people there that night, and now look at where they have gone in a just a few months.  Their sound is very unique, and melodic.  They are really in a category to themselves - but if I had to classify them, I would classify them as a mix between \\"The Killers\\", \\"Muse\\", and \\"Kings of Leon\\".  My favorite so far is \\"On Top of the World\\" - really uplifting, and a much needed song in this gloomy economy/world that we live in.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I was born in 1944, so I grew up with some of the unrest and problems the country was going through at that time. I agree with the reviews and the comments from those that thought this was a good movie. I have just finished watching this film for the first time and thought it was great. People out there now are so bored by anything less than the far out effects of \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Transformers\\" and try to make comparisons with this movie. Well, this story actually happened!.... all the others are just hype and story book effects.. This is not a special effects movie (although some scenes are extremely realistic) .. Not only are the pilots having to go to war with another country, they are dealing with an internal war of racial discrimination. There seems to be alot of reviewers that pick apart this film because the \\"exact details were not correct\\" or \\"the language was incorrect for the time\\" ... etc. etc. Well, you are missing the point! Just watch the movie for what it is and try to imagine how would you have reacted in a similar situation... This film represented a part of American History that, as far as I am concerned was not a shining moment in time. But, for what it is, this film presents itself as a great little film with a couple of minor flaws. Now that I have purchased it, I will enjoy watching it many more times as well.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I've been a fan since I caught episodes of it late at night when I was a senior in high school (Circa 2004-2005). I have West Wing withdrawals, and this is part of a long wish list of complete series sets. Great series, great cast, great writing! .. Now, if it only came in Blu-Ray... *hint* :)

B004L35GAQ|5.0|This is an AWESOME album. I had download it ENTIRELY and I loved it so much I HAD to get an original copy. Buying music is supporting the artist, and this is an amazing job this Aaron Bruno guy did; unlike most pop & rap crap you hear today on the radio, this is an artist that actually deserves every penny I paid for TWO (yeah, not one, TWO) copies of this album.

B0079IEPHA|5.0|\\"Suits\\" provides the viewer with excellence in writing, (themes/plot/fact based), set designs, on site photography and most talented actors.  A summer series that needs to become a winter series as well.  Ahhh, and let's not forget to mention the beautiful aerial views/street scenes of New York City!  This program is as clever as its name suggests....lawyers in suits, filing suits......certainly suits me!
0446530573|3.0|I bought this book because I was a latecomer to the TV series. Having watched (almost) the entire series in a couple of weeks, I was addicted to the constant mentions and depictions of food. I come from an Italian background but many of the dishes are foreign to me as they seem more Americanised (manicotti, for one). I was intrigued to read the book and cook up some of the recipes. So far, I've read the book but still haven't taken it into the kitchen. That'll happen soon enough.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I found the book very tongue in cheek, almost like a caricature of the series with the characters pretending to be their onscreen personas. It's amusing, entertaining and a must-read for Sopranos fans. It's just a little escapism, nothing particularly substantial. Grab it!
B003VANOFY|4.0|The first thought I had when I pulled the G930 out of its box is that it seemed of high quality, something that I have come to expect from Logitech products. The headset has a nice feel to it and I was not disappointed when I put it on - it felt  quite comfortable.<br /><br />After installing the software for it and messing around with the options for a while, I found myself impressed with how many customizable options there were for me to mess with so that I could have it preform exactly as I wished. I was given the basic abilities to change the sound and microphone capture levels, but I was also able to adjust the sidetone and the sound levels of the individual speakers within the headset. This sort of option could come in handy if I felt the sound was too low or high in the back speakers, but the default configuration sounded great as is so I had no need to change it. I was also able to adjust treble or bass easily, or I could go into detail and have the headset boost or reduce sounds at specific decibel ranges. Outside of the sound options, the software let me easily program the G keys to do whatever I wanted, and it even had native support for Ventrillo, which is what I use my headset for anyway. I even found that the software came with a couple of voice morphers which were a nice little extra feature to mess around with.<br /><br />When I began to use it regularly I noticed that it still upheld my expectations if not surpassed them. The sound was great, it was clear and the surround sound was extremely believable. The headset itself sealed out almost all outside noise which is my reasoning for feeling the need to use the sidetone option (so that I could hear myself speak and not start yelling). The microphone picked up my voice extremely well, and the fact that the whole thing was wireless made it all the better - no more would I get cords tangled up or would they get wrapped around my chair just to trip me when I went to get up. Not only that, but the range was significant enough for me to get up and roam around my house with it still on listening to music and talking with friends without issue. Granted I have a small house so the signal could reach most everywhere with relative ease, but for something that is designed to just work at the desktop I was quite impressed.<br /><br />Of course, with any wireless anything, one must deal with the problems that arise as a result of not being directly corded in. The battery life on my G930 is only just sufficient enough. It charges up quickly enough, but the charge holds only just long enough for an extended \\"gaming session\\". By that I mean for about 10 hours, which by most wireless battery standards is pretty good. On normal days that is plenty, but on my days off I sometimes find myself left with a dead battery at the end of the day. This leaves me unable to communicate with friends through voice and can be a serious problem if it goes out during a game. I would be perfectly OK with this battery life if the headset only had the capability to charge while in use. Technically, it can, but the charging cord itself is not only extremely short, but the cord going from the dongle (where the reviver is plugged in) to the headset, which is the only part of the whole cord that has the right connector for the G930, is even shorter. So unless you like to have to lean over or have the dongle and receiver hanging from your head while you play, this is not a useful way to charge when it has need of being used. I would really like to see a viable plug and play sort of option in this headset so that it could act as a hybrid wireless/corded headset to fit whatever situation the user may find themselves in.<br /><br />The only other problem with this headset is the software itself - the driver that runs it. It can be quite buggy and can cause frustration, but in all reality the only time a problem with this arises is when the headset looses connection or signal - then the adjustable sidetone and microphone levels may decide to revert back to some random level instead of what you left it at when it was last in use. Hopefully this will be fixed with a patch, but the product has been out for some time now and the problem still persists, even though there are many people complaining about this issue.<br /><br />Despite these problems, the benefits and features found in using this headset far outweigh the issues and make the G930 a worth while purchase. I would like to see it improved upon, but if you are looking for a good, gaming grade wireless headset, you will find none other that are any better than the Logitech G930, especially for this price.

0525953728|5.0|Checked to see if this book had been linked to my I-pad and now I can't seem to put it down !  It is a great story ,told with humility about his training and deployments. Wondered how the book was being treated by the reviewers and decided to put my two cents in.The pictures are at the end of the book.
1455502758|5.0|I was ecstatic when I went to the bookstore this morning and saw that Barnes and Noble had Mortality all laid out for my arrival, even though the 'official' publication date is tomorrow. I bought it without a second thought and dove right in to the articles chronicling Hitchens's bout of esophageal cancer, which led to his death last December.<br /><br />The book is, admittedly, short because of the untimely demise of its brilliant author, but that does not in any way detract from its own brilliance. Hitchens writes with his typical blend of clarity, charm, and, even in the face of death, dry humor. This is different from earlier works of his because of how intensely personal the work becomes as he discusses the ups and the downs of his \\"year of living dyingly\\".<br /><br />As if that wasn't enough, the Foreword by Graydon Carter and the Afterword by Carol Blue (Hitchens's wife at the time of his passing) are both moving and heartwarming pieces of work in and of themselves that show Christopher as seen by those that knew -- and loved -- him best.<br /><br />If you, like Carter and Blue, loved Hitchens or hated him, supported his stand against organized religion and tyranny the world over or were one of the many who despised him, you owe it to yourself to spend the $15-20 and read this final work. It is, to my mind, one of the greatest swan songs ever created -- even if the composer had to leave before the masterpiece could be completed.<br /><br />That was always the beauty of Hitchens, though; no matter how much he gave in his writing, his speeches, or what have you, you were always left wanting a little more. It seems almost fitting that, even at the end, all you can do is want a little more.
0091940737|2.0|I heard Ms. Moran on the radio and thought she was hilarious, and so wanted to read this book.  Unfortunately, I did not like the book as much as I wanted to, and Ms. Moran's writing is nowhere near as funny as she was on the radio, and I stopped reading halfway through.<br /><br />You have to laugh as she describes her young-teen crush on Chevy Chase, the trauma of her first period, and the pressure to remove bodily hair.  (After some razor cuts, she forgoes shaving off her new hair, determining that no one is going to see it for years anyway.)<br /><br />Many of Moran's observations are hilarious, but every once in a while I hit a speedbump where she just rambled and it started to bore me.  After a while, she couldn't even shock me anymore.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This story is very romantic !  The love story is like a fairy tale . One you only cud dream about . It is very graphic and has some bad language that I didn't like tho .

0439023491|3.0|I really loved The Hunger Games and was happy I bought all three books at once so there wasn't any wait time. I needed to find out what happens to all the characters! Unfortunately, Catching Fire wasn't quite a love fest as The Hunger Games was for me.<br /><br />The pacing seemed really off from the start. Even though I would have liked the book to have picked up before all the time had passed (close to six month after the end of The Hunger Games if I remember correctly), that didn't bother me as much as having this really slow start. Granted, I thought The Hunger Games also started slow, but because it is the second book, the reader is most likely already familiar with the world and the main characters so I thought it was a little too slow for what these books are. Throughout this particular novel, I feel there are speed-ups and slow-downs that kind of throw the flow off, at least for me.<br /><br />Another issue I had with this book was that it skipped over things I would have liked to have information on.<br /><br />***SPOILER***<br />For example, even in the beginning when Peeta and Katniss have to visit each district, we find little out. I think it was a missed opportunity for Collins to really help the reader understand more about the districts, especially considering everything that happens in the third book.<br /><br />Finally, I realize that the whole point of the book was explaining the spark of the rebellion, but I think in some ways the execution failed in this novel. It could be the pacing issue that I mentioned earlier because it just felt too slow and it repeated the first one without the spark that kept me interested the first time (no pun intended).
0451169514|4.0|I will start by saying that I love Stephen King.  His story telling out-weighs about anyone, and his descriptions make you feel like you're there.<br /><br />Anyone who frequents King's work knows how descriptive he is.  He doesn't leave too much to the imagination, by describing everything in great detail.  The descriptions can be a little hard to get through, but he definitely makes up for it in his story-telling.<br /><br />Another classic part of King is his crudeness when it comes to sexuality.  There are parts of this book that made me feel, just disgusting.  So if you are easily (or even mildly) turned off of a book because of very crude sexuality, then \\"It\\" is definitely not for you.  Having that capability also shows his talent in story-telling, not only having an effect on the reader with the parts they enjoy,  as well as the parts they do not.  I do not find it fair to mark the book down more than I have for his talent, although it may not be in everyone's favorite taste.<br /><br />If at all possible read the book before seeing the made-for-TV movie.  I realize that can be quite impossible.  The book was finished about 5 years before I was born.  I have been watching the movie since I was 6 (not quite at a Stephen King reading level, although I read my first King book about 6 years later).  The movie is both one of my husband and my favorite movies, so not comparing the book to the movie was quite impossible.
B0010Z32OA|5.0|Great script, great acting. It's a wonderful movie, but moreover it is an exquisite piece of a fairy tale. It's a classic. De Niro is indeed hilarious. Claire Danes beautiful and charming. I must have seen it three times already.

B005DJGMQE|5.0|excellent movie for anyone who is a lincoln buff....i was not aware of a lot of the facts of the trial
0756405890|4.0|Writing style: Great but not perfect.  Conversations flow nicely and are not forced by the author.  He has a keen ability to paint a picture with his words without over embroidery.  Characterization is strong for the main character but weak for some of the supporting characters.  However, most characters develop nicely.<br /><br />Setting:  The most common cliché in fantasy books; the author plays it safe and sticks with a traditional fantasy world.  No complaint here, it works<br /><br />Magic:  Very unique and interesting idea.  Not the best magic system but definitely not the worst.  His magic does not distract from (or add to) the main story line; it's more of icing on the cake here.<br /><br />Character Development: Unlike most fantasy books, this one isn't written by the author; Kvothe writes this book through his actions and the author just tries to keep up.  Take note, this is how books should be written.  Kvothe develops very nicely, has his flaws, and yet is very likeable.  In my opinion, Kvothe is the best character I've ever had the pleasure of getting to know.  Unfortunately some of the supporting characters come off as a bit flat and unrefined.<br /><br />Conflict:  The Author does a marvelous job setting suspense and conflict throughout the book.  He builds the conflict subtly and slowly yet the reader can feel the coming storm and its going to be good.  Without spoiling the experience, there are three major conflicts: Kvothe vs \\"evil\\" (not going to elaborate, read the book), Kvothe's love interest, and a unique conflict between the reader and the book itself:  As you may or may not know, Kvothe narrates the story and the books switches between his present and past character.  The reader immediately notices a vast discrepancy in Kvothe in the story and the Kvothe telling the story (they are almost two different people).  The reader notices the subtle changes in Kvothe's character throughout the book from who he was to who he is; there is a mystery the reader must discover in order to piece these two vastly diverse characters together.  The suspense is killing me even now as I type.  In the mean time, there are plenty of \\"lesser\\" conflicts between Kvothe and his professors and class mates.  If you ever read the book, try to think Ender's Game here: [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]]<br /><br />Major draw backs:  While the second book only gets better (much better), the reader is left with a cliff hanger until book three is released.<br /><br />Overall: I couldn't put it down.  Many hours of lost sleep from this book.  A completely unique idea and writing style that draws me in like nothing I've read before.  The book has some clichés but overall a new flavor of fantasy.  The only book better than this one is the second: [[ASIN:0756407125 The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two (Kingkiller Chronicles)]]

B008EEB4TA|5.0|My review of this album is similar to this album: [[ASIN:B005G6QF8Y Perfectionist (Amazon MP3 Exclusive Deluxe Version) [Explicit] [+Digital Booklet]]]. It is like Marina dove into my mind and programmed this CD to my personal sound taste. I'm glad she put out an album with more than 10 tracks, also. I feel like I'm getting jipped when its only 10 songs.<br />I finally purchased the whole album after getting a taste of PRIMADONNA for free and finding it catchy and something fresh from a new artist(for me anyways). Marina did a great job on this album. Excellent beats along with snippy, dark-pop, introspective lyrics. Her ability to write creative lyrics is her biggest strength as an artist. I have yet to go back and listen to her older album, but this album stands very well on its own. I have read places that she wanted to go for a pop sound to make a statement and also fulfill a personal goal of being a pop star. I think with this album she could do that in the most ironic way. If she ever comes to my city to perform somewhere, I'd go. I'd want to see how her voice would sound live, what she really looks like through the lenz called my eye, and see how she does a show. Her voice has a unique overall sound and I'd be interested to see what she uses in her music. There are some neat instruments, sounds like the harp in PRIMADONNA.<br /><br />The reason I almost gave it a 4 instead of a 5 though was because her voice just sounds so much like Katy Perry's in certain songs. Not that its that bad, but she does some of the things that Katy Perry does with her voice that I don't enjoy. For example, when singing HYPOCRITES, I think she fluctuates her voice unnecessarily. At the same time, her voice is very sexy especially in lower registers. I love her voice because it has great pitch most of the time. I love the slight opera sound she has and she has amazing range. And the whole record sounds like an opera of her love life. My first few listens through the album I thought there were some songs that sounded similar to one another in theme and background. But after listening to the album for the better part of 2 months, I think she is just pure talent. I discovered songs that are on different versions of the album and I wish I could have those ones too. I've also tried catching clips on youtube and interviews w/ her. I hope that she doesn't lose her motivation like she did between Family Jewels and Electra heart because I'm interested to see what she comes up in the future.<br /><br />Highlights for me were RADIOACTIVE, PRIMADONNA, BUBBLEGUM BITCH, HOMEWRECKER, HOW TO BE A HEARTBREAKER and STARRING ROLE. Which is almost half the album. Yes it is really GOOD, listen to the whole thing.<br /><br />Update: Its been a little over a year and I still have this album on repeat. Even after I saw Marina live, I needed to hear at least one song of hers everyday. For this reason I changed my review to 5 stars. Marina is a diamond in the rough & I'd like to claim myself as one of her biggest diamonds.there were some songs that sounded similar to one another in theme and background.

1250010489|5.0|Disclaimer: Mark is a former colleague of mine at Microsoft. He gave me an autographed hardcopy of Trojan Horse a few weeks ago (enabling me to cancel my pre-order here on Amazon).<br /><br />I am a huge fan of 'noob' fiction authors and will generally give them one chance. With Mark's first book, the prequel to Trojan Horse, called Zero Day I was won over. While Zero Day started a little slow and had a few plot issues, it was a seriously good first novel. Part of that was the technical depth and resulting plausibility that comes from the fact that Mark truly is one of the software wizards of our time. But he's also a solid writer.<br /><br />Trojan Horse demonstrates that Mark has been paying attention to his writing mentors and the feedback he's gotten. It is, from a writing perspective, a really, really solid work. If you didn't know this was only his second novel you'd be surprised after reading it.<br /><br />From a story perspective, I'll just say this:  I started reading it at about 4pm and couldn't put it down until I finished it at about 2:30am the next day.  It is exciting, intriguing, and technically compelling. Plus it actually has a plot that is carefully crafted from start to finish.<br /><br />If you are in the \\"industry\\" and are not already scared enough about cyber-warfare Trojan Horse will push you over the edge.  If you are just a fan of tech-thrillers you'll likely very much enjoy this book...and then you'll go make sure you have solid anti-virus software installed on your notebook computer and you are using strong passwords....

Palacio's \\"WONDER\\":<br /><br />WESTERLY MIDDLE SCHOOL ADDRESSES BULLYING<br />WITH REQUIRED SUMMER READING<br /><br />Hats off to Principal Paula Fusco and her Middle School staff for their plan to begin the school year on a very positive note by having all students, grades five through eight, read R. J. Palacio's recent book entitled, \\"WONDER,\\" prior to the opening of school.  Following her One School One Book practice, the entire student body, faculty, and staff will be prepared to hold classroom discussions based on Palacio's story about Auggie, an entering fifth grade boy who was born with a severely disfigured face.  Under the best of circumstances, the middle school years can be a daunting experience.  Given Auggie's physical issues and his previous sheltered home schooling situation through grade four, the challenges that lie ahead for him in fifth grade are extraordinary.<br /><br />In an era where far-too-many headlines point to the pain and anguish suffered by so many students as the result of the torment, the teasing, and the cruel behavior that they endure both in school and out of school, it is reassuring that our Middle School is gearing up to be proactive in addressing the emotional health of our student population. Learning cannot occur when children do not feel safe. While the author describes many examples of inappropriate reactions by schoolmates to Auggie's appearance as he enters fifth grade, the book also demonstrates how acts of tolerance, acceptance, understanding, and empathy can lead to a healthy school environment.  It is hoped that the scheduled classroom discussions regarding the reading assignment will encourage all students to become more sensitive to the feelings of their peers.<br /><br />A note sent home to all parents with the reading assignment urges the adult members of the family to read the book along with their children and to hold discussions with them concerning how to act in bullying situations.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|Many folks have commented on the features of the watch so I will focus on my issue with what is otherwise a good piece of equipment: the strap.  There is a small rubber retaining loop (holding a metal 'Garmin' logo) used to secure the loose end of the wrist strap.  The rubber on the loop around the metal garmin logo is very thin, wears away easily and then leaves you with a poorly fastening watch.  I've replaced this once already and its just failed again (I've had the watch for about 18months). Unfortunately the replacement is expensive as it comes with a completely new strap.  To give a little more context, I have worn the watch at most 3-4 times a month for hiking and cycling and expected it to last longer given relatively this light use and that it is designed for sports/outdoor life.  This all hints that Garmin isn't adequately stress-testing its products.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Suffice it to say that this movie was an absolute delight to share with my family! I grew up watching the Muppets on TV, but my 3 sons (age 9 and twins age 7) had never seen any of the Muppets shows or movies and my husband grew up overseas and had never seen any either. I was a bit skeptical that any of us would enjoy it--would my sons and husband \\"get it\\" or will I be disappointed that this movie seems watered down from what I remember years ago?  All fears were unfounded. I laughed and reminisced and enjoyed the fact that I was finally old enough to get all the adult jokes. My sons absolutely enjoyed every bit of it and laughed at all the silliness the Muppets dished out as did my husband. The Muppets is a rare treat that delights viewers of all ages and is a classic that belongs in every family's video library.

B0070XFNDE|4.0|The Prisoner of Heaven was delivered to my Kindle via Amazon.com.. Easily to fastest and most efficient way of obtaining a vast number of books. Thousands of books are at one's disposal in an instant and in other languages. I have ordered books in Spanish and have been delighted with the selection and service.<br /><br />The Prisoner of Heaven is a wonderful tale with all the required elements of mystery, suspense, thrills and love. It also has a very dark and preverted side that takes you to the shadowed underbelly of Barcelona. You will meet devious, degenerate and sadistic characters. Some will be old friends from[[ASIN:0767931114 The Angel's Game]].The story unfolds in a dank and dirty prison (Prison of Heaven) where people are sent to languish for an indefinite  length of time. The govenor of said place is more perverted and degenerate than any of the inmates. Threats, torture and deprevation are dished out on any given day.<br /><br />A subplot is the Govenor's own history and how he obtains the position of power he enjoys while at the same time loaths. He is disgusted by the weak and sniveling people who surround him. He perceives them all, inmates as well as the jailors, to be his inferiors therefore subhuman. Later in the story he plays a key roll in Barcelona politics as well as in the misery and demise of several beloved characters.<br /><br />This is the continuing history of Sempere & Sons from \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Carlos Ruiz Zafon. Where we are introduced for the first time to a cast of colorful personages. The Prisoner of Heaven is an excellent read that will keep you perched on the edge of your seat and  anxiously waiting  for the next novel which will be out next June. I loved it and have already read it several times and hope that after reading this review you will enjoy it as much. The other two books I mentioned I also purchased from Amazon.com. a great way to buy.<br />Bookwormetc
030758836X|2.0|When the book finished my first thought was, \\"That can't be it.\\" Then I became upset- why spend so much time inventing a clever, intelligent story only to end with so much left undone? Truly disappointed. I enjoyed the book immensely until I finished it. It's up to the author to finish the story, not end it halfway through.
0439023513|4.0|This isn't an example of the best writing, but for a young-adult book, it is certainly thought provoking as it reflects to some degree, the world of today (and future).<br /><br />While reading, I was attempting to figure out how it would end.  I completely forgot about the beginning and IMHO it 'gave away' the ending.<br /><br />No direct spoilers here, but the beginning of the story introduces Buttercup, the cat who Katniss tried to drown (no food for cat), but whose life was spared on Prims request.  Katniss (sort of) saved/spared Buttercup's life.  In the end, it was Buttercup who 'saves' Katniss from a certain death.<br /><br />The Katniss/Buttercup encounter at the end was one of the most emotional scenes in the entire series (Rue scenes gets 2nd best).<br /><br />I highly recommend this trilogy.  I was NOT disappointed. :)
1400082773|5.0|Dreams From My Father is an amazing read from a truly historical figure. Most historical figures are polarizing to some extent, with reviews on this site providing hyperbolic evidence of that. Seriously people, disagree with Obamacare all you like, there's nothing socialist about it, it's crony capitalism at its' finest.<br /><br />I don't love everything Obama's done (some bankers should be in jail) but we're in one less war, the Dow has doubled, Bin Laden's dead, middle class taxes are lower, GM and Chrysler still exist and my kids can't be turned down for insurance due to a pre-existing condition. That's all pretty damn good.<br /><br />Back to the book: Obama's insights on race in America are so eloquent, so insightful that you feel like you're living his life as he's experiencing it. As a white person my only real understanding of in group/out group dynamics was observed or discussed with friends of other races. 'Dreams' dives much further into the psychology of race and how it forms ones identity, adding to it the cultural dynamics that come from limited power and limited resources. Obama was smart enough to do anything he wanted, he could be a billionaire right now, instead he chose to help people. I can't imagine better evidence of character and conviction than that.<br /><br />Those of you calling the book racist, you don't get it. Read about in group/out group dynamics, try to put yourself in his shoes as he has these experiences. Frustration with institutional racism is not the same as being racist. America has a lot of problems to fix, the remnants of Jim Crow are still there, schools are more segregated now than they were prior to the Brown ruling. Be happy that Obama worked to help the poor, it's a hell of a lot more likely he can relate to your situation as a result.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Could use an update for kindle fire. Runs a little slow. Otherwise it is a great app. I find I spend more time on it than I planned. I can't put my kindle down when I'm on this app.
B005GHN2GG|4.0|First order of business;  I have to gush about the cover art! Best cover art ever! This beautiful piece of work was created by the talented Louisa Gallie. She is a Concept Artist, Illustrator and she also designs e-book covers. And after reading this book, I have to agree with what Ms. Draven wrote in her dedication.<br /><br />\\"... an enthusiastic thank you to Louisa Gallie who found the heart of this book and brought it to vivid life...\\"<br /><br />That she did! This artist really captured the essence of this book. It's exactly the way I pictured it. Amazing!<br /><br />Okay, well, I could ramble on and on about the importance of fantastic cover art. How crucial and sometimes overlooked it can be. But, I won't bore you with my musings and statistics. Instead,  I'll get right to reviewing the content.<br /><br />Master Of Crows is a Fantasy/Romance that is threaded with darkness, arcane magic and has an antediluvian/medieval vibe<br /><br />This book seemed more like a romance then fantasy to me. The romance is a slow progression, but once it's out there it's all about the lovin' and the fantasy aspect takes a back seat. For some reason that disappointed me.  I was really getting into the fantasy world that Ms. Draven so beautifully created that I sort of forgot this book was categorized as a Romance as well. I would have liked the romance toned down just a little in order to evenly balance with the fantasy.<br /><br />However, I was not disappointed in the characters. I thought the consistency was there. I know some reviewers scoff at the servant/master role between Martise and Silhara but I have to disagree.<br /> Martise, was raised  a slave. Taught to serve in the house of Asher. This is all she knows. That is who she is and we do see her progress slowly out of that role as she discovers her powers. Later on, we see she is treated like a mate and equal.<br />Silhara, is a brooding loner type who has pushed people away his whole life. Other Mages have feared himand treated him as an outcast. He assumes that role. However, Martise is able to break through that protective wall he has so stubbornly created and thus, drops his guard long enough that we as readers get a chance to see the man Martise has fallen in love with.<br />Silhara and Martise are the main protagonists  is this tale but my heart goes  to the supporting character Gurn.  Gurn is the man-servant of Silhara, and is mute. I was so impressed with how skillfully Ms. Draven wrote his character. Obviously he has no dialog but his personality shines through the pages with the way she has so artfully scripted his actions and expressions. From a writing stand point, that is truly an impressive feat. I smiled when he smiled and felt frustrated and angry when his character did as well. Gurn's character was an unexpected surprise and he stole the show for me.<br /><br />Grace Draven is a wonderful descriptive writer. She sucked me into the land of Neith and I had no trouble at all visualizing all of the layers and subtile details. A talented and promising author that I expect will produce nothing but superior work in the future.<br /><br />I recommend this book for those of you who love a romance first and a fantasy second. I give Master of Crows 4 stars. A great book for the antiquated romantic at heart.
B0086700CM|4.0|this app is great and addictive. although it is repetitive it is still really fun to play. I recommend this app to anyone.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|Ok so this is another underlooked item in the Best Buy $5 bin. And as far as action movies go this may not be my #1, but this is insanely awesome! I think that if they ended the movie after the first hour, it would have been better though. And, here is why ( i will try not to spoil the movie) basically, the movie starts and is non-stop action until it climax's (with a knife against a man's throath and rambo saying I could easilly kill all of you) and then after that it becomes less awesome. Personnaly though I don't care because it is so intense, and so .... I meen rambo has a knife ( a big knife) and can easilly live in the woods like hes in Vietnam. And he has about 6 men chasing him in the woods, and only one of them thinks its a bad idea, (Haratio Kane from CSI). That being said, they know who he is and still want to kill him.  So, the vengeance is there and I feel like rambo should peel there flesh off bit-by-bit when he gets the chance, and when he doesn't it doesn't make him less of a man. I don't understand his choices though, and maybe I am just too far gone and want to see some heads roll. But, not very many heads roll. And that is what I will say, watch this and be amazaed at Sylvester Stallone in all his bad-ass glory, just don't be too upset when the ending is kind of a let down. A lot of action, and a lot of blood, and even some scenes where rambo is sewing up open wounds, and splinting broken bones. No detail is left out in these scenes, so maybe the faint at heart stay away from this flick? all you go-hards grab this, and I would check out best buy first (especially if you have best buy gift cards)
0062082353|3.0|Spoiler Alert: I climbed up on a roof and shot a couple of Iraqis. I climbed up on another roof and shot a couple more. I got in a bar fight but it wasn't my fault. Repeat. Kyle gets an extra star, to a passing grade of 3, because his take on the officer corps is spot on. How do I know? Because I am an ex-Navy \\"puke\\"--a group Kyle repeatedly disparages.
B008CP93S0|1.0|Interesting concept with potential.  Unfortunately it didn't go far or deep enough and didn't really have the substance for either a social commentary or even a comedy.  The acting was OK but I wish I could have used my evening watching a better movie. Hot Tub Time Machine is much better because it was a comedy that stayed a comedy and didn't attempt a deeper meaning.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|great game good graphics. very interesting story line. I play this game all of the time.  you can free roam the city and fofill missions and do side jobs

B005LZW9CG|4.0|This Phil Collins 24 kt Gold CD is sonically superior to my original (Made in Japan Atlantic 80035-2) CD that came out in the mid 1980's.<br /><br />I did a direct comparison between the two discs and the AFZ 129 was superior in just about all respects. The original Atlantic CD sounded bright and thin and there there was a lack of solidarity and impact on the drums and bass. Phil Collins voice sounded clean and clear on the 1985 disc, one quality I do like on the original, but the mid-range was thin and lacking body on my Japanese original CD.<br /><br />Vocal material on this Steve Hoffman reissue simply had more depth and substance and the listener was placed close to the front of the stage on this CD. For those familiar with the 1990's DCC releases this Audio Fidelity is Not as warm, rich or fat sounding as those CD's manufactured two decades ago and in that regard is more modern sounding. It has greater detail and clarity than the earlier DCC gold CD's (which I like), but lacks a bit of the analogue warmth and fat body qualities of the earlier Hoffman releases. In short the DCC discs sounds like it was mastered with tubes while the Audio Fidelity sounds like it was mastered with solid state electronics. I personally like certain qualities of both but in general prefer tubes if I had to pick one. Would have been nice to hear this mastered with tubes in the chain.<br /><br />In any event this is a very good sounding Gold Disc that is sonically the best you will likely hear from this Digital format. My original UK vinyl LP still sounds the best over all other formats but if you like the music this AF release is worthy indeed and recommended.<br /><br />Johnny
B002N1AEN2|5.0|such a great album! it has been in constant rotation since i bought it. dreamy electro-pop at it's best. can't wait for the next album to be released.
034580404X|5.0|Couldn't put this Trilogy down...only took me a month to read all 3 books.  Even though there was a great deal of erotic parts to the books, it held you in suspense with the full plot which was great!  Fun read.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book. I love erotica but I dont really think this book is really erotica. Yes, it has lots of descriptive sex scenes but I dont really think that is the basis per se. I feel like Ana and Mr. Gray are finding out who they really are through their sexual chemistry. I could totally be wrong but that is just my opinion. I wasnt expecting to like this book and I fell in love with it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|If you like puzzles these are the best.  I have all the FlipPix and I think they are all GREAT.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I think angry bird seasons is a great idea. it is a bit hard, but not too much. so far I haven't had any adds come up.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wasn't so sure that I wanted to read the books just from what everyone was saying and some of the reviews that I read.  Those people were way wrong!!!  This is the best book trilogy that I have ever read.  There is a story line and to me there was more than just the sex in the books and for people to say that they can skip chapters are wrong they would miss things.  I could not put this book down and will definitely read them again.  I absolutely can not wait until they get the movie out on dvd!!!  And I hope that E L James the author writes a forth book I would definitely buy it!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG Its so addicting. ii also have it on my ipad. I love tablets. I have it on all my phones and tablets.if I had a million dollars I would get this on all my devices. great work. I'm so wierd!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is just too fun and a way to relax.  Wish there was a way to earn cash and not have to buy it though.
B0088TG252|1.0|I'm as big a fan of simple action movies as anyone, but the plot in this movie is simply incoherent. Why did Denzel turn himself in in the first place?  Why does Reynolds pull a gun on local police officers?  None of the actions of the major characters makes any sense, and the reveal doesn't help-- it just hopes that you didn't remember the first 20 minutes, I suppose, because it makes everything all the more illogical. Then, the big reveal just follows the now all too formulaic plot of most CIA oriented movies of the past decade or so.  The action here is good, and the acting decent, but it can't make up for the writing.
0345803485|1.0|My best friend tells me that I must absolutely read these books so I spent $30 bucks and purchased the paperbacks.  Please note that we are both in our mid 50s and she suggests to me that it improved her sex life...gotta check this out, right?  Now, I read Harlequin romance novels in my late teens and that's the first thing I noticed... it reminded me of those books.  Of course once this young woman discovers Mr Grey and his predictable perfection, all hell breaks loose in S&M mode. The thing is I kept asking myself why am I reading this junk? I didn't care for the descriptive sex scenes nor her virginal ignorance, much less for the perfect Mr Grey's attitude toward women...(anyone besides me predict how it had to be a females fault that he was so screwed up?)  Needless to say I won't be reading books two and three since I barely got through the first book.  I'm certain that the writer is a young woman who has read Harlequin type novels and realized in todays 'anything goes' market she could sell pornographic romance and make BIG money.  I'm out $30 bucks to prove it she's right. I'm embarrassed to admit I bought them or read past the first chapter. Target audience: young impressionable girls, dirty old women and perhaps those young men looking for pointers, oh my.

B008BM9L72|4.0|To my surprise I found this trilogy to be a great read ! Was a little worried when I purchased it given all the warnings about it's kinkiness. It's not that bad and a good read as well.<br />Made me think of a few things in my personal life ;-)

B006LQQ1GE|3.0|The first time I heard \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" on the radio, I fell in love with it.  The song had intresting instrumentation, good vocals and lyrics, and a complex rhythm.  After repeated listenings, I still enjoy this song.  I was also immediately attracted to the second song \\"Easy Way Out.\\"  The last two cuts, \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Bronte\\" are also quite good.  This leaves seven songs in the middle.  Sadly, I really haven't connected with these songs despite playing the CD many times.  They aren't bad.  They simply aren't great in terms of how I grade my music.  Once this CD goes on my storage rack, I don't see myself pulling it out often.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game starts out a little slow, but gets very challenging.  This is a fun game to play.  Definitely worth a try.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|More of the same from books 1 and 2. This was the best of the 3, but none were really worth printing or reading. The entire story really wasn't sufficient to support one book let alone three. And the writing was not worth the hype or the sales. This is triple X porn and belongs in an adult bookstore, not on best seller lists or included in the best books of lists.

B008IYOEZM|4.0|I was in such a hurry to see this season of Dexter that I jumped the gun and bought it as a download through Amazon. I was really dissapointed in the quality of the streaming. I had previously bought a season on my ipad which was basically equivalent to viewing the season on a regular DVD in terms of quality and comfort. Watching this on my computer was agony--streaming didn't work or was spotty and the visuals were ruined. I will probably end up buying the season and watching it again on a regular DVD. I definitely won't buy anything that is stored off my computer again.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|I ordered this product to move my old slides that go back 50 years to when my kids were little to my computer.  Having someone else do them would cost a fortune and this is a really great price for a product that does a wonderful job.  I was a little confused by the small manual that came with the machine. Their email is on the manual and I emailed them and what service!!!  I got a CALL, can you believe that and a return email along with a new manual they have out.  Their support is great.  I have come to the conclusion that the only companies that I want to do business with are ones that have good support.  Sam is their support person and so nice.  He told me to call him anytime for help.  That's hard to find these days. What a breath of fresh air.
B00846REIS|2.0|The book was good but it got really annoying that it was so much like 50 shades..it seemed like the author was trying was to hard and in my opinion it was a cheap knock off of 50 shades...

B0086700CM|4.0|awesome game to play when you are bored... but it sometimes lags on me that's why I gave it 4 stars.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I remember this video from when I was a kid and I enjoyed it then.  As an adult I enjoy this Disney production on many levels. I still enjoy the basic kid fun in the video but now I can also enjoy the serious side that is implied. i.e. children orphaned by WW2, the ability of people to make the best of what they have in a harsh situation and finally the fun byplay between Angela Landsbury and David Tomlinson. This is one of Disney's classics and even though the subject is dated it is still timeless.  Enjoy
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|When it first came out & I saw the previews, I wanted to see it. Then reviews started coming out and the general consensus was that it wasn't very good. So, I waited for it to come out of the theaters. I finally watched it the other night, and I wished I had not listened to the negative reviews. It was a good movie. It had its flaws & some slow parts, but even during the slow parts there was great scenery to enjoy! I look forward to the rumored sequels.
0307592731|4.0|I decided to read this book because it had so many great reviews - I have read one other of Oprah's book recommendations and enjoyed it, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I have been backpacking before, albeit it was a short-lived venture.  It at least gave me something to compare to what the Author was talking about as far as the toughness of the hike.  I don't agree with how the Author conducted herself as far as the drug use is concerned - I think that was a bad decision and found it hard for me to believe you're doing heroine one day and a day later your hiking on a physically strenuous long hike the next?  Also hard to believe is that she did it without much if any fear - she said she didn't allow herself to become scared....maybe that was just the remnants of the heroine? Either way, the book was entertaining, and she is a great writer.  She easily conveyed her emotions and her descriptions are intriguing....made me want to maybe hike a portion of the trail some day.  I wish she would follow up a bit more at the end of the book, overall it was a great, interesting read!

B0058YPILY|5.0|I won't go into depth of why I like this show and the synopsis of the episodes, but this review is just for the special features of the Season 7 DVD.  And I'm not sure about Season 6 or the Season 5 DVD, but I know Season 7 does have subtitles.  Oddly enough, it doesn't have closed captioning.  While I was going through the DVDs to find the exact special features I was starting to get let down by the lack of commentaries showing up.  I was hoping it wasn't a typo, but we do get two episodes with commentary.  Weirdly, \\"It Takes a Village\\" and \\"Hit/Run\\" I sure would have gotten a commentary, but alas, no.

B007VTVGFQ|5.0|This truly has to be one of my favorite limited edition packages, the notebook you get with the limited edition brings the album so much closer to you. You feel like you are actually owning fiona's notebook. Lyrics are written in hand by Fiona while artwork as well is her own work.<br /><br />A fantastic way to really feel the album! I don't understand how a digital download can beat owning something like this. Reading lyrics from the notebook while listening to the album is simply magical. Have to say this is not one of my fave Fiona albums, but this special package helped me understand it better.
034580404X|3.0|I don't know what all of the hype was about! I don't think that the books are well written. 1/4 of the books are e-mail conversations that take up the whole page, like the author needed something to fill in the space. I would not buy the books new, like I did! Don't waste your money.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a great kid's movie at a decent price.  I'm guessing all Disney movies are priced a bit higher than others, so I wasn't expecting a fantastic deal here (although it would have been nice!).  The packaging was sufficient and shipping was timely.  No complaints whatsoever.
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|I am a recent fan of Big Big Train, after hearing \\"[[ASIN:B0039WB2GW The Underfall Yard]]\\" for the first time earlier this summer.  When I heard that they would be releasing back-to-back albums in the upcoming months, I was thrilled and couldn't wait to purchase them.  I finally pre-ordered \\"English Electric (Part One)\\" directly from the band.  The MP3s for the album were available on 9/1/2012, and I spent an afternoon listening, and re-listening to the album.  All I can say is - it's one of the best albums that I have heard in the last 20 years, if not ever.  The songwriting and musicianship are amazing, in particular on \\"Judas Unrepentant\\".<br /><br />I can't wait for Part Two to be released in early 2013!
0439023513|3.0|As a former philosophy professor, I must say that I loved The Hunger Games and Catching Fire for many reasons.  First of all, The Hunger Games portrayed a convincing interpretation of a Hobbesian \\"State of Nature\\" (a war of all against all, in which life is nasty, brutish, and short) that could be right at home in any political philosophy course.  In addition, the very concept of The Hunger Games (the actual event in the arena) is filled with such irresistible existential horror that the reader cannot help but be drawn in to confront his or her own mortality (and sense of objective morality).  And the second novel in the series, Catching Fire, takes a proven story concept (the games) and perverts it even further, in a satisfying way, by requiring participation from previous Hunger Games victors.<br /><br />However, despite the many virtues of the first two novels in the series, Mockingjay falls flat because of a fundamental flaw.  Instead of presenting a new variation on a proven theme (games in the arena), Mockingjay offers a very ordinary and predictable post-apocalyptic rebellion plot that could have occurred in any other story from this genre.  Politics and war action replace the gloriously macabre existential moment of standing on the pedestal during the countdown to the start of the games.<br /><br />Although the trilogy is now complete, I hope that Suzanne Collins reads this review before writing a Hunger Games prequel.  There is still a good story to be told: the very first Hunger Games and how this satisfyingly twisted world (and the Hunger Games event in particular) came to be.  Please return to the heart of the series, and its namesake: the actual Hunger Games themselves, which are the heart of everything unique and interesting about this world and its characters.

0307594165|5.0|Toni Morrison has done it again- written a deceptively simple, short but nevertheless, full freighted book. I just read Home twice back-to-back. At first it didn't move me until I came to the end and then it moved me so much I immediately read it again (this is often my pattern with TM; I need the first reading to get into her rhythm and poetry and discern the plot and the 2nd to do the necessary close reading).<br /><br />In this novella there are really only two main characters: Frank Money and his sister Cee, supported and/or wounded by a cast of living and dead Samaritans and evil doers. It takes place during or just after the Korean War and \\"home\\" is Lotus, Georgia- first described as a mind- numbing town to be fled and last as a soul soothing refuge. Frank, a none too well young war veteran, is trying to return cross country to save his sister from an unknown dire situation. On this journey  (which has a sense of the Underground Railroad about it), TM examines the concept of \\"home'. Within Lotus and on the way back to it, we meet different kinds of homes: ones that are open; ones that are closed; ones that beg to be left or returned to; ones not owned or ones full of possessiveness, ones overflowing with abuse and ones overflowing with love.<br /><br />Home is an everyman kind of book in the sense that it is about the deep emptiness that comes from not having a \\" home\\"- a place where one can be loved or accepted, nurtured or forgiven. This is so much the central metaphor that if one does not read carefully or is not familiar with author Toni Morrison's evocation of the black experience, one may overlook its ascription of racial identity or racial discrimination. For instance, the color of a character's skin is never mentioned and there is little dialect. Still that experience pervades and underpins the action. On my 2nd reading, instances of racial discrimination, glossed over the first time, popped out  (like in a tour through a Halloween haunted house) and then were quickly reabsorbed into the background as the story and the characters moved on while the hurt and sometimes savagery rumbled beneath the surface.<br /><br />And then there are the violent scenes- two of the most horrific since Beloved, and manageable only because both are referenced obliquely, i.e. neither happens in present time. One is an act of cowardice fueled by fear and anger that we've come to recognize during the unwinnable wars that we wage and the other is an act of bravery and love in an unwinnable situation fueled by cruelty and racial hatred. This latter is a \\"Sophie's Choice\\" but the telling of it allows the slowly healing protagonist, Frank Money, to confess his own past to the author he has been resisting and to perform an act of contrition that one senses will be his saving grace. It also brings the book back to its beginning.<br /><br />Home is an excellent book in which the brave people are buried beneath beloved trees and guardian angels wear zoot suits and men and women can stand tall again. Since it will probably be 4 more years till her next book, I will read it a 3rd and 4th time.<br />Jennifer Williams
B0006HC0I2|5.0|A rare great standout foreign (Euro) film. This is maybe the best Euro film I've ever seen. The story moves along well though slower than USA films. It has the highest quality production values. Actually has a well done action scene toward the end.    This comment comes from a person who doesn't share the \\"its great since it's a foreign film\\" attitude. I am also not one of those that say any foreign film is good and then down rate the reviews of those complaining about the terrible foreign films rated as good.    In most foreign films you have to \\"put up with much boredom\\" before you get to the little good in them. But this film, while being slow by USA standards, is what all foreign films should be, slow yet fast enough to not \\"die\\" on you before the next important event.    The lead character catches the POST WWII Euro HEART and value system perfectly. Stolen money from high socialist taxes or just directly stolen from the bank, is as good as earned money. A mistress on the side. Friends you love. It satisfies the desire for a free ride in life that never ends. Ah the easy life....

0525953728|1.0|I find it highly suspect for someone to write a book that is supposed to be a true account when there is no one to either back up or dispute his account and he probably counted on that. His fellow team members (who he has betrayed) cannot dispute his story without revealing who they are so how do we know he is telling the truth?

0425166805|5.0|Chariots of the Gods is a book needing little introduction.  The ideas introduced here launched author von D&auml;niken to a certain degree of fame (and infamy) around the world.  The concept of alien gods intervening in the early development of man would live on for decades in the numerous books, films, and documentaries that would follow.<br /><br />Having been first published over four decades ago, there are parts of Chariots which have not aged well.  Some bits are downright depressing: It turns out that not only did we fail to land on Mars by 1986, as was once a \\"certainty,\\" but we've seemingly given up the quest entirely.  The writer's optimism toward man's progress, anchored in the early achievements of the space age, simply did not align with a future written by politicians and tax payers.  That said, despite becoming dated, a discussion of technology was essentially unavoidable given the nature of the material.<br /><br />If I have one fault to find with the writing, it would be that the author tends to dwell on the refusal of the scientific community to consider his proposals.  He tells us, continuously, how historical dogma is accepted without questioning, and how we must not be closed minded to alternatives.  It's hard to fault the man, as he was essentially predicting (rather accurately) the shunning and dismissal his writing would receive in scientific circles.  Still, as the reader, I'm already effectively committed as his audience, and I don't find it entirely necessary to beat the poor horse quite so badly.<br /><br />A note about production quality: The mass market paperback is a bit disappointing.  The pictures, in particular, are almost impossible to view.  But I guess you get what you pay for, and that does not reflect the overall quality of the source material.<br /><br />Ultimately I highly recommend this book.  The key, I think, is to focus on the questions posed in the content, rather than the conclusions.  It's the questions which are fascinating, and it's the questions which, more often than not, continue to stand the test of time.  How did ancient civilizations query and transport boulders so massive they would challenge even modern machinery?  For what purpose were giant structures and drawings that could only be viewed from space?  Why did religions spanning the physical earth, and without regular contact with one another, share such similar stories of origin?  How did ancient cartographers gain knowledge of seemingly \\"undiscovered\\" lands, and ancient astronomers of planets and galaxies only recently observed with modern optics?<br /><br />It's amazing how little we know about our own past.  Whether or not one is able to buy in to the proposal of visitation by extraterrestrial intelligences being a plausible conclusion, any sufficiently curious person should be taken in by the mysteries which modern doctrine tends to gloss over.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I truly believe that your imangination is better than any movie, t.v. show ect...I think these books are by farther better than the series, but I do like the show as well, but the books are by far better. The books were in wonderful condition and package well. I love them very much!!
1476712042|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />I know a lot of people had mixed feelings about this book, and people either loved it or hated it, but I was definitely one of the one's who loved this story!! Yes the love was a bit crazy and dramatic but I found myself so invested in the story and the characters that I couldn't get enough of it, in fact I listened to the audiobook on my commute to and from work, and found myself sitting in my car a half an hour after I got home because I wanted to know what would happen next.<br /><br />The thing I loved the most about this book was most definitely the characters, I found myself invested in all the characters not just one. Abby and Travis were both super-loveable characters although Travis took a while to warm up too. America and Shepley were charming as well and I even loved The Maddox Boys, and not to mention Finch. The characters made this story so enthralling, and I found myself wanting more and more from the story.<br /><br />The storyline moved along quickly and I never felt bored with the story, I also thought the girl who narratted the book brought a lot to the story, and didn't take away from it as sometimes a bad narrator in my opinion can do. I could see how people could have issues with the romance in this book, it moves incredibly fast, and while it's not the typical YA insta-love scenerio, it still progressed extremely quick, but for me it worked because I was so invested into the characters.<br /><br />I know Jamie McGuire is writing a second book in this series from the point of view of Travis, and I almost wish it was a sequel in the respect that It continued on the story vs. retelling the story, I feel like we got Travis' point of view a lot in this story, and have mixed feelings what else the second book can bring to the table, but I am excited for it non-the-less.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I received a kindle edition of this book as a gift and was almost going to return it but am glad I didn't. I actually really enjoyed it and would give \\"Cinder\\" 3.5 stars but I'll round up. As the title may reveal, this is a retelling of the fairy tale Cinderella, one where Cinder is actually a cyborg. I like reading re-tellings of classic fairy tales and this was no exception. The plot was unique and the characters engaging. Cinder was not at all a damsel in distress. This Cinderella was sarcastic, likable and an independent cyborg. You really end up rooting for Cinder and she's an excellent heroine. The Prince wasn't bad either. Kai, \\"prince charming,\\" was also likable and, well, charming. Supporting characters like Iko the android were also well developed and engaging. Many of the characters kept the book engaging and lighthearted at times. The pace was also pretty fast. I read the book quickly enough.<br /><br />The only downside do this book was the predictability. I think by around fifty pages in, you know EXACTLY what's going to happen. I don't think Meyer could have been anymore blunt which is why a star and a half was docked off. There is literally a few pages where the back story, which needs to be told but not so obviously, is slapping your face, letting you know what's going to happen.<br /><br />Despite that, I really did enjoy the book. Meyer has excellent prose and the characters are wonderfully developed. I'm looking forward to the next book!
1451648537|5.0|Valuable insight into a man full of contradictions. The book, especially toward the end, may go overboard in singing his praises, noting his products' humongous influence on modern life as we know it, but doesn't short change us on getting to know the dark side of its subject. He abandoned his first child, then named a computer after her, then denied the name had anything to do with the estranged daughter. When his company offered him stock options, he said he'd rather have a private jet, so they gave him both, then he complained that he wanted more of those stock options he initially said he didn't want at all. He's wired differently, and getting to know him in these pages made me wonder what the true luck-to-genius ratio was in his formula for success. Some of his early battles/decisions were just plain wrong. If he hadn't given in to Wozniak on adding expansion slots to the Apple ][, the product that launched the company probably would have bombed out of the gate. It's even mentioned how the Macintosh sales fizzled after the hype died down and he seemed to be floundering at the company in that period before he was ousted. Jobs's phenomenal success upon his return made him bulletproof from then on. Let him act like a d-bag because he's a genius. It's telling that his tendency to dismiss whatever he didn't feel like dealing with would lead to his demise. Cancer cells can't be swayed to kneel before him by fun iProducts.<br /><br />My one real complaint about the book is that by the iPhone era, the biographer explains the virtues of closed systems (Jobs's preference) over open systems (Bill Gates's preference) way more times than necessary, even drawing comparisons to the integrated approach to health care Jobs received in Memphis versus the less effective treatment he underwent later at Stanford, to the point where the book begins to sound more like an advertisement for Apple than the otherwise fair and balanced biography it started out as. Part of this discrepancymight be because the latter parts of the book are describing current product lines the company is still selling, as opposed to the historical record of products we're now only able to look back on. That aside, this is still a great biography.

B007KZY1YY|2.0|Two and a half stars.  Yet more of the same okayish book.  The major problem I have with it is the portrayal of Ana as a simpering useless woman who essentially defers everything to Grey's judgement.  She is not a strong woman but one who thinks that being allowed friends is an achievement in standing up for herself! Not a particularly good heroine or role model.
1597801585|5.0|This is a very well-written, extremely entertaining book.  It twists, it turns, and it provides a rich backdrop into which many, many more books might find themselves.

B0073SO0PI|5.0|This book was an epiphany for me as I reached adulthood and found I wasn't prepared to deal with personal relationships in an \\"adult\\" and responsible manor. Learning to think and express myself in realistic and literal terms got me started to \\"live\\" a literal and realistic life and \\"see\\" things as they were, not as exaggerated melodramas. I was able to see that unfortunate events were just that, not life altering or life-ending (breaking up with a girlfriend or not getting a job I had wanted). Much like another book, \\"The Four Agreements\\", but with Dyer's book was much more accessible to me and gave me the information to start my journey towards a reality based existence. I have given and recommended this book to dozens of other people who were having troubles and could not imagine a normal or satisfying life after some event left them wandering in self-doubt and fear.[[ASIN:B000HP0NSM YOUR ERRONEOUS ZONES]]

0143105426|5.0|\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"<br /><br />That's probably one of the most famous opening sentences of a novel, along with Moby Dick. Pride and Prejudice is also probably one of Jane Austen's most famous novels. I certainly liked it much more than Northanger Abbey. It is the story of Elizabeth Bennet, who lives with five sisters, and an odd pair of parents at Longbourn. Her mother is constantly scheming about marrying off her daughters to wealthy young men, so when Netherfield Park is let to the rich Mr. Bingley, she is very excited indeed. (Mr. Bennet's estate will be entailed away from the immediate family upon his death, so at least one of the sisters has to marry well to provide for them.) And Mr. Bingley brings his very proud friend, Mr. Darcy. The book is about the courtships, and, of course, has many twists and turns. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham, and I suppose, the detestable Mr. Collins (who the estate will be entailed to) are the main men of the story.<br /><br />I really loved this one; it had humor and wit in it, and great characters. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet and his sarcasm very much, though Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are really too silly sometimes. So stupid. And of course, Elizabeth. She is really a very smart and spirited young woman, who will not be ordered around. I also watched the 1995 TV series from BBC, and I must confess, Mr. Darcy...never mind.<br /><br />Anyway, all the characters were well portrayed, and while the TV series is wonderful, it doesn't quite have the subtlety of the conversations in Pride and Prejudice itself. The TV series did have excellent casting though; all the Bennets, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Collins were portrayed very well. (Yes, I suppose this is sort of a double review.) I would say though, that Caroline Bingley should have been a little prettier; she was just hideous, and Mr. Bingley was kind of silly-looking. But everywhere else, they did very well.<br /><br />Back to the book. As I said, there were many twists and turns which made this one a thoroughly enjoyable read. And really great characters. Though she is certainly less descriptive and florid than Dickens, Austen still manages in this one, to portray everyone extremely well. Mr. Collins really is detestable, Bingley overly-cheerful and positive, and Darcy stiff and stern (though he has his reasons, of course.) Mrs. Bennet is an extremely foolish woman, as is Lydia, the youngest Bennet. The pride and prejudice of the story refer, I believe, to Mr. Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice (though it is certainly debatable.) Mr. Darcy is very proud indeed at the beginning of the story, and Elizabeth's prejudice prevents her from seeing his true character for a while.<br /><br />I will just add that I read the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition from 2009, and while it has a very nice design, it does not have any analysis or introduction, so if you want that you'd be better off reading the Penguin Classics regular edition or Oxford World Classics. However, my Penguin Classics Deluxe edition arrived slightly damaged on the spine, which was a disappointment.<br /><br />[...]

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|One of my favorite books! Travis is definitely a guy that in real life we as women should run away from, but since it's not real life, he is irresistible! There parts of this book that I felt didn't belong or could have been omitted, but I could not put it down. I have reread this book multiple times. Can't wait for the next one!
B00884GR0W|5.0|It's just like minecraft for computer but it has realistic graphics and if you aren't sure about buying this game try block story lite but trust me this game is fun.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|the movie was not exactly like the book and there where a few scenes that i did not like but still a good movie
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I loved the entire movie.  It keep me on the seat of my pants and nothing was anticipated.  Very suspenseful.  Only hint of romance came at the end of the movie.  A little of everything in this movie.  Nice balance.  Adult only content.
B000059GEI|5.0|A classic musical from the Golden Age. Merman...Monroe. Need I say more?  It is worth it just to hear Merman again and in Technicolor.
0307341577|3.0|I read Dark Places because I first read Gone Girl and absolutely loved it. LOVED IT. Then, I read her other book, Sharp Objects, which I liked too, but not as much as Gone Girl. Finally, I read this one and apparently I read them in descending order. Wasn't a huge fan of this one. As many others have said, it's depressing, but that's not even why I didn't like it. It felt disconnected. I didn't love any of the characters, the ending wasn't that crazy of a climax and it all sort of felt \\"blah\\" to me. I would definitely recommend the other books I mentioned above, though.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|if you liked this game in the past your going love the game now. glu has updated this game and it is worth a download and a good look at. your. car has a life bar so you are not out after first mistake.
0525953728|5.0|PLOT: Navy Seal Team get Bin Laden~~<br /><br />Mark Owen is a Pseudo~ to protect his identity. This starts as his facination and desire to become a seal. ONLY the Elite become a Navy SEAL and SEAL TEAM 6 the anti-terrorist of the SEALS get into the squad. He uses the PHRASE TEXT book to become both physically and mentally tough to enter the team. AS the team train all over the world from Australia to the USA to Afghanistan. This starts a little slow but builds once we get into the MISSION of going into take out Bin Laden. The details and mission are explained are first rate. I give this 5 STARS for the mission alone. It also clears up inaccurate FACTS reported by the press about the mission both before and after. This is a fast read and takes about 5 hours. BETTER than I ever expected. Owens explains that before the book was published an independant expert was hired to VERIFY that restricted military info was NOT included in the book and all details about SEALS and the mission were available before the book was published and could be found on the internet, books or newspapers. WHAT adds to the story is the FACE of a seal who gives his slant on HISTORY and the real life bio of the secret side of a NAVY SEAL~ 5 STARS~ BETTER THAN EXPECTED.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|It was ok for a night without expectation.  This movie just didn't do it for me.  I will keep it for another night to watch when nothing else seems to fit.  Not that this movie would.  But it was better than watching fuzz on the screen.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|I don't know what's up with all the negative reviews.If your going to sit, watch and compare it to Rocky your being ridiculous. This movie is great from start to finish and the story line is brilliant. The ending was emotional and intense. I had to order a dvd copy for myself and I think i'm going to watch it again. Like right now!!
B0064W652A|5.0|Hush was once again a stellar addition to the Batman franchise. The characters were rich and complex, the art work was amazing. The story line itself was well written and thoughtful. Highly recommend this to any Batman enthusiast.
B0013ND30M|4.0|It's a classic Disney movie.  My 3 year old son loves Maleificent, the Dragon at the end of the movie.  It's a good movie overall.
B0068THAGY|5.0|SUPER 8 was many things: a father/son estrangement drama, a puppy-love romance, an ode to the cultish B-movies of the 70s, an ensemble coming-of-age piece, the lot of which flavored with sci-fi seasoning. Above all, I think, this is an homage to the disappearing Creature-Feature genre. J. J. Abrams' alien is beautifully and meticulously rendered in seamless CG. We are permitted the occasional glimpse -- a hand, a leg -- more and more of the unique form offering up pieces of itself as the story progresses. The small tastes continue to tease us until finally, during the last 20 minutes, we are rewarded with an animal quite unlike anything we've seen, or even dared to imagine, before. This is not M. Night's SIGNS, in which the final reveal of the antagonizing extra-terrestrials appears to be little more than a man in green spandex. In SUPER 8, everything from the arrangement of the beastie's limbs to its peculiar form of locomotion are, quite frankly, alien. Kudos to whoever designed it.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the pace of SUPER 8, but the \\"dragging\\" plot seems to me like a conscious decision on the part of the director. I believe Abrams intentionally employed that 70s style of movie-making, harkening back to a time before the advent of the MTV quick-cut, (a visual style created either for or by [a chicken/egg dilemma] ADHA sufferers with severely limited attention-spans). This movie is not for Generation Ritalin; I suspect that viewers over the age of 30 will have no problem sitting through the 1 hour 51 minutes.<br /><br />All of the kid actors are impressive, but Elle Fanning is particularly superb. She has a a characteristic, silent-movie manner, so that more than tears pour from her eyes: the entirety of what Fanning is feeling emanates from them as well. Some other reviewers have criticized the harsh language of our young protagonists, but they are meant to be middle school students and are therefore at that age during which they're desperately trying to broadcast their budding maturity; peppering their speech with expletives is one traditional method -- I remember doing this myself at age 12, cursing like a sailor because I was sure that was how \\"real\\" adults spoke.<br /><br />I'd say my only true criticism would concern my disbelief in the ability of a pick-up truck to completely derail a massive, speeding train while sustaining only passenger-side damage and leaving the driver alive. Other than that, SUPER 8 was super great. This movie is what would have happened if E.T. had been captured by government agents and subjected to a decade of torturous experimentation, so that by the time he broke out, the once lovable little extra-terrestrial would have become decidedly less cuddly -- munching on humans like celery sticks as he works away (I won't tell you what he's building, you'll have to watch and discover that for yourself). And even though this premise has been done many times before, it was nonetheless masterfully executed, resulting in a beautiful depiction of a familiar, yet fantastic tale.<br /><br />SUPER 8: an oldie, but a goody.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this puts me out every night this is worth 5 dollars this is a steal I love this app so much buy it
B0087IT8FK|4.0|Inspired by the true events, \\"The Intouchables\\" follow the friendship between Philippe (François Cluzet), a quadriplegic millionaire, and Driss (Omar Sy), his new caregiver from a Paris slum. Despite (or because of) the differences in their social backgrounds and the fact that very outspoken Driss has no previous experience of caregiving, Philippe hires Driss, who helps Philippe sort out the deeper problems of his life.<br /><br />But make no mistake about this. \\"The Intouchables\\" is a comedy, though its approach is understated. The theme may be serious, but the film itself is free from seriousness that would have weighed down the whole movie. \\"The Intouchables\\" will not spend time in saying what is obvious. There is no overdramatizing in the script. You will hear no preachy messages. Instead of them, you will follow the simple story of two credible characters the directors team Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano have successfully created: Philippe and Driss.<br /><br />I for one thought the film would be more effective with shorter running time (the opening car chase sequence seems unnecessary). Also, I wanted to know more about some of the supporting characters, especially Philippe's secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot), with whom Driss flirts.<br /><br />Still, \\"The Intouchables\\" is engaging and compelling throughout, thanks to the nuanced performances from the leads. The film became a huge box-office hit in France, the third most commercially successful film in that country's movie history (after \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis\\") and it is not a surprising thing at all.
B006O7XOOW|3.0|The Ballcano only has one trick- you place the balls on top, and they roll down the sides. My daughter is 14 months, and seems mostly to just push down the center part to make it make the volcano noise, and hasn't really mastered putting the light-weight plastic balls back on top of the toy to make it \\"work\\" right, but she does seem to enjoy just pushing it and hearing the noise.<br />For the amount of space it takes up, though, the Fisher-Prive Rocktivity station offers so many moer activities and learning opportunities, and, for that matter, was MUCH easier to set up!
1466401885|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book!  I soooo hope there will be a sequel!  I have heard there will be a book called 'Walking Disaster' told from Travis' point of view in 2013; can't wait!
1451627297|1.0|I have read most of SK's books and I'm a fan. But not this time he has not caught the feel of the time and at over 700 pages it's way too long and as a result slow and boring. I hate to admit it but by far the best fact/fiction JFK book has just been written by a young Brit called Dan McQuade. Call him SK maybe he could edit yours down to around 250 pages for you then it might have some bite and try to remember what they tell actors Less Is More.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|neat game. like it a lot as long as it stays free! my kids will love it! thank u a lot
1476712042|5.0|Realistic storyline with passion & lust!<br /><br />I'm a new reader, started with the \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" series which drew me into wanting to read more. I was extremely engaged in this book and didn't want to put it down. The book had angry humor which made the desire more appealing to read. I loved the fact that the \\"plot\\" of the book began early in the first few chapters and developed from there.<br /><br />The reviews were helpful to me so I wanted to provide mine.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a very addictive game. I wonder if it is available to play on facebook. the best game I have played thus far.
0062059882|2.0|Interesting concept, nice style of writing but it starts slow, very, very slowly.  Sure it picked up speed a while through but overall I still didn't love it. I simply didn't care about what happend to Shadow, Laura or Odin - none the characters weren't truly developed, nor did I feel that many of the plots were.  I had expected a truly brilliant ending for all those 'empty' pages but it never came.<br /><br />I think I need to stop reading highly recommended books.  My expectations are too high...
B008XG1X18|5.0|finally!!!  absolutely  love this app . easy to use.  makes repining a lot easier. definitely worth 5 stars . my favorite app.
0525953728|1.0|Never thought I would see a SEAL sell out for a fast buck.  Covert operations need to stay classified, there will be a next time.  The National security of America  is paramount.  I'm delighted that Bin Laden is dead, hope Mitt wins in November.
1609613937|5.0|This book was really interesting read but the best part is when you take on the challenge to see for yourself.  I've been following the book for a week now and I've lost about 5lbs, one entire dress size and about 2 inches from my waist. I don't even want to call this a diet because it isn't, it's a way of life.  Just follow the instructions in his book and you will see the results.  So easy to follow!  It does take some time to adjust to a pretty much vegan diet but you feel amazing everyday. I haven't felt tired all week.  Exercise is really important.  I run about 3 miles every morning and play about 2-3 hours of tennis at least 4 times a week, so I'm losing weight effortlessly.  But my aunt is also doing this lifestyle change without much exercise and she has lost close to 4lbs now. Buy the book and see for yourself, good luck!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game. where's my water was awesome this is a great addition to it. I hope you guys keep updating soon
0345535421|5.0|If it's possible, A Clash of Kings was even better than Game of Thrones. I raced through it, intent on seeing what would happen next.
B005K17RU0|4.0|So far, I am really impressed with this app!  I had no idea that I could get/use 'APPS' on my Kindle Fire.....this is just SOOOOO COOOOOOOOL!<br />Thanks again, Amazon!
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Love Love Love Chuck. Witty, sexy, dramatic, it is a Great show for the whole family to enjoy.... So sad it only lasted 5 season.
0061726834|3.0|What kind of cliff hanger ending was that? Arghhhhhh, gawd, I'm dying here. My fingers ache from clinging to the pages, my head is pounding from the adrenaline from that final chase and my heart is sore...for Alex.<br /><br />It took me a good 180 pages to get into the story. I considered putting it down and picking something up a little more interesting. Something with a kick ass heroine, a sexy sarcastic hero and lots of sass, drama and action, but I didn't. I figured that 45,353 odd people had rated it and with an average of 4.07 stars, the majority enjoyed it, I could at least finish it.<br /><br />The beginning was slow. So slow[...] I felt that Lena was almost like a robot. She didn't think for herself, was scared of thinking for herself. She was grey like her favorite colour. Nothing she thought, said or did was noticeable. She just blended in. I started to get into this dynastopian world once she was bitten by a psycho flesh loving dog. It was enough to wake her up & smell the dog poop. Open her eyes to colour. Life in Portland was built on a lie. Everything she had thought she knew. Lie. Love a disease? Lie.<br /><br />Enter Alex. Swoooon. With hair the colour of autumn leaves he swept Alex off her feel and opened her eyes to the weird ass community they lived survived in. He made her reconsider her fear of love and the pain it would bring. To me, Alex was fearless. Brave. And selfless.<br /><br />A lot of the book was world building and I have mentioned before, sometimes it gets a little bit boring for me. I can only read so many adjectives sentence after sentence before my eyes start to glaze over. Fortunately the second half of the book redeemed it for me. I didn't want to put it down, I wanted to know more about the new Lena, learn more about Alex and bask in that easy friendship that Lena & Hana shared. I wanted to hear Gracie talk & talk and talk. I wanted to find Lena's mum and hug her and ease her pain, if only for a minute. I wanted so many things.<br /><br />In the end...I got heartbreak, and a massive big stupid ending which makes me wanna cry. I know it's probably not what everyone is thinking, but I also know that it is going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better. If you know what I mean. *Cough* for Alex *Cough*<br /><br />I really want to go straight onto Pandemonium, but from the reviews I have scoured, I know that one ends on an even bigger cliffy and I just don't think my heart could take that right now. So until February 2013...<br /><br />\\"I love you. Remember. They can not take it.\\"
B003H4I4JU|1.0|Considering that Ender's game is one of the best loss of innocence through conflict books I have ever read, I expected a great follow up. If you are looking for another fantastic book, this is not it. It was confusing and the plot was very murky at times and also that it was written in almost a different style disappointed me.
044655667X|4.0|Yes, he is. He is also a superb courtroom tactician. Would Connelly himself have been that good in these circumstances? Whatever, he is that good a mouthpiece for Mickey Haller. I wished his half-brother Hieronymous Bosch had been on for more than a wordless visit one evening. That would have injected more human aspects of his life, but I'll take what I can get. Mickey is set for a big change after his experiences in this murder case. I look forward to that day.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I typically do not read fiction, but I picked this up while on vacation and found it to be very captivating. I have read the second book, and am almost finished with the third. This first is by far the best in my opinion.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I use this ap on my Kindle Fire and it works great!  No complaints.  So much easier to use Pinerest via the new ap vs. logging on through the Internet on the Kindle.  That didn't work so well.
B008N1LL42|2.0|While perusing Instant Video on my PS3 this weekend I saw two movies that I thought would be cool. So on Friday night we did Battleship and on Saturday we did [[ASIN:B005LAIGZU Act of Valor]]. And what a difference! With one you get suckered by stupidness and with the other you get captivated by awesomeness.<br /><br />Director Peter Berg recently did an excellent superhero movie with Will Smith called [[ASIN:B001F76PDS Hancock]]. So when I saw that Berg would be at the helm of Hasbro's Battleship, based on the trailers, I thought we'd get a cool military movie that focused on the Navy and how it would handle an alien invasion. However, what Berg delivered with Battleship was a hokey, corny, unrealistic dud. I almost walked out of my own home theater.<br /><br />On the other hand, fledgling Directors Mike McCoy & Scott Waugh come up with the unique concept of casting a group of real Navy SEALs in a story about fighting terrorists, and they deliver a powerful, realistic, emotional thrill ride of a military film.<br /><br />So if we break out some of the important elements of both films, let's see how they fare against each other:<br /><br />Battleship Story: 1 star - A cool Sci-fi/military concept turned into silliness by goofball, slow-moving side stories and disastrous attempts at humor.<br />Act of Valor Story: 5 stars - A serious, action packed military film based on true events of the heroism of US soldiers that have to rescue an abducted op and take out a terrorist.<br /><br />Battleship Acting Talent: 2 stars - Taylor Kitsch (John Carter), Alexander Skarsgård (True Blood) and Rihanna (Really? Rihanna???) corn up the screen with unbelievable portrayals of men and women who fight for our country.<br />Act of Valor Acting Talent: 5 stars - U.S. Navy SEALs and U.S. Navy Special Warfare Combatant Crewmen show audiences their stripes and make you think that your watching real life Black Ops events captured on camera.<br /><br />Battleship Action: 3 stars - When the actors aren't hamming up the screen, the action is not bad, but unfortunately there's way too much hamming up the screen.<br />Act of Valor Action: 5 stars - Even the short amount of time at the beginning of the movie that is spent introducing you to the heroes that will star in the film moves along due to the underlying tone of something big about to happen. Then when the real action starts, it's intense.<br /><br />Battleship FX: 3 stars - Okay, Battleship's FX weren't bad, but even the main alien craft had a hokeyness to it as it looked like some kind of Transformer-bot instead of a lean, mean, alien fighting machine.<br />Act of Valor FX: 4 stars - Act of Valor is not an FX movie, but the use of current battlefield technology is awesome to observe in action.<br /><br />Average stars for Battleship: 2.25<br />Average stars for Act of Valor: 4.75<br /><br />Hands down: If you've not had the opportunity to see either of these movies and you're here looking for something to order on Instant Video (or put into you DVD player), stay away from Battleship and add Act of Valor to your cart/queue.actors aren't hamming up the screen, the action is not bad, but unfortunately there's way too much hamming up the screen.<br />Act of Valor Action: 5 stars - Even the short amount of time at the beginning of the movie that is spent introducing you to the heroes that will star in the film moves along due to the underlying tone of something big about to happen.

031620157X|5.0|An adorable story that was exceedingly well written. Chris Colfer really impressed me with his imagination and how he perfectly he carried on all of the classic fairy tales that I grew up loving. A great, quick read for any age group. I'd recommend this book to anyone.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Great Story line. Well written. Well acted. Well directed. If you liked the first Sherlock Homes movie starring Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law, your going to like this one even more. The interplay between the actors is awesome. The special effects are right on. Hope we see more from this group.
B000I3PERS|5.0|I actually bought this for our out-of-state grown son after our family trip to Scotland. He said after being there and seeing the Wallace Monument and Sterling Castle, he wanted to see the movie again. This is a classic, albeit a disturbing and violent one!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has been very helpful.  I am very demanding of my droid, and it's battery.  This has helped me to know what my battery is capable of at any given level of battery life.  I am seriously thinking about buying the &quot;pro&quot; version.
B004EARTN8|1.0|I watched about 15 minutes of it and probably didnt miss anything. Watched a little bit of beginning, middle and end. There is just nothing to keep you pulled in the movie. Big disappointment.

0525953728|1.0|A book by a man who dishonored his country and his rank for a few dollars. He should be ashamed...and shouldn't be supported.

B007T2XC7A|4.0|I've always been a fan of Norah Jones. What can I say... she puts me in a good mood. When I heard about her newest album, and that she was working with Danger Mouse on it, I was super excited. I am very pleased with the results - there's more of an electric-vibe to her voice and more rock tones than even \\"The Fall.\\" The combination of recording and Norah's sultry voice result in a fun, relaxed album that mixes different genres so well you'd think it was natural.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It works as stated and I have had no issues with its use. Gives good information without being intrusive.  I would recommend it.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|We were glad to see Senna when it was showing at the Violet Crown in Austin.  This documentary is awesome and we decided we had to own our own copy.  Our friends came over to watch and they loved it as well, though none of us are Formula 1 fans.  The actual video footage of Ayrton Senna, both personal and professional, is heart-wrenching and the film is so well constructed that it becomes much more than just a story about a Formula 1 driver.  It's a story of a gifted but humble man, who had faith and persevered against all odds to accomplish extraordinary things.  He was devoted to his family and his country and they were devoted to him.  He was brilliant, charismatic, and passionate about his sport.  Asif Kapadia has created a truly stunning documentary about a truly extraordinary man.  Watch this film - you won't regret it!

B005LAII58|3.0|more entertaining as compard to the first......I do agree with the comments mentioned at amazon webshops.....as director behind the scene, a little exposure about the method is the action done is continuous which when seen by the eye could tell that it is more of action pack film which would looks much better...rather than a lame action as there are many action film being commended online. I think and feel that this is a better choice in terms of this film ehich would bring more enjoyment and entertainment to people at its peek points. I will in fact work more with Stallone to get even much better in the next episode of expendables called expendables 3......watch out for this next film which is likely to be available.<br /><br />Written by:<br /><br />Ang Poon Kah<br />Director Ron Howard for film Da Vinci Code.

B000SLP4SE|5.0|Gripping, thrilling, fast moving and most of all enjoyable.  I really loved this movie.  You won't be disappointed if you like fast-paced, action type movies.

B005LAIHPY|4.0|I was prepared to hate this movie but did not.  The Transformers movies were so bad and made no sense what so ever I thought surely Mike Bay would do this movie the same and well actually is also makes no sense what so ever.  The characters are likeable though unlike the Transformers.  I liked everyone.  I give stars based on five things directing (no star), acting (star), writing (star), effects (star), costume and make up (star).  So everything was good save the director so it's worth seeing.  Spoiler:  True there is no way aliens who can fold time and space would arrive here with a stupid sat tracking system like ours and be dead in the water literally.  I think if the aliens were less high tech and they were given an objective like \\"We need your water\\" it would have been better.

B00785P2QC|5.0|I love to play the G5 simulated building games. Virtual City Playground is my favorite of all of them! I recommend this game to people of all ages.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book is real photon trash.  Sorry to say I read it any way just to see what happens in the end.  Don't see how the girl can walk after all that.  How can they make this a movie?

B008LD4126|4.0|I was so happy to hear that Elbow had a new album out. My only fear is that they would fall back into that Americanized sound from Badly Drawn Boy. I love the mix of A.D. music and British pop from the first four albums and I truly missed that sound. Thank goodness there was material left in the volt from their previous work . Hopefully this band will stick to it's British roots because as an American I get bored easily.
B006JJBFK0|5.0|Manuela is an outstanding singer and fronted this band perfectly. She handled all the songs very professionally. I love the slower numbers and I look forward to more songs from this singer in the near future.
B00932A6G4|4.0|Things I liked about this film:<br /><br />The CG is very well done.<br /><br />It captured the 'total war' essence of the first movie.<br /><br />The pace of the movie is relentless; once the action begins, it never slows down.<br /><br />Things I didn't like about this film:<br /><br />The script, while good for what it is, doesn't capture the full feel of the culture of the first movie. Interesting in and of itself.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALLERT!)<br /><br />Allmost all the new charicters, most of them very interesting, die. If the creators of this film plan on makeing a sequel, I'd have liked to see more of them survive.
B00846REIS|5.0|I liked Bared To You much better than 50 Shades. I thought this book was much more sensual than having pain come into play when something is suppose to feel good!
B0063HC7EQ|5.0|So enjoyable to read, it just flows, yet takes you through some pretty deep philosophy on the way.  It's like my 'comfort book' :)
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I stood 5 metres from where Maria & the boys were performing that night in Perth and Maria announced the new album Blood for release later this year and did a rendition of the new song blood. The official video gave a better representation and finally the album is just a killer. Overall the songs are outstanding and what is expected of ITM. The only regret is Maria did not get to sign my cd sleeves that fateful night. With four official albums now, the fans are looking forward to a live DVD in the near future. So Maria? Get cracking!! Horns up, metal is my religion.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book loved it til the end. It kept me guessing and surpiaed me all the time which is something that not many books do anymore
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I Recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch the most explosive action pack movie of 2012(BATTLESHIP).The battle for Earth begins at sea.An international naval coalition becomes the world's last hope for survival as they engage a hostile alien force of unimaginable strength,Ripping across the sea,sky and land.Starring Liam Neeson,Rhianna...The best movie I've seen all year...You'll be at the edge of your seat.

B008XG1X18|4.0|Great, great app!!! Freezes sometimes, but dose make Pinterest easier, funnier, better to use. Love,  love this app,  very fun!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely adore Pinterest. I think they need to name a new psychological disorder for those of us who hang out on Pinterest.  This is a great app to feed your obsession!
B007XNAPNY|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this band and tend to gobble up anything Duran Duran releases, so I was very excited when the release of this concert DVD was announced.<br /><br />Technically, I was very pleased with this DVD. Picture and sound were both excellent -- at least on my home theater system.<br /><br />My issues with the DVD are as follows -- and these have less to do with the DVD than the show the DVD was based on:<br /><br />1.) Odd song to open the concert with in the song Before The Rain -- not exactly an upbeat song! Also, too many hits and not enough tracks off the new album they were alledgedly touring on.  I wish they had performed the excellent Too Bad You're So Beautiful, Leave A Light On, Being Followed, Mediterranea, or Other People's Lives. Even half of those instead of Hungry Like The Wolf, Girls On Film and Rio would have been preferred. Anyone wanting those hits I would refer to the Live In London DVD -- which had the reunited band -- complete with original guitarist Andy Taylor performing those overplayed hits. I'm a diehard fan though -- and one who has seen the band live many times. As such, I'd have loved a show filled with album tracks and B-sides but I won't hold my breath for such a show! :-)<br /><br />2.) Not enough bells and whistles (extras) on this DVD. AFTER the DVD was released, a downloadable commentary track was released but it should have been on this DVD. The interview segment was interesting, but as with most band interviews -- not very in depth or of much substance.<br /><br />Despite these minor quibbles, I really enjoyed the disc and recommend it to any DD fan but I wish the set list had been even more focused on the songs of their excellent album All You Need Is Now. If you are reading this and don't own that album, I highly recommend that as the finest DD album since the original lineup made it big in the 80's.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its fun im only doing this reveiw tho cuz the game made me. but watevs. anyways... ADD ME! its sokkerchick0126 :)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It is really fun; I'm a gamer and a history buff, so I picked up this game for free. I had (and am still, after a highly irritating reset) lots of fun playing the app. But after a month or so, it said I could only harvest my crops in a considerably... realistic time.<br /><br />I recommend it! :)
B008FOB124|5.0|I just witnessed this incredible band live for the first time this past Saturday night in Durham, NC (unbelievably part of their tour schedule this time around!!!) and I still haven't been able to feel the ground beneath my feet from being so elated and blown away by what I heard and saw!!!  I've been a longtime fan of DCD and so I halfway knew what to expect with the world music approach from Lisa and the more relaxed / folky (but still excellent!) compositions from Brendan ... but after listening to (and seeing) them performing the songs live from this new release, I had NO IDEA that they could get even better after being away for 16 years.  They simply STILL HAVE IT!!!  Plain and simple.  (Although there's definitely NOTHING \\"plain and simple\\" about DCD!)  Do yourselves a favor here, people ...... BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!  Support this incredibly talented band and show them the love and respect they so richly deserve.  God only knows, they've earned it through sheer HARD WORK.  What better way to gain long-lasting respect than that, right?  Give them their due!<br /><br />Long live the music and spirit of Dead Can Dance!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is almost as good as [[ASIN:B004ULORYU Killing Lincoln: The Shocking Assassination that Changed America Forever]].<br /><br />I spent 23 years in the military and have no problem with this guy telling his story.<br /><br />What I do have a problem with is President Obama and his administration releasing all the classified material they have and continue to do.<br /><br />They all signed the Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement (SF-312), the same as this guy and I did, so what's the difference?<br /><br />One did it for money and the other political gain?<br /><br />I think he wrote the book for the right reasons...To tell the Seals side of the story.<br /><br />Anyone can give the OK, when he has a room full of people to advise him.  Sort of like the USAF dropping bombs...They never see the victims.<br /><br />I am glad that Osama Bin Laden is dead, but Obama just took a chance and said go. If the Mission had failed, I wonder what he would have blamed or said.<br /><br />That's what he gets paid to do...Give others the praise for success and take the blame for failures.<br /><br />Buy the book, it's a good read...

B008MG1E4A|5.0|For all of you claiming this should stay classified and this guys is a sellout suck it.  I think everyone that perished on 9/11 as well as their families deserves to know the truth of how OBL died.  We have to watch and re-watch the way they died every year for the next 1000 years.  I don't care if we give out a few minor details...we deserve to know how they got him, how they found him and how they watched him die.  No different than what we all have to do every Sept 11th in watching the countless shows re-airing that painful day.  So you guys would rather have no picture of him and not know anything....suck it....OBAMA!
B0020M99LC|4.0|I watched this on Amazon Instant Video and the streaming was very clear, I enjoyed the movie. I hadn't seen the James Bonds films recently so I didnt know how great they were but once I started to see how great this downloaded version was and how fast it started, I was happy with it.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I loved this book!  I was trepidatious about the book at first, but I grew to truly love the characters.  I wish Po and Kat had a sequel!
B0055Q5F36|5.0|I bought a \\"Seidio Case and Holster Combo for AT&T and International Samsung Galaxy S II\\" because it cost few dollars less than the Otterbox case. My mistake. The Seidio case created a echo on all my calls. I bought an Otterbox and case solved. I'm never leaving Otterbox...
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|If you enjoy games like Space Invaders or Galaga you'll feel right at home with Radiant HD.  This is a very fun arcade-style space shooter.  The controls are really easy, the ship fires automatically all you have to do is move it side to side to avoid enemy fire and to collect coins and upgrades.  At the end of each wave you can spend the money you earn to buy weapon upgrades.  The are a number of different weapons ranging from lasers, missiles, to spread-shots.<br /><br />In between each wave you get a couple lines of dialog to keep the story going.  There is a lot of humor in the writing and it can be a lot of fun to see the back and forth between your ship and the aliens.  Visually the game looks pretty good.  Enemies glow with bright neon colors and so do each of your weapons.<br /><br />It would have been nice to a little more variety in the levels but other than that this is a really nice game.  If your looking for a simple, fun, relaxing game, look no farther than Radiant HD.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I tried posting a review about 45 minutes ago, but wasn't allowed the opportunity because \\"the book has not yet been released\\" (yet someone else had already posted??). This was delivered to my Kindle about three hours ago and I haven't been able to put it down, it's exciting and captivating reading. For now, though, my main intention is simply to give this book a tentative 5-star rating, subject to change as I read further into it. I'll allow the possibility that I may ultimately be disappointed, in light of other reviews.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Having read all the George RR Martin books the HBO series was a great bonus and I had enjoyed the seasons one and two so much having the DVD was fantastic.  I can now enjoy watching Game of Thrones again and again plus share it with my family and friends who have not seen the show.  Thank you Amazon for letting me know when it came out on DVD.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|this was a visual feast and a great introductioh to sushi. I really learned a great deal about this aspect of Japanese culture.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Super Stickman Golf is about as fun of a game of 2D golf you can get.  There is huge variety of courses, each with 9 unique holes to play. The controls are very easy.  All you have to do is take your time to line up the perfect angle for your shot and set the appropriate power to watch the ball goes flying.<br /><br />Its a lot of fun trying to see how few shots you can finish each hole with.  This is made a whole lot easier with the power-ups you're given at the beginning of each game.  The first power-up you unlock is the mulligan which lets you reset after a bad shot.  Before you start a course you're allowed to choose up to seven power-ups which is really nice considering you only have to play nine holes at a time.<br /><br />With all the different courses and time spent trying going back to improve scores this game has a ton of replay value!  Stickman Golf is easily one of the best games I've download on my Kindle Fire and I can't recommend it enough.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love puzzles but don't have the space. this allows me to take my puzzle with me. the only problem I have is it will tell me the app has stopped working and to force close or wait. still worth it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is the cutest game to play with your kids! Dragon Story has a varity of dragons to raise, feed, and crossbreed. Unlike most games involving dragons, this game strongly encourages teamwork in the &quot;dragon community&quot;. So come check it out!
0385341008|5.0|I read this book on recommendation from my daughter. The first thing I noticed was that it was written in \\"letter\\" format. Now, when I come across a letter in a novel my reaction is usually impatience to get through it and back to the novel; so, that was my reaction to this book at first. However,  I was won over by the charm and simplicity and wit contained in the pages. A delightful read, a worthwhile time spent, and now I want to visit Guernsey!
B0066O0MZW|4.0|\\"The Good Wife\\" is quality entertainment AND 23 episodes per season.<br />The main character roles are well developed as Alicia (the main<br />character)projects an enchanting, alluring and mysterious persona.<br />In other words, it gets better as the season progresses.<br />I like to speculate on what may happen next, and the GW offers<br />many opportunities. I urge you not to read ahead to future<br />episodes.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I couldn't put it down yet I feared getting to the end because it would be over.
0307951529|5.0|As an entrepreneur most of my life, I get my inspiration from others who have dared to do what they dreamed of doing.  Chris has assembled a lot of dreams, and a lot of advice, all in one place.  He writes simply and weaves in real-life stories to make a fun and inspiring business book.<br /><br />Everyone should achieve their dreams.  But often entrepreneurs lock the door for newbies by making entrepreneurship sounds impossible, only for MENSA members, or too expensive.  Chris breaks down those doors and creates a path for everyone to follow who wants to be their own boss.  I applaud Chris for having the guts to challenge the status quo.  It has needed to be challenged for a very long time.

The DVD that came with the product didn't work I emailed to the address on the pamphlet, they responded quickly with a link that was quick to install.  I want to THANK YOU for saving our old cassettes! We are enjoying the whole process!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app because it can play all sorts of sounds and even mp3 is included. this is so amazing. :)
0380729407|4.0|This is the story of Will and Jim, best friends for as long as they can remember. One night, a carnival comes to town. But something about this carnival is not quite right and the boys are determined to find out what.<br /><br />This is a fantastic story. It is about love and friendship, good versus evil. It is about our desires and our fears. It has wonderful descriptions, but the writing is a little difficult at times and interrupts the flow of the action. Were it not for that, this would be a five star book. Definitely a recommended read.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|People really need to know that just because something is realistic doesnt mean its good.  There is a reason for LOTR and othe FAKE fantasy books that were a lot more entertanig than this.  This easliy consumed hours of my life that i will never get back.  And dont get me started on the typos.  And the reason it took hours is because Martin added pointless detail after pointless deatail.  This book fails at being real too otherwise life would be very depressing.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is the only version of Jane Eyre where Mr. Rochester isn't always yelling and screaming at Jane.  In many of the movies I have seen I could never understand why she agreed to marry him.  However in this version, I can see that they are both cut from the same cloth and really made for each other.  I really enjoyed this version... everything Materpiece productions does it great
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was exactly as I expected and more. It was great. The ending left me wanting more and I started in the next book then! Loved it
B003K16P3M|4.0|This is actually a 4 1/2 star book.<br /><br />Graceling takes place in a land with 7 kingdoms. There are people who have special talents, which are called Graces. Those with graces are often treated with fear and mistrust. Katsa is one of those with a grace and called a Graceling. Katsa's uncle, the King, uses her and her grace to bully and intimidate his people.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters are well-developed, and you can't help but come to feel for Katsa. The story went in a direction I had not expected from the description and the beginning of the story. I believe where the story went was better than where I thought it was going. The ending was a surprise as well. Ms. Cashore wrote a deep, engrossing adventure with great relationships between the characters.<br /><br />While this book is classified as Young Adult, as with much in this genre, this is a story that I think older readers will enjoy, possibly more than younger readers.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|A friend picked this up at a garage sale and we played it for several weeks when we were together. But my kids and I were finding that we wanted to play it on our own. I didn't realize how expensive it was, however on Amazon I got a good deal and cheaper than any store I went to.<br />We look forward to hours of more fun playing this game.
B007J7LFTW|5.0|I was leery that it would be as good as the first TAAB but I saw his tour in 1972 promoting the first TAAB album so I had to have it. I was not disappointed at all great job!!

B000QZ1LXO|2.0|It worked as well as the other one I bought however the piece of foam around the part that moved (I guess to pick of sound better) fell off and was lost - very bad design.  The one I now have is about the size of a deck of cards - easier to deal with.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I wish I could rate this book 3.5 stars... I decided to bump it up to 4, since this book is well-written and intriguing, but it's just not my style.  I read it because I have read all of Blake Crouch's previous works and loved them (all 5 stars), but the genre (sub-genre?) is not quite the same.  The story flows and all of my questions were answered by the end, it even piqued my curiosity at times.  It was worth a shot and by no means a waste of time, but once was enough.  I'll still pick up Blake's next book, but I hope it's in his more traditional style.
0525953728|5.0|Some readers of this review will say \\"What, the Pentagon is threatening legal action against the Navy Seal who wrote this book to keep it off the market.\\"<br /><br /> Exactly, if the Defense Department didn't want this book read they would certainly not have publicly threatened legal action against the book's author. Since they have provided the book millions of dollars in free publicity and news coverage, it's obvious that they want people to know all about this book. They may say they don't like it, but actions speak louder than empty talk.<br /><br /> That said, this author and his co-writer have provided the public with it's first on the spot eyewitness account of what really happened on \\"Operation Neptune Spear\\" (most people have never even heard of that name).<br /><br />Unlike the many accounts of what happened that appeared in the press and in political ads, this is the story of who really built the operation that brought the mass murder Osama Bin Laden to justice. If anything, the shot-by-shot, white-knuckles account proves Bin Laden got off easy and died too quickly. Once he stuck his head out of his bedroom door to see what was happening the Navy Seal Point leading the raiders up the stairs man blew Osama's brains out all over the floor.<br /><br /> Most readers will be thrilled by the actual eyewitness reporting of that faithful raid--even people who are normally queasy about such raw descriptions of hand-to-hand<br />combat.<br /><br /> The book is about much more than that raid, it's also about what makes a person<br /> want to go through hell in order to be the best of the best. The author's personal story of following his hope of becoming a Navy Seal is compelling. The descriptions of many of the other operations he was involved in are almost as exciting.<br /><br /> The author also was careful not to give away and military secrets. \\"With the assistance of my publisher, I hired a former Special Operations attorney to review the manuscript to ensure that if was free from mention of forbidden topics and that it cannot be used by sophisticated enemies as a source of sensitive information to compromise or harm the United States...\\"<br /><br /> Since this is a story of true heroes, it's great that these experiences have finally been made available to the public. It's good to get the facts from the standpoint of people, the actual heroes who were actually there doing the dirty job.<br /><br /> The book also has many helpful photos, charts and maps to help the reader better visualize what happened in Osama secret compound deep in the heart of a Pakistan military town.hat if was free from mention of forbidden topics and that it cannot be used by sophisticated enemies as a source of sensitive information to compromise or harm the United States...\\"<br /><br /> Since this is a story of true heroes, it's great that these experiences have finally been made available to the public.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very quick transaction.  LOVED the book.  Can't wait to get the next one!  Definately recommend as a great series that you will finish in no time!
B00000J048|5.0|This is a great toy! My 2 year old and 4 year old both love it! It doesn't hold their attention as well as Tubation, but truthfully, I think they're still a bit young for this. There are four prongs on the back of each gear that are supposed to connect to the board, and it's a bit difficult for them to get them placed just right next to another gear. They still really enjoy it, they just require a good bit of help right now. I am certain it will grow to be one of their favorite toys! Keep in mind that the white clips that go on the back pf the gears DO count as pieces, as do the white \\"floor\\" pieces. There are still plenty of gears to fully enjoy this toy!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|We both read the series, we both saw it in the movie theater and we both watched it at home via amazon on our tv, GREAT MOVIE! Cant wait for the next 2 to come out!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome. I love it. I recommend it to everybody. It is like a city simulation. Best game ever

B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so excited when this app came out. I downloaded it right away and haven't looked back! I have a kindle fire so when I used pinterest in my browser, I could never pin anything where I wanted it, if it would even pin. No issues and no complaints.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. It is folky and fabulous. Just like expected. I do hate that the lyrics to the very intricate ballads seem to have no deeper meaning behind them. However, the tunes are catchy and the lyrics are fun. I can't be too critical because I have literally not stopped listening to this CD since I bought it a month ago.
0452287022|5.0|This book was very simple yet rich and vivid.  Wonderful story.  Memorable characters.  A deep protagonist.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy coming of age stories and historical fiction.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I stumbled upon Imagine Dragons back in January through sheer stupid luck. The indie rock Gods must have been smiling down on me that day. From the very first listen to \\"It's Time\\" I was hooked. I knew from that moment that this band was going to go Big. Of course I didn't picture them going Big quite so fast (although the band has been working at this for years). It has been really cool to watch the band's rise in popularity. It seems like I can't turn on a radio without hearing \\"It's Time.\\" What is cooler though is that as amazing as \\"It's Time\\" is, it's just the beginning. Night Visions is a stellar debut album. It is the product of hard work and vast musical talent. The songs hold common threads that make for a strong sense of album unity but the fact of the matter is that each one is a unique gem of enjoyment. Another review of the Continued Silence EP called Imagine Dragons a \\"radio friendly indie rock band\\" and that is a great description. There is an undeniable appeal here to the mainstream, even thought the quality is beyond the \\"mass consumption\\" label. From the well written lyrics and the percussive electronic beat to the subtle guitar work and vocals that are at once polished and natural, Night Visions is a debut album that sounds anything but \\"debut.\\"<br /><br />\\"Radioactive\\" - If the throbbing, pulsating beat of this song doesn't get you pumped there is something wrong with you. The vocals are firmly in charge of this stellar post-Apocalyptic rock song. Welcome to the New Age!<br /><br />\\"Tip Tope\\" - I wasn't impressed with this song the first time I listened to it. After a few more listens I have to say that it has grown on me. I really dig the synth. There is a definite pop draw to this song, it makes you want to dance. ***EDIT*** After several more play throughs this has become one of my favorite tracks on the album. I can't seem to get it out of my head.<br /><br />\\"It's Time\\" - The essential Imagine Dragons song, complete with rhythm clapping and a mandolin. The song is beautiful, musically and lyrically. If you have heard of Imagine Dragons it is probably because of this song. If I had to declare a Song of the Year for 2012, this would be it.<br /><br />\\"Demons\\" - We all have our inner demons and that makes this song all the more empowering. The music takes a back seat to the vocals and lyrics this time around but the trademark sound is still present. If you're in a dark place, give this song a listen.<br /><br />\\"On Top of the World\\" - It's funny how a song can grow on you. I didn't much care for this one at first but you know what? It's catchy. The music has this sort of cheery, Lion King vibe going on and it might just give you that necessary pick-up when you need it.<br /><br />\\"Amsterdam\\" - This one is a little more subdued than the previous tracks, a bit more intimate. Musically this one is strong and I really enjoy the ups and downs of Dan's vocals. It starts out low and rises as the song goes.<br /><br />\\"Hear Me\\" - This is one of my favorite older tracks. Like \\"Amsterdam\\" the highs and lows of Dan's vocals are great and match the flow of the lyrics perfectly. I love the percussion near the end of the song and the electronic beat.<br /><br />\\"Every Night\\" - Time to slow things up a bit. The quality of the lyrics isn't quite up to par with the rest of the Imagine Dragons songs here. There are some strong lines but overall this track reminds me of \\"My Fault\\" from the Continued Silence EP.<br /><br />\\"Bleeding Out\\" - I was so freaking excited for this track, ever since I heard the album preview. Oh man, this song gets me pumped! As tame as the last track is, this one makes up for it in spades. Dan's vocals soar, the lyrics are premium and the music rises energetically. There is a raw edge that boosts this track and makes you want to scream it from the top of the tallest mountain.<br /><br />\\"Underdog\\" - This is another strong new track, trending more towards the pop side of Imagine Dragons than rock. Idon't even like pop but this song is fun and enthusiastic. Who doesn't love to be the underdog?<br /><br />\\"Nothing Left to Say\\" - It is impossible NOT to have an emotional connection to these songs. This one is a bit darker compared to the more inspirational songs like \\"Demons\\" but that's its strength. There is something haunting about this song I can't yet put my finger on but it is there.<br /><br />\\"Rocks\\" - And alas, a great ending to a great debut album. This and \\"Bleeding Out\\" are my favorite new tracks. It's fast paced and the vocals have a whimsical sort of characteristic. It's folky and fun.<br /><br />So there it is. Night Visions, the debut album of the rising alternative rock stars Imagine Dragons. You will find new things to love with every listen, I sure know that I have. Even tracks you aren't keen on at first could very well nestle themselves in the folds of your brain and take root. This band is destined for great things and I will be following along in eager anticipation. If you enjoy the album I highly suggest seeing them live if you get the opportunity. I saw them perform at Firefly Festival in Dover, Delaware and it was a vigorous show. The affection and determination the band pours into its music is heart warming in this day and age.<br /><br />***EDIT***<br />The iTunes version of Night Visions comes with two additional songs, \\"Working Man\\" and \\"Fallen.\\" If you bought the album elsewhere I suggest you purchase these two tracks individually from iTunes. You gotta have the complete collection. The track \\"Fallen\\" is especially good, it's a shame that it wasn't included on the album.don't even like pop but this song is fun and enthusiastic.

1416914285|5.0|I seen book 3?... I think at my local book store and on a whim purchased it not knowing anything about this series. The graphics on the cover is what had me. They are totally cool like foil type but not, its really hard to explain but they are pretty. Under neath the covers is just plain black and the title of the book on the spine. Not much to see.<br /><br />Anyways back to the book. So I had to go in search of the rest of the series since they only had the other parts in paperback (the one I had purchased was in hardback form) so naturally I went online to check for deals and found it cheap on here.<br /><br />I love the characters- Clary, Simon, Jace, Alec and Izzy to name a few. They rock! Cassandra totally nailed it with them. Right from the beginning they pull you in and before you know like any other good book its all over way to soon. Love this series.
B00170DEM8|5.0|I am a fan of classic movies anyway - I appreciate the artistic creation in films before computers - this has beautiful backdrops.  This movie is delightful - the musical numbers are fantastic and the story line grabs you from the start!  Great family movie!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does exactly what the description says.  Its working great on my Fire.  I'm going to get the paid version just to support the developer.
B003ZMF26W|1.0|They make it look like it is a wireless gaming mouse but it isn't, it is just a regular gaming mouse.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|WOrds cannot describe how amazing this cd is. And shipped quick too. Great poster inside. Great songs. Highly recommended. Great price. You will love it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are a little too easy but they're fun. It can be a time suck though. I usually play for way longer than I originally intended.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is definitely better written than the 50 shades book although you can't discount the similarities . I enjoyed it better the second time I read it. The love scenes are intense and well done.
0525953728|4.0|This book provides a good look into a different culture.  For example, I'm an asian man (chinese) and my wife is tall, beautiful and blonde.  We go with a grander, big-picture look when we analyze politics and military events.  This is a must-read for anyone who wants a first-person account of an important event.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I kept hearing about this book and I usually read Historical romance books not 21st century books.  I thought I would give it a try.  I couldn't put it down.  The author is wonderful with his words and keeps you turning the page.  I am reading book 2 right now and will read book 3.  Awesome reading!
B007NCSQFO|1.0|Nicki Minaj has no talent and should be chased out of America with pitchforks because she is a talentless, tone deaf, disgrace to the music industry bimbo. Anyone who enjoyed this album might as well drill their ears in and pick up a Nickelback album.
B0060D15AK|5.0|This movie is very funny and entertaining. At some parts it is kinda boring but it gets better and better by the minute.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is really great because if you get tired of one game you can always play another game. some games are easier than others so you if one game is too hard than you have easier options to choose from.
B005LLT0DQ|5.0|I started to watch SOA on Amazon Prime about 3 months ago on a recommendation.  I did not have my hopes up as tv has gotten so boring to watch as of late except for a few shows.  I must admit that I have now watched all 4 seasons of SOA and it is one of the best and most addicting shows in a long while.  The acting is great, good mix of violence and quick witted comedy.  My only gripe is that the show has become a bit predictable as the seasons go on, only because there is only so much trouble that a MC club can get into and still remain mostly free.  I am now patiently waiting for Sept 11, 2012 for SOA Season 5.  SAMCRO!

B0092SQBJA|5.0|A few songs stuck to me instantly a few did not. but after listening to all of it twice I LOVE IT ALL has the same tdcc dance indie feel cant wait to learn the songs on guitar.
034580404X|3.0|Books were not what expected. I think there was so much hype about these books that I was disappointed when I read them. After the first book it was just the same thing over and over and over.
B001NHN7TU|4.0|Terrific upgrade from the DVD release.  PQ better than average, sound is very good.  Fun movie to watch more than once.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|To be honest, I only read this book because so many people had been going on about it for so long, I just had to see what all the fuss was about. I was surprised how much I liked it, because I'm not normally much of a fantasy fan, but this was a very intriguing story told with real style. I might even read the next in the series, who knows?
B005ELZNH0|5.0|This collections contains twenty two  excellent cd's from Miles Davis .The sound is great and the price extremely cheap for such a big amount of Mr Davis work .All the cd's included are superb.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|I read a lot of books and generally dislike the movies that are made from them. In this case I was caught up in the hype of the movie, not sure why as I never finished reading the first book as I was not interested in it at all.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Very addicting game with enjoyable missions.  Needs more distinct missions, keeps repeating losing replay value. Fun and enjoyable for young and old.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is another of those books I only picked up because of all the hype and the discussion. Unlike some big hits, this really doesn't deserve its reputation. I enjoy erotica, but this was seedy, sleazy and so badly written I thought I got the wrong book and was reading a parody. Avoid.
B00122BEPA|5.0|This is an excellent album that contains a lot of great music. The price was outstanding and a great addition to my library.

B008RTE066|5.0|History has confirmed and it is there for everyone to see. The Magical Mystery Tour is best in between the lines. What was in the mind of a genius who was just willing to go off the beaten track(s) with something to roll up for? This is only one of the questions worth discussing... And not only at a bar table. The real magic is conveyed by the tunes alone. But such music wrapped up in material of this sort is beyond a real fan's dream. It does not matter that it was then considered a poor quality movie. The movie is only a memorable detail. The Beatles were having a ball and the fun of it all has lasted much longer than was expected at the time. Why not!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|On hearing all the reviews I just had to download this trilogy, and God how happy I am now!! It took until perhaps chapter 7 or 8 to get into the book and its story line but I think thats normall with all books, its just that Id heard so much about this book I was expecting all the action on the first page!! lol.. however once I got into this book I found it so hard to put down and only did so when I went to work, sleep and do some housework!! Once I finished the first book, I moved swiftly on to the second and third. The only regret I have is that I read it too quick and that there isnt a fourth and fifth book!!!! I cant wait for the film, just hope it does the book justice!!!
B005LAIHPY|4.0|It's the hackneyed formula plot of humankind being knocked on our butts by aliens or monsters, picking ourselves up off the mat and whipping butt. See \\"Independence Day\\" et al. This plot goes back far enough and has been employed frequently enough that it earned a brilliant parody in \\"Mars Attacks.\\"<br /><br />But forget that (except for the reprise of the Jim Brown fight scene - parodying the parody!). Overlook that the acting makes Keanu Reeves seem like Sir Laurence Olivier. This works, if only as a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />It's got more plot clichés than Jennifer Aniston has had heartbreaks, but it still gets your adrenaline going, partly due to a decent soundtrack. If you're down from watching one government screw-up after another, strap it on and watch your navy kick some serious alien tail.
B0013081IO|2.0|While everything else was fine, the album did not come in the yellow vinyl as the description said. I paid a few extra bucks for it that I could have saved if I bought just the regular vinyl, which is what I received.
0446572993|4.0|The Innocent was a very good book by my standards. It kept me reading the whole time and it didnt have any of those slow, boring parts.
B007AL48UK|2.0|Please fix this new upgrade. I have loved playing most of your mahjong games. But after this last upgrade it is very hard to play. For some reason When I push a tile and then match it. It won't clear like it did.  please fix this.  thank you.

B008O69SZ0|5.0|The thing is, Ian Hunter simply writes great songs. This was obvious to those of us who loved all the Mott stuff. More importantly, he wrote the songs nobody else could write. They are intensely personal songs that somehow touched the universal. That's was a true artist is able to do. I'm thinking about \\"Waterlow,\\" \\"When My Mind's Gone,\\" \\"The Moon Upstairs\\"(thanks Mick Ralphs),\\"Boy,\\" and too many others to mention.<br /><br />His last four albums find Ian in true form. Trust me, they take a bit of time. Both Shrunken Heads and Man Overboard took several listens. But then they revealed the charms. \\"Girl from the Office\\" is as profoundly beautiful as his \\"Angel from Eighth Avenue.\\" The guy bleeds humanity's tunes.<br /><br />So there is only so much to do with a rock song? Not on the new Hunter album. Listen to this over and over. The nuances will present their melodies and insights. \\"When I'm President,\\" \\"Black Tears,\\" \\"Saint,\\" are personal favorites. And then there is \\"I Don't Know What You Want.\\" Jesse has a pretty good voice. The entire album simply rocks with the authority of someone who knows more about life than most of us. And, yes, the CD ends with \\"Life.\\" What a wonderful song.<br /><br />I love this record.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Ads weren't as annoying as reviews advise and the games play smooth as silk.  I would recommend. this game to anyone and have several friends that have started playing as well.
144235948X|5.0|I received this audiobook from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. I did not receive any compensation for my review, and the views expressed herein are my own.<br /><br />This book will rank among my favourites of 2012!<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is a dysfunctional love story about a couple who meet in college: Travis Maddox and Abby Abernathy. Travis is your typical bad-boy with a heart of gold. He's a good-looking guy covered in tattoos and has the reputation of being the college playboy. All the girls know that he is a one-night stand kind of guy, yet women still flock to him wherever he goes. Maybe it's the lure of the bad boy, or maybe it is the challenge of wanting to be the woman who tames this Lothario.<br /><br />When Travis sets his eyes on Abby Abernathy, his world is turned upside-down. Abby tries to down-play her attraction to Travis, and her hard-to-get attitude pays off. Travis is so used to women shamelessly throwing themselves at him that Abby's unexpected ambivalence towards him is a bit of a turn on! The two wind up making a bet: If Travis wins, Abby has to stay at his apartment for a month; if Abby wins, Travis has to become celibate for a month. Travis ends up winning the bet, and Abby keeps her promise to move in. Her best friend, America, is dating Travis' cousin and roommate, Shep, so America can't be any more tickled pink with the arrangement! Shep, on the other hand, is worried that if Travis breaks Abby's heart that it will be the end of his relationship with America.<br /><br />Travis and Abby grow closer and closer, but still fail to cross that line from platonic to romantic. No one in school can figure out their relationship. They spend all their time together, yet they are not dating. When the end of the month comes and it is time for Abby to move out, she picks that moment to give in to her desires. She gives up her virginity to Travis, and then she sneaks out in the morning because she is unable to face him and say good-bye. For her, it was closure on their odd relationship. For Travis, he gets a piece of what he has been dishing out for years.<br /><br />I love books that feature flawed characters, and Travis and Abby are both just about as flawed as you can get! Travis thinks that he doesn't deserve Abby, and he tries to change for her. Meanwhile, Abby feels that she can't get involved with Travis because he reminds her of her past...one from which she is trying to escape. Abby has some secrets of her own, and she thought that sleeping with Travis was the best way to get him to move on and forget about her. She figured that once the thrill of the chase was gone for him that he would proceed to his next target. She couldn't have been more wrong. Instead, Travis becomes obsessed with Abby and is a wreck without her. She won't admit it, but she is also miserable without Travis.<br /><br />I think that I probably fall into the minority on this one, but I think that Abby is more messed up than Travis! What kind of girl loses her virginity to a guy that she wants to get rid of? Abby is the one who is constantly pulling away and giving mixed signals. After they break up and she moves on, she gets mad when he tries to do the same. I kind of felt sorry for the guy, who couldn't do anything right where Abby was concerned.<br /><br />Memorable quote:<br /><br />Travis to Abby: \\"You know why I want you? I didn't know I was lost until you found me. I didn't know what alone was until the first night I spent without you in my bed. You're the one thing I've got right. You're what I've been waiting for, Pigeon.\\"<br /><br />I was initially shocked going into the book due to the mature content because I was under the wrong impression that this was a Young Adult title. It has been incorrectly labelled that way on many sites. I went to McGuire's website, where she advises that she has classified this book as a Contemporary Romance and not as Young Adult.<br /><br />I do not like stories with unrealistic couples whose relationships are perfect. McGuire's characters feel so real to me, and her story had me absolutely riveted! I could not stop listening to this audiobook! This is my second time listening to Emma Galvin, and I much preferred her narration this time around to the last one I heard (The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner by Stephenie Meyer). Her voice conveyed the appropriate emotions in the story, and I was really caught up in this tortured romance.<br /><br />It will be pure agony to wait until April 2013 to read Walking Disaster, which is told from Travis's point of view. How will I ever make it until then?!?<br /><br />MY RATING: 5 stars!! It was superb! I loved it, and I will likely re-read it again in the future! You should definitely read it! Thanks to Simon & Schuster Audio for the review copy!istic couples whose relationships are perfect. McGuire's characters feel so real to me, and her story had me absolutely riveted!

B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This is an amazing movie and a must in every musical family's collection.  The initial scenes (including a one night stand) may cause younger children to ask awkward questions, but if you can get through that the rest of the movie is fabulous!!!  Love wins out!
B00338QENI|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. Although it was assigned reading for a college class I am taking, I would've read this book on my own. It is a must read for people wanting to go into Biology or research. Not only does the book offer a great history of the road to modern research, but it allows a great glimpse into the life of Henrietta Lacks and her truly interesting family.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Very smooth graphcis as you fly through the air - just don;t ask how the squirrel is gliding with no loss of altitide! WHile it might look very expansive, the 'track' that you can fly through is actually quite narrow, so try to stay in the middle of the invisible road and not be squished into a tree because you are trapped at the side of this road.<br /><br />What I love is that very basic 'endless obstacle' game is that each time you play you have three 'goals' to acheive, and that means you can play each time with a slightly different aim. This keeps the title fresh for around a week, and frankly it's a week of value for money gaming.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game, it's pretty good for free. I would refer it to a lot of people. go ahead and get it
B0040QYROK|5.0|It's a common complaint with big-budget sci-fi films that they're all special effects and no story, and the same criticism was just as common when Fritz Lang made Metropolis, the first sci-fi epic, as it is today. That it is a triumph of design over content with some justly celebrated setpieces is a charge that has long dogged it and one which, even in the restored near-complete 150-minute version, is hard to entirely disagree with. But like Blade Runner, which borrowed some of its designs six decades later, there's also a fatalistic mood underpinning its visual spectacle that gives it more substance than the basic plot merits - here humanity and morality have been reduced to their most basic forms, so complexity or imagination isn't high on this world's agenda. And there's really not that much in the way of plot or characterisation, though what there is fits in more with the socialist tradition of early 20th century science fiction than later sci-fi films. Its tale of a spoiled member of the ruling classes of a futuristic city (Gustav Frohlich, who bears an unfortunate resemblance to a young Herman Goering before the overeating took its toll) falling for an idealised working girl (Brigitte Helm), questioning the status quo and his role as the heir to the city and in the process setting in motion a chain of events that leads to the downtrodden subterranean workers' revolution isn't a million miles from H.G. Wells' socialist parables.<br /><br />It still ends up with a punchup with a mad scientist on a cathedral roof en route to a happy ending that seems at odds with its dystopian pessimism, but it is still somewhat more politically sophisticated than many silents. Here the misconceived revolution is incited by an agent provocateur (albeit a robot one) sent by the `father' of the city who wants to increase his political power and control of the surviving workforce in the wake of their inevitable defeat. But for the most part the film espouses a kind of `the meek should at least inherit better working conditions' Biblical socialism, even offering a flashback sermon that puts forward the argument that the only reason the Tower of Babel didn't work out as planned was because the dreamers and the workers couldn't understand each other despite speaking the same language and just needed a mediator. No prizes for guessing who that Messianic mediator between hands and head will turn out to be...<br /><br />The city itself is very much the kind of thing you imagine Hitler and Albert Speer had in mind: a grandiose playground for the healthy of mind and body elite who live in palatial penthouses with their every whim catered for while the workers are automaton-like slaves kept out of sight and out of mind in the bowels of the earth where they're no more than cogs in the giant machines, doomed to dangerous backbreaking labour until they're broken and replaced by new human parts. Just in case we don't get the point, Lang even turns the mightiest of the machines into a pagan altar to Moloch, the foremen becoming priests herding the workers into its fiery jaws as human sacrifices in the wake of an industrial accident. Even Rotwang, who creates the robot Maria to lead the workers and the upper class alike to their doom, is as much an evil sorcerer conjuring up a golem as he is a mad scientist. Subtle it's not, but it is effective.<br /><br />It's still the big epic set pieces that play the best, with Lang showing his eye for a spectacular image and skilful marshalling of thousands of extras, whether they are marching in dreary uniformity or running riot in a frenzy of movement and energy and chaos. And it's still some of the idealised sentimentality and the almost comical scenes of hedonism along with the broader performances that have dated the worst (though some contemporary reviewers had their problems taking both seriously as well). But in other ways it does seem remarkably prescient, and its influence on everything from Dr Strangelove toStar Wars is undeniable.<br /><br />It's not hard to tell where the restored footage has been inserted - not only does the aspect ratio change but, even post-restoration, very visible tramlines appear throughout the image. It's possible that in a decade or so the technology will have improved enough to restore these scenes to something approaching the pristine look of the rest of the film, but in the meantime it's enough that after more than 70 years we're finally getting to see them. Although listed as running 150 minutes, six of those minutes are taken up with restoration credits and it's still missing one key scene - Fredersen and Rotwang's fight, which allows the real Maria to escape - but the additions are still substantial even if for the most part they expand scenes rather than add new ones or additional subplots. We do get to see more of Erwin Biswanger's 11811, the worker Feder changes places with, as he discovers the new world of his betters, and Fritz Rasp's `Thin Man' who spies on foes and family alike gets a much more substantial part than his few judgmental lines in the shorter version, here going about his duplicitous business like a desiccated pastor. There's also more back story of the romantic rivalry between Rotwang and Fredersen, the scientist keeping a giant idol of the woman who left him for the billionaire behind a huge curtain, while the rescue of the children from the flooding of the subterranean city is now much longer and more dramatic, as is the attack on the Heart Machine, the finale extensively crosscutting the real Maria's attempts to flee from Rotwang with the mob's capture of the robot Maria.<br /><br />Overall it's a more satisfying film than the shorter versions, the pacing actually seeming improved by the additional footage, the scale a little larger by the expansion of some of the supporting characters who were left with little to do after the cuts. And it's still one of the most visually striking films of the Twenties.<br /><br/>The BluRay of the restored version offers an impressive transfer - there's only so much that can be done with the newly discovered footage, but the rest of the film looks stunning. Extras are thin on the ground, though: an audio commentary by David Kalat and Jonathan Rosenbaum, a 55-minute German documentary about the film focussing on its restoration, and a trailer for the restored version (Eureka's UK edition includes a very impressive booklets featuring a variety of interesting pieces on the film, including Luis Bunuel's decidedly mixed review of the film and a few words from Lang himself back in 1927).

B00681QFM2|4.0|NB - As is Amazon's wont, they have bundled together the reviews for various editions of this film (the Criterion and Masters of Cinema DVD and Blu-ray releases all have different extras). This review refers to the UK Masters of Cinema Blu-ray from Eureka.<br /><br />Surprisingly rarely revived on television or event cinematheques these days, making it the kind of film you have to seek out and buy if you want to see these days, M comes with such a legendary reputation that it just seems to invite disappointment. Yet more than eight decades since it revived Fritz Lang's failing career after the twin failures of Metropolis and Woman in the Moon and making Peter Lorre's name as the pathetic child murderer hunted by an entire city, it's still both a remarkably gripping and powerful movie that leaves a lasting impression and a surprisingly exhilarating and at times breathless thriller that never lets its dark subject matter batter the film down or turn it into a sermon.<br /><br />With the remarkable visual sense that Lang's American films were never really able to duplicate as his work became gradually smoothed away into polished studio system product, it's a surprisingly energetic film as it crams a whole city into its 110-minute running time (it was originally 117 minutes, but seven - dealing with attention-seekers confessing to the murder - are still missing). There's a fascinating use of both sound and sequences of uncomfortable and prolonged total silence that's even uncannily devoid of the usual `room noise,' creating a unique atmosphere that's surprisingly disorientating (the music and effects that were added for these mute scenes for later reissues have been removed for the Blu-ray). The contrast between the panic of searching the office building for the hiding murderer and the stillness of the silent shots of the chaos they leave in their wake is particularly striking. But it's not just a case of Lang demonstrating his mastery of technique - you can believe these people are flesh and blood even though most of them have little screen time. Despite the heavy subject matter it's not without a sense of humor either, be it a crook ringing up the speaking clock to set the time on his stolen watches or a detective's bluff about a `dead' watchmen cutting away to the hale and hearty victim swigging a pitcher of beer and tucking into a sausage<br /><br />Structurally it's surprisingly ambitious: for much of the running time there is no main character - even Lorre is only briefly glimpsed in the first hour. Instead it paints a vivid picture of a city in fear, its camera veering from precise control to lengthy prowling as the film moves through all stratas of a society turning on itself as friends accuse each other, anonymous letters point the police in the wrong direction, tireless forensic work yields no viable clues and the underworld is put under such intolerable pressure by constant raids and identity checks that they resolve to catch the murderer themselves so they can get back to business as usual.<br /><br />Crosscutting between the organized crime leaders and the police as they debate what measures to take to restore normality, the ebb and flow and tempo of both meetings almost identical, Lang spends much of the second half of the film showing the two as mirror images with similar methods, sentiments and morality. While the police raid dives and red light districts, the criminals raid an office block where the murderer is hiding - their leader even donning police uniform to do so - and hold their own trial. Meanwhile the police resort to deception to crack the case as the dividing line between them all but disappears.<br /><br />It's not a flattering picture of either group - but then this is a picture that doesn't flatter any of its characters in what can be seen as a state of the nation piece in a nation on the brink of losing its sense of morality. Indeed, that split can be seen in the very cast and crew: Lang and Lorre would go into voluntary exile when Hitler came to power. Lang's wife supported the Party while one of the film's prominent co-stars, Gustaf Grundgens, would become the darling of the regime and the inspiration for Mephisto (which he didn't take kindly to, getting the book banned as libellous even though it was written by his own brother-in-law). His leather-jacketed criminal certainly displays the kind of ruthless pitiless efficiency the Gestapo would have admired. The Nazis themselves had more mixed feelings towards the film. He may have had the film banned in 1934 but Goebbels certainly admired the film's lack of human sentiment, implying that much of its box-office success in Germany may well have been from people reading the wrong things into it<br /><br />Eureka's Blu-ray also includes a 20-minute German TV interview with Lang where he talks about his German films and recounts, at length, his debunked claims that Joseph Goebbels asked him to head the German National Socialist film industry and become propagandist in chief for the regime. But then Lang always was an unreliable source: he just as frequently claimed the film was not inspired by infamous child murderer Peter Kuerten, yet there's plenty of documentary evidence that he researched the case in detail and even consulted the detectives who tracked him down. Yet perhaps it's that determination to find a better story than the ones real life provides are part of why he was such a great filmmaker.<br /><br />Aside from two scholarly audio commentaries and an impressive booklet featuring articles and old interviews with Lang and a script extract for the deleted scene, the only other extra is the English version of M (Eureka's previous two-disc DVD and Criterion's DVD and Region A-locked Blu-ray releases are much better endowed with supplements, though only Criterion's Blu-ray also includes the English version).<br /><br />The English adaptation is cut by 25 minutes from the original German version and makes afew changes in the script, most notably stressing that Lorre's character is a foreigner (\\"probably a Russian\\"). Most of the cuts seeming to be to up the pace in the first half of the picture, although some of the underbelly of the city hits the cutting room floor, narrowing the scope of the film, and the `rules of engagement' between criminals and cops - the idea that getting killed in the act of committing or preventing a crime is an acceptable professional risk - is changed to a bit of spiel about criminals living `like gentlemen' on their ill-gotten gains. Most significant is a striking bit of visual shorthand where the letters on the `Murder Bureau' board become a succession of huge close-ups until the letter M fills the screen and an the alternate ending, replacing the final shot of the mothers of the dead children with one of children at play that was presumably part of the British reshoots.<br /><br />These reshoots are surprisingly brief. Although a couple of roles are clumsily recast with English speaking actors in the phone call montage, for the most part the English version is dubbed, which is technically well done but suffers from disastrous miscasting of very posh actors attempting to speak slang in received English pronunciation accents that is unintentionally comic: when awfully, awfully well spoken gels who've been to finishing school deliver lines like \\"Tayke your hand orf me, yew dirty rotten copper!\\" or frightfully decent-sounding beggars say things like \\"Aye should say so!\\" it sounds like one of Harry Enfield's Chalmondley-Warner sketches (at least Friedrich Gnab's unlucky burglar gets a more appropriate Scottish accent). Even Lorre is dubbed in his first appearance as a shadow but thankfully when he finally gets to speak at length, he genuinely gives his performance in English, albeit with different and slightly shorter dialogue. Lorre also shot these scenes again for a French version where he was dubbed, but Eureka's disc doesn't include any extracts from this.<br /><br />Unfortunately Eureka's UK Blu-ray lets itself with that all-too-common problem with Blu-rays - ridiculously small subtitles that are rendered all the more difficult to read by not having enough of a drop shadow and often placed against a white background. They're not a problem on a 40inch screen, but anything less and you'll probably be leaning forward and squinting.

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|\\"The city's ours. We made it. We fashioned this city on stolen memories. Different eras, different parts, all rolled into one. Each night we revise it, refine it, in order to learn. About you. You and your fellow inhabitants. What makes you human.\\"<br /><br />Dark City kicks off with a classic film noir premise - a man wakes up in a hotel room with no memory, a dead woman's body in the corner and the police on the way - but quickly goes off in unexpected directions. Or rather, very expected directions if you've seen the original theatrical version, which began with a lengthy voice over explaining the film's major plot twist to avoid the audience sharing the main character's confusion. It's a surprise to discover it was co-writer/director Alex Proyas, not the studio, who added it, but thankfully its deletion is perhaps the most significant change in his director's cut that runs some ten minutes longer. Mostly the additional footage is more dialogue, more spirals (a recurrent visual motif in the film) and the occasional clarification of character points, giving the film a bit more room to breathe without feeling quite as rushed as the theatrical version. Surprisingly, that wrongheaded narration aside, both work well on their own terms without either feeling a copout or an overindulgence.<br /><br />The film itself is a remarkable mixture of German expressionism (Keifer Sutherland even models his performance on Peter Lorre, overdoing it a bit too much), film noir and future shock set in a city filled where it is always night and which no-one ever leaves. Filled with people with gaps in their memories, it is physically and socially reinvented every night by mysterious `strangers' looking for the essence of the human soul. With no memories of their own, they rearrange those of their human lab rats, turning blue collar workers into millionaires and innocent men into serial killers from one night to the next to study the results of their handiwork under the microscope. Andmemories are ultimately the key to the film - it's not simply a matter of deciphering the hidden messages in his artificial memories that hold the key to Rufus Sewell's amnesiac surviving the experiment but the very nature of memory that drives the film itself. Are memories a comfort or a torment? Are our emotions dictated as much by memory as the present moment? Are we defined by what we remember? And just how much of what we choose to remember do we really remember and how much do we simply reduce to précis and ignore?<br /><br />While they have no empathy, one of the `strangers' (Richard O'Brien) is even willing to die for the answers, becoming the person Sewell was meant to be, remembering what he cannot, giving in to the homicidal urges he rejects, ultimately becoming a tragic figure trying to find individuality in the worst of humanity at the cost of his own life while Sewell tries to recapture the best of his stolen humanity to save his life. Yet despite the heavy ideas, Proyas makes it an impressively visual experience, the constant `tuning' of the city proving surprisingly spectacular despite the comparatively modest budget. He also shows a truly inspired use of the widescreen space, for once using it not to emphasise width but for depth, emphasising the claustrophobia with interior sets that are narrow and deep, more like corridors or alleys than bedrooms or diners. The colour scheme is also surprisingly successful, using a potentially disastrously limited palette of blacks and greys that doesn't fall into the kind of visual clichés of so many derivative orange-and-teal photographed dystopias but manages to sap the life from the city without losing its credibility or detail. But more than the technical achievements, he manages to make it an involving and enthralling experience that carries you along even on subsequent viewings when you know the answers. The Matrix and Inception would later use similar ideas and imagery to more box-office success and with bigger action set pieces, but while this never managed to break out to a mainstream audience it's still an exhilarating experience.<br /><br />The Region A-locked Director's Cut Bluray offers a decent package that improves on previous DVD releases, with both the 111-minute director's cut and the 100-minute original theatrical version, two audio commentaries, stills galleries, trailer and two documentaries, both of which are very much taking heads affairs but are a definite cut above the norm because he heads doing the talking (Proyas and writers Lem Dobbs and David Goyer in particular) are being frank about the film's development and discussing the ideas behind the film in surprising depth for once instead of just reciting anecdotes or saying how great everyone was. A few minor extras from the French special edition DVD of the theatrical cut like the original brief making of featurette and b-roll footage haven't been included, but they're no great loss in light of the quality rather than quantity of the new extras (Entertainment's original UK DVD of the theatrical version only contained the brief promo and trailer). The picture quality is excellent too, more than coping with the darkness without sacrificing detail.
B005GQ5HB0|4.0|This is a book where you are compelled to read on to the end.  It is an intriguing account of historical events from a new perspective.  The narrator, who is both narrator and protagonist within the novel, is authentic.  We follow him from his teenage years to adulthood and become involved in his obsession of an enigma.  The enigma is his first love who we learn leads a deep and troubled double life.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold lives with his wife Maureen and since his retirement he spends most of his time indoors until the day he receives a letter from an old acquaintance telling him she is dying and is writing to say goodbye.  Harold writes a response and goes out to post the letter.  However, once he gets to his mailbox he decides to go to the next post box and on and on until he finally decides he's going to walk to visit his friend even though it's five hundred miles away.<br /><br />Harold's walk is a time of self-discovery not only for himself but for Maureen as well as they come to terms with the wasted years of blame and regret.  Ultimately they discover that,  `people would make the decisions they wished to make, and some of them would hurt both themselves and those who loved them, and some would pass unnoticed, while others would bring joy.'<br /><br />I loved this book!  It is very well written, thoughtful and touching.

B006U1KUR6|4.0|Reading a Neil Gaiman novel is always a pleasure for me. Just when I think I know where the plot is going, or even a single scene, he surprises me with some clever twist or imaginative phrasing. Stardust is a quick read, but that in no way diminishes the details Gaiman gives his well-crafted world.<br /><br />The otherwise ordinary village of Wall contains a pathway, a literal breach in a wall, to a magical faerie realm. It is through this realm that Tristan Thorne must travel to capture a fallen star. And he will do this for love.

0345803485|5.0|Wow! I loved it. And I doubt yall need me writing a review with all the controversy going on about 50 Shades of Grey but I will put my two cents in.<br />I've heard this book being called 'mommy porn' when yes, it could be called that but there are alot of books out there that can be described as that. I think what the big deal about this book is the BDSM and the strong, vivid detail. For women who are what are described as 'cookie-cutter housewifes' or 'who live the vanilla lifestyle,' then yes this could be very crude for them but it's not like the back of the book doesn't tell you this. The sex in the story isn't really that bad, it's when he's talking about the BDSM lifestyle that it gets rough around the edges (if your not use to this kinda thing).<br />I found the book to be exhilerating and intense but also soooo romantic. Christian Grey reminded me alot of Edward Cullen (the book, NOT the movie). Christian is intense and brooding. He has a past and secrets and a forbidden life but he likes this girl but knows it's wrong to bring her into his life.<br />The ending is sad and intense and if I hadn't know that the story continues, I would still be gripping the book and crying 'noooooooooooo,' lol. So yes, I will be running out and getting the next two books ASAP.

B007PF7MGS|1.0|Yes, this diet will make people lose weight. It is essentially a macrobiotic style vegan diet. Of course you will lose weight eating like that. However, one size fits all diets do not work for everyone. And not everybody does well on a pure vegan diet long term.<br /><br />He lists some fabulous success stories, but we have no idea but many people did NOT do so well on his 100 percent vegan diet. Some people do fine eating vegan, but some may need a little bit of meat here and there.<br /><br />He is rather against people taking vitamin supplements. Sure, he cites studies. But those studies were done using synthetic forms of vitamins and in the wrong proportions. Of course the alpha form of Vitamin E taken alone is bad. This is why one supplements with MIXED tocopherols. There is a right way and a wrong way to approach supplementation. But he almost makes it look as if all supplementation was bad, and research simply does not support this view. Anyone taking supplements should periodically get blood work done to check relavent nutrient levels so you know if you are taking the correct amount.<br /><br />Vegans can run into much more micronutrient deficiencies than B12, and he fails to adequately address that issue. Some other nutrients vegans may be at risk for being deficient in include: zinc, taurine, methionine, iodine, D3, and  healthy fats.<br /><br />Sure, you can try to get iodine from seaweed, but just how clean is the ocean these days? Between heavy metals, oil spills and radioactivity, I am not sure I dare eat enough seaweed to give me enough iodine. I would rather take a quality supplement.<br /><br />He states that starch is a \\"clean\\" food. Perhaps it may pick up fewer environmental toxins than butter and meat, but he does not adequately stress the importance of buying organic. All the green leafy vegetables are heavily sprayed, and buying organic is important. Potatoes should be organic. Strawberries MUST be organic. He does not adequately stress that organic starches and vegetables tend to have a higher nutrient content than the same non-organic counterparts. He does not mention that non-orgnanic wheat can contain Round-up, as Monsanto has been urging farmers to use Round-up to kill the wheat at harvest time for a faster harvest; and Round-up contains proprietary 'inert' ingredients that can be just as toxic to humans. Anyone eating non-organic wheat does so at their peril. Non-organic rice can have arsenic in it.<br /><br />He fails to adequately explain why he thinks methionine is so bad. Certainly too much methionine is bad, but so is too little methionine. And vegans can be at risk for not getting enough. Methionine is an essential amino acid, and it has many benefits: helping prevent fatty liver, lowering acetaldehyde levels after alcohol ingestion; and because acetaldehyde is toxic, methionine may reduce the damaging effects of alcohol.<br /><br />His main statement on methionine is that it turns into homocysteine, but this is entirely a too simplistic and limited view. The methylation cycle is more than just methionine turning into homocysteine. Other things such as folate, B6, and B12 are involved, as well as COMT and MTHFR genetic polymorphisms.ganic starches and vegetables tend to have a higher nutrient content than the same non-organic counterparts.

Previous watches, if I left them sit more than 24 hours, the watch would be stopped and I'd have to reset it.  This one sat over the weekend and when I picked it up, it was still going and I didn't have to reset it.  It also hasn't seemed to lose or gained anytime in the week I've had it.  The luminescence lasted well into the night.  My only complaint, if I have one is the band isn't the best but it will do for now.  It is rather light and unobtrusive.  The crown at the 4 o'clock position is out of the way and doesn't get caught at all.  I'm really impressed and like this watch a lot.

Yes, I cried at the end of the first book.  I couldn't wait for her to finish her copy of the second book, so I bought the e-books from Amazon!  The second book didn't disappoint, and I actually felt a bit sad when I realized there were only three books in the series.
0316023744|1.0|Antony Beevor has won an undeserved reputation as a historian. His book on Stalingrad plagiarised John Erickson's far better books on the war on the Eastern Front, and his book on the war in Spain plagiarised Hugh Thomas' book.<br /><br />On the big questions of the Second World War, Beevor reveals his out-dated prejudices. He has never a good word to say about our allies, the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party. He relies on Jon Halliday and Jung Chang for `correcting' his account of Japan's war on China.<br /><br />Early in his book he writes, \\"The Japanese had recently been taken aback by Communist forces in northern China launching a series of attacks.\\" And, \\"The Communists managed to push back the Japanese in many places, cut the Peking-Hankow railway, destroy coal mines and even carry out attacks into Manchuria. This major effort, using their forces in more conventional tactics, cost them 22,000 casualties which they could ill afford.\\"<br /><br />These conclusions contradict his later claim (made after talks with Halliday and Chang?) that \\"Communist supporters such as Edgar Snow had managed to persuade readers in the United States that Mao's forces were fighting hard while the corrupt Nationalists were doing little, when in fact the opposite was true.\\"<br /><br />Beevor writes of \\"the Great Leap Forward which killed more people than in the whole of the Second World War ... the seventy million victims of a regime that was in many ways worse than Stalinism\\". Is it too much to ask that he checks the facts, rather than just repeat Chang and Halliday's absurd lies?<br /><br />Beevor writes, \\"Relations between the western Allies and Stalin were bound to be fraught with suspicion. Churchill especially had promised far more military supplies than Britain was able deliver [sic]. And the American President's disastrous assurance to Molotov in May that they would launch a Second Front before the end of the year did more to poison the Grand Alliance than anything else. Stalin's paranoid tendencies persuaded him that the capitalist countries simply wanted the Soviet Union to be weakened while they waited.\\"<br /><br />Churchill had of course backed Roosevelt's promise. After the facts that Beevor cited, it seems a little rude to call Stalin paranoid for noticing these same facts and drawing the correct conclusion.<br /><br />Beevor ends by trying to blame Hitler and Stalin equally for the war. He calls the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany two `totalitarians', ignoring the crucial difference that the Soviet Union did all it could to prevent the most terrible war in history, while Nazi Germany did all it could to start it. Beevor is too mean-minded and hidebound to acknowledge that without Stalin and the Red Army we would all be living - if at all - in Hitler's concentration camps.<br /><br />This is not so much a history of the Second World War as a stream of anecdotes, verging all too often on war porn.else.

Beevor is too mean-minded and hidebound to acknowledge that without Stalin and the Red Army we would all be living - if at all - in Hitler's concentration camps.<br /><br />This is not so much a history of the Second World War as a stream of anecdotes, verging all too often on war porn.
0345803507|5.0|Men probably won't read these, but women certainly are!  Heard some statistics that about 9 months after these came out there was an increase in the birth of babies. Two main characters (Christian and Ana) take us on a wild frenzy of hot, steamy, adventurous sex.  Kinky things you may have daydreamed of trying are rampant in these books.<br />They are indeed page turners!
B008MM9630|5.0|I have been looking for a GOOD, fun &quot;farm&quot; game for awhile and this is it. I adore the graphics and the &quot;magical&quot; theme of the game. And finally a free game you can earn DECENT gems. I have no problem working fir gems except when you work days and days for only one. The only thing so far I feel is wrong in the game is lining things up together is a bit annoying and the biggest WRONG is all the animals except one cost A LOT of gems, now to all the people who constantly complain about real money for gems in all the games, you know ahead of time there are in game purchases.....you can set a password for children.....you DO NOT HAVE to buy them.....and the game is FREE. I sure hope a game this great keeps coming a long for free with options to buy gems or not. They do have to make money some how to keep the games coming. I would reccomend this game to anyone and hope they keep building on it!

1400069289|4.0|I found this book to be very entertaining and helpful. It's main message is we are the product of our habits and we can change our habits to get what we want in life. This is a powerful message because it puts the responsibility for changing in the hands of the reader and it gives some specifics on how to do that.<br /><br />I enjoyed the stories used to back up the theories (although some rambled a bit). What worked best for me were the discussions on individual habits and corporate habits. What worked least for me was the discussion on societal habits. Personally, I would've liked to have seen more time devoted to individual habits and more specifically how to change them. The book does provide a path yet I'd like to know more about how to identify negative keystone habits. Still, there is plenty of good and believable information to give a thinking person a great start and it's well worth a read. In other words, you can use this book as launchpad for changing negative habits and, therefore, your life.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great book.
B001XVCX96|4.0|I enjoyed this entertaining and informative film.  The acting was done very well, and the characters were developed enough that you were pulled through the film's grittiest and most violent scenes.  I usually opt to fast-forward through the tough scenes in these types of movies because the gore always outweighed whatever dialogue I might miss.  That was not the case for me during this film.  It was heart wrenching watching little boys, some no older than my oldest daughter, carrying weapons, being forced into doing drugs and alcohol, and killing anyone who opposed the rebels in their attempts to overthrow the current government, all in the name of greed and tyranny.  I hope that people watch this film and takes its message about conflict diamonds to heart.  While this is a dramatization of the events during that time, the issues and the warfare that it caused, were real.<br /><br />My one and only true complaint was that I wasn't able to watch in HD, even though I had purchased the HD version.  About 20 minutes into the film I started having difficulties with \\"buffering,\\" which is not something I usually encounter, and Amazon has a screening feature when you purchase HD versions, to determine whether or not you are capable of viewing the items in HD.  My system passed the screening (and always does), but I still had problems once I really got into the film and had to switch to the non-HD version.<br /><br />So, while this was a great film that I would recommend everyone to see, especially if you are interested in world affairs, I was not happy with the quality of the HD playback.  Purchase a hard-copy of the Blueray instead.
0439023513|2.0|** Spoilers Ahead ** Could not put this book down. I read it in a couple days, and it would have been just one if not for having kids to attend to. Collins did a masterful job of letting you think things had calmed down, only to be sucked back in at the end of each chapter with some HUGE news, or happening. You get to a point, as an adult I think, where who Katniss chooses doesn't matter anymore. The world has gone to hell, and who cares. The problem here is that when you get to the end (last two chapters or so) Collins just gives up. I've seen similar reviews. It's as if she spent so much time beautifully wrapping this package and then decides last minute she has to have a bow on it. So, she goes into the catch all closet and finds an old one that's pretty beat up, and worn out, but it's a bow. But it's terrible. I can't give this book a 1 star, it's too good up to the end, but I won't give it anymore than 2. The ending is just terrible. No commitment to anything. The death of Prim is handled poorly, a severe lack of attention. Same with the departure of Gale. Yes, the rift was forming, but for there to be no contact anymore, and just leaving him out, there was no effort there. I could not have cared less who Kat ended up with. The story began to transend any of that. Collins should have either left the bow off, or spent as much time on the bow as the rest of the story. Personally, I would have been happier with an epilogue of five years later, and Peeta showing up at the door. End. Leave it all to our imaginations, don't give a half-hearted attempt to make the sentimental ones happy, you leave us all disappointed.

0439023483|4.0|In a futuristic setting, the parallels of fiction grasp the reader as they relate to the emotions of physical existence. A tale of wilderness survival compounded by a game of Tributes and Careers. \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" meets \\"Lord of the Flies\\" meets \\"Spartacus\\"... on P.E.D.s! This pretense for The Hunger Games can only be described, nominally, as \\"Brilliance Noir\\". In the imposition of fate by lottery, the raconteur offers a perspective of indistinguishable fortitude and submission dosed with defiance. This is pronounced by the spry maturity of Katniss' voice, as the spirit of an arduous time in her life, as it pertains to the narrative zeitgeist of the history of Panem. In this way, our protagonista has generated an anthropological primary source to a developed \\"possible world.\\"<br /><br />The perspective of Katniss offers the reader little resistance to the savagery of Panem and the perils of the arena. This literary tool I found to be both captivating and liberating. As an outsider the very idea is barbarous and inhumane. From within the arena the imperative to participate seems essential; almost germane. The dichotomy of selflessness/sustainability is permeated by the concept of \\"tessera\\" as it relates to cooperative economics in a vastly codependent society. The barter system amongst Tributes could not have been more eloquently presented by Collins. The reality of survival deviates from non-fiction at the same time it personifies it.<br /><br />Irregular syntax in dialogue (and introspection) offers an abrupt euphony in perusing for flow. The acceptance of the sociological status quo by Panemanians is the gap that must be bridged by the reader in the abstraction of psychological themes. The administration of mythical Panem could be thought of as \\"post-historical/neo-democratic\\" in the sense that this future-primitive setting is both archaic as well as technologically advanced. This is exemplified in the contrast between the economies of the Hob and the firmamental holographic projections and hovercraft used by the Gamemakers. Although it is unclear as to how the Gamemakers can observe the events of the struggle and the players actions through the tree cover or even broadcast the games to the viewing citizens. I assume that the environmental controls are a similar object of this fiction.<br /><br />Overall, a well-bound and rounded-off installment as the first book in a series. Suspenseful and Satisfying!<br /><br />Text Excerpt pp. 310-311:<br /><br />\\"No more fear of hunger. A new kind of freedom. But then... what? What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food. Take that away and I'm not really sure who I am, what my identity is. The idea scares me some.\\"

B007Y5IAV0|2.0|First of all I love Serj, I love System, and I love Scars.  But as Serj releases these solo albums it seems someone is not around to keep him in check.  Some of these songs are downright embarassing.  I really didn't expect this from him.  One of my biggest criticisms has to do with him trying to jam any lyrics into a song and still have it be pleasing on some level.  I am beginning to wonder if he needed another vocalist to really bring the music into harmony,  Rather than Serj's ongoing chirp rap.  I love the guy but I have heard he is developing an ego about his music.  I hope not but on this album I can see it...
B0094K1JPC|5.0|Lighthearted comedy with GREAT INTERACTION between actress Rachel McAdams, Diane Keaton and actor Harrison Ford. Overall a very entertaining movie.
B0032SQCQI|3.0|I thought the premise of this movie looked interesting enough to give it a try. I thought the 1970's setting was a little weird at first, but they really made it work. I also felt like I was getting handed a spin on \\"Indecent Proposal\\" (will you do something REALLY immoral for money, and see if your marriage can survive?) but eventually it veered far enough away from that, that I was satisfied. I thought James Marsden and Cameron Diaz were wonderful; two young, beautitful actors who can both truly ACT. Refreshing! Their chemistry was genuine and felt completely natural.<br /><br />SPOILERS from here on out!<br /><br />The first half of the movie was enjoyable; mysterious, troubling, creepy. A few holes here and there (what man lets his wife answer the door alone at 5:45am??) but I was hanging with it. Then it all just got weirder and weirder. And as so many other reviewers stated, the weirdness wasn't the problem, it was the lack of explanation. For everything. Where did these \\"beings\\" come from? How did they work? How did they get into the gov't? Why were they targeting NASA families? Why were the \\"employees\\" everything from berserk to stalkerish to scared? What was with all the watery \\"portals\\"? How come nobody noticed these hordes of zombie-like people out in public, or that an entire motel was overrun with them? You don't have a few hundred zombies waddling down Main Street without being noticed by police or media. Why such a convoluted \\"test\\" instead of just obliterating the whole human race? Why did some of the \\"employees\\" suddenly break out of their... I dunno, mode?... and hurriedly give clues to Diaz and Marsden?<br /><br />Bleh. It had potential, and it is an enjoyably weird, Twilight Zone-ish thing. But if you're looking for depth, meaning, or even a sensible conclusion... you won't get them with this movie.
0345803485|2.0|Is this a joke? That's what you will be asking yourself from page one to keep the pages turning.<br />Bella. Oops. I mean Ana is clumsy, Introverted, loves the classics, and never been interested in a man. Until she meets Edward. Oops. I mean Christian, who is Mr. perfect, and tormented or not, a darn good catch for any woman out there, and not obusive at all. We meet Jacob early in Jose, and Jessica is Kate. Ana's best father, loves fishing and her mother is hairbrained and on mate number five. I believe.<br />Not to mention almost direct quotes taken from Twilight.<br />I'm not good for you Bella. Oops. I mean Ana. And almost direct quotes Bella gave him back. I have never seen such a direct copycat before.<br />This was inspired by Twilight. Except switch the Vamp, for a sex maniac.<br />The writing is messed up and the sex is way overkilled. I beleive their was a six plus page scene forty percent into the book, and then constant smaller after, none of which are sexy. This could be ok, since it could teach women about BDSM or whatever, but it doensn't. Not the first long one anyway.<br /><br />On the bright side, there is a interesting, creative contract that Bella is tempted to sign, that could be scarry, depending on how you look at it. This and the deep rooted problems to Edward have some teeth and could grab people enough to get to book two, where I belive Christian must steal the show.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />The trailers were so lush and beautiful, you really expected an epically grand tale to be told here. And while the costumes, sets, and scenery were all breathtaking, the plot fell flat. Hard.<br /><br />Charlize Theron was lovely and psychotic, but everyone else was... bland. Kristen Stewart? Please. She is nowhere near as beautiful as Theron, let alone MORE beautiful. It's obvious the producers were banking on riding her \\"Twilight\\" tails and hoping Twi-hard fans would fill the theater. And while I enjoy Stewart as an actress, she is somewhat one-dimensional; she does well with dark, gritty, angsty movies. She's too sulky and reserved to make an endearing or likeable Snow White, even a tough one. Compare her with Lily Collins (\\"Mirror, Mirror\\") who was both ridiculously beautiful AND exquisitely charming... there IS no comparison.<br /><br />There also seemed to be this wanna-be love triangle thingie between Snow White, the Huntsman, and William (Snow's childhood sweetheart/friend). But it never goes anywhere. Nobody falls in love with anybody. Nobody winds up with anybody. It didn't make sense. There's all this gazing and sighing and romantic introspection, and then... that's it. Huh?<br /><br />By the way, what is the white plaster-of-Paris stuff that Theron bathes in? Yes, it's striking and beautiful to watch, but WHAT is it? Milk? It's too thick and coating to be milk. Not sure what else it COULD be...<br /><br />In the end, the movie dragged on too long, tried to follow too many mini-plots (the Duke, the rebels, the dwarves, the fairy-critters, the scarred-face women), and ultimately felt exhausting and predictable. We know the fairy tale too well to be surprised by anything. I wished they'd veered away from the story everyone knows and thrown in some surprises. Somewhere. Something. Please! I still had about an hour of the film left, and I already knew what was coming; Snow White would fight the Queen, kill her, become Queen herself, happily ever after, tada. I was ready to turn it off at that point. Why watch the rest if I already knew what would happen?<br /><br />Sometimes a so-so movie is still entertaining enough that I'd say \\"go ahead and watch it, just for the fun factor\\". But I can't even say that about this one. Skip it and watch \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" instead. That movie was another disappointment, but at least it was fun to watch.

B004SBQGHS|4.0|I originally got this game over a year ago (when it was the free app of the day) and I've had hours of enjoyment since.  However, a lot has changed since then, so I feel a new review is warranted.<br /><br />The game is still good, but it's not quite as good as it used to be.  The game play is still that old mix of fun and frustration.  Slingshot birds at pigs and their consructs to clear the levels and advance.  Easier said than done at times.  ;)<br /><br />About the changes.  First, a lot of people complain about the \\"Toons\\" notifications that appear when you open the app.  Not really a problem, because those can be turned off.  To do so, simply click on the \\"gear\\" icon in the lower left of the screen and hit the \\"exclamation point\\" icon on the pop-up menu.  That disables the notifications.  Also, if you think those are \\"ads\\" and you're being lied to when you buy the ad free version, get over it.  The free version has ads for products that appear on the upper right of your screen when you're playing.  They never go away.  Plus, from time to time, you get a full screen video ad.  If you exit out of it, it takes you out of Angry Birds entirely, forcing you to reopen the app.  Those are ads.  This version doesn't have those.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  One of the newer additions to the game is a feature that allows you to create a Rovio account and save your progress and scores.  Fine, but I don't want to do that.  Since I haven't done that, a notification pops up periodically wanting me to do that.  Note to the developers:  if somebody doesn't do this the first time you ask, THEY PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO DO IT!  Continuing to bug me about it doesn't make me want to do it, it just makes me mad.  That annoying feature was worth taking off a star (my original rating was five.)<br /><br />Nitpicking: Look, developers, if I clear a level using only one bird, I should automatically get enough points to get three stars.  Clearing a level with one  bird and having three, four or five left and getting only two stars is complete bull.<br /><br />So, all in all, it's still good.  But not quite as good as it used to be.ur or five left and getting only two stars is complete bull.<br /><br />So, all in all, it's still good.  But not quite as good as it used to be.
0525953728|5.0|This account of the event is presented well, but I don't see why some critics of the book are wringing their hands over it's publication. There is nothing whatsoever that hasn't already been portrayed in a previous movie or novel regarding the military. I also find it telling that some of those with negative reviews readily admit they haven't even read the book. I think that perhaps some of those same people are whipping themselves into some sort of frenzy because the current president is not portrayed as an all-knowing, benevolent envoy of hope and change.<br />I received this title this morning on my Kindle, and read it in its entirety in a couple of hours or so. Good job!

B004S9AK3G|5.0|Another great novel to curl up with as this was another book I couldn't put down. A great sequel to Pillars and I loved how the characters connected to each other between sequels. Reading a book and getting involved with a character and thinking AWWWWWW come on just  hurry up and marry the bloke was like watching a love story at the movies when the character dosen't follow their hearts but their duty! Ha sooo frustrating.

0345423496|4.0|Frank Poole, or rather, the body of Frank Poole, has been floating through space for a long time. After nearly 1000 years, he's picked up by a comet mining ship and his vacuum preserved body returned to life via medical technology available in 3001. Poole spends the first half of the novel examining and adjust to a future 1000 years beyond the time in which he live, before embarking on a flight to Ganymede with the crew that rescued him. Upon arrival, he's able to \\"hijack\\" a shuttle and set down on Europa, which has been denied to mankind since the warning from the Starchild (Dave Bowman) in 2010. Poole, however, is allowed to land and overjoyed to find that his old crew mate, Bowman, and the ship AI, HAL, are both still \\"alive\\" (and linked to the Europan Monolith) and despite their combined persona and 1000 years of incorporeal existence, remember him. However, the happy reunion is disturbed years later when \\"Halman\\" again communicates with Poole, informing him that the \\"supervisor\\" monolith 450 light years away has sent new information to the local (Europan) monolith, and the information it has sent does not bode well for humanity. Poole and \\"Halman\\" find themselves the only hope to save humanity from what may be a malfunctioning monolith.<br /><br />There are a lot of negative reviews for this novel and honestly I can understand why. I was in the same boat about halfway through but had a bit of a revelation. 3001: The Final Odyssey isn't so much a short novel as it is a really long prologue for the entire 20xx series. At first, 3001 felt like it was written by an author lost in the universe he'd created. Clarke isn't the first and wont be the last author to fall into that trap. As a fan of many sci-fi and fantasy authors, I've seen it happen before. Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind...it happens to quite a few good authors, even the occasional master like Clarke. After thinking about it for awhile though, 3001 grew on me. It doesn't tie up all the loose ends, and it treats some of them in a manner that doesn't make a lot of people very happy, but ultimately I was okay with that. Sometimes things don't work out how we want them to and that seems to be the road Clarke took - this many not be what you wanted, but it's what happened.<br /><br />For sure, a lot of the novel is spent as a political and religious outlet for Clarke in his later years. Yes, the conclusion can be seen as unsatisfactory and one can almost hear Jeff Goldblum in the background repeating his line from Independence Day; \\"we'll give it a virus...a computer virus...\\" but in the end, 3001 brings the 20xx line of stories to a conclusion that may not satisfy everyone, but really should be seen as a ray of hope - Humanity, given freedom to develop as it will.treats some of them in a manner that doesn't make a lot of people very happy, but ultimately I was okay with that.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Battery HD Free is an awesome app for my Kindle Fire. I am no longer caught off guard by the 15 minutes of battery left warning. When I settle down with my Kindle Fire, I can check how much battery time I have so I can decide if I should plug in or not. I like that it tells battery time based on your planned activity.<br /><br />I have been using this app since May 2012 and really appreciate it.

B008K9SG9K|5.0|Ever since Imagine Dragons released their CONTINUED SILENCE EP, listeners have been hungry for more tracks from the band.  Their first full-length album, NIGHT VISIONS, meets the lofty expectations the band set for themselves with their debut release.  Imagine Dragons have an indie sensibility that is compounded with a arena-rocking sound that makes them accessible, but not cheap.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Radioactive,\\" a song that should sound familiar to listeners who have been following the band for a while now.  The mix here is slightly different than past releases, so listeners that bought CONTINUED SILENCE won't be slighted by its appearance here.  The album's lead single \\"It's Time\\" is full of energy - complete with handclaps and mandolin riffs, the song is accessible and infectious.  It also appeared on their EP, but it sounds just as fresh on this full-length album.  Following it is \\"Demons,\\" another song that appeared on the band's EP; it's a heart-on-the-sleeve slow-rocker, but it's completely satisfying.  \\"On Top of the World\\" straddles a line between joyous/beat and stadium-rocking.<br /><br />The vocals of \\"Amsterdam\\" give it a slightly soulful edge - it feels like new territory for the band, and it's a welcome detour.  The song starts pretty soft but gradually gets louder and louder.  \\"Bleeding Out\\" serves as an album highlight, and it's just as raw or rough as anything the band has released before.  Imagine Dragons delves into their pop sensibilities with \\"Underdog,\\" a song that is tinged with electronics and synthesizers.  For me, this song stood out compared to the rest - it didn't work for me, but others might dig it.  \\"Nothing Left to Say\\" and \\"Rocks\\" are two songs sharing the same track (about 9 minutes long overall).  \\"Nothing Left to Say\\" is a slower-burning song that isn't as percussive as the rest of the album - it's a great song made greater by the haunted atmosphere the band provides.  The song's final notes lead into the more uplifting and uptempo \\"Rocks.\\"  \\"Rocks\\" finds the band experimenting with mandolin again - it's a great, fun ending to a consistently satisfying album.<br /><br />Many of the better tracks here were previously released on CONTINUED SILENCE - I can't fault the band for that though.  NIGHT VISIONS is a satisfying release that should catapult Imagine Dragons into the arena-rock stratosphere.  Fans of AWOLNATION or Alex Clare will love this album.  Essential tracks: \\"[[ASIN:B0092MKFU2 Radioactive]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B0092MKUNY It's Time]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0092MKK3Y Nothing Left To Say / Rocks]].\\"  Eager to hear what the band will come up with next!fting and uptempo \\"Rocks.\\"  \\"Rocks\\" finds the band experimenting with mandolin again - it's a great, fun ending to a consistently satisfying album.<br /><br />Many of the better tracks here were previously released on CONTINUED SILENCE - I can't fault the band for that though.

1609611543|5.0|I've now been 12 weeks wheat-free.  I've lost 21 lb. and, according to the freshly-drilled holes in my belt, much of it's from the belly.  I missed four things at the start: fresh bread, crackers, pizza and pasta.  It took less than two weeks to Google and fine-tune every recipe I needed; most of them are better than the recipes in the book.  My diet now includes sandwiches, hummus-loaded crackers and Italian meals as tasty as any I've eaten.  I sleep better, have more energy (which my Border Collie appreciates) and - this is really interesting - I do believe my memory is improving.<br />My only disappointment has been neanderthal responses from Amazon \\"reviewers,\\" some of whom have not read Wheat Belly - and others who have clearly not read it with the care such a life-changing book deserves.  Despite Dr. Davis's clear language, some insist on reading \\"Consume in limited quantities\\" as \\"Avoid like the plague.\\"  Innocent review readers are misled into thinking that dairy, whole corn, fruits and legumes are to be avoided, instead of, well, consumed in limited quantities.<br />With any other product, sloppy observations are annoying.  Given the importance of Wheat Belly to our health (just keep reading these reviews folks; they are not from fiction writers) such ignorance is potentially destructive.  Why anyone would deliberately dissuade other humans from getting the kind of help that could save their lives is totally beyond me.
B008GX2YQQ|4.0|MERRIWEATHER POST PAVILION is a masterpiece of an album. It's an album that feels like an anomaly -- like the stars had aligned just right for the band to make it. There was a sense upon listening to MERRIWEATHER that Animal Collective would never make another album like it, and in subsequent years, this has been true. The FALL BE KIND EP was a darker affair that moved away from the concise pop of their previous full-length album; ODDSAC was a visual album (created in collaboration with Danny Perez) that ranks among some of the most psychedelic output of the band. So now, three years later, Animal Collective releases their full-length followup to MERRIWEATHER: CENTIPEDE HZ.<br /><br />Compared to past albums, CENTIPEDE HZ feels a bit more song-centric than previous albums have. These songs don't hold the same atmospheric/ambient qualities that past output of Animal Collective use, especially in comparison to FALL BE KIND. Instead, this album feels like the band is throwing every sound they can into a blender -- at times, it feels messy, but it never feels disorganized. There's a method to the band's madness that allows songwriters Panda Bear and Avey Tare to craft great pop songs covered in psychedelic and noisy trappings. Shifting between electronic synthesizers, percussion, and samples/loops, it definitely feels like an Animal Collective record: highly rhythmic and at times primitive, it's the psychedelic pop that listeners have come to expect from the band. CENTIPEDE HZ is the longest album the group has recorded since their debut, but it never feels drawn out or long.<br /><br />CENTIPEDE HZ announces itself with opening track \\"Moonjock.\\" With the opening seconds of this track, it's apparent that this is going to be different than MERRIWEATHER -- it's stomping beat launches a bouncey and infectious melody. The lead single, \\"Today's Supernatural\\" continues the band's manic progress. Avey Tare's motif \\"Let let let let let go!\\" is impossible to ignore, and it gives off the impression that the band is reinvigorated and revitalized. Another standout is \\"Father Time;\\" the song's funky rhythm leads into some incredible melodic moments. Using a perfect blend of sample/loops and organic instrumentation, it hits a satisfying sweet spot. \\"New Town Burnout\\" stumbles a bit in trying to find its footing - it's notably slower than other tracks here, and the melody never quite reaches that of its neighbors. CENTIPEDE HZ doesn't venture much into the darkness, except perhaps with \\"Mercury Man,\\" a song that feels both haunted and paranoid. The closing \\"Amanita\\" shines in a few spots with an interesting last-half, but for the most part, it's affectless in its delivery. It's a somewhat disappointing ending to the album (as compared to MERRIWEATHER's \\"Brother Sport\\" or FALL BE KIND's \\"I Think I Can.\\"<br /><br />After listening to CENTIPEDE HZ, I was left exhausted. It's just shy of an hour long, but there's not a wasted moment of the album: nearly every second is packed with something interesting. Mixed with songs of every volume and speed, Animal Collective have left no sound uncovered in making this record. It's not as consistent as some past releases, but it's a strong album that warrants multiple listens.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest Animal Collective fan, and I loved this album - chances are, if you like the band, there will be plenty moments-of-interest here. If you're unfamiliar with the band, I would recommend starting with the ultra-accessible MERRIWEATHER POST PAVILION before making the leap to other releases. If you're among the ranks of listeners who didn't see what all the fuss has been about - this isn't the album to win you to Animal Collective's side.

B008GX2YQQ|4.0|Trying to review the new Animal Collective album \\"Centipede Hz\\" without reference to its generation defining predecessor \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\" is nigh on impossible. The phrase \\"chalk and cheese\\" doesn't come close. Having listened to this album streamed over the AC \\"Centipede Radio\\" for the past five days is akin to one of those horrible change curves that management theorists can get very excited about. You start off in a mild state of shock. What the hell is this noise, why are we being bombarded by all these tinny frequencies, where is the presence of any low end bass on the album and where is My Girls 2? The next stage is anger and depression. Come on Panda Bear and Avey Tare you surely can do better than this? Everything about MPP was borderline perfection, it was like Brian Wilson had really finished \\"Smile\\" but went to Berlin, had it produced by Kraftwerk, bumped into Spiritualized on the way and pinched some unreleased tapes from Super Furry Animals and asked Eno to mix. Where are the big production values, the experimental dance music, the shimmering, bell-like tones strung out and stretched against a backdrop of huge micro-beats and most of all the massive sense of fun with \\"Daily Routine\\" staking a claim for the indie national anthem of the noughties.<br /><br />Then suddenly integration and acceptance slopes in. \\"Centipede Hz\\" creeps up you like a stealth bomber. A hand grenade is taken to the expansive MPP sound and instead garage pop rock is the order of the day with certain songs screaming for your attention in the same way \\"For Reverend Green\\" from Strawberry Jam burrowed up your musical drainpipe. The opener \\"Moonjock\\" which starts with industrial drumming until the hugely recognisable vocals of Tare and Lennox creep in and all of a sudden so do some lovely melodies albeit amidst a bewildering cacophony of sound. Possibly the one potential \\"hit\\" on the album is \\"Todays Supernatural\\" which actually sounds like a Phoenix song and is excellent. It is followed by the brilliantly quirky \\"Rosie Oh\\" full of Syd Barrett influences and again a infectious pop song that repays repeated listens. When it comes to \\"Applesauce\\" if the production values had been boasted and made bigger it could have happily fitted on MPP, while the song \\"Wide eyed\\" marks the return to the group of Josh `Deakin' Dibb although its one of those songs easier to admire than love, it could however be a grower. The spirit of Van Dyke Parks haunts \\"Father time\\" but again this is not a great song. Much better by far is the chilly anthem \\"New town burnout\\" which clicks along with a great Tare vocal and strong hooks. The challenging \\"Monkey riches\\" has so much going on its difficult to find a decent starting part. One thing for certain is no other group is trying this hard to be boundary spanners and open new doors. Indeed \\"Mercury Man\\" appears to achieve the feat of being completely obtuse and maddenly catchy at the same time, while to these ears the bubbly \\"Pulleys\\" could well be one of the albums standout tracks. The whole thing is rounded off by \\"Aminata\\" full of weird squeaks, bursts of percussion and a lifting melody struggling to get out until around four minutes when it sounds like a Cossack dance on ecstasy.<br /><br />Health Warning - if you hated \\"Merriweather Post Pavilion\\" do not touch \\"Centipede Hz\\" with a one mile long bargepole. The words \\"kings new clothes\\" will be used with rapier like incision and your beloved reviewer cursed into hades deepest pit. Alternatively if you loved \\"Strawberry Jam\\" this may intrigue and eventually carve out a warm place in your affections. By any objective definition this is an album that stands in a giant shadow cast by its predecessor which inevitably steals some of its light, but did anyone really expect or desire a similar follow up? Animal Collective alongside Grizzly Bear remain one of the most intriguing and original bands on the planet prepared to make huge mistakes if that means not sounding like every other indie clone or nu folk copyist, but always producing the best modern sounds for modern days. \\"Centipede Hz\\"is by any standards a brilliant failure and sometimes celebrating those who try hardest but don't always win is the one of the most important values we have.g like every other indie clone or nu folk copyist, but always producing the best modern sounds for modern days. \\"Centipede Hz\\"is by any standards a brilliant failure and sometimes celebrating those who try hardest but don't always win is the one of the most important values we have.
1476712042|2.0|The thing about Beautiful Disaster is that it had so many...unrealistic things going on, so I know I shouldn't like it, but on the other hand, there's a lot of stuff going on that makes me love it. It's that drama-filled book that honestly seems as if it would be better as a script for a movie, rather than a book. But it was so fun to read through and you know how in certain books/movies your chest feels all achy? I can name 3 parts where that happened to me! But eep! this was one disturbing book sometimes.<br /><br />Honestly, the relationship was so...wrong. Completely messed up. They were best friends. Then they made a bet which Abby lost, so she stayed at Travis's apartment for a month. At the end of the month, they do it. Then she leaves in the middle of the night. Then he's pissed. then (I think. I kind of got a bit disturbed) they get together. Then they're the talk of the school and a guy hits on Abby. And Travis literally hits the guy in the face. Hmmm...and after that, it gets more dramatic and more twisty. And a bit more messed up. But it was sweet and the times they broke up (...mainly because of Abby now that I think of it.) was so extremely sad.<br /><br />Travis is extremely violent and possessive, but there's something abou thim which makes you love him. (No matter how many people he punches...) Abby was actually really annoying sometimes, but I, for some strange reason, was always on her side when she and Travis broke up. Meh.<br /><br />And even though this is Contemporary, there is no way any of this would actually happen. It's something that you'd wish could happen, but know it can't. But I really wish it could! It's one of those books which mainly teens will enjoy, adults not so much. You read it and if you don't overthink it, you'll love it for sure! But once you start wondering the whys and hows...it turns out not to be so good after all.

B00136JPB0|5.0|I could go on & on about this album & the incredible impact Jeff Buckley has had on my life, but I'll simply say it all started in the summer of 1994, when the single Last Goodbye came on a late night radio show. 18 years later, this is still my favourite album & favourite artist, hands down. Jeff had amazing vocal range (4 octaves!), could play multiple instruments, and wrote music in a way that made you truly feel every note; every word. The first 3 songs (\\"Grace\\", \\"Mojo Pin\\", & \\"Last Goodbye\\") are some of my favs on this album but my all time favourite is \\"Lover, you should've come over\\". It's a truly moving, powerful song. Again, I could go on & on about how incredible this diverse, artistic album is, but maybe the best endorsement for many people is the list of other musicians & famous people who cite him as an influence. A few of those include: MUSE, Radiohead, Chris Cornell, P.J. Harvey, Rufus Wainwright, Robert Pattinson, Jamie Cullum, Damon Gough, Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt, Elizabeth Fraser, Chrissie Hynde, Patti Smith, Katie Melua, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Fran Healy, Steve Hogarth, & Bj&ouml;rk... and that's just to name a few!

I predicted 2 out of my top 5, while the other 3 describes me perfectly too.<br /><br />However, it feels like a scam. $15 for a book with 5 qualities that comes from a 122 questionnaire found online. You have to pay for the rest of the trait order, and I've been told it's something like $500. Why can't they charge a smaller amount, and let you take the quiz online? The book is quite small. There is about 1.5 pages each on each trait. You are given a pdf printout anyway, won't hurt to double it to a 10 page pdf.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's still a great test to take, and I think it'll help me a long way when I'm interviewing by giving me some introspection in my strengths, how to complement others, and how to work on my weaknesses too.<br /><br />EDIT 9.18.2012: It's actually $550 to learn your traits 6-34, because their policy states that they want to release those traits as a full program, including a consulting session with a an expert representative.

B002NEFL8W|2.0|It just makes no sense why Canon made a better grip for the 60D (the BG-E9) than they did for the 7D (BG-E7).  The BG-E9 has a VERY nice, sloped and generous area for your fingers to wrap around the front, which is made possible by the side-loading battery tray design. There is also a larger \\"knob\\" at the top where shutter release is and your middle finger supports the camera weight. The BG-E9 also has a sliding power switch, while the BG-E7 requires a two-handed operation (or you have to set the camera down). So, I recommend an aftermarket grip, many of which offer the same exact form and features, at a quarter of the cost of the Canon.    There is another competing unit called the Vertax, made by Pixel, which has a very similar design to the the BG-E9.  My only gripe with that one is that the left side of the unit (looking from the back) is flat and doesn't wrap nicely along the bottom of the camera, making it look like it was cobbled together, just sitting on a flat shelf.  I ended up returning that one because of this design issue and the rubber coating was not properly glued on in a couple of corners. If they ever correct the design issue I'll be buying another right away.    ========    [Update Feb 2015] Vertax updated their design last year and now has the proper form to match the form of the 7D.

The premise intrigued me. Although it's the length of two novels, I flashed through it in just a few days. And I was hooked all the way through.<br /><br />Mr. King has created a 5-genre novel. It's a sci-fi/fantasy time-travel tale. It's also deeply researched historical fiction. The second half of the novel focuses on a touching romance. It's also a thriller with the violence of a horror story. Fantasy, history, romance, thriller, horror. A harmonic convergence of story elements.<br /><br />A wonderfully satisfying novel.

0525953728|2.0|I have researched and read every book on the Bin Laden Raid, and after working over four months closely with a \\"REAL\\" Navy Seal team I can attest that the official unspoken rule is that Seals never kill and tell and to do so would be considered an act of treason, this is the greatest breach of trust any soldier can commit against his country.  This act alone is in violations of everything he stands for and the trust placed upon him, but Owen does not stop there, he clearly reveals details  that are much more political in nature almost as to humiliate the US Government and Military. I feel that he has disgraced all of those that have worked so long and so hard.  What he did in the raid my have been a brave thing, not unlike the thousands that have already sacrificed for their country, but to bad month our leaders and reveal our internal chain of command structure that clearly enlightens the enemy is nothing less than treason. I am very disappointed that a Seal would be so reckless. The book comes across as though it was written by a disgruntled employee, it really smells. There's not a lot of new info here, except for which side of the head the bullet went through,  did we blow half his head off, was he dead when he hit the ground? I would have been much happier if he had kept the political crap to himself and focused on what a great country we are, and that we are a team that works together. This book reminds me of the closing of the movie \\"Platoon\\" where Charlie Sheen says \\"we didn't fight the enemy, we fought ourselves and the enemy was within us\\" I get a sense that Owen doesn't know how to play well with others and using this opportunity for his own political agenda. It's a shame.

The rhythm is exquisite.<br /><br />After hearing \\"Trick of the Tale\\" the first time through I loved it, but didn't really understand why.  By the third time through it I was familiar and could identify my favorite songs.  Those favorite songs have changed over and over though the past 21 years but they've always been on that album.  Okay, I'm fibbing a little--\\"Supper's Ready\\" was my favorite for a few years--but these days I find myself humming \\"Mad Man Moon\\" or \\"Trick of the Tail\\" more often than \\"Supper's Ready.\\"<br /><br />Get this CD and listen to it all the way through, then do it again.  You will be happy and you'll have years of enjoyment ahead of you because these songs never get old.

B003VB5E2E|4.0|Some great performances on this Blu Ray.  Sound and picture is very good and I'm glad I have this in my collection.  I guess it just comes down to who you do and don't appreciate as an artist.  Just press skip!  Some awesome, some good and some okay performances on here... (I personally don't like ZZ top, but hey, not everybody likes me either!).  All the performances I don't like are made up for the ones I do.  Also, I gotta agree with a previous comment on here - The crowd is really lame!  Personal highlights - Jeff Beck, Ronnie Wood/Buddy Guy, Bill Murray, Eric Clapton/Steve Winwood and a couple of others too.  I find I only go back to the performances I like, rather than watching the entire concert, but seeing how long it is I guess this is what you'd do on the day too... Why not grab a couple of beers in between your favourites??? 4 stars :)

0345803507|1.0|This book is so disturbing! How anyone could give it 5 stars and call it romance is beyond me.<br /><br />Here are the problems...<br /><br />Christian Grey is abusive. Plain and simple.<br /><br />Why? Well, let's see if we can make some comparisons between an abusive man and Grey, shall we?<br /><br />FACT: An abusive man isolates his gf/wife from the world<br /><br />GREY: Isolates Ana from all her friends. In the first book, she still had her friends. By the time we reach this final book, she has to ask permission to see her friends. Yes, she has to ask PERMISSION to see her friends!<br /><br />FACT: An abusive man punishes his gf/wife when she disobeys him<br /><br />GREY: When Ana takes off her bikini top at the beach, Grey punishes her by \\"branding\\" her body with hickeys, so that she can't suntan anymore. Also, when Ana has a drink with Kate at a bar even though Grey forbade her, he punishes her in the bedroom by not letting her come, forcing her to use a safe word.<br /><br />FACT: An abused woman always makes excuses for her bf/husband's behavior<br /><br />ANA: She always make excuses for Grey as well. When he refuses to let her keep her last name at work, it is because he is insecure. Because he is weak. Because he was abused as a child. Blah-blah-blah<br /><br />Who in their right mind finds this romantic? Christian Grey is not some ideal fantasy man that women can wish they had; he is a sick and twisted man disguised in a very handsome package.<br /><br />If their abusive relationship isn't disturbing enough, we also have the writing. It is AWFUL! Where the hell was the editor? What kind of editor would allow such poorly written garbage to be published? Unbelievable.<br /><br />This book is nothing like Twilight. It is sick and twisted. And it glorifies abuse. Disgusting! Seriously!<br /><br />I would not recommend this book. And the women who finds this romantic...yeah, you scare me. You really do.

B003Y5H5EW|3.0|I'm a huge Underworld fan, but this one didn't really cut it. I enjoyed it and found it hilarious because everyone around me so obviously hated every minute of it. It's cheesy, does nothing to advance the series' mythology, and changes the dynamic of the series enough to irritate some fans. Decent enough action though.
1476712042|4.0|I've seen this book in circulation for a while and was always curious about it, but there was always another book(s) i was more into. I couldn't put energy into another book if i was so deep on a series. I am glad i finally got the chance to read Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire!!! I couldn't put it down! i felt invested in the characters and couldn't wait to see what happened next. The story centers around a young college freshman from Kansas named, Abby Abernathy. the book starts off with a bang. within the first chapter you meet Travis Maddox and bad boy and notorious playboy at Eastern university. the chemistry between the two characters you can sense form the very beginning. because the book started off the way it did, it is one of the reasons i was hooked and wanted to keep reading. in most books (series or stand alone) it builds up the drama and the romance. i feel like you have to push through the heavy parts to get to the yummy center. with Beautiful Disaster i didn't have to wait long. maybe it was that way for me. i finished more than half the book before my eyes begged to fall asleep.  the book was refreshing in a way i never would have expected. i would definitely read this book again. and even though i have the kindle version, i will absolutely get the print version. i can't wait to see what Travis's P.O.V will be like...

B008QE9XD2|2.0|Saw this at the theater and wasn't too thrilled. I loved the original show. But this was just okay. I couldn't decide if this was supposed to be a comedy or drama. More comedy would have been great. Or all drama would have been great. But the mixture of the two was not so well done in this movie. Being a Depp fan and a fan of the original Dark Shadows, I will be purchasing the DVD in hopes that after I've watched it again, I may find what was missing at the theater. Who knows? Maybe my popcorn was bad and tainted my judgment!
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I laughed and laughed!!  What a surprise!!  I have rented this again and I never do that.  It was funny but not stupid humor.  I enjoyed from start to finish.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|It is absolutely amazing musicle, I have seen and heard in recent years. Too bad it's in French, not in English language, but if one have seen or heard the songs in English, than one is understand the songs and the lyrics. The music is one of the kind, you marvell. I'm very happy, that I've bought it.<br />Thanks to Amazon.com.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|this cover clips on easily and the magnetic cover does a good job of protecting the screen, the bright color makes it easy to spot.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|We needed to see this movie because we had just seen in the movies the Avengers and we really didn't know much about Captain America.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This movie stretched the book as far as it could while maintaining the story. Unable to use the inner monologues that the book was written with, it has to utilize other storytelling mechanisms to explain the foreign aspects in the movie, mostly all those parts of an alternative society with different rules, animals, culture, etc.<br /><br />What is unforgivable was the liberal use of modifications to the ultimate plot in what seems like an attempt to make this movie palatable to elementary school children, as well as sell its sequels. Because they couldn't drag it out for five hours, they focused extremely superficially on many parts, and rather than glance over everything they should have cut what they weren't going to introduce and carry out thoroughly.<br /><br />The revolution ideas were overhyped in the film, whereas they weren't really introduced until the end of the second book. The just seemed to be pushing the ideas that will come out in the second and third movies.<br /><br />IMHO, the acting, particularly in the first 20 mins or so was atrocious. It seemed like more of a college project than a Hollywood film, and they should have cast it better. The constuming was bizarre and extravagant, a little distracting in scenes that seemed like they were trying to make serious.<br /><br />It was an interpretation of the book, but it is shameful to say this is the best that could have been done for the money they blew on this.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|this is a good game but many times the board will freeze and the time keeps.ticking. then it will catch up with the moves I made and then time is up. annoying!!!  HTC one x.
140120841X|4.0|I had seen and enjoyed the movie, and while I am an avid reader, I don't normally read graphic novels. I actually found this book more difficult to read than a traditional novel, being used to reading text only and visualizing the scenes internally. Notwithstanding this, it was an enjoyable if a long read.<br /><br />The plot of the book is significantly longer and more inclusive than the movie, which would be expected, though the characters themselves sometimes have different identities and personalities altogether, or are entirely omitted from the movie.<br /><br />While I found the movie quite satisfying, I think the additional plotlines and story were better developed in the book. A good read if you enjoyed the movie.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Imagine growing up in a world controlled by cruel, selfish alpha males who insist on their way and know how to make everyone else comply and keep how they feel to themselves.  A world where a young person is not even given the opportunity to speak their mind, less any reward for doing so.  This is the world of the White Ribbon.  The answers to the mysteries of the crimes in the village are of little import here, it is the psychological environment that punishes anyone that might reveal any truth here that is the point, and none of the children dare risk it.<br /><br />The film is brilliant, subtle and a fascinating study of psychological, dare I say it, \\"terrorism?\\". Not for everyone, it's clear that many viewers get stuck on the idea that it's a \\"whodunit.\\". This is not Sherlock Holmes, but more Sigmund Freud.  It's not a whodunit, get that out of your mind or you'll completely miss what the movie is about.<br /><br />And I would say the points are timely, in the modern world where the War on Whistleblowing is in full swing, and coverups of crimes at the top are the norm.  If the government has nothing to hide, then why so ferociously attack the whistleblower?

B000002OX5|5.0|\\"The Who Sell Out\\" isn't the Who's most rocking album; that's \\"Live at Leeds.\\" It's not one of the band's full-on rock operas -- \\"Tommy\\" and \\"Quadrophenia.\\" It's not their most \\"complete\\" album, lyrically and musically; that would be \\"Who's Next.\\" But without a doubt, it's the most fun.<br /><br />\\"Sell Out\\" takes as its conceit the idea that you're listening to \\"Radio London,\\" one of London's great \\"pirate\\" radio stations from the 1960s. Some of them actually did broadcast, apparently, from seagoing ships -- Radio London transmitted from a ship anchored in the North Sea -- so the name was apt. And so, in addition to the great songs, the Who programs into the mix some fake (and real, it turns out) commercial jingles. The classic \\"I Can See For Miles,\\" for example, is preceded by a short little ditty that goes like this: \\"Hold your group together / With Rotosound Strings!\\" Who bassist John Entwistle really did use Rotsounds, and the company remains in business to this day.<br /><br />Other jingles on \\"Sell Out\\" include \\"Heinz Baked Beans,\\" no explanation needed; \\"Odorono,\\" a song promoting a fictitious deodorant, and \\"Medac\\" for an acne cream.<br /><br />But without real songs -- and really good songs -- \\"Sell Out\\" would not continue to be held in such high esteem. It featured some tremendous tunes, including the snarling \\"Armenia City in the Sky,\\" the innuendo-laced \\"Mary Anne With the Shaky Hands\\" (think about it), the aforementioned raving and rocking \\"I Can See For Miles,\\" and some genuinely great pop balladry as evidenced by \\"Our Love Was\\" and \\"Tattoo.\\" There was also a Pete Townshend solo track -- the starkly beautiful \\"Sunrise,\\" featuring just Townshend's voice instead of lead singer Roger Daltrey's, accompanied by Townshend's guitar.<br /><br />\\"Sell Out\\" was not, alas, the album that made the Who worldwide stars; the band would have to wait till \\"Tommy\\" for that. But it's clearly their greatest early record, surpassing \\"My Generation\\" and \\"A Quick One\\" for sheer wit and songwriting ability.<br /><br />And besides ... it's just so ... much ... FUN.heer wit and songwriting ability.<br /><br />And besides ... it's just so ... much ... FUN.

030758836X|4.0|WARNING # 1: Gillian Flynn is addictive. Don't blame me if you suddenly start spending too much time reading her books. If you read \\"Gone Girl,\\" you might as well just plan on reading \\"Dark Places\\" and \\"Sharp Objects,\\" too, because that's what will happen to you.<br /><br />WARNING # 2: Gillian Flynn is disturbing. I mean that in a good way. The people that populate her places are nowhere near ... normal. I realized this as soon as it became clear to me that the narrator of her first book was what some folks call a \\"cutter.\\" Fortunately, Flynn is such a good writer that she can make such subjects seem ... well, I don't know that I'd go so far as to say \\"enjoyable,\\" but \\"interesting\\" certainly applies!<br /><br />WARNING # 3: Gillian Flynn will keep you up at night. She is one of those \\"can't put this down\\" authors. If you're going to start one of her books, you'd just better plan on being up later than you thought you would. Make sure you have the next day off work, or, if you don't, try to ensure that you have a) a boring meeting you can nod off in without coworkers noticing; b) a Webinar to watch alone at your desk, and one that's completely unimportant; or c) a project you've been dilly-dallying on, and on which you can dilly-dally some more. ;)<br /><br />Other things Gillian Flynn does right:<br /><br />-- She understands small towns. I'm a native Missourian, so TRUST me on this one -- yes, Carthage, Missouri, really IS like this. I grew up partly in small towns. The whole nature of that existence is that everybody is up in your business. You either learn to thrive on that kind of thing, or you leave.<br /><br />-- She writes concisely. Actually, \\"Gone Girl\\" is a bit longer than her previous books. That hasn't hurt her so far, but it could. It's hard to write good suspense and keep the level of tension tuned way up for too long. \\"Gone Girl\\" is a bit more complex, though, than what she's done so far, so in this case I'd say it's justified. I just don't really want to see her move into 500-plus-pages territory.<br /><br />-- She follows that adage \\"write what you know.\\" She grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, and lives in Chicago now. She sets her books in the Midwest, and unlike other writers who just guess at how we hayseeds live out here, she actually gets it right. Without being condescending, either, which is much appreciated.<br /><br />Flynn has become -- deservedly so -- one of the most highly praised suspense writers of her generation. \\"Gone Girl\\" is her third GOOD book, and that's saying something. I hope we see many more novels from her.nt to see her move into 500-plus-pages territory.<br /><br />-- She follows that adage \\"write what you know.\\" She grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, and lives in Chicago now.

0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins brings new perspectives to the on-going religious debate. I encourage atheists and theists alike to read this thought-provoking novel. This book will definitely change your perspective on life and if you do not learn something from it, you're clearly doing it wrong. My only complaint is that Dawkins will sometimes use difficult or strange terminology (at least for here in the U.S.) so I encourage readers to keep a dictionary close-by.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I am a fan of Garth Nix.  I found Sabriel to be well paced and creatively written.  from the first page i could easily visualise the story, locales, and inhabitants of both The Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre.  I have since finished the two sequels  LIRAEL  and ABHORSEN.  An exciting and gripping trilogy.  NIX's style of leaving the story open ended gives hope for possible sequels or at the very least something similar.
B008M34INW|5.0|Use a little imagination to see studio bosses, producers, financiers, distributors, actors, and tabloid journalists.  This is Mel's very personal and sincere middle finger to all of them.  Even on a superficial level, it has new places and situations and gives a nod to all the gritty crime dramas and action heroes of 50 years ago without stealing much from any one.

No, we shouldn't condemn them based on one horrible month or year of high school.  She makes her mistakes and she takes her knocks.  Yes adults can be confused selfish jerks as well (that's the whole point of the film: the chaos that comes out of a complete lack of wise mentoring or role modeling.)

0525953728|5.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" by Mark Owen (a pseudonym) is published by Dutton Adult. It is the story of a Navy SEAL, an elite special operations warrior with its climax in the story of the raid and death of Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />Immediately striking is the author's ability to picture himself as a real, flawed person. He shows appreciation for others in his line of work without painting them as either unbelievably superhuman or as some kind of fringe military extremists. The characters are revealed to be dedicated to an intense level of self-discipline and while admitting to errors in performance, they have the persistence to improve their skills at the highest levels of military training and preparation in the world today. It is the very humanity of the characters that brought me into the story. It's a book about struggle and those who find the work-arounds to defeat.<br /><br />There is nothing in my reading of this book to signal the author is being deceitful or embellishing his role in warfare for personal gain. The author was straightforward in the introduction by informing the reader that he has taken necessary precautions for preventing the inadvertent release of classified information. He neither sets himself up as a some kind of national hero or as a potential platform for a future political career. It is smoothly written without being crass or overly graphic.<br /><br />As becomes evident, the author is motivated out of a desire to positively influence other young men to pursue their dreams regardless of whether it works out as military service or not. Owen's personal tale begins as a young man who was profoundly influenced by the reading of a book about a special operations predecessor. The author, if the story is to be believed, wanted nothing more to hone his skills and to experience the most he could by overcoming his weaknesses with the help of others. Indeed, iron sharpens iron.<br /><br />I have known similar men (Hal Moore and William Wingett, for example), with whom I've disagreed with their refusal and reluctance of being called \\"hero.\\" One theme that runs through my discussions with them is that even though the story is about their experience, they are more excited to describe the successes of those around them. They don't boast about themselves, but about camaraderie, struggle and the willingness of those around them to take on the most hazardous experiences with the sole determination of overcoming any obstacle. They show their heroism by stressing the success of others. And those of us who come after them learn we can achieve the seemingly impossible, because, quite simply, these guys have done the same and more.<br /><br />Overall, this book has provided me with great insight into how courageous people behave and think. This book provided me with a number of opportunities to reflect on what I perceive as heroism. This book by Mark Owen was inspirational.with whom I've disagreed with their refusal and reluctance of being called \\"hero.\\" One theme that runs through my discussions with them is that even though the story is about their experience, they are more excited to describe the successes of those around them.

B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|Personally, I love this movie. I'll admit, I'm a bit bias, though. I did grow up seeing and reading this book in school and I think the film is as beautiful an adaptation as any. I sent a copy of this to a friend for her young son and was shocked when she reported back that her family didn't like it. I'm pretty sure they turned it off and never finished it. It was, apparently, too creepy for her fiance. Yes, that's right, her fiance.  While I can admit that there are a couple scenes that do not follow the guidelines for your average, family, holiday film, I think \\"creepy\\" is a little too strong a word. Then again, that's what makes the world go around.<br /><br />I think this is a gorgeous, thoughtful movie that is deeper than many others. The music alone is wonderful, but the whole experience is artistic and meaningful. My family has made it a tradition to watch it every Christmas Eve. We'll be doing that for years and years to come.
B008JW1B5Y|4.0|Released Monday 3 September 2012 in the UK (22 July 2012 in the USA) - Concord Music Group, Inc 0888072339606 is release number eight in the 2011/2012 \\"STAX REMASTERS\\" CD Series and breaks down as follows (43:48 minutes):<br /><br />Tracks 1 to 12 are the album \\"Green Onions\\" - released October 1962 in the USA on Stax Records ST-701 [Mono] and July 1964 in the UK on London HA-K 8182 [Mono].<br /><br />Tracks 13 and 14 are BONUS TRACKS - \\"Green Onions (Live)\\" and \\"Can't Sit Down (Live)\\" which first appeared on the 1992 CD \\"Funky Broadway: Stax Review Live At The 5/4 Ballroom\\" (previously unreleased tracks at that time).<br /><br />The new 12-page booklet has very knowledgeable and affectionate liner notes by ROB BOWMAN - the LP's artwork on the front and rear of the booklet (including Bob Altshuler's original 1962 LP liner notes) - session details, Stax Records release info and reissue credits. But once again the big news is the NEWLY REMASTERED SOUND...<br /><br />I've reviewed all the other titles in the \\"Stax Remasters\\" series (see list below) and duly raved about the fabulous sound quality on them - especially after years of lacklustre reissues in jewel cases and repro digipaks. Well this is the same. 24-bit remastered from the first generation tapes at JOE TARANTINO Mastering in Berkeley, California - the audio quality is meaty - especially of course on the slinky organ of Booker T Jones and the guitar-chopping of Steve Cropper.<br /><br />Named after a vegetable that plagued American gardens in the summertime and played by a group named after a British Sports car - the 7\\" single \\"Green Onions\\" was a bona-fide monster. Originally issued in the USA on Volt 101 - it was quickly withdrawn and reissued on Stax 127 with the languid \\"Behave Yourself\\" as its classy B-side. It hit the US charts in August 1962 and made Number 1 R&B and Number 3 Pop. But not only is \\"Green Onions\\" absolute classic 60t's Soul - it has to rank as one the greatest instrumentals ever issued - its cool still intact a full 50 years after it blew everyone away and brought dancefloors to life all over the world.<br /><br />I wish I could say the rest of the album lives up to that high - it doesn't. The covers of The Beatles \\"Twist And Shout\\", Acker Bilk's \\"Stranger On A Shore\\" and Ray Charles' \\"Lonely Avenue\\" are not great - but things pick up considerably with their plucky version of Phil Upchurch's \\"Can't Sit Down\\" with fantastic sound quality on Cropper's guitar and Al Jackson's drums. The same applies to their cover of Jackie Wilson's \\"A Woman, A Lover, A Friend\\" - with Duck Dunn's bass having a warm sound. The identikit \\"Mo' Onions\\" was issued as a 45 in 1963 on Stax 142 and has been a fan favourite ever since (and a big moment in their live shows). It sounds fantastic here. The only real plonkers for me are the two live versions, which hardly warrant the word 'bonus' in my book.<br /><br />Speaking of 'disappointment' - for fans this is a very good release - better sound and better presentation (even if the supposed extras are dogs). But it has to be said that since the initial flurry of \\"Stax Remasters\\" in 2011 which promised a new coming for this fabulous Soul/Funk label (see list below) - 2012 has seen only 2 reissues - Albert King and this? And iconic or not - \\"Green Onions\\" is a rather obvious, safe and boring reissue.<br /><br />To sum up - despite those naff live additions - you do get better sound than that Rhino reissue nearly 20 years ago - improved packaging and a value-for-money pricetag. Recommended...<br /><br />And please Concord Music? Let's have some Carla Thomas, Eddie Floyd, Soul Children, The Emotions, William Bell, Little Milton, Margie Joseph, Isaac Hayes, Judy Clay, Delaney & Bonnie Bramlett and more of The Staples Singers too...<br /><br />PS: titles in the \\"STAX REMASTERS\\" series are (all reviewed):<br />1. Green Onions - BOOKER T. & THE M.G.S (1962)<br />2. McLemore Avenue - BOOKER T. & THE M.G.S (1970)<br />3. Woman To Woman- SHIRLEY BROWN (1975)<br />4.

B0013FBS20|4.0|I very rarely get scared watching a film, and while I'm not claiming that this movie was terrifying, it definitely made the hair on my arms stand on end. Out of all the horror films I've watched, this is one that delivers. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Not so creepy, but delightfully intense.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|Was exactly as expected.  Very cute and gave my brother and I a good laugh when we were reminiscing about the Gremlins movie.  I bought one for him and one for my 4 year old daughter.  Both thought it was fun.  Definitely more of a novelty toy than a play toy.  We played with it for a bit, but now it's on a shelf for the novelty side.  Shipping was incredibly quick and I have zero complaints about the order or product.
B00275EGX8|5.0|I'm pretty shocked that more people didn't love this film. Maybe it's because my husband is active duty and I feel a bond of sorts with characters like these, but I thought the film was really well done. And I don't like ALL military movies. In fact, I tend to dislike them; they're generally done so poorly. This, on the other hand, was well made, had a cast of great actors, and kept me on edge. I thought it humanized things more than your average Hollywood blockbuster that casts the military in an exaggerated, ridiculous light at times.

B0034G4P9E|5.0|While I'm a bit of a tom-boy and cannot stand romance, I also cannot stand exaggerated, over the top, big Hollywood actions films. This movie, on the other hand, was really well done and has a great story line. I also very rarely cry at the end of a movie, but I was a blubbering mess at the end of 'Warrior.' Just a very good film with a touching story.

6305428042|1.0|This movie is terrible. There's really no other way to say it. I tried to watch it with my children, and trust me, I'm a Halloween hound. I love all things Halloween, but this movie was a big, fat stinker. Absolutely terrible, awful special effects (if you want to call them that), bad plot, less than mediocre acting. Just bad, bad, bad!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good way to waste time and its fun for every one even little kids can play to and there even games for older people
B000M5AJQI|5.0|There's really not much to say other than: THIS IS THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE! Okay-okay, maybe it's not the best movie ever made, as it definitely has some heavy contenders, but it's one of the best films...ever. Acting was great, characters were great, they captured Boston really well, and hey...it's one of the best movies ever.

B0034G4ORC|4.0|I was very reluctant to watch this movie. I expected it to be your average over-the-top Hollywood blockbuster, with poor acting and stupid story-lining. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the acting wasn't terribly, the story-line was good. Unrealistic-but good. All in all, I thought it was actually a good movie.
0307951529|4.0|I enjoyed the stories in this book and Chris's approach to encouraging people who dream of having their own business to go ahead and make the leap. I also respect and admire Chris's philosophy of giving back and helping people whether through charity or when starting up a business.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />Sometimes the message seemed redundant and over referencing case studies again and again with little change in focus. Some of the instances of success were hard to related to, but overall the book made the seemingly impossible seem doable.<br /><br />I do recommend the book as a helpful look-see into a number of case studies of small business success, but for firm details on how these types of enterprises started or continue to run a follow up is needed.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This group has been one of my favorites for a while now, since I heard Radioactive on the previous EP of theirs. The new album is every bit as good as I had hoped. Their style includes folksy songs and more post-modern ones using a lot of synthesized backgrounds. It's a style I've never heard anywhere else, and \\"Bleeding Out\\" is currently my favorite song. In a phrase, I think this group is best described as epic postmodern folk. Give them a listen; their style is fresh, with lyrics both original and evocative. One of the best albums I've ever heard. It deserves its (so far) fully five-star rating.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I received this as a gift and I LOVE it. I never would have been aware of this artist. But this CD has been one of the 6 that my CD player in the car will hold for over a year. I'll add that I'm 44 and officially out of the loop of popular music. I played this for a boyfriend, who is over 50, and he borrowed it and never gave it back. I had to buy another copy. Enjoy the thoughtful, interesting lyrics with melodies ranging from spacey/dreamy calm to super fast with contagious energy.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|Yes I know this mouse is not a Razer or Logitech,but I'll tell you one thing in the 6 -7 months I've owned this mouse is all I could tell you is this mouse lives up to its reputation.I have played different types of games including first persons and this mouse delivers every step of the way in games such as:Dead Space 1 and 2,Bioshock 1 and 2,singularity,Deus Ex Human Revolution,Fallout 3 and New Vegas,Mass Effect 2 and many more.So don't just talk smack about the Cooler Master Storm Inferno mouse just do yourself the favor a go and get this mouse it's really worth every penny and not to mention its has multiple settings for DPI, lights up really cool with Cooler Master logo ,really long USB wire and many more features comes with Cooler Master Inferno mouse,box,and software disk.(Note:It would be really cool if this mouse had a mini fan inside for cooling it since Cooler Master is known for making cooling products or even better a small motor that Rumbles when gaming, like an Xbox 360 controller so that you could really get the feel of the game,but that might make it hard to work with.) Anyway whatever just buy this mouse.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Really enjoyed reading Me before You, the characters in the book drew me in and the story line kept the interest up throughout.

0062197258|5.0|Cathy Bailey is a single professional woman living in London.  But she is far from a happy-go-lucky woman.  Instead, she is a former victim of domestic violence who is trying to put her life back together.  The victim of a horrendous attack that sent her to the hospital and then to the psychiatric ward as she tried to deal with what happened, she is now desperately trying to put her life back together.<br /><br />Cathy's attacker was sent to jail, but for only three years.  That three years is now up and Cathy is sure that he is coming back to look for her.  Didn't he always say that she was his no matter what?  Didn't he say that he couldn't live without her and that no one else would have her if he couldn't?<br /><br />Cathy is trying to get stronger, but she is petrified by her fears.  She spends hours checking doors and windows, refusing to go out except to work. She trusts no one.  She has panic attacks that cripple her for hours.  She dresses in frumpy clothes that she hopes disguises her body and makes her unnoticable in a crowd.<br /><br />Things start to change when the upstairs flat in her building is rented to a doctor, Stuart.  Stuart and Cathy become friends, and with his encouragement, Cathy starts to deal with her OCD and PTSD.  Then, it all starts again.  Little things are different in her apartment.  She thinks she sees her attacker several times.  Is he coming back for her or is she just imagining the danger?<br /><br />Into The Darkest Corner is Elizabeth Haynes debut novel.  It was Amazon UK's Best Book Of The Year.  Haynes is a police intelligence analyst, and her work allows her to chart the progression of this terror with heart stopping details.  The book is compelling and almost impossible to put down; the reader needs to determine what will happen to Cathy.  This book is recommended for thriller readers.

B000AP2ZDK|5.0|Once you get over the initial \\"disappointment\\" that this CD, supposedly an \\"instrumental\\" CD, is LOADED with vocals...upon repeated listenings it becomes a truly stellar work of art, a collage/soundscape that is loads of fun, with real feeling...an excellent CD to play at a party, or when you want to lively up yourself.  Normally, I expect \\"instrumental\\" CDs to be relatively vocal-free, and while Donuts is certainly NOT vocal-free, I have learned to absolutely LOVE IT.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|I can't decide if this book wants to be an autobiography or a tell-all of the NY<br />and P-town restaurant business.  It can be very amusing and Mr. B is a creative writer who has makes his colorful cast of characters come to life.  Parts of the book are vulgar so if you have a sensitivity to crude and boorish behavior you might want to find something else to read.
0071373586|5.0|Interesting book. It helps you to understand about a great number of brands that are out there and why they are successful or not. It's easy to read it.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I loved the books, so I was a bit apprehensive about how a movie version would fare.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the casting turned out.<br /><br />I had not heard of Jennifer Lawrence nor seen any of her work before she was cast into this movie.  I think that she made a great Katniss Everdeen.  She really embraced the role of a girl who had the weight of the world on her shoulders.  I love LOVE Stanley Tucci as an actor and he was perfect in his role as well.  I usually cannot stand Woody Harrelson, but he didn't bother me at all in this movie.  I think his Haymitch might turn out quite well.  And as much as I loathe Donald Sutherland, he made a perfect President Snow.<br /><br />I do think that if you haven't read the book, the story may be a bit hard to follow, as they do have to skip through some sections of the book in order to keep the movie at a reasonable length.  You miss a lot of the interaction between Katniss and Peeta. But I think that they did the best they could within the time limitations.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

0897502027|5.0|What Bruce Lee has covered here encompasses both his philosophy and his art.  I love how he was able to discuss how philosophy (in general) and the martial arts blend together.  The mindset of a warrior is imperative in success and he brings that aspect to his art.  Even though he wrote this at such a young age, his work is for all ages.<br /><br />Important in every art is the focus on the basics and that what he was able to accomplish here.  Though, the use of photographs may have worked better, the sketches do their job in illustrating the movements.  Especially on the foundational work.  Since Bruce Lee's philosophy, in part, is to keep it simple - that is what Tao of Jeet Kune Do does.  That includes the sections on tools and attack.<br /><br />I would suggest that practitioner of any fighting art get this book and apply it into their own life.

B007N5YJWK|4.0|Although film master Alfred Hitchcock went on to make better films, this must be considered one of his earliest triumphs.  It also seems to have set the stage for introducing many Hitchcock contrivances to be used in later films.  In this espionage thriller leading up to WW II, a Canadian businessman (English heartthrob Robert Donat) visiting a London theater is set upon by a woman who requests his help.  She suggests going to his apartment which may have also suggested some hanky-panky.  Alas not.<br /><br />It turns out she is an agent of some kind that has linked a man in Scotland with the plans to steal some defense secret.  She is being hunted by confederates of the man.  Asleep in different rooms, the agents manage to put a knife into her back.  Lucie Mannheim plays her death scene for all its worth, but not before giving Hannay (Donat) a map that leads to the connection in Scotland.<br /><br />Of course Hannay is now on the run from the nefarious agents (no explanation as to why they didn't off him at the same time) and the police who suspect he killed Ms. Smith (Mannheim).  Escaping via train, he is found but manages to get away again, but not before a brief and unintentional meeting with Pamela (Brit Madeleine Carroll with a Scottish accent).  Ms. Carroll will become the first in a long line of blond heroines in Hitchcock films.  Pamela and Hannay will eventually reunite but for most of the film she believes he is guilty.  That doesn't stop some wonderful comedic byplay between the two, another Hitchcock trademark.<br /><br />There is a memorable scene midway through the film after Hannay escapes the police on the train.  In what appears to be a walk of dozens if not hundreds of miles he comes upon a farm house just short of his destination.  Tired and hungry he asks the crofter for shelter.  He agrees but insists on being paid.  In a brief but haunting sequence, Peggy Ashcroft as the crofter's wife displays the loneliness of her existence in the rural highlands and begs for information of civilization.  An amazing performance.  As the police zero in, Margaret (Ashcroft) helps Hannay escape knowing her husband will alert the police hearing of a reward.<br /><br />After Hannay finds his way to the house of the spymaster, he is shot but survives thanks to a convenient bible Margaret left in his breast pocket.  Finding himself once again in the control of the local police an unlikely chain of events leads Hannay to be taken away by the bad guys, but they also decide to take Pamela as a witness.  Uh huh.  They get away but this time they are handcuffed together.  Their continued jousting is consistent with Hitchcock's use of levity, especially when the innocent man is involved.  The couple ends up at an inn where there is a room with only one bed.  This becomes problematic in a world of 1935 and is eventually resolved but not before Hitch manages to insert a scene where Pamela must remove her wet stockings as she remains linked to Hannay.  Very sexy.  Hitchcock was a master at swerving around the various censor boards in England and The United States.<br /><br />In addition to adapting a compelling story based on John Buchan's 1915 novel, Hitchcock continued his technical film mastery.  There are numerous examples of his groundbreaking use of camera angles, shots in crowds, distant figures in silhouette against a setting sun and so forth.  This is one entertaining film that uses themes Hitchcock never forgot.<br /><br />The Criterion package includes a 1080p resolution with the squarish 1.33:1 aspect ratio that was originally used.  The picture quality, while certainly acceptable and watchable, does show some fading and other problems.  The age of the original and the transferring master suggests this might be as good as can be.  The audio is a mono Dolby Digital 1.0 and sounds fine.  The dialog is clear and distinct.  The extras are plentiful and are noted by Amazon above so I won't go into detail.  They include a coupleHitchcock interviews, a radio production, a documentary and a booklet that includes an informative essay about Hitchcock and the film.Hitchcock interviews, a radio production, a documentary and a booklet that includes an informative essay about Hitchcock and the film.

B00812W8AE|5.0|Feelings are like a shadow. We try to hide in front of them. The penalty of modern external life is having your medulla massaged a hundred different ways at the same time, while it sleeps in a primal readiness that lets the flesh wander about in smoke and sugar. Perfection is the head but destruction is the tale.... We forget that we live in an ocean. We remember to panic once a month... paying our debts in the same rhythm of the moon and ovulation cycles. Is our tragedy having children grow up and move away or is it the only thing left that gives us meaning? Is Mad Men's lesson to find the grace in loneliness? May all your elevator shafts  be filled with Cool Whip.

B008LZAVIC|4.0|This is a Christmas gift for my 8 year old daughter.  She is loving Legos all the sudden.  Finally - Legos got smart and has developed this line specifically for girls - I hope they continue and we see more and more.  Honestly, this set has not been opened yet - so I can only gauge the quality based on the several other sets we've purchased - overall very happy.  But the price here is a rip off, and I picked this item up at Toys R Us for $109.  I purchased it online and had it shipped for free to the closest store for pickup.  Very convenient - and a much better price.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I really love this series.  The behind the scenes documentaries only make me like it more. It's a weird sci-fi western mix which doesn't sound very good but if you give it a chance I think you will like it also.  It's easy to relate to all of the characters and I love the way the future is represented in the series.

B007L3BMGA|2.0|Its Wuthering Heights (think Heathcliff) meets Pretty Woman (think Richard Gere) at a Eyes Wide Shut party.  Popular sentiment is that the book is Mummy Porn - a big hit with the over 30s demographic.  Speaking as a member of this demographic, it falls short of the intensity found in Wuthering Heights, lacks the spunky swept off your feet feeling of Pretty Woman and doesn't have the voyeurism of Eyes Wide Shut.  There's a difference between being worshiped by a brooding romantic lead and being completed dominated like a child who is prevented from making the day to day choices such as what to wear, where to work, what to eat etc.  The characters have a lack of depth and failed to draw me in.  I also failed to find the story erotic but frankly a bit crude with no finesse. I expected a lot more because of all the hype but was disappointed on all levels.

B004AFFZNI|5.0|I at first purchased this because when I used my GoPro for Racing it seemed that the sounds were too muffled, and the camera was getting extremely hot (even when indoors). I tried using this and there was WAYY too much wind noise.  Nothing against the housing, just too much wind noise for my application. I later realized that I had inserted my anti-moisture tabs into the original skeleton housing and that was why it was so muffled. The camera was cooler with the skeleton housing however.<br /><br />Because GoPro doesn't offer a lens cap, this ended up doubling as a protective case when not on the road.  It allows me to charge and everything without running the risk of damaging the camera's lense.  The workmanship is identical to the original, so I have no issues with the quality.<br /><br />As far as my needs, it became a ~$25 lens cap for me.  But don't let my use of it deter you. It does exactly what its designed to do.

Amazon's service was great as always and I can't complain at all about Amazon - strictly a product review. I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone.

This is book is a brilliant tale of modern warfare.  Kyle is not only the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history, he is also also a husband, a son, a father, and a friend to many.  The book does a great job of explaining and expanding on these relationships.  Being a fan of military history, I loved the battle descriptions, but I also loved the exerts where his wife shared what she was feeling while Chris was away in Iraq.

Sure, I liked many of the tunes, but I think overexposure in the 80s might have had something to do with it.<br />When I came across this collection, my feelings for ZZ Top had grown into an appreciation. This band has been going strong for over 40 years now, and have the tunes to show it.  I've been listening non-top for a few days now and the remastering is fantastic, and the selection covers just about every song you'd want.<br />All in all, a lot of great music for your money.  Definitely worth it.

B0053O89KG|2.0|My wife and I were into Castle from Season 1, Episode 1. And that's mostly because we're fans of Nathan Fillion. In our eyes, the man can do no wrong.<br /><br />Castle was an instant hit with us. The chemistry between all the characters was amazing. And we hadn't seen magic between two characters like we did with Castle and Beckett ever. She was hot. He was witty. Castle was our favorite show on TV.<br /><br />Then came Season Four and it all went to the dumpster.<br /><br />I can't even begin to explain all of the things wrong with Season Four. It was a train wreck from the very first episode -- a massive let down that set the stage for everything else to follow.<br /><br />Everything we loved about Castle from Seasons 1-3 is missing in Season Four. A partial list:<br /><br />1. Beckett's not the same person. Instead of being flirtatious and hot, she dressed like a dowdy librarian, was withdrawn and cranky, and rarely paired with Castle on cases. Stana Katic is, easily, one of the hottest women on TV. But her looks and personality were hidden throughout Season Four. Beckett wasn't Beckett in Season Four.<br /><br />2. Castle was morose, tense, and ill at ease in Season Four. He rarely wrote, talked about writing, had fun with Beckett, or even was particularly playful with his daughter and mother. Castle wasn't Castle in Season Four.<br /><br />3. The special writers pokers games with Castle and other giants of the literary world were absent. Not a single game took place. The writers weren't the writers in Season Four.<br /><br />4. The camaraderie between Castle, Beckett, Ryan and Esposito is absent in Season Four. The first three seasons were hilarious, especially in seasons between Ryan and Esposito. Don't look for the fun in Season Four. It's not there. Ryan and Esposito were not Ryan and Esposito in Season Four.<br /><br />5. The new precinct captain is a tool. She's angry, terse, and brutal. Thankfully, her role was minimal. She was barely there. And, when she was, she wasn't likeable. We definitely missed Captain Roy Montgomery. So the precinct captain wasn't the precinct captain in Season Four.<br /><br />6. The near misses between Castle and Beckett reached new heights of aggravation. The writers/producers built up a tremendous relationship between them over the first three years. After the cliff hanger of Season Three, everyone had high hopes for the start of Season Four. Tragically, the potential relationship died at the end of Season Three. It was over and done within the first 15 minutes of Season Four. After the first episode, everything fell to crap and Beckett and Castle were estranged from the first episode onward. Every time they nearly spoke honestly to one another, they were interrupted by Ryan or Esposito or a phone call or something. Over and over again. It got so bad -- and so frequent -- that we felt manipulated. We knew we were being conned, strung along, by the writers. So many times we said to ourselves, \\"This is it. We're done.\\" So the romance wasn't the romance in Season Four.<br /><br />7. The writers introduced a character -- Michael Dorn -- as a counselor/psychologist, a person in whom Beckett could confide. Dorn's character was a way for the writers to trip over themselves with exposition, occasionally letting the audience in on secrets in Beckett's life. However, this character was never fully realized. He appeared only, maybe three times in Season Four. Dorn was wasted. So important characters were not important characters in Season Four.<br /><br />8. The first three seasons felt like the writers treated the audience with respect (with the exception of increasingly implausible near misses between Castle and Beckett). We didn't feel used, cheated, or talked down to. Season Four was exactly the opposite. We felt like we did when we watched the last few episodes of the TV show LOST, especially the series finale. The last episode of LOST surely qualifies as one of the worst in TV history. The writers got lazy and didn't give a rat's keister about the audience. That's how Season Four of Castle felt. The writers squandered characters we grew to love. They wasted the talents of gifted actors. And they wasted our time as members of the audience. So the writing was not the writing in Season Four.<br /><br />9. The stories lacked snap. The cases these character investigated were B-grade compared to the first three seasons. They just weren't interesting, compelling, or worth staying up to watch. So the stories weren't the stories in Season Four.<br /><br />10. The season finale didn't make up for an entire season of garbage that came before it. It was too little, too late. And absolutely unrealistic. It was phoney. It should have been the first episode of Season Four, not the last. (Plus, the writers lost our trust with the abysmal Season Four opener. We expected big things in Season Four, at least a relationship between Castle and Beckett. So we don't have high hopes for Season Five. We've been burned before.<br /><br />Season Four of Castle was one of the biggest letdowns we've ever experienced in a TV show. It was sloppy and contrived and unrealistic and a sad waste of time.<br /><br />We may buy Season Four when it's released on DVD. But we probably won't. None of the episodes are worth watching again. They were painful enough the first time.<br /><br />Season Five has 2-3 episodes to redeem itself, to make amends for the sins of Season Four. After that, we're tuning out and spending our time elsewhere. So we hope the writers found their mojo again -- or put some effort into their writing. Castle is too good to screw up.

1451627297|5.0|I am not a fan of horror novels and have never read a Stephen King book before.  My husband loved the book and recommended it to me and I'm glad I listened (this time  ;-).  He builds up a very believable picture of the time period and what it might be like to be transported back there from the 21st century.  It got a little far out there at the end....but hey, the whole premise is far out so I'll give him that point.  You might have to be at least 40 to appreciate this - but if you are, I think you'll like it.
0375836675|5.0|I adored this book because it is a lot of things: weird, crazy, different from everything I've ever read in my life, and laughing-out-loud-seriously-I-can't-breathe hilarious.<br />The hero -Ed- is one of the most lovely characters I've ever encountered in books, and he really deserves being known by everybody. Go read this book, people! :)
1475143389|5.0|This book was very straightforward and cut through the fat regarding the proper way to diet and exercise. Mr. Matthews approach is constructive, supportive and most of all caring. He cares not to stick you with a bunch of fitness myths that limits the readers chances of making progress and cares about the potential that you do have to succeed. This worked for me and can certainly work for anyone as well.
0545140323|4.0|Heartbroken Penny Lane and her girls form a club and vow never to date a guy from their high school again, since not a single one of them is worth it - and would most certainly break their hearts in no time- but the club quickly becomes so much more than just an anti-male thing, and soon these girls start to bond, have fun, and really learn to have a life.<br />Previously this year I read \\"Prom and Prejudice\\" by this same author, loved it, and as so decided to get my hands on this one too (her first book, actually), and it did not disappoint me - it was a delightful reading, albeit for a younger audience, but still entertaining for readers of every age. I loved seeing the girls stand up for themselves and learning important values in the process - if only every women on the planet followed their example! (You can do it girls!) And of course, it was lovely to watch Penny's broken heart heal when she was least expecting it to happen, and with the help of the most unlikely person. *wink*<br />This is a light reading, recommended to those who wish someone would have started something like The Lonely Hearts Club when they were in high school. ;)

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just absolutely love this game. it gave me plenty of options and the games have some challenge to them. way to go and keep it up.
B001BC5HXG|4.0|Isn't it interesting when you reread a book after forty-some years, for now I believe I understand why Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden\\" is indeed a classic.  The book is about life, human nature and making decisions.  It is the story of everyman and it is a great read, you will not be disappointed. MK
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Sounds silly but this game is crazy how fun AND addictive this game is. I really enjoy it!!!  :) you should get this game! Its free so why no?!  Its very entertaining and with multiple types of ways to play its surprising how much tome you can spend passing the time with it!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'd been looking for an app that was user friendly and could help me learn to approach arukone puzzles.  Don't know why it took so long to find this one but it' well developed.  I love the set up - you can learn quickly with progressively difficult puzzles and the time trial option is fun, addictive and pushes you to master strategies.  I just hope I don't run through the puzzles offered too quickly!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this game/app for my kindle and would recommend it to anyone who has a kindle. Thank you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its pretty awesome test it out you'll see it for yourself it allows you to express yourself through art words pictures and etc even videos its also allows you to follow people you may know from facebook and twitter or you can follow some very creative strangers your choice :) enjoy
B004GYY714|4.0|I now own the Pro version, which adds the ability to record.  Good app which allows one to choose favorite stations and even favorite songs. It also provides decent recommendations for similar radio stations.  This has been the most used app on all my tablets.CONS:  A bit difficult to find Podcasts, but they can be found using the search feature.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I don't know what I expected but this was a way cool movie. It went beyond the normal legend and myth and really explored the characters personalities and motivations. I loved the way the story came to life but more than that I loved the story behind the myth.<br /><br />Thor rocked.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|I am brand spankin new to the world of high end audio. I decided a few months ago that I wanted to get a pair of decent headphones for my birthday so I googled Beats by Dre and found out they were overpriced, overhyped, overbassed, trash smashers as deemed by audiophiles. So I did some research, found a pair I thought would perfectly suit my needs (Sennheiser HD598) and decided to go for broke and also get an AMP/DAC. I found that FiiO makes a very sleek, very affordable, and well rounded device. The E17 had just come out so why not go for it? I'm very glad I did because the level of detail is definitely increased, and the bass punches nice and crisp. I use my headphones for mostly classic and new rock, underground hip-hop, and some electronic. With the FiiO E17 everything shines that much brighter. I also love using this to amp-up speakers. You can run an aux cord from a crappy little ipod speaker set-up to the headphone head out port of the E17. Run another aux cord from the aux-in port on the E17, to the aux-out port on your source (Ipod cd player), turn the volume up to 90-95% on your source and control the volume on your E17. It will sound beautiful. USE HIGH QUALITY LOSSLESS FLAC, WAV FILES or CDs or else it will sound like crap. MP3 is a simplified version of the song. It is missing instruments and sounds that you will hear when you download or buy CDs and upload into quality FLAC files. If you have an Ipod or Iphone download the app FLAC Player to play your FLAC files. Love my E17.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this is really a cool book.  The subject matter is extremely interesting and the research seems to be right on target.  If you haven't already, add this to your \\"to read\\" list today!  So what is so powerful about it?  Basically, it shows how patterns and habits within a person or group of people can affect their entire life.  After reading this book, I saw how almost everything in my life was either a habit or done because of a habit.  After the author shows how hugely habits affect lives, he gives practical advice on how to make changes to those habits to get the results you want in your personal, career, or physical life.  I have personally made a goal to begin changing my life and taking more control of it after reading [[ASIN:B006PX2W2K Time Control - Taking Control and Achieving Goals (Creating Lifestyle)]].  This book has helped me to see why I do some of the things that I do and how to start changing them, one habit at a time.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Fun puzzle game. I lose track of time working these and love the Color. Developer needs to look @ #2.11 light blue @ top. Seems to be a numbering error on the version that was faotd recrently. But other than that so far it is great FUN!

B002ZG981E|2.0|Lets get the good points over with 1st: Good acting,creative, good score<br /><br />I am very fussy with action movies today. After seeing this film, I am very much in a hurry to see 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' in the theaters. Why, because I am afraid I will never see an ordinary, traditional, digestible action film on the big screen anymore! I am afraid that 'The Matrix' started this mess! The batmobile/cycle chase in Dark Knight (same Director) is a good action sequence that you can find in a new film nowadays. But 'Inception' is just a mess! \\"Oh No! The subconscience people are attacking!!\\"<br /><br />It's just thrown at your face too fast and too close to digest or appreciate it!! Why cant I understand it while its happening instead of finding out later?? Do I have to watch it again or go on Wicipedia to find out the plot that I cant swallow but keep spitting out? Well, I dont know If I want to see it again...too bad I bought it!! A few iconic tweaks may have helped this tremendously: Like a different music theme for a different dream layer. The editing and layout of the movie just didnt work!...I guess I'm old fashioned!<br />The story is a problem with this movie! Maybe the story looks better on the page! There was something really wrong with the translation of the material to the screen. Years ago this would have been unacceptable. But I guess people were saying things like me here when seeing Hitchcock's Vertigo in 1958.

B005UBNKZG|5.0|The 8120 is a great CPU and not just because its cheaper then intel! I don't really any cons about the 8120 at all. On the stock cooler it runs somewhat cool. On my rig it runs about 40c to 43c on idol, under gaming(Crysis 2, Guild Wars 2 and a couple other demanding games) it runs about 47c to 54c now that's on the stock cooler . This CPU is also super easy to overclock (if you want to not my thing). Also it will overclock itself to 4.1Ghz if it thinks the load is a bit much for the current clock. I think it starts at like 3.1Ghz. For those who care about packaging it comes in a tin that you can reuse keeping in mind that there is a hole the size of the CPU on the lift side if the tin. I have had the 8120 for a little over a month now and the only thing I can say is its a a great CPU for every thing from gaming to just surfing the web. I would say if I had to pick one thing that is bad it would have to be the stock cooler, Want to talk about loud! This cooler will some times just get ubber loud for how small it is. I would say get aftermarket or water.
B000055ZB8|5.0|Great movie.  It is very creepy.  The fact that it is silent and black and white makes it creepier.  Max Schreck is a hideous Count Orlok.
B0094ZJ7HO|4.0|I thought The Seldom Seen Kid was a pretty album, and I was curious when I heard about Dead in the Boot.  This is an interesting collection of songs (B sides and non-album tracks) that have a very ethereal feel to them.  This comes across the strongest on \\"None One\\" with its somber piano and eerie synth and vocals.  The same verse is merely repeated twice \\"Hey there/Tell me/Does he/Kiss your eyes?/Do you talk/Like I've died now?\\".  I guess you could say the lyrics are on the opaque side.  That is true on a few other songs that are sparse in that department - \\"Lullaby\\", \\"Lay Down Your Cross\\", \\"Waving From Windows\\", and \\"Every Bit The Little Girl\\" among them.<br /><br />This album can give you musical whiplash the way some of the songs are ordered.  The most ferocious song \\"McGreggor\\" is between the gentle numbers \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Buffalo Ghosts\\".  I say that rather tongue in cheek, though.  It gives the album variety.  Other variations include the vocal delivery.  On \\"Gentle As\\" it is very straight ahead while \\"Love Blown Down\\" is distorted.  \\"Lullaby\\" features rich harmonies.<br /><br />In the end, Dead in the Boot is a collection of mostly mellow mood music.  While they are B sides, they fit together pretty well.  I think you should give it try if you like their other stuff.<br /><br />Download this:  Lullaby

0670022705|2.0|My interest was piqued after a brief visit to the British Museum a few months ago. This book provides 100 brief but highly informative discussions of objects in this collection. Some are mere fragments, others are complete; some are well known (literally iconic), others obscure.<br /><br />Each essay sets the object's context, explains its significance, and tells a story about the people who made and used it. These pieces are short, finely crafted, and fascinating. The style is clear and succinct in a uniquely British way. Despite the range of tens of thousands of years, the overall effect is one of continuity.<br /><br />However, the author never misses an opportunity to bemoan the supposed ills of western civilization, take cheap shots at the USA, and trot out at least one politically correct hobbyhorse. Do you think the use of the atomic bomb in WWII is morally equivalent to the Nazi Holocaust, Stalin's Gulag, and Pol Pot's killing fields? Do you think that a personal solar cell is as significant for the 21st century as the Rosetta Stone was c. 200 BC? Just like the artifacts it catalogs, this book reflects a narrow slice of its zeitgeist --the post-modern hair shirt of the faculty lounge.<br /><br />After a steady stream of these assaults, I was tempted to feed the book into a shredder. However, except for the last section (20th century to the present), the intrinsic interest of the artifacts and the masterful story telling is not diminished by this condescending, gratuitous, and predictable drivel.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app aids problem solving and visual-spacial skills. also lots of fun...my kids and I challenge each other on a regular basis.

0525952616|4.0|Having read the other reviews, I was happy to get the only copy at the library and just<br />finished it. Wow, a terrific story line and plot with well defined characters and enough science<br />that you 'get it' pretty quick. The robot swarms are smart enough to tear anything apart<br />and shoot zip guns at humans makes for a scary humans vs. the machines confrontation, and<br />with the military industrial complex behind the whole conspiracy, it is enough to make you<br />feel pretty paranoid by the end....which is a heart stopper batttle! I have read the two prior Suarez's novels<br />and this new one is just a convincing as the others, and I hope we see these characters again.<br />After all, the bad guys have been defeated in the initial plot, but they are only slowed down...not stopped.<br />Don't miss reading this novel as it is much more than just a beach side read during a summer<br />vacation. It presents a very real threat that could easily occur given our technology culture.

B007VYQ6DS|1.0|I waited so long to receive this documentary, expecting something on par with the great animal documentaries shown on PBS.  Not!  I can't tell you how disappointed I was by this Disneynature Chimpanzee film.  The narration by Tim Allen was dull and slow. His comments were stiff and overly-orchestrated.  Not in sync with what we were seeing.  The comments lacked substance and did not complement the scenes.  As to the scenes: the majority of the shots taken of the Chimps were veiled by the trees and shadows of the forest.  There were no sustained closeups of the Chimps' activities and daily lives. The camera seemed to jump around a lot. I would not recommend this film for purchase.
1476712042|4.0|Okay. I have a lot to say about this book and I felt like after I read this book, I was letting so many other blogger's opinions of the novel get to me so I decided to close Goodreads and just write my damn review. I've always prided myself on giving honest and truthful reviews no matter what other people say/think. This book garnered A LOT of controversy and flack and I can see why but I will also sit here and defend my opinion of this novel because you know what? I freaking loved it. I loved this book.<br /><br />First of all, this book reminded me of the show Intervention or Hoarders...the people on those shows are complete and utter train wrecks. Hot messes. Totally unable to understand why they do what they do. But I still watch it. Each and every time. I even ENJOY and look forward to watching these train wrecks. Why? I don't know. I just do. I'm guessing I'm not the only one either, otherwise the shows would be off the air. Anyways, Beautiful Disaster is kind of like those shows. Abby and Travis are train wrecks themselves. They have unhealthy personality traits and an unhealthy relationship. But the thing is...I've been there. I've seen it. And I've also seen it work out for the better like it does in this book. In my opinion, a lot of  the \\"reasons\\" people didn't like this book so much has me scratching my head. A lot of people call Travis abusive and I straight up disagree. I've seen firsthand what an abusive relationship is, and I do not feel that Travis is abusive to Abby in the least bit. Does he have some anger/obsessive personality traits? Yes. But he doesn't hit her, he doesn't call her a bitch or a skank or verbally abuse her. He just doesn't always communicate his feelings in the most appropriate ways... and you know what? Neither do I. Neither do a lot of people. It doesn't mean they are abusive people. The other thing that has me scratching my head is that people are getting SO UPSET over Travis and Abby's relationship when I can think of a hundred other books that make me cringe with the way they portray the relationship. 50 Shade of Grey? That is NOT a healthy relationship but instead of beating it to a pulp, people are eating it up! Twilight...ugh... don't even get me started. I'd much rather have a protagonist like Abby, who is smart, witty and stands up for herself than a character like Bella Swan. But the thing people are also forgetting is that in this book, Travis and Abby's relationship DOESN'T work until they figure out who they are separately and how to fix what's broken in them. When they are able to face their own demons, the become the very best of themselves and then the relationship is able to prosper. Which I think is a beautiful, beautiful thing. Everyone always says pessimistically, \\"people never change,\\" but I disagree. Sometimes, when it's with the right person and for the right reasons, people can and will change.<br /><br />Okay, now that I got that part out of the way, the other reasons why I love this book.... I thought that ALL characters were fabulous and I thought they all broke down the stereotype that I initially thought they'd all be in. Abby is a \\"good\\" girl, smart, driven and yet... she has a troubled past, she's a smart ass and even she is not without temptation to the badass hotties. Travis is the tattooed fighter that has an enormous ego...yet he's smart and affectionate and has a vulnerability that is adorable. America...oh, America. She is the best friend every person should have. Loyal to a fault, protective and yet just brave enough to encourage her friend to do some stupid things. But it's in the little details that make me love America. A couple of her off-hand comments that make me feel like she and Abby have an incredibly close friendship. I even like Shepley, who reminds me so much of one of my friends. I liked the premise of the novel, though I found that to be secondary to my attachment to the characters. Was it a little unrealistic? Yeah. Did I care? Nope. I've been reading for so long that I'm the type of reader that is able to suspend belief, even in a contemporary novel, if A. I like the characters and the plot enough and B. if it was written well enough. In my opinion, McGuire did both of these things, so the unrealistic parts didn't bother me. Actually, I kind of enjoyed it because I thought it put a twist on Abby's story and made her seem that much more interesting.<br /><br />One last thing. I know a lot of people were annoyed with Travis's pet name for Abby... but I loved it. I actually ADORED it. Maybe that's because in my relationship and close friendships with people, I have a rather unorthodox/silly/stupid nickname that seems ridiculous to the rest of the world but to those that are involved...it shows me how much I mean to them.<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing that REALLY bothered me in this entire story is that McGuire used a lot of unnecessary dialogue attributions and she said so and so \\"laughed once,\\" about a million times within the book and it annoyed the crap out of me. That was my only minor nitpick.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book. I read it in less than 8 hours and relished every moment with the cast. Obviously, just by seeing the Goodreads reviews, this book is not for everyone and honestly, I don't even know how to recommend it since so many different people seem to either love or hate it. So I guess my advice is... proceed with caution BUT don't ruin your judgement of the book by reading all the one or five star reviews. Find out for yourself. If I had followed some of my fellow bloggers instead of my own heart, I would have never picked up this book and that would have been a really sad thing.
B0088EDMMS|4.0|One of my favorite family films ever. I could not wait to get this on blu ray after having it on VHS, Laser Disc, and DVD.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the BEST this movie has looked or sounded since I saw it in the theater (3 times) when it came out. The colors are vibrant, and give the perfect fall/Halloween look and feel. The sound is superb, along with the clarity of the film.<br /><br />That being said, WHY does Disney insist on giving NO BONUS FEATURES on some of its most beloved live-action theatrical films when they come to blu ray, but they will load up the crud like the direct to video \\"Tinkerbell\\" stuff, or the never-ending \\"Air Buddy\\" sequels??? I know for a fact that there are trailers and \\"making-of\\" documentaries out there for \\"Hocus Pocus\\" because I used to have them on a VHS tape. I worked in a video store when the movie first came to VHS, and we got in a screener copy from Buena Vista which had a behind the scenes featurette (about 15 min long, if I remember correctly) and it had the trailer. Why can Disney not put these things on the blu ray?<br /><br />Anyway, 4 stars overall because the film is a favorite, and it DOES look and sound terrific. Just wish they'd put a little effort into some bonus content.

B006BAEQB2|4.0|The War of Roses, what a mess, what a bunch of power hungry backstabbing maniacs. What a time (I would sure not have liked to live then), and  in the end a time that is fascinating to read about.<br /><br />This book is about Anne Neville, daughter of the Warwick the Kingmaker. Anne who was married to the not so successful Lancaster Prince Edward and later to Richard of York. Always a pawn in the hands of men.<br /><br />I did like her at first, she has a brain, she thought about things, but the later part of the book started to change that. She was paranoid, she never used her head, she believed everything told to her, she never questioned things, she was always scared, she was a grey little mouse, a sour cow, and the b word too. I kind of lost respect for her there at the end. Always with the constant we hate the Rivers. She was cold. At least she felt like this to me. And she was naive too. But hey, then I always hated the Nevilles. Do not ask me why. But even if I disliked her at the end it sure did not take away the pleasure of reading a good novel.<br /><br />Richard I liked, he was portrayed as honorable (for the most part). Sure he had his hidden agendas but hey who has not.<br /><br />I can read a lot of books about the same time it seems, I never get tired. Because every time it is through the eyes of someone new, a new perspective. And here, oh it just shows what backstabbers everyone was, Warwick, the York boys. It was never enough for any of them, always more more more. Some issues for sure.<br /><br />A turbulent time viewed by a woman, not always at the center of things, but always behind the men who were.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A great tale from Gregory and I look forward to her next book which will be about Princess Elizabeth of York.
0525478817|2.0|The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green<br />(hardcover, 2012)<br /><br />What sort of perspective would an atheist typically bring to a discussion about dying, the possibilities of life after death, or about the (ir)relevance of sexual mores to someone who is dying? This book's tone is pretty representative. It does present a vivid window into the lives of modern teens (albeit atypical ones) dying of cancer, and it does fairly well at critiquing the unhelpful things people do or say (with perhaps too much focus on Christians--p.4-5, 16). Once I was able to accept the extremely precocious main characters, I found the book quite moving. (I agree with other reviewers that the peripheral characters were better and more believable but not very developed.) So in terms of catharsis, and witty dialogue, there is some value.<br /><br />But after its critiques, the book can do little to present a more helpful or uplifting perspective (although the reminder to \\"walk lightly upon the earth\\" is a good one):<br />- \\"And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you, I encourage you to ignore it. God knows everyone else does.\\" (p.13; cf. 312)<br />- \\"Cancer kids are essentially side effects of the relentless mutation that makes the diversity of life on earth possible.\\" (p.49)<br /><br />That tone will turn off many of the more spiritually-minded readers, as will the crass language. (Here are a few samples: 245 258 273 280) Also, vindictiveness is pretty much condoned: 229 277. And lots of sexuality: 19 94 207 etc.<br /><br />As literature, it is quite interesting, though a bit heavy-handed. Some of the metaphors (e.g. the grenade and scar metaphors) are quite good. Here are a few quotes, which may or may not be useful out of context. (Spoiler alert.)<br />- \\"pain demands to be felt\\" (57)<br />- \\"I'm a grenade and at some point I'm going to blow up and I would like to minimize the casualties, okay?\\" (99, cf. 59) \\"Only now that I loved a grenade did I understand the foolishnessof trying to save others from my own impending fragmentation\\" (214)<br />- \\"But there is no shortage of fault to be found amid our stars.\\"(112)<br />- \\"Even though I hated the sympathy people felt toward me, I couldn't help but feel it toward him.\\" (132)<br />- \\"I'm not saying it was your fault. I'm saying it wasn't nice.\\" (135)<br />- \\"'I don't smoke,' he explained, the cigarette dancing in his mouth as he spoke.\\" (146)<br />- \\"Some tourists think Amsterdam is a city of sin, but in truth it is a city of freedom. And in freedom, most people find sin.\\" (157)<br />- \\"You can't dump a girl with a brain tumor\\" (175)<br />-  He: \\"If you don't live a life in service of a greater good, you've gotta at least die a death in service of a greater good, you know? And I fear that I won't get either a life or a death that means anything...\\" She: \\"That's a really mean thing to say to me.\\" [since she hasn't done much either] (168-9)<br />- She: \\"You say you're not special because the world doesn't know about you, but that's an insult to me. I know about you.\\" (240)<br />- \\"According to Maslow, I was stuck on the second level of the pyramid, unable... to reach for love and respect and art and whatever else, which is, of course, utter horsesh--\\" (212)<br />- \\"It felt like losing your co-rememberer meant losing the memory itself\\" (262)<br />- \\"The sequel was a tiny thing to die for, but it was the biggest thing left at his disposal.\\" (304)<br />- \\"She walks lightly upon the earth. Hazel knows the truth: We're as likely to hurt the universe as we are to help it, and we're not likely to do either.\\" (312) [Contrasts with \\"You leave your scar upon me in all this, and I am perpetually grateful for your influence.\\"]

B008ODZEQ0|4.0|One would think it difficult to make an interesting movie about making sushi. And it is. But Jiro Dreams of Sushi is not a film about making sushi. It is about a man's drive for perfection, a drive that results in the dehumanization of a family. To make the perfect sushi, a man forsakes his emotions and his relationships. He does not become a tyrant, though he is a machine: mechanical, unfeeling, detached, absent, focused solely on work.<br /><br />As long as one detaches the subject from the film, one can appreciate the beauty of the film. The score and the cinematography are phenomenal. It's hard, though, to see this film without feeling great pity for the man and his family. How they yearn for their father's respect and appear never to receive it because it is never offered. I leave the film impressed by the film and the man's devotion to work, but sadenned by the devaluation of the human spirit.

B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This is one of those old fashioned, traditional Gothic horror films that is sorely under-appreciated by modern audiences.  People are too used to gore and slashers that they no longer appreciate atmosphere and being spooked by the old fashioned and imaginative.  This is the sort of horror that sticks with you, that chills you to the bone and I think that's why a lot of people don't understand it or don't appreciate it. It's one thing to be made to jump by a serious killer, it's another thing when a horror film reaches you on a deep and personal level.<br /><br />This is true to form, traditional Hammer horror.  There hasn't been a good, mysterious and haunting film like this since 1999's Sleepy Hollow starring Johnny Depp.  I miss horror films like these and it's a shame that so many people today just don't \\"Get\\" this type of horror.<br /><br />Something that disturbs me about some fans of this film are the ones that think The Woman in Black character was doing Arthur a favor at the end. She really, really, wasn't.  He was depressed but death is never the answer and no one says \\"Never forgive\\" over and over again while helping someone.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This really is an amazing knife to hold. The edge comes sharp, but could be sharper... Mine is sharper now and it holds its edge very nicely. To test it out I used it like a hatchet on the edge of a 1x12 pine board and it was cutting through the board quickly. I then tried stabbing it through the face of the 1x12 and it went right through leaving a knife shaped hole across the grain. After that I looked for signs of use on the edge of the blade and couldn't find any dulling or nicks, just some scuffing on the side of the blade. Some have complained about the grip, but if I can stab it through a 1x12 and never feel like it's gonna slip, I don't see a problem.<br /><br />This knife is well worth the money.<br /><br />Also I don't see any problems with the sheath dulling the knife. The knife is held solid but there is ample room around the edge so that the edge never contacts anything. Maybe they redesigned it?

B008645YEE|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said about Hans Zimmer's lastest and last foray into Christopher Nolon's Batman trilogy ? accept that I was looking foward to seeing James Newton Howard return to the series along side Hans Zimmer which didn't happen  due to the chemistry between Zimmer and Nolon James Newton Howard felt that he wouldv'e became a third weel this time around.I have to give credit where credit is due because I love how Hans Zimmer is so passionate about the movies he scores because it shows how commited and how dedicated he is to his craft because he puts everything  he has into his compositions and then some,unlike certain composers who decide score a couple of movies and then drop out and not only that but also Hans goes the extra mile and allows the fans  to participate in the making of the Bane's chant which is absolutely brilant what composer does that seriously major props to Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />If I had one word to decribe Hans Zimmer's performance on the dark knight rises it would be impossible to do simply there are so many ways to decribe this album as it is amazingly beautiful haunting  spine tingling which is exactly the way i felt upon my first listening of Gotham's Reckoning: which I thougth was intense especially with the chant backing Bane  half way through to 2:34  you get a sense that Bane means bussiness that chant i feel perfectly suites Bane  and his band of mercenaries as they prepare to lead Gotham into utter and complete choas.<br /><br />Mind If I Cut In: slows the Paste a little unlike Danny Elfman's perfomance for the same character of Catwoman Hans takes a more mysterious approach yet through the use of piano allows for a little romantic undertone delveloping a sense of attraction between Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />As far as the action goes Hans Zimmer delievers and delivers in spades as he has previously done with Batman Begins by remixing the music from the first film into The Dark Knight he does this again but this time combining all three scores which makes perfect sense.Christopher Nolon had stated that he wanted the story to come full circle hence why the soundtrack includes a lot of references to both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight thus allowing a sence continuity and a more satistfying listening experince  although James Newton Howard is absent from the Batcave I feel that Hans Zimmer has only proven that he was more then ready to accept the challenge of going solo and I'm glad he did.but this time combining all three scores which makes perfect sense.Christopher Nolon had stated that he wanted the story to come full circle hence why the soundtrack includes a lot of references to both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight thus allowing a sence continuity and a more satistfying listening experince  although James Newton Howard is absent from the Batcave I feel that Hans Zimmer has only proven that he was more then ready to accept the challenge of going solo and I'm glad he did.

0525953728|3.0|I downloaded the book on spot , checking every minute as when it will be released to be the first to buy and to read . The book came Without secrets and without the names and roles , which changed  the book to a simple diary of a soldier who was among a SEAL that killed Osama Bin Laden .<br /><br />Its more of a personal feeling which makes the reader sounding really fun more than informative . So the book could be conisdered \\"over advertised \\" . If you are looking for secrets and facts then this is not your book as mentioned in the first pages . It is another story added to several stories of how Bin LAden was killed and that was in a part an addition to what happened.<br /><br />You can buy it and enjoy a story without considerable answers to the question ? how, where and why ? NO exact details and time of death was disclosed. I beleive that Matt , the soldier who is known to be the one who killed Bin Laden didnot want to reveal any names . While reading you cannot know how accurate that analysis would prove true.<br /><br />I am glad that I got the book , read it and started viewing a different story than the one mentioned by President Obama team .<br /><br />Donot miss the book ..its worth reading before more stories come up.<br />aftoukan@hotmail.com<br />Toronto , Canada

I am going to add it to my 'must-see' Christmas Movies during the Holidays!I appreciate Amazon's including these genre of movies, they brighten my day!
0321704452|5.0|Terrific book! if you want to give amazing presentations, you have to read it. but, at the first time you should will read Presentation zen and Slideology ( Nancy Duarte).
1401322786|3.0|The book was released almost a week before in India.<br /><br />The book is an easy read and can be easily finished in 1-2 readings. However I would not rate it on par with the some of the other Mitch Albom's novels.<br /><br />As the book revolves around the concept of time, I was expecting more at the end of the novel.
B005KELW26|5.0|I love this. It is exactly what I was looking for. Hope the next person enjoys it as much as I have.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This story has you from the very first chapter.I could not put this book down, i was so involved with the characters i felt like i was in the story myself.I can not wait to till the next book in the series comes out.
B000RD0RDU|5.0|I bought this as a replacement for a dying fan in my AV receiver. Came on time and as spec'd (which is harder than you'd think), so it was an easy plug and play replacement. Haven't had an issue yet.
0788832182|5.0|Excellent although quite unDisney like. I loved IT and will watch it again and again.<br /><br />The focus is on what makes a family and the importance of being family. A must see for children as well as adults...
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Better than I thought it would be.  Sharpens small blades well.  Worth the money I paid for it.  Has both carbide and ceramic sharpeners.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Great read, by far the best of the 3 books but maybe I'm a sucker for a happy ending!!!  Well written and have to say all 3 books held my attention and I reluctantly closed my phone down late at nite!!  Think these will encourage adventure for all age groups & def see a baby boom in the near future!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Amazon's fantastic way of downloading to my Kindle with one click makes my day! When I saw the review of Fifty Shades of Grey, I had to have it. I was not disappointed.<br />Anastasia did not know what she was getting into, but I was glad to see her go with her heart. Christian's past rules his life but Anastasia brings the innocence that balances their affair. His past cannot be changed but he makes up for it with his ardor and masculinity. He is romantic and sexy and makes all the right moves. Be still my heart! Enjoy this book; I have a feeling that we are in for the awakening of Anastasia Steele setting her own set of rules. Go, girl. On to Book 2... My Kindle is \\"burning.\\"
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought the writing was well executed.  It bogged down a little for me in the middle of the story, but picked up when I realized that the predictable ending I was expecting wasn't going to happen.  I liked the way the author built her plot by going back and forth between the diary of the \\"supposed\\" victim and the thinking of the \\"supposed\\" guilty husband.  It was a good read and worth my while.  I also liked the psychological development of the main characters.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|What can I say I was one of those people on the fence about this one. Rihanna plus based off of a board game. Doesn't really scream successful to me. But now that I've watched it I really enjoyed it. It's not my favorite aliens attack earth kind of flick but I do prefer it to most. It was way better then I expected and I'm glad I gave it a shot. Don't expect Liam neeson and Alexander skarsgard In every scene though. But overall a great movie. 4.5/5
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book was such a ride.  I literally was only able to put it down and walk away from it 4 times.  I was hooked from the beginning and it only hooked itself deeper as the story progressed.  When I was about 3 quarters of the way through my bath water had gone cold, I pulled the plug and continued to sit and read in an empty bathtub until finally I forced myself to get out, dry off and take my kindle to bed where I read until crosseyed and yawning to the very end. READ.THIS.BOOK.  It's the first and def. not the last Crouch book I will be reading.
B0039NAVKY|3.0|Seems like the devil wears prada wasn't too far off.  Interesting movie but could've been better-wasn't sure why it was made and what the teller was trying to say.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I never did myself as a casual Wilco listener over the years, but it was in strong evidence when this album came out.  Clearly, this was a case of the fanbase bailing out a band that was called out on a terrible album.  Unfortunately for Wilco, they didn't have the sales to justify putting out a terrible album possibly even their own fans wouldn't buy.  What do they do when confronted?  They say \\"this is the album we've made and you're putting it out.\\"  As we've seen a number of times over history, this gets bands fired as happened here.  Wilco is a good band and they usually put out quality material, so the fans insisted they put out the record and another label stepped up to put it out.  To say the album confirms the negative reasons the album was shelved is an understatement.<br /><br />This album is a muddled and confused sonic experiment that doesn't add to the half-formed songs that embody it.  Yes, they do mask the material and add no additional charm in the process.  Listen to it thousands of times and nothing new will come of the album.  On another note, they have abandoned this production style largely with subsequent albums and I hope they never return to this place.  I'm guessing it was a dark time for them as a band, probably due to some drug issues as this is layers upon layers of a copout.  They have excellent, ardent fans and the devotion saved them.  Judging by the critical response a good amount of the music press were also fans. All in all, this is an example of what not to do when producing an album.  Sparklehorse has a song that flirts with the concept they were going for here and is cool to listen to, Panda Bear had a fantastic album made with a ton of noise in it, that was unnecessary but gave the music a happy subdued element it wouldn't have had otherwise. Countless other albums employ noise in an excellent way. Here, the sonic abstraction doesn't serve the songs.<br /><br />To the fans, there's no reason to lie about the quality of this album anymore.  The band, the label, and the venues they toured for this album have made their money and moved on.  Don't sell it as a masterpiece to some unsuspecting teeny bopper who's never heard of the band.
B0086DBE62|3.0|Three stars for me means, the movie was good one time.  I probably would never feel inclined to see it again.
0765316994|4.0|Today's post is on 'Reshirts' by John Scalzi. The book in total is 317 pages long with the main story being 231 pages long, three fiction shorts at the end from 235-314 and acknowledgments from 315-317. It is published by TOR. The cover is a Star Trek redshirt on it with the saying 'They were expendable... Until they started comparing notes.' on it. The intended readers is anyone who likes, Star Trek, funny sci-fi novels and meta-fiction. Once again There be Spoilers Ahead.<br /><br />The main narrative follows Ensign Anderw Dahl who has just transferred to the Universal Union's flagship The Intrepid. He is replacing another poor soul who went on an away mission. Dahl quickly realizes that this something odd about The Intrepid and away missions. Someone will die on the away mission but never the ship's captain, its chief science officer, the head engineer, the head doctor or the handsome lieutenant. There are even rules about about who will die on the away missions. Dahl begins to learn more about the tragic history of The Intrepid which was just a normal ship until five years before when anyone but those five could and would be killed by the dumbest things. With his friends who want to survive the Narrative too they do brave and stupid things to insure that. Like going back in time with only six days to stop the Narrative from killing them all.<br /><br />This book was very funny. It is third person close with the reader following Dahl as he moves into this meta self-awareness. The meta in this is pretty good. Scalzi works it into the story well and he backs it up nicely with the plot. The pokes at Star Trek are pretty obvious if you have watched either the original series or The Next Generation. There is little language in this book, when it is there I understood why, I even thought the same the words that the characters were saying/thinking. There is only hinted at sexuality so no worries about that. It was a quick read for me because I was laughing with the dialogue which is really funny and clever. But I really love when dialogue just clicks. This is also my book by Scalzi and I am so excited to read the book that made him famous which is 'Old Man's War'.<br /><br />My overall rating for Redshirts is four killed and one half maimed.ogue which is really funny and clever. But I really love when dialogue just clicks. This is also my book by Scalzi and I am so excited to read the book that made him famous which is 'Old Man's War'.<br /><br />My overall rating for Redshirts is four killed and one half maimed.

034580404X|5.0|This was a gift for my mother who really wanted it.  Ok so - she is in her 60's and so far has enjoyed the reading.  Waiting to hear more back from her but so far so good.  I will not be reading the series because I'm a sci-fi/thriller reader but anything is possible.
B005LAII94|1.0|By far the worst release in 2012. Cartoonish characters, bad acting, horrible writing, over-the-top violence, a story line that is absurd, need I continue. There is nothing redeeming about this waste of 131 minutes. When I see names like Oliver Stone and Salma Hayek I should know better than to waste hard earned money.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was a good game although. its hard to unlock the games. other than that I liked it. so make it easier to get points and its 5 star material

B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is a great, turn based, strategy game.  You have three races that each have slightly different abilities and several different maps to play.  Works great on the Kindle Fire, except sometimes the music cuts out.
0345803485|1.0|I really can't stand starting something and then not finishing it. This is true even when it comes to something I don't like reading. Even if I think a story is lame, I will usually still finish it. That is... until I read 50 Shades of Grey. I made it about half way through before I had to close it for good.<br /><br />After hearing several friends recommend this book, and given the rise in popularity of the title, I had expected something... well... good. Instead, I was reading something that seemed to have been written by a teenager. Actually, I've written works by teenagers that have been more inspired than this. The writing was simply terrible. The author overuses a lot of words and phrases (like 'inner goddess', 'ghost of a smile' and 'oh my'). This all leads to a protagonist who is incredibly dull and lifeless throughout the pages.<br /><br />I was not surprised, then, when I found out after putting the book down that it was originally written as Twilight fan fiction. I believe that's where it should have stayed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Loving the pinterest app! It's very easy to access your pins and boards and very well organized. So easy to get addicted!
B003HTPHSQ|4.0|Lauper did a pretty good job on these blues cover songs.<br /><br />None of the songs were outstanding, but her interpretations and delivery were interesting to say the least.<br /><br />I always like to listen to non blues artists, take on the blues. Most of the time, they muck them up. Cyndi only mucked up a couple of songs.<br /><br />I would rather listen to Maria Muldaur do the blues than Cyndi Lauper and hopefully her blues albums are done, but album was interesting.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|The story is written from Joey's perspective, in the first person. This was a little awkward for me at first, but Morpurgo does a good job of making the point of view believable. Joey can't talk with other people or animals, though he shares his thoughts with the reader. His interactions with others are the same as you might expect from a horse, which adds to the believability.<br /><br />Joey's limited knowledge of the world serves to add to the novel's themes. He doesn't understand boundaries, and as such there is no difference in his mind between England and France. He has no idea of nationality. He likes everybody all the same. The men around him, whether German or English or French, admire him as beautiful. Joey serves as a common thread between all people. If everyone can fall in love with a horse, then why can't they love one another, too? There's even a wonderful scene in No Man's Land where a Scotsman and a German wave a temporary truce to free Joey from barbed wire, converse about the tragedies of war, flip a coin for possession of the horse, and sadly reflect that in an hour they might be shooting at each other.<br /><br />The novel's main weakness is that Joey, as a horse, can't do much to affect the story himself. He is guided along, as if on rails, and his destiny depends on where other men take him. However, Morpurgo writes the story in such a way that this isn't much of a problem. He is a horse, anyway.<br /><br />This works well as Young Adult fiction, but even adults will find something to enjoy. While there is a lot of violence, much of it occurs outside of Joey's perspective. We know people die, but Joey rarely sees it happen. It's an easy read, and the perspective of horses in World War I is a unique topic. If you like horses and/or you're a war buff, you'll find something to enjoy here.
006198969X|5.0|i am absoluelty love this book, i have bought many books like this one and they usually dont help. This one is very spesific & tells you things that save you a lot of time.

0307272702|3.0|This book is worth a read just for its scientific breakdown of the interaction between food and hormones: it's simple, easy and very informative to understand the relationship about insulin and our bodies. IF you are new to the whole Glycemic Index idea, this will really help you understand the whole concept behind it.<br /><br />Where this book fails, even though a nutrition book couldn't focus on but so many topics, is that weight-loss is the sole and only factor that is used to gauge the success of dieting. I understand weight loss is an important issue in our obese society, but sometimes the book stumbles over itself in promoting health and well being.<br /><br />A big thing in this book is that exercise does not help you lose weight. While I know there are other views that could counter the one presented in the book, the author does a good job of explaining why working out can work against you. He practically then throws out exercise as something that is rather optional, depending if you like it or not. But what about reducing the risk of several types of cancer, CVD, depression, anxiety? Or increase in self-esteem and energy from all the positive hormones? Well if it doesn't help you lose weight, it's out of the picture.<br /><br />The same can happen with food. While books like [[ASIN:0061172286 SuperFoods Rx: Fourteen Foods That Will Change Your Life]] will tell us about the studies that show how these foods can reduce our risks for various diseases, Why We Get Fat would say yes to only 5 out of the 14 superfoods presented in the other book. If it has the chance of adding to your waistline, even if it is a couple servings of fruit, it's best to stay away.<br /><br />This calorie in/calorie out vs. types of calories battle is an important one to have. It is obvious that calorie in and calorie out is over simplistic, doesn't show us the real picture and doesn't benefit our health. The problem is now that people want to sway us all the way to the other side: that you can eat as much as you want, ignore the calories, just focus on what type it is. Trading one extreme for another won't do us any good. While this book will have some great insight to losing weight, it might not give us a full picture.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|P.D.James must be as big a fan and avid reader of Jane Austin as I am.  What a delight to get an extension of my favorite Pride and Prejudice as we see Elizabeth Bennett and Darcy (Fitzwilliam) in their married life at Pemberly.  Of course, there is a murder, which makes other familiar family members surface and show their true selves (Lydia is as giddy and irresponsible as ever).  The court room scenes sound true to the period.  I was on the edge of my seat to the end.  The unravelling even ties in other Jane Austin characters.  If Ms. James sees herself clear to write a sequel I will be at the top of the line for another great adventure.
B006WXHJTO|1.0|The only funny part of this movie was when Jason Biggs character shaved his junk and it ended up on his wedding cake.  Most of the original cast wasn't present which really made this movie suck, and overall the story just wasnt that good.  The first was great the second was alright, but this one could have been avoided.  I would only get this movie if I purchased it in a set with the other 2.  If you see American Reunion there are soo many things you wouldnt understand if you didnt watch the first or second.  Cant say missing American Wedding would cause any confusion in American Reunion.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is seriously amazing. I would recommend it to anyone. At first, I wasn't too sure about buying it... It was $5... But I thought it looked legit, so I went for it. It's pretty much minecraft, but fit for a tablet or a phone. I love it.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|This is just a cash-in of a very well-done, popular book. It's obvious that it was rushed and not much care was put into it. It's for young adults. Back when I was a teen, I would have thought something like this was probably amazing. It's one of those movies that no one would realize was mediocre until growing up. Numerous important details and events are left out, things that would set the mood. This was a cheaply done production. I had Lawrence in my mind as I read the book, and honestly, she did not strike me as the same Katniss in the book. She is a lousy actress that's barely there. I wouldn't pay her anything for this role. The studio is paying $10 million for her in the role? I could find a better actress for that money! The girl is a glorified extra! If I had to grade her Hollywood career, it would be an F. She mumbles her lines, and generally is not passionate about her job. I would love to be an actor in Hollywood! I would overact to the point people would complain about me on Amazon! However, Lawrence looks like she would rather be working in a salt mine. She always looks bothered to be working. I try to picture her in future productions, and I can't. She just wouldn't fit in. She has no future in this business.<br /><br />I don't know who anointed Lawrence to be the next \\"it\\" girl in Hollywood, but they're wrong. I don't hate her, she's sweet. However, I don't think acting is in her future.<br /><br />I think a much better version of The Hunger Games, in film version, is Battle Royale. It goes above and beyond this movie itself, because it can do things a PG-13 movie in America can't. I highly recommend that film.
0345803507|5.0|This book met all my expectations.  I couldn't put it down.  It was everything that I have read it would be.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Loved this book!  It was written well, interesting, exciting and could see this series becoming a movie.  I read this book wanting to read the entire trilogy, which I did.  This book kept my attention eventhough I normally don't read these types of books.  Some may find the sexual content offensive but it was written tastefully and I recommend it for mature women not teenagers.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was amazing!  My book club enjoyed reviewing it together.  Everyone seemed to get something different out of it.  I believe it would be very interesting to read whether your a man, or woman.  It's a very heavy subject.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I rarely review products but really wanted to emphasize how helpful this has been for me. I was so excited to get my new MacBook Pro w/ Retina Display but my biggest concern was not having an ethernet port, especially because at school I have bad WiFi in a lot of buildings and used my ethernet cord all the time in previous years with my old MacBook. Once again this year at school, I found that my WiFi was awful, specifically in the building I live in-obviously this is an enormous problem so I immediately bought this and hoped for the best, as some reviewers had said it didn't work for them. I had absolutely no problems the first time I used it, did not have to do any sort of updates or set anything up, I just plugged it in and it worked and has worked every day very well for me. I am so thankful for this because it really has been a lifesaver. The price isn't bad either (even though I still think Apple should supply one of these with each new MacBook Air/Pro that has no ethernet port) so I consider this a must have for anyone with no ethernet port on their computer.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I'm using this to extend a mouse from one room to the next, and it works perfectly.  No issues with connectivity or power transmission, although my mouse hardly consumes a lot of power.  Great buy
B00913DPW2|5.0|I loved it! Graphics were fantastic games challenging but not too easy or hard, did need some help, though.  If all their games are like this one, I'm getting every one.  Only issue I had was no zoom, there's so much detail and I am playing on a Droid. This is also the first game that took me more than a few hours to complete.  So many rooms to explore and things to find, it was WELL worth the couple bucks I spent on it.  Thanks to the developers, great job!
B008XG1X18|4.0|cant stay away from it!  the apps does hang from time to time,  which is a bummer! for me this just like a big map where i collect all my ideas for future use!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I love this game but kindle fire users lose all progress with updates and have to buy danger zone levels more than once sad
B004T4KQJS|5.0|The nice thing about the book is that you don't need to understand deeply quantum mechanics or general relativity to have a glance over the implications from the late XX century discoveries in our philosophical reasoning about how things came to be. Very accessible.
B004LROUNG|1.0|I often wonder why a successful author would lower himself to penning a novel that is so thin and transparent with no real reason to be written other than to proffer the \\"author\\" more profit. I have enjoyed most of Grisham's past endeavors as light reading, great for trains, planes and automobiles as well as beach and pool. I even felt some message and meaning to one or two of them, such as Runaway Jury. But this was a dissappointment on so many levels. The writing was poor, the story weak, the characters unappealing. I certainly did not expect War and Peace but I did hope for something more engaging. Read at you own risk with your own expectations.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|...for how horrible this book is.  If marking as ZERO stars was an option, that would have been my choice.  I purchased due to the \\"buzz\\" and barely made it halfway thru before gladly setting it aside.  With so many brilliant authors and stories out there, dont waste your money or time on this trash.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Wow! I really enjoyed this book.  Not the most well written book, but still good.  I learned a new thing or two that could be good fun.<br />The next two were purchased and read very quickly after the first one.
B000784WMW|3.0|Apparently, there are several versions of this production of Jane Eyre available: the original five-and-a-half-hour version, a five-hour (?) version, and a four-hour version.  I bought my copy last year, and it's the full version.  The problem is the video quality: Almost six hours of material is crammed onto one double-sided DVD!  As a result, the picture has the quality of streaming video: choppy with poor resolution.  So, my three-star rating reflects how cheaply this DVD is produced.  The program, however, is probably the definitive production of Jane Eyre.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked this book a lot more when I started it compared to when I finished it. I thought the ending was lame and disappointing.

B008D1RCI6|5.0|This is a beautiful and meaningful album.  I had never heard of Bill Fay until I heard a track from this album on an Uncut magazine sampler, and I was hooked...the world weary voice, the thoughtful arrangements and beautiful melodies, and yes, the fact that someone who was able to cut several albums forty years ago has survived and is still willing to communicate with us about this strange journey of life. ( I wish Judee Sill were still alive and could come back from obscurity...it seems like she and Bill Fay were on a similar wavelength back in the early '70s.)<br /><br />The two highlights on this album for me are \\"The Never Ending Happening\\" and \\"Cosmic Concerto.\\"  I am seriously considering telling my husband to have \\"The Never Ending Happening\\" played at my funeral.  The song conveys so much gratitude for the gift of life inspite of the difficulties of being human.<br /><br />There are two weaker tracks -- \\"This World\\" has an aggressive pop sensibility and tempo that seem out of place to me (even Jeff Tweedy can't save this song), and \\"Thank You Lord\\" just doesn't seem very interesting to me.  However, on the strength of the two abovementioned classics and the other tracks, this is still a five star album.<br /><br />One of the reviewers here complained that the lyrics are trite.  A few are a bit hackneyed, but Fay is like Van Morrison to me, in having a voice that can convey more than words, and who can make even repeated simple lyrics seem meaningful.  Yes, there are many Christian/spiritual references on the album, but this is in no way Christian Rock or any other genre whose main goal is to push a viewpoint on others.  The religious references seem to come from an authentic place, and don't require your assent.<br /><br />Kudos to the people who organized the recording and release of this album.  I'll be checking out Bill Fay's earlier work as soon as I can.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I have not yet seen season 5 of the show, but I own seasons 1 through 4 on DVD (and have seen them all multiple times) and among these season 4 is my clear favorite. From other reviews here I understand that many viewers had problems with the addition of the new characters Priya, Bernadette, and particularly Amy. I must admit that I cannot agree with this opinion at all. I think all three characters are lovely in their particular way and they serve a good reason in the show. For instance, although most people probably won't root for Priya and Leonard to get married any time soon, the intrdouction of Priya opens Penny's eyes to see what she has lost. Probably, the first step of bringing Leonard and Penny back together eventually - something that would certainly find the applause of most Big Bang Theory fans. Bernadette and Amy, in turn, have together with Penny formed a \\"girl group\\" that now exists opposing to the four nerds around Sheldon, and which makes a lot of story lines possible that otherwise could not have been followed on the show. Of course, both characters bring with them the danger to eventually tame Howard and Sheldon - which some seem to perceive as actually happening - but I feel that the story writers have been very careful to avoid this obvious pitfall. For instance, although Sheldon got his \\"girlfriend\\" in this season, he is nevertheless the exact same socially inept and sexually uninterested nerd that he was in season 1. Only Howard's character has been limited somewhat by his relationship with Bernadette. However, this relationship created a lot of new funny situations, so that I would conclude that overall the show has actually benefitted from this minor compromise. Both Howard and Sheldon remain to be hilarious characters.<br /><br />In another review I had read that now only Penny and Sheldon were essential for the show to work. I completely disagree on that - particularly for this season. The show has now seven well-balanced main characters (eight if you include Priya), all of which play key roles. I would not want to miss one of them! And the extended cast will allow a lot of story lines for the future.<br /><br />I just completed watching this season for the seventh time. And I will surely watch it again. This is one of the best shows ever, and this is - in my view - its best season. There is not a single weak episode. I particularly like \\"The Herb Garden Germination\\" - Amy at her best! I highly recommend these DVDs!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Riordon does it again!!! An amazing book full of details and creativeness. It has many twists and turns that keep you turning the pages spellbound to the absolute end and keeps you begging for more.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Let me get started by saying, wow!!!!  Season 2 has just been released and let me say, how totally awesome this show really is.  The first season was sweet and fantastic at the same time.  Then season two, I have just finished watching and I am still blown away.  However, with that being said, I have had more problems with this season, than that of the former season.<br />  The second season starts out and wham your being thrown back into fray of the end of the world and the remaining members of the group.  After the beginning of the season premiere the little girl gets seperated and the season takes a turn for the worse.  About half-way through the season, I feel that the show stayed with this idea too long and should have moved on to another main focal point for the show. The season gets somewhat back on track after the end of episode five or six.  But, overall I gave this season 5 stars just because this show is awesome.  After watching the final episode, I tell myself that in October Season 3 aires on AMC, and I can't wait.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is increasible. I was even able to play Minecraft on my computer with it. It was hard to control but it was there. I like this app as much as I need it. AND IT'S INVALUABLE TO ME!
