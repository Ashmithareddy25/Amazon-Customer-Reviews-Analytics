B0059XTUB8|2.0|\\"My Week With Marilyn\\", is based on Colin Clark's account of his time spent with Monroe during the making of the 1956 film \\"The Prince and The Showgirl\\" when the superstar was 30 years old.  Michelle Williams embodies the troubled young starlet without always looking like Marilyn. Her performance, along with a strong cast including Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Redmayne, Dame Judi Dench,and Julia Ormond cannot, however, overcome what essentially is a rather boring story about a boring young man who spent a short time with the sexiest woman in the world.  The film can be appreciated for it's period costuming, acting and behind the scenes film-wthin-a-film but not for it's weak plot.
B003U55NV8|5.0|This show is awesome...period.  This show is by far the best...period.  This is my favorite show in the world...period.  The End.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Fun, fast paced. Quite a bit of surprises, high moments and fascinating world. Great character development.<br /><br />The ending is a nice closure for this one book with the door wide open for a follow-up which I will wait eagerly for.

B009JNXK88|5.0|I loved this game. This brings me back to the days of 8 bit. Even the music is fantastic. I would finish typing up this review but I need to get back to playing LEAGUE OF EVIL!!!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Worth seeing but not alien good. Great special effects and some white knuckle moments, could have been better. Enjoyable, glad I didn't shell out the money at the theater.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game. My grandkids love it also. You have to play it. It is awesome you have to try it.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|these mono remasters sound magnificent, theyre perfectly balanced, these are better than even the mfsl, the vocals on the mfsl are more prominent and have more clarity but on these mono remasters you can hear the instruments better and these have a fuller overall sound while even background sounds have great clarity, and listening to these you hear the beatles music how john, paul, george and ringo intended

B007GCY8FS|2.0|A Wanted Man did not live up to expectations.  It does not compare to previous Jack Reacher novels.  It lacks suspense and intrique.  Very disappointing.
B000V3OKW0|5.0|These works are a formidable challenge for any cellist and there are several fine recordings available. I have the versions by Pierre Fournier (on Archiv DGG) and by Paul Tortelier (on EMI) in my collection and I am equally happy listening to either. I have also heard portions of the recordings by Mstislav Rostropovich and by Yo-Yo Ma, which to my ears are equally brilliant and absorbing.  Each Suite is a collection of six Baroque dances: a Prelude, Allemande, Courante, Sarabande, Gavotte or Bour&eacute;e or Minuet, and a final Gigue. I would have to agree with the reviewer who said that these were very intense performances and that other interpretations do make the music 'swing' more - they are after all dances! But I use these for meditation, so no problem. These are 2CD collections with 3 Suites complete on each CD. I am sure you would find any of these interpretations equally spiritually uplifting, even in the slower movements.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0002VEPNA Bach: Cello Suites]]
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was surprised that it did not have a fairy tale ending,  and that it was more the way real life is,  if given lemons,  make lemonade.  I was pestered to read this series by a co-worker. And though it was a series for young adults, I actually enjoyed the adult themes on politics and the difficult subject of nation building, after a post-apocalyptic event.
B005IGDW24|4.0|This was a wonderful movie! The smurfs look great, and Gargamel was spot on. Neil Patrick Harris did a spectacular job also. The voices for the Smurfs were perfectly cast. Everything about this movie I loved, until I put in the 3D blu ray. There were maybe there spots in the whole movie where the 3D was noticeable. There was hardly even any depth to the movie. Even my kids were dissatisfied with the 3D and they are 7 and 5. Most of the 3D showed up right at the very end of the movie. If you are looking for a good family movie, this is it, but if you want a good family 3D movie this is not, try Madagascar 3 or The Lorax, both them were great! So if you want this movie get the Blu Ray version, you get The Smurfs Christmas Carol disc with the regular blu ray, but not with the 3D version.
B0060D11OU|5.0|A Classic that we introduced to our children. Although it shows it's age some, I love Mary Poppins and my children enjoyed the music and the movie, especially the chalk art and \\"I love to laugh\\" scenes!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|So much fun, lol, great way to 'relax' in the evening and get ready for zzzz time.  This game is such a hit.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great Film, well written script. Good Choice of Actors.<br />Awesome from Beginning to the end. It is a must have in your movie collection.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|Very clever, very clear, immediately useful. It´s hard not to look at ads / news / speeches in a different way now.<br /><br /> The examples are very memorable, and I find myself bringing them up in conversation.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game. lots of fun. :-) I really enjoy it. thanks for the halloween update. my kids really enjoy it too. I wish there was a way to restart the game.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|The movie was a little slow but why it was rated R I don't know. I've seen much worse rated less then this. I agree with another reviewer that in the end he was not crazy. Spoiler alert: if he had the oily rain on his hand I'd say otherwise but his wife had it so I think it was really happening this time. The end is very sad because with all he went through to prepare and make a shelter he and his little family probably ended up dead because they had no where to \\"shelter\\". I hate endings that leave you hanging. In my mind they ran and some neighbors who had been watching them and had prepared a shelter because of \\"mental warnings\\" allowed them in just in the nick of time. Maybe pulling them over the railing of their deck kind of like what happened in the car wreck scene.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|With several story lines going on at the same time, I never found myself bored. It was a hard book to put down and I'm looking forward to reading the next books.
B007P7UF06|4.0|Haven't seen this in years, and great fun to see this absolutely beautiful version on Blu-Ray.  Also included was documentary footage of the premiere of the film, very interesting time capsule of days gone by.<br /><br />This was first a wonderful Broadway show with Richard Burton as the King, introducing Robert Goulet, perfectly cast as Lancelot, and a young and impossibly talented Julie Andrews in the female lead.  For the movie musical -- Jack Warner's last hurrah with movie musicals -- Richard Harris as the king -- terrific -- Franco Nero as Lancelot, who was dubbed for singing, perfectly, and Nero was just fine, and a radiant Vanessa Redgrave as Guinevere.  Lionel Jeffries terrific as comic relief, playing King Pellinore, who's been looking for his own kingdom for years, which he lost in the woods.<br /><br />Not a huge hit when released, as movie musicals were fading, and didn't make back all the money lavished on it, but terrific music and lyrics by Lerner & Lowe, who had earlier had a huge hit with the movie musical version of My Fair Lady.  Alan J. Lerner also wrote this screenplay.  On Broadway, of course, My Fair Lady also starred the wonderful Julie Andrews.  She later went on to score big with Mary Poppins and Sound of Music on the big screen.<br /><br />This is another example of the sheer joy of seeing a movie you like, one you haven't seen in theaters since its first release, or never saw in theaters at all, and may have seen from time to time on standard def TVs.  Suddenly you're seeing this with a Blu Ray player on a widescreen, flatscreen, hi-def, and WOW.  Just beautiful, restored, I think, to full length, with an Intermission, and an Entr'acte during Intermission, and then you're ready to enjoy the second half of the film.<br /><br />Franco Nero reappeared from time to time in Hollywood films, like one of the Die Hard films as the bad guy, but mostly worked in Europe, where he began.  Incredibly, he eventually married Vanessa Redgrave, and the two are still married today.  They met, of course, and fell in love, on the set of this film, which makes the whole thing more interesting, don't you think?<br /><br />Suspend your disbelief in magic, and whatever else you have to suspend to be drawn into a wonderful, old fashioned movie musical.  Jack Warner spent a fortune on production, and it's all up on the screen, and pays off big time with your hi-def Blu Ray setup.  Certainly a wonderful film to share with children, and, as Hollywood liked to say back in the day, with \\"children of all ages.\\"<br /><br />P.S.  The son of Richard Harris played (very well) the British partner of what began as the advertising firm \\"Sterling Cooper\\" on AMC's \\"Mad Men.\\"wo are still married today.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I haven't read it myself, but my wife has---or at least she tried to.  She gave up on it about halfway through; she tells me it's infested with misspellings, mispunctuations, omitted words, incomplete sentences, gaps in the plot---inconstencies in the story, the action, the characters and the overall logic.....not to mention all the foul language.  I know my wife's likes and dislikes, and I respect her opinions in matters of literature, so I'm reluctant to read the book myself---at least, for now.  One day, perhaps, when curiosity finally gets the better of me.....<br /><br />We both loved the Harry Potter tales, so it's terribly sad that her first post-Potter book should make such a poor showing. Has Ms. Rowling been ill, perhaps? If so, please pray for her immediate recovery.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I got this book at my brothers's reccomendation.  I'm very glad , too, because this is one of the best books i've read in a while.  I also saw the movie last night-  movie adaptation are tricky, and while they did a great job with it, movies seldom have the depth, development, and sensitivity a good book has.  a great read and highly recommended!

0765367297|5.0|I have just finished the book and I am left with 2 feelings. First, I want to switch on my X-box console and start playing and relive the events I have just been reading about and second, I want more. I want to continue reading this story because it completes the game in such a way I never could have imagine. I haven't read a book in maybe 10 years but this one made me want to read more. Very easy read and excitement escalates page after page.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|THE BOOK IS A PAGE TURNER FROM THE OUTSET, IT IS ANOTHER OF THE NELSON DEMILLE BOOKS THAT YOU HAVE TO  FORCE YOURSELF TO PUT DOWN BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT IT TO END.THIS MAN IS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR HANDS DOWN...HIS USE OF  CHARACTERS , JOHN COREY, COMBINED WITH ANOTHER OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS FROM PREVIOUS NOVELS \\"JOHN BRENNER\\" IS A STROKE OF GENIUS, I SINCERELY HOPE HE PAIRS THESE TWO IN A FUTURE NOVEL. MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT THE BOOK IS NOT 2000 PAGES IN LENGTH.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Zero Day is a great read and engaging for a wide variety of reasons. First of all it's written by a Microsoft genius. Secondly the technical aspects in the book are a welcome addition to main stream fiction reading. Lastly Mark does a great job capturing some of the political influences and character personalities. I'm about 1/3 of the way through and definitely look forward to reading his next book!
B009O8L72Y|5.0|Just when I think NCIS: LA can't get any more intense it does. This one had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  With an interesting premise and even some fun dog scenes I really enjoyed this episode.
1451695195|3.0|I was very excited to get this book, and I'm glad Dr. Alexander wrote it for those who thought highly of it. But as for me, I'm having a difficult time staying interested in it... it seems as if it is more of a scientific lesson as opposed to his NDE experience itself. Perhaps it was difficult for a scientist to put it into the prospective that would pervay a typical layman, such as myself to be provided with the knowledge he was trying to impart. It was full of info about the author and his family and life, but very little about the afterlife and not very informational at all. He seems to me as if this is more of an autobiography which what this is to me, feeling it was more of a science lesson then the actual experience of the NDE, which I found to be lacking in detail and his actual experience.He does not really talk about Jesus or God.<br /> Then when it came to the pages where he was describing the 'mediums, intuitives and channelers\\", I come to an abrupt halt in wanting to read further. Once upon a time I used to play with and possible believe in those types of things...but not any longer. The Bible says these things about this:<br /><br />Leviticus 20:6 ESV<br /><br />\\"If a person turns to mediums and necromancers, whoring after them, I will set my face against that person and will cut him off from among his people.<br /><br />Leviticus 19:31 ESV<br /><br />\\"Do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out, and so make yourselves unclean by them: I am the Lord your God.<br /><br />Deuteronomy 18:10-12<br />There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination or tells fortunes or interprets omens, or a sorcerer or a charmer or a medium or a necromancer or one who inquires of the dead, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord. And because of these abominations the Lord your God is driving them out before you.<br /><br />1 John 4:1 ESV<br />Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.<br /><br />Matthew 7:15<br /><br />\\"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.<br /><br />Leviticus 20:27 ESV / 40 helpful votes<br /><br />\\"A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones; their blood shall be upon them.\\"<br /><br />I am not convinced by this book that Dr. Alexander had a true NDE \\"of the Lord or<br />Heaven\\". But it is not for me to judge him or his book. It is simply my opinionve every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.<br /><br />Matthew 7:15<br /><br />\\"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.<br /><br />Leviticus 20:27 ESV / 40 helpful votes<br /><br />\\"A man or a woman who is a medium or a necromancer shall surely be put to death.

B0072OFOM6|5.0|AWESOME!!!
B008Q09K2U|3.0|Nelson DeMille has been my favourite author for some time and i was excited by the prospect of reading his latest book . I thought the main character, John Corey , was a little too glib this time<br />considering his desperate circumstances in an over-radical war torn mid-east.Whilst the storyline and characters at times showed great DeMille potential the book never came close to his best writing such as his previous book on the same subject , The Lion .I was extremely dissatisfied with the ending and i actually thought i'd missed the penultimate chapter ! If the book had been written by a different author i'd say fair enough , but come on Mr DeMille , you can do better than that .
B008ZTVQLA|5.0|Ian Hunter rocks oan his new album,\\"If I Were President\\"..the best album I've heard this year, and probably one of the best singles ever!..the whole album is good, and if this were a bigger label,and the world were not caught up with dubstep, this would be #1
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Chaplain was a classic production, accurate documentation, and great casting. Robert Downey was great, and it was a special connection to have Geraldine Chaplin in the portrayal of Charlie's mother. I love movies set in a different time period, with accuracy.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You is a great book.  I like how both Gideon and Eva work through their own issues. Together they start to help each other work on their issues as a couple and as individuals, too.  I think that as their relationship grows so does their acceptance, the tolerance when needed to be there and get through the bad stuff when it happens. Even when each one needs to escape for his or her own mental and emotional salvage, the other's love for the other shines through, sometimes eventually, to let the other know that he or she \\"gets it\\". Although, Gideon needs to work on his empathy. Through all of it they know that its part of their baggage and they need to work with each other to move on.  Yes, the sex is great for them, and I also see how they both need it and crave it because its their way of feeling loved and needed.  I don't feel that they use the sex to escape, because as a couple they are becoming aware and intune to the \\"triggers\\" and use sex to get beyond their baggage together.  I read her books over and over picking up new meanings with each read.  I couldn't put the book down, read the second one in the same week.  I have now gone on and started reading them again. I know many people compare these books with Shades of Grey, I loved both authors and couldn't put both down.  Bared to You explored relationships in a different way since not only did the main two characters have \\"baggage\\" but if you analyze each character in the book, all have \\"baggage\\" and Silvia Day does an incredible job bringing each of those characters into life and how their baggage intermingles with Gideon's and Eva's.  I cannot wait till the 3rd book comes out...next Spring is tooooooooooo far away!!!
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Wonderful classic story. Captivating and charming. I watched it with my daughters. We all loved it. We all agree that we are watching this together. The music, voices, graphics, all well done.
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|Really disappointed! I realize it was supposed to be a musical but even from that perspective it was disappointing. Especially with an all star cast!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|The Lucky One was a great read.  It was heartwarming, passionate and at times- maddening.  I would certainly recommend this book.  The characters are well developed and lovable, I flew through the book in 2 days!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This one rewards repeated viewing.  The first time you see it, it can be hard to keep things straight with the long flashback near the beginning.  The second or third time, things come clear; from then on you can fully enjoy the excellent production.<br /><br />How few films with such a theme, are this well done.  And Albert Finney.  Delicious, memorable, profitable.  Recently my wife caught the last part and said \\"Wonderful!\\"
B0064BWE8U|5.0|I laughed and cried but I honestly loved it. Kinsella always knows how to make a girl smile. Well enjoyed
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is a compelling historical read. It's as entertaining as it is informative.I can't wait to read the second part of the trilogy.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Easy process with purchase and download, excellent show full of suspense, can't wait for next season. Will buy next season when available.

B006LSZECO|1.0|What to say about this manipulative, facile piece of... well, you get the idea. Selected for my book group, I will now think twice before bestowing credit on the bestseller list, upon which this book resides.<br />Making an escapade with a true sociopath does have its charms, I'm sure, but this book doesn't. I don't know who I liked less, the husband or the wife. If you can't care about either character, you've made a hapless journey with both. The ending, in which the husband crumples like a cheap suit, is the most disappointing finale for a trashy novel that I have ever read. Reading it did have one good outcome: I ran straight back into the brilliant arms of George Eliot and \\"Middlemarch,\\" where I belong.
B009QW7HMC|3.0|I did not like this episode as much as others. Maybe it was because I was wondering what was happening to<br />the characters with whom I was familiar. The episode was well done...so well acted it was almost creepy.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I enjoy playing the game .. it 's a great way to pass time. The dragons are so cute. All should play it.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Great writing. Fantastic and embroiled plot.  I really enjoyed reading this, but I wonder now if I only liked it because I had the next book in the series in the wings. What I don't like about the &#34;NikkiHeat&#34; books is that they don't stand alone.
B002MGGM9I|5.0|Donnie Darko is a high school stufent that is plagued by black outs and premonitions of the future. He's visited in his dreams by a rabbit that tells him of the terrifying  things that he will soon experience. Can he change the future or is he doomed to stand by and watch his nightmares become a reality.<br /><br />Despite having a cast that I don't particularly care for, this movie is awesome. I usually think Jake Gyllenhaal is kind of flat and boring. In this movie he is exactly that. The good news is that his character is very strange. His acting style suits the role perfectly. I'm not really sure why, but I've never liked Drew Barrymore either. Fortunately her role isn't big enough to hurt the film. Patrick Swayze,0 Mary McDonnell, and Jenna Malone also do a great job at their respective roles. This a movie about the future, the past, and most certainly the present. The concept of time traveling through a wormhole is also a major theme here. The soundtrack, the screenplay and the dialogue all come together beautifully to make this one of my favorite all time movies. The story is complex and the movie needs to be watched several times to get everything that is thrown at you. I definitely believe that everyone should see this movie. It's a masterpiece.
B002ZBJ6SY|5.0|A great Seether album!! One of their first and so good!!! Great Songs! A lot of feeling in this album!
B003EYVXYG|4.0|In the midst of a zombie apocalypse there is a fabled island off the coast of Delaware where the zombie plague has not reached. The Island is inhabited by 2 Irish families. The families are fighting for control and over the morality of killing the infected.  They go to war with eachother and many people die. Although the plot is different, the story does overlap the story in the 1st movie. In a pretty cool way at that.<br /><br />This is the sequel to Diary of the Dead. Diary of the Dead is one of my favorite zomie films. Although this movie isn't quite as good as the 1st, it's still pretty good. I think it's worth renting. I'm not gonna tell you to break down and buy it b/c everyones opinion can differ; but I think you should rent it and make your call after that. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I do.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I play this before on my last kindle fire and loved it. But I have not found out how to switch size Im pretty sure no one can. But the worst problem is downloading it. I can't get past the installing part... I won't be able to play this game if I can't download it can I? But still this is a awesome game so everyone play it if you can get past the installing!!!
6305090564|4.0|Kaboom! Smash! Bang! Scream! That pretty much sums up this movie. It's a way over the top action flick. That's not a bad thing though. Hijackers board a luxury cruise ship and find only a few survivors. The passengers were all killed by some kind of giant tentacled sea monster. The hijackers boat is wrecked and they have to find a way to survive.<br /><br />There is plenty of gore, comedy, and action in this movie. It's one of those films that makes you go, \\"wow! I didn't know people could get killed that way! The plot is kinda thin; but with all the awesome action it doesn't matter. If you want a wild ride then this movie doesn't disappoint.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|there is a quiet elegance and drama to this series.it is interestiong to see the styles and history of the bygone era
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|Five people are trapped in an elevator in a skyscraper. The power keeps going on and off. Each time the lights come back on someone else in the elevator is dead. The remaining people are frantic and suspicious of one another. This results in chaos. The twist is that one of the people is actually the Devil.<br /><br />This movie is pretty good. I've always thought that Shyamalan's films are pretty cool until the end. Usually I'm very let down by his movies. The end comes and you're left thinking, \\"really?\\" This movie has a better ending than some of his others. It's actually pretty gratifying. Even though this movie is good; it's a far cry from being great. Even so it's definitely worth renting it. I'm not sure it's one you wanna go out and buy though.
B008K3HRF0|3.0|Yeah I get the message.  Nature is good.  People are bad.  Ecology is pure. Business is corrupt.  In some senses, the film captures the essence of the Suess story but in other ways the Hollywood spin takes it over the top. Still, There are a couple of catchy songs and a decent cast of voice characterizations ---EXCEPT for Danny Devito as The Lorax! Baaaaaad idea.  But, hey it's fun and my kids like it.  At least they are getting a lesson in how self destructive greed can be and how important responsible use of natural resources is.  Better than most of the morally bankrupt schlock being served up to our kids today.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|This movie came out of nowhere. It's got a pretty original plot and a very good cast. The special effects are very good as well. It's about a man that leads a team of soldiers on a mission to relocate an alien colony at Johannesburg. The aliens are stuck on Earth after their ship has been damaged. While on the relocation Vickers is contaminated by a pathogen that begins transforming him into one of the aliens. He's hunted by his own people and not accepted by the aliens. He teams up with an alien scientist and together they attempt to repair the ship and escape before they are killed.<br /><br />This movie is very good. It hasa great mix of action, comedy, and drama. District 9 is definitely not a movie you want your kids to see though. It's got a lot of violence and profanity. If that stuff doesn't bother you then this is a great movie to own. It definitely does not disappoint.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book, I really enjoyed reading it. I did not want to put it down, if fact I didn't very many times. I thought it was very unusual being told from a dog's point of view and through the eyes of a dog.
B000SZK41M|5.0|John McClane is new in L.A. His wife and her co-workers are taken hostage at an office Christmas party. Officer McClane goes to save everyone, but there is fierce resistence and a brilliant criminal mastermind waiting to stop him.<br /><br />This is probably the best Die Hard movie. The action, cast, and screenplay are all very good. Alan Rickman plays the role of the villain, and I think he's awesome in all of his movies. There's a lot you can say about Die Hard, but I'll keep it brief and just say \\"It's awesome, you have got to see this classic action movie\\".
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Typically Grisham...twists and turns all the way through. Could not put it down! I keep thinking Mr. Grisham can't get any better, and he continues to captivate me with the plots and over all story line. Terrific!

B007MB5OCE|1.0|The main character is  a Northern European Forest Gump with a mean streak, no empathy, and a bunch of hoodlums for friends.  Trite and uneven  - either a unimaginative  author or a bad translator or both.

B003TOMAPC|5.0|I am not gonna write a huge review of this movie. All I will say is AWESOME!!!!!!! I love Hit Girl & Big Daddy!!! Their relationship is so sweet even when they are out killing bad guys. Kick Ass did what so many of us say we would do, sans costume, which is stop the bad guys & make the world a better & safer place. I have seen this movie several times & will see it several more. I hope they make a sequel...it would be AWESOME!!!!!!!!
0553801473|5.0|A Dance With Dragons cast light both across the Narrow Sea and beyond The Wall. I've seen reviews where readers complain that Martin has left the mainstream of the tale to wander far off, stalling perhaps. These readers would like a \\"logical\\" sequence to A Feast For Crows that one would be able to tell it's conclusion before reading it. Thanks Heaven Martin is anything but predictable! I have one complain though. I've finished reading it and Martin hasn't released the sixth book yet. Boy, this is going to be a long wait.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|The Alien movies have had some ups and downs.  Obviously, the original was wonderful...not for the special effects, but for the fear of the unknown.  This movie was highly anticipated and left me feeling quite disappointed.  It seemed more of a galactic human origins documentary than a sci-fi horror.  The alien seemed fake and even disproportionate at many points.  However what put me off was the story line itself.  It was almost like someone was trying to convey their belief of the origins of mankind through a sci-fi movie.  I enjoyed the suspense of the original...that is what made it scary, not some profound  \\"let's make the audience think\\" story.  Overall, a letdown for me personally...glad I rented it through Amazon, instead of seeing it in the theater.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to move from book to book so easily. I also like the lit background so I canread it in the dark. I enjoy reading different versions of the Bible too.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|good game...can zoom in to get a better look at stuff. use the map in the notebook to tell where there is still stuff to do.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This is a helpful, straightforward set of instructions for creating a Kindle version of any book that exists in Microsoft Word format. It references Word 2010, but all of the necessary editing/saving features are available in Word 2003.<br /><br />To really polish the look and behavior of a Kindle book, it helps to know a bit of HTML, so that you can work with the filtered HTML file that Kindle uses to convert into the Kindle format. (Fortunately, I have that knowledge and was able to use a combination of the downloadable viewer and a basic text editor to make a really beautiful and robust version of my book.) But even without such knowledge, the final product is entirely workable, readable, and sell-able.<br /><br />And, of course, this book is free and written by the Amazon folks, which makes it a logical starting point for the process.
B004NELBPC|5.0|I use this as my first news review in the morning as in general tends to cover most worthy news,of course news are by and large subjective, predigested and biased opinions presented as news by most,however it does present an overall picture without much pandering to special interests and is not offensive as some that are presented to the intellectually challenged public.<br />If an item interest me then will more likely explore other venues of information to corroborate,educate myself and make an informed opinion,like they used to tell during the flower revolution, \\"do not trust authority\\"
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game.  The coins go pretty fast, I wish they would replenish faster than 30 seconds.  All in all not a bad way to pass some care free, no-need-to-think time.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|This just was not at all entertaining.  I couldn't stop watching because I was waiting for it to get better and it did not.  The two teenage kids even left after watching it half way through.  Bummer, I love Johnny, but this was not good.
B008Q09K2U|5.0|Another excellent piece of John Corey fiction - couldn't put it down! Nelson I hope you are already penning your next novel!
0060254920|5.0|I bought \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" for my great grandson who is 5 years old. He was frightened of the pictures. I think as he gets older he will enjoy it.
B004HD61KE|5.0|THIS STORY INVOLVES ALL ASPECTS OF THE LORE OF ALMOST EVERY RELGION. STORY IS FAST PACED AND VERY IMAGINATIVE. WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT IN A MOVIE.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Well I started downloading this about 2 weeks ago. Still at 52%... Not sure how to stop it so I don't continue wasting time but I sure wish I knew how...
B009YDB2QK|4.0|How is it that I have supposedly \\"purchased\\" each episode so far, yet if I accidentally click on a previously-viewed episode I'm charged again, and supposedly \\"purchase\\" it again?  I'm a big fan of Amazon in general, but this isn't going well.  Customer support!  If you give me a sausage, or explanation (look through the records) I'll support your bad-ass further.  Otherwise \\"meh\\": you're toast.  We're talking 5 bucks or so.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I found it very satisfying in the end. There were a couple of mysteries - what happened to David, why did Queenie take the blame, and what did Harold Fry do? All of these kept you reading. The larger mystery was why his marriage broke and how it was repaired.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|The title states everything. I love pigs! they are so cute! B8 &lt;-- pig in sunglasses B(:) &lt;----- another pig in sunglasses.
0375507256|5.0|I, like many other people I'm assuming, got interested in this book when I saw that they were making a movie about it. I don't usually read the book version of anything coming out in film as I'm more of a movie-goer; but the amount of content they were trying to squish into the movie had me wanting to know the story beforehand. So I claimed myself a copy and started my journey! I read through the book within a week because I just couldn't put it down and I became pretty attached to some of the characters stories and read more and more so I could get back to my favorites.  I loved how the writing style changed through the sections(?) and how they were all tied together loosely.<br /><br />I loved reading through this book and would recommend it to just about anyone... It's not the easiest read but if you really get into it, it's spectacular.
0345803485|5.0|Wow!  I went from loving that guy to hating him, to thinking maybe he wasn't so bad.  Kept me turning the pages.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|One of my favorites, I also loved book 2 but it was great how book 3 ended the story, I hope there will be more from this author!
B000002IMG|5.0|Testament's 2nd studio album \\"The New Order\\" is an absolute classic in thrash metal. It came out a little over a year after their debut \\"The Legacy\\" in 1988. Their direction changed a bit and in my opinion, it's a better album. It's a bit more melodic and complex than their first album, songwriting is better also. Musically it's more technical and the band showed a lot of maturity early in their career. If you want a more energetic and rawer album than \\"The Legacy\\" is a better choice but if you want something more technical than \\"The New Order\\" is a better choice. Production is great, not too polished but not under produced. It includes their hit \\"The New Order\\" which is a classic in thrash metal, although my personal favorites are Into The Pit, Trial By Fire and The Preacher.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Love this Game, Hours of Fun, I love it, Kids love it. Great boredom breaker on trips, doctor visits, etc.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I was impressed with all the layers to this game. I was really glad to see the different kind of puzzles within the game. I'm addicted.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|This is an amazing movie, one of the best science fiction movies of quite some time. It can be watched without any background in FireFly. I know, because that is how I originally saw it. That inspired me to watch the FireFly series and then re-watch this movie.<br /><br />There are some inside and character jokes in the movie that you just won't get if you have not seen the series, but the movie is still amazing and you will really enjoy it.<br /><br />The inside humour and character jokes are simply icing on one beautiful cake.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|There really isn't much more to say. The acting, writing, direction...all of the highest caliber. I really loved the twists this season (4) and I think I may have to break down and purchase season 5 just to find out \\"what next??!!\\"
0307960471|2.0|I have read every Jo Nesbo book that has been translated into English from HeadHunters to The Phantom. The first half of the book is top notch - then Nesbo starts to fantasize and brings poor old Harry Hole through a maze od futile actions that seems to confuse rather than deepen the plot. This seemed to start on The Leopard but has gotten worse in this book. Harry gets shot at, slashed, almost drowned but keeps on plodding - for his obsession to help someone - which becomes boring and seems mostly like a dead end futile experience. Maybe that was the author's purpose considering the end of the story.<br /><br />My reaction to the story was that I wasted a lot of my time reading it - as Harry frantically goes from depression and cynicism to uplifting hope in the flash of an eye blink and back again with another blink. The characters start to become interesting in the first half of the book and then illogically fade to oblivion in the second half.  The story became very tiresome and repetitive - I like the character of Harry Hole and was very disappointed with this book's version and the stories of the main characters - who cares about such dregs.
B004EK91LQ|1.0|Lousy acting...repetitive dance moves, story line that looks like an elementary school play written by 3rd graders!<br />Picked it up on prime while browsing through catalogue..there are definitely better dance movies
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have been playing Mystery Manor on my laptop for at least a year.  Was very happy to find I could get it on the \\"Fire\\" too.  Much more comfortable to sit in recliner and play it.  It helps to keep my powers of observation a bit sharper than they would be without it.  I am 81 years old and mostly housebound so this is one way to visit somewhere else!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game, very addicting. It downloaded perfectly. Just all around a good game. I would recimend it to anyone.
B000SW2F80|5.0|Creepshow is still a great set of stories, with enough scary to make you huddle on the couch and enough humor to keep you from being up all night.<br /><br />I watched this with my 12-year-old, who really wanted to see something by Stephen King.  Creepshow was perfect.  We loved the story that Stephen himself stars in!
B009LZEZSI|5.0|So this episode was awesome but bittersweet! You have the unraveling of many relationships on the show... But you know more good ones are going to be the product! I cried when I saw the scientist performed!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I found this novel surprisingly tough going, in view of the outstanding writing.  The problem is that there is no one to like.  I cared less and less for Jacob's defense as I read.  But I was glad I forced my way through because the unexpected ending comes with a big and memorable jolt.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I am a huge fan of Mr. DeMille's books.  I have read all of them and look forward to each new one.  This was by far the most disappointed I have ever been after reading a book.  I wanted my money back.  The story was not interesting, the majority of the text was just filler to make the book longer.  What used to be entertaining - John Corey's side comments - are now mostly annoying.  The other characters were not engaging and the plot never caught my interest.  I was sorry I wasted my time and money on this one.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille is one of my favorite authors.  Panther was a very good read, as are all John Corey novels.  Good insight into the culture of the Mid-East.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Warm, funny, touching, imaginative..fantastic...what else can I say..This is the most original movie I have watched in a while. The young actors are so real..you'll want to be where they are! Bruce Willis and Ed Norton along with the other adult stars play great characters..Watch and Enjoy!
B001AQR3E4|2.0|This review is for the quality of the Blu-ray only, and it is worthless.  Sound quality is so bad you have to turn it UP all the way to even hear the dialog.  And the movie is so dark that you can't notice any difference in the Blu-ray HD effect.  If you already have the DVD don't waste your money on the Blu-ray.  It's a joke.
B006H4DBA4|5.0|Kinsella at her very best and it was all over far too soon. More. More. More. Loved it. But what kind of name is Melchior?!
B007N8RULO|5.0|get rid of the ads and we are golden .... i like  to play anytime I have a free moment .... really good passtime game
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I found I got invested in the characters journey far more then just the attraction and sex. If you like fifty shades you'll really enjoy this!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|enjoy playing Flow Free.  have hard time putting it down! Would like to have more options with hints instead of having to buy them.
B004NSULHM|5.0|Fantastic album, in classic Radiohead fashion.  When it first came out, I was expecting another In Rainbows and thought it was garbage on first listen.  After I went through a tough break up and had a 18 hour drive from Columbus, Ohio to Winter Park, Florida to get through and I listened to it multiple times, it earned my respect and deep, heart-felt love.<br /><br />What an immense feeling of relief and letting go this album leaves with its audience.<br /><br />In Rainbows is all about the ephemeral nature of life and dying.<br /><br />In a sense (in my opinion), The King of Limbs is an album of acceptance of death, all kinds of death.  Moving on.  Et cetera.<br /><br />If you don't like it after a first listen and really enjoyed both Kid A and In Rainbows, and all of Radiohead's previous work, please give it a second chance.<br /><br />I'm telling you.  Radiohead doesn't fail to disappoint.  Except with the Daily Mail.  But that's a different story.  ha.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is wonderful for the storyline, the character and the sex. But it is so much more than the sex. You get so wrapped up in Christian and Ana.  I have read the series multiple times and am so happy that it has gotten me reading again!  So far no romance I have read compare completely!  I am grateful that they were all released when I read them so I didn't have to wait to finish the story of their lives. I just wish there was more!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|What a great box set! The perfect gift for any Indiana Jones fan. Complete films plus many,many extras. I love the \\"making of\\" documentaries included on Disc Four. Great holiday gift!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is wonderful for the storyline, the character and the sex. But it is so much more than the sex. You get so wrapped up in Christian and Ana.

B001JFZ118|4.0|Highlander was a very good movie with two good actors.  The directors cut actually turns out very good movie quality, the only darwback was a few scenes I had to turn up the volume to hear the movie.  But this movie turned me into a Highlander fan and I own this directors cut of Highlander, the directors cut of Highlander 3, and the special cut of Highlander 4: Endgame.  I am also a fan of the Highlander Series own the whole series in one box.  But what also did it for me was the beautiful shots of the country side, and the music by Queen one of favorites being \\"Who wants to live forever.\\"  So if your looking for a good action movie with some good special effects, amazing camera shots of the beautiful area the character grow up at, and the good music by a great band, then pick this movie up and enjoy a good movie with two good actors.  Lambert and Connery.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I like books and a book about books is always fun. Kinda went off on a tangent I didn't expect but I did enjoy the story. And the surprises. Now I want to look deeper into the history of printing.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Have read every book written by DeMille and this is one of the best.  Love his style....Entertaining throughout.....<br />Second only to \\"The Lion.\\"
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Saw this in theater, wanted to see it again as one seems to miss so much on the first go round. Better second time, although the small screen is no consolation!
B008OOYALE|4.0|Fun to play but need more ways to get gold and food for the dragons. Farming is expensive but you need the food. As soon as I have enough to upgrade I need more food so money goes there. It is quite fun watching the dragons though.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|The app seems fine however, it doesn't have nearly the function the website has. I would like too see the app look more like the website, giving a simpler yet more robust shopping experience. I am okay with the App its to simplified and way to clean for the advanced shopper.
1590171993|5.0|If your book discussion group likes literary fare and some of the best prose in print, they might enjoy this masterpiece by John Williams.  It is one of the best novels I have read in the past 20 years.  Although melancholy pervades its pages, Stoner, the shy but resolute English professor as the protagonist, rises above the circumstances of his situation--unfortunate marriage, antagonistic colleagues--to be excellent in his vocation. As a reward, he attracts the admiration and love of one of his graduate students.<br /><br />Stoner was probably the same age as my grandfathers.  I realized through this story that happiness was a bit elusive for that generation pinned between the two world wars and a depression with not many opportunities for advancement or success.  Hemmed in by conventionalities and duty, that generation aimed to survive. Thriving was out of reach for most of them.<br /><br />John Williams, the author of this book, taught creative writing for many years. You have to envy his students after reading this book. Our library book group loved this story and were in awe of the author's virtuosity.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is a fun game to play but it takes to long to get all the points to unlock the games.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having read a number of \\"life after life\\" books on near death experiences, I enjoyed the perspective this author brings to the subject as a brain surgeon.  I've had a number of friends and colleagues--a boss, co-worker, mother of a close friend, parent at my school where I worked--have a life after life experience so have heard these accounts in person by people whom I trust.<br /><br />If you are intrigued by how physics, metaphysics, and brain science relates to this experience, this author, as a doctor and scientist who isn't very religious, explains how they related to his 'life after life' episode. It is the first book of this type I have read which connects how quantum physics, science and spirituality mesh in this kind of experience.  I read a lot of metaphysics and some physics and always saw their significance in these near death experiences.  The experience supports quantum physics and spirituality.<br /><br />It's helpful to have the author, as a medical doctor, describe his experience and explain why, in clear scientific and medical language, he believes what he experienced can't be explained merely by neurology or medical science.  His experience gives credibility, to those with an open mind, that there is life after life.<br /><br />If you are looking for long descriptions of what happens in the after-life, you might want more.  There's enough in this book to give you glimpses of it.  There were some original insights in this book I hadn't read elsewhere.  I found this book fascinating, and especially appreciated how a scientific and medical mind reviewed the experience and the conclusions the doctor arrived at in retrospect.  It is a valuable addition to the body of work on this topic.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I love all things Jane Austen, and especially the book Persuasion.  This BBC video was very well cast.  I was disappointed, however, with the opening and ending of this movie.  To first see Anne hurrying through the house at the beginning with her lists, seemed a waste of video time. Her running so long through Bath at the ending, was also a waste, and totally out of character with Jane Austen's Anne Elliott.  If the video had followed the ending as in the novel, or had more conservation with Frederick instead,  I would have enjoyed it even more.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Entertaining, fun, a real challenge at times. Can't believe an adult can have this much fun! Recommend to anyone who likes online fun.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Sometimes it's a pain to use the Kindle's battery indicator. This app is really good at having a large-scale indicator and percentage on how much battery you have left. It gives estimated times on battery life for different uses such as Internet use or movie watching. It also comes up after full battery charge as the first app to appear so you know right off the bat how much time you have on your Kindle. I would recommend this app for a good simple battery indicator that is a bit easier to read and more detailed than the given one.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|A well-written and surprisingly humorous novel on a grand scope about the serious ideas of freedom, oppression, and Man's inhumanity to his fellow Man.  This unique circuit of stories strongly expresses the author's feelings on his issues.  Truly thought-provoking as well as entertaining for the reader.
B006RXQ800|5.0|I love the brutality of the movie.  Although obviously dramaticized, the chaos and general concepts in New York in this movie is supposed to be not too far from the truth back in those days.  Daniel Day Lewis is great as Bill the Butcher.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Robert Pattinson can act so different in all his movies.  The subject was great and all the actors did extremely well.
B000FCK42M|5.0|great read ,. very realistic. felt like i was right there. this author sure knows the ins and out of the drug cartels. eye opener
B009GN6DT4|4.0|Great movie to buy or rent and show your children the movies you saw as a child. I think it is also good for them to see older movies where children don't have video games and cell phone and they play outside.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|In my opinion, anybody that was involved in a pregnancy will really like this movie.<br />It is a great comedy, with all characters doing a great job.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This movie was not very entertaining. I would not watch this movie again. The video quality was fine. I do not recommend it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great character development as usual for Ken Follett.  The storyline kept me on the edge of my seat. Hope there is another book coming in this series!
B0018OIK0E|4.0|A great comedy/horror hybrid but was looking forward to the commentary promised on the back and it's just not there.  Just a tease I guess.
B000060O58|5.0|Brilliant! I say Pinnock and friends (Gardiner, Marriner, Herreweghe, Harnoncourt and the gang) will find it harder to play music than it is for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. Not so with Richter. A message to all \\"Historically Informed Folk\\": Grow some balls!
B007SGM084|3.0|Sorry, I know that everyone else seems to love the gratuitous sex, but I find it overboard.  I like the story line.  The writer is good but not great...tends to use the same words repeatedly.  I am enjoying the book but it's not great literature.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Loved this book.  Teaches you what is really important in life.  Just when you think you know what you are all about...life has a way of rearraging your prospective.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|reminders me of other games but this is fun.  the challenge. is good and it keeps me playong...  some stop after a few rounds but this is done by levels and is intertaining.

B0097EWK3A|3.0|was really enjoying this game until one night when I went to open it, the game crashed. it's been crashing ever since. don't want to reinstall bc I've gotten so far.
B0097VS7ZS|1.0|1. I would have apprciated the opportunity to try out the app before I ordered it.  As it is, I have no idea what I can do with it--just scribble in colors?<br />2. I would have liked to receive the app.  It is still not visible on my Kindle.
B001NTUAFC|5.0|this is an amazing tribute album that truly represents the heart of the early nineties music scene in Seattle; a scene that dominated the world.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I play chess everyday and in watching me do this my residents are learning how to play as well. LOVE THIS APP&lt;3
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Had a friend suggest this book to me. Didn't realize I was missing out on such a witty and entertaining series. Great story, funny dialogue and all around just great book. Not a hard read, but does throw out a few nice words to consider every once in a while.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is very very useful. both for students and domestic people as well as merchantised establishments. easy to handle. separate memory bar for last entered item is a plus point--rajendran for gunaseelan--
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|Purchased this for our Grandson's 7th birthday, it was on his wish list.  It was a total hit!  After his Dad put it together, he and a cousin played with it for well over 1 hour before coming out for something to eat...then back to play.  We set up the brown box it was mailed in as a target.  It's been a month since his birthday and he is still enjoy it.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|This movie was great! It had great special effects and was scary!  Colin Farrell did a great job of being truly scary and evil!  Toni Collette is always good in every thing she's in.  This movie did a great job of keeping you interested throughout and keeping the scary parts evenly dispersed!  Suspenseful, nerve-wracking and scary!  Enjoyable!  Worth seeing!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Nice app I lime the ability to use downloaded music as an alarm. I also am very pleased with the alarm that increases in volume.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read the first book in this series and enjoyed it.  I liked the characters but some of the words of the sexual exploits is a tad crued, but am looking forward though to the third installment
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I enjoyed this Cornwell book more than the last three.  It was a quick read and the story moved.  I also liked where the characters were in their lives.  There had been so much drama between them for the past few years, I had almost given up.  Thanks for reminding me of why I love Scarpetta and her twisted life!
B008C20TDG|5.0|\\"It Starts With Food\\" was the third or fourth book about the Paleo life style that I read.  While the others were interesting, it is the only one that I have recommended.  It is well written and it has definitely helped me change my life.
0399143904|5.0|This book is proof against those who argued that entertainment can only be found in the eletronic transmission. The pen is being said to have been mightier than the sword. Let me add to this dictum a little further; nothing can be afoot without outlining everything first on paper. The delight for being entertained by a book is different from the thrilling of a movie or video game. Rainbow Six has been criticised as a typical Tom Clancy book that English professors would scoff at. I beg to differ as the key to good writing is not about the coining of brilliant proverbs; Mr. Clancy was not trying to make his Rainbow troopers gun-totting poets. It takes skillful weaving to stitch together a complicated plot and still hang on solidly as one piece as a whole. Mr. Clancy certainly has a flawless gift in the interaction of his characters. It is not easy to sound natural and genuine in a profession that you are not affiliated with. In short, to sound military when you are in actuality a civilian, it certainly is challenging to come off ordinary. The author has triumphed in this. One can watch a movie and be mesmerized by its cinematic beauty, or play a video game and be ecstatic about its brilliant graphics and intensed gameplay. But all being said, reading is simply enthralling. There is absolutely no substitute, in whatever medium, for a good book. Earlier this year I had the pleasure of giving a Chuck Pfarrer book to a video game addict. He was blown away by this gift, hard cover quality and all, and gobbled up a few chapters within a night. By the time he finished reading it, he hungered for more the literature of this genre. He saw a copy of my Rainbow Six and begged for it. I refused and said that it is my bible. This novel is truly canon to its successful franchise.
0446580848|2.0|This fine writer's latest book is great - - IF you are interested in the history, culture, geography, and the miserable current state of Yemen and its similarity to so much of the Middle East- - or if you just can't get enough of John Corey's amazing one-liners and world-class quips and humorous zingers.  Those things saved a rating of TWO.<br /><br />That is the best this fan of DeMille can muster for this long-awaited latest book. It was way too long, actually often boring, almost devoid of the characteristic action of the earlier and marvelous John Corey tales.  I can't believe I actually tired of even the humor.<br /><br />Sorry to say, but just a real disappointment
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was my first exposure to Jack Reacher.  I liked his character immensely.  He is a balanced combination of manly courage,strength, and virility with believable sensitivity and compassion built in. The action is steady and engrossing.  I am now a fan and am reading the second Jack Reacer novel - Die Trying. If you haven't read Lee Child yet, I highly recommend him.  Great entertainment!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This book was a bundle of things. It was fun and entertaining but it also had hidden messages within it. Such as Sophie's situation which showed me that you are to the world what you portray or think yourself to be. Even Howl said it to her, that \\"she\\" was the one preventing herself from changing back into a girl. Aside from that, it was a refreshing story that had me laughing like a mad woman. The banter between Howl and Sophie was always funny and crazy. However, their story--to me--was jammed in the midst of a whole lot of other things, such as her sisters, the Witch of the Waste etc...and I felt like it wasn't paid close attention too like it should have been, but then again it's a youth/young adult novel. The ending I adored but wondered if there was a stronger, more definite way to finish it. Having learned of the others, I figured we're going to get the see Sophie and Howl at different times in their lives together. I really wished that there had been another book focusing mainly on the two of them, but hey, whatever doesn't happen you can always write your own...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great as always.  Looking foward to the next one.  Keep them comming. How muck more do i need to say, I like them.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. love the pictures and the story line. more entertaining than the other games like this because your actually working toward something. love it
B005O7Q6FM|4.0|I love the Castle series and have purchased the first three seasons on Amazon. I love the convenience of it. I have noticed that this season does not seem to be a true \\"HD\\". Don't know if it is just a few episodes or the whole thing.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The cross fire series is a wicked good read.  While it's similar to the 50 Shades series in the subject matter, Ms. Day does a great job developing the main characters as they struggle to come to terms with the past events that have shaped their lives and have brought them together. Titilating love scenes certainly add to the flavor!  I cant wait for the next book!
B0010SKSTO|5.0|Great reference book. Could not put down. Was ver informative. Written in a very understandable format. You will get your money's worth and souchmore!
B0094OLFUW|2.0|I'm not sure if it's just too quite or too simple or if there's not enough of a pop influence but this album is really boring.  Seriously, don't bother
B002BI6SMI|4.0|A gripping thriller that works better than its successful sequel and cements star Liam Neeson firmly into the action-thriller genre.
B008846SVA|5.0|Sean  liked this book because it was about knickers. It was very silly. He wants to give the book 5 stars.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i<br />I love this game, it reminds me of Mario, soooo fun and soooo many levels!! I recommend to anyone! Very good game and time waster!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|The movie was very good. I really enjoyed it. Enjoy Johnny Depp playing the role he is good at playing which is eccentric.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I know this is not suposed to be minecraft but this is plain crap. go waste your money somewhere else. its really hard to navigate and walk around and what's up with all the guys named ted! DONT BUY THIS APP!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This has been the best Mahjong game I have downloaded so far.  It is complicated enough to keep your interest, especially when you are trying to beat your best time.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Best season out of all ten. Worth the wait of you quit watching before you should have and captivating story line that warrants more than just one viewing. Worth the purchase!
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I enjoyed the book but it wasn't a what is called a spell binder. But then again I am a middle aged Pollyanna fan. It was nice to have a ending!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Sweat like a mother. Easy to get into the habit of doing and you can turn her commentary off which is nice. Haven't shed a pound but I do shred inches because you can see muscle toning. Worth the time and money if you're willing to put the 27 minutes in per day
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I saw the author on a morning news program and decided to give him a try. Once I began reading I could hardly put the book down. The story was excellent and the characters were well defined. I have already begun reading the second book in the John Corey series, The Lions Game, and it too is has me mesmerized.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|this app is not very good at all. Fast download waste of time. this is probably the most boring game i have ever played. its right about the pretend part. you can crack the same wifi five times and its a different glob of gibberish each time. I mean come on people do you really think that they would put out a free app on an open market? for free? they would get sued with out a doubt.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|It was just okay.  I guess I would have liked it more had it been advertised as a prequel but maybe not even then.  Wasn't impressed.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|If you love Tim Burton, this film lives up to his kooky way of looking at things. Great cast and visuals.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Have been a Scarpetta fan from day one, so was excited to get this book immediately. Unfortunately I found it dull and predictable. The characters were one dimensional and just going through the motions. The story was choppy and boring. So sorry for fans.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This is the cutest movie... My kids have watched all the Tinkerbell movies and this is by far the best!!  I loved it too!!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Enjoyed this movie. I recommend it if you like superheroes. Currently waiting for Batman / Dark Knight trilogy. I will watch it again.
B008GOG98Y|5.0|Too bad there aren't ten stars to display.  This is one of the best movies my husband and I ever saw.  It's a great coming of age movie.It's funny, sad, inspiring...great casting and excellent acting.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|The Reacher series provides excellent &#34;airport novels&#34;. Fast moving, easy reading, compelling characters, and a mysterious plot to surprises you in the end. I do not understand why these have not yet become movies. They are written like they could be exciting thrillers.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|the movie was in the mail quick, ordering was fast & easy and it was in great shape, as expected!
B008BDZP30|5.0|Chunga's Revenge ushers in the controversial \\"Flo and Eddie\\" era of Zappa's catalog, and while albums from this period have their detractors, \\"Chunga's\\" is a tasty slice of surprisingly ferocious, unpretentious rock, programmed next to some fantastic instrumental pieces (\\"Twenty Small Cigars,\\" the title track) and the lengthy \\"The Nancy and Mary Music.\\" The vocal songs, meanwhile, are not nearly as bawdy as on the later live releases from this incarnation of the group, and display both a conciseness and a melodicism that Zappa would embrace only sporadically after the notorious incident at the Rainbow Theater (and, as an aside: it's striking to note how different Zappa's voice was before the accident. This Zappa could not have pulled off the style he would later adopt on \\"Apostrophe\\" and other albums). In sum, \\"Chunga's Revenge\\" is an underrated work that serves as a great overview of the Flo and Eddie period's oft-underappreciated charms.<br /><br />Previous CDs of \\"Chunga's\\" used a digital master that Zappa prepared in 1989/1990, and which suffered from an overuse of bad compression, dropouts, and a wash of digital effects (mostly reverberation) that made the entire album sound like it was recorded in a cave with really poor acoustics. UMe's 2012 reissue is nothing short of miraculous, returning to the original analog master and, like many of the other Zappa reissues, presenting the album without any of Zappa's ill-advised modifications. It now sounds pretty much like it sounded on vinyl: dry and inviting. The lack of reverb also ensures that \\"Tell Me You Love Me\\" rocks at least 10% more.<br /><br />Verdict: Do you like \\"Chunga's?\\" Own an earlier CD? Buy this one and get rid of your old CD. Leery of the Flo and Eddie era? This is a wonderful place to start.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it does what I need it to do. clear and easy to see.  its a calculator. not much more I can say.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a book that held your attention thoughout the whole book and could see how these things could happen. Good writer as he went back and forth to explain the past and how it effected the future.It was hard to put down.
B009JNXK88|3.0|The game is not terrible or anything but after playing for a half an hour I realized it wasn't getting any better.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|The headline says it all.  Ultraviolet is just a waste of people's time.  In a couple more years, the entire program will collapse.<br /><br />Filmmakers for the studios go to great lengths to make sure they make movies for the widest possible audience.  So then why do the studio executives go to great lengths to limit their audience?  They choose to endorse Ultraviolet - and not just endorse it, but actively ignore iTunes, the platform that most people use - for their digital movies.<br /><br />If you are going to offer Ultraviolet, they need to at least offer a real digital download via iTunes as well.  But just offering one and not the other is just the executives at the studios proving how out of touch with reality they are, and how little they deserve to have their jobs.<br /><br />As far as the movie itself, I think it was the weakest of the Nolan Batman movies, but still a good movie.  The last hour was two different third acts for two different movies, it seemed, and cut the flow and resolution of the movie.  The Libertarian politics were very, very apparent but it is hard to criticize it's brutal truths and logic, though it is easy to complain about the same... which is one of the points Nolan was trying to make.
B007IGG0IA|4.0|This is a good cd if you are into this band, i would recomend checking out \\"ceromonies\\" as part of this bands appeal to me is the unique sound, and many of the popular songs that the casual listener hears on the radio sound much different than the versions that you might be familar with, however, stand alone or for a fan of the band a great cd.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a very basic, easy to read accounting of the operation to hunt down OBL.  With all the years of training, dedication, and hard work from elite SEALs to desk bound intelligence analysts, it was frustrating to see this operation nearly collapse on itself before it achieved its final objective.  The accounting needed to include pictures of OBL.  If the American citizenry can have hours and hours of videos and thousands of pictures of OUR people killed by that terrorist, then we have the right to see his death mask.<br /><br />Good book worth the read.  The author's adult life re-invigorated my belief that America can and will overcome the deep problems from the past 5 years.<br /><br />God bless all who serve this country in uniform.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Worked fantastically, used it to re-paste 3 gaming laptops dropped cpu and gpu temps over 10 degrees at full load. Have used Arctic products for years and have never been disappointed regardless of which type you buy it's easy to apply and ranks top 5 in every comparison I've seen and generally ranks top 3.
1451627297|5.0|This is the first and only Stephen King book I have read and I loved it from start to finish! I read the book in less than 2 days and was totally absorbed by the story! I love time travel novels and this one is the best I have ever read.
B008RZF2I0|3.0|Kamelot's \\"Silverthorn\\" is a largely successful effort that unfortunately, despite all the potential in the world fails to rise above their last effort \\"Poetry for the Poisoned\\".<br /><br />Newcomer Tommy Karevik does a wonderful job with impressive vocals from low alto to sweeping highs that contend with some of former frontman Roy Khan's best performances. The new singer is not the problem with this album.<br /><br />With a focus on guest appearances and perhaps without the aid of song co-writer Roy Khan the songs feel piecemeal and are somewhat generic and generally uninteresting. Gone are the sweeping melodies from \\"The Black Halo\\" and gone are the powerful duets found in \\"Poetry for the Poisoned\\". Songs blend together from first to last and few tracks stand out to even the most ardent Kamelot fan.<br /><br />What's next for Kamelot? As fans we can hope for a long hiatus from album production. Much like Nightwish's last two albums, \\"Silverthorn\\" feels rushed and not enough training and input from the new singer was allotted for. 2-3 years of touring, songwriting, ideas, creativity and training could almost certainly produce a new cornerstone album from metal giant Kamelot.<br /><br />The future with Kamelot seems to be certain, albeit uneasy for their fans as we wait to see if this album indicates a tonal shift in their production design, or simply a transitional hiccup to a new singer. For a band that has produced what many consider to be metal masterpieces, Kamelot has many hard years ahead of it to ensure fans they are still a top contender.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Awesome Season.  Worth the money. This show never disappoints me! Intense up until the last minute! I love amazon instant video!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was well written and an easy read.I read several reviews and I did want to note that this book is not appropriate for kids in their early teen years.  The subject of sex, incest, child abuse, homosexuality,drug use, etc are so prevalent in this book.  Wait until 15 to 16 to read this.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Another good read from Lee Child.  I have been reading the Jack Reacher novels almost from the first and always look forward to the new ones.  One of the things I enjoy about Lee Child's style in this series; is that he does NOT retell the last book in the current one.  Seems like he gives us credit to keep up or get caught up.  I like that.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|of the old plot; close a lot of questions of the saga and open a lots too..had to be very alert because is a lot of information threw at you..
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I found this movie very refreshing and light hearted.It made you feel like you were part of the adventure. I recommended this movie to my grandchildren.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|This movie deserves the high critcal aclaim that it's received.  Everything about it is top drawer.  The movie is very intense and a bit dark, so be prepared.
B009GEEMLY|2.0|SO DUMB, yes I get it's a comic book movie, and I get the fantasy aspect of it, the problem is the acting, it is among the most contrived and forced performances I have ever seen. So bad, so so bad. Thor is horrible, Captain America even worse, Iron Man acceptable, only character worth a crap is Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, and he even struggles, some of these guys are great actor, yet they seem like they are cringing at their own words, as if they can not believe they are being forced to say this awful dialogue. Action and FX are great of course, but at two and half hours it is torture to sit through the other crap.
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|Man, I thought the Strange Sensation DVD was untouchable, but Plant's innovation and creativity pushed the boundaries of BoJ on this DVD. Wow.  Buddy Miller is off-the-hook, the rythym section rumbles and rolls, and my favorite surprise was watching how unbelievable Darrel Scott is. Wish he was in my band. If you like Robert, buy it. If you're a musician, regardless of genre, buy it and learn.
B008OOYALE|5.0|cute and fun little pet game. I have really enjoyed playing this so far. plus dragons are awesome. stupid word minimum for comments.
1609611543|5.0|Good stuff in this book.  Still reading it, can't wait to put it into practice.  It's amazing that I keep finding out that I don't know what I don't know.  Keep up the good work.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Excellent book; one of his best in my opinion.  Not only was the story entertaining, it was also very informative regarding Yemen, the culture and the strife the country has endured.  Highly recommend it !
B0018LMZO4|5.0|I have been a keen fan ever since \\" Days Of Future Passed \\", and ever since could not get enough of their unique style of the soft and beautiful music that got me through the late sixties and the early to mid seventies, and on up to the mid eigthies.<br />Now to hear all of those fantastic tunes on remastered digital CD; I say, bring it on and on.<br />Two thumbs up for this mammoth effort; and I get to listen to all this whenever I like; and the same is to be said for all the other 'Moody ' albums being remastered.
0307200477|5.0|This was one of my daughter's favorite books. I purchased the deluxe version and was pleased to see it was a larger book with bigger print. A must have in any child's library.
B006LSZECO|5.0|We're reading this book for our book club and I liked it better than any of the books we've read in the last 2 years.  I have to say, the author had me going until the half-way point in the book!  Very intriguing,  well-written, and best of all, the author has an amazing sense for relationships.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|As a long-time fan of Michael Crichton, I was excited to read this book. I found the science satisfactory but the characters were just not up to snuff in this one. The lack of character development made the actions of the villain a little ridiculous. I was left with a feeling of disappointment from what could have been an imminently plausible novel involving nano-technology.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great, fun movie for the whole family.  The 3D was great, lots of moments where you felt you could just touch the items on the screen.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|This is a kick off your shoes, loosen your belt, turn off your mind and have fun movie.<br />If you turn finding historical inaccurate items into a drinking game, I doubt you will be able to see the wall much less the TV after 30 minutes.<br />Vampires are real in 19th century America.  They tolerate sunlight and dominate the southern states.<br />As a boy, Lincoln sees one kill his mother.  An adult Lincoln bent on revenge is building courage in a bar.<br />A stranger speaks to him, saves his life on a botched kill and teaches him how to be a \\"vampire slayer\\".<br />The result is some astounding fights, excellent special effects and deeds of derring-do.<br />The finial is a train fight on the way to Gettysburg that might be worth the price of admission.<br />The acting works for the move.  Most journeymen actors and the script is careful not to test their talents to much.<br />If you want a fun movie requiring no thought, this is a good choice.
B009JNXK88|5.0|It's a MegaMan-esque platform game, but with the earn stars for better times mechanic of some of the most popular mobile games. Lots of fun to be had!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|There was good momentum throughout. The action and humor were well balanced. I absolutely loved Ruffalo's take on the Hulk.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The wife and I ended up looking up everything about Prometheus afterwards because we were so captivated by the tie in's with Alien, etc... Good movie, especially for those who align with Sci-Fi.
B008OOYALE|3.0|i love dragons and i was super pumped when dragon story cam out but it is pretty slow so i usually don't visit my friends that often, bakery story is faster
B004PIA4BI|5.0|Battery arrived promptly and works great! Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter explained the premise of the series and I had to be convinced to read it.  It sounded too \\"out there\\" for my taste.  I'm so happy I did read them it expanded my horizons and I voraciously tore through them wondering what would happen next.  I wish there would be a follow up series.  Totallenjoyed all three books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Interesting and wonderfully different. I thought the second book couldn't be as good as the first, but was happily surprised to find it was.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I hated to pay this much for a book because you never know if you will like it or not. You really never know with the reviews you read because they are up and down, but this book was worth every penny!!! I couldn't put it down...wonderful wonderful book! Highly recommended!
B009M51ZLW|5.0|New cd by the lead singer of Propaganda and Act.  It is an album of covers including songs by Pet Shop Boys, David Bowie, ELO etc.  The music is fantasticly beautiful.  It takes you away.  Produced by Stephen Hague who produxced albums for Bronski Beat, Pet Shop Boys, etc.  does a wonderful job on making this album a joy to listen too.  Best song - King's Cross (Pet Shop Boys).
B007M45PMU|5.0|The song Ho Hey drew me in first bit this whole album is great. Paste put out Dead Sea on one of their mix tapes. We went to see them at ACL and the show was more packed than I could believe. Get the album now. These guys are blowing up.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book. Could not put it down. All 800 + pages.  Constantly keeps you on edge wanting to find out more. Read it.
B005PMNBNG|5.0|Underrated band that deserves to be heard. Buy this album, you won't be disappointed...... Takes you into a musical paradise
B009HEON7G|2.0|Overall not a bad zombie movie, not a big budget but they did well with what they had. As far as zombie movies go, it worth the viewing as long as your not expecting a movie the caliber of Dawn of the Dead.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|Great film, takes me back to my early days, nostalgic<br />childhood, friendly aliens, and friendly neighborhoods, great<br />to see actors in their youth. and just plain love the story!
B003YU2HSQ|4.0|Overall a good movie.  I have watched it more than once.  Couple things that aren't very believable, but that kinda makes it fun.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Supernatural just gets keep getting better and better. I have watched from the very beginning and have re-watched seaons again and again. Stories are fantastic, funny, touching, and of course scary. Love this season! I love the extras, especially the gag reel which I watch first! Can't wait for Season 8 to come out on DVD!
0596007124|4.0|I have this book and the \\"Gang of Four\\" ([[ASIN:0201633612 Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]]) and this one is definitely more enjoyable to read.  The examples are presented with real-life scenarios that are easy to understand.  The GoF book is more of a dry textbook, and probably makes a better reference to go back to after studying.  The Head First series has a much better flow without being too fluffy.  The examples build on each other and make sense for the most part, but sometimes they try to model more familiar non-programming scenarios (e.g. remote control, waitress) rather than programs that you would normally see these patterns being used in.  That makes it easier to understand, but harder to put to good use.  Still, a good book.
B00846REIS|2.0|I realized immediately that this book is a copy cat of FSOG more or less. I read it all the way through and parts of it I liked and parts of it I didn't like and by the time I finished it, I decided that I will not be reading the rest of this series. I can't recommend this book to others.
B008M34INW|2.0|This movie would have been better if you could easily read the subtitles. If we weren't are on top of the TV, we couldn't see what the characters were saying.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed this story. I did pick up on parts where I could tell that the book was not written by an American but otherwise, I was caught up in the story. I did find it hard to read about the abuse angle but I did enjoy the humour that was injected throughout the book. If you don't mind kinky sex and adult language and situations, then give this story a try. It is a good romance story.
B004ZZFMTK|5.0|Julia Child is great!  She goes into great detail, and covers many recipes that I have not even tried before.  So far all the recipes I have tried have been GREAT!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This story was so exciting I could hardly put my Kindle down and spent most of a sleepless night reading it.  It demonstrates very well the challenges our military, intelligence and State Department must deal with.  Why do they volunteer to live these difficult dangerous careers?  As a military wife for 27 years, I have no doubt that the bottom line is love of country and family.  Some civilians find patriotism hard to understand, and some even consider it a dirty word.  John Corey, the leading character in the novel, manages to be patriotic, intelligent and capable, all the while making hilarious witty remarks while he is in very dangerous scary situations.  I was left wondering why Nelson DeMille dislikes the CIA so much he makes the CIA a villain in his stories?
B009NQKXYK|2.0|A spaceship of supposedly intelligent people making stupid decision and wind up getting dead -- makes for a boring couple of hours.  This film had none of the tension, mood, and grit of Scott's Alien.  At the end, you're left wondering what it was about and if there was a point to the whole thing. There are several unresolved plot points as well.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|The story line was good.  I thought the characters were were too convenient in that it would be hard to imagine each interacting through the story impacting with one another.  Trite and predictable would be a good summary.  Having said all that I will still probably read book two.
B001OKCPI0|4.0|Ghost Ship is a classic ghost story at sea, despite being a bit gory. It's got a great cast, a solid plot, and some spooky ghosts!
B002NOH7G6|4.0|If you want a comic book style, action packed, gory version of the Spartans fighting the Persians at Thermopylae, then this is the movie for you.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I would read the sequence, bit I couldn't get into the characters. They didn't leave wih any emotions.
B009SJ3LHI|4.0|Unlike the Green Arrow in \\"Smallville\\" this one will kill the bad guys. I never liked the comic book Green Arrow but this one I do enjoy watching as long as they don't start watering it down.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson Demille has done it again. Action from start to finish. John Coreys ongoing smart alleck coments provide ongoing humor.I look forward to his next book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games do not build up enough points to advance easily once the games in one area are completed so you have to replay until points will open the next game...some of the games are fun but some are very boring.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|Don't be put off by the fact that this film is in Black & White. It is a simply brilliant movie about Nuclear War and the stupidity and selfishness of our politicians and senior military. Peter Sellers is at the top of his game as the titular Doctor, the US President and the RAF Captain Mandrake and both George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are standouts as a nutty General and an even crazier Brigadier respectively. Absolutely hilarious, with some of the most surreal dialogue ever (\\"You can't fight in here: this is the War Room!\\"). You would be crazy to miss this - the funniest film ever about a really serious subject.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Wes Anderson has a great sense of place and humor. His characters are at best described as \\"quirky\\" which adds to the fun. That said while his movies are memorable you have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy them. There is a lot of nuance and subtlety that can be hard to appreciate when you are watching a movie at home and are tempted to do something else in front of the TV. But if you can make a quiet space for yourself this movie with reward you.
B009OYTIXS|5.0|The TV version follows the Green Arrow comic book story line fairly well.  I find Arrow has just enough plot and twists to keep me intruiged and the lead character, while predictably handsome and mysterious, is well done.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|First of all I really like the match 3 type games. This game has great visuals and the music is nice and soothing. Now the bad parts. As you progress through the game the levels get more difficult as you might expect. The problem is the time limit for solving the level is very short on some levels. I wish they would add a \\"Casual\\" mode without the timer so that you can solve the level at your leisure.
B009QW7HMC|4.0|When will the next episode be available on Amazon. It's the number one show purchased on Amazon, just thought the uploads would be faster because I know people are just waiting to buy it. Thought this episode ended with a lot of questions, could have been summarized instead of the entire episode. I don't know if they should leave just yet. Andrea should tread softly because the governor does not seem tolerant and she's asking prying questions. Still interesting just want to see what happens next.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|A Feast for Crows is the forth book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, and I can't get enough of this series, more great story lines where you finally find out what happens to some of the main characters such as Bran and Catelyn. Another unputdownable book from George R R Martin
B009NPKTN6|5.0|This is one of the best musicals I've seen! Very excellent parody of 80's rock!! I'm glad I finally got to see it...
B007V65R54|5.0|In a single word \\"OUTSTANDING\\"! Nate Silver makes polls understandable and truly show what effect the noise introduces. Highly recommended a must read for political junkies.
B000FC1192|5.0|I admit, I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan, and I have yet to read a bad Gaiman novel, so there is my disclaimer right off the bat.  This story is a real gem, because it is short but rich in story and detail.  Neil says in his forward that he literally cut nothing from this book because he wrote it a little at a time over a long period of time, and he picked his words so deliberately that when the book was published there was very little editing.  This amazes me, that he would write such a great novel in its raw form; thus proving that he is one of the best writers out there today. I'm not going to bother with a synopsis, because most people have seen the movie, which is very similar to the book. I will say however, that I feel the book does a few things that the movie does not.  One is it has a much eerier feel than the movie.  Even though Neil wrote this for his 6 year old daughter, doesn't mean its low key.  This won't be like many of the childhood novels that most people grew up reading.  There are parts in this book that are very disturbing, if not down right scary.  That being said, Gaiman masterfully tempers his shock with sugar, providing enough light moments, humor, and fun to keep the children and adults reading this novel captivated and entertained.  This book probably has the best mix of fun and scare that I have seen in a novel.  This is not Gaiman's greatest novel by far, but it is probably his most popular and accessible because of its length and theme.  I have personally read this novel 4 times now, and it never ceases to entertain me.  I can't say that about most novels.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I only read about 1/8th of the book because i had absolutely nothing better to do. Dissapointing after reading all the harry potter books and being absolutely hooked by them
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book is very engaging and easy to read. I'm a fan of the series and wanted to read the books to see what didn't make it into the show.
B000SOSS5W|4.0|Dexter Gordon was fantastic, brought tears to my eyes. I loved every thing about it. I will never get tired of watching it.
B0094WK9EC|5.0|This is my first Swedish House Mafia cd and it's amazing! Perfect driving music, or music you can use to pump you up for workouts or if you play sports. I wish I can see them live!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app,  its very neat and organized it works profitently and hope it works great for you.Thank you for your consideration.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|My favorite feature is the ability to make the snooze button cover most of the screen, while the &quot;disable&quot; button is very small. This way I can blindly hit snooze to get the alarm to shut up, but unless I am actually awake enough to touch the disable button it will come again to get me up and moving. :-) The native Motorola RAZR ics alarm clock has the button sizes reversed and I overslept several times because I thought I had touched snooze. I also use it as a timer when I'm cooking, it's handy since the phone stays close to me rather than having a timer go off in the kitchen when I'm somewhere out of earshot. Love this app.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a fun app but it has poor controls and ridiculuous games. other than that it presents a good challenge. it is alsoa good time waster.
B00470TOV0|5.0|Really like this movie, always a classic. I love that I can get this movie through amazon instant video now.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was a thrilling story.  I read it so fast (within two days on my kindle). You have to get this book if you are into the series.  I swear you will not regret it.
B007R41E8O|4.0|ive really enjoyed the game so far although there have been a few times I want to bang my head against the wall since its very challenging. I like that though as a lot of these hidden object games can be way too easy.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like playing on my phone and kindle but I am not able to add bingo buddies and Facebook shows I have request that I cannot accept.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I was a little apprehensive getting this game as it was never a favorite of mine at fairs and such but its strangely addicting. I find myself cheering and hoping in different parts of the game. I read some reviewers that said they cant get more coins and that's just not true. they rack up as you're playing every 30 seconds and every 20 mins when you're not. I still haven't figured out hoe to get the prizes that dropped in the gutter but some reviewers say its possible so ill just keep trying :-) the fact that this game is completely free just makes it all the better!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I figured out what had happened about 3/4 thru, however it was still very good.  I read war brides right before this one so I was ready to read another book about the bravery of the WW2 people...
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very clearly written and excellent directions for anyone. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to publish their book through Kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ive been waiting for this game for so long ive been playing all day and decided to make this review
0307346617|5.0|This book is really great. It has a simple back-story, after a zombie pandemic (World War Z) the world comes to the brink of extinction but, out of the fire the world prevails (barely). And a man who wants to bring the real story's of the war to the public without biased government reports takes it into his his own hands and interviews real people who fought against the undead. He interviews doctors who saw the first cases in remote towns to soldiers who fought in historic battles against the undead. Some of their story's are sad and heart wrenching while others are terrifying while others are of some random smuggler or some third-world country's grunt soldiers story of a horrific battle seen he and his squad stumble upon. I don't want to give away too much so I'll let you read the book and judge it for yourself all I have to say is this is a great book and I highly recommend you read this.....now!!! Also there is a movie coming out for this book if you didn't know already so if you read this book you will probably get some insight into the movie.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|It came really fast(2 Days Later). The Blu-ray & DVD were in flawless condition, looks like it may have been watched once, the case and cover were in good condition, too. And Thor was a Perfect Movie I think. No complaints here.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Surprisingly fun game. Even though there is a cash shop available, I never feel pressured to buy anything because most items are obtainable over time by just playing the game. The art is super cute and colorful. I run this game several times a day just to check on my dragons and collect my coins. Addicting!
B00913DPW2|5.0|I never write reviews but this game is worth a couple of minutes of my time. Its a must to have. Loads of entertainment and will keep you thinking constantly. I like a challenge and this game provides it and more. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Author Patricia Cornwell is a writing machine. Each year in late October, she puts out another Dr. Kay Scarpetta medical/crime/thriller, as routine as post-Halloween candy sales and pre-Christmas wish lists.<br /><br />\\"Bone Bed,\\" the 20th in the Scarpetta series, immediately hit bestseller lists. An added bonus this year is that the novel is good, really good, and not just a product of hype and publicity. Having strayed a bit in past novels, Cornwell has returned to what readers most enjoy - characters who are vulnerable and forensics and crimes that.<br /><br />For those who don't know, Scarpetta is a chief medical examiner with state and federal military jurisdiction. Her inner circle includes a FBI profiler for a husband (Benton), a rogue computer genius for a niece (Lucy) and an unpredictable ex-cop for a friend (Marino). Cornwell draws on her personal background, including stints as a computer analyst in the Virginia chief medical examiner's office and as a police reporter for a major newspaper. She flies helicopters and drives fast vehicles (like niece Lucy), is intrigued by serial killers (like Jack the Ripper) and (like a Bone Bed victim) recently went on a dinosaur dig where discovered a tooth fossil estimated to be 70 million years old.<br /><br />When Scarpetta receives a video and a pictured of a detached ear, she deduces that they may have something to do with a paleontologist who went missing during a dinosaur dig in Canada. The mystery has to be put on the back burner at the Cambridge Forensic Center, Scarpetta's high-tech playground, as dead bodies arrive at the Boston facility under very unusual circumstances.<br /><br />An unidentified woman's body tangled in fishing lines ensnaring an ancient leatherneck turtle raises speculation that she might be a billionaire's missing wife. On trial for hiring his wife's murder, although a body have yet to be found, tries deflecting attention by discrediting Scarpetta.<br />Like a carefully constructed stringof dominoes, pieces begin to fall into place as more seemingly unrelated deaths are methodically and scientifically tied together.<br /><br />Figuring out who is the behind the crimes is only a part of the \\"Bone Bed\\" story. The tougher-than-bricks Scarpetta faces an even bigger personal dilemma - not a whodunit, but more of a \\"who are they\\" mystery. What secrets are those closest to her keeping? Are they who she's always believed them to be, or has she let herself become blind to the truth?<br /><br />\\"Bone Bed\\" reads like classic Cornwell, putting the main characters up front with naked emotion. It's the struggle of personal strength vs. weakness that readers most relate to, the feeling that crime-solving heroes can be thin-skinned human, too. While Cornwell consistently delivers in the outstanding forensic technology arena, she's come up short on characterization in her last few novels by creating plots that lack emotional depth. Cornwell now is back to the basics that have attracted millions of readers for many years - characters that are as intriguing as the high-tech arena that surrounds them.<br /><br />Patricia Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta, welcome home
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This is book is about 4 girls who lose their best friend. They were all best friends with Ali. Hanna has become a stuck up drama queen who shop lifts. Aria has just moved back from Iceland and dates her English teacher. Emily finds out that she's gay and doesn't want to swim. And Spencer is the same old Spencer. Always trying to be better than her older sister Melissa always stealing her boy friends. When the police find Ali's body the girls reunite and yeah that's pretty much it.
B005IEGUDY|4.0|Long, but an easy read!  More like a collection of stories than a novel. Very interesting- brings history to life
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This is a very interesting read by Mitch Albom. I think this was a very touching and moving novel. How much do we cherish our time? This book will make you think of that!!
031620157X|4.0|I have to admit that I am a big Glee fan (Klaine forever!) and I also absolutely adore fairy tale retellings. I am always leary of books written by singers and actors but I found myself immediately sucked into the Land of Stories and I forgot completely about who the author was.  I'd say this book is perfect for 9-12 year olds or those in about that reading range.  The Land of Spells is a fantastic imaginary world and I loved every time the young brother and sister stumbled upon a famous fairy tale character.  Especially delightful was the reimagined Little Red Riding Hood and the mother to be Cinderella.  Colfer took the characters you thought you knew by now and twisted them around just a little bit.  There is an actual plot to this tale as the siblings who fell into this world want only to get back home again where their widowed mother must be worried sick to death about their disappearance.  The kids decide to embark on a scavenger hunt to find items for the Wishing Spell, a spell so powerful it can grant ANY wish.  The story was somewhat predictible but I admit to being thrown a curveball or two I didn't see coming.  The one negative is that I really feel like these two siblings could have been written with more character and personality but in traditional fairy tales, how often has that ever happened?  This book comes highly recommended although older readers may not find it nearly as magically entertaining as their younger counterparts.  I am interested to see what Colfer will bring next to the table.
B004LWZW6U|5.0|David Koechner (Anchorman's Mr. \\"Whammy!\\"), Gary Busey, David Hasselhoff and Christopher Lloyd making a cheesey guts and goodies movie! What's not to like? Yes, it is as bad as it sounds and that's why it's awesome. If you're looking for a less expensive disc to try out on your new 3D flatscreen and have a sense of humor give it a try. CGI visceral fleshing eating fish jumping out of the screen accompanied by terrible acting is always fun in the old traditional B movie style that is meant to be.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love this CD. I have listened to it over and over again. The music and lyrics beautiful. I cannot say enough good things about it.
B004X75RK4|5.0|I loved this movie. It made me laugh alot, it made me cry and it was just a very good feel good movie. Great plot, great acting, lots of fun.
B000BNI90O|5.0|The score is absolutely incredible. Throughout the 80+ themes in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, most of them make their debut here. So if you're an avid film score collector like me, buy it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great book. Already read girl with a dragon tatoo. The locales are ones I'm not familiar with but that must be true of most of the humans who currently inhabit the earth. Slow to get into but the characters keep you interested.
0316098515|5.0|Really good cookbook, great recipes, photos and easy to understand. :) Its a must buy if your a chef looking for ideas or a love for fine food.
B009JNXK88|5.0|The comparisons of this game to Super Meat Boy are very fitting, especially with the ghost option and instant restart option turned on. The touch controls are good on my phone. I like the graphical style too. Top notch game.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|If they had spent a little less time on monsters (believe it or not) and a little more time on the Engineers, it would have been more interesting.
B000002GOZ|5.0|This is one of the best live and unplugged CDs I've ever listened to. Thanks so much for having it in stock and available
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I have been reading Pat Cornwell's books about Kay Scarpetta for about 20 years, but have found it disturbing to have her becoming<br />more and more paranoid in her interactions with the individuals in her world.  The books are less and less enjoyable.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Great show! The writing is great. The show was created for people who don't want something intense. My wife and I love this show.
B0012GTZC0|3.0|\\"Eye of the Needle\\" is a typically engaging Follett work.  It has a good story line with interesting characters and seems to be historically accurate.
B001TH16DI|3.0|i orderd myself the blu ray disc STAR TREK ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE COLLECTION INCLUDING SIX THEATRICAL FILMS PLUS A SEVENTH BONUS DISC  THE CAPTAINS SUMMIT. THIS PACKAGE IS MISSING STARTREK  THE MOTION PICTURE#1 AND HAS TWO COPYS OF THE FINAL FRONTIER. THIS SEEMS TO BE A NICE SET OF MOVIES I JUST WISH THAT I HAD THEM ALL
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Fans of the first season: this is a must watch! I am anticipating much more intrigue as the season progresses.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|This album is a great album, considering their last album was  essentially a live album that consisted of mainly older songs and only a few new songs. So I was very happy to see that this album was a completely new one. An a slightly new sound, but while also still sticking to the distinctive sound that papa roach is known for. I give the album 10 out of 10. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
0385535147|2.0|This is the first book of his I have read that I thought \\"maybe he owed his publisher a book for late 2013\\" and \\"maybe he hired someone else to write it\\".<br />It was really not very good.<br />I hate a susoense thriller where the author throws you the answer to the whole story in the last 2-3 chapters by introducing a brand new element or character, and that now explains the reason for all of what you have been reading up until now......... really very weak.<br />In his Acknowledgements he tells us that this is his first book done with virtually no research, and almost none of the story had facts whihc were developed from real life events or locations. Well thanks for letting us know you didn't lose any time to research, but it became pretty obvious about a 1/4 way into the book...... OK. a little earlier than that.<br /><br />TC
B008XG1X18|4.0|i love to use this app on my kindle fire! its pretty easy to use and I love the view of the pics. i prefer viewing pinterest on my kindle verses my iohone. great app keep up the good work guys!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This second book of the Crossfire series was as good, if not better, than the first!  I absolutely fell in love with the characters in this book!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I've been reading the Scarpetta series since the beginning.  It's always been my favorite series to read and this one doesn't disappoint.  I will be sad the day Patricia Cornwell hangs up the towel on Kay.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love Nelson DeMilles John Corey novels.  They are long, researched, detailed and always a damned good story.  I  particularily liked all the history that the reader is given privy too throughout the story.  The endings though - always predictable because John always gets his man.  A great read.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I really enjoyed the first book of Stieg Larsson's trilogy, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  It was very exciting and one of the kind of books that is hard to put down.  I am now on the second one and hopefully will enjoy it as much as I did the first.  Lisabeth is a very complex, interesting  and talented person and I am very intrigued with here relationship with Blomkvist. I do hope it heats up again in the second book.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I did not plan on reading the series and after many people I know read them and said they were good, I thought I would try. I was so disappointed! There is no actual plot .... I would consider them just a new age \\"Harlequin\\" book with a lot of sex. Don't bother!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Love every one of Jo Nesbo's books.  This one is great.  Terrfic ending.  Glad Harry Hole was not drunk the whole book.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Excellent, intelligent lyrics with a great sound.  We are all lucky he was rediscovered.  A great talent.  Hopefully more original music will be coming.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Enjoyed the whole 8 season series.  It WAS odd the number of cases that featured seizures of one sort or another, but I suppose that's where the drama lies.  Still, the shows were entertaining and Hugh Laurie made a major leap from playing Bertie Wooster.  He's quite a fine actor.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was awsome I love the Percy Jackson books, have yet to read the rest, I also love how you portrayed the gods how you modernized them.
1423140605|5.0|this was a gift for a friend and she seems to really enjoy it. i have no idea what the story is about but it was shipped fast and packaged nicely. it was hard bound i believe and from what the jason bourne movies have taught me, it would also make a great defensive weapon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Be prepared to put aside whatever else you have to do when you pick up this book.  This well-written page turner keeps you hooked throughout the reading, and pondering the conculsion for weeks after you read the last page.  A great read that left me wanting to read more books by this author, and the electronic edition let me do just that with samples of two other Gillian Flynn books incuded. You will recommend this book to your friends.
B009GEPSDK|5.0|Liked this one allot, suspense right up to the very end. Keeps you guessing and creating all sort of possible scenarios, in the end.... I'll not tell see for yourself.
B007N31Z06|5.0|Classic movie. John Belushi is a crazy version of ourselves that won't give up his inner child. He's great in all of the sence.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|when I got all those tokens and I made me start all over again and all of my people from the game were gone
B00899DR40|5.0|Denied his music for three years but this album is poppin. RnB melodys mixed with pop and somewhat rap. Best music from him in my opinion.
159562015X|1.0|I paid extra for the 1-2 business days, a week later....still nothing, needed the book for an Exam, but never even got it to use and study from.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game.  I play it everyday.  It's challenging, but not too challenging, so I can actually move on to the next levels.  The graphics are very nice, and it's very addicting.  I highly recommend downloading this game.
B00000K3D4|4.0|Even though when this is an old movie it has really nice effects taking into account the year it was made, but for me the most important thing was the message, I loved the customs in the ballroom and the general idea. The first time I saw this movie was on the movie theater, this is the second time I´ve seen it and just have to have bought it.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I can never understand the two or two and a half star rating whenever this movie pops up on the tv schedule. Always a fantasy fan, I found this a superb film by Ron Howard that stands up to the test of time. It has a bit of everything, magic, dragons, witches, monsters, Val Kilmer, princesses etc etc etc. People would always say, 'But have you seen Legend with Tom Cruise?', and yes I have. I have watched Willow countless times over the years, shared it with my children/friends/family and I have watched Legend a total of one time- one time too many. Why isn't this available on Blu Ray? HD? PRIME? I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really liked the first Crossfire novel, and, like most, was anxiously awaiting this new one.  I thought this was a great follow up that kept me intrigued.  If you liked the first book or if you are looking for a new series, this is a great series (with the third and final book yet to come) to get into.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|Can't believe this sits at 4 stars on here. Had to counteract with a counterattack. I adore the first 2 Bourne Movies in this series, the 2nd being my favorite (it had feeling, vision, and purpose) , the third feeling a little too handheld even for me, but it ends very well.. \\"Bourne Legacy\\" is muddled and so far afield from what was introduced in the original movies that it's indecipherable. Had they not transplanted Jason Bournes picture in this I would have never even guessed this was the same series.. different colored pills/medications/dosages? Where did this come from? The movie moves at a snails pace, and although I've liked Renners' performance in everything up until now, particularly \\"The Town\\" I have got to steer as many people away from this mess as humanly possible.. not the worst movie ever but one of the worst sequels in recent memory.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really love the story about Gideon and Eva....They have a love between them that is both precious and sadistic at the same time.  The story started out a little slow for me and about half way, it got really good.  I loved the ending and I can't wait for the next chapter in their lives to be revealed.
B002APU580|4.0|A great watch if you're looking for a fuzzy love story.  It's not terribly far from the book though quite abbreviated in comparison to previous adaptations.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I love this Dictionary it has helped me with my homework and helped me with my English studies and when I have nothing better to do I read this.
0060873027|2.0|You can immediately tell that this was not completed by Michael Crichton himself.  The plot and logic reads like it was written for fifth graders.  There are too many coincident events and easy-outs for the characters.<br /><br />Yes, it was easy reading but it insulted my intelligence.  R.I.P Michael; we'll miss you.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have read every Scarpetta novel, and have enjoyed them all.<br />I realize that in order to keep a series going, different elements have to be introduced, and the characters deepened.<br />However, the last couple of books have had Kay go through periods of self doubt and general weirdness that don't really ring true with me. I would love more of the mystery solving without all the angst in future books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it is very helpful in decorating ideas. it also has alot of craft ideas that i can do with the kids
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have been a fan of Ken Follett since I read Pillars of the Earth twenty years ago. Winter of the World caught my attention when it came out, but I read Fall of Giants before I started it. Both novels are wonderful for several reasons. First and foremost, the continuing story is a great read. I swallowed both books in less than two weeks. The second reason is the history is well researched and vivid. As much as I have read about WW II, I had no idea how close to victory Hitler and the Axis came, except for the brave battle fought by Britain until the U.S. joined the war. Third, since I am a writer of historical fiction, I studied Mr. Follett's masterful way of building the world of the past and blending fiction with fact, and his expert handling of many story threads and characters over decades of time. Reading his books has been like taking a graduate course in writing historical novels. I am waiting for the third book, wondering where he will start it and what will the happen to primary families through the long cold war.
1847940684|5.0|This is a great business book.  Not boring like many of them.  I actually highlighted and took notes so I would remember some of the suggestions.
B00A202A3I|5.0|The episode starts with a mysterious character setting up a zombie lure into the prison, which seems crazy, right? Who would do such a thing? The perpetrator is not immediately revealed. Nor is the betrayal revealed until the prison group is divided in different spots. And they've decided to get rid of the two remaining live prisoners by sending them out on the road. The prisoners begged to be let out of their cell block since they are having a hard time cleaning out the zombies and other corpses. Rick says a deal is a deal, and offers them either the cell block or the road. They reluctantly agree to hit the road. Then the stuff hits the fan and everyone is running for cover from zombies. Lori is caught with her son Carl and Maggie. She starts having contractions and the baby is coming. Meanwhile, everyone else scrambles to get control of the situation.<br /><br />Back in Woodbury, Andrea is having second thoughts about leaving a nice, secure place. Michonne discovers more evidence that things aren't what they seem and that the National Guard was attacked by someone with guns. Merle shows some more depth as he finds out about his brother's whereabouts and wants to find out more. The Governor does his best to keep everyone in line and in Woodbury. When will this powder keg go off?<br /><br />This episode was tough to watch, what with the debate about sending the prisoners off to their doom, Lori giving birth, cherished characters dying, lots of gore and sadness. But it is very compelling and I can't wait for next week's episode!
B004T340QY|5.0|Pleasant surprise; much better than the men who stare at goats! I really enjoyed the music and even bought some of the soundtrack songs!
B00834R580|5.0|I enjoyed this retelling of the story.  It grabs you from the start and while remaining true to the original story has a thoroughly modern twist.  And the premise is both scary and believable.  Would make an excellent Halloween movie for grownups.  I would strongly advise that parents preview it before letting younger kids watch it.  I adored the story line and I will watch it again.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was totally awesome and very well written. I would highly recommend it to any American. It made my heart swell with pride to be an American!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Really enjoyed the book could not put it down, looking forward to the next one.<br />Recommend this book to anyone
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works well with my kindle.  I love being able to manage my favorite recipes, crafting ideas, and gift ideas.  Yahoo!
B008I43DYU|5.0|Because I am never far from my kindle Fire, I find that I reach for it when I need a calculator.  It has served me well for what I use a calculator for.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|was a fun movie..very silly in some spots overall good music and a good time. Tom Cruise was a crack up!
B0098VXE50|5.0|You would think Snow White was a children's video; it's not (the fight scenes)!!  It's very well done!  The elements of the original Snow White are there, but to see the evil portrayed in the queen is vivid. The dwarfs, and the apple are there, but the huntsman, and the friend/brother gives Snow White a lovely twist, as well as the final battle.  I'm expecting a sequel.  The kiss to wake her up was from the huntsman!
B007SXB498|5.0|I ordered this book on my kindle, and as usual the item was on my device in just a few seconds. What to say about the book itself? A classic, most avid readers know and many like. As for me , regardless of how many times I read this story, Jane Austen never fails to transport me back in time and capturing me in her world.
B00992CF6W|5.0|o my gosh 7 bucks on I pad its free. .  I'm waiting as long as it takes til its free  whooo
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great price, great building quality, the battery last as least 7h with surround on.<br />Perfect to see movies or play games.<br /><br />Recommend this headset to anyone.<br /><br />Just one thing.. It's a little bit heavy to use for extremely long periods of time.. (+ 7h).
0307456323|5.0|Delightful characters, well written, quick read. Perfect for light reading. Love Capote. Felt like I fell in love with Holly.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's Books except the first one.  I enjoyed this book the most because of the setting and the mystery.  Set in England during World War 2,the history and characters came to life for me.  I was pleasantly surprised with the ending as well.  A very good read.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|We purchased this movie for our 4 year old after we had gotten it from Redbox at least 3 times and with many more requests for it. Very cute movie. Wonderful animation and songs. It is a movie our whole family enjoys and watches over and over.
B009LZH5AI|5.0|As long time viewer of TBBT, it has been fear that over the years the show would become stale like many shows that last as long as this show has now in its 6th season.  But this show is still as creative as it was on day one.  Can't wait for the next episode!
B005CFWNPI|5.0|I have these same sandals in black and I love them - I have a narrow foot (size 6.5 or 7) so I ordered the size 7 and they fit perfectly.  I decided to order them in khaki as well and strangely, they were a little wider than the first pair, but still comfortable as all get out and I'm sure they will be fine.
B009PJAC5K|5.0|I've been a fan of \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" for a long time now, and the love is still there with another great episode like this one.  A must see for any TBBT fan!!!
B003THJA1G|4.0|Good show,<br />Good solid characters and as the season develops the characters are displayed admirably. It is fun the suspension of disbelief for a the main characters to continue to function in their roles. The tension between the antagonist and protagonist is great and well maintained. The search for the story each episode indeed, entertains and engages the mind in understanding the clues.
B009AHWLHE|5.0|This movie is a total fan-gasm for RE lovers. \\"Damnation\\" stars Leon S. Kennedy as he investigates a brewing bioterrorist attack in a small eastern European republic. And where you've got Leon, you've naturally gotta have Ada. Mirroring the video games, she surfaces every once in a while to provide Leon with some much-needed assistance. Hunnigan makes an appearance, too, but that's about it for canon characters.<br /><br />The characters in \\"Damnation\\" are all very fleshed-out and easy to sympathize/empathize with. Leon's European allies, especially, are extremely likeable and genuine, *SPOILER ALERT* making it almost heartbreaking when a certain few of them succumb to the virus *END SPOILER ALERT*. Without a doubt, the multidimensional characters are brought to life by superb writing and voice acting.<br /><br />\\"Damnation\\" looks great. What more is there to say? Movements look fluid, facial expressions look natural, and textures look almost real.<br /><br />If you're an RE fan (especially one with a bias toward Leon and Ada), then you won't regret seeing this film. At the very least, it will hold you over until Capcom releases more DLC for RE6.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I found the book had no purpose for me.<br />I kept waiting for a message or a meaning and there was none.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its awesome, although some of the things that use energy are kinda kinda stupid, like when you buy a vehicle.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great free game. Once you gather all the prizes, you get bonuses such as getting the prixes that fall off the sides, faster coin regeneration, more special coins, and so on. You have a limited amount of coins to start, but if you're patient, you'll get more when you run out. No need to buy more unless you want to. A lot of games have this feature. To stay out of the coin store and keep pop ups away, play offline.<br /><br />Once a couple of the puzzles are finished, they are supposed to unlock mini games. I don't mind the internet connection bit, but am annoyed that the mini games don't work.<br /><br />Other than the one issue, this is a highly addictive game!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is an amazing writer ... I listened to \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\" abridged back in the 90s and have been hooked ever since.  Replaced loaned books ... have them in paper AND ebooks AND audible ... I am definitely a Gabaldon junkie.  My recommendation, read them all ... you will love the Frasers!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I absolutely loved it, just wish the next one was here as I want more.........blows fifty shades out of the water.
1118109791|5.0|Very happy with purchase, received the book on time like it said, the book is new never used with all the codes and CDs included
B008OOYALE|5.0|a very fun and entertaning game if i say so my self. even for me. i tend to think nothing could keep me occupied but this game did
0525953728|5.0|A No Spin account of the men who carried the fight and ultimate revenge for 9/11. Heroes willing to put their lives on the line for the United States. Straight forward, no sugar coating.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland Season 1 lives up to the hype and deserves every award it received. It has a great plot with extremely talented actors.  Enjoyed every episode and look forward to future seasons.
B002BWCJOA|5.0|I loooooove this movie. I can watch it over and over and over. Great for al ages! Graphics are amazing keeps your attention all the way through.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I hem'd and haw'd for a LONG time before purchasing this book for Kindle. I heard both extremes from both friends and Amazon reviews. I found myself in a lull and decided to read it. And...it's just OK. Yes, I'll be buying 2 and 3 because I just cannot leave something undone! :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book, must read!  Very well written, I was engrossed from the very beginning!  Wonder if they plan on making a movie out of this one?
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Timekeeper. It's an easy read, and was a nice way to while away a few hours at a cottage on the beach. Thought provoking, and moving at the same time. Highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed Gone Girl and read it as fast as possible.  I am an avid mystery reader and Gone Girl was different from the usual plots of cat and mouse.  The author developed the husband and wife characters beautifully, and the switching of perspectives, each chapter, kept me wanting to see both sides.  I was always changing my mind...at the end of a chapter I would be favoring one or the other and then switched as I read the opposite view point in the following chapter!  I loved the ending and immediately bought Dark Places.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As always the author dose not disappoint ,there is humor, family, love and friendship beside the killer.and the evil web is spun
B003AYMZO2|5.0|This has been a very interesting show to follow.  I've watched all the episodes recently on Amazon and I have no complaints.  The show is awesome.  The material gets better and better.  I have thoroghly enjoyed it.
B007SGM084|5.0|All I can say is wow. This book is incredibly intoxicating! By the third book I got a little sick of the sex scenes, but the books are amazing! This book will not disappoint!
B0085LGL5E|5.0|I love this cd!  It's nothing new or different, but that's not what I wanted.  If you like classic Hives sound, this is for you!
B008SVFX96|1.0|I always knew there was more to Richie Sambora than being a fantastic guitar player and backing vocals to JBJ, but this album proves just how good he is.  It is different to the songs you will usually here him perform, so takes a couple of plays to appreciate, but well worth listening to.
B005LAJ1H2|3.0|I was lovin it until the end, can't believe that happened to jimmy i thought he kept things interesting, just don't see season 3 getting any better besides more people getting killed. HBO is really going to have to show me something good on season 3 before i continue to watch. Jimmy to me was the main character i was thinking he was going to learn from his mistakes and inherit it all. I was proved wrong
6305428042|1.0|This DVD is defective. It freezes up and must be restarted. The return policy for DVDs is very bad. I know I paid very little for this, but the disappointment in a shabby product was a bigger debt.<br />Shame on you, Amazon! I would put a spell on you, but I don't want the fall out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|this book was so fun to read. i cant say much that would not give to much to other readers, but from the beginning i formed ideas for the various characters and thought who i liked and who i hated; however, i had to keep changing my mind until the end when i decided none of the characters were \\"Nice\\" except maybe for nick's mother but she dies so quickly and she takes the nice with her. basically, every character was nasty, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable. but the ending was awful. like the first reviewer said, it seemed like she didn't know how to end it so she just stopped writing. I wanted to know how they all ended up, especially nick and amy but i guess i will have to supply my own ending to it. Had it had a proper ending, i would have done 5 stars but had to take one away.  but it was fun. i would take little breaks throughout the day to sneek a chapter or two. and ultimately im not sure i would buy another book from this author. i guess i feel a little cheated.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Austin Kleon gives all of us enthusiastic permission to embrace our individual creativity. Thumbs up to Mr. Kleon. I will recommend this book<br />to all of us who have doubts about making something special.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMilles \\"The Panther\\" follows in his tradition of all previous<br />John Corey Novels; Fantastic. Although the overall subject matter<br />of these books is serious the injection of continuous humor in the John Corey character causes insomnia,<br />cutting into your sleep as you just can't put it down.  Thank You Mr DeMille
B003WJ6AD2|5.0|Legend is a great movie with traditional fantasy themes of good versus evil.  Right and wrong are clearly defined with Good ultimately triumphing after a few moments of despair.  The plot is straightforward and doesn't have the recent baggage of twists and reversals that recent movies seem to need.  While I love a byzantine plot with a large cast; sometimes a clear-cut and simple story line is refreshing.  The acting is adequate if a bit cheesy at times, and Tim Curry does a great job of being a monolithic entity of evil.  I originally watched this as a child and still love it as an adult.  The entire movie is a well told fairy tale that involves conflict without gore and constant bloodshed.  Good wins not with brawn and armies but with cleverness and turning Evil's hubris against itself.  I recommend Legend as a good movie for everyone including children.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I think this is a really good app. I have not heard it go off lately. I am probably sleeping through it. Oh well, life goes on.
0061142700|5.0|I love this book. whenI was a kid, my mom used to read this book to me. Now I read this book to my kids.
B003XRELEI|4.0|This book is not a sequel to Slaughter House five. It is it's own book. It is a well written book with crude pictures, and crude characters (one character who happens to be in S.H.5.). This book does what a good book is supposed to do.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|You laugh, you cry. It's hard to find the words to describe this book. I think you just need to read it!
0385536828|5.0|In 1972 the Cold War was still making British government and citizens very nervous. Communists were the enemy and subversion of their message was the job of the British Secret Service.  This part of the war, however, would not be carried out with killing machines of guns and bombs but through the fiction and non-fiction messages that famous and not so famous authors would pen and circulate widely in professional and non-professional places. No limitation would be placed on their literary efforts and published works.  Propaganda need not be overt!<br /><br />Serena Frome is a former Cambridge student who briefly carries on an affair with a professor who once worked for the British intelligence agency - M5.  That agency was often at odds with its sister group M6.  In a stunning series of planned events, Serena's lover drops her but guarantees her a job in M5.  While there, she is slowly eased into a job of getting a \\"new\\" author to write a novel. The story could be about anything and will be funded by the government.  As he becomes more well-known, more will happen.  Little does Serena realizes her reaction to this writer will be so passionate and little does she realize how jealous her immediate boss will be by her vehement connection. What her new friend pens is far more harrowing and upsetting to Serena.<br /><br />Sweet Tooth is quite simply an amazing novel about the multiple ways in which smart people maintain an innocent, blind attitude toward what so obviously lacks credibility.  Every single character in this story shares that naive mental and emotional stance.  Patriotism and passion are stunningly manifest in flagrant stupidity.  Upon finishing this novel, should the reader say, \\"Oh, I wouldn't think like that; I wouldn't miss those clues. I don't hold beliefs like these characters?\\"  Probably not because we are so inundated with our own contemporary propaganda that few truly analyze, critique, and speak out against what is really quite harmful distortion.<br /><br />Sweet Tooth is a well-written novel that should be read by as many people as possible.  Its satiric message is so necessary.  This tendency to become star-struck by intelligence and \\"shared secrets\\" should be a warning bell if we would see government shaped by the people and not the reverse.  Congratulations, Ian McEwan, for a vital novel, a must read for people of all nations!br /><br />Sweet Tooth is a well-written novel that should be read by as many people as possible.

014050639X|5.0|This is a nice board book to introduce your child to nursery rhymes. The illustrations are clever, and there are small hidden details that even keep an older child interested. While the book does not actually tell any of the classics, as the reader you can explain them bit by bit as your child grows.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i never have any problems with this app! Best app ever!!! Its easy to use and the text is big enough to see!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I adore this entire album! Can't stop listening to it. I already knew i liked two of Lana Del Rey's songs, but I had no idea that I would literary enjoy every single song on the \\"Born to Die\\" album.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I fell for my Kindle's prompt thinking I'd be able to use Officesuite more  efficiently in class....obviously that's not going to happen.
B008OOYALE|5.0|really  enjoyed this game . i have wanted a game easy to play........ even let my kids play.... easy to follow
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|My girlfriend and I really love this show.We really look forward to each weeks new episodes.We are really hoping that they continue on after this season.
B008I43DYU|5.0|App works exactly the same so far as the version on my iPhone. Good application and well worth the price. (Free)
B009ESIGHI|1.0|It seems from the reviews that this is the cut version without \\"Love is gone.\\" I see no point in buying until the full movie is out on Blu-ray.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Bought, downloaded and used within 10 minutes to take photos. Photos are beautiful, camera app worked well, easy to understand. Point, shoot and click. Done.
B000FBJHEO|2.0|The video trailer for the movie looked very interesting, but the book seemed to lose me.  I forced myself to read it because I purchased the book.  Not one I would read again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm in love! ive found so many great ideas on here it rediculous. simple ideas for my house, holidays, cleaning, decorating, I love love love it!
0525958002|4.0|I remember Duran Duran and the cool music videos. Interesting tale of a rock star spiraling out of control through drugs, alcohol and partying. He is a survivor through his demons and finally achieves peace and contentment with his children and wife who owns Juicy Couture!!!!<br /><br />A little wordy about the techniques of the songs and videos. I like a more personal view when he opens up about being in rehab, his parents' death, father's dementia. Powerful there. Overall, a good read about the ups and downs of rock and roll.
B00001U0DP|2.0|...but imagination is not life.<br /><br />Please skip this review if you have not seen the movie yet.<br /><br />I found this movie well-made and entertaining but also contrived and unconvincing. There is also something disturbing which is probably caused by a supposed disproportionate impact of Benigni's ego on the movie. And this does not seem to concern an aspiring (or even failing) artistic ego, I would say, but rather an exhibitionistic ego.<br />This movie is imagination-driven and creatively and culturally interesting, but it is not uplifting.<br /><br />Maybe the core of my criticism of this movie is that the playful and daring and unlikely attitude Guido has towards his son (in the second part of the movie) in those existentially pressing circumstances, is that this attitude can only be approved or justified, I believe, if it works, that is: when it has the intended effect of appeasing the mind and heart of the son. In the movie it does have this effect and so the attitude could be approved (in the context of the movie). Yet, this attitude works precisely because the movie is a product of (Benigni's) imagination, it (only) works in a contrived imaginary world.<br />So Benigni provided a context for an unlikely attitude to work. But to what avail?<br /><br />Also the portrayed or suggested braveness of Guido in the camp is unconvincing and hollow; this braveness could be sustained only because the reality in which Guido lives has been bended by Benigni into an unlikely artificial reality.<br /><br />I do think though, this movie does evoke an interesting question:<br />Can the creation of subrealities for somebody else (and presenting it as real) be really helpful for that other?<br /><br />Admitting that this movie is creative and energetic, I ask:<br />What does Benigni's creativity and imagination in this movie (intend to) serve apart from being merely entertaining?
B0098VXE50|3.0|This movie is a solid three stars.  The special effects are great.  The story is a good adaptation of the Snow White story.  The acting was good, not great, thus only three stars.  But, still, a good movie.  Charlize Theron makes a good evil queen.  So, all in all, a good movie.  Thank you.
B00932HEX2|5.0|I really enjoyed the show, they do a great job of showing both sides of the story and Claire's performance is just amazing.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Here's an example of how a movie can be enjoyable when it has a good story without all the bell and whistles of special effect.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series.  I personally like it better than 50 Shades just because it is well written.  Can't wait for the next book.
B00632HWOG|2.0|It does deliver my mail. Very annoying and asks me to sync my contacts every time I open the app. A good app should remember your settings.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Season 4 of \\"Castle\\" starts and ends with game-changing episodes. But all of the episodes in between are great, too. You get the trusty episodes with twists and turns that are all wrapped up in an hour, in addition to the continuing story arc revolving around the mystery surrounding Beckett's mother's murder. I really appreciated that in season 4 all of the characters have finally come into their own - including Kate Beckett - and the supporting cast gets more of a chance to be a part of the action. There are some great scenes where characters Kevin Ryan and Javier Esposito get to shine. And through it all, you see Beckett and Castle becoming more of a team, on and off duty. I'm glad I've added Castle season 4 to my DVD collection.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I heard that only hard core Johnny Depp fans would enjoy this movie, so maybe my review doesn't count haha. LOVED IT!
B00846REIS|2.0|Kept waiting for this book to get better and have some depth, but it never happened.  Wasn't enough to intrigue me into getting the second book.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|This would have to be the most excellent biography I have ever read. A potentially 'dreary' subject was written about with such masterly skill that I could not put this book down. I wish there were more biograhpies written with such excellence.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|I simply adore this movie. I could go on about the lush visuals or the fantastic soundscapes, or the very human emotion that each and every single actor brings to their roles, but that's all been said.<br /><br />What I will say is that this is my \\"working movie,\\" the film I throw in my DVD player when I need the motivation to write a long paper or get a lot of work done on a big sewing project. It's part of a routine I have to help me power through writer's block, or take a break from a tough bit of sewing to watch Lucky Jack give a pep talk at just the right moment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you want to experience an awesome game, Minecraft Pocket Edition is the way to go! It may look like just a bunch of cubes, but it is way more than that. Oh, and by the way look out for creepers!
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is the best app ever! I love it sooooo much &lt;3 so fun and entertaining. helps finds creative fashion ideas, cool nail art, makeup and hair looks, and delicious recipes. seriously addicted!
0385535147|1.0|I have read all of Mr. Grisham's books.  They day they go on sale, I buy them.  I start reading them and end up being unable to them down.  The Racketeer, was the opposite.  I started reading it, put it down and found myself almost unable to pick it up again.  The only reason I finished the book is I felt it had to get better.  It didn't.  Wait until it is your turn at the library to get and read this book...
B007FEFLTO|5.0|If you like historical fiction you will read both Century Trilogy books without stopping to eat or sleep.<br />Winter of the World reminds us that history repeats itself.  The rise of the Nazi party was through hate, lies, brutality and without a majority<br />political position.  I feel our current political landscape in the US is vulnerable. The party of fear and hate, under the guise of loving America,<br />is rising.  Read the book, see if you can find yourself in the pages.  Which side of history would you have been on, and which side are you on now?<br />A full plate of food for thought.  This book should be required reading for all college students.<br />I look forward to book three.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I grew up in South Africa during the 70s, so Rodriguez is part of my teenage years. Saw the piece on 60 Minutes and was eager to see the movie.  I thought I had Cold Fact on cassette but a search of my shoebox of old and forgotten cassette tapes dating back to my teen years sadly did not reveal it.  Just saw the Searching for Sugarman movie and was brought to tears as the memories of my childhood came flooding back. Maybe I'll find my old cassette tape of Cold Fact one day, but I can't wait to get the CDs.  I'm a fan of Bob Dylan too, and I just realized that it's probably because he reminds me of Rodriguez.  For me, Rodriguez strikes more of a chord and epitomizes such humbleness and sense of privacy, gently adrift in a world of brash overconfidence.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app for being on the go a lot. its hard to run out the house with your Bible to work so ill just bring my kindle!
B009EE6PTS|4.0|this movie existed. Never saw any trailers in the theatre. And I go a lot. It was pretty good the effects were great. I think they could have added more depth to the relationship with the cousins.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|nice ap but of little use unless you are connected to wi fi.  can't save anything to your kindle so must have access to use it.  seems a bit useless in that regard
B009HXG9UQ|3.0|Pretty boring for such a great cast.  Ultimately my wife walked away from it after about 45 minutes, I finished but to no real satisfaction.  Just plain boring.
B004RKXHZY|4.0|As a fan of the first book and a fellow Nerdfighter, I was excited to read Ms. Perkins latest. I was not disappointed. Lola is fascinating; her parents are a trip, and I loved the neighbor boy aspect of this romance. My only criticism--and it is slight--is that the boys in this novel are not as clearly drawn as St. Clair or Josh in her first book. Overall, however, the read is quick and enjoyable, and Lola is a girl I can only hope my future daughter will aspire to emulate.
031620157X|5.0|I bought this book as a gift to my 14 year old daughter. So, she wrote the review: \\"The author created a good and expected future for the fairy tale characters, you can imagine they growing up this way.<br />The book makes you cry, makes you smile and you can't stop reading, you must know what will happen. I had my own hypotesis<br />about what would happen, but even if they were right the rest would still be a good surprise.<br />I liked the book a lot and can't wait for the sequel.\\"
1451620829|5.0|There are already quite a few well-written, very detailed reviews of the new Peter Criss autobiography, so I won't belabor the point here.  The bottom line is that this is a fantastic read and easily my favorite KISS-related book so far.<br /><br />There is some truly incendiary stuff inside, and as a loyal member of the KISS Army who has read practically everything he can find on the band and its members, I'm truly stunned that there was so much in the book that I had never heard before.  Ace joined Sweet Connie and did what?  Did I really just read that?  And the thing about Mark St. John?  Did I really just read THAT?!?  I was mesmerized by the level of detail Peter gives about the reunion tour(s) and what he was paid.  Not surprisingly, Gene and Paul take a beating in this book.  Who didn't see that one coming?  But who knew that Peter had such a dislike for Tommy Thayer and Doc McGhee?<br /><br />I have to keep reminding myself that all these stories are all obviously just from one man's perspective.  Did everything happen just like Peter says it did?  Who really knows?  All I know is that in this book, Peter comes off as a very likable, open & honest guy who has put together a tremendous autobiography.
B003UM6MPC|5.0|This is just the soundtrack of the BTVS episode \\"Once More With Feeling\\".  My kids have now watched the series and loved this episode.  They have the sound track to both this and Dr. Horrible and they get plenty of play time in our house.  Yea Joss Whedon!
B004SUWR2C|1.0|WON'T LOAD, STILL WON\\" LOAD. TRIED FOR THE TENTH TIME<br />AND GUESS WHAT.....NOW IT WON'T LOAD.  GETTING FRUSTRATED<br />BECAUSE...IT'LL ACT FUNNY BUT .....W O N ' T  L O A D !
B008MG1E4A|4.0|If your interested in this type of thing, it is a very good book.  An important piece of history is given to you all while being thoroughly entertained.  The pages fly bye effortlessly.
B005VJ8ATS|1.0|From the looks of it this film IS simple and for emotional simpletons. It looks like your typical trendy 'Lets make a movie that is a emo hipster drama and call it another genere' movie. It's all emotional crap, no science fiction involved hardly, which is funny since the trailer tries to make sci fi fans interested by misrepresenting it. If you're going to call yourself a SCI FI film, at least have some SCI FI in it other than a backdrop. This movie is probably full of emotional crap, and if you want something cerebral about parallel earths, the first season of SLIDERS blows this crap away. Then again, that is actual SCIENCE FICTION as opposed to HIPSTER CRAP.<br /><br />Sci fi is supposed to be about intelligence and and hard science primarily, leave the emo drama crap as a afterthought. IF you don't like it, go read another review, or go watch 'Twilight' which is about the same viewership level probably as this movie, only difference is that 'Twilight' is to 'Vampires' what this melodramatic garbage probably is to 'Sci Fi'.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The difference between JK Rowling and many other authors to find success in print and screen is this: JK Rowling can actually write. The Casual Vacancy is not the page-turner that Harry Potter was, but it's still engaging. You feel for the characters and care about what will happen to them. Each has a complexity that you don't expect, making the book fascinating, even if the story is a little boring. Her use of the English language makes you wish you had paid attention to your Word of the Day calendar, and serves as a reminder to be grateful for the Kindle's built-in dictionary.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|This movie gets better every time I watch it. This is one of those flix you have to own. This is a must have. I cannot wait to see #2.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|One of Pixar's quality efforts.  Highly rewatchable for parents and kids alike.  This movie has provided hours of entertainment for my family.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great follow-up to the first book. Love long, involved stories and this is one of those. Characters are very well developed.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I did enjoy reading this book - it follows the Patricia Cornwell template.  There are twists and turns, and in many ways it was a satisfying read.  The characters are evolving, and for the most part, in a direction that most readers will accept.  Nothing way out in left field here!<br /><br />As I read Bone Bed, however, it struck me that our lead character, for all her successes and impressive credentials, is not liked very much by the public, her supervisors, or her peers.  For some reason, I am finding that hard to accept.  She always seems to be in the middle of a mess that gets blamed on her.  Maybe she is really a magnet for trouble but I would expect her to be so respected that people do not automatically turn against her and her staff the minute something odd happens.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good book.  I could, however, handle reading a story where the characters simply solve devious, challenging murders without becoming personally interwoven with the perpetrator.
B000YADE04|5.0|No deep, dark plot, no misery, this is a great movie when you just want to laugh a little and have some fun.
B004FV1ESW|5.0|Simply put...If you like a believable action/crime adventure movie this is one to get. It even has a good story line to keep you very interested through out the movie.
B000VWSI8S|4.0|A good blend of two masters of their own craft. John outshines the Duke, but in a good way. Nice price too.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I really wanted to see what all the fuss was about this book and to be honest I don't get it. The writing is very poor and it feels like there hasn't been much thought put into it. The sex scenes page after page get so boring that I couldn't even read the first couple of chapters into the second book. I will not continue reading this trilogy - it really is a waste of time.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its a awesome game but I do not know how to get new materials on the maps other than that its really good
B000ICXQXI|4.0|For the 1960's, this movie was great. But guess what? It's still so much fun to watch. I had my sixteen year old son watch it with me on Halloween.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is an amazing movie. I don't often say this, but I would pay to see this movie again!  My kids are younger and saw this movie and they are obsessed with it. There is some swearing, not much.  Otherwise, the singing and the comedy are just wonderful. Loved it and highly recommend.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest plus Kindle equals love. Now I can check Pinterest any time anywhere. Easy app. No problems. I love it!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am about 3/4 finished with it and so far I have not been impressed.  It sure isn't one I can't put down.  Stick to Harry Potter.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; series is so entertaining in so many ways!  I love the history and the characters are so real.  The setting is beautiful and you feel transported to another time. When I received my Season 2 DVD, I popped it in the player and watched 4 episodes non-stop.  I can't wait for my Season 3 to arrive!
B001O6W9QC|4.0|Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece.  This is a silly movie.  Watch and enjoy as you would a Monty Python episode.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie had me clenching my sides I was laughing so hard during this movie, a lot of people have problems with this movie because there is a bit of controversy but that's the beauty of free speech. As soon as this had a release date I pre-ordered  it and i can say I will get my money's worth in watching it before the year is even over (2012)
0380973650|4.0|Excellent story, mesmerizing and thought provoking. Excellent character development and plot progression. I loved it and would recommend it, well worth reading.
B000001EYW|5.0|The gees are awesome  and this is a amazing cd. Check it out. Every song is epic. If you love the bees you will not  regret getting this album.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|For the price the App is workable. I have been trying to get the updates on my Kindle Fire ,but I keep getting the message \\"Network is busy\\"<br /><br />The Excel is good ,but Word needs more work.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|This is a great show in front of some crazy fans that help the show. Great dvd. If you love ac/dc you will love this show. Get it.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I wish they would have included the character's inner thoughts like the comic. The action was well created.  The story is a must see. The movie was great.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|What an amazing show. Ac/dc is what real music is. Its pure rock and roll and that is what this show is. The vocals, Camera work, and the songs are amazing. Check it out.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|The game has screen after screen of inane dialogue and uses exactly the same scenes that were in Pirateville.  Don't waste your time and money.
0618918248|5.0|This is a great book by a great writer.<br /><br />The ways by which Dawkins guides us through the logics of both science and philosophy to solidly land at points usually left half developed or taken on faith (against FAITH) is exhilarating.  This solid ground offered to non-deists should become a rallying point from which those refusing the God Delusion can stand up and be counted , showing our true numbers.<br /><br />A sincere Thanks to Richard Dawkins!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is great. I tried to read it much slower than bread 50 shades, but it didn't work.<br />This a true romance book, I will say that it kept me on the edge of my seat more than bared to you.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille has never disappointed me. This book, as are all of his, was a great read. I always hate when one of the good ones comes to an end.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent video! Can't wait for the next season to be released. This is a great British series. The quality was great.This is a must see series.
B001W63DX2|5.0|This video is heavy on the concert footage and that's a great thing. Iron Maiden is by far the most energetic band I've ever seen live, and their music makes their shows  even better. So far I have this and Rock in Rio. They're both great, but the band seems to have more energy on this one. I can't wrap my mind around the speed and technicality of Steve Harris' playing; it's incredible. It's like him and the rest of the band are 20 years old and have been playing for a hundred years.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn knows how to birth some seriously sick characters.  The best books I've read of this kind. Twists and turns, just when you think you've got it all figured out she takes you in an entirely different direction all the way until the very last chapter.
B000VWSINI|5.0|Eminem puts out another good show with this album. The rhythm, the humor, and the obscenities remain impeccable. Any fan of Eminem won't be disappointed with this product.
0345803493|5.0|very good book.  I liked the first one better.  The book looked like it was never opened.  Thanks for amazon.  I didn't pay alot to get the book.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Having read every book in the Scarpetta series, my expectations are usually set - and met - with each book. I foundd that the main character, Scarpetta, seems to have cheered up a bit - which is nice for the overall tone of the book. I also think Cornwell did an exceptional job fleshing out Scarpetta's thoughts - especially the wandering mind while concentrating on a completely different task. All that said, the book was fabulous and the plot wonderful, riveting, and a fast read. The only downside to this book is what I found to be the somewhat abrupt and awkward ending. The choice of culprit seemed somewhat random to me; but, that is not why I read the book, I guess. I read this series because I know Scarpetta, her husband, and co-workers so well - it is like reading about friends. This series is comfortable to me - and I find the writing style has only improved with time. I could read Cornwell's written dialog all day long and am already waiting for the next book in the series!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Well written and casts a beautiful mental picture of the mans struggle with both life and death while holding tightly to faith.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Can't wait for the next book in May2013, going to be hard to wait. They truly have a screwed up life and past , hopefully the make it together. I like the story line and I doubt anyone could possibly how a life like theirs. I recommend the Crossfire books it you life fantasy
0891419063|5.0|E.B. Sledge has written a fantastic first person account of his service with the First Marines in World War II and the battles he participated in with that storied outfit at Peleliu and Okinawa.  This is an important book for two reasons.  First, the American soldier is rendered as a figure due even higher esteem for the hell he endured in Pacific fighting.  Second, any notion of war as a romantic or gloried enterprise for those fighting and dying is stripped away entirely.<br /><br />Sledge, inevitably perhaps nicknamed Sledgehammer by his fellow soldiers, left officer candidate school at college in order to take a much quicker route to the fighting via the enlisted ranks.  He was somewhat out of character for a typical recruit (though a large number of his ROTC fellows did the same at his school) in that he came from wealth (his father was a physician) and had been exposed to a more genteel form of life growing up than that which characterized his comrades.  This did not place any barriers between Sledge and those he would fight and live with for two years in some of the worst hell seen by U.S. forces during World War II. It did, perhaps, give him the desire and ability to keep notes of his experience in the pages of a New Testament he carried with him thus providing the possibility of this important book.<br /><br />I have read many memoires of soldiers from different wars.  Perhaps it was easier to see war as romance for those who fought and survived in set piece battles like Monmouth or Gettysburg.  Death and destruction certainly reigned at those fields of battle, but at least the troops could count on relief after a brief close encounter with the enemy (hours to a few days).  Then it was back to camp where relative safety could be found.  At Peleliu and Okinawa, Sledge and his fellow Marines were in constant contact with the Japanese for months at a time saving brief respites in reserve in areas that were often still in artillery range of their enemy.<br /><br />Sledge spares nothing in what seems to be a very accurate description of life during those battles.  This includes rotting and maggot infested dead as well as battlefields and foxholes overrun with human waste from front lines that often did not move for weeks at a time.  Their enemy, pledged en mass not to surrender, had to be shot, shelled, burned and dug out of caves and emplacements.  Nighttime brought even greater stress as the Japanese relied heavily on infiltration tactics where individual soldiers would crawl under cover of darkness toward our lines in hopes of knifing or shooting a couple of Americans in their foxholes before being put down.  Thus, sleep did not come easily or in long periods for Sledge and his fellow Marines.  No white flag that would cause Japanese soldiers to rise from their bunkers and surrender as a coherent force when it was obvious they could not prevail and were out of provisions could be counted on.  Just the extermination man by man of a foe determined to die for his emperor and the resulting increased casualties rooting out the enemy to the last entailed for Americans.  Sledge gives the incredible statistic that some 8,000 Japanese soldiers were killed in these operations on Okinawa after American forces controlled the entirety of the island above ground - and many extra American lives were the price of this fanatical devotion to \\"no surrender.\\"<br /><br />I found the book riveting.  It is well written, but the detail of the experience Sledge and his fellow Marines endured in fighting for his country is astounding and ought to be read by anyone who thinks war romantic or a high ideal in any way.  It is amazing what our soldiers were willing to endure in wresting the Pacific back from the Japanese - they did it with excellent discipline and maintained a fighting edge even when wracked by lack of supplies, constant rain and / or oppressive heat, battle fatigue and the accumulation of wounds, sores and ailments due to lengthy exposure to battle - and always with the knowledge that their foe was not one who could be maneuvered into retreat but a hardened adversary who had to be taken out where they were found at great cost in blood.posure to battle - and always with the knowledge that their foe was not one who could be maneuvered into retreat but a hardened adversary who had to be taken out where they were found at great cost in blood.
B009OYT4FU|5.0|Another funny episode. This is one of those rare shows that gets better and better. Great writing and talented actors with impeccable timing and delivery.

B0081BU42O|3.0|I have read almost all of Iain M Banks work.  This outing seems very drab by comparison to Excission for example.<br />Even The Minds seem, IMO, to be losing their edge.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I didn't find anything great about the book. If you are looking for a read similar to 50 Shades or Gabrial's Inferno, then this will be great
0811874192|5.0|I saw this book in a bookstore, and knew that sometime or other I would have to have it.  I love popup books anyway, but this one is extraordinary in my viewpoint.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This view of a US distopian future is fresh and compelling, and relevant to today's political dialog.  Now a great movie, it is still better to read the book first (or at least go with someone who has!).  A fast, enjoyable read.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|As a grade school kid many years ago, I used to rush home after class to watch the original Dark Shadows soap opera each day.  So, as you might expect, when I heard about the upcoming release for the theatrical version of Dark Shadows, I was curious to see what the film treatment for this TV classic would be like.<br /><br />In general, what I thought I would get from this movie was a light-hearted take on the TV show and I was okay with that.  I say this because the \\"spooky, horror\\" genre just doesn't appeal to me like it did when I was a kid.  In watching the trailers for this film, I was led to believe that I would actually be watching a satire of a TV classic with some updates added to make it a bit more contemporary.  What I think I saw was a film in which the direction it wanted to take (remake, satire,comedy, or horror) was not evidently clear and I thus felt cheated after spending about two hours watching a film which fell far short of expectations.<br /><br />The story line for the film seemed to change mid-course and seemed fragmented in these transitions.  Some parts also seemed too predictable to keep me interested.  Granted, I did have a few chuckles at a couple of points in the film.  However, those laughs were not worth the nearly two hours of agony I spent hoping the story would get more interesting and thus better.<br /><br />The experience of watching Dark Shadows left me with the belief that all of the interesting parts of the movie were shown in the TV commercials for the film. Sadly, this seems to be the case with a lot of movies these days....
0802473156|5.0|I think this book is one of the best books on relationships I have ever read. Had it been around earlier, it may have saved my first marriage.I am happy to see that the majority of reviews concur with me. I am frankly shocked by those who gave it a 1 star, what were they reading? It is a must read for couples entering a new relationship!I gave a copy to my son and daughter-in-law and insisted they read it before they got married. Nothing guarantees success in a relationship, but better understanding your own needs as well as your partners, sure improves your odds! I am not a book lover! I'm a doer! But this book was a real eye opener as well as an easy weekend read for those of you who are like me!
B007KOLNXC|3.0|It seems like the writing this season wasn't as good. Betty's is no longer interesting and don's new wife and life seem boring to me.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Robert Ludlum's series begins with Jason Bourne surviving an assassination attempt only to find amnesia is the result.  Interesting period tale of a Viet Nam veteran assigned to eliminate a notorious assassin by a group of CIA types.  Bourne ends with more bullet holes than James Bond but discovers in the end Bourne is not who he thought he was.
B005GSY23M|3.0|There are some great songs on this soundtrack. I purchased it for the Kavinsky and College songs; however, the rest of the songs are ones I doubt I'll ever add to a playlist.<br /><br />I liked the movie and like those two songs. If you are considering this for the same reasons, you might want to look up the CD's those songs were originally released on and purchase those CD's or the singles from that page. If they had offered those two as singles on the Motion Picture Soundtrack page, I probably would have just purchased them and I have to admitt I wish I had.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book was exactly what I was looking for.  A quick, light read, that enthralled and entertained.  When I go backpacking, I like to take along a work of fantasy that is easy to get lost in.  This book was perfect.  It also had several original ideas about magic and other common fantasy themes (which is always a nice surprise).  I'm halfway through the second book and it's just as good.  Hopefully I won't have to wait too long for the third.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I can't believe how the Marvel people again and again deliver the goods.<br />This movie is another must have.<br />The plot, action and special effects is masterfully interwoven to form an experience worthy of the name Captain America.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|By the third book in this trilogy, the same tired format gets pretty boring.  While the mystery of \\"what makes Christian run\\" keeps one reading, the rest is very repetitive and frankly, I don't know how a movie will be made because the story line is so weak.

B0081BU42O|4.0|Player of Games and Excession are two of my favorite SF books of all time, and I really look forward to the release of a new book in Iain M. Banks' Culture universe. However, the last few SF books from Mr. Banks have not lived up to the high expectations that I have for my favorite SF author. The Hydrogen Sonata is far superior to a lot of the new SF available this year, but it is leitmotif in comparison to the lavishly realized grand Space Opera of some of his earlier works.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|The first season of Game of Thrones was very good. It covers the entire book of the same name. The show was well made and did a good job of capturing the feel of the book.<br /> At only ten episodes this season seems more like a mini series than a television series season.
0449014509|5.0|Rick Riordan does it again! Mark of Athena was another amazing book that I just could not put down. The story continues right where the second one left off. It is another thrilling tale full of demmy gods monsters and a awesome giant dragon war ship.
B003UESJEM|5.0|I found this film to be quite informative in giving a different perspective of corporations.  Too many times, people bash corporations, thinking that they are merely businesses; however, this film helps to see the people that actually make up the corporation.  Seeing real people and how the suffering economy affects them sheds a little light on the other side of the coin.  Society is often quick to be critical about big business and unfairly uncritical of the poor; yet, no one is willing to ask, \\"how did \\"the Poor\\" become poor?\\"  They didn't become that way overnight, and society never wants to put the blame on the poor.  Why work when the government is willing to give you money free?  The Company Men was a real eye-opener.
0441009425|3.0|Many intriguing concepts in this book, hampered by the writing.  Now it wasn't terrible by any means, I'd just say uneven.  This was the author's first book, so maybe it improves in the sequels.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is a book about government and politics where it does not matter which political party you belong to, all will find it a pleasure to read .  Hoover and Truman.  Clinton and Nixon.  Kennedy and Eisenhower.  Such unlikely pairings.  Yet all these President's reached across the aisle and got help when they needed it.  An absolutely fascinating peek behind the curtain of the Oval Office.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Great hint, ideas and reviews. With REAL people and helpful ideas. I like the P on my kindle and laptop better than my iphone-only for the viewing size, but as a whole the website is awesome!
B0045HAF22|5.0|If you don't like this show, you either don't have taste or don't like TV shows.  This is the most excitement you'll get from hours and hours of television ever.
B009JNXK88|5.0|can be frustrating but it is a lot of fun with real nice responsive controls. I actually paid for the second one and beat it.. glad I get to play the first for free now.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|I have read all but one of Jo Newbo's books.  His Harry Hole series are very good.  This book contained several geographic references to Oslo landmarks that leave the American reader at a loss.  The protagonist, Harry, is a parallel to old Mike Hammer characters, but with greater self destruction tendencies.<br /><br />Not as well crafted as prior stories, but worth a read..
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Okay so people complain \\"It's not great quality because it's not in HD or on Blu-Ray and it looks horrible\\". That's a real lie. Come on! Blu-Ray SUCKS! The imagery and picture quality are just FINE! I bought this DVD of the concert at Wal-Mart and I don't usually buy a lot of entertainment (CDs/DVDs) from Wal-Mart. I may not have a flat screen HD TV in my bedroom but I have two downstairs in my home and all of them produce great visual quality with this Concert DVD. My old Tube TV also has \\"high quality\\" even though it's not an HD TV. It doesn't matter what type of TV you have or what the Quality is that the DVD was produced with. People need glasses. There's nothing wrong with the quality. The images are crystal clear as if you're right there in the audience seeing the King of Pop live.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this concert DVD to any MJ die hard fan. Or even someone who just likes watching him dance and sing on stage making magic wherever he is. Whatever the case of what type of Fan you are, I'd still tell the world to buy this DVD. I know I absolutely love it. Who needs HD and Blu-Ray? Not me for one. Some things are just better watched in it's almost original formats. Hell, most of my VHS movies have better visual quality than some HD videos.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|If it is possible to rate this zero stars I would.  What a Horrible piece of writing.  I read about 40% or so of the book, and that is it, I am not giving this any more of my time.  Sylvia Day has no business writing a book!  But she would make a great robber, as she robbed and ripped off some other authors story lines pretty well.  Enough if Enough, I am not reading any more of this garbage, and in the words of another review that I read \\"IF shit could shit, it shit this shit.\\"
B0076DCT2G|5.0|My favorite writer!  I have loved every one of his books...the Panther is as good as any!  Along with history his characters ( or some) make me laugh....Love John Corey.  Keep the books coming, Nelson.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|very slow to develop.  Not at all like previous books by DeMille such as the Gatehouse, Plum Island, etc. Thought it would be more action packed.
B00445RHKI|5.0|Every season of this show is great, season 2 is no exception. Just down right hilarious. My favorite show on TV.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I had expected the book to be great by reading other reviews. The book seemed to drag and just did not keep my attention.
1908538090|5.0|I found this book to be a complete and sympathetic view of the political aspects,as well as his personal views on the world in general during the early 1900,s of the man Adolf Hitler. Seems as though we Americans are not always taught the truth in school when it comes to history. This book will help the reader understand the motives of Hitler,if not cause him\her to see the man with a familiar compassion.
B005ZCXPP0|2.0|Much like the Thor movie, I worry that my IQ has dropped several points after watching this.  The plot is overly simplistic and the movie is more a montage of action scenes than anything else.  The movie experience of today would be much more fun if only writers would start adding some depth and complexity to their plots.  Great movie for the kids, though.
B006H063MG|5.0|I wasn't all that into watching bones when it first came out and then my husband made me sit down and watch one episode. From then on I have not been able to stop watching. I have watched all episodes three times already.. I would recommend this to everyone..
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I always enjoy reading Patricia Cornwell's books.  However, it seemed this storyline seemed to be drawn out more than her other books.  It was still a good read.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was just the right lenght for its message.  I loved the way the characters were developed and the story was told and  highly recommend this book.
0790729644|5.0|No matter how hard you try to run away from your past, it always comes back to haunt you. The story of unforgiven tells us that this is true. Clint Eastwood was my very first hero who I worshipped for quite a long time after seeing this movie in my 1990's. The story and concept of this movie really gets you attached to his character and what he had to go through in his past as a killer. Like they say, redemption comes with a price, and some sins are just UNFORGIVEN. See it for yourself and feel the pain.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a great book because of how well the author changes point of views. This book is not only out of August himself,but also through the words of his sister and friends. Truly a touching novel.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I am upset that this movie makes a mockery of some of the best years of my life.  Though there are very funny moments, they are not worth the price of the rental.  What comes in between is boring and juvenile.  Tom Cruise really stinks in this movie.  He should beg Axl Rose forgiveness for his puny performance.  I stopped watching before the end.  What a snooze fest.  Gaaack!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Sci Fi at its best! I slept with the lights on that night. Going to be a classic must see for sure.
B001FES0IE|3.0|It's been a long time since I purchased a new LP recording.  With all I've heard about how Vinyl recordings are so much better now, I expected a good sounding Album with good HiFi quality music .  What I got was a very scratchy, popping, hissing recording that ruined my enjoyment of the music.<br /><br />My first inclination was to send it right back but on the advise of some friends I tied cleaning up the record and taking out the static.  The second playing was better and after more cleaning I finally got a good sounding album.  After doing all that work I igured that I might as well keep it.<br /><br />Doing all this cleaning and conditioning of an LP album is what I expect to do when I buy a record in a yard sale for a few bucks, not a brand new recording from a trusted merchant.  If merchants expect us to pay $20 and up for a brand new vinyl album, they are going to have to do a much better job with quality control.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|This is a well-written book that captures your interest from the beginning. It is a best seller type of literature full of commonplaces. It describes in parallel the lives of a poor family in a coal mining town in Wales, too much like the 1941 movie \\"How Green was my Valley\\", and the easy going stories of a nearby noble landowner, too much like Downton Abbey. Additionally, the stories are sprinkled with completely unnecessary but money-making detailed descriptions of sex acts bordering on pornography. You won't be a better person after reading this book.
B009LZDGSI|5.0|I thought that this series would be cheesy but it actually is surprisingly good. I like that Sherlock Holmes has been updated a little but still pays homage to how the character was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I also like the fact that Watson is now a female character, it makes it a fresher take and gives the interactions more room to grow. I would recommend everyone give a least the pilot a chance.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I especially like the flowers meaning and could visualize the arrangements she made since I have a love of gardening.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is one of the most simple apps I've used, but it's very nicely done. I love how it shows the full calculation string so you can see how the result was generated (and spot your error). I also appreciate that the memory contents are displayed on screen so I always know what is stored there.<br /><br />The screen design is clear and the buttons are large. My only complaint is that it only works in portrait mode. While this maximizes the screen size, I usually have my Fire in a stand on my desk in landscape mode, so I have to flip it around to use.<br /><br />I wish my desktop calculator had all these features!
B004KZOWEG|4.0|I found King Leopold's Ghost to be a good introduction to the sad situation in colonial Africa.  I found the discussion of the role taken by such figures as George Washington Williams illuminating.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to those with a casural interest in the topic.  Serious African scholars will want more detail.
B0089LT8Y6|4.0|It is hard to call the tenth album by California thrash natives Testament a return-to-form. See, unlike their speed metal peers in Metallica, Megadeth, and even Slayer, this band has never strayed too far from their original sound -- even 1999's \\"The Gathering\\" sounded like Testament! Nevertheless, 2012's \\"Dark Roots Of Earth,\\" their second album since ditching the ultra-heavy, death metal-influenced sound taken during the Nineties, and reuniting with original axeman Alex Skolnick, is a strong Testament album through and through.<br /><br />Yes, drummer Paul Bostaph may have sat this one out, but the band recruited Gene Hoglan, a skinsman that is, without question, even a little bit more skilled than Bostaph. And Hoglan is a perfect fit with the rest of the band (the fact that he played with Testament on their 1997 album, \\"Demonic,\\" helps this cause, too.) With that said, though, the album's main attraction/focal point is, without a doubt, the superbly intricate and skilled fretwork of Skolnick and Eric Peterson, who spit out gobs of great riffs, meticulous leads, and memorable solos.<br /><br />The album begins on a strong note, hitting the ground running with the aptly-entitled \\"Rise Up,\\" a very ripping opening thrasher with propulsive guitar riffing, a winding melodic solo, and really memorable choruses. \\"Native Blood,\\" with its blistering chug and stomp, really epic guitar solo, and tight, driving double bass propulsion, keeps the listener's blood pumping. But the next song after that, the title track, is a near ballad. It broods along at a very mid-tempo pace, thus evoking Testament's \\"Practice What You Preach\\" era. And it is all topped off by Skolnick's trademark -- deliciously melodic guitar leads and solo flights. Likewise, \\"True American Hate\\" opens with a nicely melodic lead in the intro; but the song eventually morphs into a scorching, rip-roaring, full-on thrash attack. What this means is, think a flash flood of scorching riffs, thundering blast beats, and deeply surging, air-guitar-worthy grooves. Expect plenty more excellent soloing, too. And the next track, \\"A Day In The Death,\\" is highlighted by a grumbling bass intro that slams into abrasive -- if relatively more mid-tempo riffs -- and driving thrash beats.<br /><br />And the next song after that, \\"Cold Embrace,\\" is, aside from featuring some heavy, crunchy rhythms, more-or-less a straight-up power ballad. Its pretty, textured-sounding acoustic intro flows right into more epically soaring melodic guitar leads. But back on blistering territory, \\"Man Kills Mankind\\" is propelled by grinding, biting, chainsaw riffage, blast beat-esque drum thudding, and more instinctively memorable choruses. It also uncorks a wailing, high-flying solo, as well. But as good as this tune may be, it is almost forgettable when compared to \\"Throne Of Thorns,\\" which succeeds it. After a nice acoustic intro, things then abruptly turn to strong, chugging thrash grooves and thrashy drumming. And this song, which is over seven whole minutes in length, is also highlighted by what is perhaps the album's best and most memorable guitar solo. And it all ends by fading out with some of those same acoustic guitars that began the track. Wrapping up the set is \\"Last Stand For Independence,\\" which is backed by fiery, chugging guitars, and really deft and energetic drum fills, thus creating a very catchy, staccato beat that cascades down on you.<br /><br />However, what is perhaps most impressive about \\"Dark Roots Of Earth\\" is that, even with Skolnick on board, it never sounds like a simple rehash of past glories (even \\"D.R.O.E.\\" and 2008's \\"The Formation Of Damnation\\" are two different albums). True, yours truly was a little bit more taken with previous Testament releases (i.e. \\"New World Order,\\" \\"The Gathering,\\" etc.) But if this review implies anything other than the fact that this is anything other than a very good, consistent, and enjoyable album from Skolnick and the Boys, then the point has clearly been missed.arly been missed.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I don't know what I expected based on the title, but I was angry after seeing the film.  They've taken a wonderful fairy tale, with moral impact for youngsters, and destroyed all its value.  Now it's just another vehicle for promoting violence and gore.  Don't let your kids under 20 see it.  It will spoil their imagination.
B008PALH0E|5.0|You can't get much more exciting than Dudamel, the Bolivars and the L.A. Phil with more than 1000 on the stage!!  The backstage interviews and preparation peeks make this a must-have for a Mahler collection. The music is an exceptional undertaking.  We won't see another extravaganza like this in our lifetime.

B007FTZDN8|5.0|This is a must-have app if you're a fan of TED talks. The video and audio are very clear and stream smoothly in HD. What I like the best is that the talks are organized and cross-referenced by topic and genre - I've been able to find several TED talks I've not seen before. Plus, when a talk is finished, it allows you to hit a button and be presented with a list of similar talks.<br /><br />You can download talks to the Fire in either low or high res. That's a great feature for times when I won't have wifi access. The downloaded videos are available in the My Talks tab in the app. You can easily delete them (press and hold the video title and a menu comes up) if things get too cluttered. You can also bookmark talks for streaming later, with the bookmarks also appearing in the My Talks tab.<br /><br />Other options include being able to listen to the talk using audio only, and show subtitles. The subtitles are very nicely done with clear typography.<br /><br />I find the video quality, load speed and flexibility in selecting talks to be far better using this app than watching them through Netflix, and a bit better than using the TED website. Highly recommend!

0307749495|1.0|I am finally at the end of the 11 discs.  It is read by a man called Dick Hill.  I am personally going to look at every book I get to see if he is the reader.  I will never buy another book read by this man.  Maybe 1 or 2 discs could have been eliminated if he would have just stopped saying:  And he said, and I said, and she said, and I said, and she said, and on and on. You get the picture. I have never heard such a poor reading of a novel.  It really was irritating. The only reason I stuck with it was the story was interesting.
B005S9ELM6|4.0|\\"Argo,\\" directed by and starring Ben Affleck, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio (based on Joshuah Bearman's article in \\"Wired\\" magazine), is a feel-good movie based on a true story. On November 4, 1979, a horde of angry students and militants scaled the walls of the American Embassy in Teheran. Six Americans escaped and found safe haven with Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. Affleck plays thirty-eight year old Tony Mendez, a brash CIA operative who specializes in exfiltration--spiriting people out of hostile countries to safety. He teams up with two unlikely allies, makeup artist John Chambers (the always watchable John Goodman) and a Hollywood producer, Lester Siegel (played with his usual zest by Alan Arkin) to bring the six stranded Americans home.<br /><br />The plan is for Mendez to enter Iran in January 1980 under false pretenses. He pretends to be a film director scouting locations in the Middle East for his new science fiction flick, \\"Argo.\\" Chambers and Siegel had previously launched a publicity campaign, complete with ads in Variety to make their project appear more credible. Days after his arrival, Mendez provides the six Americans, who will pose as members of a Canadian film crew, with false passports. Mendez had quite a few hurdles to overcome. Among theme: to garner the support of the U. S. government for his harebrained scheme; to persuade the frightened and beleaguered six men and women to trust him; and to hoodwink the paranoid Iranians.<br /><br />This engaging movie has welcome bits of humor to lighten the mood, and the actors, including Bryan Cranston, Victor Garber, and Tate Donovan, all turn in fine performances. The theme could not be timelier, since the United States is still an embattled nation trying to protect her diplomats abroad. Unfortunately, Affleck's direction is at times a bit heavy-handed, particularly in the last fifteen minutes. He and the screenwriter create a clich&eacute;d race against time along with frustrating snags that never existed; this portion of the film feels forced and contrived. Another problem is the intrusive musical score that bludgeons us instead of blending in subtly with the story. Still, \\"Argo\\" is worth seeing, since on the whole it is an engrossing and entertaining motion picture for thinking adults who care about history and politics.ted; this portion of the film feels forced and contrived.

B0084IG8TM|2.0|Let me start off by saying that I haven't read the original books by Suzanne Collins. I would also rather not repeat the synopsis in detail here because so many reviewers have done that, with more than 2,500 reviews posted at the time of writing this. Already a huge commercial hit (more than 400 million dollars in US alone), \\"The Hunger Games\\" has garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. But is the film really worth that?<br /><br />If you looking for something entertaining, this is not the one you should choose. I almost forgot to say that this is a film by Lionsgate, a company responsible for the \\"Saw\\" franchise. You don't see much blood in \\"The Hunger Games,\\" but still watching kids killing each other is hardly entertainment, even though in the film's story it is done for the enjoyment of the rich. (Anyway, the shaky and fast-cut camera of \\"The Hunger Games\\" would not allow you to \\"enjoy\\" watching the deadly \\"game.\\")<br /><br />The heroine Katniss Everdeen is effectively played by Jennifer Lawrence. Katniss volunteers to join the game instead of her younger sister. Strangely, while the rich citizens seem to be enjoying the game so much, some even becoming the financial supporters of their favorite participants, I couldn't understand why these people are so excited about the game itself. Now I'm not talking about moral dilemma or something like that. I'm talking about how dull and even pointless the game sequence is.<br /><br />For our heroine Katniss is being given an advantageous position with regard to the game. Her \\"mentor\\" Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), at first drunk, turns out a decent teacher giving her some good advice. Her costume designer Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) is a nice person, who can help her get the \\"sponsors.\\" Even some of the game's contestants help her survive, while they should be killing her. If luck is the key to survival, the director has surely made the point.<br /><br />You may call the film a social satire. Any dystopian storycould be one, if only developed into a more biting commentary on society or humanity, which \\"The Hunger Games,\\" tame and shallow, is simply not. Even if you have not seen \\"The Truman Show,\\" \\"Battle Royale\\" or \\"The Running Man\\" - films made by the people who know what they are doing - you will notice something is not quite right with the story. In short, \\"The Hunger Games\\" doesn't convince as survival drama, social satire or love story.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is one of those rare reads that will haunt you for years and pull at your heartstrings.  Unlike anything I've ever read and yet so well written as to invade your thinking.  I absolutely loved this book!
B00064MW6A|1.0|When I first learned of the movie Catwoman, I heard that the public reception towards the first trailers - where Halle Berry, who plays the main character, hisses at some barking dogs - were so bad that Warner studios had to release new trailers without this scene that made moviegoers laugh. Now I am not sure if everybody who saw those trailers did laugh, but I am certain that everyone knew that the movie would have a rough ride at its release. Especially when they had to reshoot a whole new ending for the pre-screening reactions were bad. However, the end result was that the public, the critics, and certain actors like Halle Berry herself, admitted the movie was awful.<br /><br />At the time of the release many critics have been thrown at Pitof, the movie director, and have blamed him for the film's failure. However, I think that movie's main mistake was that it was caught in a Development Hell that went for twelve years, in which the project switched writers so many times that the original story, a sequel to Batman Returns ending that Daniel Waters wrote, became something else. And by that I mean a derivative story where an intimidated graphic designer working for two unpleasant Cosmetic company bosses, drown and become a woman-cat entity who takes the identity of Catwoman while wearing a costume that made her more ridiculous than dangerous.<br /><br />About the actors, I can say that everyone in the cast gave their best with what they got, but I wonder if they all knew, and the director to an extent, that the movie would flop at its release. Especially with a script that has awful one-liners, funny scenes at moments when it shouldn't be so, and a more or less ridiculous villain in the form of a Cosmetic Company. As such, the movie follows some of the same origins that Michelle Pfeiffer had in Batman Returns, but does it in a more ridiculous way that one wonders what would have happened if the movie had been done with Daniel Waters' original script.<br /><br />About the director, of which I saw his first feature Vidocq, it was evident that he is more at ease working through visual effects and camera shots since this is where he first started his movie career, such as some of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's works. There are some nice shots that I liked such as the accelerated day workday in the artists' office as we see Halle Berry coworkers leaving while she finishes her artwork late at night. But in general, it was too easy to see when the computerized version of Halle Berry did her stunts and when the real actress was on set. During this movie experience, I had the feeling that the production was rushed and it hurt the movie's effects. Not only that, Pitof has the annoying habit of switching angles every three seconds, and that becomes a headache to watch even on a small TV screen. So imagine the people that had to watch it in a movie theater's giant screen. Maybe that was one of the reasons why they had to cancel all the IMAX release they intended to do in 3D, apart from a probably rushed post-production schedule.<br /><br />Of the soundtrack, I found it very irritating as it tried to make itself cool, but instead made me laugh for the wrong reasons, at scenes that could have been more dramatic such as Catwoman's rebirth, her final fight with her boss's wife, and her first costume dress-up as she puts herself some makeup and cuts her hair everywhere. And with the way she does it, it's a wonder she didn't cut her ears or gouged her eyes.<br /><br />In the end, I think this movie experience hurt the character's chance of success in any movie done without Batman's presence, and the only way it could have been saved was if the artists involved had done their movie with a better script.ut the director, of which I saw his first feature Vidocq, it was evident that he is more at ease working through visual effects and camera shots since this is where he first started his movie career, such as some of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's works.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher is one of my favorite characters.  I have enjoyed every one of his full length books.  \\"Wanted Man\\" is a slight departure in that it comes across as a more ceberal role for Reacher.  Hated to see outcome of Sorenson's character.  Reminded me of \\"Kate\\" on NCIS.  Hated that to happen.  Now Tom Cruise as Jack reacher this Christmas.  What bad casting for the role.  Child describs Reacher as 6'3\\" and comes across as worn around the edges.  Cruise is too short and smooth to carry it off.  Looking forward to the movie, BUT, will have to not try to pick it apart based on the characterization alone.

B009RI5KGU|5.0|I'm a latecomer on the \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" bandwagon but it was easy to climb aboard last season thanks to brilliantly unexpectedly, incredibly funny episodes like this. The bond between the five friends and the mystery of how they will end up...together or apart keeps the show going.<br /><br />This episode that turned choosing a godparent into a game show was hilarious!

0316228532|1.0|This is the first J.K. Rowling book that I will not be holding on to. I finished reading it, and am ready for it to leave my house. I never want to set eyes on it again.<br /><br />I admit, my opinion is biased, because I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and a fan of the fantasy genre. The Casual Vacancy is not the kind of novel I would usually pick up, and I only read it due to my great admiration of Rowling. No more, though.<br /><br />Apart from the fact that the novel is based in gritty ordinary life, I feel, like some other reviewers that Rowling tried her hardest to do the exact opposite of what she did in HP. Instead of the one-person perspective through HP, here, she goes into the mind of almost all the characters, and the pace at which the narrator's voice keeps changing is dizzying. It's hard to keep track of who thinks what, and how each character fits into the story.<br /><br />Also, I did not think this was a comedy, black or not, by any stretch of the imagination. The end was just pushed as a tear-jerker, the whole situation seemed so unbelievable and contrived - a lot of the harsher content just didn't come off as believable.<br /><br />I've taken my rose colored glasses off now. Rowling writes awesome fantasy. But I won't touch any other genre written by her.<br /><br />This was a very, very disappointing read.

I do not see plot holes but I do see intentional gaps. In my opinion Ridley Scott did not want to spoon feed us all the information. He wants us to think about how the dots connect. If you like movies that make you think, this movie is for you.

B005LAIHY0|4.0|Part of the hoopla surrounding Prometheus from its earliest days in pre-production until it came out was the fact that director Ridley Scott was making a return to science fiction.  Well, that and the fact that it takes place in the same universe as Alien.  Well, Prometheus isn't quite the science fiction epic that many would hope for, but it is a highly enjoyable return to the genre from Scott, and sets the stage for future installments as well.  Noomi Rapace, the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, stars as an archaeologist that discovers the origins of mankind, leading her and her scientist boyfriend (Logan Marshall-Green) along with an interstellar crew (including a vampy Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, and Michael Fassbender in a brilliant performance as the android David) across the universe to learn the truth of humankind's origins, and naturally getting more than they bargained for.  For what it's worth, Prometheus doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does throw out a lot of ideas at the viewer, albeit a good handful of which form questions that never get answered...in this film anyway, by the time the credits roll, there's practically begging for a sequel happening.  Still, Prometheus delivers some wonderful effects, engaging story, and enough likable characters to hold your interest.  Check it out, and here's hoping that there's more to come.

B007I1Q4W2|2.0|Exit Humanity offers a somewhat different take on the zombie genre, as it takes place a few years after the Civil War.  The story follows a veteran (Mark Gibson) who begins searching for his son after coming home to find his wife as being one of the undead, and eventually leads into something much, much worse.  Narrated by Brian Cox and also featuring genre stalwarts Dee Wallace, Bill Moseley, and Stephen McHattie, Exit Humanity is a low-budget affair that isn't short on ingenuity, as it features great performances and some surprisingly stunning animated segments as well.  Though it has all these good qualities, Exit Humanity is as slow as molasses.  While I appreciate someone trying to do something new and fresh with the genre, the film is so drawn out that you will lose interest very, very quickly.  That, and a number of the characters you won't really care for, which doesn't help matters either.  If you have the patience, give Exit Humanity a look, but don't expect a whole lot out of it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was very excited to read the Reflected in You having devoured the first book in one sitting. This one did not dissappoint either. I loved it and cannot wait until December to finish out the series.

B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I specifically got this app for my grandchildren, 12, 9, and 4. They really enjoyed playing with it, drawing with different colors and different textures on the Kindle Fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|In the past for the most reading wasn't one of my hobbies (with exception of the Bible). Yet, Suzane Collins has done an awesome job by keeping my attention in this riviting novel. I read the first (Hunger Games), I am past half-way through \\"Catching Fire\\", and when I am done with that I plan to begin to read the final of this riviting, heart-breaking, and exciting trilogy.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Every time I open this app I get way too many dumb little reminders. I really wish I could turn them off. I would delete the app, but I've already spent so much time on it.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|This book was good.  Not on the same level as previous books.  It kept my attention and kept me entertained.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|Mad Men is still interesting enough to watch, but the storyline really didn't advance much this season.  I hate that all of the shows that I watch limit their seasons to 12 episodes, as does Mad Men.  It feels like there is no wrap-up to the season, it just ends because it has reached its 12-episode limit.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I find the subject absolutely facinating. And Dr Krauss does a great job making the subject even more facinating. A great read.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille pulls off another witty, sarcastic, and action-packed installment of the adventures of \\"Alpha Male\\" John Corey, this time in Sana'a, Yemen, one of the most dangerous places in the Middle East,  battling terrorists with his tough, FBI, eye-rolling, law-abiding wife, Kate.  His goal? To capture the Panther, a cunning and ruthless Al-Qaeda terrorist who was one of the masterminds behind the bombing of the USS Cole.  He's wanted for multiple terroristic acts and murders and the U.S. wants to bring him down, no matter the cost.<br /><br />As latecomers to a deadly game, John and Kate don't know the rules, the players, or the score. What they do suspect is that there is more than meets the eye to the assignment. With a half-baked, Hawaiian shirt wearing CIA agent and another CIA agent who appears to fit in too well with the Yemen population, nothing is as it seems. Kate and John soon realize that not only are they the hunters, but they soon become the hunted. John is set up as bait to lure the Panther out of hiding. Yet, there is a third layer to the plan that John and Kate don't discover until a target is literally painted on them.<br /><br />The Panther was born and raised on American soil, but identified with radical groups opposing America. As such, the Panther moved back to Yemen to perpetuate his hatred of America and `infidels.' But the Panther struggles with his conflicting views of America and his childhood and the hatred he feels for America as an adult leading Muslin Al-Qaeda terrorists in Yemen. He longs to take control of Yemen and restore it to its former glory of Al-Qaeda rule, with himself as the President. He hatred burns even deeper for John Corey and his killing of another Al-Qaeda terrorist known as The Lion (DeMille's previous book). Corey is on the hit list for the Al-Qaeda terrorists and the Panther intends to claim the reward.<br /><br />I would have liked more character development of the Panther - to know more of why he defected to Yemen and terrorism of America. What made him do it? What makes him tick? Even Corey asks the question, but doesn't really give us an answer. DeMille doesn't explore this area enough to my taste.<br /><br />It's more cerebral than DeMille's other reads, with a lot less action until the middle to end of the book. Most of the beginning is setting up the scene, getting to Yemen, parading John around Yemen to make sure the Panther knows he's in-country, and to establish the suspicion and mistrust John, Kate, and Paul Brenner have for the CIA. Their suspicion reiterates the long dirty theme of interagency alphabets not getting along or trusting each other. Each party usually has their own agenda, and it's no different in this situation.<br /><br />The book could have moved faster, with more action - for instance, why didn't Al-Qaeda try to strike sooner since they knew Corey was in Yemen? Early on in the book, we know the Panther is aware of Corey in Yemen. Considering that the Panther is known for his hasty, un-thought-out plans (explained by his council as a result of a recent badly planned and failed attack), it doesn't make sense for the Panther to wait so long to go after John Corey.<br /><br />Corey's known for his sarcastic, acerbic humor and it's on full display in The Panther. At times it was annoying and juvenile since his humor seemed to revolve around getting high (khat), demeaning women, and discussing bowel movements. Other times, his brilliant one-liners were laugh out loud. The alpha male is in his resplendent, preening glory.<br /><br />Kate was a joy and the relationship between John and Kate was priceless. It was unique to have a wife and husband team fighting terrorists, especially ones who view how to carry out the plan differently. Kate is more law-abiding, concerned with justice, due diligence, and rights while John just wants to get in, shoot `em up, and get out. His version of the plan is that the Panther never leave Yemen alive. Their banter and sarcastic humor, tempered by their real love for each other was a welcome balance to all the shifty alliances, violence, and danger of Yemen.<br /><br />DeMille's novel, The Gold Coast, is still by far my favorite, but The Panther was an interesting read.<br /><br />For more of my reviews, visit Kat's Book Reviews at [...]as a welcome balance to all the shifty alliances, violence, and danger of Yemen.

B006JPS1OM|4.0|if you enjoy missing objects games then this is another one for you.  sometimes i download games that claim to be one and fun and they drive you crazy because they,re not what the should be.  this game is worth the money and time.  lots of fun!!!!!!
B005HSL626|4.0|its quite entertaining. Corey who gave it one star is not completely right cause the freezing is not the apps problem it is his kindle. it is a fun and entertaining game but after like a few weeks it gets old.

1451627297|5.0|I had been reading Stephen King books for many years, and I was a huge fan.  In the mid 90s, however, I no longer liked his new novels.<br /><br />I have to say after reading the wonderful 11/23 I am back on the fan wagon.  The story is wonderful on so many levels.  I became so vested in the lives of Jake, Sadie, Deke, etc that I looked forward to each evenings read.<br /><br />I have taken the time to read review of some of his latest novels and can't wait to dive in!
B004TTHLBE|1.0|I gave up on this book after reading 21 percent of it (according to my Kindle.) One Hundred Years of Solitude and The Master and Margarita it is not. It doesn't even measure up to Isabel Allende's House of Spirits, plodding along as it does, never rising to the fantastic, no matter how hard the author seems to try. In every sentence you can see the will doing the work of the imagination.
030758836X|3.0|The snap-crackling pace and \\"hipster\\" vibe make this a \\"gripping\\" read - at least for the first half.  Nick and Amy are two main characters you'll love to hate. They're narcissistic and annoying. But that makes the disasters that befall them even better.  Nick's twin sister, \\"Go\\"(short for Margo) is a sarcastically fun and acid tongued side-kick.  Rand and Marybeth, Amy's whackadoodle parents, remind me of Les and Les, the kooky upstairs neighbors from the \\"Mary Tyler Moore\\" show. Amy is either a social climber or a sociopath in a Tory Burch dress.  By the end you'll know which.<br /><br />Things rock along for a while.<br /><br />Then Flynn falls prey to that vast Sahara Desert of narrative known as \\"the middle\\". Even a couple of gimmicky plot twists can't bolster the sags. What starts out as creepy and clever devolves into a \\"Lifetime\\" movie by the end.  Oh well, gotta meet those deadlines. Right?<br /><br />I'll give it three stars.  It's entertaining. At the very least, you'll be in the loop at the next book club discussion.
B009JNXK88|3.0|Game play:<br />The first thing you see is a notice that this game uses Amazon Game Circle but you can select it to be off, just do not turn it on if you don't want it.<br /><br />There are multiple scenarios like;<br />* Weapon of Mass Destruction 54 levels<br />* The Blocks Cometh 30 levels<br />* Welcome to the Jungle 30 levels<br />* Enter the Dragon 30 levels<br />* The Impossible Missions 18 levels<br />* Lite Missions 7 levels<br /><br />Every scenario has the first level unlocked so you can begin there. The graphics are simple like the old Atari style. The object is to kill all of the scientists and the fights are very gory and bloody with flying heads and blood. The second level already increases the difficulty factor a lot. In addition if you have the ghosts on then as soon as the man starts running all of your failed attempts start running and jumping on the screen and cluttering the game playing area. They are very distracting. Turn off the ghost in the settings to stop seeing them.<br /><br />You also get armed guards who shoot to kill so get them first, avoid them if possible or die.<br /><br />Main screen:<br />* Start game<br />* Statistics<br />* Settings - Ghosts, Gore, Auto-retry, music volume, SFX volume.<br />* More games - provides you links to Twitter, Facebook, email, Amazon App Store, and League of Evil Free download<br />* ? - credits<br /><br />What I like:<br />The game action is OK but the controls are hard to master as the touch screen itself is hard to hold the device while pressing on both sides of the screen. The game is playable but for me too repetitious. There are a lot of levels and they do change the challenge quite a bit. The graphics are simple but adequate and more of a retro concept.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />The main issue for me was using a touch screen as a controller for this type of game. The developer has done the best job he possibly could but for me it is just awkward. This game with a joystick and monitor would be great but having to hold the device and use the controls adds to the difficulty and frustration of the game. If this game were on a screen and you had a joystick you wouldn't have to be holding the screen at the same time.<br /><br />This is a pretty fast action game as you have to focus with minimal distractions. The game also got very hard quickly and I cannot imagine playing through over 160 levels. It is so easy to die that you will get frustrated.<br /><br />Don't forget to turn off your WIFI because of the links to the social media sites and Amazon if you let your children play this game. If you have a phone then put your phone into airplane mode so the transmitter is turned off. You might also turn off the gore in the settings.<br /><br />Summary:<br />The game play is good but gory but of course you can turn off the gore. Do yourself a favor and turn off the ghost option also. It just clutters the screen in my opinion and makes the game hard to play.<br /><br />Graphics = good retro 5 stars<br />Action = good 4 stars<br />Using a touch screen as the control interface = 3 stars<br />Frustration factor = 3 stars<br /><br />This is a good game but I probably would get carpal tunnel syndrome if I played it a lot. I would give it 3 ½ stars as a good time killer and a good retro style of game. I find the game play a little too frustrating for me so I give the game 3 stars.<br /><br />Size: Game size is 19.5 MB compressed and 31.80 MB uncompressed. i manually moved it to my SD card and it left15.55Mb in my device memory and moved 31.62MB into my SD card.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Storage - modify and delete internal storage contents<br />* Network communication - full internet access<br />* Network communication - view network state<br /><br />The game contains the code for adware named Chartboost. It also has Amazon InApp Billing, Amazon Insight Analytics and Flurry Analytics that can monitor your in app game play and actions. It uses Crittercism tomonitor the app for code failures.monitor the app for code failures.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I love this author. Never disappoints me. The Innocent grabbed me from the first page and was difficult to put down. I was sorry when it ended, but that did give me an opportunity to catch up on other things.<br />Pat
B001AUEMFS|4.0|Worth it...no matter what they said in 40 Year Old Virgin.<br />Cold play put together good lyrics with good music.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|What an interesting premise. A bookstore that's open 24 hours a day, no new book titles available for sale and a \\"secret book section\\" in the back just for members.<br />How disapointing when the mysterious code is finally revealed and you're left wondering where did this story go wrong?<br />Even so, there are well developed characters and some interesting adventures throughout the book.<br />A good read!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I couldn't wait to finally read an adult Book by JK.  Much to my regret I find it terribly boring.  I make myself read a chapter or two each day. Painful
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Loved the classic rock but would have enjoyed stage performances from the headliners instead of using the music as communication between characters, ugh!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Found this app to be very helpful espescially when your engrossed in the middle of a project or game. You can set it to tell you audibily  what percentage of battery power you have left. It can also tell you how much the battery is being charghed.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|this app only seems to load the first few status updates in the news feed. Pretty useless as it stands now. I have to check Facebook on my phone.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Another one her great stories. Well written, a realistic showcase of a family dealing with heartbreaking circumstances. Her characters are so relatable and she ties up loose ends.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I like it very much.  Easy to see with the bright color.  I can hitch my pen on the side of the case so makes it easy to keep up with.  Since I will soon be having my 80th birthday I need all the help I can get.  Also can store your cloth, for cleaning screen on the elastic. This purchase was made at Amazon.
B003GYEGNO|3.0|I found the book enjoyable once I got over Wolfe's promiscuous use of exclamation points. I found the characters to be jerks, but aren't we all.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|absoulutly loved the book.  can't wait until the next book is out.  wish it wasn't so long.  Please don't leave me hanging this long again.
030759565X|5.0|I've been reading Smitten Kitchen for a long time, and I consider Deb a welcome ally in the kitchen. The recipes in this book read like her blog posts, a conversational introduction about inspiration for the dish followed by concise recipes. Perelman doesn't take shortcuts when it comes to the quality of the dish, but she's not expecting you to go out and buy the most expensive items at your local market either.<br /><br />So far, I've made 8 of the recipes in the book, all of which have been delicious. Last night's Harvest Roast Chicken with Grapes, Olives, and Rosemary was especially delicious, and extremely quick & easy. I've got plans to make MANY more of these recipes within the next few weeks, and some of them look like they'll make great food gifts for the holidays.<br /><br />Overall, I'm completely smitten with this cookbook!
B008XG1X18|4.0|every once in awhile it will not work but when it does it is awesome... love it so much much
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I recommend Life of Pi to anyone looking for somthing thought provoking as well as entertaining. This book is hard to put down
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am not the most computer savy person at all.  I wrote out the book on an older word program on my laptop (both need to be replaced) and I had to send it to another computer to put the final touches on my book to make it ready.  That is the ONLY complaint that I had.  The system was so simple!  I definately will use it again for my next book (which I am working on now).
B00338QENI|4.0|Family understanding of complicated medical history of mother and wife so lacking.  Hard to believe no one took the time to explain to the patient or family members what was going on in this woman's short life and painful death.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have spent so many hours playing these puzzles. My 6 yr old daughter likes to play at her level also. Love it!!
B003D585E2|5.0|This is a legendary album by the great Art Pepper.  The story goes something like this:  Art, having a taste for heroin, had been fixing solid day and night for about a week.  So the morning that this recording session took place, he was totally wrecked.  But his old lady was determined to get him to the gig as it was to be with Miles Davis' rhythm section, quite possibly the greatest of all time and known as such at the time.  So Art dragged himself to the studio and somehow miraculously proceeded to play as good as he'd ever played.  Physical shape, wellness, and possible exaggerations aside, this is one of the best jazz albums there is in my book, full of technical and emotional genius.  It is top tier for sure, so do not delay in getting it for yourself, you won't regret it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't put it down. hot and steamy and completely ridiculous. a complete page turner. romantic despite the s&m plot. love!
B009CGYO0K|3.0|Not great but entertaining. It could have used more material and some more individual skits. It looks like most of the material is free on the author's website.
B000SW4DSK|5.0|I never would have thought I would enjoy a show like this. WOW...what a show. Honestly, I could do without the foul language and the nudity and in most cases such would cause me to go elsewhere. But this show is one of the BEST crime drama's I've ever seen. The main character, Dexter Morgan, is one of the BEST lead characters ever. The supporting cast of characters (everyone from his sister to girlfriend(s) to the many police officers) are all excellent as well. But wow...the story is soo good! It just pulls you in and keeps you wanting more.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book provided vivid images of the lives of people in North Korea.  If the way of life and, in particular, the methods of punishment are as stated, it is truly a very depressing and dangerous place to live.  In any case, I found the book a fascinating read.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Lugging around a small dark screen can get a little laborious and awkward. The Verso Artist Series Cases are a must have for anyone who wants their Kindle Fire to feel more portable. Using elastic corner holders your Kindle Fire is held sturdy while being protected by a thick, decorative cover. It is so much more comfortable in your hands and easier to carry that you will wonder how you got by without one.

B0086700CM|5.0|great game, very addictive. the action never stops and requires constant attention to win. We love the original version of this game as well as the brave version
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie is action pack with a great story line. It was awesome to see the actual stars who play these comic book heros come together and play in the movie.
B008BM9L72|3.0|The book was ok but really makes you wonder what makes some people tick.<br />I didn't think it was as good as eveyone one says. but that is just me.<br />reading the second book now. it may pick up as i go along

B004EPZ02A|3.0|My personal opinion about \\"PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 3\\"....was a bit disapointed. Just not as good as the first two.<br />Not a \\"spoiler\\"...the ending was very confusing...at least for me.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I love the extended version and wish the deleted scenes had been completed and also included in the movie. It's a great movie and longer is even better.
B009JNXK88|1.0|the game was very choppy and response to the controls so laggy that it is completely unplayable.  I would not recommend this game to those who are fans of the old 8-bit games.
B00356CO1E|5.0|Great Workout! It's very quick but definitely gets your heart pumping! And I definitely felt it the next day!!! I will def do it again!
B0037B6QSY|5.0|This is an excellent, non-intimidating and useful guide to mindfulness meditation.  Great for beginners.  The author sticks to the basics and gives helpful, straightforward guidance.  I have looked at a lot of these books but this is the first one that has really been helpful to me.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is a must read for any pet owner!  It is thought-provoking, sensitive, and beautifully written.  We have shared our lives with 6 different dogs over the last 40 years and this book makes me think of each one of them in a very different way.  Each time I look at our current dog, I truly wonder what she is thinking!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Once you've played through it once its not fun anymore it just repeats overagain so you don't feel like u acomplished anything
B0083P1QUM|5.0|From the first page to the very last (I didn't want to finish it, but I had to learn how it ended), she wrote non-stop action, from a huge sea turtle that could have had its origins in the era of dinosaurs to the psychological ending, it was both suspenseful and eye-awakening.  I've never been an environmental conservationist, but she included thought-provoking evidence that should make most readers stop and take notice of our wonderful world.  I've read all of her Scarpetta books and sigh with pleasure and anticipation whenever there's a new release and I'm back with my old friends that were introduced twenty years ago.  My only regret is that I have to wait another year.  Well done, Patricia Cornwell, and thank you for all I learned in this terrific book.
0385504225|1.0|I wish I read the reviews before I read the book. I also wish I did not wait for a breakthrough - that never came - for so long. Finally I wish I did not spent my weekend reading this. I am not going to dwell on how bad the writing is, how cliche and predictable the characters and the plot are, how there is no pace, and how everything builds up to something utterly disappointing repeatedly. I am just going to say it in a few words... This book is seriously boring, irritating and has nothing to offer not even for entertainment. It is a struggle to read. You are much better off switcing on your TV and watching the first thing that you tune into. I give up having read 95% of the book and I very rarely give up on books.
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|Good story, good acting, good fight scenes, good movie!  If you like a good fight/sports movie, this one will not disappoint. The story and acting get you invested in the characters.  The fight scenes are well designed and amp up the drama.  Ranks right up there with the other top fight movies.
B001RNO7BM|5.0|These are not the best looking shoes I've ever worn, but might be the most comfortable.  I recently wore these on a trip to turkey.  From the cobblestones in Istanbul, to the desert and mountain paths in cappadocia, these held up great.  The vibram sole is very grippy, and the leather upper is durable yet soft.  I'm please with the purchase and recommend these to people interested in performance over looks.
B005SS2QXS|5.0|This case was just what I was hoping for, great protection for my phone without the bulk. I've dropped it quite a few times from a height of about 3ft and the case has protected it from damage each time. It fits the Iphone 4 just right too.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|I can't wait to get back to this book every day.  The characters and mystery really draw you in. It is written in period language - wordy but makes it more interesting.  Characters are well personified.
B0038JN6VA|5.0|X mini happy speaker works great with SD card. It was worth the money and still going strong after few months of using.
B007UR1OHO|4.0|Bought this because when i went in for a brain surgery my husband's fear was the premise of this movie.  Plus how could you not love Rachel McAdams?;
B007R41E8O|4.0|I really had fun playing this game.  The puzzles were fun and the hidden objects were clear and easy to find.  The ending stunk, but overall it was a lot of fun.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Nice sequel to fall of giants.  The narrative continues to make the Russians look like inept back water peasants, but maybe that's historically accurate.  Looking forward to number three.
B006T3RM08|1.0|I have been experiencing the same problem that a lot of reviewers are reporting: my Trackpad doesn't fit very nicely into its slot and can only click once, maybe twice. Although, my Trackpad works fine when the keyboard isn't in the Clique, so it seems like the problem is actually the divider between the keyboard and Trackpad. I'm eventually going to use an Exacto knife or fine sand paper on the Clique in an attempt to make everything fit nicely, but I shouldn't have to do that, and I'm very disappointed in this product. Don't waste your time/money.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Very interesting plot with intriguing placement of characters in time.  However, the excessive use of third person voice makes reading tedious and removes the reader further from the action.  It's no secret that this is a book I have no trouble putting down between reads. Nov.16...P.S. I have now finished reading this book and must revise my review somewhat. By the ending, the author very neatly and adeptly wrapped up all the loose ends and I am glad I stuck with the story to the end. What I said about the reading being rather tedious still stands, but, all in all, this is a good book with surprising twists and turns. I am upgrading my rating from 3 stars to 4.
B00846TRHY|4.0|Very interesting tension in this film.  I loved the question He asked during the credits.  \\"If your child was abducted and I told you I could get them back, would you care how I did it?\\"
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It seems so simple and in the world of gaming, a little boring. However, even though I'm just pushing a bunch of coins along to get virtual prizes,  there's the attraction  of obtaining cute prizes reminiscent of childhood carnivals and arcades. Most of the time the Dozer holds my interest. It's not as easy to play as it  appears. In  fact it's a lot like  pool , using vectors and geometry to keep prizes and point coins from falling into a ditch. There are many levels, which I didn't understand in the beginning and sold off some of my prizes for  extra  coins and later had to re-earn them to move to the next level.  I still don't understand  the purpose  of the numbers and symbols on the  scoreboard nor the  point system as there's only  a brief description of the rules. But if  you're easily amused,  as  I have been since childhood (according to Mom), then this is the game for you too.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|One of the best books ever read.  A GREAT book not just for the erotic scenes but the story itself is out of this world.  When I finished the three books I ended up starting them again.  I fell in love with Mr. Grey - I think he is every woman's dream.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good, alright not the best in the world.but its good. Almost great. No ones reading this are they? Fun fun done
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The story is written very well, flows well, and keeps younger (and older) readers attention!  Very entertaining, without being overblown, good story, characters, and flow.  Can't wait for the next book!
B004GYY714|5.0|I was very pleased with this app. I have an Internet radio and it occurred to me that there should be an app for Internet radio and I found this one and gave it a shot. I was especially pleased to find the police and fire radios on it. That's a nice bonus if you hear sirens and wonder what's going on. In a matter of seconds I can have the local emergency radio channels on and be listening to what's going on. It's been a very good little app for me. I like it a lot.
B009329ZF2|4.0|the movies was action pack and the sound and video were both excellent on my plasma tv and surround sound system for a video rental.
B00A1ZW1JC|1.0|I had to pay TWICE for this episode of The Walking Dead because I had to try to read Amazon's mind and guess what they wanted me to do (confirm my mailing address). I had nobody to talk to and their answers page was totally useless. What I had to do was click a button, but they had me checking everywhere else.<br /><br />I may be getting back cable TV on account of this one.
B0033VUH6A|4.0|The movie is a really good in depicting the emotional impact of war on soldiers.  How they cope with the possibility of dying and how it really is an individual thing that each person has to figure out themself.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|The story is great, the protagonist lovable, the sidekick is awesome. To top it all off, the author writes really, really well. Well done!
B004EPYZZI|5.0|We brought this after watching a copy of this DVD on loan from our library.  We got 2 dvd's in this set.  They are now in two homes.  The children absolutely love it.  They are age 4 and 8.  They have seen this film multiple times and keep  asking to see it again.  SOUL SURFER is a true story which is TOTALLY inspiring.  Those who know God exists have a duty to pass this knowledge on to their children so they will know that they have a source of inexplicable power to help them with any problem, anytime.  The film demonstrates this in a very real, believable way.  The story is life-- in spades, WRIT LARGE--this is the real deal showing how God helps us to overcome the most incredible obstacles and  then He uses the event to bring others to Him.  Cannot recommend this more highly.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I am very pleased. There are lots of sound choices--favorites are the ocean, the pink sound, and the rain. Very nice app!
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|This album is flipping amazing.  Practically all of the tracks are great.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially Steve Vai fans.  It is one of his less weird albums and one of his more hard-rocking, butt-kicking albums.  Check it out, for sure.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This is a great set of music put out by Mumford and Sons. Great second CD by them. If you liked the first, then you will enjoy this one!
1469984202|4.0|I read a LOT of post apocalyptic fiction.  It is hard to find good books in the genre.  Now days, they are almost 100% zombie-centric.... Which in itself is not something I hate, but it is getting long in the tooth. Especially with the current level of media saturation.<br /><br />This book focuses more on a \\"vault\\" style setting, where the survivors of whatever event occurred, are living in a silo. It does have a touch of the dystopian, but at the beginning, that is not in the forefront of the tale. It (sadly for me) is not a story about desperate survival in the wasteland, but does touch on it in passing.<br /><br />Howe does a fine job writing characters, as well as setting.  While he is no Frank Herbert, he holds his own.  I am impressed that he doesn't spend hundreds of pages detailing the history of everything that has gone to pot, rather he focuses on the story.... Which leaves us wanting to know more of the history of why everything has gone to pot.  :)<br /><br />My only real beef with the omnibus, was the ending.  It felt like it crept up on me, and then slapped me in the face with roses. I felt it left on too high of a note, and was rushed.  I speaking of the last dozen pages or so...  I wanted the end to unwind a little more, rather than just come undone. However, as they saying goes, \\"Its the journey, not the destination\\".<br /><br />I do hope that there are more books that reveal more layers to the world that Howe has created.  Books that take you out of the silo, and into the wasteland.  Hell, for all I know, those books may already exist.  I have done little research on his other work.  Quite honestly, I wanted to review this book, because at the end of it, he asks his readers to do so!<br /><br />Two thumbs up Mr. Howe!
B00914JWSW|4.0|Beautifully done. Not my favorite album, but certainly worth having in my library. Hope she does another movie as well!
B009SJ46EA|5.0|i was worried i wouldnt lile this without the harmons but it rocks!! so warped!! also glad they kept a lot of the originol cast..
B004SBQGHS|5.0|To all, the angry birds ad free is awsome because no more worry some ads. What that means is that while playing Angry Birds Ad free NO more ads that jump in and cause you to lose consintration.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Ever find yourself eating something, not because it was good or exciting, but just because it was present? Just mindless hand-mouth-hand-mouth? That's kind of what this game was like for me. Maybe I'm just the sort for which this stuff comes easily, but I just kept doing the puzzles, and doing them and doing them without really thinking about it and not really enjoying the experience. In a week I managed to 100% all the levels in the game in my bathroom break times.<br /><br />Which is a shame because this game gets everything else right. Controls are tight, scoring is forgiving enough not to be frustrating. I don't dislike flow. I just don't enjoy it either. However, my kids do so we'll go with that and give it 4 stars.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Admission of a comic book geek.<br /><br />Great Movie!<br /><br />The movie is long but that is a good thing. The plot does have some minor holes in it but it is forgivable as it is a popcorn movie and not meant a literary novel. I wholly recommend this movie to anyone with a pulse and a zest for big action flicks.
B0027MJU00|3.0|To start, I think Gillian Flynn is a great writer.  I read Gone Girl and immediately moved to Dark Places.  I can read her books in a few days because I literally cannot put it down and cannot stop thinking about what's next. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because the ending is a total letdown.  The story is unusual as it is and she throws a wrench in at the end that is completely unforseen and, frankly, really stupid.
B005LAII0I|3.0|I just could not get into this movie.  It was slow and I was disappointed because I love Julia Roberts.
1451627297|2.0|Disappointed.  The book dragged on for over 800 pages.  Was hoping the great detail about characters and interactions would tie together at the end, but it really didn't.  In fact, when the story ended, I thought there would be more, as closure was not really achieved. A very interesting concept, but even for science fiction was hard to conceive.  Time could be better spent reading other science fiction, if that is your preferred genre.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A really good read. It put you in the room with the team. Well written, and very informative about the motivation of our Special Operations Teams.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|Great book for people like me who are tired of traditional way of cooking vegetables.  Even if you don't have all the spices, try it anyway.<br />Highly recommended
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love this game its very entertaining for both myself and children. Would recommend to everyone great to take on a plane or car trip.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|At first glance this movie is lighthearted and amusing, and has a great cast of persons.  On watching it closely, I realized how many \\"issues\\" were brought to the fore.  Just the idea that such a service could be \\"outsourced\\" is food for thought.  What is wrong with our \\"developed\\" countries that such an essential service could even be considered for outsourcing?  And then there were the intertwined lives of the many characters -- and how issues between and among them were resolved.  Thirdly -- one should appreciate how people adapted -- even though at the age when we think it is harder to adapt.  It is definitely worth watching -- with an eye for more than just the comedy and the great comedians who are in it!
B009MO5G90|2.0|I'm a RE fan. It's my \\"go-to\\" movie when I can't think of anything else to watch. Afterlife, while entertaining, was taking things a little too far. The effects were so-so in many places, and the clones bought the farm way too easily. The plot was decent, but something about the movie was really lacking. The first three were easy to \\"Get in to\\" - Afterlife not so much. I had high hopes for \\"Retribution\\" - these were left in tatters after the first 15 minutes. The effects were over-done, we don't need slow-mo for every scene, and many of the fight scenes were just pathetic and or idiotic. The ending was a massive letdown. Milla, who is usually sexy and energizing was half awake during much of the movie. It's almost as if she were stuck doing the flick, so made the most of it - but hated showing up for work. Her outfit has gone from kinky/sexy to retro \\"there was a sale on buckles at the dollar store\\" spandex. Who would have thought she could look so foolish in an outfit made up of a leather bodice, latex and metal? Ignoring the fact that nobody would ever wear that ridiculous getup. Society has collapsed. Yet she finds a custom made leather and stainless outfit? Sure, it's Umbrella - and they make some crazy outfits - but they are functional - this is just idiotic. The clones are supposed to be warriors. Yet instead of armor they get spandex and thin leather? Instead of protective plates, it's a bodice with huge hand-holds to grab. This is one reason the previous movies made more sense - her clothing looked like it was thrown together from stuff she found lying around and was functional. This is nothing but eye-candy. But then again, so is the movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. Wait for it on a streaming service.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Sorry, but I purchased this before it came out because I loved this author in the past and decided to try her again!  BUT, if she could just decide to write and quit trying to impress everyone with her knowledge of the best furniture or coffee or the best cars or how rich her family is, I could actually stay on point and enjoy her again!  But, not to be...please, get back to writing and quit trying to impress everyone with details that have nothing to do with the story...tell your story!  Please!  This author used to have me reading until the wee hours, but no more.  She needs to stop and re-think what she is doing and get back to the basics.  Your readers want to be entertained, not read a fashion book...come on, you can do it!  You used to all the time!
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Does this movie leave more questions than it answered? Possibly, but RS keeps the quality and story line at a high level throughout !
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you are already a pinterest fan, it officially got easier to use with this fabulous New app. Just can't get enough of this site, so easy to use, so east to pin and re-pin absolutely love it.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Ridley Scott should have left the Alien universe alone. This was the biggest disappointment ever. Nothing works in this failed movie, and the great talent involved (Idris Elba, Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron) is totally wasted. Whos going to give me back the two hours I wasted on this thing?
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Typical good DeMille book, with a bit of a suprise ending.  It also rings true to modern politics and Mid-East policy, or lack of.
B003WUYP56|5.0|The subject of physics is normally explained with the extensive use of detailed mathematics which are extremely complicated in themselves and can often obscure the real meaning of the topic being studied. Smolin's book does what physic text books don't do-it explains complex subjects without reliance on mathematics. Ofcourse, for a complete understanding, complex mathematics would be required for the serious student to prove to themselves the validity of Smolin's explanations. Therefore, for a general understanding of a very complex topic, this book is a great read.
B00004TCPJ|5.0|Live performances sometimes have minor mistakes but you can't beat the energy and great vibes. This one moved me right out of my chair, a classic.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is by far one of the best album I've purchased. Macklemore is an amazing song writer mix with ryan Lewis's production skills. Sound is incredible.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|It was an absorbing read, but in review it was quite far fetched and the main characters were not credible. I think it could have ended more appropriately.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|First of all, I'm not a fight fan. I watched this movie for one reason: the amazing Tom Hardy. The man can do no wrong, and as usual, he is great in this film. I never heard of the guy who plays his brother in the film, but he is also fantastic. The drunken father/trainer part was made for Nick Nolte, This dark movie is a character study, and while the characters are mesmerizing, I wish there was more back story. Enjoyed every minute. Tom Hardy rocks my world!
159315724X|5.0|Darren hardy is the publisher of success magazine and an AMAZING speaker, entreprenuer, and writer. This book should be read by literally EVERYONE!
0385344333|2.0|I've read all of the Jack Reacher books and this one is just plain dull. If you like driving through Kansas backwater roads and other dull midwestern states you might love the book if you don't care about the ho-hum plot. After 50-75 pages I found it easy to skim through many pages missing nothing worth reading. The best thing about the ending is that I had finished the book. Some books are hard to put down; this one falls in the hard to pick up category. Enough reviewers have discussed the plot. In fact I recommend you save money by reading all the reviews and don't bother to buy the book.
B009JNXK88|5.0|I must say that this isn't the best game I the world but if you get it for free it is awesome good controllers and very fun
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Blu-ray is excellent. Great action and story with an interesting part played by Woody Harrelson. Buy this DVD package now
B009GI8J1O|4.0|I bought the &#34;enhanced&#34; version, but my Kindle doesn't support graphics. I can't get my version transfered to my hubby's kindle, for the same reason, even though my kindle allowed me to download it.<br />This book was a treat - I found it to be a good read. I could not discribe what the book was about, because I was not sure where it was going, but it kept my interest the whole time.
0061474355|4.0|In a sentence or so: Necromancer Sabriel is off to save her father and lock down a seriously evil dead dude trying to cause all sorts of destruction among the living.<br /><br />Sabriel's finishing her last year of boarding school when she gets a letter from her dad, Abhorsen. He's trapped in death and needs her help. Woefully unaware of how things work in the old kingdom, but determined to save her father, Sabriel heads out to her dad's place to see what she can figure out from there. Once she gets to the old kingdom, things are bad. Like really bad. Charter stones, which are the source of her magic, are broken all over the place and clearly the work of some supremely powerful and evil force.<br /><br />Sabriel partners up with a guardian in cat form named Mogget, suits up in all sorts of sweet necromancing gear and gadgets, and she's off to save her father and probably the whole dang world while she's at it.<br /><br />This is one of the classic YA fantasy books, and I can totally see why. Heavy on the magic and adventure, Garth Nix writes for young adults but does so with a mature voice and lots of details. There were so many things to learn about Sabriel's world, and I greedily gobbled them all up.<br /><br />If you're looking to start a new epic fantasy series that isn't overwhelming, give Sabriel a go. I know I'll be finishing up this series asap!<br /><br />Fave quote: \\"But Mogget was silent. All Touchstone heard was the shuffling, wading, splashing of the Dead, as they slowly drew closer, like starving rats creeping up to a sleeping drunk's dinner.\\" (211)<br /><br />Pairs well with: A furry companion. While Mogget certainly won't admit it, I'd bet he'd snuggle right up to you while you read.<br /><br />Fix er up: The romance felt a little clunky and forced near the end. Like the editor told Garth Nix he HAD to have a romance in there and he was all OKAY FINE.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Love this app! I think it does a lot more than I'm aware of, but I like just being able to find out what song is playing on the radio. Used to drive me crazy 'cause I couldn't remember who sang that song....
B009329Y30|4.0|I have to say Zach Efron did a wonderful job in this movie. I read the book long before discussion of this movie and thought it was good. I was hesitant about seeing the movie but it followed pretty closely to the books storyline. I wasn't disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you want a replacement for your temple run obsession, this is the way to go. I actually think it's a lot better than temple run and way more fun. APPROVED.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I wanted to be able to open Word documents natively and also to create new Word documents.  The user interface for Documents To Go is not very intuitive and a little clunky.  The application is a little expensive, so I'm not likely to invest in another application, but probably would try a different Word program next time.<br /><br />Documents To Go probably should get the \\"Meh\\" Award.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|One word: addicting! I absolutely. adore this game! It is impossible to put down! I just keep playing level after level!
B000SEGUDE|2.0|This story is fascinating.  The premise of it says so much about human nature, time, and relationships.  I think the story itself is brilliant, but its written with such a lofty, complicated style that the author has essentially shot himself in the foot. The story gets lost in the language and writing style...so much that I had to stop reading it in the last 100 pages.  I just couldn't muck through it anymore.<br /><br />I am a speed reader, an academic reader, and a reader for pleasure.  I read often and much, so this is surprising to me. I was sorely dissapointed...which doesn't happen often!
B009439HEY|4.0|This compilation will probably set better with fans of Genesis, rather than those of Steve Hackett. Read on to discover why I have this opinion. One reviewer stated that this was not a Steve Hackett album. I must disagree with that. After all, he co-wrote every song, he plays on every song, and he produced this compilation. How is that NOT a Steve Hackett album? Because the material is not original? He still owns these songs (or at least part of them). Sorry, it is still HIS work, no matter when it was originally done. OK, so let's get down to it as simple pros and cons.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  *He does not take a lot of risks here. Most songs are true to their original forms but given new instrumentation and vocals. But, on his website Steve comments: \\"On these versions I've altered the detail within the songs whilst aiming to preserve the authentic spirit of the originals.\\" So, it is not his intent to take a lot of risks. \\"On his 1996 release \\"Watcher of the Skies: Genesis Revisited\\" (GR1) he took a lot more chances by reshaping, reinterpreting and reinventing most of the songs. Examples: changing \\"I Know What I Like\\" into a jazzy bar ballad, \\"Your own Special Way\\" into a top 40 sounding pop song and changing the vocals on Dance With A Volcano and Fountain of Samalsis. On GR2 he does little of this. Some, but not a lot.<br />  *Some of the guest vocalists sound too close, or try to imitate, Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel; therefore making the songs sound almost identical to the originals. (most notably Nad Sylvan of Unifaun)<br />  *Mr. Hackett takes a bit of \\"liberty\\" with Genesis songs and includes three of his own that were penned during the Genesis years but never performed or recorded as Genesis songs. But, he did this on GR1 also. Personally, a re-recording of \\"Cinema Show\\" is missed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The pros are going to far exceed the cons.<br />  *The re-recording of these songs using todays recording standards is nothing short of superb! This alonere-invents them.<br />  *Additional and expanded instrumentation, and effects, enhances the symphonic nature of these songs.<br />  *Steve adds new and additional guitar work to every song. Whether, classical or electric it adds a new element to every song, even if the song remains fairly true to the original. Plus, his guitar work is now crystal clear as opposed to being a bit muddy on the original recordings. (Even the Genesis Re-masters do not match the sound found on GR2)He is quite simply a better guitarist now. He has more ability to do more with his guitar.<br />  *In the cases where guest vocalists do not attempt to mimic Gabriel or Collins they do manage to add an element of freshness to the songs. Steven Wilson's (Porcupine Tree) vocals on Can Utility and the Coastliners\\" is fantastic. Having female vocalist Amanda Lehman sing on \\"Ripples\\" and \\"Shadow of the Hierophant\\" actually does lend to a re-interpretation of these songs. All singers are top notch so no song is vocally weak.<br />  *Likewise, all the musicians are master class. You really get to hear some fantastic players recreating these songs.<br />  *New intensity and vibrancy is given to many older songs. Two Genesis standards \\"Suppers Ready\\" and \\"Musical Box\\" both are given much more powerful instrumentation and vocals. The urgency and power of the final movement on \\"Musical Box\\" will blow you away. I cranked it up and was playing air guitar like a 17 year old!<br />  *I was a bit concerned when I saw that Return of the Giant Hogweed was being performed by Neal Morse and Roine Stolt (Flower Kings) as they have both been covering this song on Transatlantic, Agents of Mercy, and solo tours. It is getting to be a bit overdone and I was worried it would be nothing new. But, Roine and Steve add a new guitar part, that branches off from the original and goes in a bit of a different direction by changing up the tempo and structure a bit.  This now makes \\"Return\\" a highlight of the compilation for me.<br />  *Steve preserves the entire closing movement from \\"Wind and Wuthering\\", adds new guitar elements and extends the trio of songs a bit for a great bookend to the Genesis works on the compilation. John Wetton's vocals soar on \\"Afterglow\\"!<br /><br />All in all, this is a 4 star work. To make it a 5 star would be to diminish the original Genesis works and say that this is equal to, or better, than the originals. It isn't. It's really good, but not better than the originals. It will still probably be considered one of the best prog albums of 2012, and I would agree. Genesis fans may find this more appealing than Hackett fans because the songs are more true to the originals; where Hackett fans may be disappointed because he does not experiment like he does in his current solo work or he did on GR1. Hackett seems very careful so as to not alienate die hard Genesis fans, as he may have on GR1. I still enjoy these songs immensely. These re-workings do not diminish the originals at all but manage to supply a new listening experience and freshness to these Genesis standards. If you have not checked out GR1 I strongly recommend it, especially for the Hackett aficionados. Both GR1 and 2 belong in any Genesis and Hackett music collections.<br /><br />An unsolicited comment:<br />Genesis was undoubtedly the most under rated and under appreciated group of the early to mid 70's. I had to beg people to listen to them and attend their concerts. It has taken decades for everyone to realize just how good they were. I think it might have been around the time of \\"Duke\\" that people finally began to sit up and take notice, but by then Genesis was becoming a mere shadow of what they were in the Hackett and Gabriel era, already moving to appeal to a more mainstream audience.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I'm watching the mini-series on TV and reading the book along with it is great. I love the Kindle Fire.

B009NQKXYK|4.0|Great flick, I enjoy almost all Sci Fi and this one was certainly one of the better ones. Ridley Scott tied in some of his past flicks with this one. No spoilers.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The story Martin has created is one of many twists and turns. Each chapter in this book has been a new twist and a unexpected turn, I just have to keep turning the pages.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is always an entertaining read.  This story brought the conflict in the Middle East alive as daily news reports can't.  Incredibly timely as the AQ attacks in Lybia underscore the curent, ongoing terror we must continue to fight through more effective foreign policy, government agency coordination and personal sacrifice.
B007704HO6|5.0|A truly great little read. I really enjoyed getting to know Bob. Made me feel quite humble.<br />I would recommend to anyone cat lover or not.
B0060DYMT6|5.0|A little dark and mixes up history a bit, but great performances make this very engaging retro-scifi.  Michael Cane is great as always
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I hated the first one for how badly it was written, but was convinced by some friends that the second one was better.  Fifteen pages in and I totally regretted spending the money on it. The sex became repetative and boring. I found myself flipping pages just to get to the end and when you find yourself hating the main characters, you know it ain't good! I wanted to throttle Ana. Although, I guess she would have exclaimed \\"Oh My\\" and loved me for it. I really can't understand the hype for this series.  Look elsewhere for your reading!!!
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|This review is not about the movie. It is about the 3D.  A lot of people say the 3D is very good, so I hope that mine is just defective.  I almost fell to the floor and had a grand mal seizure attack watching the blurryness of the movements.  Horrible 3D quality on the one sent to me.  No, it is not my TV and player because all my other 3D's work fine.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Never traced anything like it before! So amazingly awesome! I was in love with Travis just a chapter or so in. I highly recommend!!!
1401324649|5.0|This book will keep you guessing! Captivating story with a motley crew of characters! A must read for anyone who loves history.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not up to her usual standard. Didn't hate it but didn't love it like I usually do her books.  In places, I even wondered if Patricia Cornwell wrote the book.  Just didn't seem like her.  Too much technical stuff made it boring in places.  Wish I had seen reviews prior to buying the book, but I don't think I would have believed anything she wrote was not good.  Oh well!
B000000H57|5.0|This is my favorite album of my favorite band. A masterpiece. Never get tired of listening to these songs. Thanks Peter(R.I.P.), Johnny, Kenny and Josh for these songs that touch the soul.

B007YA5NRO|5.0|Clear and helpful! With many pictures and examples. I would suggest to everyone that own this camera. You will not need even to read the manual
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I almost didn't order this book from Amazon.  I haven't enjoyed the last few Patricia Cornwell's books, and in reviews I've read I was not alone.  I liked this book much better. The story was a good one.  The characters strong, the outcome unpredictable.  BUT a little too long and wordy.  Our story teller, as usual is Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Her medical terminology in the book is impressive, just a little tiring for many of us without a medical degree. a little of it is necessary of courseto give authenticity.  The latest technology is way out there,fascinating, and probably the envy of every pathologist in Scarpetta's field.  Cornwell always researches Scarpetta's field to the point she could probably pass board exams.  This task alone is hard to imagine and coupled with a good story and familiar characters makes it a four star earner.
B009JNXK88|5.0|Great game that plays like Super Meat Boy with more action and a cool 8-bit design at a very low $.99 price or free if you were lucky enough to get as the FAOTD very great job on the developers' work.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The characters are amazing.  Although the sexual content is intense at times, the three books are so much more.  True love does triumph.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This is another of Ms. Cornwall's great Kay Scarpeta mysteries. I always enjoy her books with combinations of a mystery and interpersonal relationships.
B002W7P5UE|5.0|Hitchcock is a master, I think we can all agree onthat.  He exceeds where others fail in telling stories.  His narrative is concise and always keeps you guessing and NbyNW is his shining example.  This is, in my opinion, the best suspense film ever made.  Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are top notch, as is the rest of the cast.  If you haven't seen this gem before, please check it out, you won't be disappointed.
1452111014|5.0|Maggie Malone, director of development at Walt Disney Animated Studios, delivers a behind-the-scenes look at Disney's new animated epic. I could not wait for the movie to come out, and watched it yesterday with my daughter. We are huge Disney fans, and found this movie as fascinating as several other Disney movies. We have been collecting Disney Movies for 20 years, traveled from New York to Florida to Disney World 8 times, and also enjoyed Disneyland in California. 'Wreck-it Ralph' is another bit hit, and to me a classic. The story is amazing, extremely funny, and fascinating. I'm glad we saw the movie first, because this book is additional excitement and fun-filled. The author includes breathtaking paintings, character sketches, storyboards, and much more. This book is indeed as Entertaining as the movie, and the Disney animation is Breathtaking. The colorful characters come to life, and the movie is absolutely Fantastic. I agreed with my daughter that the illustrations for this movie are as Beautiful as those in 'Toy Story!' We found the movie to be exquisite, and we certainly will watch it again-and-again, and will purchase the DVD for our Disney collection. This book is 160 pages of pure joy for video game, Disney, and animated lovers. Enjoyable and Highly Recommended!
B008JH5CVS|1.0|Terrible movie. The idea is interesting and would make for a great action film, but it was obviously produced on a low budget. The movie is thrown together. The story is not given time to develop and the film jumps around. Not worth your time.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie I thought had really great potential. Without giving any spoilers, this movie gave the illusion of being much more exciting. there were really great actors and i felt they were really underused. So you could have had any other actors in these roles. Charlize character is somewhat cold, emotionless. Nothing memorable about the movie other than it could have been better. Its one of those movies where, after you watch it, you find yourself wondering why the \\"big names\\" in the movie took the role. What attracted them to it. The idea is fantastic and the trailer made it look soooo exciting. But it could have been more indepth, more exciting. For instance the movie Alien wouldn't have been any fun if you didn't see the alien ... not that you don't see anything, but there could have been more. Just sort of fell flat.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|This third book was definitely the best one, it had a real story to it instead of being locked in the red room or bedroom all the time !!!
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|Tim curry looks great the more make up he wears. What a devil. Craving eternal night and sipping bloody marys. Magical elf people meddling in others affairs. Mia sara yummy
B008N5UX9M|4.0|First off, I'm not an Iron Maiden fan so maybe I can be an impartial listener to this album as so many others have really bashed this so-called \\"solo\\" effort by Steve Harris.  From reading the reviews it seems everyone wanted a Steve Harris release in the vein of Iron Maiden.  if that's the case why would Steve Harris even bother releasing a solo effort???  With that said, regardless of his input or collaboration on this record, I, for one am thoroughly enjoying it.  For me, this is a straight ahead rock album and doesn't disappoint.  But, that's me and everything is subjective to every listener.  While I always say each release should be reviewed based on its own merits and not compared to previous, reviewers here are comparing this release to prior Iron Maiden releases and I find that pretty unfair.  I'm not finding the weakness in the vocalist because, at times, you could say that about a ton of vocalists out there.  Bottom line, this is a great release if you can get around your per-conceived thoughts as to what this should have sounded like.
B009JNXK88|2.0|It's all the same. Play one level, play the next, they all look the same. Four or five levels and the fun is gone. What's the point? Zzzzzzzzzz
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it works great w/ my kindle fire and I love that it'll read to you. I am very glad that I got it a recoomend it to all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The whole collection was deep on many levels.  Yes, the sexual content was out there, but a lesson to all couples.  If reading to your partner I found that some desires afraid of discussing presented itself.  Marriage even with children can still be mind blowing.  In a world of divorces this should be the book therapist use!  Read beyond just the sex, you'll be glad to think this one out.
B005PK553C|4.0|A really different show that will rock your world with its twisty storyline and great editing. I didn't expect much when I bought this but I like scary stuff. It proved to be so much more than just another \\"horror\\" story.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|This was my first foray into the culinary world, but it didn't disappoint.  Anthony Bourdain takes the reader through the ins and outs of the restaurant industry, providing a great deal of insight into the business.  Bourdain focuses mainly on his own journey, from his humble beginnings working in a kitchen during one summer in the 1970s to becoming a world class chef by 2000.  I found his writing style engaging and down-to-earth, and his description of an unknown and seemingly boring subculture was great.  Its simply a description you can't find anywhere else, and Bourdain has a good story to tell.  He also gives his share of advice and insight, such as when not to order fish in a restaurant, the lingo of the restaurant business, and even tips on equipment the layman should buy to enhance their kitchen.  If I have a complaint about the book, its that some sections of his story are a bit superfluous (there's a weird description of a trip to Japan at the end) and his \\"bad boy\\" image may be a bit overdone.  Overall, it is a great book and one that I would recommend to anyone.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Where do I even start? I understand that everything in a film can't be accurate, but there are so many things wrong with this movie, I can't even begin to remember them all. Is it really necessary to just change the story like this?<br />In an attempt to educate those of you who are unfamiliar with Tudor history, I will try to outline the many inaccuracies of this movie.<br /><br />1. Anne is in fact younger than Mary. I can only assume that their ages were reversed in the film to make Mary appear like the oppressed younger sister.<br /><br />2. Mary was not an angel. She was in fact called a prostitute before she even came to Henry because of her exploits with the French king.<br /><br />3. Henry was interested in Mary first, NOT Anne, as the film implies. Anne was very young at the time her sister first started her affair with Henry.<br /><br />4. Henry did not \\"rape\\" Anne. Why on earth would he go to such great extents to respect her wishes to remain pure before marriage and not have sex with her only to ruin all of that in the end by completely disrespecting her.<br /><br />5. Catherine of Aragon's representation in this film made me ill. She looks like a stuck up old bitch. I didn't feel sorry for her at all (which made me sad because she is quite a tragic figure). She was also a strong woman, and this movie makes her look woefully insecure. Don't even get me started on the mole...very distracting.<br /><br />6. We can be 99.999% sure that George and Anne did not even attempt to have sex with each other. This was just part of Henry's propaganda to justify getting rid of Anne, and apparently the creators of this film have fallen for it.<br /><br />7. This isn't an inaccuracy so much as an annoyance. Henry pretty much starts hating Anne right after he gets married to her. After trying for years to get her, you'd think he'd be happy with her for at least a little while.<br /><br />8. Anne supposedly had five lovers (including her brother) according to Henry. All (except for George) were left out of the story. How can you blatantly leave out 4 people??! I understand the time restrictions, but honestly, if they would have spent a little less time on stupid crap (like that hunting scene where Henry gets hurt) and a little more time on stuff that ACTUALLY HAPPENED, maybe then they could have included it.<br /><br />9. What is with Henry promising Mary that he'll free Anne at the end?? This is YET ANOTHER ATTEMPT to make Mary look like the good, poor, put-upon, little sister *barf*.<br /><br />10. Elizabeth is supposed to be almost 3 years old at the time of her mother's death, but she still looks like a baby at the end of the film.<br /><br />11. Mary actually had two children, a girl (born first), and then a boy. It is questionable whether they were even Henry's kids.<br /><br />12. Oh yes...Cromwell and Wolsey...where were they??! I can't believe two such important historical figures who were instrumental in Henry's divorce were completely ignored and left out of this movie. Unbelievable. Would it really have been so hard to at least just mention them???<br /><br />There were other things, but I can't remember them all right now, and I haven't watched the film in a while. This film had good potential, but the story was mutilated and the script was dreadful. I love Eric Bana and Natalie Portman, but I HATED them in this film. I am very sorry to everyone who knows nothing about the Tudors and then goes to see this film. Far too many people take it at face value and come out spewing all kinds of crap about how \\"evil\\" Anne was and how Henry should never have \\"raped\\" her. This movie should definitely be called The Other Boleyn Girl: A Story Vaguely Based on History.except for George) were left out of the story. How can you blatantly leave out 4 people??!

B008LSVL6U|5.0|This video is one of the best i´ve ever seen. The quality of sound and video is outstanding  and the editing is perfect. Steven Wilson es the most important musician nowdays, no other has accomphish this level in the last 20 years. This is a jewel !
B009NPM5Y2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Lots of good music and a decent story line. I would recommend it to anyone well almost anyone little kids would not be interested.
0393338398|3.0|Let me first start off by saying I am a big Michael Lewis fan.  \\"The Big Short\\" and \\"Liar's Poker\\" are two great books in my opinion.  That said, I found \\"Moneyball\\" lacking their depth and energy.  I bought the book after absolutely loving the movie, which was fantastic.  I found that the book jumped around an awful lot (and I read it quickly), making it difficult to follow. At some point, I was just wanting Lewis to get back to the story of the Oakland A's and finish over-analyzing Bill James and the dry history of baseball statistics.  Seeing as how the book is about baseball, this may be my fault, but I ultimately thought that Lewis just put way too much importance into a somewhat meaningless subject.  Even still, some of the facts were interesting here- such as the importance of on base and slugging percentage in relation to traditional statistics- however his delivery simply wasn't that good and I found myself losing interest.  His writing has been far better in his other works.  I would have thought this book was written by some random, mediocre sportswriter had I not known it was by Lewis.<br /><br />Overall, the book was okay, and I bought it cheap.  I certainly did learn a few things.  That being said, the movie was far more entertaining and well done.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend \\"Moneyball\\" unless someone is a baseball or statistics fanatic.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|The best part of this book was the insight into what it took to actually make Duran Duran happened. I'm impressed with Taylor's memory of events and his honesty towards himself and his parents. Looking at the MTV videos from the 80s and the 90s it was impossible to tell that the man was in that much pain. I understand that he is still an integral member of the band but I'm a little disheartened by his refusal to go into details about what happened between D2 and the Barrow brothers. Additionally he didn't go into any detail about the reunion and Andy Taylor or the fiasco that was \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\". The last third of the book seemed very rushed, although it had its moments especially with Taylor dealing with his parents. All in all this was a great book in conjunction with Andy Taylor's book and answered some questions about the start of D2.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Well acted, unpredictable and worth the fee for a rental. Amazon has all of the latest movies and I can save money by staying home pop my own corn and watch them from my recliner and have my happy little dogs on my lap. I save an average of $20.00 per movie
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow! The hunger games is the best series ever. I wish there were more to the series but there's nothing to add to this perfect series. The hunger games will be something I'll ask my children, grandchildren, and great grand children to read. Now let's just wait for the other movies
B008OOYALE|5.0|great game lots of fun and its free which is even better. the dragons are fun and cute. highly recommended.
B007H1HQW0|1.0|If you are thinking about buying a glass cutter, DONT BUY THIS ONE! I was so excited after I read the other reviews and thought for sure this one would work.  I was wrong.  After trying on about 20+ different bottles, I ended up with 20+ shattered bottles from this cheaply made product.  I am still looking for one that works correctly and am sorely disappointed in this purchase.
B00932A6G4|1.0|I didn't realize I was renting a cartoon. I want my money back!!! I'm sorry, I just couldn't watch it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great on my Android device! I haven't found any flaws with this app. It is efficient and easy to use. I highly recommend this App!
B00178JDCK|3.0|I put 3 new batteries in, and it still pulsates red. - (low battery indication). Maybe this is going back.<br />I do not like the way you have to access the battery to change it either. You have to carry an impliment, like a ball point pen, to push in the spring loaded hinge points. That'll get old fast.  However, the sounds it produces with an AC/dc wall wart are acceptable.
B0064O927I|5.0|I love thus watch, I have always had crappy watches that last a while but I wanted something better. So, I bought this because I went to a swatch store a while ago and the employee helped me pick one that fit my needs, big screen, waterproof, digital, and not that expensive. I was showed how to operate the watch from the sales person so when I got it off amazon I knew how to work it and the instructions that come with it are basically what I was told. I hope this helps make your decision.
B005SZADQS|5.0|wow.i was too scared to finish it. sorry.<br />yeas i believe the critics are right but i was just taken back from it a little.<br />thanks and the quality was great.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is an Awesome app. It's really fun and makes it easy to keep going without becoming too monotonous. Yay!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Love this show, it is super creepy! Watching season two now, I will be buying that when it is released.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This quirky film gushes with charm. It is a love story with awkward but charming moments of two misfit children tasting the forbidden fruits for the first time. It is an adventure story with a feel that reminds me of My Father's Dragon. Most of all, it is a story that informs us of the beauty of the human experience.
0810993139|5.0|i had to get another one since one of the kids lost it. it arrived so quick and just in time for a book report. and i ordered the new one as well.<br />thanks again
B0026NZR98|5.0|I loved this film, especially the Wilson character, played by Barack Obama.  At some point, you just have to leave your delusions behind.
B009FZZK8I|3.0|While it is interesting to see the detail behind the special effects, there are only so many ways you can show gore-splattered zombies before its gets boring.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The second enstallment was a little overly dramtic, but still steamy and a quick, fun read. Looking forward to the next one.
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|yes i watched it again. just to get ready for pt 2. it looked and sounded great. thanks new kindle fire hd.
B005LVR6ZA|3.0|This is not a book for the casual reader.  I've made it about half way through and don't think that I can finish it.  I would typically give a book like this two stars, but it does have a some intriguing qualities.  The descriptions of the characters are fascinating and the life of future (1990) is interesting in a back-to-the-future sort of way that can cause one to think about the limits of projecting our knowledge into the unknown of the future.  However, the plot is often impenetrable and the language is confusing.  I can see where this could be the basis for a great movie after it is completely rewritten by a scriptwriter.
B004OR1XGK|5.0|I'm reading this every day. It's a really great book, well written, clear and to the point. It contains tons of handy tidbits, anecdotes about software creation, architecture and design. I'd recommend this book to friends and colleagues alike!
0316228532|5.0|They would have enlisted Sherwood Anderson and produced A Casual Vacancy.  JK Rowlings has captured Trollope's detailed and precise analysis of provincial British life and combined it with the mordent cynacism of Sainclair Lewis' trenchent study of self-satisfied,small minded, small town Americans who in Babbit grapple as ineffectively with personal and social issues as the residents of Rowlings self deluding small town.  This proves she can write for adults even when the real focus of her story are the children, struggling through adolescence, vulnerable, and as agents creating the tragic story arc that leads to unpleasant truths, tattered relationships, self awareness, and death.  This  isn't hogwarts and the ending is bleak and unsettling.  Her individual portraits rival Sherwood Anderson's masterful collection of grotestiques that he created in Winesburg Ohio.  Each is sharply drawn and their fobiles and failures clearly drawn.  Krystal, of course, is the real and tragic heroine of the story.  She is the Hary Potter-Hermoine surrogate, fighting the dark forces of the adult world and because this is an adult novel, losing catastrophically.
0374214913|2.0|I waited and waited for this book to come out, and I have to say that this was not at all what I expected, much of it was an amage to Google, and the websites surrounding it. Much of the book did not make any sense, and it was very hard to really follow, I usually say that debut novels (if they are not the my liking) are a decent acheviement, but this one was just not there for me. I did not feel for any of the characters at all, and close to the end, I could not wait to finish this disaster. If Mr Sloan does come out with another book, and not be a one trick pony, I still would not spend my money or my time in reading his material.<br /><br />Christopher Berry
B008OIQYTG|5.0|This is a great collection of tunes - hearing this disc got me to go out and purchase Zamajobe albums (she's great!).  Lee always manages to collect tremendous talent on his records.  This one is highly recommended, particularly if you're already a Lee fan.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much and did not anticipate the ending until near the very last pages. It is a haunting story and one that keeps popping back into my mind. Well done overall.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I was engaged from the first book to the last book with each chapter seeming to end on a twist.  A very fast paced, confronting and enthralling read - would read them again.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An amazing adventure. I couldn't stop reading it! Worth every cent. As a Brazilian I should say the book is not a copy of Max and the Tigers, from Brazilian author Scliar.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Definitely a great sequel to Beautiful Creatures. Lena and Ethan's relationship is strained by a new character, Liv. Lena must make a choice, a choice she didn't know she could make.this choice will change life in Gatlin forever.<br /><br />Death, fear and love bring the reader into this story, causing them to furiously turning the pages.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|It's as good as the theatre but now in your home! Sound quality with a home theatre system brings quality entertainment home.
B0053O89YM|5.0|The first year was a great introduction to all the characters.  The second year dragged a bit.  The third year was awesome!!!  The characters are still evolving, and I love watching on dvd.
0679882820|5.0|What else can you say, What else can you say, another great book as always from Dr. Seuss. Great addition for our little ones collection.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I cant seem to get this app to install onto my kindle fire, I need help. my credit card seems to be fine, but wont download.
B008G12ERC|3.0|Muse is a very talented band and they have a very eclectic taste in music.  On the 2nd Law they incorporate a number of different styles and sounds, however, the album as a whole does not flow that smoothly.  The beginning track \\"Supremacy\\" kicks things off with a simple two note pattern on guitar and then erupts into horns when they reach the chorus, and it will surely remind you of Led Zeppleins \\"Kashmir\\".  The next track \\"Madness\\" is done wonderfully well with its slow build to the big finish.  \\"Panic Station\\" keeps picks up the pace and has a funky groove throughout which will surely make you want to dance, after this is where the album loses its way.  \\"Survival\\" is a an uptempo rock song that will remind you of older Muse songs, but the lyrics are just awful, here is a sample, \\"lifes a race and I am going to win cause i choose to survive\\", I just think that is a little childish to be on an album.  I don't particularly like \\"Follow Me\\" too dub-steppy.  \\"Animals\\" decent track with good guitar work. \\"Explorers\\" slows it down and is relaxing song.  Then the rest of the album is just so-so.  The 2 songs Wolstenholme sings on aren't bad they just don't offer anything to be memorable. Then the last 2 are just Muse wanting to be a dub-step or techno band.  I think they should forget about that and focus on the guitar, bass, and drums.  I mean they are soooo talented at those why don't they just figure out new things with those, instead of incorporataing things that they aren't good at?  Overall this album is OK, but I would like to see them go back to the sound of \\"Black Holes\\" or \\"Absolution\\".  With that all said they are the best live band I have ever see and I am hoping when I see them in Chicago on March 4th some of views on these songs will change.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|A fantastic film.  I like having it on instant video, too, since I can access the film from so many devices I own.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What else can one say. This is a great CD. Adele has such a beautiful voice. I can listen to this over and over and want to keep listening to it.
0143038419|4.0|So much more back story than the movie & a lot more drama.  A great complement to the movie, very touching and spiritual.
B008B450G6|5.0|I started watching the series on Netflix this past month, but when I finished the seasons they had I had to look for the season 3 episodes elsewhere. Amazon was the best place to get them! The picture is great and the sound is even better than Netflix. Buying from Amazon will also save you $1 each episode instead of buying from iTunes!
B009NQKXYK|1.0|My husband and I sat through about 40 minutes of this movie....how we endured that long I cannot say.  My son was the only one to finish the movie.
0316017930|5.0|This book is different from the type of book I usually read but I really enjoyed the book.  Outliers is a book about the reasons some people are successful in life or not successful. The date when a person is born, the 10,000 hour rule, Jewish lawyers and their success in the 70's and 80's, air plane pilots and the country in which they were born are all some of the outliers which the author discusses in full.  What the book really does is make you look at your own life and wonder how your successes and failures are tied to things in which you had no control. I strongly urge everyone to read this book.  It will keep your interest and make you think.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The app works just like the website. It allows me to review videos, pictures and tag people just like accessing the website on a computer.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|The quality was good.  Easy to order through my PS3.  Kids love the chance they got to view it.  Great for the holiday.  No problems with the service.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|We saw the oroginal cast in London and this is almost the same as being there.  A sumptuous production with excellent performers and music that is so thrilling.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|From the moment you open the first page, DeMille has you captured.  He has done his homework on the story line and presents it in a fashion that you cannot leave it alone.  John Corey, his character of many books, is so described, that you know almost what he looks like.  You do have to be into current times and world affairs because he does come close to home with this book.  Recommend reading it highly..
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent  It referenced the first in the series without going in to long recaps.  If one hadn't read the first book, this would still stand on its own
B0098VXE50|5.0|This Item (along with several others), arrived before the delivery date. I LOVE the movie. It compares strongly with Kristen being in the movie 'Twilight'. She and the other actors never disappoint. This movie is good enough to be a series. I've watched it several times already and can watch it many, many more.
0385342063|5.0|I love this book! It was such a fun read, from beginning to end. I had trouble putting it down.  A must purchase if you are looking for a fun and entertaining read!
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Wow can't wait for next part shame I have to wait until may to read it why can't we have it earlier
B0090O07RS|2.0|There is something wrong with this disc, and the one I sent back for which this is a replacement.<br />Same thing again: skipping and freezing in various spots, the exact same spots in fact. A small pit in the disc surface about 7/16\\" from the outer<br />edge can be seen in both the discs I had. There was a problem in the manufacturing (duplicating) process, and perhaps Amazon<br />has a vast batch of these bad clones. Customers beware. No, it's not my player. I have three Blueray players from different manufacturers, and I have tried all of them. I don't know what I will do yet...
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I LOVE JOHNNY DEPP'S MOVIES. After 'the Tourist' and all of the 'Pirates of the Carribeans', I didn't think he could make anything better. He's so surreal! I have ALL of his movies. Barnabas Collins has Nothing on him! The DVD arrived in time for a week-end jam with my younger cousins ages 9-43. The movie got everyone's attention and you could hear a pin drop when they weren't laughing. Perfect movie....Thanks.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|This is a 'must read' for anyone interested in really understanding how the spirit integrates with the physical. I so enjoyed it that I know I will read it again and again.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|The Kids loved it there is just enough action mixed with humor. Two Thumbs up from our 9 year old!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|works exactly as it should and announces when the battery is fully charged which is one of the best features of this app... download this app you will not be disappointed.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|This is online for free, but I wanted a physical copy since I enjoy having the actual CDs in my possession if possible. Plus, this came with a few codes for Steam; one code for a few items in Team Fortress, and the other for a copy of DOTA 2. I like it when companies release music for their games, and include a bonus for buying it. The music is the usual high quality of a regular CD bought from a store. I really enjoyed Portal 1 and 2, and the music being put onto a physical set that comes with a few extra goodies is nice to have, especially from Valve since they seem like they are one of the few companies left to actually take their time on all their products (Half-Life 3 anyone?) Overall, this is another item for my collection that I am satisfied and excited to have. Some people complained that when they received it, it was busted up. Mine came in a bubblewrap tight packaging with cardboard on the back, and the shipping info on the front. The packaging felt solid, but it made me have to use scissors on the plastic for the shipping packaging because it was wrapped so tightly that pulling on it made the casing creak and shift around (which isnt good for the plastic jewel case.) My one and only problem was with Amazon sending it two days after it released, but they made up for it with it arriving two days earlier than the promised date. Worth the $15 I spent on this, and would definitely pre-purchase something like this again if they release another music collection compiled of the quality music from their games.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Engrossing. Doesn't take itself too seriously. Fun. Gore, but not excessive.The stars all do a great job, especially Mischa Auer as a befuddled angel. Over-arching plot is complicated, but you can jump in anywhere and get the gist. Great entertainment.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|Easy to maneuver, great presentation.  Fun to have so many cities instantly available without a lot of moving back & forth in the program.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is a great, fast moving,action packed book.  It is hard to put down once you start reading. It was my first ebook and it works great.
B001CZVVVE|5.0|A masterpiece in all aspects, great orchestration and magnificent voices, Elina and Anna caught my heart! Would highly recommend it
B0083P1QUM|1.0|She apparently loves to flaunt her lifestyle these days. This is like having a tooth pulled without a pain killer.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I play this game everyday for about an hour. I,love trying to beat my own self and the challenge of trying to feed everyone before they gets angry!!!!
B007QRKM6M|5.0|Love this show...so creative. Very family friendly...nice to see something so well known with a twist that can be watched by all ages. Enjoying season 2 now!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I've read every one of Nelson's books and look forward in anticipation to each new one. Given the recent fiasco in Libya, this new story couldn't be any more timely.<br /><br />As usual with his stories, once started, this book was hard to put down. My only reservation, my reason to not give it 5 stars, was the length of the book. It seems to take a long time to finally build up to what you knew was ultimately going to happen. I prefer a few more surprising twists and turns to keep one guessing....a little more suspense would be appreciated!<br /><br />Having said that, I still heartily recommend this book!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you Google Dr. Eben Alexander III you find that he has credentials pages long as a respected neurosurgeon and medical academic.  He, like many of us technically trained folks, found it hard to truly believe religious concepts like prayer to a God, spiritual entities, and life after death.  However, also like some of us, life dealt him a blow which resulted in a life changing spiritual experience. I read this book eagerly searching for similarities with my own encounter years ago, which turned me from a confirmed agnostic to a serious believer. Dr. Alexander's experience was much more severe and extensive than my own, but had enough similarities that I have probably have less trouble than some in believing that his story is true.<br /><br />The initiator of his encounter was a severe case of bacterial meningitis, an often fatal disease which damaged the outer cortex of his brain, putting him in a coma for seven days. His body became unresponsive, requiring a ventilator to keep it alive, but according to his later account, his consciousness or spirit remained active, and was taken out of the body through what the religious would call the heavenly realm. The journey seemed to include three levels that he later named as follows: 1.The underworld, a transparent mud-like space through which he rose until he encountered: 2. the Gateway, an entry to a land that looked like a more beautiful version of the World. He sailed above this land accompanied by a beautiful young woman (later found to be a deceased sister whom he had never met), finally approaching 3. The Core, \\"an immense void, infinite in size, pitch black but also brimming over with light\\" (I quote this because it did not make sense to me - apparently our linear brains cannot comprehend something being two things at once). In this place he was accompanied by an \\"orb\\" which interpreted the messages to his consciousness from the Creator, who seemed to completely surround this space. He felt as though he were in a \\"giant cosmic womb\\". He learned many things there. Some he could not explain in human language, such as the meaning of science's newly discovered \\"dark energy\\" and \\"dark mass\\". Three important messages he could explain were received shortly after he arrived: 1. \\"You are loved and cherished.\\" 2. \\"You have nothing to fear.\\" 3.\\"There is nothing you can do wrong.\\" He was told there are many universes. Evil is present in small amounts in all of them to allow the possibility of making the free will choices necessary for progression of the species, but love is overwhelmingly dominant. From the higher worlds one could access the lesser worlds at any time or place. To me, this all sounded like a combination of religious beliefs and science speculation. Yet, it did seem possible.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander suddenly woke up from his coma and after a long convalescence, regained his full mental facilities and began to write down his experiences. As a brain specialist and scientist he realized as much as anyone how farfetched it all sounded. He subsequently reviewed the physiology carefully, investigating nine possible physical explanations for the phenomenon he experienced. All had to be rejected, leaving his only conclusion that a person's consciousness exists outside the body in the heavenly realms and resides only temporarily in the body during its short period on earth. Dr. Alexander believes that this happened to him for a reason and that he is called to bring his experience to the attention of his fellow humans. Crazy as my summary might sound; this is not a crazy person. His book is well written, fascinating to read, and it certainly expanded my thinking about that part of life which is death.<br /><br />One final comment: I doubt if \\"Proof of Heaven\\" was Dr. Alexander's original title; it looks more like a publisher's idea. As a scientist, Dr. Alexander knows that this book is not a proof of heaven, it is only one more piece of evidence that life may be more than just a body.ody.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A delightful mix of the midevil and current technological age.  Old witchcraft mixed in with new.  Great read for bookclub.
0385535147|5.0|I've been harsh on Grisham novels of late but that trend is changing with this latest work.  Grisham breaks out new scenarios and subject matter in this book along with another annoying trait in recent past novels being omitted: Rushing the story to the finish line.  I don't have the time right now to go into all the particulars but suffice to say, for one who has read EVERY Grisham writing over the past two decades, The Racketeer ranks for me among his very best.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Best book yet, can't wait for the third one to come out.  still have about 1/3 left to read, but with the power outage here in NJ I could not recharge my kindle for a few days now b usy trying to get back to almost normal no time to ready.  but will finish as soon as  I can.  Love this book and all others by Ken Follett
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Good little story about what it really means to be \\"elderly.\\"  It gives one pause about this last phase of life.
1449410243|3.0|First, the book is hilarious. If you know The Oatmeal and read the website regularly, it's not a bad purchase given the low price. But be forewarned that 75% of the content in the book is taken from old comics posted online. Very little original, previously unseen content in here. Good to lay on the coffee table as a conversation piece, I suppose.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Overall a good film, but it left me with more questions than plot line.  Maybe in the sequel...  A bit more on the engineers, why where they running, pile of bodies?, act...
B008XG1X18|4.0|great app. lots of fun ideas. I'm a teacher and when I need ideas I come here for crafts and more.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This games is ok if you can get it for free but if you have to pay for I would not because you sometimes have to spend money on credits to get somthings
B001AQMBL4|5.0|Will and the rest of the cast are just down right hilarious. I love this movie for just pure fun.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I got this as a gift for my boyfriend. He likes it so that makes me happy!<br /><br /> three more words
B008PPUMVY|5.0|I enjoyed this album from the start. There zappa for everyone. inspired the most. The sound of this remaster is amazing, like a disc recorded these days. For those who do not know zappa, the best approach. For Zappa fans, a new way of approaching a genius in another of her amazing art demonstrations. I have the album on vinyl since 1979 and this is the third edition on cd I bought.<br />Definitely one of the best records ever.<br /><br />Marcelo
B000TU16GS|5.0|Good book<br />Reading the whole entire series It had a lot of action in it I rated this book 5 stars
B004AQR24W|3.0|Good thing this was free when i watched it because I would not pay to see this. There is a reason why stallone doesnt makes movies. The plot sucked and the acting was mediocre. I did enjoy the fight scenes but the was overall was pretty stupid
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is a great weekend read.  Its an action packed mystery that had me glued to the story for the most part of the weekend<br />Its a quick and enjoyable read. There is a bit of violence but nothing that I would consider out of league for teens and above.
B0096HIEE2|4.0|This movie is pretty much what you would (and should) expect. No great story line, but the eye candy is good enough to keep it moving and fairly entertaining. The dance scenes with Channing Tatum are the best and I wish that there was more of him dancing. I've always loved him and he has still got the moves. So if you in the mood for some fun, mindless, entertainment, I think you'll enjoy it.
B000NY12LO|5.0|While Nineteen Minutes is a totally fictional account of bullying and a school shooting it is a must read for all parents.  I would also highly recommend it for teenage children.  I think almost every parent and every kid can identify with at least one of  the characters in the book and therefore \\"see\\" bullying from a unique perspective.  There is no justification for the school shooting and the author does not attempt to do this.  Instead she focuses on how the main character got to the point, how he lost contact with reality and the effect on himself and those surrounding him.  It is a moving book.  One of Jodi's best to this point.  Her writing has evolved into a much easier read while maintaining the depth of the story.
B001O5114O|4.0|Appaloosa is in a class few Westerns achieve in depicting the gritty reality of what it truly must have been like in the late 19th century west. Open Range is in the same class. The two principal characters in both films could really be the same people. Appaloosa has one distinct advantage: the crisp, bare-bones dialogue of Robert B. Parker; although, the genius of Parker's dialogue is more easily appreciated in the book than in the film.
B005PK553C|5.0|The way this entire season unfolds is something to keep you going- tying up the loose ends in episodes that you haven't seen yet. Great writing, and shared directing by some folks who know what they are doing. Great casting- Jessica Lange is at the top of her game in this series! Personally, this twisted dark-side show ranks right up there with Breaking Bad.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Well nothing much to say about a CPU. But it works. Stock cooler that comes with it is inadequate and should be discarded and replaced with a decent cooler. It is fast, my ASUS bios says it does not support hyper-threading. Not a big deal. It overclocks well. Overall a great a buy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|just started game so far everything is cool but you run out of diamonds fast other wise I am enjoying the game
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I think, though, that a bit more time could have been spent in developing the main character [played by Ewan McGregor]. He seemed a delightfully sensitive and introspective character, so I would have appreciated more embellishment.<br /><br />Wonderfully done, though.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This starts out with a very intense mystery unraveling in the ocean and a huge endangered species is involved.  Amazing detail on the process which again proves Dr. Scarpetta is quite a determined woman.  It's keeps you guessing and wondering throughout.  Exciting, intense and a real page turner!
B007G51UV0|4.0|I have build a new system using this motherboard and worked like charm from get go. BIOS and the asus ai utility could be better. Windows 7 did not recognize all of the devices on the board so i had to use the cd that came with the package. It has Intel Gigabyte NIC which is a plus, but win7 (w/o the SP1 doesnt have the driver) so be prepared. Also manual is lacking some information about where/how to connect the eSATA cable (from the add-on bracket) on the board. Unlike other boards, this one doesnt have any eSATA connection. However you can connect it to any one of the SATA terminals (use a 3GB/s ones, as eSATA standard doesnt support 6GB/s).<br /><br />It does not have a firewire connection. If this is important for you.<br /><br />CPU is positioned too close to the memory modules, so a good heatsink/fan like cooler master evo will block the 1st memory slot. If you are going to populate all of the memory slots and not planning to use Intel stock heatsink, then go for low profile memory modules. It worked well with G-Skill ripjaws at 1600. Software that controls the fans isnt that great however.<br /><br />Plenty of fan controls on the board 4 chase fans + 2 CPU fans. 2 ASMEDIA SATA 6GB/s + 2 Intel z77 SATA 6Gb/s connections are also adequate for most users.<br /><br />Now the negatives:<br />* 2nd PCI express x1 slot is too close to the PCI express x16 slot for the GPU, that makes it effectively useless for those of us installing decent vga cards.<br />* CPU opt fan control does not control the speed of the fan (or perhaps it is problem in my setup)<br />* CPU is located too close to the memory slots.<br />* associated cd driver and utility disk is full of ads/unnecessary stuff (not as bad as the creative labs products but still a pain. browser add was located under the driver tab and i had to install everything manually to avoid picking junk/software.<br />* there is no heatpipe connection between the cooler sitting on top of the Z77 and the other heatsinks.  Z77 does get a bit hot.<br /><br />Overall I think it is still a good buy and i would recommend.<br /><br /> ASUS P8Z77-V PRO LGA 1155 Intel Z77<br /> Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - CPU Cooler with 120mm PWM Fan<br /> G.SKILL 8GB (2 x 4GB) Ripjaws X Series DDR3 1600MHz 240-Pin PC3-12800 Desktop Memory F3-12800CL9D-8GBXL<br /> Intel Core i5-3570K Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 4 Core LGA 1155 - BX80637I53570K<br /> cooler master haf x<br /> Seagate Barracuda 7200 3 TB<br /> samsung ssd 830 256gb<br /> WD Black 1TB7 does get a bit hot.<br /><br />Overall I think it is still a good buy and i would recommend.<br /><br /> ASUS P8Z77-V PRO LGA 1155 Intel Z77<br /> Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO - CPU Cooler with 120mm PWM Fan<br /> G.SKILL 8GB (2 x 4GB) Ripjaws X Series DDR3 1600MHz 240-Pin PC3-12800 Desktop Memory F3-12800CL9D-8GBXL<br /> Intel Core i5-3570K Quad-Core Processor 3.4 GHz 4 Core LGA 1155 - BX80637I53570K<br /> cooler master haf x<br /> Seagate Barracuda 7200 3 TB<br /> samsung ssd 830 256gb<br /> WD Black 1TB
B004EBZX6W|4.0|With this gaget am able to check my equipment performance and the range of my signal.<br />Takes the guess out of the equation.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|If you like 80's hair rock and references galore - this movie is for you.  Soundtrack is solid, performances are classic and the hidden references rock on.  As for a plot.  Just enjoy the music and references of rocks \\"second\\" golden age!
B002SSBD6W|3.0|Its very insightful and made me eat meat only once a week. And I no longer eat sausages or ham. Just pure beef for one day a week.<br /><br />Except for all of the hateful and one sided opinions and lack of scientific explanations about \\"humans don't need to eat meat\\" argument, it shows chicken and pig farms with all of their cruelty.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Been using this stuff for years on all the systems I build.  Very easy and clean to use and there is a huge difference in CPU temperature when I don't use it and when I do.
0345803507|5.0|This is a series I heard about and I cant put it down  Finished first 2 working on 3rd  Books here always arrive quickly and cant wait for next series on these ppl
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Story had greater potential than what what presented. But... still enteraining enough movie. Go ahead ad watch this one. Better than most.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a cool book. It took a while to get the drift of what was happening, but then the story took off. Realistic?  I didn't think so.  Interesting? Definitely. If you want to read something rather strange, this is it. It isn't a run of the mill story. By the end of the book, you want to read more.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|While its really cool, it does slow down my computer after I disconnect. I got this for free a long time ago but only bought it because its usually 15 dollars. Never used until now. Fun to prank little brother
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Usually love DeMille's work but found The Panther was too much talk, not enough action.  I understand setting up characters, situations, background, etc. but this book took most of its pages just letting John Corey exercise his satiric wit.  While he is funny and I do get a good chuckle from some of his comments, this was too much of a good thing.  Better luck next time.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Thought the premise was a bit far fetched!! Why would anyone agree to take this job?  Also, taking Kate along made no sense.
1608862771|5.0|I first discovered his blog by following an image link through google and I've been hooked ever since. This is simple, unadulterated sketching perfection, with a creative mind to match the skill demonstrated with ink and brush. Mattias Adolfsson is a genius, buy this book and experience it for yourself..100% guaranteed viewing pleasure.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was less than thrilled with this book.  The character development was weak.  The plot was not well thought out.  It was disappointing because I enjoyed her other books so much!
B0067LY4WG|4.0|Leonard Cohen probably surpasses Bob Dylan in his use of language and brilliant statement of affairs of the heart and of life. He is a genius in my opinion and I will always be thankful for having discovered him so long ago and keeping his work close. Such talent is rare and truely gifted from another source.<br />\\"The light came through the window, straight from the sun above, and so inside my little room, there plunged the rays of love.\\"
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Once in awhile someone makes a movie that works beautifully by using great dialogue, actors and a compelling story. This is one of those movies. Note to the action-oriented: nothing gets blown up in this film. No car crashes, no ghastly murder scenes, no CGI,  just a classic David Mamet film about interesting and believable characters, played by amazing actors. No 'good guys', no 'bad guys'; all of these characters are very human and very flawed--like most of us. I highly recommend this engaging film.
B00992CF6W|5.0|when is the next update for kindle fire i love it I love it I love it woooowhhooooooooooooo yeah who else likes it
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Loved Channing Tatums body in this movie but as for the subject line?  Mediocre.  It was slow except for the club scenes...wish it had focused more on the \\"behind the scenes\\" look at a male strip club and the characters.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Bob Dylan just never ceases to amaze. This album is all that can be expected. Perhaps dark, definately unique, and widely varried in subject matter it is truely enjoyable and took myself no getting used to it. I loved it the first time around.
1935597760|5.0|The Misremembered Man is an unusual book and by that, I mean unusually good.  Well written, likeable characters and a story worth reading.  Ms. McKenna managed to combine humor, despair and love in one neatly told tale.  I loved the beginning, the middle and especially the end.  Hoping for an encore performance.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book was one of the best books I've read in quite awhile! Can't wait to start the other ones!
B000007WNN|2.0|Well, as the title states, this was the beginning of the end of a once great band. The Cult put out a few amazing records (As Southern Death Cult, Death Cult, and Cult)  that epitomized gophic/punk-ish emo/indie from around 1980 on. But on this one finally did a 180 and changed direction. A change that some of us didn't like. Yet so many see this as some sort of landmark monumental release. Maybe for someone whose standards have been dumbed down and don't care about listening to punk any longer this might be great. That isn't me. They still have their share of goph/punk-ish ties to their past on this record in various forms but they still went down the tubes anyway you look at it.<br /><br />But anyone who truly loved what they did on compilation material from their early days as Southern Death Cult/Death Cult all the way through to Love would vomit in their mouth (as I did) after listening to this horrible sign of their catastrophic decline. This was the followup to Love...A new producer, a scrapping of old material and supposed to be their trek into more mature songwriting but something caused them to abandon who and what they once were.<br /><br />This album takes the poppiness leanings of their other records to such a (lack of) ambitious slant that it sounds like any other \\"alternative\\" dumbed down cock-rock pop band at the time played on the radio. They completely removed the punk elements and instead inserted in classic rock (which would become much more pronounced) and a toned down incarnation of what they had been doing just a few years before. Gone is the roughness, cheap production values, uniqueness, and devil may care attitude that made them the Cult. But it was all sadly replaced by a radio friendly, mainstream, glossy, overproduced, sellout piece of garbage caricature of what they used to be. As this record so aptly reminds us Ian,Billy, and the band ceased to have the fire and musical sensibilities they once had just a few years earlier on Love. And it would only get worse on every record after this until they closed up shop with each successive album selling less and less. By their last record, their transformation into Britney Spears pop territory had been complete. On here they were almost half way there.<br /><br />If you know music and the Cult like I do, buy all their records up to and including Love and erase everything else they did afterwards from your memories. I know I have ;)
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|it now will not start the game and I don't know if it is because of the new update or not. any fixes?
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am having fun playing this while my husband watches football. I just put on my headphones and off I go
B00742BVW8|4.0|One word : BEAUTIFUL..Wonderful theme music..Keeps you engrossed..A must-watch for people who love Chinese cinema..I would rate it alongside Fearless and Ip Man.. Awesome production value..
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If you like the fair/arcade game, then you will love Coin Dozer! Very addictive and fun game for the whole family.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was very disturbing but it was a great read. It wasn't your usual love story but yet I couldn't put it down. Loved it!!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. only negative is I wish there were clues. game is a lot of fun to play and get the family involved as well.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie was good but not great, Some of the acting was fair but, it has good special-effects, they definitely left It wide-open for a second movie!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very accurate device and battery charge time info. would recommend. on kindle fire 2nd gen it works like a charm
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Sad I missed it in the theater - but really adorable semi-dark movie - typical Wes Anderson.  Really compelling storyline and lovable characters.  Happily would watch again and again.  I should say it isn't as good at Royal Tenanbaums - but still pretty cute.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|I chose the five star rating mainly because I am a big fan of the Zac Brown Band which is to say great quality music.  They are a very talented and deeply moving musical group.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes country music but also to all those who enjoy well crafted music regardless of style.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Childish and stupid. I expected better. The characters were generic and the performances were lame. There were times when the movie had a chance to be funny, but the actors flubbed it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|A remarkable tale of desire and madness that will leave you changed and increasingly aware of house-bound psychological trauma. Makes us ponder what really does happen behind so many closed doors. Is your neighbor or a family member among the victims or perpetrators of closed door evil? Are there simplistic avenues of relief, or is this maddening realm of abuse as permanent as a slab of granite that lies empty and flat?<br /><br />Great characterizations and story line. Memorable in a haunting sort of way. To read this novel is almost as if you followed a dare. A peek inside grief and suppression.
B000OYC7A8|4.0|David Gilmour needs to get off his fat, lazy arse and make some new music!! Cmon Gilmour, you complacent, fat garlic eating bastard!! lol nah, Just Kidding! Love the version of Echoes on here with the late great Rick Wright and Dave's guitar sounds superb as always.
B0096HIEE2|1.0|The only thing good about this movie is Channing Tatum and Olivia Munn. The rest of the acting was pathetic. If you want to call it acting when all you do is walk around with your mouth hanging open and talking like a retard then Matthew McConaughey should get an award. He was awful. The dancing was pitiful. Terrible moive dont waste your money. Channing does have a beautiful butt!
B005HSL626|4.0|you don't think... which I like sometimes. adds aren't bad. it is addicting and fun! I don't see why people would rate this only 1 star.
B000IZ1HP4|5.0|One of the Best westerns of all time. Reccomend to anyone who like good acting, cinematography, and storyline. This is a must for anyone collecting amercian westerns.
B0000026NC|4.0|Love the track selection here versus Pulse (but don't get me wrong. i dug Pulse too). Love that they included live version of some of the key tracks from Momentary Lapse Of Reason, the Roger Water-less studio record they were touring for @ da time. Favorites are: Learning To Fly, Dogs Of War, On The Turning Away, One Of These Days, Run Like Hell, and one of my favorites on there Comfortably Numb (is that Rick Wright signing Roger's part?).
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Not bad, but I wouldn't read it again.  I read the book b/c the movie was coming out.  However, I was slightly disappointed.  It was very predictable and had some monotonous sections.  That said, it was an easy read, I was done in a day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was fantastic! Cannot wait to read the other two!! Simply perfect! Loved it to the last page and on!
B008YJFDQK|4.0|AN AMAZING ARTIST XX XXX XXXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XX XXX XXX XX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXXXX XX X
B005PTQPU0|4.0|I consider myself well versed in alternative Pop music, yet i've somehow managed to neglect an artist who's reputation is gargantuan in this area (shame on me!). Kate bush is obviously who I'm referring to and the conventional entry point most of the uninitiated are recommended to take when diving into her considerable ouevre would be \\"Hounds Of Love\\". Me being the bohemian that I am ;) decided to go for her most recent effort \\"50 Words For Snow\\" first. Although her 1985 record is said to be a genre defining masterpiece and her unquestionable magnum opus, I'd be blown away if it's considerably better than her latest offering as this album is devastatingly brilliant. Each song here subtely envelopes your soul and sets your heart ablaze, whether it's the mixture of glacial piano chords and fantastical story telling in opener \\"Snowflake\\" or the jazz inspired epic balladry of the similarly dreamlike \\"Misty\\". They all leave such a strong impression on you once you've experienced them, I'm not a religous man but after listening to kate's tenth studio album, I felt blessed by some divine spirit.<br /><br />The childlike themes present here in these seven songs have irked some old time fans, who feel she's finally disappeared into a sea of pretension. Tracks like the aforementioned \\"Snowflake\\" where the narrative is centred around her search for the abominable Snowmen or the title track where Kate and Steve Gadd effectively list 50 words for snow are ostensibly quite easy to mock. Yet the darkly evocative mood that's created on these lengthy pieces, with the ambient instrumentation and sensual vocal exhchanges (the former featuring the angelic voice of Mrs Bush's 13 year old son) is utterly palpable. These songs are lyrically moving too With tender and thought provoking metaphorical lines like \\"His crooked mouth is full of dead leaves, crushed and stolen grasses from slumbering lawn\\" and \\"Lying in my tent, I can hear your cry echoing round the mountainside/ You sound lonely.\\" This poetry and the understated blissfullness of the melodies on 50 words for snow, could have only come from a musician who's passion and artisitc maturity are in perfect alignment. I feel like a fool for neglecting to check out this uniquely talented individual for so long, If all of Kate Bush's work is as stunning as this, consider me the newest memeber of her colossal fanclub.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love the look, love the action ... love being able to pick the winning hand deal, when you lost, and need confidence again
B008B11R2A|5.0|our first record was scratched.  we had an easy,quick return and we love this record! xx is the best. thanks for making this whole process easy.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I've read this book twice and seen the American-made movie of this book.  Of course, reading this book compels one to read the whole trilogy.  After finishing the trilogy, I can't believe that Larsson died and can't write any more of these tremendously enjoyable books.  I expect that I will read this book again in the future.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|Let's face facts here. We came to see hot men strip. I also came for the great dance skills of Channing Tatum. The story was bland and there was not enough dancing. And when there was dancing, we didn't get the full song / routine. I was hoping the DVD release would have the ability to just watch ALL of the dance routines in their entirety--those shown in the film and those edited out. Apparently not. That MIGHT have made it worth the purchase of this film. Having said that... I will not be purchasing this flick.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler was a part of the Nazi party who had his own business. He wanted his business to generate more revenue and felt his connections to Nazi Germany would allow him to get more money by convincing Jewish people to invest in his company. Schindler was very excited about the many possibilities the war would help him become rich during all the changes economically. He realized that he wasn't capable of keeping his financial books and managing a company of a large magnitude, therefore he hired a Jewish man named Stern, to help him in those areas. He was adamant about getting into the exchange of goods because money was worthless in the ghetto at this point in the war. His plans would make him rich beyond desire. Stern understood that in time hiring Jewish people to work in the factory would help ensure them from being killed or sent off to concentration camps. Schindler doesn't know that Stern has used this factory as a safe haven to protect his people. Later he doesn't realize what is going on after Stern bring a man to him that wanted to thank him for helping save his life. Schindler's breaking point was when a little girl came to beg her parents to be employed at this factory, he pays off Geoth to allow him to build his own sub camp for Jews to live.

As readers, we need to demand better writing and better stories. There was very little redeeming in the story or characters. It's fifty shades of gray for sure. Sorry. I will not be looking to read more from this author.

0307730697|5.0|This is no story.  This is real life of a man who survived against tremendous odds. His descent into drug abuse and convictions as a felon should have made it impossible to fulfill his dream to become a Navy Seal.  The love of his family for him made them able to bring the charges that led to his imprisonment -- the toughest kind of love in action.  His willingness to enter a year-long Teen Challenge program as a \\"get out of jail free card\\" was an important step in moving him from nominal Christianity to growth into the real thing.  It has to be a miracle that he was accepted in a program to become a Seal.<br /><br />Then continuing to overcome all kinds of adversities (his favorite drug kept \\"calling his name\\" even after becoming a Seal; training accidents that eventually led to the loss of an eye; a variety of injuries)he still grew into not only a model Seal and also a model Christian whose example continues, even after his death on a mission in Afghanistan, to be example to his fellow Seals, and to readers who will get to know him through this book.

0307960471|5.0|There was a time when Jo Nesbo was called \\"the next Stieg Larsson\\". Not any more. The Norwegian crime writer has sold over 14 million books worldwide as well as having been translated into 40 languages.  Since I began reading Nesbo last year, I've found that his publisher has been playing fast and loose with publishing dates. In Nesbo's novels featuring the detective Harry Hole (I'll discuss the name in a minute), there are 9. But his publisher will publish a new Harry Hole novel in the UK and US before publishing an old one. It makes it very hard to try and keep up with where Harry was the last time you saw him. Now let's deal with the name, Harry Hole. Now there are some people in the US who would put this bull's eye of a name on their kid. I had to find out if this was the name used on the Norwegian language novels. I wrote a review on Amazon UK and asked if someone would respond to my question, \\"Is his name really Harry Hole or is it Lars something?\\" I got an answer from a UK reader who led me to the BBC Worldwide Book Club which had an interview with Nesbo. He was asked to pronounce Harry Hole in Norwegian. Here it is as best as I can decipher in phonetics: Hurree Who-la. With that bit of information out of the way, let's get on with Jo Nesbo and his writing. He's complex and ambitious. You need to be alert and wide awake because he likes to drop vague clues along the way. It doesn't help that the place names and characters' names are Norwegian. I sometimes give them nicknames so I can read right over the name. And then he mixes in some Russians, Swedes and you've got a true smorgasbord.<br /><br /> Harry has got to be the most damaged protagonist in crime history. The scenes describing Harry's bouts with alcoholism are heartbreaking. As one reviewer describes Harry: \\"Harry is fascinated by evil...he's a loner, with a hard boiled sensitivity and an intuition that borders on the super-natural...he is a genuine anti-hero; an impossible character yet impossible not to like.\\" He has a scar that runs from his mouth to his ear and a titanium middle finger. He has a real love in his life, Rakel, but every time he gets close, something always bad happens. Rakel has a son named Oleg, who thinks of Harry as his father. So, after The Snowman, Harry was fired from his police job, and then he moved to Thailand. Rakel will have nothing to do with him. But now she needs him and, therefore, begins Phantom. Oleg is now 17 and has gotten himself into big trouble, not only with the law but with drugs. He is accused of killing his friend, Gusto, who is a drug dealer and thief. Harry returns to Norway to find out if he can clear Oleg and keep him out of trouble. With Harry there is always trouble. This time with a new drug, \\"violin\\", being sold on the streets by a Russian gangster that no one ever sees, therefore, he is called the Phantom. He has a mob of kids selling the drugs, three of which are Oleg, Gusto and Gusto's sister, Irene. \\"Violin\\" is synthetic heroin. The story is told in the present and then with flashbacks provided by Gusto. The story begins with Gusto lying on the floor of his drug pad after having been shot. One chapter is Gusto explaining the truth and the next is Harry trying to figure out the truth. There are a couple of side stories with corrupt politicians and airline pilot smuggling schemes which do add some details about the Phantom.<br /><br />Nesbo's books are full of violence. In this one there a brick studded with nails. It is placed strategically on a rope which faces the entrance. When the person enters, SMACK! A face punctured by nails. There is also a special type of water boarding that is used that in comparison to what we consider water boarding, ours is a walk in the park. And there is always a way in which Harry somehow gets his body damaged. This time he sews up his cut throat with a needle and black thread. And being as claustrophobic as I am, I was squirming as Harry got himself into quite a \\"close\\" situation.<br /><br />I thought I knew who killed Gusto and I thought I knew the answers to the questions. Nope. Just as you think the story is wrapped up, here comes another set of circumstances to again drive you crazy. I was yelling, no! no! no! it can't be!<br /><br />Bottom line: If you like really complex crime novels that have relentless momentum, then read Phantom.uation.<br /><br />I thought I knew who killed Gusto and I thought I knew the answers to the questions.

0525958002|5.0|Being a Duranie since 1982, this book answered some questions I have always had. I think John had to walk a fine line of what he could and could not say and he was extremely classy about the whole thing. He told more on himself (and so it should be) than anyone else. Would I have like to have gotten more juicy details, yes but I feel have gave a better picture of the Duran split in the 80s than Andy did in his book. There are many beautiful, heartwarming stories about Tony Thompson, Robert Palmer, Nile Rodgers, Bernard Edwards, Nick Rhodes, Simon Le Bon, etc.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|My daughter,15, and I watched this together and I really did like the music. The only problem was that it could have included a bit more of the 80's music. But still in all it was cute and we sang through the story along with the actors, so it was worth the watch.

B007FLHW3K|5.0|I was skeptical before getting the Monkeylectric lights. I mean the Internet is full of products that overpromise and underdeliver. Not this one.<br /><br />Installation took around 20 minutes, and then I was off for a test ride. These babies shine! Even on the lower brightness setting they have incredible visibility. I actually only use the higher brightness  when I use them during the daytime. Choosing the patterns and colors is super easy and riding around town with your Monkeylectric lights is guaranteed to turn heads; exactly what you need when you're on a bike -- visibility.<br /><br />I was really impressed by the battery life. I use [[ASIN:B004UG41XW Sanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]] and they last for over 20 hours of use consistently. Battery low indicator is also helpful and starts to briefly show up with over an hour of juice left.<br /><br />This is easily the best accessory you can get for your bike. Highly recommended.

B000B5XOXY|4.0|Batman Forever is a good movie that gets a bad rap. As far as Batman films go, it isn't as amazing as the first Tim Burton film. It isn't as brilliant as Batman Returns, but it does have charm. Viewers and fans alike incorrectly and unfairly lump this movie in with the ill-fated Batman and Robin, one of the worst major Hollywood movies ever made. They do so because it features many of the same cast members, the same director and a slight continuity with its successor.<br /><br />The differences between the two are many...  First is the fact that this film is much more comic book inspired than really any Batman films other than the first Batman or the Nolan films. It features an accurate depiction of the origin of Robin, something up until this film was made, many comic fans were hoping for. The next is that this film has a built in psychological underpinning (the last film has none and is paper-thin). This psychology comes in the form of a red book, Bruce Wayne's father's diary. We get to see how Bruce found it upon his parent's death and how it shaped him. Because of this, the film develops more of who Bruce is and why he became Batman.<br /><br />The villains are Two-Face and Riddler this time out. Two-Face's origin is also directly from the comics, but is only briefly touched upon. Two-Face is played very straight, but in a hammy sort of way by Tommy Lee Jones. His Two-Face is somehow both threatening and silly at the same time. It's a neat way to explore the dichotomy of Two-Face, a serious, disturbed villain contrasted with an obnoxious and bombastic side. The Riddler is even more of a clownish, over-the-top villain as played by Jim Carrey. Carrey clearly channels Frank Gorshin, the Riddler of the 60's TV show. Since the Riddler had no set origin, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, gave him an inspired one: a Wayne-Tech employee who is manic and obsessed with Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />The love interest in this film is portrayed by Nichole Kidman who is a psychologist (to go with the psychology subplot of Bruce Wayne's past). Unfortunately, she serves as little more than eye candy and a temptress for Batman.<br /><br />The action is over-the-top and it feels like an overblown summer blockbuster. The set designs are similar to the Fascistic Gotham City that was featured in Batman Returns but feature many more colors, complete with falic symbols and neon lights. The batsuit and Robin suit look much closer to the original designs in the first Batman film. The vehicles are very eyepopping and fascistic as well.<br /><br />All in all, this film, while not as good as the first, is a fun ride and DOES NOT deserve all the bad press.<br /><br />Elliot Goldenthal is in charge of score for this film and delivers much less operatic, but more heroic and upbeat music than Danny Elfman did during his time as composer.to go with the psychology subplot of Bruce Wayne's past).

B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham has such a engaging and upbeat writing style that I always feel good after reading one of his books. Characters in The Litigators are flawed but ultimately likeable.  The plot is riveting without resorting to torturing women or menacing children or any of the other cruelty common in suspense novels. While I'm not generally squeamish about that sort of thing, it's still nice to find a really good read without it. This is a highly enjoyable book that I recommend without reservation.
B009JNXK88|1.0|Some good ideas here but my god it gets old extremely fast. I actually only made it to the 4th mission when I gave up on it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I rarely write reviews, but I have to write one for this game.  I play a lot of different games and every once in a while a free game comes through that is amazing.  The graphics in this game are really nice and the game play is very simple with just a swipe of the finger on how you want the character to move.  There are some ads, but they there are only once you launch the app, and of course they have some in app purchases available, but you don't have to buy them.  This game becomes very challenging and addictive the more you play and progess in the game.  I would give this a 5 star rating if it availabe to all Android devices and not limited to the Kindle Tablet?  Not sure why some apps are only Kindle tablet specified when they work just as well on any phone or other tablet.  Suffice to say I don't have a Kindle tablet, but do have a lot of Android devices and got this game to the Goog Play Store.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|Even darker and more stylized than its predecessor, Batman Returns is first and foremost a visual marvel. I personally was only 6 years old when Batman Returns was released and back then I took the film at face value: style, great action and cool villains. Later and more recent viewings have made me see the film for what it really is: a visually stunning and dark parody of the first film.<br /><br />While it is a sequel to one of the greatest films in the annals of cinema, it plays out much like the same film with new characters and new situations. I do consider this to be a very solid movie, and one of the best Batman outings to date, but no new ground was broken and it lacks something that the first film had.<br /><br />This film seemed less influenced by the darker comic books of the late 1980's and more from the eccentric mind of the film's director, Tim Burton. The only real connection it has to the first is through minor character development for Bruce Wayne and the fact that it builds on that film's continuity. We have the interesting, quasi-political script of Daniel Waters to thank for bringing a hesitant Burton back into the director's chair. Burton reprises his trademark gothic style, and delivers with force a new, more Burtonized world.<br /><br />Casting was very obvious. Michael Keaton was recast as Batman and obviously new villains had to be introduced. The Penguin and Catwoman were decided on as they were the most recognizable villains, next to the Joker, and would provide an interesting relation to Batman in that they were \\"animal people\\" as Tim Burton put it. The role of the Penguin was scripted for Danny DeVito; the character was quite literally made for him, and Annette Bening won the role of Catwoman, but was swiftly replaced by Michelle Pfeiffer upon learning she was pregnant. Of course, there was also the small matter of casting the villainous supporting character; Maximillion Shreck. Clearly, Christopher Walken's demeanor was made for a character like Shreck.<br /><br />Like with Jack Nicholson as the Joker previously, Danny DeVito steals the show depicting Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot. The deliveries in all his lines are perfectly sinister/comedic when appropriate. He is essentially Batman's true foe in the film. The most obvious thing to note is Burton's complete reinvention of the Penguin's character. To coincide with his typically dark theme; the original penguin simply could not fit the script: tearing away the dignified, cigarette smoking aristocrat to be replaced with a physically deformed, sadistic, sewer living monster. His short-lived return to society and humiliation emphasizes his homicidal nature when he decides the whole of Gotham City must pay for his parents abandoning him as a baby. Personally, I think he's a fantastic villain, with an excellent background.<br /><br />Of more interest, is Catwoman coming into being. Pfeiffer plays Selena Kyle; the down-trodden, lowly secretary with fantastic solicitude; it's also interesting to note that in her initial scenes with Max Shreck, she plays a background figure of absolute no importance. How fitting that when she creates her alter-ego as Catwoman, she not only dominates the screen, but completely blows her original character out of the water. This Catwoman is one of the strongest secondary villains in any Batman movie partly due to the fact that she functions as a love interest to the hero.<br /><br />Christopher Walken as Max Shreck (named after the German actor who played the original Nosferatu) is a confusing and curious character. He was created for the movie and serves primarily as a connection to Selina Kyle and as a segue into the Penguin For Mayor plot. In all my years as a fan of this film, I've always thought of Shreck as nothing more than a plot device to tie certain elements of the story together.<br /><br />Despite the amount of characters to contend with, the film isn't busy. It's paced well, in fact. I don't think this particularlycompromises the storyline as multiple villains in later comic book movies have. Each villain is well fleshed out in terms of background. I would have liked to see Keaton speak more in this (apparently, he sat down with the writer and crossed out many of the lines that were given him to fit the silent, dark, brooding stereotype).<br /><br />Danny Elfman's famous score is built upon masterfully in this film. Most scenes are often either accompanied by his signature haunting and dramatic scores. The Batman theme seems to inspire an air of energy by itself.<br /><br />As far as set design, as I mentioned before, things are more Burtonized. It's as if the concept for production designs in this film were to marry the abstract and gothic designs of the first Batman film with the weird and bizarre styling of Bettlejuice. Burton and Bo Welch (production) decidedly they wanted a decidedly fascist style to the city landscape. The architecture of the city almost seems completely different than that of the first film. The Batcave seems to have added another wing and the batsuit has become more aerodynamic. Beyond this, the stylistic elements from the first film have changed very little.<br /><br />While not as memorable as the first film, this film is quite fun and adds new elements to the Burton-Batman universe that had not been previously explored.compromises the storyline as multiple villains in later comic book movies have.

B005G02RIC|5.0|Ruggero Raimondi in this bluray is the best Scarpia I have ever heard. Even Gobbi in the mythical Callas/De Sabata recording can not match Raimondi perfidy: he is scary, smart, lecherous, and in remarkable vocal form. When he is on scene he completely steals the show. And what a show! The production of this Tosca is a great combination of tradition and innovation, big and bold. The Te Deum scene is breathtaking, and both singers and orchestra seem to be as emotionally taken by it as I was.<br /><br />What about Tosca? Fiorenza Cedolins looks stunning, she is passionate in her acting. She is no Callas though, her voice feels closed up top and lacks agility. At the end of Vissi d'arte (her big aria) she sounded strained but also fearless and generous. Similar remarks could be made about Marcelo Alvarez as Cavaradossi. At times is he is really good (O dolci baci) and at times he sounds like he is singing Trovatore rather than Puccini (the opening aria, Recondita Armonia was particularly bad).<br /><br />Finally good grades for the band and Oren, very Puccinian, the technical quality of the bluray and the surprisingly good sound
B004GYY714|5.0|I have really enjoyed using Tunein Radio.  I get perfect reception and get to carry my Kindle Fire around the house with me, not missing a single second.
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|While it is a challenge to disengage my nostalgic affection for this film from the critical process and take a critical, objective look at this film, I really must start this review by saying that Tim Burton's 1989 celluloid revitalization of the Batman character is the greatest Batman film of all time. It holds up very well. That's not to say that the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy is not a masterpiece as a whole, it really is, but, due to its mandated \\"realistic\\" concepts, the Nolan trilogy is much less a series of comic book films and much more in the genre of crime drama or crime fiction.<br /><br />Tim Burton's gothic take on the character was a very stylized vision, which is what a comic book film like this needs. The plot really comes off as a fun, dark action caper just like you would read in an issue of Batman or Detective Comics (not surprising as the film was written by comic book scribe/fan Sam Hamm). Tonally it is most inspired by Frank Miller's wonderful story, The Dark Knight Returns. Aesthetically, it is inspired by a great Joker story by Alan Moore called The Killing Joke. Story-wise it takes its cues from The Killing Joke as well as the popular 70's run on Detective Comics by Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers. But while Tim Burton would take elements from all of these notable stories, his main source of inspiration would seem to be the Bob Kane's original Batman run from the early 1940's. These comics presented the original character, a Batman who was hidden in the shadows, prepared to kill and teetering on the edge of sanity.<br /><br />As faithful as this movie was to the source material, the casting was also inspired. While a square-jawed, action orientated actor would have been more of an obvious choice Tim Burton's casting of Michael Keaton as Batman would become of the movie's greatest strengths. Keaton, who at the time was better known for more comedic roles, was able to deliver a performance that was nuanced, subtle and iconic. Jack Nicholson would be the one to secure the role of The Joker. He crafted a performance that took elements of the Joker from every incarnation of the character and melded them into something very memorable. He really portrayed the Joker of the 70's and 80's comics, using gags like electric buzzers and trick guns. While not as psychotic or menacing as Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight, Nicholson's interpretation is still scary. However, like Cesar Romero before him, he was perhaps a little too fun and overly charming. He's also the most entertaining thing in the film. There really is nothing to match the Joker's sheer presence and sense of fun in this movie and as a result, Keaton's Batman is a perfect contrast as the dark and brooding hero. Of course with Nicholson and Keaton giving their all in the star spots you'd expect the supporting cast to be somewhat overshadowed. But Tim Burton's quirky style actually manages to make surprisingly thin character at least a little interesting. Kim Basinger actually makes the role of Vicky Vale fun while minor roles like the reporter, Alexander Knox, and the Joker's right hand man, Bob the goon, are given subtle but interesting life. Even Alfred Pennyworth is charming.<br /><br />Lastly, the production design is also one of the film's strengths. The set really forces this film to feel timeless. Gotham City is certainly memorable. With its art-deco stylings and gothic spires Tim Burton's Gotham looks like a city that erupted from a pulp-inspired hell. Elements of this dark city suggest abstract American design while other facets are obviously European and Germanic. It really is a melting pot of ideas and yet somehow the film manages to shoulder the majority of its excesses. The batmobile, batsuit, batplane, props and batcave all compliment the rest of the sets. The batmobile is my favorite of any ever used in films, comics or otherwise. Danny Elfman's evocative score also has to be one of the greatest and most memorable film scores ever put to celluloid, next to the likes of music for Star Wars, Superman: The Movie, Jaws and John Carpenter's Halloween. The Prince songs in the film serve as the Joker's own personal soundtrack.<br /><br />All in all, Batman has a charm that I've never been able to put my finger on. It's got an electric cast, a great soundtrack and a director with a unique vision. For me it is a film I enjoy for its stylish imagination, its fantastic production design and the fact that it turned me into a lifelong comics fan and a nearly obsessed Batman fan.res ever put to celluloid, next to the likes of music for Star Wars, Superman: The Movie, Jaws and John Carpenter's Halloween.

B009GEDP26|5.0|The comedy/drama stories are unfailingly good and engaging without being either as horrifying or unnecessarily, nauseatingly gory as some are (Bones, for example) and the love chemistry between Rick Castle (Nathan Fillion) and Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) - a tantalizingly long time emerging - is spellbinding. They are both wonderful performers and Stana Katic, in addition to being an excellent actor, is easily one of the most stunningly beautiful women alive - no minor compliment in what is in fact a universe of beautiful Hollywood glamor \\"babes\\". She is so far beyond \\"eye candy\\" as to make that descriptive term meaningless. Fillion - as he proved in the all-too short-lived \\"Firefly\\" series - is extraordinary and unique as a comic/action/love interest player. Together, they draw you inexorably, almost nail-bitingly into their developing personal drama. All the supporting players, from Lanie the ME to Rick's daughter and mother, and the two other team detectives, Esposito and Ryan, are likewise wonderful and add the perfect extra dimension to this five-star show.<br /><br />DRBridge

But it doesn't, it just tells me cute kitty jokes, and awesomely over-stated observations. I love the new comics in this book, and even the old favourites such as 'The Bobcats' are a delight on the page.  I must say, I thought I'd find the old stuff boring, but you really can't beat owning a comic on actual paper. It's nice to be able to flick through randomly and laugh my ass off at something horrifying and cute that a kitty is getting up to. I would have given 5 stars, but my kitty died in between the time I ordered the book, and when it arrived...so some of it was sad.
B007TK77QE|1.0|I was bitterly disappointed in this book.  I admit i probably was expecting far too much. A rarity for me, but, I did not even finish reading. The story line took far too long to get anywhere.
B008133DO8|5.0|One of the more entertaining views of Sherlock Holmes and Watson.  It's a shame that after only two seasons it's not viewable any longer.  Sherlock Holmes although a pain in the butt was really interesting to watch and Dr. Watson is a gem as he deals with life with Holmes and attempts to socialize.  This series showed that Holmes was actually a human rather then a computer in human form.  I am sorry to see it unavailable.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|Hello Kitty Cafe is just like the other Cafe games except for it is Hello Kitty characters rather than (insert any other Cafe game). Game itself is not bad, just not anything new or creative.
B004YKSXYW|3.0|A very good book for simple understanding. However, the language used is culturally european, not sure at what age one can read it, as universal systems in formal education not longer exists. Each country has it´s own parameters, mostly very low. With acces for Internet, the book has limitations as concentration in reading diminishes. Maybe good for the young, but better for adults!<br />Ina Ouang
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I purchased this book to satisfy a bottomless hunger to know what happens when we die. Since the death of my 27 year old daughter I have been on a insatiable quest to find out anything that might bring me comfort to know her young life wasn't just ended. I, like Dr Alexander, had the faith and religion pretty much drummed out of me when I became a nursing student, and this has continued over the years. When you are trained to value the physical status over spiritual existence, it is very hard to continue to swallow the religious indoctrination we received as children.  Still don't know if I give much credence to the \\"bible\\" but I do believe a part of us does go on after our bodily death.  Not sure if it is wishful thinking on my part or my yearning to accept the most horrific blow life can bestow, the loss of a child. I did find some answers which were lacking in other NDE books that I have read, with one exception, a book I had read by Dr Melvin Morse. I have tried just about everything available to relieve my pain, psychics, reading books about NDEs, and religion. None helped,and some were quite financially draining (psychics). I do feel this book has helped me reach a better understanding and acceptance for a situation far beyond my control. It has helped with some of those haunting questions that keep me up nights and cloud my days.  I will recommend this book in my next Compassionate Friends meeting, and I recommend to all here searching for some answers to what we will all face in time.
030758836X|5.0|I read this book in one sitting (staying up until 3 a.m.), which doesn't happen to me often. As someone who came of age in the 1980s, I could relate to the cultural references, professional frustrations and personal discovery/exploration. The ending works for me, too.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|The product is fun to play. Not very challenging at first but grows on you as you move to the different levels. I would definately recomend this product.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book!! I like it as much as the first Bared to You. Very much looking forward for the third!!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Not sure why this was written.  I've enjoyed the series but this had no point.  I'll have to think hard before I pick up another of this authors books.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|One of the worst movies I've had the misforune to watch! I don't know why I watched it to the end. Maybe I was hoping for something interresting to happen.
B0079J28NC|5.0|This story is so cute and full of colorful fun experiences along the way, riding in a Yellow Submarine. The details of the cartoon is so incrediable, most amazing cartoon I have ever seen. The documentary that was done by the producer is such a great piece of history of cartoon making and the Beatles. It is a must for any Beatle Fan. Love It.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|First off, I went into Prometheus not entirely sure if I was indeed watching an Alien prequel or not. (according to the studio) First it was, then it wasn't, then it kinda was but they weren't calling it one, etc. Let me say that Prometheus most definitely is part of the Alien story. It just goes in an uncommon direction. The deciding factor in whether you're going to like this film or not, is what you hope to get out of an Alien prequel. If you're looking for a space horror like the original, this is not so much that. If you want an other-worldly guns-a-blazing action flick like Aliens, this is not really that either. What this is, is somewhere between those films, with a much bigger emphesis on story. As a movie-buff and one of those 70-80's kids who grew up on films like Alien and Star Wars, I constantly wanted to know what was behind everything. Where did these aliens come from? Who/what was that fossilized (appearing) creature sitting behind the big gun when the Nostromo crew entered the ship on LV-426? Who's ship is this & why was it there? Questions such as these are finally answered with Prometheus, along with one giant revelation to an unposed question. One that is much larger and far deeper than anything else contemplated within this series. One that could be potentially very disturbing to some. I will go no further into that aspect, so as not to spoil anything. Of course this film has guns-a-blazing action and the spooky atmosphere of the first two films... Just not to the degree of either one. This is a well balanced Sci-Fi film, with some truly spectacular visuals & effects that most importantly, do not overtake the story. If you're one of the few who has never seen the original Alien films, doing so is not really required (though highly suggested). The way in which these old questions are answered is not done in such a way that you ever had to have asked them in the first place. There is no big fanfare or fancy reveal, as to say HERE IT IS!. The film is thankfully not ruined in that way. But for those who have seen the first four films and have questions, the moments where everything just comes together are found in Prometheus. While this film could stand on it's own, it is left begging for a sequel, as all ends are not tied up and new questions are definitely asked.<br /><br />As far as the picture & sound quality of this (Blu-ray) disc are concerned, both are absolutely stunning. Prometheus is quite probably the best looking & sounding live action BD I have ever viewed. To put simply, the picture is breathtakingly flawless. I could detect no artifacts, banding or any other negative aspect, even in dark & high contrast scenes. Color is vibrant yet realistic and blacks are decidedly black. Sound is dynamic with great bass and effects are precisely placed. Most importantly (and sadly uncommon) is the fact that dialog is consistantly clear and audible without having to adjust the volume between voice & effects. When it comes to picture & sound, Prometheus is of reference quality and sets a new standard.
B00846REIS|5.0|The story is a character study of two wounded,broken people who come together out of physical chemistry, but begin to open their wounded selves as love develops. I enjoyed getting  glimpses into who they both truly are. The author did a good job of slowly developing her characters and the plot. I hadn't intended on buying the second volume, but I did because I became attached to the characters. Gideon is a gentle soul even though he comes of as a strong powerful no nonsence businessman. Loved him. Eva is insecure, yet so capable of fighting for and caring for those she loves, even when she hasn't learned to love herself the same way. Love her. Really love the two of them together. I wish volume 3 would come out before May!!!!! Great book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun to play! I am almost level 61. It works great on my Samsung 4G. I recommend it for all ages.
3836527286|5.0|This is the most BEAUTIFUL book I have ever seen. It is huge and full of life like color, it was much bigger than I anticpated. I have about 40 Beatle related Very nice books, This one is rated #1, a must for any McCartney fan as well fan of REAL rock and roll. Thanks so Much to the publishers ,Linda McCartney and Paul for being so cute!!!
B0084I9QFU|5.0|This DVD of Michael's London Wembley concert is excellent...in every way.  The concert camera footage was done very well..and one could see much more of Michael on stage...(and fewer shots of the audience, which are, in my opinion, not so interesting.  One shot of girls being carried out on stretchers is quite enough)  I really enjoyed the concert...Michael exceeded even himself...perhaps because of the presence of Charles and Diana.  And in the middle of the concert, the musicians (2 keyboardists, 3 guitarists, and the drummer) played by themselves--variations on the THRILLER Theme.  This was, to my mind, an excellent choice...then Michael came roaring on in white...in 'Working Day and Night.'  Altogether an excellent DVD ...and one which people (especially MJ fans) will love.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|loved the game lots of fun. I liked the different levels and different ways to play the game. very addicting.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|My three stars may not be a fair assessment. It's a good browser but I was looking for an android browser that was speedier than the one that came with my tablet. No such luck.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Great read--hard to put down.  Best book in the series, with a totally unexpected ending.  I'm looking forward to more books from this author.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a great continuation of the characters in book one.  I love the history, and the interwoven lives of people in that time frame.  I hated world history in high school, but now reading these books by Ken Follett, I am inspired to absorb more of what I neglected to learn years ago.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|Every song on this album is unique and has it's own qualities.  I enjoy this album over and over.  Great!
B008IZ6GNE|5.0|What a great concept! Puts a new spin on the concept of good and evil. Can a person commit horrible acts in the name of good? Ah...yeah! Its called human nature. Dexter is in all of us, just join the armed forces to find him!
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Funny and outstanding and is a great but short read. I reccomend this book to any obssessing cat people. Read it
B003TSEEDY|4.0|A very well written book, and a great insight into the mind of a teenager. I would highly recommend this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you read Bared To You then this book is definitely MUST read. I can't wait for the third book to come out!
030758836X|2.0|I decided to read this book due to its high ratings in the reviews and boy was I disappointed.  I wish I could rave about this book, about the storyline and all that goes with the satisfaction of finsihing a great book; but I can't.  I didn't care for the ending and felt let down.  The author takes you through this roller coaster of a story to end it the way she did just really irked me.  When I finished the last page I just couldn't help but feel so let down.  The ending was a huge let down.  I could write more but about all that is left to say is read the other low rating reviews before you spend the money on this book.  I should have read them and I will for future books I decide to read.  I can see the appeal to this story because I was sucked in to the great reviews but sad to say, I felt ripped off.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Well, what can one say about Lee Child's writing style.  I would say consistent.  Consistently good.  Consistently exciting and MOST of all, entertaining.  This book is a very good read, if what you want is entertainment and something that does a bit more than just pass the time.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I am a huge fan of Modern Family and season 3 does not disappoint. It's one of those shows that I can watch an episode over and over again because it's so funny.
B0045INTVA|1.0|Not a movie for a thinking person... a movie for people easily impressed by shadows and lies. I'm starting to think Martin Sheen ruins every movie he's ever been in. The whole movie makes you wait for some huge revelation. In the end there is none, just an empty pathetic husk of truth.
0345529057|5.0|The books came on time, and in great condition. Absolutely no complaints to be had.<br /><br />And if you're looking for a review of the books themselves; They're worth every penny and second you spend on them.
1932100660|5.0|Reading The China study, by Dr.s T. Colin Campbell and Thomas M. Campbell, has really opened  my eyes to the importance of eating a 10% animal protein or LESS diet, focusing on a plant based diet for good nutrition.  I am so impressed by the clarity and transparency of their work, and how important it is to pay attention to what we eat in this world so full of contaminants and carcinogens.  I love cheese but it does not love me.  And I am disappointed to see how much money controls what we hear from the FDA about good nutrition.  I have had medical doctors recommend a plant based diet to me recently, but as for details, like how much fish or chicken is healthy to eat (very little, 10% or less of daily calories) I get no direct instruction.  I appreciate Dr.s Campbell sharing their experiments as well as the information from the China Study about why the natural foods we have enjoyed as a species for hundreds of thousands of years are not to blame directly, but its the poisons in the environment that interact with protein metabolism that are triggering cancer, inflammation and diabetes.  We can no longer live in a chemically pristine world but we can choose what we eat.  Most people know that over processed, prepared foods are not good for you, but just how the mechanism seems to come together with toxins in the environment is amazing to read about.  Dr.s Campbell: Thank you for risking your professional reputations to bring the truth to the general public.  I am sure much of this information is well known to the medical policy makers and they are pressured to keep quiet to support the cattle and milk industry that is polluting both the earth and our bodies, and by the special interest groups that support contaminated food sources like Monsanto.  At least now people have some information about how to take care of themselves if they choose to do so.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Fun Read! So far all of Rick Riordan's books are greatly entertaining with twists on ancient myths. Try them all!
B002LII6KA|5.0|The DVD collection provides an awesome backstory to how the movies were developed and filmed.  The martial arts training background was absolutely fascinating.  The commentary track with Dr. Cornel West and Ken Wilber was just phenomenal and vastly informative.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I am a fan of all Jack Reacher novels and this was no exception.  I could not put it down.  There is always lots of twists and turns.  I give this one 5 stars.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Bought for my grandson but it didn't really keep his intersest. He loves Cars and Madagascar but he may just be to young for this movie.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie is very well made. Great script and even if you have not seen some of the other movies each charecter is so well defined it is easy to follow. Yet it does not take you so far into the characters ss to become boring. Enjoyed every minute of this movie. Watched several times. It was that good. Husband enjoyed and actually watched the whole movie.  My seventeen year old grandson had recommended the movie to us. Seems to be a good movie to watch with older children.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed the first book so much that I pre-ordered \\"Winter of the World\\", and I was not disappointed. This books picks up the pace right were the first left off and before the reader knows what him her/him, you are submerged in this great story all over again.  Ken Follett is a gifted author with a talent for great character dimension and development.  There are some triumphs in this book involving less savory characters, and sadness for some that were loved from the first book.  The story evolves through the war and the hardships faced and endured.  The only bad thing about this Trilogy is waiting for the next book.  Five stars again!
B0031R5K68|5.0|Great read couldn't put it down,Dan brown has done it again!can wait for the film,I'd give it 5 out of 5!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is a Christmas classic. For me it ranks up there with The Christmas Story and classic cartoon movie The Grinch who Stole Christmas. What separates this title from the later is it is way more funnier.  You can't go wrong with this movie.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|If AMERICAN HORROR STORY doesn't give you nightmares, nothing will. There is nothing like this show on TV and it is beyond creey and scary. It is am homage to every horror film that has come before it and you'll be hooked after the first episode. Of course, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is not for the faint of heart or people easily scared by things that go bump in the night even if it is only on TV. AMERICAN HORROR STORY is beyond all horror and thrillers you have ever seen.<br />AMERICAN HORROR STORY is an actor's dream. There is depth to the characters and we see them over and over. This show was also a casting director's dream (or maybe nightmare). I can't imagine a more thoroughly perfect cast. Everyone plays his or her role with true delight. I could easily spend pages delving into each character and actor but let me start with one of the best. Jessica Lange is at her absolute best as freaky neighbor Contance Langdon. She puts the C in creepy and gee, she is not even one of the dead people in the show. She is attached heart and soul to the picturesque Victorian mansion next door.<br />New buyers Ben Harmon (Dylan McDermott), his wife Vivien (Connie Britton) and daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) have the misfortune of moving into the house after a couple of family tragedies. Little do they know they have moved into LA's infamous \\"murder house.\\" These three actors are just perfect for their roles. Britton can tell stories of joy, sadness and fear just from her facial expressions. Farmiga is the perfect troubled teen trying to make sense of a crazy world.<br />The fun of AMERICAN HORROR STORY is watching each episode and learning about the \\"people\\" who share murder house with the Harmons. Try not to learn to much of the plot ahead of time and just watch everything unravel. Who is dead and who isn't? Murder House is the a place of eternal misery. People who die in that house, whether by murder or natural causes, never leave.<br />Another fascinating character is Jamie Brewer as Addie, Constance's daughter who was born with Down's Syndrome.<br />Brewer is great in her role. Is she evil or just a victim of a horrible parent. She sees dead people. Then there is Evan Peters as Tate. Another great role of a trouble teenager with a seriously troubled past.<br />So many characters have connections that should be revealed as you watch the series and not in a review.<br />And to add to the mix, we have Frances Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge as the mysterious housekeeper Moira O'Hara?<br />Why two actresses in one role? You'll find out soon enough and it's a stunner. Both actresses are perfect in their roles. Another standout is Kata Mara as Hayden McClaine. If you're having trouble with your ex-mistress, just wait until she is dead and starts visiting your wife!<br />Another of my favorites is Zachary Quinto as one-half of the dead gay couple that lives in the house. You see my point about not knowing too much about the plot before you start watching? Such great writing and it makes me wonder what nightmares the writers were having to come up with all this horror and thrills.<br />Watching this great cast interact is part of the fun of AMERICAN HORROR STORY. We get to learn the back story of this house built in the 1920's for a famous doctor and his wife and son. Here is the beginning of the murder house.<br />AMERICAN HORROR STORY also makes references to the 1940's murder of Elizabeth Short known forever as \\"The Black Dalia\\" and even the murder of actor Sal Mineo in the 1970's. Nothing is left unturn and no subject is taboo.<br />AMERICAN HORROR STORY is addictive but it does have plenty of plot holes. We never know why the house seems to have a life and power of its own and why it feeds on human tragedy. Why are the souls trapped? Why do Constance and Addie see dead people? I could go on and on with questions but just sit back and enjoy these creepiest and scariest ride of your life.
1451662432|5.0|I read autobiographies to learn success principles. This one doesn't disappoint. It's full of - here's what I did and here's how I did it. He invested in apartment buildings and other real estate along Santa Monica's main street.  He used his lessons learned in bodybuilding to garner success in business (real estate investing) and movies. Driven to turn one dollar into two. Only wish he would have read the whole book to us rather than just a small part.
B009JNXK88|5.0|One downside to switching from Apple products to Android is sometimes you have to say good bye to your favorite app. LoE was my favorite game, and finding here in Android is a very happy surprise! Thanks Noodlecake for porting this, and Ravenous for creating it!<br /><br />A word of caution to downloaders: this is a hardcore game, (some label it a &quot;precision platformer&quot;), and you will die a LOT. Don't give it a bad rating because you don't like the genre or you're bad at it, because League of Evil is the best of its kind.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|I think this could be the best episode yet. I've been watching all of the episodes up to this point, and this one really keeps the plot going. Besides that, it's one of the most emotionally intense videos I've ever seen. Normally I wouldn't write reviews, but this episode deserves a high rating, and a \\"heads up\\" for those about to watch it.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|There was no real ending. Too many characters had no resolution to their situation. I'm sorry I read book 4 or book 5.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Nobody could ever accuse Pete Townshend of avoiding the truth.  This is a kick-ass tell-all filled with amazing details about not only Pete, but The Who.  I've been a Who fan all my life and I thought I knew if not everything, almost everything, about the group, but Who I Am fills in all the blanks.  A very entertaining read.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I bought this on Sept. 23rd, it took it about a month to arrive, which was fine, I was notified about the delay. I wish it had a strap with Velcro to keep it closed instead of the elastic band. When I set it up to view whatever I'm doing at the time I wasn't happy about it slipping down, so I took the soft side of a piece of Velcro tape with a self adhesive back about two inches long and adjusted my Kindle Fire HD where I was comfortable viewing and stuck it to the outside of the case. Now it doesn't slide down when I'm using my Kindle Fire HD. It's very easy to put the Kindle Fire HD in and easy to take it out. So I'm pretty much happy with the case. A couple of simple improvements and it could be perfect.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked the book. The 2 main characters have a lot of issues between themselves and hopefully they can overcome them.  MS. Day is a good writer compared to E.L. James. Am looking forward to reading \\"Entwined\\".
B0061S0A64|4.0|a really cool game but it could definitely use an audio boost. it's rather quiet in my kindle fire, but the app is awesome so it doesn't matter. lots of options and it has a nice soothing sound too. I find it fun to keep putting nodes out and see when it finally crashes. it takes a while and even when its a mess, it still sounds like music.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I must say that I very much enjoyed this book....although I am not sure I was supposed to.  I admire the skill, loyalty and commitment our troops demonstrate in the protection of our country.  However, it was very disturbing to think that we send young men like Mr. Kyle into places were the people are so desperate and dysfunctional that they send children out to retrieve RPGs.
B00979CS50|5.0|...WHAT AN INCREDIBLE CD WITH CRAZY HORSE ! ! !  NEIL HAS BECOME YOUNG AGAIN WITH HIS BAND ; SIGNATURE SOUND NEIL HERE ... ! ! !

CRANK IT UP EVERYONE AND REACH THE STARS BECAUSE NEIL HAS RETURNED WITH HIS BAND ...
B005YVSIZ4|5.0|The Walking dead is a grabbingly good series of thought provoking science fiction TV.  I could do with a little less blood but it is also filled with human conserns, values and feelings that keep you thinking about the real world you live in.
B007CM9AMI|2.0|Big Bruce fan (his music, not his political activities) and I really loved Magic and Working on a Dream, and his older stuff of course. This album seems to be all over the place and missing some of the drive of his other recent work. Usually after a month and a few times through a Bruce album, I'm totally in love with it. That didn't happen this time.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Although this book was a great read, and brings everything together for the reader...but itjumps around a lot. The plot keeps thickening but you don't know what to believe most of the time, and the characters are going from one place to the next.....ine thing is that the ending is great! And if you get through all the hoop jumps its worth the ending!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great app for quick last minute purchases, for more in depth exploration of amazon you will still need the web browser. Over all great app.
B000G6R7B8|4.0|Great watch.  Nice smooth movement.  Easy on the eyes.  Reasonable priced.  Fits well on the arm without a lot of distractions.<br />Wish the numbers were reversed on the dial with hours on the outside.<br />Okay so stop sending me watch ads now.
B0083DJUMA|4.0|Pretty entertaining read, with many new ideas. Not a do it yourself book though. A lot of the stuff he shares is not yet ready for prime time. Would have liked more specifics.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I read this series based on reviews that it similar to the hunger games, which I loved. The Maze runner was just ok, but when I started reading the scorch trials, I couldn't put it down! It is one often best reads, and keepers you guessing the whole time!
B009FZFONO|5.0|best show on tv EVER and it keeps getting better! it exciting trilling scary dramatic and shocking you just never know what going to happen next!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|The author is one of my favorites and I have waited for her new book to arrive. Patricia Cornwell had to really reach to tie the plot together. Her writting style was engaging as always, but the plot was not.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mocking jay is a great ending to this trilogy.....I love how it ends,and power that is inside katniss. Best book series I have read in a long time!
B009AJD5E0|2.0|****NO SPOILERS****<br />Seriously. I was excited to see this movie.<br />But in no way did it live up to the hype. Disappointing would an understated. Yes, visually it was great. But, do you go to a movie just for the CGI?<br />It was plodding and disjointed due its massive moral prerogative.<br />Poor choices in stars who delivered lackluster performances.<br /><br />The major paradox in this movie is how can it be so dull and slow and yet feel as if they are trying to rush the story line.<br />Poor job by Mr Scott in the directors chair.
B004SF30HI|5.0|After watching Rio at least twice a day for several weeks I bought this sound track and instituted it as a compromise.  We listen, we dance and we give the movie a rest.  The children are convinced we should move there.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|The book was ok. It was a little slow, andnotas frightening as I thought it should have been. BUT it is worth it to get into the scorch trials and he death cure! Great reads!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Very similar to five people u meet in heaven.,  I did  Like It but it was not his best work.
B00884GR0W|2.0|This game can be very fun giving quests and other tasks to achieve during the game and can be mildly fun at first. To me however, not as good as minecraft. If you like free roaming gams with no campaign-ish stuff... This game is not for you
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Best book series I have read in a long time! It keeps you entertained, and guessing!
B0052RDHTM|2.0|Very long and not a very easy read.  I found it boring and had to really concentrate for it to krrp my attention
B004RJMUJO|4.0|over all the game is fun but the new upgrade made me loose all my blades and backgrounds but I still like the game.
0099443244|5.0|This book was a totally new slant on Luck and how it works, this would be a great book for everyone in high school to read and then re-read periodically to get the principles into our subconscious mind. It was exremely benifical to me.
B007ORVC36|5.0|This is a great TV series-some of the props remind me of when I was growing up in the 50's. Characters are well-developed and convincing.
B007FC3AAI|4.0|Typical twilight movie that has moved on in storyline. A twilight fan should like it. Liked rosalie wanting to protect the baby. After watching the others this one should follow.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I pick this up once a day to collect and check on scrat's game, you never need to spend real money if you take it slow. Additionally, it is ice age and my son loves that.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|This movie is fan-freaking-tastic. It is such a ride, from beginning to end. The blu-ray looks amazing on our 40\\" TV.<br /><br />I would have liked more special features. There isn't much more besides a few short featurettes and the director's commentary, but perhaps I'm spoiled by blu-ray sets like LOTR and Star Wars.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest, this website is so inspiration and exciting. After a hards day work I love to come home and find fun a crafty things I can do with my daughter, or make something nummy for my family to eat. Thank you for such a great thing to share with people all over the world.
B009CGYO0K|2.0|This book is not for a Kindle, the screen is too small to read the type in images. No way to enlarge to read. I tried to download to my I-Pad with larger screen(with Kindle app) but unsuccessful.
B003VXP2Q0|5.0|Amazon Prime Instant Video is a GREAT, Easy, and Affordable way to watch tv shows and movies. Great quality picture and you can pay a little extra to get HD quality. There is a great selection too.  I love Veronica Mars! It is a great show! All of the episodes are great; well acted, written and directed. This one is no different. Thanks Amazon for including this and so many other wonderful tv shows and movies on your Instant Video.
B000FC0ZAI|5.0|I just want to say I hope lawsuits are continuing go be forthcoming on collusion to keep e-book prices so high.... I mean seriously, there's no production cost yet it costs the same for the paperback as it does for Kindle.  NOT FUNNY.

B0097EWK3A|4.0|Fun game but a little buggy. Game would not let me progress at one point. Had to reinstall game and start over.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I have always been partial to the looks and feel of Tim Burton's movies. This movie was fun to watch.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|A sweet, quirky, funny movie by a great director.that parents and kids will enjoy.  There are very few family movies out there that don't make the parents want to run screaming from the room.  This is a rare find.
B007SGM084|5.0|The Best three books I have ever read. Took me 5 days to finish and I am in complete awe!

B0097C8XL0|5.0|ok this is WAY better than temple run I should know because I have temple run and temple run brave. anyway it is more exciting than both of the other temple rums. I mean does temple fun have falling icecicles falling from the sky?  NO it does not. way more fun and challenging. Get this app I mean its free right? so get it : ) find other of my reveiws on star wars angry birds, minecraft, prize claw, and jetpack joyride. hope this helped
B005K01VZS|5.0|Good read! Inspiring. Caused me to think about what life is, and should be about. I will get more by giving than getting.
1401322786|5.0|This book was so good that I read it in one day. I couldn't put it down. Who of us hasn't wasted time, wanted to speed up time, or taken advantage of free time? What would life be without clocks, a way to measure our precious time with loved ones? Would we love more freely, be more grateful for the moments we spend together? This book really compels you to think about the impact of how we as a society are obsessed with time keeping and it's something I honestly can say I haven't thought about much. I went to basic training for the military when I was 19 years old, and I remember since I couldn't have my cell phone (yes, I had withdrawals!) my wrist watch was one of the only comforts I had, because I could count down the days and hours til my training was over. What if watches were never invented? What would we all do without a calendar?
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I sincerely liked this book.  It kept me on my toes throughout the story.  If I had to change one thing, it would be to cut down on all the French language.  I found it distracting.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|[[ASIN:B0036TGT3E The Lion King (Two-Disc Diamond Edition Blu-ray / DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]]<br /><br />The lion king on blu ray! Boy, does it look good! A movie that I've watched probably more than 10 times, but it never gets old.<br /><br />The immaculate soundtrack, excellent animation, along with a wonderful story and screenplay makes it a timeless classic. Full 5 stars from me!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So easy to use.wonderful for balancing your checkbook!! A must have! Hats that I didn't have it sooner! Love it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was better than the first.  I liked the first book but if your an adult this one makes you really think about what it is to be powerful and what it is to be suppressed.
B008COII1Y|5.0|If you are a fan of Zombies, this to me was a masterpiece. It take place after the US Civil war. A plague that gets explained near the middle of the movie. It starts out kind of average, a man, a Confederate soldier loses his wife and son to the plague and tries to kill himself but fate won't let him die. So he sets out to honor his son by scattering his ashes into a place his son wanted to see one day. Then he makes a friend along the way. They rescue his sister from ex soldiers looking for a cure to the plague by experimenting on live prisoners.<br /><br />This movie is philosophical, has historical content, lots of Zombies, lots of killing, a depiction of how the plague began, and a grand finale at the end with a gun duel. No stupid typical ending...I get so sick of those dumb ass endings where you are finally content and satisfied and then either the hero is killed or the movie tries to depict a reemergence of the terror at the end. No this movie ends happily, but suggests love and the will to live ever after catastrophe. It is a rarity and though the 1st 30 minutes or so only depicted suffering and I was kind of bored, it got very good and I was compelled to see it through.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|loved the movie. well done. stuck to the script in almost every detail. didn't like the main actress but loved the main actor...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|exciting and fun like temple run but WAY! better if your getting this game it depends on what your into if not into action don't get it
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I was up till 2:30am i literally could not put it down. Start to finnish in two days (i have 3 kids nearly impossible to find time to read but i found time for this)!!!!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to everyone. Blake crouch has a gift for suspense.. Keep your attention from beginning to the end.
0307959856|4.0|I was happy to see so many authors have carried the story of Darcy and Elizabeth forward.  I enjoyed reading it, and sped right through it.  I hightly recommend it.
B00687PWQG|5.0|The John Adams series is one of the very best I have ever seen. It stays true to the book and true to history. I would not recommend children view this without parents blocking two scenes. The quality of the audio and video were good. I would recommend this series to my friends.
B000WT7R6O|5.0|Supernatural is an absolutely fabulous series and watching it on the bus everyday on my Kindle Fire makes the one hour comute bearable while saving fuel and helping the environment!  Way to go Sam and Dean!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell keeps you thinking - some of the puzzles are just plain difficult.  Great challenge.  Let's get some more levels!
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You is more realistic to me. The Plot is great. The characters are not perfect and everyone has a pass. And the sex is wonderful. In Fifty, i was tired of the same old sex till the point I was skipping over it. But in Bared to You, i had found myself going back to read over those parts. The sex is hot and it does not involve beatings. AWESOME...The characters are sexy and wicked. I missed reading the book.I dared you to try it. Christian Grey is a boy but Gideon Cross is a MAN
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This was such a fun movie.  The boys and I loved it.  We couldn't decide who was our favorite Avenger.  They were all wonderful. Can't wait for the next one.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Got all my news from here<br />the ones that I want<br />its really great<br />and you can make it yours
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Keep your expectations low and don't think about the plot too much and it's a good movie. Probably closer to 3.5 stars rather than 4, but I'm feeling generous today.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|So much nicer than Youtube. Cleaner look &amp; easier to search. Changed from low setting to high &amp; videos look fantastic.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids love it. They would play it for hours if I'd let them. Totally recommend this app.  It's great.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|This is the revenge of the nerds for today.  The programers save the world.  It's a little unrealistic that the super-geek played rugby in college and his girlfriend happens to be a hot computer science PhD, but it's a fun story regardless.
034580404X|4.0|I found the trilogy very interesting. You must read all three books though. They may not be for every reader.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|Abercrombie's fantasy world is expanded with yet another great book. Many familiar characters are met again, a few of them being my personal favorites from previous books. Abercrombie is the best modern low fantasy or really any fantasy I've read, so I recommend this.
