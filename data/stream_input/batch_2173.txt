B00003W8NM|3.0|This Special  edition DVD was supposed to have a special sleeve for a book with some art from the movie. The sleeve was there but it was empty...
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I think I like the book and want to own the whole series.  and more and more painful if i buy more than one product.
B0043VDIAG|4.0|Many years ago I found myself reading a lot of novels by Nicholas Sparks. He does have a way with storytelling and the romance is always so sweet, but then I started to notice a trend. You are not always guaranteed a happy ending with Sparks and that scares me. I’m not saying I must always have a happy ending but I seem to gravitate toward them. I don’t mind characters being put through multiple trials and tribulations but in the end... well in the end I want them happy and together. I want to see that through it all, the ups and downs, they find their way to their very own happy ever after.<br /><br />So why now, you may ask? Why go back to a Nicholas Sparks book when I was unsure as to how it was going to end? I was at the cinema last week and saw the preview for the film due to be released soon and that sealed it for me. The story looked great and when I want to see a film and I know for certain there is a book it is based off of then I always want to read the book first so, I did. And I am very happy to say I was not disappointed.<br /><br />“That's the thing about life. A lot of the time, it isn't easy at all. We just have to try to make the best of it.”<br /><br />Safe Haven has just enough suspense, mystery and of course romance. You can’t help but fall in love with Katie and Alex and cheer for them to make it through all the crazy that is Katie’s past. What is that crazy? Katie is running from her abusive, alcoholic husband Kevin. And to say he is crazy is a true understatement. The man is a lunatic and the scenes that follow him were intense. I was on edge waiting to see what he would do next and rooting for Katie to get free.<br /><br />“I've come to believe that in everyone's life, there's one undeniable moment of change, a set of circumstances that suddenly alters everything.”<br /><br />Katie is a loveable character and Alex is sweet, caring and romantic. But above all I fell in love with Alex’s children, Josh and Kristen. They are adorable and you instantly fall in love with them both.<br /><br />Sparks has always had his own style of writing. You not only get drawn into the characters but also the location. Safe Haven is no exception, it takes place in Southport, North Carolina and it is beautiful. The cozy cottages, the small town, the ocean... it is lovely and is the perfect backdrop for a new romance.<br /><br />“‎When she looked up at him, it was suddenly easy for her to imagine that her fears were pointless. That he would love her no matter what she told him, and that he was the kind of man who loved her already and would love her forever.”<br /><br />So... through everything are you wondering if there is a happy ever after? Well I am not going to give that away because I strongly recommend that you read this if you enjoy Nicholas Sparks or if you enjoy a nice romantic story with great characters. I have to say that this has probably been one of my favorite books by Sparks. Yes it took the film being released to get me to read it but thankfully I did because it really is a lovely story.<br /><br />“I love you, Katie. You might not be ready to say those words now, and maybe you'll never be able to say them, but that doesn't change how I feel about you.”<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readsrable and you instantly fall in love with them both.<br /><br />Sparks has always had his own style of writing.

B005BPTLIQ|5.0|My two daughter enjoy this serie as any other. Even older people have great time at watching it. I liked a lot.
1616550414|5.0|this is beautiful. that is all i have to say about this. i need eight more words for this review
B004LWZW24|5.0|This movie is really scary and it scared me alot it has everything you want in a typical horror movie it is awesome!!
B008NW67IQ|4.0|I might need to listen to more to get a better appreciation but believe a lot of their music sounds similar.  Put them in the ipod and hit random and all is okay but they get a bit old listening to one song after another.  But add a real nice variety to the random selection.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|I enjoyed this book like I enjoy all Iain M Banks books but it was ridiculously priced for an ebook AND lending wasn't enabled. Greedy swine.
B00000DF6O|5.0|You can't beat B. B. King for the Blues! No one can do better!  Would love to sit on the porch with him!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game!  I enjoy playing for hours on end. The only thing that I get mad at is not having the energy to play more!  It's a great game to have on my kindle now I can play it where ever I am.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was very well written....I loved the authors style of writing.  The characters were engaging.  Great dialogue!!  The only critique I have is that I wished the story would have progressed a little faster.  I would definitely recommend this book!!
B005FRF6PC|5.0|You get to know a Nadal up close that is a direct opposite of his public personna. But that's not the reason for the 5 stars. The book is awesomely written, with his first Wimbledon title as the backdrop. The sacrifices he made, the emotions he felt and the attitude he carries, make this my best tennis book ever, much better than Agassi's Open and Andy Murray's premature autobiography, which was also surprisingly good.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|The best compilation of Stones hits yet. This is a 3-part CD, covering the early 60's hits thru the 90's. Highly recommend this
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app. my friend recommended it to me and I have been addicted ever since. Yay temple run!
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|The action continues. The best thing about this series is that it's rarely predictable. It seems there's a new twist around every corner.
B009TSA7MA|5.0|Sound quality good, video good! As a fellow guitar player, I was impressed with the show! A must for Michael Schenker fans!
B004J4XGN6|3.0|Enjoyed the book, but it's a lot of common sense.  There are a few good points (like experimenting w/ different models, marketing, etc.), but there's also a lot of repetition.  The book should be a lot thinner than it is.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|With all the hype I expected a good Zombie book. What I got was political propaganda. A can't speak for the whole book, because I quit after 25%, but the characters seemed to fall into two categories: Those who tried to do something and were apologetic, and those who didn't do anything but try to save themselves and they were angry with those who tried to do something. If you are very far left leaning you will probably enjoy the views of military personnel and business people. If you are a normal person you will be disappointed. Spend your time well...elsewhere.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Just couldn't put this book down. Read in less than a day. Great story with wonderful lessons. Highly recommended. Will make you laugh and cry.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Nice unit to scan slides and film. Very easy to work with and does allow for slight adjustment to the film. Mirror and flip features are VERY handy. Plastic film holders have to be very clean, any spots will be picked up by the scanner. Unit is very sensitive. All in all, a nice item for the price but the customer service is second to none. Very responsive and accomodating. Great to work with as company that cares !!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! SO so worth reading!!<br />If you have a kindle you'll like even more, so easy to read!! Xo
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Wonderful series, of the class system in English Earldom.<br />From the fabulous  rascal Dame Maggie Smith - &#34;real people&#34;.down stairs.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game often does not work and I paid for extra game stuff and never recieved them. I spent 3 month in talks with there customer service and them eventaully telling me there was nothng they could do or would do and that I would just be out the money. GAME DELETED.
1410454983|5.0|My husband is really enjoying this book and hopes to get more Tom Clancy books in large print as he loves Clancy's books and can't read them unless they are in Large Print.  He has not told me much about the book, but is reading it everyday.<br />  f/Robert Lacourse
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I didn't even buy this but i had to comment on it to get it off my wall-thingy grrrr. That being said, i wouldn't have liked it even if i HAD bought it, though, its just not my style
B009O2XY12|4.0|I have fun playing this game. I do not really understand the game but I like it. I recommend this game.

B001GCUNWQ|5.0|All my movies are starting to get worn out so I bought this one alson with a few others and the kids love it. They watch it about once a week, along with some of their other favorites.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Great CD...... nuff said! Adelle is awesome, terrific, stupendous, super spectacular, practically perfect in every way ( this dang review is making write at least 30 words... am i there yet???).  * phew( I'm running out of adjectives)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm so glad I found this app, it's a great way to relax when you're not feeling well. Although you can by credits, you don't have to in order to get great games.
B001CTGQBK|3.0|I looked forward to watching this movie, but I unfortunately found out in the first few minutes that this movie revolves around sex. Although there are some great dancers, the dance moves have a sexual connotation. I would not show this movie to your kids.
B008N2Z1L0|2.0|Not what I thought it would be. One or two good tracts the rest just okay.  A bit dissapointing.  Oh well.
B003AO1SVS|2.0|As with most CDs, every song isn't good; thank goodness for iTunes!! However, it came quick and i. Good shape, no problems there
B005EWDA9M|5.0|I heard mixed reviews before a read it, so I wasn't sure but from page 1 I was completely hooked. I love Murakami's way of making the strange and magical seem so possible. Can't wait to start book 3
B0076DELIG|5.0|MIchael Connelly is my favorite author.  I have read all of his books, and anxiously await the release of his next novel.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is so much fun. It never seems to get boring. I am not sharing with the grandkids. OK. Maybe.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|So we really enjoyed watching this in 3D.  We are coming from the DVD version so this was a huge step up for us in our household.  It was amazing how well the 3d was done in the aerial sequences.  We actually had to stop the movie because my wife got really dizzy in one of the parts.  The picture is way better than the non-anamorphic DVD we upgraded from.<br /><br />I will say, I normally appreciate film grain from older movies (and especially appreciate that there's no CGI) but it did seem very disjointed to have so much of the original film grain in scenes and then almost none in others. I have no doubt we saw all the excessive grain since it was in the original film now enhaced by BR quality and I'm sure there was a reason the scenes it was 'heavy' in were not 'alterable' without sacrificing picture quality.  However, I have to deduct a star since it was a distraction for a few small moments.<br /><br />Overall though, very happy with the 3D.  It'll definitely get another run through in our house in the future.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follett gives us a history lesson wrapped in a great story.  Can't wait for the third book in this trilogy.
B0031TZASY|5.0|GREAT BOOK!  Couldn't put it down!  You will want to keep reading until it is done!  Buy it and enjoy.
0345803485|5.0|I LOVED THE BOOK SO MUCH I BOUGHT A COPY JUST SO I COULD HAVE IT.  EASY READ, INTERESTING AND CAPTIVATING
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I am simply in love with the series and I can't wait to read the rest.... Best story lines ever.
B007C94XG4|5.0|This movie on kindle fire makes it easy to go to the gym and have my 8 year old twins occupied.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This movie is lovely! It is nostalgic and heart warming. I'm thrilled to have my own copy and will watch it over and over!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I loved the movie.  I remember the time well.  It was during the time of the Miracle USA hockey team win.  It was when the hostages were taken and the Soviets had invaded Afghanistan.  It is imbecilic to compare 2009 with 1979.  After all, there was no Shah as a bone of contention in 2009 or the Ayatollah Khomeini, either.  There was no revolution going on, get real, get a grip.  Go compare apples to it.  The oranges aren't working.  They walked their dim witted behinds on their own over that border and were not representing their country like these 6 and the other hostages.  Poetic license may have been taken, fine but it does not take away from what could have ended in all their deaths.  Not just jail because you pretended you were lost instead of calling it what it was tresspassing and getting caught.  I love my cheese but you can keep the whine.
B009EEFTMC|2.0|I thought it would be great. but its so easy. You can clear any pair of tiles; they don't have to be freed first - so there's no real strategy. The untimed mode has score multipliers, but since there's no strategy beyond working fast it seems pointless. The timed mode is fast. it adds more tiles in some increment of time seemingly unrelated by gameplay itself.  Then you can't even see your score for the game without using the Amazon Game Circle or whatever its called.<br /><br />It would be much more fun with play bonuses. like for perfect strings of matches without hitting a stray tile. or for matching X number pairs within the same tile theme. or score multiply for each pair tip you have to rotate the cube.<br /><br />As it stands Cubistry is not worth paying for - I'd have been angry if I wasted money on it. There's a good premise here, but to stand out or make players interested in coming back for more, it needs bonuses or additional challenge play modes. And the ability to see personal top scores without needing Internet.
B0068FYZV6|5.0|The movie is amazing, hilarious, and fun to watch!!! I am so glad I bought this movie, everyone in my family loves it!!!
B00A50PE6K|5.0|Easy listening to great songs sung in a fresh way. Lighten your day with this reminder of the past today.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I hate, I mean HATE when I am doing anything with an app that is &#34;free&#34; and have to be interupted by adds.  This one is annoying.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A fast-paced, slow-moving mystery that engages the intersections of mind,  youth and history, allowance together in a light and gripping tale.  An excellent read.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Who can doubt that this is one of the best and most entertaining match games ever.  It looks great and works well and I love it.
B00846REIS|4.0|Alot like 50, but I different enough to keep my attention. Ready for the next book.  Like the story line.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This a very powerful app.  It allows the more advanced user to manipulate files in any way that is needed.
0307592731|4.0|Great read. More sad than I expected it to be during the beginning, but opened up into a great book!
0817439390|5.0|Haven't read it but it was highly recommended.I hope to learn from this book and become a better photographerwith it'
B005LAJ212|5.0|I love Revenge and purchased the 1st season to be given as a gift. This show is full of twists and turns and draws you in. It is great!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Of all the Batman movies, this one left a bit to be desired.  It had great effects, but the story was not that great.
B000RZOR2U|5.0|I love all my cantata conductors - particularly Suzuki, Koopman, Richter and Gardiner - but find Harnoncourt (in particular) the most powerful magician of them all. I'm not musician enough to be able to analyse how, out of the rawness and vitality of these performances, he conjures transcendence.
B009ETEEAU|1.0|first time I tried to use this the power button stuck in the down position and will not come turn on.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so awesome, I love it! The graphics are amazing and I love the new save me feature.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loaded this on my Kindle for our trip to Hawaii.  While I could marginally watch what the weather was back home, the app kept tellilng me that the weather was 40 degrees in Waikaloa Hawaii.  I am sure they have never even seen 40 there!  By the way, it was really 82.  This was a consistant occurance with this app.  I removed it from my device.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|I have kindle fire hd.  The camera is tricky to use.  This app helped me manage my files.  If in doubt, get it.<br />It helped me.  It may help you, too.
0393338398|5.0|This book was delivered on time and in great condition.<br />I haven't read it yet, but if it's as good as the movine, I will be very happy.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|It was ok.  The trailer had made me think I wanted to purchase it.  I'm glad I didn't since it's not a movie I am interested in seeing again.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love it. It's great on the kindles larger screen. It's the same as it is I<br />on my iPod and phone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Interesting story which kept me scrolling. Couldn't  put it down on the second  day. Fresh, passionate and real. Good read
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|No cool gadgets, lengthy and seemingly slow or dull in parts. Could have had a but more action like Casino Royal or Quantum. Cheesy Villain!
014241039X|4.0|In the Twits by Roald Dahl there are 2 nasty people named Mr. Twit and Mrs. Twit.  Mr. Twit wants to outwit each other to do pranks.  Mrs. Twit and Mr. Twit want the monkeys to stop gluing the twits on the carpet but…they wouldn’t.  So then the twits got mad and started to yell.<br /><br /> I love the Twit. I couldn’t stop reading the book.  The Twits was hilarious because the Twits were  playing  jokes on each other. For example Mrs. Twit put worms in the spaghetti and made Mr. Twit eat it. I enjoyed the figurative in the Twits. For example Mr. Twit ate the spaghetti as slow as a turtle. I praise this book to other people that like fantasy .
B000JVSUS4|4.0|I was disappointed at first that it was not labeled as DTS. I don't know why it's labelled uncompressed digital sound, but the movie sounds great and picture is perfect. This is a great deal.Amazon provides great deals to their customers.
0783230079|5.0|This movie is a nice ghost story. The ghosts are so believable and I love the actors who play them. The boy who plays the young Robert Downey Jr. is perfect for the part. This is one of Robert Downey Jr's better roles.  It's a feel good movie.  I recommend it to everyone.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|don't think replayability is a word, but this game is fun.  there are several levels to work though that are just hard enough to challenge you.  it is not too difficult, but still challenging enough to make you want to earn your way.<br /><br />One complaint is the load time on start-up, but no points off from me since app warns you &#34;loading... this may take a minute&#34;.  After loading, I have never had a problem with the game locking on my Fire HD
B005DTX2PS|4.0|In Rolald Dahl’s book Fantastic Mr. Fox , there are two disgusting old people named  Mr. and Mrs. Twit.  They wanted to keep doing tricks on each other.  Their tricks continued until they put glue on the tree to catch birds.  They got revenge from the monkeys and the ducks for doing tricks, and for putting glue on the tree to catch birds to make bird pie.<br /><br />This book is amazing because it is a book full of suspense.  It is full of figurative language. This is some figurative language, simile, metaphor, alliteration, hyperbole, onomatopoeia, this book was also hilarious. For example the description of the characters was hilarious. I urge you to read this outstanding book.
0321885112|4.0|Sketchnoting is not for every situation in life, sometimes you can get big eyes if you'r caught doodling your boss in a meeting rather than carefully writing every word.<br />Yet, it's a very nice book, that goes deep in the subject of sketchnoting, and better, that makes you want to try !<br /><br />I'd give a 5 stars for the book only, the video edition is a 4 star only rating because the videos are just a straight copy of what's in the book. The exemples are the same, and so are most of the punchlines.<br />The live visualisation of the sketchnoting is important, but the global video concept is a bit disappointing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is my favorite game of all time!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait for temple run 3!!!!!! if it is as amazing as the 2 I'm filled excitement!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Get this for your kids! No one says bad words,or anything like that! When I have kids, I'm getting it so they can play it. I play all of this &quot;Story&quot; series and they are all really fun!
0142424277|5.0|In Matilda by Roald Dahl a 4 year old girl named Matilda wants her parents to be compassionate and for them to understand she's  unique and adores books. However they don't understand she's unique and she has another problem, the Trunchbull.  One day Matilda unleashes her powers on the Trunchbull.  Will it scare the Trunchbull of?  Will her powers work? Will she get what she wants?<br /><br />  I adored Matilda.  It was an outstanding book.  Matilda was an action packed book and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  When Miss Trunchbull throws a girl from her pigtails over a sharp fence I thought that was action packed.  I loved the character Matilda, for example, she was so intelligent and had wonderful power, and bravery.  I wanted to be like Matilda.  I advice this incredible, lovely, outrageous book to a sixth grader who loves suspense, magic, and bravery.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it. I have read it countless times. Wonderful story. Has it all, love, heartache, suspense. I've recommended it to everyone I know
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I was reading then I fell asleep to the narration! Thanks for a wonderful night Amazon what a true gem.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is Dragon Story, a fun-filled game with mythical creatures, called dragons.  In this game, you get to evolve dragons into bigger and tougher versions of the old ones. I really like this game and I think you will too! P. S. Add me! My Storm8 is Doglover564 =3
B007FTZDN8|1.0|Thought it was the same appt. IPad4  had.so don't get excited. I really didn't understand what I what I was looking for myself...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I already have over a score of over 4,200,000<br />it is so much fun get bary bones I am trying to get all the upgrades first
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I loved the movie but I wish I could have bought it in full screen. I don't like wide screen because sometimes it cuts off the heads.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Delirium was a great story and beautifully written. If you like The Hunger Games I would recommend these books as well. They project the future America in a very intriguing light. I am currently reading the sequel to this book Pandimoium. It is proving to be just as good as Delerium
B003O86FMW|5.0|This has got to be one of the best books i have ever read or will ever read in my life
B009OYTOA0|5.0|Best show on TV. After watching Smallville was worried about the actor they chose to play Arrow. The CW made the perfect choice. Great show with a great story and cast.
0765325950|5.0|book was in perfect shape well packaged and arrived on time. I have to add nine more words, now two more
B007S3S8HO|5.0|A lot of fun, a 6 year old will need help putting it together, but totally a hit! The boys loved it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It had so much suspense . I could not stop reading.i highly recommend this book . Great for 5th grade and up.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It was kind of corny scifi. Definitely not an action movie for my movie library. The plot was kind of redundant.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Not what I expected. I would recommend this to anyone who traditionally reads non fiction, but is looking for a short, lighter read between business books.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Awful! I can't believe anyone enjoyed this book. There wasn't one character with depth.  If people actually act like this, our society is in trouble.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great book that is definitely recommended for people who don't see their purpose or have trouble  finding themselves. The letters threw me off in the beginning but I got used to it after a few pages. Every personality was astoundingly different and grasped the contrast within today's teens. I felt empathetic with Charlie's character. Not your ordinary teen novel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The only thing with is to create your own skin and to have rail roads!! :<br />;)<br /><br />Is herobrine still in the game?
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|So far this game does not have as much hidden object gaming as I had hoped, but it is still fun and interesting enough to keep me playing.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|This is a nice innocent sort of movie.  Funny bits, wraps up nicely.  Made my dad laugh A LOT.  Some nudity, but just butts.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I really enjoyed the theme. It represented current events and situations we all see, hear or read about. I am looking forward to the next season.
B00008CMR6|3.0|As die hard &#34;Duke&#34; fans it's hard to say when we don't like a JW movie. But it is what it is - bad acting ( We love Jennifer O'Neil but her acting was just as bad), just bad - we kept the movie just to remind us not to buy it again by mistake :). We could also say this wouldn't be DOVE movie review approved (cursing (though they never curse the Lord's name), lots of drinking, some nudity).<br />Just keep looking nothing to see here........
B000WQW988|5.0|This is a quintessential Unplugged for me, back when MTV was about music and not idiocy. I haven't watched it in ages, but I'm glad to own it, being a huge Nirvana fan in my teenage years.
B0000683DH|4.0|Considered to be the best of the original Star Trek teams transfer to the movies it is certainly a very enjoyable romp. The first movie was pretty ordinary unless, like many Trek fans, you enjoyed watching the old team getting back together. and in this case 'old' is appropriate.<br />This story is part of a trilogy within the series concerning Spock, WARNING! Spoiler alert, He dies in this one. Actually in this case that's like telling people about the boat sinking in Titanic.<br />Ricardo Montalbán swans about camping it up, over acting and quoting Shakespeare or somebody at  any given chance. It's great, By the way, have a box of tissues handy near the end. I didn't need them, I'm a man I used my shirt sleeve..
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Good story,easy read. A lot of unanswered questions at the end.  What was wrong with him anyway - autistic? Recommend it .
B004ULEEY8|4.0|Good old action flick.  Surround sound is a must.. . . . . . . . . . . .
B00005JNTX|4.0|A classic movie. I guess because it's an older one, I was able to get it used for a very affordable price!
B00005JKHP|3.0|This movie was one of the most anticipated movies for sci-fi fans the world over. Well, assuming their particular country of residence allowed them to view the television series. I hear that certain totalitarian regimes didn't like the ideals espoused in the series. Freedom, equality etc.<br />Sadly it turned out to be a bit of a mismash. Over produced, overly dramatic over acted. The end tried to be a bit of metaphysical showing of the development of mankind to the next level, whatever that means.<br />This is for the fans but it is worth a look see for interest sake. It is also worth remarking that this was the first movie, hence forward was developed the 'Odd numbered Star Trek movies are best' theory. As in 'Odd Good', 'Even Bad'
0066620996|5.0|My pleasure reading consists of business related books, and my library is full of great books, ok books, and not so great books.  Good to Great is a great book.  I've read the reviews on this book, good and bad, and my grading of a book is based on how much it informs me, gives me insight, motivates me, moves my own perceived reality, and presents ideas and innovation to conduct business differently.  With this grading, I give Good to Great a 5.  Yes, there are chapters and sections that have greater impact for me than others.  Interestingly enough, I picked up on different things the second time I read it (about 4 years apart).  Assuredly everyone reading can take away great nuggets that will help them in their business.  No question, everything you read ought to be filtered through the lens of questionable source, however don't loose the fact that this book does present specific areas to concentrate on (at least consider) to achieve a great and enduring company.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of Sons of Anarchy and bought this as soon as it became available. Came on time and with no damage of anykind!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Another reviewer stated this was just like being at the fair. I agree this is tons of fun! You will be playing for hours
B000E1MXSW|3.0|My wife loves classic movies, I do too but this isn't one I wanted. Anyway, it is a classic, I know it is well loved, sadly not by me! My wife loved it.<br />Sorry, that's all I can say.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Everyone I know loves Downton Abbey!  I haven't seen all of the episodes in season 3 yet, and I know there are some bad things that happen in it; well, that's &#34;real&#34; life.
6305754969|4.0|I've had this movie before. Not the best john Wayne movie, but a lot of humor.<br /><br />Robert Mitchum played the perfect drunk.<br /><br />The whole staff was good, and Josephine, and Marty Good looking actresses
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really enjoy this simple game.  I keep trying to get better and better.  It is the best game on my Kindle.  The only bad thing is that it says I have a screen name that is not mine.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|The first Reacher book I read was the tie on with the Tom Cruise movie. I usually wait till I see the movie first but I was in an airport and getting bored.so I grabbed it. That book was a decent read, enjoyable.<br />This is the first Reacher and as such it was 'all right'. I'm probably wrong but it felt some things had been left out when the company decided to Publish.<br />&#34;Look Lee we like the book but can you cut a couple hundred pages?&#34;.<br />As mentioned I have read others since, and am reading more, I and can confirm they are, over all, very entertaining Certainly great for a plane read.<br />By the way I too was very much aware of the significant physical differences between Cruise and the character. Reacher is 6' 3&#34;, Cruise isn't.
0525952926|4.0|Ken Follett's books are always interesting; having read the first one in this series, I'm finding this one very compelling. (Not finished yet.)
B0063GORYU|1.0|I couldn't get the hang of it. A tutorial would have been a major part in learning how to play.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Yesterday, finally, I got to read this book, thanks to the \\"kindness\\" of a friend who highly recommends it and lent me her own copy. I hated writing how bad it is, but given the fact that this book (trilogy) has sold tens of millions of copies, it should probably earn my respect. But then again, popularity isn't really a huge gauge for whether or not something is good--take major religions, for example.<br /><br />the writing's bad, the premise is incredible (Christian Grey is a 26-year-old billionaire--that's with a \\"B\\"), and there are lines that are just awkward and gave me that strange feeling like i want to punch someone in the nose. i approached this book somehow thinking \\"this is probably similar to nabokov's 'Lolita'\\" but how wrong i turned out to be.<br /><br />if you're in your teens and doesn't mind wasting time getting your juices flowing, then go read this and see what the fuss is about. but remember that there are erotica readables out there that are free and much shorter. otherwise, i don't see the point in proceeding to the next two books.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|being a full time college student means I don't get to read stuff like this more often because I'm always nose deep in text books, this is an amazing story though and I highly recommend it even though I am only a little more than halfway through it. it would be great if they eventually made this into movie that rivaled JFK but from an alternate reality perspective
1416594795|5.0|I found this book to be a fantastic compilation of past, current, and future scientific study of natural selection. While it is written from a scientist's perspective, and I too have that background, its messages transcend discipline. Dawkins' messages are succinct with clear evidence, and presented in a way interesting to many people. I highly recommend the book to all those curious about the argument over evolution.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I got this CD for my girlfriend as a surprise after she told me how much she liked &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34;. She likes the album, but she says it's pretty sad to listen to sometimes. This is a good present for a girl who needs something to listen to in the car.<br /><br />More than a year later, I still see her take it out sometimes!
0345803485|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest products that I have ever purchased. Although I did not get around to reading it the book did serve other various purposes such as:<br /> Made a great umbrella. You see it was raining after a long day at the proctology clinic and I had forgotten my umbrella in the car so I opened up the buck and held it over my head to protect me from the droplets of rain.<br /><br /> It makes a perfect place for cats to sleep (provided you place a blanket over it). I found that one out because my cat mittens uses everything but the bed I bought him to sleep in.<br /><br /> Makes a handy fly swatter when you don't have any news paper around. I can not touch a news paper for the ink that they use causes me to break out in a horrible rash.<br /><br /> Its good for covering your eyes while you sleep.<br /><br /> Makes Perfect kindling for when you are out camping with your kids and/or your wife.<br /><br />Now although it was great for all those things and many more I must also point out the few problems I had with this book.<br /><br /> It was not edible or at least it didn't taste edible when I tried to eat a few of the pages.<br /><br /> Although its good for covering your eyes does not make a good pillow when you are trying to sleep in the car because your bitch of a wife threw you out.<br /><br /> Can't be considered legal tender in most countries.<br /><br /> Does not make for a good pet.<br /><br /> Can not grant wishes.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|how can you go wrong with Game of Thrones? this product is just amazing! I look forward to watching game of thrones seasons for years to come!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Entertaining from the first page to the last.  Don't mess with Reacher.  It isn't healthy...  Loved this book from start to finish.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this app because the keyboard is nice &amp; big. The size of the numbers &amp; keys makes it less likely to press the wrong number,  as I often do with a cellphone calculator.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I enjoyed this book, although I wished it hadn't ended so haltingly, making me sadened with no next book (yet) to let me see what happens next. Although, I am grateful for the last chapter, because if it hadn't been there, I don't know what I would've done. But I wish this book had been in first person, because it would give more insight and it would make it more interesting.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love SwiftKey, especially with the new Flow update. I've seen tons of great upgrades to this app, and I've only ever had to pay once.<br /><br />The prediction is amazing, and it really does save you time when you're typing out a text or email. It sometimes the word it guesses will be next is a word that I couldn't remember! It has saved my butt more than a few times (IE: Meaning Oh, good but accidently putting oh God!) I like how it keeps track of your keystrokes saves stats, but I'll admit I don't look at it very often (or at all?).<br /><br />One of my favorite things is that it allows you to type in words that aren't in the dictionary. Some keyboards give you a really hard time if you want to type in a word that is similar to another word in the dictionary (Ie: Nooooooo). Some keyboards autocorrect it, which is a pain to have to retype.<br /><br />The Flow addition is not overhyped -- it really is pretty cool. I have successfully a whole sentence without lifting a finger. It's great!<br /><br />When they update, they really update. I usually get pretty stoked when I see there is an update available to SwiftKey.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that it is sometimes kinda hard to find symbols, but usually it's because I'm in a hurry.
0143119680|5.0|I can't wait to read the other books written by this author. Who knew that vampires could be so interesting. Although I have a special relationship with witches.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I've only played through to one of the 12 endings, and from all reports I got the worst ending of them all. Even so, this plays out as well as any mystery novel I've ever read. ^_^
B005QBKXSC|5.0|Have all of the Daughtry albums and I never get tired of listiening to them. Can honestly say with &#34;Break the Spell&#34; there is not one song that I do not like and pretty much goes for their other albums.  Can't wait for the next one!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is super fun and easy to play. The graphics are a great step up from the first game which were great already, not to mention the new dynamic paths as opposed to the straight paths in the first game. The power-ups are creative, something an ordinary person would not be able to come up with. The game play is unique and particularly enjoyable. All-in-all, this is one of the best free apps out there. Can't wait  to see what you guys come up with for the third one!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Only made it through half of the movie. I thought the story was so bad I didn't even care enough to finish watching it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Good mystery, 1st time I have read this author, basically I purchased to book because I was curious after attending the movie
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Christina has such a powerful voice and the album certainly covers great dance music along with some wonderful ballads.  Have had it about two months and enjoy listening when I can't find anything good on the radio on my drive to and from work and on the weekends around the house.
0307592731|2.0|There were certainly parts of this book I enjoyed, mostly about the trail, but all the crying done by the main character about situations and things that she could have easily changed, like her relationship with her husband, were too much for me.  The worse part was when she says she is sorry for all her cheating, but maybe it was right to do it; she's not sorry for cheating, heroine, ect.  I'm sorry, but that is not truly being sorry.  She did whatever she wanted to do whenever she wanted to do it and was never sorry, never worrying about the consequences. Hallmark of a selfish whiner. I rarely like to be so negative, but I think I was looking for for a transformative book about her experience in the woods, not a sobfest and justification for her love life stories.  A lot of people have issues like her and still treat themselves and their partners with much more respect.  If you are looking for a travel, woods, nature story, don't bother.  Just not what I thought it would be.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So well written! It has the perfect combination of a captivating storyline, sex appeal and twists and turns that made me want to keep reading to have all my questions answered.  Thanks, CH!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Too long, could have shortened up some of the details, like the ride to get to Montana, or the use of the courthouse jail.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was a great gift.  The price was great and the u.k. version is much better than the U.S. version
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|The Reader is a movie that you will either hate or love depending on your point of view. The story is so intimate and crafty for 2 strangers from different walks of life. As you watch the movie you are consumed with this love affair, although deep down you know it to be wrong, you can not help but fall in love with their love. Whom ever came up with the expression &#34;love is blind&#34; is absolutely correct.<br /><br />Kate Winslet plays an older hard working woman, with the inability to read. She is a proud woman who carries this facade of a perfectly normal woman who does not want to be bothered. Then one day she meets this young boy who is around the age of 15. He is immediately enchanted by her beauty and her strength. Once an accidental meeting, now turns into an everyday reoccurrence between the two. She struggles with her true feelings for the young boy while he is hopelessly in love. He begins reading to her on a regular basis not knowing that she herself cannot read. As time passes by, life alters the course of their lives and they must go their separate ways. Until one day they are brought back together under more trying circumstances.<br /><br />I adore this movie for its true and untainted love between two people. The history of the Jews that is often untold or overlooked. This movie requires uninterrupted attention because you do not want to miss the story as it develops. Fantastic movie....
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love this novel. In Goodreads is listed as one of my favorites.  Is a little dark and twisted with a lot of psychological plot in it but it's so  in deep into the mind,and bu the half of the book you are beginning to hang you mouth open because what come you never saw it coming...
0142419850|5.0|I grew up with Alex Rider. I remember reading Stormbreaker  when I was young and have followed the books ever since, through Point Blank, Skeleton Key, Eagle Strike, Scorpia, Ark Angel, Snakehead, and Crocodile Tears. And finally, the last novel, Scorpia Rising. I've actually had this book in my possession since the day it came out in paperback, but have neglected to read it until just recently. In a way, Alex Rider never truly ended for me for all these years, because I always knew that there was one more book to read, but I couldn't because I couldn't remember the plots of the previous 8 books since it had been several years.<br /><br />So, I finally reread all the previous 8 books, swimming in childhood nostalgia the entire time, and then at last I came to the inevitability that I had to read Scorpia Rising... and that Alex Rider was finally going to end, despite the fact that it technically already ended 2 years ago. But, I read it. And let me tell you, all I can say is...<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />There are so many emotions that got drawn out of me in the final quarter of this book. I've never been so emotionally engrossed in a book in my life, although a part of that is obviously due to my childhood attachments to the series. Even so, this is undoubtedly the darkest and most serious of all the novels. At the end of all the previous books, you notice that Alex is changing due to the mental trauma of the world of espionage. It's making him a colder, more pain filled person. And yet somehow he always manages to shake it off and go back, at least mostly, to his cheery self.<br /><br />But at the end of this book, that is not the case. The ending of this novel is completely bittersweet. There's no way around it. It does end on a generally &#34;happy&#34; note if you think about the long term of it, but at the same there's a feeling of complete emptiness and borderline depression that follows Alex throughout the last three chapters of the book and by the end, itstarts to translate into the reader. And what makes the ending so much darker than the others is that Alex doesn't fully shake out of his funk before the final page is turned and it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Horowitz does give a section, through the mind of a separate character, who basically sums up that Alex will be fine and everything will work out in the end. But the effect isn't quite the same as Alex himself telling us.<br /><br />In a way, this is good though. It gives us a very realistic end to the series. Something like this would cause a great deal of pain in the real world and, assuming it were actually possible for these things to be accomplished by a 15 year old, would leave a person permanently damaged in more ways than one and to therefore end the series on a similar note is appropriate.<br /><br />This novel is amazing, easily one of, if not the, best novel I've ever read. It closed the series very well, on a generally happy note with a painful undertone. I tore through the last 100 pages. Once you get to a certain point in this book, you reach a point of no return and literally have to keep reading until you finish because it's so darn addicting. This is the pinnacle of edge-of-your-seat reading.<br /><br />You MUST read this book. And if you can't because you haven't read the others, then do yourself a favor and read ALL of them. This is one of the best book series in the action/fiction genre ever written.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The person who I bought this for has really enjoyed it.  I Bought season 3 as a companion piece.  Wonderful gift.
030759565X|5.0|This cookbook is great! Wonderful recipes and drool-inducing photos. Most recipes are rather easy and take standard ingredients, so you're more likely to actually make them! I have prepared numerous smitten kitchen recipes and they do not disappoint.

B001S86J2Q|4.0|Bought this as a gift - kind of an 'Us' gift since it's such a classic!  Have not watched this DVD yet.  It has been added to our collection.  The only thing is it's not a 'hard' case on the outside.  It's made of paper so I consider it to be flimsy.  Otherwise, not that big a deal.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Others have provided you the run down of the good and bad of Avatar as a movie and its Plot.<br />this is going to be from the perspective of my wife who had not seen Avatar at the theater or at home on blu ray or DVD.<br /><br />this was watched on an LG 60&#34; Plasma, LG 3D player, at night with a really good surround sound system.<br /><br />She loved the colors and how the 3D was used to bring the viewer into the scenes. she said she could not imagine watching this in blu ray and getting the same experience. She said she felt drawn into the CG scenes but the more &#34;Human&#34; type scenes in 3D just weren't as good. For someone who doesn't like battle scenes she like how this one used 3D to entice the viewer to be drawn across the screen to a variety of perspectives especially the flying scenes. She noticed things I had missed and brought them out.<br /><br />It wasn't necessary to have people wait this long for such a revolutionary film (3D perspective) just to satisfy their hunger for money in my opinion.
B0002DRBX4|5.0|i like this movie,this movie was funny ,i will tell people about it .old movie but good movie nice funny

B005EHILV4|3.0|The mixer works well... XP recognized it right away.  Has a little sonic issue (slushing s sounds...) which may be from the pre-amp...  (Yes I tried it with three different mics).  Anyway... an OK product.  Worth about 39 dollars...
B004LWZW88|4.0|blu ray version<br />Shrek spin off. funny and entertaining.<br />Adult level jokes thoughout. adult kids loved it as much as neighbors.<br /><br />good mix of sound/music and animation. was worth the price as we have watched it multiple times and loaned it to neighbors to watch.<br /><br />is it worth paying more for all 3 copies?<br />yes - I lay the digital on the network and take along movies during my business trips for a bit of entertainment when on the jet or waiting for next flight.  DVD copy is a good loaner for our kids to avoid wrecking blu ray copy.

B002ZG981E|4.0|You think you know what you're watching is real but are you sure.<br />I felt engaged all the way through. a few times I thought I was figuring it all out.<br />but as this started coming to a conclusion... not so much. the end leaves you thinking<br />I like that...<br /><br />when you watch it again you know what's coming but I picked up on things I missed earlier. it helped but I still felt in the end a bit off, not sure if it was real or ....<br /><br />it will be interesting to wait a few years and watch this again and see how it seems.<br />we don't do movie channels, hbo, showtime etc, we pull out our videos and watch them instead.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely adore this game. The kids I babysit fight over who gets to play first, really it is adorable. The horse is very realistic, which carries the virtual title/reputation with it. But it should be MUCH easier to earn gems without having to get apps that you have to pay for; or get to certain levels. I don't know if I'm just not noticing, but now I have tons of games I don't play. Just for the gems. If you did this for fun apps like Temple Run (2), Sims Freeplay, Theme Park, etc., I would give five stars. Thanks for your delicate time!<br /><br />Love, - #birdiebabe<br />; D

B0061QD7YS|5.0|We have owned this in VHS, DVD and now blu ray.<br />My daughter wore out the VHS back in the 80s. so as they aged we got he DVD. Kids are much older but still like Disney for a good viewing.<br />it was time to upgrade to Blu Ray (Disney has us) since now our Grandson is getting of age to start watching.<br />the blu ray was better quality than the VHS and DVD. It reminded me of watching this at the theater as a kid with my parents way back when.<br /><br />we'll continue to upgrade as long as the quality continues to improve on the classics.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|This is a unique piece, which in itself is great, but just a fan of superman Verdader can appreciate to the fullest, in my case, the original Lester was one of the first movies I saw in theaters, and this version is magnificent playing with the same scenes, unique!
B009CGYO0K|3.0|I liked most of it. I found many great insights. I raised two twin ferral cats. You touched on many wonderful commonalities. Thanks. Dave Lewis
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I experience so many emotions throughout the trilogy!  This is undoubtedly the best read I have ever had.  Grey is definitely fifty shades of so many things.  I would recommend to everyone, especially book club, there is just TOO much to discuss with this one.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|We have watched this 3 times now.<br />One with one set of neighbors and then another set after we watched it upon initial purchase.<br /><br />My wife read the books after watching vs I'd already read them to see what all the kids were talking about during classes at church.<br />From my wife's perspective a very entertaining movie with a good back story til the end. She didn't seem to think or feel a sequence made sense. having read the books, the movie left out some key parts and references missed key interactions of being outside the wire hunting why it makes sense during the Games.<br /><br />an entertaining movie, not as good as the book, but few are. we are looking forward to another neighborhood movie night when the sequel(s) come out.<br />digital copy is decent copy and allows me to show others on the plane during travels.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I have enjoyed all three of this author's book.  The plot twists and dark characters make for an interesting read.
B008476HBM|5.0|For being still in high school, I enjoyed this book so much that I should think it a must to read again when I am older. This was by far the best \\"classic\\" I have ever read and may just be one of the best books I have ever read.All books will now be held to a different standard. The characters were completely enthralling. This book is the embodiment of all great reads.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|This was my first Cd from Frank Ocean and I wasn't dissappointed. This young man has a lot of potential. I like metaphors used in rap songs and I love Andre' 3000. Sweet Life is my fav !
B003Y5H57E|3.0|my review is from there perspective as one of those edgy romantic comedies and I must of missed things they got.<br /><br />both liked how  Carell was funny but yet caring. the blunders seemed to be honest and could almost happen to anyone.<br /><br />it wasn't too long or too short (their words). they have lent this thing to all kinds of friends.<br /><br />Even was one of the women and wine night movies.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could not put this book down. I was cautious with it at first, wondering if I would be interested in the life of Hazel- the main character in the story...but I got so overwhelemed with what was going to happen next in this story, I found myself putting off things I needed to do on a daily basis. Warning: be prepared to cry if you are going to read this. It is a great tale of life and love...
B003HV0TN2|4.0|I cannot deny that The Name of the Wind really gripped me, and had me reading hungrily into the late hours of the night. For those of us who read to escape (an not necessarily to experience epiphany with every turning of the page), this is an excellent read. The storyline is compelling and well thought out. It has a natural feel about it. That said, I will elaborate on some negative points that made the story less enjoyable to me.<br /><br />It's important for the protagonist to be likeable (especially when the story is mostly written in 1st-person narrative because the reader feels so much closer to the character). Kvothe is not that likeable. He's arrogant. Yes, he's a genius, and yes, he's had to learn to stand up for himself. Personally, I'm a little over stories that portray the frustration of the child-prodigy with the ignorant hard-headed world outside. I cannot forget that Kvothe is only (for the majority of the story) aged 16. I would have liked to see some more meaningful (emotionally-educational) interactions between Kvothe and an adult character. The adult characters all seem to be kept at a distance when there is really great opportunity for (badly needed) mentorship. However, perhaps that is Rothfuss' intention. I cannot deny that Kvothe's rash (and ill-advised) actions kept me reading (though shaking my head disapprovingly).<br /><br />The interaction at the inn between adult-Kvothe (relating the story of his past) and Chronicler (taking the story down) and Bast provides the narrative with a great opportunity to contrast boy-Kvothe with adult-Kvothe in order to to deepen the reader's understanding of the obviously complicated protagonist. However, this opportunity seems wasted. The interaction between the characters in this setting is consistently shallow and gives these moments a fake feeling.<br /><br />Having elaborated on the negative, I can honestly say that I loved Rothfuss' portrayal of Kvothe's grief in his early years. I found the long process that the character goes through in order to \\"become himself again\\" to be touching and vivid and very convincing. Another great aspect is the nature and the depth Kvothe's emotional relationship with the girl the likes. The reader can really sense this relationship developing as the story progresses; it is multi-faceted, surprisingly mature, and bitter-sweet. It is this relationship that endeared Kvothe to me as more than just an arrogant little kid!<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend it, but be warned about the difficult relationship you as reader are likely to have with the protagonist!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|The biography seemed to drag on and on.  There were way too many grammatical errors to give this work a top rating.
B0072GPQ72|4.0|older family, good surround system and nice size plasma.<br />the music and cinematography were well matched in this movie.<br /><br />The story has a few long drys spells but in the end it had my wife crying (she cries at commercials so that wasn't' much of a surprise). kids like how it jumped from storyline to storyline bringing in a variety of characters who all care about the horse.<br /><br />the movie has been lent to a variety of friends and neighbors (all older kids or empty nesters) who have liked the movie.<br />I think this was worth the purchase since we'll watch it again in the future. especially as grandkids get of age.

B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this story. It was a little tough in places but very complex and intricate keeping your guessing till the very end. Can't wait to read the next one.
B0016492BW|5.0|Classic Classic Classic<br />I got my kids to like this movie from the VHS version (i remember old fireside theater).<br /><br />had to get the Blu ray version as our DVD had died (scratches from too many viewings and kids not putting it up correctly).<br /><br />dang this is still funny. the quality seems a bit better (only a flesh wound).<br /><br />you can't go wrong with this movie. but as my wife says... its more a guys thing (except my daughter likes it).
B0050PYNN0|5.0|Funny as hell!  it is one of those movies that you wanna watch as soon as it is over.  just funny as hell!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Some of his greatest work.  My favorite was Black Velveteen.  Of course, Fly Away and American Women are awesome too.  Simply awesome!!  Thanks Lenny!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I love this series. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and they are hard to put down. Intricate story line really makes you pay attentions.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Good movie (we saw in the theater), blu-ray version shows up very nicely on the LG system.<br />we haven't noticed any real flaws, pixelization or stuttering.<br />The price was so hard to beat  $6, I decided to forgo getting the 3D for now.<br /><br />The boys all got together after Christmas and watched the Capt America before watching the Avengers for a good reference point.<br />The surround sound was solid but not that outstanding considering what you get from the Avengers sound track. but it keep everyone engaged and entertained.<br />I would buy this disc again at that price.
B001PB3RU8|4.0|Mainly bought this for the first track, but found a few others that were good too. Loved the digital copy it came with. Great price and fast shipping!
B00004WPAE|5.0|Great remixes (the only time other than Love and the original Help/Rubber Soul CDs that Beatles multi-tracks have been used for remixes. These are notably different than the versions you know, not just clearer as in the 2009 CD remasters but somewhat different. Certainly not as out there as Love. And the vinyl sounds terrific. This is a great way to get the four Beatles songs found only on this album (Hey Bulldog, All Together Now, Only A Northern Song, It's All Too Much). Much more satisfying listen than the standard soundtrack with the George Martin orchestral side, and since it's all remixed it's not redundant to your standard Beatles catalog.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this series. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and they are hard to put down. Intricate story line really makes you pay attentions.
B004G6009K|4.0|down graded one star - right in the middle of the 3D version it froze (did this on two different players). we had to return it for refund/exchange. this one seems to work fine. (yes we run the blu ray updates weekly to be sure we have the latest).<br /><br />This by far has been one of the best family animated films in years for the whole family.<br />our neighbor daughter loves the princess while her brother likes the horse. who didn't.<br /><br />the sound track matched the images and the 3D while not Avatar was very good. my daughter a bit older) liked the storyline and animation. as an artist she felt engaged by the story, artwork and sound.<br /><br />I just laughed at the dude and how he bungles things and the horse (who's your friend or not) work thu the story to get the girl or did she get him.<br />we need more like this.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|Love the series. Have purchased 1-3.  Hated that Matthew had to be the latest Fellowes victim.  Everything was going so swimmingly with Mary - it just wasn't the right pick!!!  I know the last scene is irrevocable but for heaven sakes, try!!!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|They never get tiring each season. There is always something interesting and attention getting to keep you watching. I have watched all seasons at least 3 times because I don't get bored with any episode. Keep up the great work.
1616550414|5.0|I won't go into detail about why and how I came to buy this book, but I can say that for a Zelda-fan this is a great thing to own. The 5-star rating I gave it, though biased, perfectly explains the feeling I have with it.<br /><br />I would have rather seen it go into a little more detail about previous installments in the franchise besides Skyward Sword, though, but overall it delivers a fine view of the history of The Legend of Zelda. Nicely translated to.
B001HN690O|4.0|wasn't sure it would be near as good as first one.<br />it was funny and engaging. dry in a few spots but man the kids laughed and cheered for Jack Black's panda.<br /><br />it is entertaining in the storyline is reaching towards some real values. an interesting thought for kid movies.<br />is it making a come back?<br /><br />we're hoping for kung fu panda 3 to be as good.
B000JIHP88|1.0|It doesn't work!!!, I change the batteries, and try and try and even try, but it never started to work.
B00000J0O2|5.0|It should be perfect--it is HP toner in the HP printer it was designed for.<br /><br />Order was handled quickly and accurately and the printer will no doubt print for a few more years and may outlive its owner.  Nice people.
B00846F1YW|2.0|You'd think that putting a game like this on a touchscreen would have been adapted to fit the technology, but no, not only are there misspellings everywhere, but the game penalizes the player for attempting to drag around the screen by assuming everything's a random tap and taking time away. You can't even see the top bit of screen without zooming in, so good luck if an object's hiding there!<br /><br />This is worthless. And the story and dialogue suck, too.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|3D version -<br />Didn't see the movie in the theater since I am on the road quite a bit and have a bit of money invested in our home theater over the years.<br /><br />We loved the action and how the movie is starting to integrate all the characters who to this time have been singles.<br /><br />having just watched Avatar 3D only two days before my wife and friends were a bit jaded on how this looked in 3D. They make good use of the 3D but not of the same character or capabilities (shouldn't be a big surprise). But when you watch something designed and filmed like Avatar in 3D you do feel a bit cheated in the 3D effects. Especially during the fight scenes.<br /><br />The sound track matched the graphics and enhanced the interaction between the viewer and 3D movie.<br /><br />we'll continue to grow our 3D library but will be critical. At least this one was not as dark (as in night) viewing in 3D as Thor was.<br />Thor seemed like it was a night movie most of the time. I know part is due to the LG glasses but when you watch Avenger in 3D we didn't pick up on the same dark feeling.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|We use this book in school and its amazing how all of the things that happened in the book you have to read it
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Wish all those stupid advertisements didn't come up on this game.  Very frustrating to try to enjoy the game around all the ads.
1616550414|5.0|loved it brand new always wanted this book since it first came out and now that i have it my zelda collection is complete
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|ben afdick (fuzzy face) thinks that adding hair to his cranium can hide his piss poor acting skills ..  and the oscar goes to .... guess he was right!
B007JMW46U|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes OMG you're gonna love this book you gotta read it, it is an amazing book I tell you the truth
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A great game to play when its too cold to go out and play with real horses. I love it! took a while to calibrate but eventually got around! :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like this challenging game! BUT I wonder if it automatically restarts after the player hits a certain leval
B008476HBM|4.0|Classicly  a period piece, thus slower to read due to the verbiage, but, certainly worth the read! I enjoyed her characters and though the places were not as richly described as I would have liked, it was enough. Several new (actually &#34;olde&#34;) words have been added to my vocabulary!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it! It is so great!It helps you learn to take care of a horse!Exspesisly if you want to learn to take care of a horse!!!!!!
023076651X|5.0|Very insightful and an easy read.  Very encouraging for the budding entrepreneur!  Would recommend this book to anyone looking for a valuable resource in starting their own small business.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I liked the sympathetic portrayal of the residents of the council flats.  The small town politics seemed to ring true.  It was a very ambitious book that followed many characters.  I made a chart to keep track of the characters - who was married to whom with which children.  That's something I don't usually feel the need to do.
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|Difficult to follow the characters as so many of them doing so much. Feel that part of the story lost in confusion. Main story line came through and proved to be a delight at the end. I believe to read the second book is a must, so of I go.......
0375869026|5.0|In today's world kids are picked on at school for being different in the smallest of ways. This book truly captures the essence of what it is to look different and how in the end it's what is inside that truly matters and eventually wins!
B004SBULWE|4.0|I liked the app and it does xactly what it says it will do. No problem downloading fron Amazon appstore.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|This is one of those cases where truth is more interesting than fiction.  I felt he really captured a time and place that I know little about and his description of Mr. Werner was very touching.  People who like this book will also like White Mischief.  It is also a true story that occurred in the early 20th century in Kenya.  It has a similar theme:  a British expat is murdered, a  cover up, many Brits behaving badly.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I  read the whole book thinking I might discover a story. I will not buy any more books by this author.It was a waste of time to read.
0345803493|4.0|I actually enjoyed this title more than the first in the series. I thought it was sexier and that the sexy times were more emotional and compelling. I felt a lot of the naughtiness in the first story was forced, I really felt the connection between Christian and Ana this time. I do think that Christian came off as a lot more immature in this story but I think some of that was explained through visits with his therapist. I also did think the story ran a little long but that overall it was enjoyable. I am excited to see how the story ends, there were a lot of twists laid out that I can't wait to see tied up.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Great web browser I liked the app and it does exactly what it says it will do. No problem downloading fron Amazon appstore.
B005V4FJC4|3.0|I read some of the reviews for this album before trying it out, including several reviewers who who loved it and several who were quite critical. I'd have to say that I found things to agree with from both points of view.<br /><br />First Zooey can definitely sing. She brings an old fashioned relaxed tempo to many of these songs, and where they fit her style, they sound quite good. The problem is that Zooey, while a very nice singer within her range, has a limited vocal range. When she tries to go higher or lower than that range, a few of the notes can get a little flat. Part of the problem seems to be that she is singing completely from the throat, so she doesn't have the wind to bring that full rich quality to her singing, or to sustain notes outside of her comfort zone. She does overcome this from time to time, and she sounds great when she does ... she just needs to work on doing that more often.<br /><br />The complaints about \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" are justified. I've heard dozens of takes on that song ... all of them better than this one. As much as some of the other songs have a relaxed tempo, this one is indeed too rushed ... sort of lilke they're just trying to get through it rather than have the conversation. Here, the performers are just too on top of each other.<br /><br />Many of the songs sound just fine, and the retro feel of both the vocal arrangements and the late 50s/early 60s fashion guitar accompaniment gives this music a sound that you haven't heard in a long time, if ever. I'd urge you to try all the samples, and then if you like it, wait for it to be on sale again. Now that many samples take their selection from the body of a song, and not just the first 15 seconds, you get a better feel from the sample.<br /><br />I did get a kick out of the album art, a classic design straight out of 1961. :-)
0525953728|5.0|Enjoyed the book. Great purchase and service after the purchase. Everyone should read to understand the silent sacrifice of our military personnel!!

B00AF6B22E|5.0|Did not see this movie in theaters, and I like some action movies. so I purchased it to be able to watch it . The cast includes Denzel Washington and he is one of my favorites. So, it must be good!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|what this app.does is tells u the percentage of the battery.On ipads and other tablets it tells u the percentage of the battery but on the kindle fire it just gives u a little graph at the top but not how much battery u have.I completely recommend this app if u have a kindle fire or kindle fireHD.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|A fun little romp.  Sure it has bit of that jr high school humor, but it still matains a high level of charm with some good comedy beats.  Not destined to be a clasic, but a very solid watch once a year, possibly halloween, or even valentines day.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Very good movie plenty of action special effects were great. This movie gave some a  first time glimpse of 007 family and his childhood
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I became entranced with both the family and staff.  The casting was superb.  The daughters all have unique personalities.  Sybil and Mary mirror their mother's beauty and Edith is becoming more endearing as she evolves as a character-- and far prettier.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game so much! Even tho it does not have a point!I would recommend this app !!!!!!! !
1455523550|1.0|One word to describe this book - BORING!!!!!! I was having a hard time trying to finish it..... The main characters are not great or likeable and them falling for each other was totally unreal and depressing. Sooooo unlike author's earlier books like notebook, message in a bottle, dear John, walk to remember.... An absolutely untouching read.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The characters were very deep in this book.  You could relate in some way to each of them.  The story has twists and turns up to the last page.  Well worth the time!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 continues to keep you on the edge of your seat.  You won't believe the ending! Can't wait for Season 4

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Enjoyed this movie, I had seen the first two and was waiting for the release of this one on rental.
0670026603|5.0|This review can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm ([...]).<br /><br />Note: My sincere thanks to Ms Moyes, Penguin Group Viking and NetGalley for providing me with this complimentary ebook copy in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />My Thoughts: I can describe this book in two words: awesome and unputdownable. This is definitely one of those books that will stay with me for a very, very long time.  First of all, I was surprised at how much emotion this book pulled out of me. Yes, even I (the woman who rarely cries) teared up and got more than a little verklempt. This book shocked me, touched me, taught me, and had me sympathize with what quadriplegics deal with on a daily basis.<br /><br />Admittedly, I do not have a lot of experience with quadriplegia so I'm thankful to this book for educating me. Ms Moyes takes the reader inside the daily life of a 'quad' (a term used in the book) -- especially out in the public eye. We're shown, through Will's eyes, how a quadriplegic person feels when people stare or make assumptions and treat 'quads' as 'less than'. They see the wheelchair and the physical disability instead of the person. She also shows the dehumanizing effects on a quadriplegic when others take it upon themselves to decide even the simplest decisions for them.<br /><br />The storyline is wonderful but it's the characters who truly bring this book to life. They are written so honestly and authentically that I found myself wondering about them when I had to put the book down -- which admittedly was as little as possible. These are no cookie cutter/one dimensional characters. You really and truly get to know Lou and Will.<br /><br />Lou begins as a naive and rather dull young woman who has no goals in life. She has settled for what life's dealt her and doesn't desire to better her situation. She's not a pathetic doormat but a character who came off as just not knowing that she could have better. She's a tough girl when pushed and I love how we get to see her come into her own.<br /><br />Will is the antithesis of Lou. He's lived a very full and successful life. He's a very complicated character and although he is brutal with some of his negative comments and could easily be considered an 'arse' (as Louisa describes him) you can't help but find a glimmer of who he really is underneath all the acerbic comments that he uses to protect himself. Together Lou and Will bring out different aspects in each other and that is what sold this book to me.<br />This book deals with a subject matter that isn't often dealt with and does it in an eye-opening, yet truly human way. I found myself putting my Kindle down just to think about what I would do in that situation, whether I was in Will's shoes or Lou's. I'm still not sure how to answer that question. This author doesn't go for the easy shock factor or the sappy tear-fest just to get her readers to shed a tear or two. Her writing is so much more subtle and the relationship between Will and Louisa is more complicated and deeper than I would have expected. The emotion between these two characters slowly builds at a realistic pace and I had to stop myself from skimming through several pages because I was that eager to know what would happen to them. Their love story was sweet and yet very deep. They 'got' each other.<br /><br />Another thing that stood out for me with this book is the way the secondary characters weren't so 'secondary'. They weren't just used as filler and added tremendously to the overall storyline. Lou's boyfriend, her family and even Will's parents have their own burdens and issues which helped to make them much more than a typical supporting cast of characters. Even some of the snarky conversations and sibling rivalry between Lou and her sister were so authentic that I swear I had had similar conversations with my own two sisters growing up.<br /><br />Jojo Moyes has written a brilliant book that is honest, real and so very, very heartfelt. It's a sad read but surprisingly uplifting at the same time. I found myself laughing at Lou and Will's banter but then tearing up and getting the biggest lump in my throat. A roller coaster ride of emotions to be sure!  It's a book about learning to take chances and not letting one day go by without truly living life to its fullest. It's a book about unconditional and unselfish love and never taking anything for granted.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough. I'm giving it my very rare 5 stars. You simply must read this book!<br /><br />My Rating: 5/5 starslaughing at Lou and Will's banter but then tearing up and getting the biggest lump in my throat.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Surprise ending, very colorful settings, wonderful end to a great series in my opinion. I can't wait to see this final chapter of the story come to life in the theaters. If you liked the other 2 books this will not disappoint you. Great ending too.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Well. I read it quickly, but carefully, and it did not leave me satisfied. The author tries to accomplish something a bit different with the back and forth perspectives, and while that was a bit interesting for a while, it became stale. I found the characters mostly not believable. In fact, at the end, I thought all the  primary characters lost their ability to convince me anyone would behave as they did... even the parents and the sister. The secondary characters never lifted off the runway. \\"Amazing\\" Amy would have been much better left to the pages of her fictional world. No spoiler here, but by the time I got to the last few chapters I was laughing... and laughing derisively. Oh, no... I thought, dear Author, .. don't go there. Aw geez.. saw that coming and it's so trite. What is trumpeted as a super twisting novel with surprises that will cause the reader to 'duck!' is really a predictable  bunch of words and an extremely feeble attempt to enter the minds of some messed up people. The author did not do her due dilegence in understanding mental illness or a truly sociopathic mind. I won't bother reading any more from this author. Time not well wasted; money not well spent.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl starts out as a mystery...seemingly perfect couple, married 5 years, beautiful wife disappears.  It's a wild ride from there, and it really keeps you guessing.  It ends up becoming a character study of truly psychotic behavior.<br />The book makes you think about how much importance society places on appearances and how significant public opinion can be.<br />I understand the negative reviews...some people need a hero that they can root for and that is almost impossible to do with these characters.<br />BUT...the writing was exceptional.  It was though provoking and highly entertaining.  Completely warped - in a good way!  I have never read anything quite like this.  FANTASTIC!!!
B000VNMMPM|5.0|I ordered this after watching the movie at a friends.<br /><br />This is an adult love story...Adult meaning intellectual not pornographic...<br />I lonely man...with all the bad qualities a man might possess, yet salvation is near due to his understanding and demonstration of the best of the feminine spirit.<br />No! He is not a woman trapped in a man's body...He hides the compassion and caring we associate with the &#34;softer&#34; sex with sneakiness and foolish bravado we associate with...well, you know who?<br />A wonderful performance by all concerns and an adult tear-jerker near the end...<br />Forget anymore reviews...get it...<br />Hint...Road Home and Isle...different, yet spectacular romance tales...
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is almost perfect.  The only thing lacking is a hand strap.<br /><br />Other than that, this case works well for all situations be it reading portrait, reading landscape on the train commuting to work using the stand feature, watching TV in bed or in the kitchen.  It also puts itself to sleep when the the case is closed due to the nature of the material used.  The ports and the speakers are unencumbered due to the location of the clips and they holds the Kindle very securely once snapped in.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This show was completely enticing.  It was something that you could not wait for the following week to watch, so I needed to get the DVD's to watch over and over again.  You gotta get this show.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I watched this movie about a month before the Oscars, on the recommendation of some acquaintances and people I knew from work. One trend that I tended to notice that all of the fans of this movie tended to be druggies and shall I say, crude, \\"lower-class\\" people with extremely bad taste in entertainment and low IQ's. That not withstanding, I decided to rent the movie. I was indifferent to it, but it was ridiculous. There was little in the way of a narrative. The plot came across as stupid and juvenile. Wow, look, they're smoking pot, wow! Halfway through, the movie just seemed self-indulgent and was going nowhere. I turned off.<br /><br />Then I watched the Oscars last night. Turns out the same guy behind Ted was hosting the show. He was just the most evil, horrible, crude person that I've ever seen in my life. He reminds me of many ignorant Midwesterners and Southerners that I've met in my life. He claims that he was just making jokes, but man, many of them were downright racist and mean. The one about not understanding foreigners? Yup, heard that crap a lot. The John Wilkes Booth joke is also the kind of warped, low-class humor that you will hear many Middle America dullards make. These are the same people that couldn't find Canada on a map.<br /><br />Seth has made my blacklist, along with Judd Apatow. He is a no-talent hack that needs to disappear. If anyone ever tells me that they like his work, that will immediately tell me everything that I need to know about them. Thumbs down to everything this guy has ever made, and will make.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Was looking for a good sci-fi book and came across this on the kindle top sci-fi list.  I must say I really enjoyed it, even with the main character by himself 98% of the book.  I would recommended it to a friend.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I tried to read this book and just keep losing interest and couldnt finish it. not a book for me. The first chapter have so make me want more . So I starting reading e.vampire.com which is sooo much better.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|I'm surprised to see such good reviews for this predictable pile of trash of a horror movie. The only plus, as far as I'm concerned, is that they used some totally unexpected \\"boards of canada\\" songs to flesh out the soundtrack.<br /><br />Nothing about this movie was scary beyond the flashlight scenes. The ending (and build up the ending) was plain stupid. I feel like I've already watched this movie 20 times. It wasn't even as good as my memory of the movies it's ripping off.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke? Sure, I remember him from some random s*** in my youth. But his acting was marginal, his wife clearly wasn't his wife, and oh... did I forget to mention? The plot was s***ty and predictable.<br /><br />The fact that this pile of sheets has so many good reviews on amazon makes me question the entire review system.
0765325950|5.0|I have been following the series for a decade, and was horrified with Jordan died before completing it.  These are characters I grew up with, cherished, and loved.  The final book was extremely emotional for me.  It was exciting because it was a culmination of years of suspense.  It was sad for being the closing of a world that, with the passing of Jordan, will tell no more tales and hold no further adventures.  The lands of the Wheel of Time are silent, and will be forevermore.  Most heartfelt, it was a pantheon of conflicting emotions as Brandon Sanderson expressed the final battle in a visceral realness that was both engaging and terrifying.  Friends were lost, loves broken, alliances shattered, and heroes made.  This is fantasy fiction at its finest.  For fans, it is by no means an easy read.  However easy would not have been satisfying.  As endings are told, this is one of the finest I have ever read.
B0058VW36U|1.0|This game is stupid. I figured when two kids ask for the same game it would be worth 99 cents. Nope. Neither of them played for more than 5 minutes and both said they didn't like it.

B00A3AYI50|5.0|I've never been an Idol fan, but at a friend's recommendation, I purchased Phillip Phillips's debut album knowing little of the recent winner's work outside his breakout hit \\"Home.\\"  The result: I'm enamored.  For one so young and so suddenly stardom-bound, Phillips offers the listener an album bursting with genuine expressions of love, interest in life's little mysteries, rich vocalization, and powerfully crafted melodies.  I applaud his departure from the typical post-Idol artist's masses-pleasing shallowness and pop sound.  The World From This Side of the Moon is, in my opinion, the work of a true winner: a piece of art that I will be enjoying long after the hype has faded.

B004BLDD9Y|5.0|These are the best lights for those places which get used a lot or for long periods of time. They provide good, quality light without the glare/hot-spot and the savings can be seen in the first month of use. while I may need a dim-able version in some areas, I will be moving to this style of light more and more.

B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Turn these pigs over to the butcher for bacon! It is aggravating in trying to figure out the basics of this game. If there are legible instructions, I couldn't find them. Very slow game, and just NOT enjoyable. This PORK needs to be CHOPPED!

B001G7HKZ4|5.0|I love Lee Pace, but this movie is a great story beyond just a good looking man.<br />I love Miss Pettigrew! It is just a great tale of romance and real life and what was happening in London before WWII.<br />That life is all that glamorous as we want.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I liked the way this app was set up, but started noticing that our neck of the woods seemed neglected. When a storm moved in and other sites suggested a 40% chance of precipitation - this app gave us no chance. I started to think that we were being skipped over due to the fact that we are usually pretty dry and are four hours from any major city. I think this app is put together ok, but am disappointed by the way our forecasts were presented, being a rural, relatively arid region. If you are in a big city with interesting weather, you will probably like it, though.

B005IQZB14|5.0|What a joy to read!!  Heart warming to know that sometimes being alone does not mean you are lonely, but gives us the time to find answers. We all have things in our lives that we have yet to understand the why's of and things about ourselves we have yet to discover!!  Highly recommended reading!!
B000001F95|4.0|I love Celtic music, and being a huge Knopfler fan I bought this without auditioning it first.  Good CD with a few very exceptional tracks- beautiful melodies.  Be aware that the stereotypical mid 80s synth and drum sounds run thru most of the tracks.  It would have sounded much better if they'd used a real string section.  I was expecting a more authentic &#34;roots&#34; sound.<br /><br />dg
B008RV5K5E|5.0|For someone who has not been immersed in comics forever, this film gives great reasons why I should.  Vivid animation and classic story line, and terrific voice actors.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|There is a cash shop and I've used it once or twice. This game is pretty fun and graphics look great on my HD 8.9. Doesn't take long to build up resources so I find myself checking this app more often than most others I play.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Love it so far pretty fun. I think everyone would like this game. Everyone would  really really like it so go on and give it a try it's free if you patient enough.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is an awesome game. everyone should play this.very cool game..............I don't care what anyone else said you should listen to me.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Great story, wonderful animation.  Voice actors are the best, especially Peter Weller.  He has been amazing since Buckaroo Bonsai, so you will enjoy getting this DVD.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Having read a number of Jodi Picoult's novels I think this is my least favourite.  Do not let that put you off reading it however as it is still a reasonaly good book just not as good as most of her others.  ALERT - SPOILER WARNING.  I accept that when reading fiction you usually have to suspend absolute factual accuracy but I found the outcome of the court case simply too inaccurate to accept.  At some stage the lawyers involved would have gotten the story and made a plea of involuntary manslaughter and Chris would never have gone scot free.  Jodi Picoult is one of the best when it comes to writing about the effects on a family of certain events and I feel that she really dropped the ball on that in this book.  I would have loved to have read more about the effects on Chris's sister as she was obviously being ignored but the writer simply did not explore this and only made limited reference to her.  The book is an enjoyable read but if you are expecting it to be of Picoult's usual standard then you will be disappointed.
1616550414|5.0|This is a great official Zelda book. It has many things in there that fans don't know about but should. GET IT!!!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I have to say up front that I am a convert. I heard about Tim from a friend who loaned me the 4 Hour Work Week. Some of the material was hokum but some was applicable to the real world. But it got me interested in this guys methods and means. Then the 4 Hour Body came out and I got that. I was pretty well floored by the efficacy of the material. This book is the icing on the cake for sure. I have learned so much from this guy it baffles me why I did not see some of the things for myself. Still, amazing book. Thanks Tim
0739489542|5.0|Absolutely wonderful book. It is very hard to put down. Can't wait to read the next in the series.  Arrived in great condition and on time.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|I am a Jack Reacher book fan.  One must always bear in mind when reading a Jack Reacher book that it is a work of fiction so one can't be too pedantic about reality or factual accuracy (the same could be said about most fiction).  While this is by no means the best of the series I have read it is really enjoyable and entertaining and I would recommend.
B005FWO3QK|5.0|The most ambitious and compelling project of Wagner receives all the credits. A superlative stage, dazzling cast (in which Tomlimsom, Waltraud Meier, Jerusalem, Ann Evans shine), superb orchestral direction shows us the minimum facets of this revealing Op.<br /><br />What I like the most about this production resides in the fact that carves in relief the mythical aspect supported on clever details such as the throwing the fragments the sword in the grave, the remarkable finale, the oath given by Hagen to Alberich, the powerful dialogue between Brunhilde and Waltraute, the memorable role of Evans in the dramatic sequence of the fake, the fabulous special effects and the suggestive visual methapors make of this production one-of-its kind.<br /><br />A collector item.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is one of the best in the series!  Rick Riordan is a great author,  he makes some of the best books ever. I have been reading his books for a long time trust me read the book and the other ones!

B003F3NDOE|5.0|The last season makes it inevitably clear throughout its course that this truly wonderful sitcom is nearing its end, and very dignified so, compared to other shows, which were cancelled much more abruptly and lacking closure.<br /><br />Betty has evolved continuously, and does so by finally addressing her previously-mocked appearance, such as choosing a less-shrill choice of professional wardrobe, a modern pair of frameless glasses, a chic hairstyle, and ultimate braces removal. She is now on-par with much more powerful individuals at MODE Magazine while simultaneously remaining her charming, humble self. The Suarez Family has also matured and developed: Justin experiences his coming out, Hilda stops reeling over Justin's father, Santos', death, and she re-discovers love. After intial hesitation she is marrying her former high school bad-boy crush Bobby, and they plan to move to Manhattan. Father Ignacio admits he will be missing his daughters but knows he will enjoy his new-found peace and space.<br />Meade Empire mother matriarch Claire Meade and career-hungry rival supermodel Wilhelmina Slater make amends. Alpha-male and now-widower Daniel opts to step down as editor-in-chief, conceding the post to once-manipulative Wilhelmina whom he now admits truly earned the position whereas it was only handed to him by his now-deceased father and company tycoon Bradford Meade. Wilhelmina's flambouyant assistant Mark gets promoted to creative director capacity while Amanda finally discovers who her actual father is, while, simultaneously, assuming the opening as a MODE stylist.<br />All interpersonal turbulences are finally laid to rest. But it hurts to see Betty accept an employment offer in London, UK, bidding her good-byes to both family and MODE. Like the other, three seasons this final one is both heartwarming and hilarious, a bitter-sweet finale knowing that another, outstanding sitcom has been laid to rest. At least gently so.

0743454537|4.0|Picoult is a new author to me. \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" was recommended. The writing is precise and engaging with just the right amount of depth for the age of the each character.<br /><br />My only issue is the use of an old bad lawyer's joke about insurance and cigars early in the book. I heard this joke before Picoult was born and was appalled to see it presented as a serious conversation between Brian and Sara. If it was intended to be funny, it was inappropriate in the context of the book. If it was intended to pass for original thinking, it certainly was not that. There was nothing in context to indicate that this was tongue and cheek.<br /><br />I raise this issue because it nearly caused me to skip the rest of the book if that was what I might expect. But in loyalty to my friend, I kept on reading.<br /><br />Picoult is a fine writer, gifted. This joke was beneath her talent.

1616614609|5.0|I'm beyond thrilled at the revival of such a great game (in the wonderful living card game format, to boot!). Having played a ton of customizable games, (especially ccgs and lcgs), I'd say that Richard Garfield's Netrunner is easily the best designed and most skill testing game in the genre -- hands down better designed than the still excellent Magic: The Gathering (Richard Garfield's first take in the genre).<br /><br />One reason the game is so skill-testing is the sheer volume of little decisions one can make. In Magic, one has to draw a card at the beginning of one's turn. In Netrunner, the runner can choose to draw cards, or instead gain credits to pay for stuff, or instead perform actions. This flexibility greatly reduces the variance arising from the random distribution of cards in the deck. Whereas in Magic you can easily not draw lands and die, or in Vs System not draw the right characters and just flat die, in Netrunner you have far more control over the tradeoff between resources. Furthermore, there is an incredible amount of bluffing and mind gaming, so that just as in poker, quite often you're playing the cards and the other player more than the cards are playing you.<br /><br />The game is so skill-testing that you can take any two decks that are in the remote ballpark of equal power level, and a significantly better player will win virtually every game, no matter which side they play. This is not true of a game like Magic, where the higher variance lets weaker players win sometimes (which isn't necessarily bad, of course).<br /><br />The minor changes introduced in the Android version are mostly reasonable. The introduction of factions adds some interesting texture to game play and deck-building. On the whole I like the new art more than the old, though they've unfortunately added some of the female objectification so predominant in fantasy art. The changes in terminology are superficial, though weird in terms of flavor. For example, how can a hackeraccrue roughly the same amount of \\"credits\\" as a huge mega-corporation? It made more sense to me when they were called \\"bits\\". But again, that's flavor that doesn't affect game mechanics, so for many people the terminology is unimportant. The only change I really don't like (or perhaps just haven't got used to) is the reworking of the trace mechanic, insofar as the blind-bidding of old added some interesting strategy. Furthermore, the fact that trace and link can be arbitrarily increased seems (at least in the games I've played) to reduce the game-impact of resources and hardware that increase the runner's link. In the context of the current rules, why would you even play a card that does nothing but give you +1 link? It seems so weak that it it's not worth a card. Though perhaps I just haven't adjusted my thinking to the new mechanic properly. These are minor changes though -- the game is largely identical to the older version.<br /><br />If you like very skill-testing strategy games with a touch of variance and a lot of mind-games, incomplete information, and bluffing, then there's a good chance you'll love this game.

B005PK1G76|5.0|This organizer is inexpensive and wonderful. my little boy is almost 3 and I needed something that I'd be able to fold up easily with my city mini. I didnt want to have to take the organizer off every time I folded the stroller, how annoying that would be! This doesnt get crushed when stroller folds, but you have to take your stuff out of the organizer before folding or it will likely fall out after folding (keys, gloves etc.) i also like how it's made out of wiring, which makes it flexible if you have a larger or smaller cup and don't want it to move around while you're strolling. the organizer is also not bulky like the baby jogger one looks. it's a very simple design and allows you to just throw things in and take them out at ease, such as keys, hats, gloves, phone, drinks, etc. convenient. worth it. however, it doesn't have all the coverage like zippers and velcrow, but I dont need all that anyway. there is one zipper pocket that ive never used but  its also a plus.

1439107955|5.0|Dr. Mukherjee penned a magnificent history of our awareness and treatment of cancer. His accounting of how science and medicine has evolved in their attempts to address this horrible disease is written in an easy, engaging prose that is suitable for laypeople and scientists alike, no simple accomplishment.

B000G03RJA|5.0|I chose this CD primarily because of the artist. Laura Branigan is absolutely the best. I would strongly recommend this awesome collection of her music! There will never be another like her.She is greatly missed, but we can still cherish her music.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I deleted this app.  After I downloaded it and opened it I saw that this was just not my kind of game.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Very cute and addictive game!  The free version only works for a limited number of levels.  Then you have to pay to continue.  Totally worth the 5 bucks though.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I know this is one of their early CDs but I wanted to hear it and was not disappointed. It is good singing and music in a very different type of rock music.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is such a fun game!!! I really enjoy it and its an added bonus that it comes for free. I have it on a kindle fire and it doesn't glitches at all!!!
B003YL4LYI|1.0|When I. spend the time and energy to read a series of 5 books I expect an ending. I turn pages in a book to find out  what happens next. It's like the author was undecided on an ending so just quit writing.

B005LAIHSG|5.0|I loved the new take on an old fairy-tale and the special effects were great. I am excited to have this DVD in my collection.
1612680011|4.0|I liked this book, it's an easy read and offers a very different perspective from anything I've ever been told before. I didn't take the advice that he gives, because it is pretty radical and I'm not quite bold enough. But I take what he said into consideration and I like any book that gives me a new perspective.

Buy it!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Writer(s) took a great idea about a highly skilled pilot being a savior but then turned it into a pathetic story about the misery of being an alcoholic.  After the first 20 minutes...you've seen the best of this movie.  Just watch the trailer and save yourself the rental fee.<br /><br />Great acting, as always from Denzel but he chose a bad script this time.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Simply AMAZING! The ending had me in tears. Really good book. I could reread this book over and over again... it's that good.
0156029065|5.0|I see that many people have stopped part way through or are dissappointed with the ending. I feel that this book deserved 5 stars for doing what it does in a manner hardly if recently surpassed: transporting the reader into a mode of thinking, rather than simple historical events, within the chosen time-frame.  The number of regions mentioned, languages brought into context, and modes of authority (military, religion, law, sailors...), contribute a lushness to a world and time otherwise depicted in a very brutal way despite other glimmers of light.  Even if this isn't read all the way through, simply giving a good try at getting into it will likely prove a rewarding experience to those who are willing to pause and consider what they are reading. This being said, if history is what you are after, I would recommend \\"A Distant Mirror\\" as an in depth piece, though the time frame is somewhat different, or a more standard survey of history otherwise.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I guess that if there was anything that I would change in the film it would be to have a great looking chick as the bond gal, but very exciting indeed.  And if your wondering about ordering ahead of time this worked out super for me as the price actually dropped and Amazon shared that with me as advertised.<br />The film is a little long but again very entertaining for sure.
B005HWUBZ0|4.0|I'm a fan of MH, and this album does not disappoint.  While I wish I could hear something totally different from him, his style and creativity are very evident in this CD.  So, no complaints!
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|The best actor in Argo  was Al Arkin.<br />I much preferred Zero Dark THirty, because the actors, like Jessica Chastain,  were better than any of  the actors in Argo, except for Al Arkin.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|like a book too good to put down, I couldn't stop playing til I had beat all the levels perfectly, great game
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This series is truly to go down as one if not the best.  Twists and turns, surprises, deaths, once thought dead alive what more could anyone ask for.
034580404X|4.0|These 3 books are really, really good.  Very erotic and shows a completely new world of erotica that I was not aware of.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I chose to see this again because I liked the recent film, Hitchcock. Because of the film, Hitchcock, I was able at last to realize why PSYCHO is his best film.
B0050VI5SI|5.0|I absolutely love this album. I've drifted out of modern music because when I turn on the radio, it's usually garbage. FTP seems to have something special going on. Each song is unique and that's unheard of these days. Looking forward to more music in the future. :)
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I was pretty sure I'd buy this album after I heard &#34;Closer&#34; on Youtube. This was confirmed by the second prerelease single from the album.  I'd never come across Tegan and Sara before, and after &#34;Closer&#34;, I sampled some of their previous work and found the sound on their &#34;indie&#34; albums a bit thin for my taste.<br /><br />But Heartthrob has compelling songs (all of them), with a good solid sound, wonderful lyrics, and, of course T & S's delicate vocals tying everything together.  I've been listening to it pretty continuously for the past month.  I'm a convert.
B000UZ4G8M|1.0|I gave this a low rating only because when I order it, I thought I was ordering the first three seasons DVD's not CD's. So the CD's might be great but it was the series that I wanted.  I don't like to return things so I just kept them although I will probably never listen to them.
B002RSQGQK|4.0|Nice to see this old film again.<br />I preferred Grace Kelley when she  was still allowed to be sinister and not yet a princess.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I originally got this app everal month ago for my smart phone. It is fantastic for that appliction.  Easy to navigate through and much easier to read than using the phone internet browser.  However when using my 10&#34; tablet I prefer using the internet.  It is a bit cumbersome to navigate through unlike the website where everything can be done through one page!<br /><br />Overall a good app.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Great moive...funny. interesting..<br /> I had a good laugh... each characters are done well.<br />A must see movie.. Worth every penny.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|It had a few slow spots but the story was good. Was suspenseful, good effects and entertaining. Kids did great acting. Glad we checked it out instead of passing it by.
B004WMKSH2|2.0|Tedious, boring, I didn't finish watching this movie.  I don't like the books either.It's not as good as Tolkein (The Hobbit).<br />I sm 75 years old.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Best match 3 game, fast paced, fun, requires skill and it's free! Thank You Amazon! Many levels, your choice of play mode, I love this game!
B0059R5Q08|4.0|we thought it would start when she was a little girl growing up. we love the clothes they wore in that time
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I went into watching this updated version of Footloose without trying to compare it to the original. Yes they did change many aspects in this one but I wasn't looking for a replacement for the older version. I thought it was entertaining and music from the 80's is always a plus! The dancing was good and enjoyable.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|This film was funnier and more instructive than any of the other films I just rated (see below)<br />So there.
1440503257|5.0|This book is really cute and cleverly done. I love the page edges, they look old and ragged like, very authentic looking. For the most part this book will most likely go into the &#34;Potter Collection&#34;, of the gift recipient, but quite a few of the recipes sounded really good
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|one of the best movies I have seen . I guess because we lived there. the young girl did a great job
B004G8P142|2.0|Why it was banned anywhere is beyond me.  I could not finish reading it and probably wont.  Enough said already.
B004G6009K|5.0|I love this movie. It is funny, warm and engaging. The production could easily be staged on Broadway. The music is just that great, in my humble opinion. 3D enhances the movie and does not distract. I would recommend it as a starter movie when you first buy your 3D set. It is fun for all ages. When I saw it in the theater, a baby about two laughed her little head off at various scenes. Adults laughed at different scenes, but everyone found something wonderful about it. You will not regret buying it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|.. sometimes multiple times.  I like that I can have multiple saved alarms that have different ring tones, and I even enjoy the silly tunes that can be used as ring tones.  Nothing revolutionary, but functional.
B008476HBM|5.0|A true classic. An all-time favorite. I recommend this read to everyone! I love that Amazon offers free Austen e-books.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|How could you NOT love this? Absolutely wonderful!! The characters are like friends and the scenery is just lovely! Would recommend it to everyone!!
B009FB3XTA|4.0|One of the better twilight soundtracks. Less instrumental and much more vocal performances. A must to add to your twilight collection
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Simple and clean, and it works perfectly for what I need. I like the option of two different calculators, depending on the difrection of my kindle.  And free.  Very nice.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Safe Haven was highly disappointing. Alex and Katie meet at the grocery store but Katie tries to keep to herself. They fall in love awfully fast. So fast, that it wasn't believable. Sparks gives us an insight into Kevin, the abusive husband. Kevin's thoughts are so childlike its almost just distracting to read. The ending of the book is the worst part. It made me feel as  if the first 300 pages were just a waste  of time. I don't suggest wasting your time either. Not a good read.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|As soon as this knife showed up in the mail I started abusing it. Great for camping or for general mayhem. The thick blade works great to split wood and the extra weight makes it handy when hacking up branches into kindling. Would recommend this to someone who wanted a camping knife.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is perfect for waiting room at the doctor's office. After the first few stsges it starts to get challenging and fun.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The pictures and videos are not as good as on my (dumb, as in non-smart) camera phone, but they are on a bigger screen so that could be useful.  I'll keep it, but I'm not impressed.
B009IF8CH6|2.0|The TV show is perfect but I think that Amazon should provide the different subtitles available on a regular DVD.
B00001U0E1|1.0|Not impressed.  Bought this as a gift for someone and they lent it back to me to watch.  Wasted my time and money, but the person who I gave it to was ok with it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Didn't think I would like it, but wanted to see what the hype was all about. Now I am hooked:)
B005KH928E|5.0|Is it Traditional New Orleans Jazz?  Is it Chicago Blues?  Both I guess.... and I want more of it!!!!  Two genres of music that are very distinct, but also intertwined in each other's DNA introduced together in a way I've never heard.  If there is more of this out there, please let me know!  Nothing bad could ever happen when two masters like this get together!
B000062TU1|5.0|Excellent movie and a enjoy the whole series of the movies.  When nothing else is on or better to watch, we just watch this.  Classic.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This fast-paced and suspenseful novel just got better and better as it progressed.  Grisham's  ability to embellish a storyline has always been unparalleled.  In the Racketeer, he out did himself!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The book itself is a really good read.  It's both entertaining and makes you think.  If you're at a crossroads in life and are looking to make decisions, you should give this a try!
1607066017|4.0|SAGA has been generating a bit of buzz since it came out, and rightly so in my opinion. Brian K. Vaughan's and Fiona Staples's work is a bizarre, beautiful, magical space opera that may turn off some readers for being too strange. But those who are willing to jump in despite that strangeness will be rewarded.<br /><br />SAGA is the story of Alana and Marko, lovers from two sides of an intergalactic war who have deserted and sworn off violence. They are looking for a place of refuge, not only for themselves, but for their newborn daughter as well. That search is going to be tricky with two armies and a couple freelance bounty hunters hot on their trail.<br /><br />On one side of the war is Landfall, the largest planet in the galaxy, and home to winged creatures, high tech weapons, and robot royalty. On the other side is Wreath, Landfall's moon, home to horned creatures who wield a mighty magic. As the destruction of a planet or its moon would have disastrous consequences for the other body, the two sides have taken their war to other planets in the galaxy, killing, destroying, and laying waste as they go. Think of it as a more violent, cosmic form of colonization and imperial warfare. Operating on the fringes are bounty hunters, called \\"Freelancers,\\" monsters who live by a code far different from the Moonies and the Landfallians.<br /><br />And don't forget the rest of this very colorful cast of characters, from a lie-detecting cat, to a planet-sized brothel, to a planet protected by ghosts, and a rocket ship forest. Here's where artist Fiona Staples really shines. If Vaughan had written this story as a novel, it would have seemed a little bent, but Staples's imaginative, out of this world artwork really warps your mind.<br /><br />This is a summer action popcorn movie in comic book form. But it's not all laser rifles, magic swords, and spaceships. There is a heart and substance here that grounds the story in a very genuine place. I felt for Alana and Marko. Their love is real, even when they fight. And you want them to find a safe haven away from the death and destruction. But man is it a weird trip. It's not for everyone, but if you are looking for something different, start with SAGA.ve is real, even when they fight. And you want them to find a safe haven away from the death and destruction. But man is it a weird trip. It's not for everyone, but if you are looking for something different, start with SAGA.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game recommend to every one to get this product unlimited action from running away from cops to dodgeing trains and collecting power ups
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This series just continued to get better and better.  We are anxiously awaiting the release of season five, even knowing that it is the final season.  Had to be one of the best series on television.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was OK.  You could see where it was headed from the first few chapters.  Very, very predictable book.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This series has me completely mesmerized.  Bryan Cranston is a remarkable actor.  I wish the series had not ended.  The storyline is one that is really spellbinding also.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was good from beginning to the end. I literally just sat here for two or three hours, I lost count, and couldn't put it down. It brought memories back from when my mom use to have these books stacked up to read.
B00319ECC4|5.0|This is my first Fear Factory album that I have purchased since Raymond left the band, there is definitely a noticeable difference but still good. I enjoyed the album.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Ever since Palm Pilot Xand PPC this game has held my attention. This is a very good version, not perfect, but very very good
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|There is nothing that can be said about this album that everyone does not already know. My CD was scratched up and I decided to buy the digital version and I love it. No matter how bad a day can get, Bob Marley can always make it better.
B007L96VCY|4.0|Perfect product, it`s beyond my expectations. I highly recommend it for everybody, you are going to love it, no problems to report.

0765325950|5.0|I had my apprehensions about someone other than Robert Jordan finishing the series but what Brandon Sanderson did to finish this was pure magic. I've now started reading more of his stuff because he ended my favorite series so well! There is amazing twists on every page making it difficult to put down always finding time to read one more page.
0385344333|5.0|Jack solves a terrorist plot and rescues undercover agents because he was thought to be involved with a crime of killing because of his  association with the people in the get-a-way car he hitched a ride.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Bought as a birthday present for my grandson and he loves it.  Like Pictionary except that you build things instead of draw them.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book left me longing to go and find myself.  To hike alone and reflect on my own life.  Brilliant words fill these pages.
B007WDPPK8|4.0|I wish I would have purchased a book instead of the kindle version. It's just not fun for me to read things off a screen.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace is a wonderful movie about the destruction of the British slave trade.  Based on the true story this 2006 film was strongly recommended to me when it came out.  I was busy at the time and only got around to seeing it recently.  I wish I had seen it sooner.<br /><br />The movie shows us how William Wilberforce struggled for years to stop British ships from trafficking in slaves.  He was opposed by those who made money from the trade.  William was a young politician who experiences a religious conversion.  At first he considered giving up politics but decides to try to get rid of the slave trade.  He started in 1782 and was unsuccessful for years.  He is supported by a few others devoted to the cause, but for a long time they are unable to convince a majority of the Parliament to stop the trade.  Finally they are successful.<br /><br />I strongly recommend the movie.  If you have not seen it, track down the DVD now.  It is well worth watching.  It is uplifting to see how a few determined men can accomplish great things.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Heyy im julia i love this app just got it looking to talk to guys im classy not trashy but alittle nasty love sports and im a christian hot guys only plzz(; if u think im cute hit me up men 15-18 only thanxs kik me at!jpatmos6
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This was such a funny movie! Loved it from start to finish and the music was absolutely spectacular. I definitely recommend it to everyone.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Does rating it actually get you a sequel... I'm about to find out. So far this game is uber fun, but I played full version of a different G5 game and do not want to pay for another when it only gives a few hours entertainment.
B0054S6N04|4.0|Special thanks to my reader friends here on Amazon for this one. Loved it! Neighbors Sam and Jaine, both new to the neighborhood, don't start off on the best foot. However, their antagonism turns to sexy heat fairly quickly. Good romance with a villain who's off the deep end and creates the mystery/suspense element that surrounds a \\"List\\" of perfect male qualities 4 friends make up one night over drinks. It's witty, funny, sexy, suspenseful and entertaining. Just an all around great time. The H/Sam is wonderfully alpha and Jaine the h is one of the better ones I've read. This girl is no pushover; she's snarky, funny, and take's no one's crap.  She's also a true smartass. A quality I highly appreciate in my Heroes and/or Heroines.<br /><br />As my friends did for me, I gladly pass along my recommendation for this one.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|i didnt take too well to this movie although my boyfriend says he would recommend it to men who like good movies.
B008CX2A2I|5.0|Couldn't be happier.  It's great to hear the music I have on My computer go to my Ansroid phone and then to my home audio system
B0071MDA2U|5.0|This was such a great book, but what an ending! Definitely a cliff hanger! I couldnt put it down. Can't wait for book 3.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|works great on my Galaxy Nexus but will never get passed the Imagni screen on my Kindle Fire. Incredibly unhappy and uninstalled.
B009XTF8KQ|5.0|i loved the movie bc i love scary movies and they ready set this one off and the way you send it was great thanks it was like new
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is a great adaptation of the Avengers. They finally got the Hulk down, and the chemistry is pretty good throughout. Not to big a fan of Thor but it works. Lots of action and humor to keep you entertained and involved. Looking forward to the next installments of this series and hope that the studios don't ruin this!
B004ISVH7U|5.0|..hearing this on the radio back in the day always felt comforting, like nestled safely in the arms of someone who truly cared. I'm glad to be reminded of that memory in these transitional times
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|How can you go wrong with this great work of art...and free is a great price as well.  My grandkids love it
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I have never played one of these games all of the way through until this. It was fun. I like the fact that it isn't just a hidden object game but one that involves strategy. Remember the the full game Is not free. It lets you get sucked in then asks you to buy the remainder. This is the only reason I give 4  stars instead of 5. I find this to be a dirty trick. What isn't that way these days? There's no such thing as a free lunch!!!
B003O85W3A|4.0|This album by Arcade Fire , it has a conbination of new wave, post- ponk, and some alternative sound. The concept from this album is more likely about &#34;Suburs&#34; - folks who went into a unknow creativity, but without loosing the trades of the band. The songs are great but their a kind of long.. it seems that they didn't want to finalize its adventure (theorically) . End up, well and it is a good thing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is better then temple run and temple run two.it is rally easy to play and you never get board
B00008YJH5|3.0|This album it has as a big issue on the quality of the sound; however, the songs are very intresting in the fact of beign punk. One of the things that I brought in mind of this album is that their's no concept of the album . Even that the album is named Surfer Rosa , I didn't get that expecificarion. All sond are alright and keep rocking
B0038QMREK|4.0|I'm still partial to Shallow Graves, but I really like this album. My only complaint is that they didn't cut the hole big enough for me to put on the spindle so I had to fix that. I intend to buy his most recent album as well. DEFINITELY The Tallest Man on Earth still. Nothing's changed there!
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Don' r know what the hype is all about! Liked the story but found it hard to stay awake. A goog expose and reenactment of the hostage crisis but not an academy award winner. It sad the awards shows are more about political statements vs good productions like Lincoln.
B000UZ4OYS|5.0|I highly recommend this album if you like new folk, or what I call &#34;indie folk&#34; like The Tallest Man on Earth, William Fitzsimmons, Mumford and Sons or Damien Rice. I will definitely listen to it over and over again.
0545265355|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it for all ages. Read the final book in only three sittings, However, it's geared more towards the teens.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I was skeptical about mobas on mobile, but this game is just plain awesome. Great graphics, lots of choices, and it's free. Great job, again, Gameloft!
0316044695|5.0|This was a great book! The author did a great job telling his story and keeping the reader interested! May we never forget those brave warriors who gave their life for our freedoms!
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I love both the presentation and content of this book and I wish I'd read it long ago.  Great personal stories bring Home the Strategies for keeping an optimistic outlook and perform week even under what seem to be horrible circumstances.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is so cool!!!  the first time I tried it, I was so amazed it has perfect graphics and much, much more!!!!!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I like the concept here.  Execution is &#34;demo&#34; rough (no polish on the images, no 3-D looks, no flare).  Needs to be able to spin on both axis.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is THE best show out right now and it is good to be able to watch it at my own pace.

0061692034|2.0|One of the words you hear a lot in glowing reviews of this novel is \\"spare.\\"  Well, sometimes spare is just plain boring.  Sometimes spare can be powerful - several novels by Cormac McCarthy and Ron Hansen come to mind.  And I loved Independence Day, a not-spare novel by Richard Ford.  Here, I think the hype is not justified.  Spare is just plain boring.  Very little happens.  There is little detail surrounding even the most momentous plot points.  Characters are thin, and so you don't care much about them.  Spare, by itself, is just too...well, spare.
1878424750|5.0|Received earlier than expected and in excellent condition.  I already had the book and now I listen to the CD every night before I sleep and it soothes me and calms me down.  I have always had trouble falling asleep but not any more.
1416562605|4.0|From his office in Electronics City, the technology neighborhood in Bangalore, India, the prosperous businessman Ashok Sharma, owner of a flotilla that transports executives and employees between their work centers and homes, spends his nights writing letters to Wen Jiabao, China's Prime Minister, looking forward to his near visit to India. The purpose of Ashok, better known as \\"the White Tiger\\", is to explain his country, taking his own life as example. But Ashok Sharma is not his real name, that being Munna (which means only \\"child\\"). His father was Vikram Halwai, a humble rickshaw driver, or rather, puller. They used to live in a hut in which the White Tiger calls \\"the Darkness\\", or the Ganges river basin. He is motherless, and is \\"taken care of\\" by his grandmother, uncles and siblings. In school, the teacher thinks his name Munna is preposterous and calls him Balram, but a government inspector, discovering he is brilliant, calls him \\"the White Tiger\\", something like \\"the Chosen\\". The area where he lives is dominated by four fierce and corrupt landlords, and soon Balram emigrates to another city, where he learns to drive. He becomes a taxi driver and eventually ends up as private chauffeur of one of the landlords' son, the real Ashok Sharma, a young, Westernized man married to a frivolous, capricious and hot woman called Pinky. He goes with them to Delhi, where they live in a luxury apartments complex while he sleeps in a moist, fetid hole full of cockroaches. Balram becomes a witness to the corruption of the Sharmas and the public officers they bribe; of the despotic behavior of the rich towards their servants; of the rising inequality; of the frivolity and careless spending of the nouveaux riches; and of the cynicism of other drivers and servants. He is clever and gradually becomes a cynical as the rest, until something happens that brings about the climax of his story.<br /><br />This crude and merciless fable dissects a rotten society, torn apart by corruption, excess, vulgarity, social climbing, and dirtiness. The narrative technique works very well, by keeping the narrator's fundamental naivete, seasoned in absolute cynicism and insensibility, a \\"sentimental education\\" that has taught him that all that matters is power and money. Horribly close and vivid, his description gets imbedded in the reader's consciousness and pops up every time one goes out on the streets or reads the news, by understanding that this is the real face of society. Pervaded by a black humor, depressing, and raw, it may not be great literature, but it sure is a demolishing literary monument.
1851775722|5.0|I do historic interpretations at a couple of historic homes in my area, and I'm asked questions about what I'm wearing.  This book helped to fill in more details for a better presentation.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculated and so much better than trying to use the one on my phone. I like not having to try to keep track of a calculated too. When I pay my bills all I have to do is go to this app on my Kindle fire that I always have handy anyway. It has all the operations I need and big friendly keys too.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|This is an amazing true sorry, a must see!  I bought this on my kindle fire and there are bonus features after the final credits.  I highly recommend this movie!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Graphics are smooth and the horse's actions are realistic enough. The gems could be easier to earn, but it isn't too bad and the game overall is fun.
B005FISBTO|5.0|This season was probably my least favorite.  Which is not to say that it's not worth watching.  Just not quite up to par for Dexter.  The cliffhanger ending is what made me add it to my collection.
B00003CXA2|3.0|I like Tom Hanks, but I do not really like some of the R things in the movie.  It was fun watching him projected into the past historical pictures.
0345803485|5.0|A real page-turner!  I could not put this book down!  Full of sex, so not for the younguns, and quite dark, but that's what makes it so very interesting.  I purchased all three together and I'm so glad that I did.  The end of the first book leaves you hanging, so for that very reason, you may want to purchase all three together, too.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Matt Damon is always great in roles of adventure.  I think the lead actress might have been better with someone else in the role, though.  My son recommended this movie, knowing that I like Romantic comedies, suspense.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Breaking Bad is such a well-written, well-acted show.  Season three is just as good as 1 & 2.  Well worth the money.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Roberty Downey Jr is always a delight.  He and Jude Law make a great pair.  Fun story, and worth keeping on my shelf.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|When Andy Whitfield got sick and couldn't film the second season of Spartacus, I was devastated.  This show filled the gap for me.  It has many of the original characters from the first season and some new very nicely chiseled (Gannicus) characters to provided extra eye-candy.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is an awesome game,especially for being free.Its really fun & makes you think-which I really like for my kids.This app is worth getting.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|My kids watch this show over and over.  It's funny, sad and sends a pretty good message.  Also, the soundtrack is classic rock at it's best.
B006HL9G10|4.0|The programable feature and the choices for the sounds of<br />bells are very easy to use, and make it fun to meditate.<br /><br />Not sure I like the idea of counting minutes, this seems like<br />an American thing, maybe getting enough minutes to go the<br />Green Stamp store and trade it in for a bottle of enlightenment.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Once you start watching this series you will want to order or borrow the rest of them because it's so addictive.  I was on line ordering the remaining seasons after watching episode 4 of the first season.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is an awesome CD, my wife loves him and it was part of our anniversary weekend and he really helped.
0395389496|5.0|This story is so great at Christmas.  Every family should have this book.  The hard cover edition is very good quality.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The problems and issues that Charlie goes through are so real and relatable. You start to feel for him and by the end of the book it's like you've gone through all the good and the  bad with him. Chbosky's writing style makes the whole of the novel raw. All in all it's a perfect coming of age work that you'll remember forever.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|You can't skip any season of this series, it is just phenomenal.  No wonder these actors win all the awards.  So much entertainment.
B003XYERRM|5.0|This engaging novel completely changed my perspective on Richard III.  I found Sharon Kay Penman's portrayal to be sympathetic and thoroughly believable.
1451695195|4.0|I really like the book.  I always enjoying reading from a scientist perspective.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I thought it was a bit redundant; saying the same thing over and over.  I didn't see him interviewed so I was a bit in the dark about what he went through.  I found the book uplifting and interesting since we don't really know what happens on the other side!
B005YDLJ76|5.0|I enjoy all of Beyonce movies, music, and so on...I was glad to find her live performance at Roseland on DVD, I absolutely love the Elements of 4 and the home video clips that &#34;B&#34; added in from her childhood years and other leisure. This was a great addition to my Beyonce collection, I am looking forward to more :) from 1 Beyonce fan to another.
0743201140|5.0|I decided to read this book after reading the initial book &#34;First Break All the Rules&#34;.  I would recommend both books.  They take a very eye opening approach to managerial skills and behaviours.  I have attempted to put numerous concepts in place at my employment and take a totally different mindset to what I expect from my managers.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Slow start.  Corey's sarcasm gets old after page 20 (and is barely endurable for the next 600+ pages).  The last 100 pages make it all worth while, with a satisfying end.  God bless Predator pilots.
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved the sexy details. This book was more \\"normal, down to earth\\" then Fifty Shades, but both still great reads. Aluczyk79@gmail
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Incredible creation! Blake Crouch will give you what you want from a book every time. I highly recommend this book. I developed a high respect for the main character Ethan Burke, he is such a survivor. Blake developed him so very well that I truly cared what happened to him and felt worry for him towards the end I had no idea what would happen. An author that develops his characters so well and thinks through and researches his stories so much always gives you a good read. You can't judge Blake Crouch stories by the price of his books, he is brilliant, creative, scientific, and incredibly thorough. He won't leave a story lacking ever no matter how inexpensive his books are. Try a couple of his books I've no doubt you will love them and want another and another. I love this author, give us more Blake your great!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Made my head twirl and my toes curl! I can't wait to read the 3rd addition. Please hurry it up.
B005IQZB14|4.0|good book as it is true for those who don`t have a clue about  wilderness hiking...<br /><br />brought me back to the beauty & peacefullness of the mountains and beauty of the CPT.<br /><br />Similiiarexperience of most of those who are bogged down with sadness and loss to write about it...as catharsis.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I can´t see why there is so many one star review. I like that you can leave it then come back to it and finish it where you left off.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book will keep you on the edge of your seat.  You will love every single page that you read.
0060594896|5.0|If you're serious about wanting to make changes in any area in your life, well here's the road map. I go back and reread it all the time, especially when I feel stuck or uninspired or if I have new goals.
B007EW9ISM|3.0|I had so much hope for this stylus after all the glowing, positive reviews from so many people but it was not to be.<br />Like others I have tried, this too needs some effort to tap buttons on screen and write. It doesn't need a tremendous amount of pressure but its more than it really should be for comfortable writing.<br /><br />Other than that though, I actually like this stylus. I like the size, weight and feel of it in my hand but I'll definitely continue the search for my ideal stylus. I think Wacom Bamboo may be next :-)
B003N7ORNI|5.0|I like it very much it is very super thank you very much for such a nice book and I look forward to more books in the same series
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this book so much. Funny yet serious. I laughed and cried!!! This is the way a book is supposed to be!! Bravo
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|Easily the first and one of the very best Megadeth classics. A pioneer to the genre, this album is a powerful statement that stands the test of time.<br /><br />The 2004 remaster of this album was not as bad as people claim, but it did absolutely no justice to the original recording, hence the hatred. Apparently Dave was well aware of this, and this remaster definitely took account of the critics. Sound is crisp and clear. Lows are powerful, but definitely not overwhelming whatsover. Obviouse standouts like Devil's Island, Bad Omen, My Last Words and the title track outstand as did their original counterparts.<br /><br />Not only a must have for any Megadeth fan, but any fan of the genre as well. This is a thrash landmark that set the bar for speed and accuracy.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Game is fun and addicting. I love to play this game on my breaks at work. This one of my favorite game.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book.  I could not wait to read it and then to see the movie.  I also read the other 2 books in this series and thoroughly recommend them to everyone!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A real-life fairy tale so grandiose in its presentation that it boggles the mind that such a thing can exist in this world and especially in our country. A country where the legacies of minorities and poor people are frequently discarded as trash talk, then secretly sold to the lowest bidder. Who then quietly creates a small fortune for themselves and their families all the while the real hero's family continues on, usually in poverty, but always in obscurity. This Documentary reveals what if...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow, do I need to even comment on this!  It was just as good and entertaining as the first book.  Highly recommend it!
B005P9SLES|3.0|I have the dvd which is a better quality than this blu-ray, picture is not as sharp as blu-ray should be.  Also, the sound is bad.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Turned out great!  I have to say when my son first got this book to read as an English reading project I was very skeptical.  I also read the book enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it to parents whose children will have to read it for school.  It was very good!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|He writes well.  Digs deeply into woman's character - how does he do it?  Some slow spots but last 20-30 pages - great.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow!  This is a great workout!  I believe doing this dvd every day helps get me ready for the day and for the next work out.  I'm 48 so I started sort of with low impact, I try to throw in high impact as much as possible.  I have to keep in mind, don't push it to the point of hurting yourself because then you won't be able to do it again for awhile.  The first 10 days of Level 1, I felt so great.  By the 4th day, I was doing high impact.  By the 7th day I could feel my strength building on the workouts.  Now I'm 6 days in to Level 2 and I feel so much stronger.  I know I'll finish this and then I'll start over.  When I start over, I'll make the workouts more high impact, I'll push myself harder.  I'll go lower on the push ups, I'll reach higher on the sit ups, etc.  I'm sore, not a painful sore, a worked sore.  I feel great.  I have more energy.  I'm too tired to snack - lol!<br /><br />My husband says he definitely sees definition in my sides.  I am also doing weight lifting 3x a week at home, free style.  I also am using a variety of Jillians other dvds on the days that I don't lift weights.  So, for instance today, I did the 30 day Shred this morning and then lifted weights for 2 hours - then I'll go walking after work.  Tomorrow, 30 days shred and then Jillian's 6 Week 6 Pack, Thurs will be 30 Day Shred and then Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, One of the weight training days, I also do the No More Trouble Zones.  I'd love to have all her dvd's.  I just don't know when I'd work them in right now.<br /><br />Keep bringing the great workouts Jillian!<br /><br />Update:  Mar. 6, 2013:  I'm on Level 3 now:  I spent the past couple days with a virus (I believe) which attacked the muscles.  It didn't help that I worked out everyday - hard - for 7 days straight and didn't take a day off. I tried to lift weights, too sore and too tired to stick with it.<br /><br />Wednesday, today, I did Level 3 of 30 Day Shred but at the lowest level you can imagine. For instance, walking planks were done on my knees including the traveling push ups, the jump squats and rock star jumps were just getting my feet off the ground so basically a low level jump rope effort, (lol) scissor crunches involved my feet higher in the air - instead of a few inches from the ground, I was able to do the alternating punches holding dumbbells in the squat position, the butt kicks with dumbbells was basically getting my feet off the ground - bending my knees just hurts while jumping (hence, achy muscles) - I feel bruised still from the virus, the alternating jumping lunges were just low level lunging forward and back. It felt like it went quickly.<br /><br />I'm glad I did it - I worked up a sweat - I'm going to do a walking dvd next. Instead of spending 10 days on level 3 I believe I'll spend 13 due to the virus making me do it at such a low impact. I'm glad I did it!planks were done on my knees including the traveling push ups, the jump squats and rock star jumps were just getting my feet off the ground so basically a low level jump rope effort, (lol) scissor crunches involved my feet higher in the air - instead of a few inches from the ground, I was able to do the alternating punches holding dumbbells in the squat position, the butt kicks with dumbbells was basically getting my feet off the ground - bending my knees just hurts while jumping (hence, achy muscles) - I feel bruised still from the virus, the alternating jumping lunges were just low level lunging forward and back.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Have to say, when my book club picked this, I was not to psyched to spend what little time I have for myself reading about someone going for a hike. How wrong I was! I loved this book from start to finish. Strayed is a fantastic writer and made her story come to life in a touching, humorous, and human way. I've recommended it to everyone who listens!

B0061QD88S|5.0|This is a family classic that everyone in our family enjoyed!  The music in the movie was very good too.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|i am super sleepy having stayed up all night to finish this book. i loved the author's writing style and felt like i knew the characters. at key points she would switch into different points of view and while i usually find that distracting, in this book it worked seamlessly. i forgot i was reading a novel and felt like i was experiencing everything with them! i woke my husband up several times due to all the laughing and crying...and let me just say that while i love a good romance, this was the least SILLY romance i've read in a long time. this book is very real about love - what it means, how it feels and how it emerges. i think i'm going to have to read it again right away because i was so desperate to keep going i didn't fully savor the details. and then i'm going to find everything else that moyes has written!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Addictive and fun. Definitely worth the wait for it to load and hatch eggs. Great 4 all ages and has no violence.1,000,000,000out of 1,000,000,000.

0399226907|3.0|I love this book and so i ordered it for my child, but when i received it it was a small boardbook. The paperback size id soooo much better for reading amd for the illustrations.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It was great, We received this DVD on valentines day, since it is my boyfriends favorite type of movies.....(He is a hugh James Bond fan)  He was happy to see it as one of his gifts that day.  We both watched it together, even though we saw  it in the theater,<br />but it was nice to see it in the comfort of our home.
0887081770|2.0|Wonderful book, the text is great if you are able to see the mini print, i used a magnifying glass to read it. Nowhere did it say that this book was tiny thats why i bought it. Im so upset!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fan-freaking-tastic! There was never a dull moment. So full of  surprises and hidden agendas. Even better than the first one.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Farrell completely makes this movie. It's easy to compare him to Harrison Ford in Blade Runner. It's Farrell's angst and uncertainty - not his bravado that makes this movie. It's not (Arnold) Swarzenegger at all. And it's smart, I think, for the producers to realize that it could never have compared to him. As another Blade Runner, though, it works because the actor has as much uncertainty as the audience. Farrell discovers what has happened to him and it adds to the movie. Everything else - all of the sci fi and special effects add to the movie. Granted it may not be a weird classic like Blade Runner, but it definitely is worth seeing for a thrill. Credit the director for getting the actors to believe in the story line.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|If you like foreign intrigue and espionage no one does it better.  This story may have actually happened or it will in the future from one source or another.  A page turner for sure, Clancy keeps you right in the action, and makes one a believer in the unthinkable world in which we live.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|This is a fascinating, if profane account of Antonio Medez' exploits in the CIA, and gives one a pretty good idea of how effective agents of the CIA can be in their area of expertise.<br />Some of that is creating subterfuge that is designed to be valid and believable.<br />New identities that were given to the six in hiding.<br />On the other hand, it's better not to read an actual account of the escapade via Mendez, since the actual exit from Iran was quite boring, with the Iranians suspecting nothing.<br />Perhaps Iranians who do not have access to actual accounts will feel better about themselves because of the fictional version.<br />Mendez was one of the CIA people capable of creating passports and identities out of nothing, allowing them to walk through customs checkpoints with relative ease.<br />The fact that Affleck played up the Argo F Y was really unnecessary, and perhaps pleased the writers or producers who think this is clever or funny.<br />I think it would have been a better movie without it - and most of the White House profanity as well.<br />It could easily have been rated PG-13.<br />Mendez has written a book about his exploits, with much more detail.<br />[[ASIN:0147509734 Argo: How the CIA and Hollywood Pulled Off the Most Audacious Rescue in History]]
B004SDEP38|1.0|I rate it with one star because i can not rate it with less stars. It did not work for me.
B005GHN2GG|4.0|Well written and amusing. A world richly created and willingly perused. Characters one would wish to know in person and not just in story.
B009XTF8KQ|3.0|In the barely original plot of The Possession we watch a young girl get a box from a yard sale and with that box comes a demon that possesses her. Her divorced parents struggle with each other while the dad seems to almost immediately dive feet first into easily believing that a demon has possessed his daughter.<br /><br />I was entertained by the movie but it's not very scary and pretty predictable. The acting from Jeffrey Dean Morgan is great and the Jewish priest did an excellent job as well but every one else was mostly forgettable. The music was nothing special and there weren't that many effects to comment on or if there were they weren't impressive enough to think about.<br /><br />Several scenes would build to a high point but would then suddenly cut off to a new scene. It was as though the writers had written themselves into a corner and were unsure of how to end a scene so they just didn't and began the next one.<br /><br />Even though my review seems mostly negative I was interested all the way through I just had to keep stopping myself from noticing a lot of silly and easily avoidable mistakes. It's a very toned down horror flick but it's an entertaining one if you don't really think about it.<br /><br />Defiantly rent or get it from the library first because most adult horror fans will not enjoy it but it could be a good one for some people new to the genre or who aren't into horror movies that much.
B009NPA3MS|2.0|I really like Phillip's voice from watching him on idol.  Was excitied when he won but I didn't care for this CD, too much instrument and not enough of his great voice.

1250007208|5.0|Cinder is a cyborg (a human with machine parts). She has no memory before she became such at the age of 11. She lives with her guardian and her two daughters (the only family she's ever known) and supports the family by working as a mechanic. Her life is mundane and she is despised not only by society for what she is, but also by her guardian. The country and world is fighting a losing battle with a new disease. Cinder has been untouched by the disease until one day her \\"step-sister\\" and the only one to ever show her kindness contracts it. This leads to changes that have her question everything she thought about herself and who she is.<br /><br />Love this book! I thought the whole premise was creative and new. I loved the characters and the mix of sci-fi and fairytale. I knew what Cinder was going to find out quite early, but I still enjoyed reading how she would come to the conclusion herself. Content is also clean. I can't wait to read the next one!

B001A5HBJC|3.0|Lots of my friends recommended Mad Men; so my wife and I tried it, but stopped after a few episodes. Then some more friends recommended it. We tried again, this time we got probably 8 or 9 episodes in, but it wasn't enough going on of interest to make us want to continue (my wife had more problems with it than me).

B007US9NA8|4.0|Take the time to read this if you truly want to bodybuilding, gain muscle, or just look great and be in great physical health. It is worth the time to read the entire book. With that said, some of the book is outdated and there has been new research , however it will give you a lot of knowledge without going back to school or getting a personal trainers license.

B0018ARN6U|5.0|Marc Bolan was an older man trapped in a younger man's brain. In his world, unicorns and faeries still ran amok, bongos were still pretty cool and twee spacey poetry made for good lyrics. But something happened by the time he expanded his band into a full unit and set forward with \\"Electric Warrior.\\" Bolan discovered the magic three  chord boogie and blues and found out that sleazy grooves were so much more fun that medieval trippiness.<br /><br />Which made \\"Electric Warrior\\" arguably the first brilliant glam album. While David Bowie, producer Tony Visconti and Bolan were pals, it was another year before Bowie delivered \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" to the world and really shored up the UK Glam scene. \\"Electric Warrior\\" managed transatlantic success, bringing a taste of Bolan-mania to this continent via \\"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\\" and that single's stride to the US Top Ten. Yet, despite the \\"Electric\\" part of the title, Bolan still showed remarkable restraint. Only in the final \\"Rip Off\\" does the band go for some floorboard shaking.<br /><br />But the real winners here, from \\"Bang a Gong\\" to the Chuck Berry inspired \\"Jeepester\\" and the handicapping blues of \\"Lean Woman Blues\\" rock in their own sublime way. Bolan was still enthralled by his hippy-dippy days, but it seemed now confined only to the lyrics (sample from \\"Planet Queen\\": \\"Flying saucer take me away, give me your daughter,\\" or the bulk of the still sultry \\"Bang a Gong.\\" It made its peace with folk, rock and shot-gun marriage to bubblegum, and you'll hear traces of everyone from Bowie to Mott to Slade (hey, if \\"Hot Love\\" and \\"Bang a Gong\\" aren't godfathers to \\"Cum On Feel The Noise,\\" you tell me what is) across this album.<br /><br />I'd also advise to find the expanded Rhino version that includes \\"Hot Love\\" as a bonus track and seven other bonus tracks, including an acoustic run through of \\"Planet Queen,\\" and \\"Raw Ramp,\\" a bonus single and a cool T Rex Electric Warrior interview. It's well worth it, just for \\"Hot Love\\" alone.lone.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|Where do you go when you're elderly but still have a desire for adventure, are in need of a cheap medical treatment and/or left with no other place to go because your native homeland is far too expensive? You go to India, of course. It's affordable, exotic and a great place in which to find yourself. Lured by advertisements and bolstered with visions of a life of leisure, an eclectic group of British retirees arrives to find the Marigold Hotel a mere shell of its former glory. And though their living situation is less than expected, they are all profoundly affected by the experience of living in this foreign new land. In their own way, each of them walks a veritable path of self discovery and learns that life and love can begin anew even when you think you're way past your prime.<br /><br />I rented The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel on a whim and I'm glad that I did. Based off a popular novel of the same name, the movie tells the story of several cash-poor English retirees who travel to India looking for sex, love, rebirth, closure and/or adventure. Naturally, things go awry for the bunch starting with their arrival at the less than desirable Marigold Hotel. But through a series of follies, trials and adventures the gang grows closer to one another and they manage to learn a valuable lesson in the process: it's never too late to seek out new beginnings. Played by the creme de la creme of British acting royalty, the cast of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, inspires and dazzles.<br /><br />Dame Maggie Smith plays the feisty and untouchable xenophobe, Muriel, who comes to India unwillingly to receive a hip replacement. If there's one thing Dame Smith can play, it's surly and she does so with a wryness and bitterness that is both sad and cheeky at the same time. And what makes her so lovable is not only the humour behind her situation, but the redemption that comes along with it. Actually, this goes for all of the cast. Then we have Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton as your testy, argumentative old couple. Nighy is open, he's an explorer whereas Wilton is unwilling and set in her ways. They come face to face with a drastic decision regarding the nature of their marriage. Tom Wilkinson, as Graham Dashwood, comes to India looking for his long-lost love. Then there's Dame Judi Dench as our main narrator, Evelyn Greenslade. She goes to India after the death of her husband seeking closure but really as more of an escape. What she finds, however, is a fresh start and a new outlook on life.<br /><br />Most of the action centers in and around the Marigold Hotel with Dev Patel playing its struggling manager, Sonny Kapoor. Every time he takes the screen, he steals the scenes with his fervent hope and optimism. Perhaps what I love the most, though, is that India itself is another prime character of the film. We're given a bird's eye view of the vibrancy of Jaipur from the crowded streets to the colourful markets and the serene customs. It's a whimsical and refreshing vacation folding out right in front of your eyes. I think what makes the setting stand out so much is the allusion created using the stark contrast between the India's progression and the old colonial habits of the British characters living there.  It's poignant and powerful.<br /><br />My only real issues with the movie are that there's a number of cast members and story lines to follow and it can be a bit to keep up with. And it's inevitable that you are eventually going to connect with some of them more than others. I won't deny, the movie can at times, be a tad predictable especially near the end. You kind of know that everything is going to be wrapped up in a perfect little bow despite the issues that have arisen. But that's okay because it's supposed to be a feel-good kinda film and if there's one thing this movie has, great acting talent aside, it's heart. There's nothing more perfect than that because we all know, all's well that ends well, right?<br /><br />Food for Thought: The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a sweet, irreverent, cheeky film featuring some of the greatest British actors of our time. While it can be a bit predictable at times, the movie's ultimate message is an endearing one that speaks to the heart. This isn't just a film for folks in their golden years, it's one of those powerful movies that can be enjoyed by adults of all ages because the themes are super relatablel. This movie will make you laugh and cry, smile and admire. And if anything, you'll be in a state of wanderlust for quite some time.he Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a sweet, irreverent, cheeky film featuring some of the greatest British actors of our time.

Only disappointment was that by buying the 2-disc version that there would be a lot of behind the scenes bits with the option of English, which there weren't (OK if you speak Italian).

B006LSZECO|2.0|I love how the story went on.  It was clever with plenty of twists.  And after all that, I thought us as readers deserved a bit of a predictable, expected happy ending.  But no, I was left hanging.  I hated Amy towards the end and I just wanted her gone.  But the author seemed to be thinking like Amy, because that was what we all expected so she didn't give it to us.  That's why I only gave this book 2 stars.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I have always been kind of a fan of Jack White. What I mean by that is it seems when it comes to his songs I either find I really like it or hate it. When it comes to the songs of his that I enjoy listening to then I don't tire of listening to them. As for the songs I don't care for I find for me they are too far out there or maybe I just don't get it. I don't know. There is no doubt though about Jack White he has proved himself to be a major force in rock music today and I am always ready to listen to anything new he might have out.<br /><br />So certainly when I heard the news he had come out with a solo album titled \\"Blunderbuss\\" and hearing all the rave reviews it was getting from music critics and fans alike I knew I had to check it out. What I found upon listening to Jack's newest album is one of the best albums that has been released in the last few years. Of course I was expecting when I was going to listen to the album was that I would find a few of the songs I would really like and the rest I wouldn't care much for. I could not have been more wrong in my expectations when I finished listening to \\"Blunderbuss\\". I didn't just like a few of the songs on the album. I loved all of them. From the first song on the disc to last one I was captivated by the words and music. Then pretty turned around and played the CD once more.<br /><br />The sound and feel of this album by Jack White is certainly different in some ways from his earlier works with groups like The White Stripes or The Raconteurs. One of the things I did before I began writing my review of \\"Blunderbuss\\" was to go read some of the others reviews people have written on this album, especially those reviews where the writer only gave one or two stars for the album. One of the common things those who did not like the album had to say about \\"Blunderbuss\\" was it was not like his earlier works and sounds too different. One reviewer even said he didn't like the fact that a piano was being played on some of the songs! Really? As I just mentioned the album is certainly different from his past work and to me that is what makes this album so good. To me it shows that as a both a songwriter and a musician Jack is looking to grow and experiment with new sounds and ideas in music. Jack White doesn't want to become stagnet or predictable as a musician but rather to expand it and seek new directions to go to as he continues to develope his talent. To me that is a good thing and important thing for any performer, no matter what field of art or entertainment they may be in, to do. To me the entire album totally works. For the hard core Jack White fan, and yes I would not include myself as a hard core fan of his more like a casual fan, they may be taken aback by the different sound and style but to me this is still classic Jack White.<br /><br />I also think this album represents some of the best songwriting he has ever done. The first time I listened to the album I read the lyrics that were in the booklet that came with the CD. It struck me as I was reading along that in some ways Jack Whites' writng style is somewhat simular to Bob Dylans. Not political the way some of Dylans songs can certainly be. I mean in how White, like Dylan, uses words in conveying feelings or an idea. White is a craftsman at writing a clever lyric, again like Dylan, and looking at situations and ideas from a different persective that most of us would not have thought of. For me this is what makes \\"Blunderbuss\\" so interesting to listen to.<br /><br />I certainly would recommend this album to anyone who may not be familier with Jack White as a good way to be introduced to his music though I would also at the same time recommend you give a listen to hes earlier works with The White Stripes and The Raconteurs as well. For the fans of Jack White who have not heard this album yet I would of course recommend listening to this album but just add to listen to \\"Blunderbuss\\" with an open mind. You too like some others may find this a lot different then anything Jack White may have done in the past but I think you will find this to still be some of the best work he has done to date.rs may find this a lot different then anything Jack White may have done in the past but I think you will find this to still be some of the best work he has done to date.

Maybe it requires an update but I don't have the motivation so I returned this Blu-ray boxset.<br /><br />Long story short: open the cardboard shipping box in a way that you can reuse it in case you find yourself returning the boxset
0374275637|5.0|This is one of the 50 best books I have ever read.  Research-based explanation of how the mind makes decisions, Full of thoughtful consideration about how we make wrong decisions,  The author uses his own failures and successes (as a Nobel prize winner there were a few of the latter) to explain state-of-the art scientific theory on the brain.  Disappointing  when it recycles psychological theory I learned in college decades ago under new names, but otherwise an excellent, informative read.

1400069289|5.0|Great book.  Worth the read.  I appreciated the perspective around habit formation.  I would highly recommend reading \\"Outliers\\" and \\"Drive, by Daniel Pink\\" as well.  Habit recognition is a great skill to have especially to help break them and form good ones.  Just what habits to form, practice, and aspire towards are the next steps.  Great book though, I think there are a lot of important points of interest in here.  I felt it concluded a little quickly though and there is certainly room for further research on different types of making and breaking habits for the general population.<br /><br />Check it out, you will be glad you did.
B002ZJCQT2|4.0|Physicist Chad Orzel talks to his dog. This is not all that unusual. Many pet owners talk to their pets and dogs make particularly good listeners. What might be a little strange is that Professor Orzel talks to his German Sheppard mix Emma about quantum physics. It turns out that dogs have a good intuitive grasp of quantum physics so they are able to have long conversations on quantum physics. In How to Teach Physics to Your Dog, Chad Orzel relates these conversations in which he explains to an eager Emma the basics of quantum physics. Emma interrupts his explanations with just the sort of questions the reader might happen to have. The dog and physicist talk about such topics as the uncertainty principle, virtual particles, quantum tunneling and entanglement.<br />It's a fun idea and Chad Orzel does a terrific job explaining physics to the lay reader in the guise of talking to his dog. He seems to have a good feel for how a dog acts and thinks, and I have no trouble imagining that if a dog could talk about physics she would be just as excitable, and as easily distracted by squirrels, bunnies, and treats.<br />The most important chapter in this book must be the last one, Beware of Evil Squirrels. Here Professor Orzel warns the read of the misuses and outright scams involving quantum physics. There are any number of con artists and New Age frauds who make use of scientific sounding terminology to mislead their victims into believing that one can get free energy from \\"vacuum energy\\" or heal oneself of all diseases by imagining oneself to be perfectly healthy. As Orel explains, despite the many weird and wonderful manifestations of quantum physics, it is not magic, and follows the same sort of rules as anything else in the universe, including the common sense rule that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.<br />I found How to Teach Physics to Your Dog to be appealing and informative. I think that some of the explanations were a bit hard to follow but that is perhaps more my fault than the writer's.perhaps more my fault than the writer's.

Unbelievable saga of an urban poet whose creative gifts went unappreciated in the US but became revered as a prophet in S Africa as the grip of white supremacy and apartheid loosened in that troubled nation.  As amazing as this story of rediscovery, rebirth, and humility is.... the story of how the film was conceived, born and gained fame is almost as startling.  A must watch if you love music, musicians, family, and the prophetic word....
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|When I first heard about The Walking Dead, I was a little skeptical, I wasn't sure what to think about it so I didnt really pay any attention to it until I started hearing more and more good things about it then I saw the first season on sale during the holidays and was like eh what the hell, so I bought it and every single episode ended with a cliffhanger that left me screaming at my tv to go to the next episode. The way they did the walkers in this series is unbelievable. They are so realistic and authentic that its just crazy how awesome they look. Before I bought the series I had also heard that Norman Reedus was in this show and I had already liked him from when he was in The Boondock Saints movies so that kept me waiting for when he was going to be in the episode and without a doubt he is my favorite character. If you want a good show to leave you on the edge of your seat with awesome characters and good action in pretty much every episode, this is the show for you.

0393338398|5.0|If I were to separate books about baseball (or almost any team sport) into 4 categories, they would be:<br />1) player (or someone else involved) biography<br />2) history of a team<br />3) statistical analysis<br />4) &#34;how to&#34; manual<br /><br />I don't play ball anymore, so the 4th category doesn't hold much interest to me anymore. The other 3 do - and &#34;Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game&#34; is a fantastic blend of the other three categories.<br /><br />This mathematics major (albeit long removed from college) appreciates the emphasis on statistics, and on the explanation of those statistics so that even the math neophyte, or someone long removed from college, can understand the concepts.  (The author does not delve into more complex statistical theory.)<br /><br />The biography fan appreciates the personal looks at some of the players on the Oakland A's baseball team - and of its management - and of some of the folks who took statistical analysis to the next level.  And the book itself unfolds a year in the life of the Oakland A's.<br /><br />One of the baseball insiders I know - OK, the only baseball insider I know even a little bit - told me that he did not believe the underlying assumptios that Moneyball makes on how to build a professional baseball game on a budget.  Having read the book, I can see his point on one hand - but on the other, I fear he totally missed the boat.  The point of Moneyball, as I saw it, is &lt;i>**not**&lt;/i> &#34;do it this way&#34;.  Rather it is, &#34;Question conventional wisdom&#34;.  If you're doing something because &#34;everyone in baseball knows ...&#34;, PROVE IT!!  Study the historic results.  And see if the numbers play themselves out as you expect.  If so, great.  If not, then have the courage to challenge the assumptions and go in another direction.  Billy Beane, the GM who serves as the anchor for Moneyball, found his approach and had great regular season - but not playoff - success.  Perhaps you will find an approach even more effective than that Beane came up with.<br /><br />For my money, this is the best book on basebally that I've ever read.ind an approach even more effective than that Beane came up with.<br /><br />For my money, this is the best book on basebally that I've ever read.
B00821OX98|4.0|I am new to Amazon Prime, and am discovering that I LOVE watching a complete season at a time! This is a well-done Sci-Fi series - most tend to get a little cheesy. I was engaged from the beginning, at first trying to figure out what was going on, but then as I got deeper into the season, the characters caught my interest and began to matter to me. Of course, I love Noah Wylie, and this was a different character from most.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it kills time if you are at work or just very very bored just pick up this game in began playing you can collect coins level up real fast

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love diary of a wimpy kid books. Now I have read all of his books. Gregory is my favourite character. I have all of his books except for this one as a book form. This is the only one I have on a kindle fire HD. I like reading it better on the kindle fire HD than a book. Off you like this series you should also read \\"Dork Diaries\\" it is also about a kid having trouble in school.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|As most of us know angry birds is a popular and enjoyable game. But the ads with this game has gotten way out of hand. After every play there is an ad of some kind. lf you are look for an free ad-free angry bird game, try angry birds rio (ad free) it's a much better choice.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like the designs. It has some nice alarms. I also like the weather.<br />It could be a little dimmer when lit.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am obsessed with this series!!!  The only downfall is that you have to wait a whole YEAR before the next season is released and there are never enough episodes:(
B00009RAJH|5.0|One of the best collections of orginal songs by Fleetwood Mac, I would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates good music
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I am using this turntable in a manner I have not seen in the reviews I have read. Specifically:If you happen to have a Bose Wave Radio, and don't want to spend a lot of money on a receiver and speakers, you can hook the turntable up to the Bose, and have a small system that doesn't take up much space and sounds good. You use the \\"Y\\" cable from the turntable, add two barrel connectors, then put the remaining end of it into the auxilliary at the back of the Bose. I used an existing Bose, and am getting a new one that will match the turntable's color. The sound is good and it's almost like an instant stereo system. I bought some new 180 gram reissues, and they sound fine. P.S. I have no affiliation with Bose. YOU MUST MOVE THE SWITCH AT THE BACK OF THE TURNTABLE TO LINE!!!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I had the first leps world and i loved it, this one is even better!  It has a better set up and great graphics!  This is a must have game especially if you liked the first one!
B009B8YZIK|4.0|Rented this movie to kill time one afternoon.... The cadet training and other<br />cadet parts at the beginning is way too long compared to the action once it<br />starts.  So its like 3/4 cadet story..and 1/4 action.<br /><br />  But once the action started, it blew me away with a very good audio track , effects, creatures and other good stuff...why oh why did it take soo long , and<br />why was the action part to short lived....oh well cant win them all...but it did<br />make me a fan and i hope to see another movie in the works...<br />It really rocks once it starts..
B0089EHWQE|2.0|I was really looking for more since the major aspects of this story relate to my real life and for the most part it's not a common love story.  Didn't think her family was wacky but lovable at all, they were a touch disturbing. It did touch on some realistic daily parts of a disabled life but disappointing overall, maybe a little zoloft needed to be thrown in the mix.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun and easy..perfect release in a busy schedule. Should be even more fun in the higher levels as bonuses increase.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|The intro is absolutely the best part of this movie.  Adele's song along with the creativity of the into is amazing and, dare I say, even mesmerizing.  Too bad the movie had to start after that.  Like many bad action movies you have to suspend belief just far too often to enjoy it much.  Sure, the action is good, but that can't be the entire basis for a film.
B0007939NO|5.0|I must have seen this years ago because I adore Gene Kelly but I can't believe I didn't  remember it. Gene Kelly and Van Johnson find themselves in a magical village that ceases to exist once nightfall hits and l00 years go by; they wake up l00 years later and start where they left off. Kelly falls in love and has to make a decision on whether to stay with the gal he fell in love with or go back to 'normalcy' and the grind of city life in New York. There is dancing and singing throughout and Cyd Charisse  dances and sings with Kelly creating pure magic. I never knew Van Johnson to dance but he can hoof-it like nobody's business.  This movie is a  delectable treat to be watched again and again (and I intend to). If you love musicals, if you love Kelly and Johnson then get moving and order this piece of heaven. It is delightful, joyous, and one that has lasted through time! - just like the little village. All I can say is WOW, YIPPEE AND HURRAY FOR BRIGADOON!
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I kept waiting for a good plot, but the book coasted along with the same lame storyline of girl meets bad boy, bad boy changes for girl.  Most of the book I found myself saying \\"Come on.\\"  Good writing, I will try another book when written, but this one was not very entertaining and more than slightly unbelievable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Like its all we do at school in r free timeits solo awesome its keeps u not bored and stuff woo its goof to get ti's game its fun
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game is the sequel to cut the rope and I LOVE IT. A lot of fun new twists and if you ever come across this review the game is not half bad and no glitches!!!!!!!
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|Other reviews will tell you more about the story that I will.  I will say that the story was written in a non-fluid way that made getting through the text rather slow, but the story and it's originality were great.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in trying out one of Philip Dick's works.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This app is kinda odd you can make them bald and they won't notice at all I gave it four star because it's good but it being weird lost it one weirdest game I ever played all I can say is wow
B0043UB0EI|1.0|I felt that this show was kinda like a multi-hour version of Gladiator (with Russel Crow).  I liked Gladiator, was not as thrilled with this version of the story.  However, if you only need to see topless, almost nude women, you might be more inclined.

I use my iPad at home and at work i take it with me wherever i go but the only problem is i can't use it and charge it at the same time because of the apple lightning charging and syncing cable its too short!!! I tried many aftermarket long cables and they all failed to charge my iPad, Until Griffin made this cable i bought it as soon as it was released and i can confirm that it works!!! It syncs and charges my iPad 4 and iPhone 5 without any problems, I higly recommend this product...
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game! It was hard to stop playing it.<br />Kept you going back for more. Sad it is over. Thanks!

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am not a constant gamer as I find most games boring after a while. BUT I discovered Temple Run 2 and I am hooked! You will not regret getting this game! It is amazingly addictive!
B0082P6JZA|4.0|Sometimes you want to watch something that doesn't require a lot of brain power, lacks some of the history of James Bond, but has all of the action. This series has become like an old friend, with just enough cheese to connect the driving and fight scenes together. It's got the puns and the characters you'd expect from what, in some ways, feels like a version of James Bond trapped in/near a car. This one doesn't dissapoint and Jason Statham makes it as believable as it can be. He's not winning an Oscar with his performance, but he won another rental with Transporter 3 - and I suppose that's what the studio was after. Looking for fast cars, great chase scenes, inventive fight scenes, etc.? You'll find it here!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product or game as we call it has been very fun and addictive lots of people I know play this game a lot I even think that y'all should make it were you can play it on a regular computer for free because y'all will get more tips and notes and rates people even put it on facebook a lot I think this is a great game that many people enjoy playing make more and exiciting things in this game so no one would want to put it down.

B00646UU5Y|5.0|I love the series.  Would hope to see a follow up.  The characters made it fun and exciting.  Strongly suggest you watch it from season 1 to get the most out of it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|it suddenly stop loading so I cant play anymore :( I unstaill it hoping it will it will be fix that way but sadly not :(&lt; 3 I don't think I can ever play this game again. I had so many upgrades purchase already...
B007EJ6S92|5.0|This is the best album Moonspell has had yet.  All of the songs on Alpha Noir are very good and heavy.  The songs on the bonus disc Omega White remind me of the Darkness and Hope album, one of my favorites.  Definitely a must have for any Moonspell fan.

B000GDH9JQ|5.0|This movie arrived on time. It arrived flawless and my Father has enjoyed watching it several times.  The review was spot on.  Great job,
B006Z00R1Q|3.0|This is a step-back in time and is filmed Blair-Witch Project like. The audience waits for the monster under the bed or in the closet as it may be to jum p out any minute, but it is more like Ghost Hunters on the Syfy channel.  The suspense does build until the twist at the end which makes the movie worth watching. It is a Friday night with popcorn kind of film.
B000SZK41M|5.0|Of all the action movie franchises spawned in the last 30 years, this is the most memorable.  Bruce Willis was the first &#34;regular&#34; action hero that I loved.  Hans Gruber was the first bad guy I loved as well.  Hilarious, action packed, a great stroll down memory lane.  If you've never seen it... GET IT NOW!
B00AODKSAA|5.0|This is a great preview. It captures interest and desire to watch more right away and continues to that pace throughout the extended preview. Can't wait for the release of the video!
0761171703|5.0|For my bachelor's degree, I studied theatre and dance, and although I'm not a great dancer, I am amazed at the ability to control your body with such precision. This book is the epitome of that precision, and puts it into an everyday context. I love the book, and think the photography is simply stunning, though, I have to admit that I'm quite jealous that Jordan Matter created these beautiful images and not me. I got into photography because of dance, I wanted to capture the beauty, and at some point that got away from me and I started photographing pets and products and weddings. This reminds me of why I got into this field, and what it was that made me fall in love with the arts. I highly recommend this book, as I've shown it to many non-dancer friends and they all say the same thing. It is inspirational, creative, and most importantly, extremely enjoyable!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Liked the story line starting about halfway through.  Initially I struggled to understand what the fuss was about but once the twists started then it got interesting.  I think I would have liked a different ending though.  Left me feeling open and without closure.  Maybe it's so there's an opportunity for another installment?  Overall an interesting read.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book really had a lot of twists. I wasn't expecting the plot at all. I enjoyed this book a lot.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game is really fun and the colors look cool. I like that you can upgrade your weapons by collecting coins from the enemy :) awesome game.
B004I744AS|5.0|It's so nice to have this on hand since everyone needs a dictionary from time to time and with all the word games I play, I'm sure it will come in real handy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it never stops unexpected I kids play so do I all the time.  my youngest plays and losess but does not care
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I absolutely love this game. My grandson got me into Angry Birds Star Wars edition that I downlowaded in my pc for him and we had just absolutely hours of fun with it. So when I don't really want to use my mind in word games I go to this game and love playing it myself.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I am happy that I have a case that is water proof but it comes with some fall backs.  If you talk your sound is very muffled and distant- I feel I have to YELL every time I am on the phone for anyone to  hear me.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Absolutely love this game and I only have two friends that play it with me, but wish i had more. It is so much fun to play.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is really nice. You gain experience and money relatively quickly. You also can earn invest points ... it is really great.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This puzzle game is both fun and challenging in its own way. The quirky characters and dialogue added to the enjoyment for me. It was a good combo of different puzzles.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|The book is a candid look at the growing up of a girl.  It provides an<br />interesting look at how girls grow up and what they can expect.<br />A definite read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading Hopeless I decided to check out the reviews for once and I was astounded at how rude and overly critical some people are! I loved the characters, especially Sky and Holder. The storyline is believable, intense yet light at the right times, and brought more than a few tears to my eyes. Colleen I have read all 3 of your books on kindle and can't wait for more...BRAVO!
B005LAII08|5.0|This is a great movie and when I saw it in theaters it was a must for Dvd purchase. This was the best deal I came across and I purchased for the 3D. Thank you!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Actually a little harder than I first thought!!!!<br />Well worth it and it is fun for all ages, big and small.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|I was never a history buff having trained as an engineer studying sciences, and I have learned a great deal from reading this as well as having been captivated by what I take is a realistic albeit fictional account of the horrors of WW2. A must read.
0399245030|5.0|I bought this for my son after someone gave him \\"This Moose Belongs to Me\\" by the same author.  It's not as dryly hilarious as the moose book, but the illustrations are so sweet and adorable and my 23 month old loves it.<br /><br />It's a simple tale about a little penguin who ends up on a boy's door step, and the boy tries to help the supposedly lost penguin find his way home.  When he finally takes him back to the South Pole, he realizes that the penguin in fact only wanted a friend.<br /><br />We love the pictures and the story.
B004WR125O|5.0|I wish my Onkyo receiver had built-in wireless, but I'm pleased that their adapter is fairly cheap and seamless to use.  This little gadget allows me to stream music from my iPhone over my wireless network using oRemote and AirMusic to my Onkyo TX-NR809, which is a great performance bargain in the world of receivers.

B0074MZSWW|2.0|I heard the Alabama Shakes for the first time on Saturday Night Live, much like many others. Their live performance really impressed me, so I purchased the Alabama Shakes' debut album 'Boys & Girls' while shopping at Target a few days later.<br /><br />This is the best worst-mixed album I have ever heard.<br /><br />Let me be clear - Alabama Shakes is a fantastic band. Their sound is a great mix of rock, blues, classic R&B and soul. I really like them and will attempt to see them live if they tour near my home. If they can keep it together, the Alabama Shakes will have a long and fruitful career.<br /><br />This album though... I can't begin to put into words how bad the sound mixing is. Upon my first listen, I noticed all kinds of loud buzzing noises, vocal crackles and peculiar audio distortions. Much like a corrupted digital audio file, the audio has these strange blips and missing segments at random throughout the album. For an example - at the end of the first track \\"Hold On\\", there's this excruciating buzz that screams forth at the 2:58 minute mark and continues on until the 3:23 minute mark. At that point, it devolves into a vicious white-noise type of static. It will totally distract you from the music. Many of the vocals sound as if they were recorded behind a wall, or as if the microphone was a mile away. At other times, the audio distorts like the microphones are just really cheap; the unclear vocals are full of static. The individual instruments bleed over into each other, producing a strange humming drone that will annoy you without end. You'll also hear odd thumps and bumps at random; did someone kick their boots off or drop a book? You'll think so after giving 'Boys & Girls' a listen!<br /><br />I don't know if the poor audio quality is a mistake or digitally added-in to make the album sound retro. If this bad mixing is on purpose, then they failed. I'm an audiophile with thousands of albums on vinyl and cassette. Even those old records and tapes don't sound this bad!<br /><br />At first, I thought I had a defective compact disc. I returned my copy to Target for another new copy. Sadly, that disc sounded exactly the same. The disc isn't defective - it's just horrible audio mixing! The guilty party is a fellow named Andrija Tokic at Bomb Shelter Studios of Nashville.<br /><br />Like I said before - this is the BEST worst-mixed album I've ever heard. If not for the bad mixing, I'd have given this album 4.5 stars. Can we get the Alabama Shakes in a decent recording studio and have them re-record this album? Please?
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My kids were so thrilled to finally have this movie in dvd with all the extra footage. My kids danced around the living room with every song, laughed at the snake, and sang-a-long to the music videos.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|Enjoyed listening to this while driving a distance in the car.  Just a beautiful album.  Lovely vocals, easy on the ear and good for your mood.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|There's nothing that's bad about any of the songs. I've listened to it over and over and I still love all of it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This works very good with my kindle HD. I would recommend this to all my friends if I had any.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Finally a Bond movie with little computer generated action. It goes back to the roots of older Bond movies and is done very well.  The last half is the best.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|what can i say? i couldnt stop watching. this is the only show that is constantly making me cheer, get angry or sad. i watched the whole season in 2 days i would kill for 10 more episodes. I think this show is much better not having read the books since i have no idea whats coming, Im just watching it play out. ill read the books when the show is done to see whats different. but this season packed a way bigger punch than the first, the wolfs are big as hell(but id like to see them kill more), the dragons have arrived(all though very small at this point), john gos over the wall, bran has become a very interesting and most likely powerfull character, there is quit a bit of magic in this season, the special effects look great and last but not least we get our first look at the white walkers(and they dont dissapoint). so i cant wait for the third season to start and everybody go buy this one its better than any movie your going to watch.
B00AF6B22E|1.0|I cannot believe Denzel or ay other notable actor would be a part of this very fake and drug laden movie. As a senior Captain for a major airline and previous MD80 driver which this movie portrays, it is very fake from the beginning. Even from a non pilots perspective this movie is more about heavy drug use in hookers and very poor dialogue.  Its also slow moving and computer generated. Please do not waist your money buying this piece of junk. Rent it if you wish but that would be a mistake too as its that bad. If you want to see a much better and more realistic movie about flight or a pilot movie, try to find the old VHS movie called THE PILOT with Cliff Robertson. He died recently BTW. It is fairly accurate regarding the flying scenes and also portrays an alcoholic pilot but much more believable and entertaining.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|0 the music he is an awsome singer,  received quickly wow wow wow wow  wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
B005G4TJUC|1.0|Okay... for starters, I liked the first two Transformers movies; they're what got me BACK into Transformers. I know the second one had some serious flaws, but I enjoyed it for the mindless action Bay-film that it was.<br /><br />Now, as I said, Michael Bay's movies got me back into Transformers. As a result, I watched some of the shows, did some research on characters and backstory, and played the High Moon Studios games. I made myself a die-hard Transformers fan, and when I saw MORE classic characters were going to be in THIS, Dark of the Moon, I was thrilled...<br /><br />Then I saw it and ranted the next few days.<br /><br />To sum up, pros and cons;<br /><br />PROS:<br />*Apollo 11 references were cool<br />*The epic, tragic feel of the attack on Chicago and the havoc wrought on humanity<br />*Less of Bay's racial-based humor, though not entirely absent.<br /><br />CONS (oh boy):<br />*Decepticons STILL suck; Megatron, Starscream and the other Decepticons can barely so much as scratch a HUMAN, let alone an Autobot. Very anti-climatic and a betrayal to their characters; Decepticons, especially Megatron, are supposed to be BAD-@$$. I was hoping they'd make Starscream and Megatron better, like in the first movie opposed to the second, but they just suck MORE.<br /><br />*The new chick. I wasn't biased because I was a die-hard Megan Fox fan, but this new chick was pointless. She doesn't do ANYTHING to help other than irk a useless Megatron, and the first shot of her is her tush. Basically, Bay was like \\"OH CRAP, our hot girl's gone, gotta get another- OH LOOK A VICTORIAN SECRET MODEL GET HER @$$ IN HERE!\\" What the hell?

B002D0L0R2|5.0|I hate musicals. I dont like John Travolta. I should've hated this movie. But it just wasn't possible. It fantastic and fun. I watch this movie all the time and don't see that coming to an end anytime soon
B0053O89WY|2.0|I remember September 2007 being a great month for geek culture on TV. It saw the inception of shows such as &#34;Chuck&#34;, &#34;Reaper&#34; (an ill fated show simply because the CW didn't know what to do with it), and a hillarious little sitcom about two insufferable nerds whose lives are upheaved when a simple, yet incredibly vivacious gal from the midwest moves across the hall. In subsequent seasons, they managed to keep the geek-centric formula firmly in place, yet allowing the characters to grow.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2011/2012 which brought us a fifth season, and it barely resembles it's first four seasons. While there are a few classic moments here, it just isn't nearly what it once was. There are dozens of bawdy sitcoms riddling the airwaves these days. Most of which have no heart or inventive writing. It would seem to me that this show seems to be moving in that direction. Virtually gone are the inside physics jokes, nods to geek culture (comics, movies, video games) and in their place are the kind of plotlines and character development one would associate with shows like &#34;Two And A Half Men&#34;. Characters like Amy (while amusing when initially introduced) have gone completely off the reservation into the realm of...well...creepy. What should have been a great recurring character has completely overstayed her welcome and has become the albatross to a show once sailing with agreeable wind and blue skies. Bernadette is yet another character that has overstayed her welcome. No matter how you sell it, I just can't buy Wolowitz's capacity to keep a girl like Bernadette and the longer he does...the less I buy it. Raj's quasi homosexual tendencies, while charming and inventive at first, have become old hat and are, well, rather dull. They really seem to have lost their grip on how to write Raj this season.<br /><br />Leonard's prowess when it comes to the opposite sex has also taken a quantum leap into the realm of the absurd. Between Raj's incrediblygorgeous sister and his little run in with a very sexy comic book fan, I have to wonder how and when Leonard got all this &#34;game&#34;! The Penny attraction, I get. He's basically the sweet guy next door in a world of men that have treated her badly (as she's constantly attracted to the worst sort of men there are). Now we are expected to believe that, as of season five, his awkwardness has all but gone and he's able to attract such INCREDIBLY beautiful women that would be (in reality) WAY out of his league. He's not a bad looking guy...but come on!!<br /><br />What used to be something I looked forward to every week has become that kind of show that is easily dismissable.<br /><br />Such a shame, because this was once one of the most inventive and original shows on the airwaves.

B002R88G5E|3.0|This was a really interesting story to read and it gave me some insight into what life must be like in war torn areas today.  It also opened my eyes to how life is for many Muslim woman.  I was engaged in the story line.<br />The sad part about the book was the huge number of typing errors.  At times they made it very hard to read as I had to re-read all the time to sort it out.  I just wished I could have been able to fix them all so when I read it again I don't have those problems.  I think this was because I did not purchase this book from Amazon...next time I will!
B003Y5HWK4|3.0|The acting is top notch (especially Buscemi, as expected); the look is fantastic; it's still a rich era to explore, despite already having been mined to death, but something's just... missing. I simply kept expecting more from the overall arc.<br /><br />I always watch HBO show after they've aired, and I've had this set for about seven months, and still haven't felt compelled to see the second season,which has been available for almost that long.
B002RI9PS6|5.0|This was an endearing story highlighting some of the difficulties immigrants encounter.  There were many 'laugh out loud' moments for me in the story, while at the same time it opened my eyes to yet another culture different from my own.

B002U3CCBK|5.0|This was a great read.  I was spellbound from the beginning to the end.  I enjoyed the way each of the characters personalities unfurled as the book progressed.  I rushed out to get the DVD after reading it and I was thoughrally disappointed in how different the movie was to the book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very fast read. Definitely keeps you going till its done. Ending very odd and somewhat unsatisfactory but could not think of any other way to end!

B0058EBNAO|4.0|I really like this app a lot it has tons of info that you can taylor to your needs. I would have given it a 5 but it only lets you see wind direction in the hourly views. It is still accessable, but would be better if the wind speed were also listed in each column. The only other change I would make is to the radar map. It has poor detail of roads and counties, not unreadable but it could be better. Still, I highly recommend this app.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|It's the Beatles. What more do you have to say? Who else could produce an all-white album cover and sell three million copies? The music speaks for itself. The White Album is more than a memory. The USSR may be gone, but this music is still with us after more than forty years.<br /><br />The saying goes, \\"If you can remember the sixties, then you weren't there.\\" This is a self-referential quote. No one remembers who said it. According to Wikiquote, it is \\"Attributed to Grace Slick in Bangkok Babylon (2006) by Jerry Hopkins, p. 217, and elsewhere, this [quote] was also attributed to Paul Kantner in The New Yorker, Vol. 67 (1991), Dennis Hopper in Roger Ebert's Movie Home Companion (1992), and in various books to numerous others, including Judy Collins, George Harrison, and comedian Robin Williams.\\"

B005MMJ84K|5.0|I knew I should have waited until closer to Requiem's release date before starting this series... what a cliffhanger!<br /><br />I like that Pandemonium is more action packed and faster paced than Delirium. I'm not a fan of love triangles but I actually like this one. Julian seems like a nice boy but it almost feel a bit superficial for someone deprived of love to fall for the first person &#34;infected&#34; with amor deliria nervosa he meets, despite the situation they were put in. Alex, however, whole-heartedly chose Lena and would do anything for her. (Can you tell I'm for team Alex?) I have mix feelings for Lena. I'm glad she is more courageous in this book but how could she have moved on so quickly? I like Raven and Tack and hope to know more about them on the next book.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|In this 2006 film, Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an auditor who works for the Internal Revenue Service that has a very routine and mundane life. That is until one day when he hears the voice of a woman that seems to narrate his life and thoughts with perfect accuracy. His life slowly changes when he has to audit a baker, Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), to whom he is attracted to. Convinced that he seems to be a character in a story, he consults a literature professor, Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Little does he know, he is a character in the latest book being written by author Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who suffers from writer's block over Harold's eventual fate.<br /><br />Like many other reviewers on this website, I am not really a Will Ferrell fan. However, in this film he sheds his usual roles as a child in a grown man's body and shows himself as a very capable dramatic actor. The film manages to find a good cross between comedy and drama for a very satisfying experience. While at first the premise of real person being a character in a novel might seem silly, it really works in the film.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is very enjoyable film with a premise that ultimately works well and good performances by its cast.
0938045768|5.0|A very enjoyable read and a complete workout system. I've only taken bit's and pieces from convict conditioning to add to my own workout as i believe Paul's methods require alot of reps, alot of time and basically alot of patience.

B001974DG0|5.0|When I first read this book many years ago I was riveted from the very start. Growing up in California I had been to the canyons in the opening chapters where Travis first meets Einstein and many places in the book took me back to my childhood home that I loved. The more I read the more I got lost in the story.  Watchers is a story of love and devotion, of good versus evil.  I've read nearly every other Koontz book since picking up this one and I always come back to Watchers.  I'd highly recommend it but beware... You won't be able to put it down until you're done and then you'll be hungry for more!

B008220DIC|4.0|Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, The Master stars Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell, a World War II vet turned drifter suffering from sex and alcohol addictions - not to mention post-traumatic stress disorder.  Unable to adapt to society after the war, Freddie inadvertently crosses paths with Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), known as The Master.  Dodd is a founder of a moment, known as &#34;The Cause,&#34; an organization-like cult.  Dodd, the author of his own self-help book, claims he has the ability to cure people by putting in touch with the past via a type of hypnotic time travel - a process that Dodd's son even references as being made up.  Fascinated by the organization, Freddie attempts to adhere to their teachings, but finds himself unable to focus - often reminiscing about his ex-girlfriend, who said she'd wait for him prior to leaving for war.  Amy Adams, Laura Dern, Jesse Plemons and Rami Malek also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />The controversy surrounding The Master has been its comparison to Scientology.  However, writer Paul Thomas Anderson has made no admittance to that allegation, however, the seminaries and dates regarding the history of Scientology seem to match the plot pretty closely – even making one wonder whether the founder of Scientology is the basis for Philip Seymour Hoffman’s character.  Regardless, the film’s story is difficult to describe, often times hard to comprehend – certainly creating a film that’s completely different than anything else out there at the moment.  These elements create an engaging idea (plot wise), but once it’s over – you’ll have absolutely no desire to ever watch it again.  It’s good, but not great.  It’s horribly boring in spots, yet it’s hard to stop watching.  Obviously, the most bothersome part for most people will be the film’s slow-progressing, questionable direction – which doesn’t even give clean cut closure to the story.  It’s an absolutely absurd and perplexing tale, but it will leave you with a feeling of youth and invigoration.  If it sounds mind-blowing, you’re not wrong.  Themes of fatherhood, leadership, loyalty, and devotion are just a few of the resounding elements that will be left engrained in your mind once the credits role.<br /><br />There’s little doubt that this storyline provides an interesting take on one man’s psychological issues after coming back from war.  Joaquin Phoenix brings a sobering demonstration of post-traumatic stress to the screen.  He’s impeccably precise with his actions and brilliantly moving, often wearing his character’s emotions on his sleeve.  Pheonix’s performance was so close to perfection that you’d think it’s near impossible to upstage him in this role – but then there’s Philip Seymour Hoffman portraying the leader of this cult movement.  He brings a demanding style of leadership and devotion to the cause in this role.  His interactions with Pheonix bring out the best in both of them and it’s clearly evident that they just feed off one another – constantly making each other better with every passing scene.  Throw in Academy Award nominee Amy Adams and you’re filled with constant scenes of sheer enjoyment (to watch).  The only setback here is that we don’t delve into these character’s pasts – other than that of Phoenix.<br /><br />Overall, The Master is quite simply a brilliant film – so brilliant and thought-provoking (all be shockingly slow) that it will feel like a momentous occasion just to make it through the film.  The acting is masterful, but the plot itself lacks clarity, plot direction, and is just too smart for its own good.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  B+<br />FNDNreview.comand perplexing tale, but it will leave you with a feeling of youth and invigoration.

B008JFUMUQ|1.0|Bruce Willis returns to the Die Hard franchise in the fifth installment, A Good Day to Die Hard.  This time around, John McClane is off to Russia to give his son, Jack (Jai Courtney), more support as he awaits trial for carrying out an assassination.  Undercover for the CIA, Jack is secretly trying to rescue a political prisoner, Yuri (Sebastian Koch) – who is supposedly in possession of a file (hold incriminating evidence) to put a corrupt Russian official, Chagarin (Sergei Kolesnikov), behind bars.  However, when Jack comes face to face with his father, he couldn’t be any less happier to see him.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead also returns to the series as McClane’s daughter, Lucy.<br /><br />Oh, where to begin with this mess of a film…  Unlike the previous sequels in the Die Hard franchise, this newest addition is a complete and utter disaster from beginning to end, serving no other purpose than to shoot guns, create explosions, and have a ridiculous car chase.  From pitiful, shaky camera work to forced dialogue with poor one-liners, this film is easily the worst in the franchise.  It’s not very often that poor editing is comparable to Michael Bay’s Armageddon, but this newest Die Hard certainly brings up those bad memories of too many cut scenes messed together, which easily creates the potential for a very bad headache.  And, if the constant cut scenes don’t do it, then there’s a good chance having to read a fair amount of subtitles will make it happen.<br /><br />As usual, there’s no need to focus too much on the acting in an action film of this nature.  In fact, if Bruce Willis had a stuntman even remotely resembling his face, there’d be no need for Bruce to be on set at all.  This film features so little dialogue from Willis that it will almost make you wonder how many millions he makes per word.  To be fair, it’s really difficult to add smart dialogue into a film that fills most of its gaps with bullets and grenade blasts.  However, in true Willis fashion, he does roll out a few humorous one-liners that will create a brief chuckle – most of which happen during those stressful, dire situations where your average person would no doubt be in the middle of a panic attack or searching for the nearest escape route.<br /><br />The absolute biggest problem with the film is the lack of a serious, credible villain.  Looking back at the rest of the Die Hard films, we are blessed with Alan Rickman, William Sadler, Jeremy Irons, and Timothy Olyphant – yet in this film we get some random Russian (without any real backstory) that, in the end, tries (poorly) to be Jack’s version of Hans Gruber.  Obviously, this shouldn’t be too much of a spoiler since it’s unrealistic to believe the villain doesn’t get what’s coming to him by the time the credits role.  Never the less, the need for a more melicious villain is at the top of the list on the long list of complaints regarding this fifth installment.  Perhaps more time should have been spent establishing a dramatic plot – as in the previous films – and this might have been a more enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Lastly, it should be noted that the ending of this film raises a great many questions about the franchise’s future.  Jai Courtney is a relatively unknown actor (as was Willis at one time), so it’s possible the reigns might be in the process of being handed over to him.  It’s a logical conclusion since Jack McClane’s real name is purposely stated in the film as being “John McClane Jr.”  Of course, it’s too early to say whether or not this will be the final film in the franchise, but in the event that it is – this is really not the way you’ll want to see John McClane go out.  Here’s hoping for one more ride, and a far better send off.<br /><br />Overall Grade:  D+<br />[...]he does roll out a few humorous one-liners that will create a brief chuckle – most of which happen during those stressful, dire situations where your average person would no doubt be in the middle of a panic attack or searching for the nearest escape route.

B009AMAGXK|3.0|Typically, reviews begin with some kind of introduction that relates to the film being reviewed.  However, in this particular case, the film being reviewed happens to be about two families, each with teens in high school that happen to have an immediate attraction to one another - only to find one of those teens happens to be incredibly strange.  The two teens are able to move past the oddity and happen to fall in love with one another.  The problem is one of those strange individuals happens to have super powers, while the other just happens to be a mere mortal with an uncontrollable love attraction, creating a complex situation where it would simply be better off for everyone (in their small town community) if the two teens just stayed away from one another.  But, if they just stayed away from each other, there's really no reason to watch the movie - or read the book.  Does all of this HAPPEN to sound familiar?  If not, watch the Twilight Saga, and then come straight back here and finish reading this review about a completely relatable, yet unrelated film, Beautiful Creatures.<br /><br />Beautiful Creatures, based on the 2009 novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, stars Alice Englert as Lena Duchannes, a mysterious young girl that just moved into the small town of Gatllin, South Carolina - a traditional southern community that prides itself around the Battle of Honey Hill, during Sherman's March to the Sea in the American Civil War.  In school, Lena meets Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich), a popular boy who has been having dreams about a faceless, mysterious girl - which turns out to be Lena.  Ethan instantly befriends her and discovers a number of abnormalities about Lena, her uncle Macon (Jeremy Irons), and Lena's cousin, Ridley (Emmy Rossum) - all of whom process the power of sorcery (witchcraft).  Upon her 16th birthday (which is rapidly approaching), Lena's true nature will consumer her and reveal her true self as either belonging to side of the light side or the dark.  After discovering both her mother (Emma Thompson) and her previously close cousin, Ridley, succumbed to the darkness (and are trying to turn her to the dark), Lena and Ethan do all they can to make sure she stays in the light.<br /><br />For a story about love and family - not to mention overused supernatural powers, the film is quite charming and enjoyable.  Obviously, this isn't the time or place to compare the differences between the film and novel, other than to say there are several differences.  Regardless, this film adaption has the potential to relate to a wide-variety of people, other than the young adults and that book readers that it's targeting.  The main theme revolve around true love and what two people will do for one another in order to be together.  The film also features a theme about the importance of family - no matter how evil or how twisted they appear to be.  When all of Lena's family members sit down for dinner, it's impeccably close to the ridiculousness of The Addams Family.  At the same time, it's incredibly ease to say, \\"Wow, this really is the family from Hell.\\"  Jeremy Irons' character fits in well here in the role of the father figure.  His presence is nothing short of superb, and he really does \\"take one for the team\\" - you'll understand when you see it.  As this Liam Neeson-like father role, Irons' is the one trying to hold everything together, while the evil outside spirit (Lena's mother), tries to tear it all apart and destroy the newly in love couple.  Emmy Rossum is the flip-side of that coin, playing the evil seductress that stirs the family pot, causing nothing but havoc.<br /><br />In all honesty, if you gave Lena a magic wand, you could easily call her Harry Potter, not to mention it would also be incredibly easy to sit here and compare/contrast Beautiful Creatures to Twilight - but there's really no need to mention anything more about Twilight other than to say Beautiful Creatures does a better job of telling thisstory than Twilight.  The acting is far superior and the chemistry between Ehrenreich and Duchannes simply flows well together, and it's surprisingly believable that these two characters were preordained to find one another.  Unfortunately, the overshadowing issue holding this film back, stopping it from being the next Romeo and Juliet love story is the fact that it's simply a clich&eacute;-filled reproduction - with witchcraft, instead of Shakespearean dialogue or the use of vampires/werewolves/magic wands.<br /><br />Overall, Beautiful Creatures is sadly meant to cater only to readers of the novel and young adults.  Disappointingly, this novel's popularity doesn't even come close to matching the readership of Twilight or Harry Potter, leaving the margin for success to be rather slim.  At the moment, Beautiful Creatures is just the first film/adaption in a new series of young adult novels (and film series - depending on box office performance) - but for now, the sequels have yet to be published, so it's difficult to say when we or if we will ever see these characters again.  Until then, feel free to enjoy these characters and watch with confidence.<br /><br />Overall Grade:  C+story than Twilight.

It's one of those unwritten rules of criticism to refrain yourself from speaking in the first person.  However, this is a special case - especially since we are talking about &#34;The Great One.&#34;  He is the most electrifying man in all of entertainment.  He is &#34;The Rock.&#34;  Of course, I'm referring to Dwayne Johnson, the current part-time superstar in the WWE turned Hollywood action star.  Now, I say action star because the majority of his roles are in films where he's just kicking ass.  There's no other way to describe it.  He goes out there and lays the smack down.  From his first role in The Mummy Returns, all the way to the present, Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson began as a simple, mediocre actor with a stunning physique and escalated to quite the leading man in Hollywood - who's now just ridiculously ripped.  Seriously, the guy is literally the size of a tank and not only that, he proves in his newest film, Snitch - he's not just all muscle.<br /><br />In Snitch, Dwayne Johnson stars as John Matthews, a trucking distribution owner that agrees to work with the federal government to be an informant after his son, Jason (Rafi Garvron), is sent to prison for the intent to distribute narcotics.  After striking a deal with the DEA, Matthews (undercover) partners with one of his employees, Daniel (Jon Bernthal), an ex-convict with connections to the drug world.  Barry Pepper, Michael Kenneth Williams, Nadine Velazquez, Benjamin Bratt, and Susan Sarandon round out this star-filled cast.<br /><br />Now keep in mind, Dwayne Johnson has been one of my favorite athletes since the first time he won the Intercontinental championship - so I'm pretty biased here.  Regardless, to see The Rock come full circle from a young WWE superstar through this role in Snitch is an absolute accomplishment for him, and it's incredibly exciting for all of his millions and millions of fans.  Without question, this is by far the best acting performance from Johnson to date.  He's certainly no Kevin Costner, but he's getting better and better with each passing role.  For once, it's nice to see Johnson go a whole movie without getting into a overpowering physical confrontation of any kind - meaning it's nice to see a film where he isn't giving bad guys &#34;the rock bottom.&#34;  In this film, he's actually given a chance to show off his dramatic side, as opposed to the constant wave of brute force.  There's never been any doubt that Johnson is filled with charisma, but if you add this less than disarming dramatic side to his resume, it creates even more possibilities for his future roles.<br /><br />Part of what makes Dwayne Johnson so successful in this role is the cast he has around him.  Most notably, Barry Pepper continues to excell in the majority of his roles - with this role being no exception.  He brings a seriousness to the reality the situation in this role, a trait that is relatively lacking from Johnson's character.And, who doesn't want Susan Sarandon as a cast-mate?  Her effortless intuitions take a seemingly boring character and turns her into one of the key components of the plot.  It makes absolute sense for her to play a prosecutor running for Congress - and though her character is a bit &#34;catty,&#34; she'd still take in a boatload of votes.<br /><br />This script essentially sends a watered-down message to viewers that if one of your family members does enough for the government, the government instantly let someone out of jail.  Obviously, the &#34;deal&#34; wouldn't apply to all crimes, but the underlying principal is the same - that being the government is somehow flexible just because your loved one is in prison.  While that premise is indeed comical at times, it still makes for interesting entertainment.  On paper, the premise of this film seems a bit tacky (even if it was a true story), but the acting execution is clearly the driving force behind the success of this picture.  Drug cartels are no stranger to film storylines, but this one stands out - not because of its story - but because of the emotionally-driven devotion to family and thematic message regarding what one father will do for his son.<br /><br />In the end, this movie had my attention simply because The Rock was in the staring role.  It's a complete bonus to get a fast-paced, entertaining film with a well-rounded cast on top of him in the staring role.  In any event, you will absolutely - without question - get your money's worth out of this film.  Two hours will seem like 20 minutes.

At the same time, it’s still so very hard to find a good horror film that doesn’t contain endless amounts of CGI-based weird looking aliens – as if we really need any more renditions of what extra-terrestrials may or may not look like.  In all honesty, aliens should just come to earth (briefly) if for nothing else than to give filmmakers their correct form – so at least there’s some consistency about who’s going to blow up the White House next or destroy Japan and China in all of the future sci-fi film.  Without fail, every couple of weeks there’s a new alien flick that has people randomly being experimented on or pointlessly shows the destruction of the Washington Monument.  You would think by now people would have grown tired of aliens running rampant on humanity – but they are again, constantly having their way with the big screen.  This week’s alien flick is Dark Skies.<br /><br />Written and directed by Scott Stewart, Dark Skies stars Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton as Lacy and Daniel Barrett (respectively), a typical married couple with two sons, Jesse (Dakota Goyo) and Sam (Kadan Rockett).  After a series of abnormal occurrences at home (while the family is sleeping), paranoia grows amongst Daniel and Lacy when they start to believe intruders may be entering the house, eventually finding a connection between their son, Sam, and his bad dreams.  Sam claims the “sandman” enters his dreams and causes him to do things he doesn’t want to do, but as time progresses, the entire family soon starts experiencing similar unexplainable events, including unaccountable time gaps, abusive marks to their body, and random ringing in their ears.  J.K. Simmons also stars in a supporting role as Edwin Pollard, a conspiracy theorist that has previously dealt with these occurrences.<br /><br />When this film begins, the very first thing you’ll see is the Dimension Films logo – and in case you are unaware of that particular meaning, it should instantly tapper your expectations.  In the past, Dimension Films has been responsible for some of the worst films to grace the big screen – films such as the Halloween sequels, basically anything Wes Craven has ever done, and a slew of cult favorites – like Sin City, Scary Movie, and The Crow.  However – and surprisingly, Dark Skies is an entertaining experience, especially since it initially had the potential to be a complete bust.  After watching countless films with a wide variety of alien encounters, Signs - the 2002 sci-fi thriller starring Mel Gibson – immediately comes to mind as a comparison for Dark Skies.  Both feature plots about aliens invading the earth and hitting a family at the core in a very real way, while the majority of the plot takes place in the family’s houses.  The aliens themselves are also comparable in both of these films, with Signs featuring a much more corporeal creature and Dark Skies featuring ghost-like creatures.<br /><br />The majority of the scenes in this film are dominated by Keri Russell and Josh Hamilton – the married couple struggling to pay their bills while assuming the job of protecting their sons from super natural, alien creatures.  Their on-screen presence is another unexpected surprise in the film – featuring a decent amount of dramatic scenes in which it’s completely believable that they’re a struggling married couple.  Some scenes are better than others as far as the suspense goes, and for those of us that don’t enjoy the scenes that make you jump, this film will be tolerable, borderline enjoyable to you.  The hardcore sci-fi/horror buffs will find this to be another tedious disappointment that never meets the mark.  Also, there's a historically memorable scene involving a few flock of birds that will be reminesant of Hitchcock's suspense thriller, The Birds.<br /><br />Overall, Dark Skies is a cliché driven film, yet it makes for a great date night experience – with just the right amount of scary.  If there were any more “jump out” scenes, the film may have you thinking about nonchalantly taking a bathroom break or twisting your date’s arm to let you go buy them some popcorn.  But - rest assured, you’ll survive this one to tell the tale.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  B<br />Date Night Worthy:  B+<br /><br />•  Release Date – 2/22/13<br />•  Written & Directed by Scott Stewart<br />•  Starring – Keri Russell, Josh Hamilton, & J.K.

Gangster films, horror flicks, superheroes, teen comedies, etc.  Films come in in waves, mostly dealing with the same subject matter - only different characters with different interactions.  Once again, mental illness has become so interesting that filmmakers are re-delving into the world of the psyche.  Previous films, like Rain Man, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Psycho are just a fraction of the titles that have dealt with stories surrounding characters that were mentally ill.  Recently, that trend has rematerialized in films, like Silver Linings Playbook, Side Effects, and Paul Thomas Anderson's newest creation:  The Master.<br /><br />Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, The Master stars Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell, a World War II vet turned drifter suffering from sex and alcohol addictions - not to mention post-traumatic stress disorder.  Unable to adapt tosociety after the war, Freddie inadvertently crosses paths with Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), known as The Master.  Dodd is a founder of a moment, known as &#34;The Cause,&#34; an organization-like cult.  Dodd, the author of his own self-help book, claims he has the ability to cure people by putting in touch with the past via a type of hypnotic time travel - a process that Dodd's son even references as being made up.  Fascinated by the organization, Freddie attempts to adhere to their teachings, but finds himself unable to focus - often reminiscing about his ex-girlfriend, who said she'd wait for him prior to leaving for war.  Amy Adams, Laura Dern, Jesse Plemons and Rami Malek also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />The controversy surrounding The Master has been its comparison to Scientology.  However, writer Paul Thomas Anderson has made no admittance to that allegation, however, the seminaries and dates regarding the history of Scientology seem to match the plot pretty closely – even making one wonder whether the founder of Scientology is the basis for Philip Seymour Hoffman’s character.  Regardless, the film’s story is difficult to describe, often times hard to comprehend – certainly creating a film that’s completely different than anything else out there at the moment.  These elements create an engaging idea (plot wise), but once it’s over – you’ll have absolutely no desire to ever watch it again.  It’s good, but not great.  It’s horribly boring in spots, yet it’s hard to stop watching.  Obviously, the most bothersome part for most people will be the film’s slow-progressing, questionable direction – which doesn’t even give clean cut closure to the story.  It’s an absolutely absurd and perplexing tale, but it will leave you with a feeling of youth and invigoration.  If it sounds mind-blowing, you’re not wrong.  Themes of fatherhood, leadership, loyalty, and devotion are just a few of the resounding elements that willbe left engrained in your mind once the credits role.<br /><br />There’s little doubt that this storyline provides an interesting take on one man’s psychological issues after coming back from war.  Joaquin Phoenix brings a sobering demonstration of post-traumatic stress to the screen.  He’s impeccably precise with his actions and brilliantly moving, often wearing his character’s emotions on his sleeve.  Pheonix’s performance was so close to perfection that you’d think it’s near impossible to upstage him in this role – but then there’s Philip Seymour Hoffman portraying the leader of this cult movement.  He brings a demanding style of leadership and devotion to the cause in this role.  His interactions with Pheonix bring out the best in both of them and it’s clearly evident that they just feed off one another – constantly making each other better with every passing scene.  Throw in Academy Award nominee Amy Adams and you’re filled with constant scenes of sheer enjoyment (to watch).  The only setback here is that we don’t delve into these character’s pasts – other than that of Phoenix.<br /><br />Overall, The Master is quite simply a brilliant film – so brilliant and thought-provoking (all be shockingly slow) that it will feel like a momentous occasion just to make it through the film.  The acting is masterful, but the plot itself lacks clarity, plot direction, and is just too smart for its own good.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  B+<br />Date Night Worthy:  D-<br /><br />  Release Date – 9/14/13<br />  Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson<br />  Starring – Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams<br />  Genre – Drama<br />  Running Time – 144 Minutes<br />  Rated R for Sexual content, Graphic Nudity and Language<br /><br />Add Comment<br /><br />'Safe Haven' another poor, generic romance<br /><br />02/18/2013<br /><br />0 Comments<br /><br />Picture<br />by: Matt Lee<br />  -<br />Ah, the dramatic romance genre – if one were forced to honestly define “dramatic romance” in film, it would most probably go something like: a style of movie telling on life support better suited for novels and Lifetime television instead of the big screen.  And, more than likely, the main picture in the dictionary next to the definition would be of romance author, Nicholas Sparks.  Ask a man if he’s seen a Nicholas Sparks film, and he might begrudgingly say “yes,” followed by “my girlfriend/wife made me watch it,” but if you ask a woman, odds are at least one of Sparks’ films (adapted from his novels) is on her list of favorite movies to watch.  Perhaps that’s generalizing, yet it doesn’t make it any less true.  Nicolas Sparks writes romantic novels, which cater to women, and typically feature a happy ending (tears are optional) – not to mention 2013 isn’t the first year that one of Sparks’ novels was adapted to film and released for Valentine’s Day.  In the past, Message in a Bottle, A Walk to Remember, Dear John, along with the newest release, Safe Haven – have all been timely released for this “Hallmark” holiday.<br /><br />Safe Haven, originally a novel written by Nicolas Sparks and released in 2010 under the same name, focuses on Katie (Julianne Hough), the shy, beautiful out-of-towner seeking a small, secluded town where she can hide from her dark, mysterious past.  Immediately, she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), the townie convenient store owner (with two kids and a recently deceased wife), and Jo (Cobie Smulders), her new neighbor from down the street.  After making several trips to the convenient store, Katie bonds with Alex’s six year old daughter, Lexie (Mimi Kirkland) – ultimately leading to Alex and Katie spending more time together.  The sparks fly, but it turns out Katie isn’t being totally honest with Alex – keeping her abusive husband (David Lyons) that’s searching for her from him.  Cue the drama...<br /><br />Apparently, Hitchcock-style twists and turns are all the rage these days, with Safe Haven being no exception.  While you may initially think this could potentially be the next Notebook, or at least an average love story – it’s going to disappoint you as it turns out to be so much more, and so much worse.  The acting, the scenery, the cast, the plot – it’s all overshadowed by the bizarre ending of the film.  The ending depreciates the film so much so that it basically forces you to shake your head, even though you might already be tearing up at the same time.  Yes, it’s really that mind-boggling and bewildering.<br /><br />Without a doubt, it would be incredibly easy to just trash this film due largely in part to the ending, except for the fact that this film was mildly tolerable until the climactic twist.  Let’s face facts here – Julianne Hough is known for her outstanding voice and dancing ability, while Josh Duhamel looks pretty out of place unless he has a gun in his hand, firing at space aliens made out of automobiles.  Obviously, these aren’t your typical star-powered actors and actresses – rather models that act.  There’s very little doubt that these two individuals are stunningly gorgeous as eye candy, but the overall quality of the film is sacrificed because of their limited acting ability.  Midway through the film, it’s a head-scratcher as to why Cobie Smulders is even in the film, since she has little to do with the plot until the very end of the film.  If this cast was anymore unmemorable and expendable, this film will be a perfect fit as a Lifetime original.  Never the less, this is still a Nicolas Sparks story, so it’s instantly going to garner a certain amount of attention, not to mention a healthy box office gross.<br /><br />Overall, this film is terribly generic and to call it anything less is irresponsible.  However, it’s not so bad that it shouldn’t be recommended to the film-goers it was created for – that being women.  Will the film bore guys todeath with its lack of substance and slow-moving plot?  Yes, very much so – yet it’s ironic that the film’s only saving grace is also the same element that dooms the film:  Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  D-<br />Date Night Worthy:  C-<br /><br />  Release Date – 2/14/13<br />  Directed by Lasse Hallström<br />  Screenplay by Gage Lansky and Dana Stevens (film), Nicholas Sparks (novel)<br />  Starring – Julianne Hough, Josh Duhamel, David Lyons, and Cobie Smulders<br />  Genre – Romantic Drama<br />  Running Time – 115 Minutes Rated PG-13 for Violence, Sexuality, and Threatening Behavior<br /><br />Add Comment<br /><br />'Beautiful Creatures' a complex family affair<br /><br />02/16/2013<br /><br />0 Comments<br /><br />Picture<br />by:  Matt Lee<br />  -<br />Typically, reviews begin with some kind of introduction that relates to the film being reviewed.  However, in this particular case, the film being reviewed happens to be about two families, each with teens in high school that happen to have an immediate attraction to one another – only to find one of those teens happens to be incredibly strange.  The two teens are able to move past the oddity and happen to fall in love with one another.  The problem is one of those strange individuals happens to have super powers, while the other just happens to be a mere mortal with an un-controlling love attraction, creating a complex situation where it would simply be better off for everyone (in their small town community) if the two teens just stayed away from one another.  But, if they just stayed away from each other, there’s really no reason to watch the movie – or read the book.  Does all of this HAPPEN to sound familiar?  If not, watch the Twilight Saga, and then come straight back here and finish reading this review about a completely relatable, yet unrelated film, Beautiful Creatures.<br /><br />Beautiful Creatures, based on the 2009 novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, stars Alice Englert as Lena Duchannes, a mysterious young girl that just moved into the small town of Gatllin, South Carolina – a traditional southern community that prides itself around the Battle of Honey Hill, during Sherman’s March to the Sea in the American Civil War.  In school, Lena meets Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich), a popular boy who has been having dreams about a faceless, mysterious girl – which turns out to be Lena.  Ethan instantly befriends her and discovers a number of abnormalities about Lena, her uncle Macon (Jeremy Irons), and Lena’s cousin, Ridley (Emmy Rossum) – all of whom process the power of sorcery (witchcraft).  Upon her 16th birthday (which is rapidly approaching), Lena’s true nature will consumer her and reveal her true self as either belonging to side of the light side or the dark.  After discovering both her mother (Emma Thompson) and her previously close cousin, Ridley, succumbed to the darkness (and are trying to turn her to the dark), Lena and Ethan do all they can to make sure she stays in the light.<br /><br />For a story about love and family – not to mention overused supernatural powers, the film is quite charming and enjoyable.  Obviously, this isn’t the time or place to compare the differences between the film and novel, other than to say there are several differences.  Regardless, this film adaption has the potential to relate to a wide-variety of people, other than the young adults and that book readers that it’s targeting.  The main theme revolve around true love and what two people will do for one another in order to be together.  The film also features a theme about the importance of family – no matter how evil or how twisted they appear to be.  When all of Lena’s family members sit down for dinner, it’s impeccably close to the rediculousness of The Addams Family.  At the same time, it’s incredibly ease to say, “Wow, this really is the family from Hell.”  Jeremy Irons’ characterfits in well here in the role of the father figure.  His presence is nothing short of superb, and he really does “take one for the team” – you’ll understand when you see it.  As this Liam Neeson-like father role, Irons’ is the one trying to hold everything together, while the evil outside spirit (Lena’s mother), tries to tear it all apart and destroy the newly in love couple.  Emmy Rossum is the flip-side of that coin, playing the evil seductress that stirs the family pot, causing nothing
B001BWQWKS|5.0|This disc, recorded with precision and with good internal balance in 2008, by bringing together three loosely related works makes an ideal and generous coupling. The link between the three works is that in 1903, Faure's class, which included Ravel, decided to mark the tenth anniversary of Debussy's quartet by writing a collaborative work. In the event the composition turned out to be Ravel's quartet which showed in its similarities of form, Ravel's admiration of the earlier quartet by Debussy. The musical language was, of course quite different and earned Debussy's encouragement not to change anything about the work upon its completion.<br /><br />All three quartets are the only string quartets written by each of these composers. That of Faure was written at the end of his life and was not completed until 1924. As such it was the last of the three works to be written and Faure died before hearing it performed. The quartets by both Debussy and Ravel were written when the two men were still young and share a young man's energy and that energy is clearly in evidence in these immaculately played performances. The Debussy quartet dates from 1893 and the Ravel from 1903. Both of these latter two share similarities of form with a pizzicato second movement being the most distinctive similarity and it is this movement that is a good indicator of the Ebene's style of playing these three works.<br /><br />The Ebene bring a remarkably clear-cut approach to these three works. All of this can be heard with ease in these two pizzicato movements. Every detail is clearly exposed for our attention. The pizzicati themselves are played with a striking precision, unanimity and power. Every hairpin accent is observed and underlined. So too with every change in tempi or dynamics. This is technically very accurate and, in its way, very subtle playing. At the same time there is not the emotional warmth of many of the established interpretations heard from the last few decades. The recording, in its very clear and precise way, makes the ideal partner to these performances. In these ways this disc is very much a product of its time and, as such, is a very fine example of modern playing at its impressive best.<br /><br />This therefore, is playing very much to admire and it certainly has received numerous golden opinions from critics to whom I would add my own. However, I am not so sure that this is a performance that I will grow to love, and here is the difference between admiration and love. The latter requires an emotional response and the former is a cooler assessment. There are several versions of these works in my collection that I have grown to love over the years, often recorded within a complementary warmer acoustic, and so far the Ebene Quartet performances have not joined them in that way. This may yet occur. My immediate comparisons have been made with discs made by the Italian, Melos, Hagen and Belcea Quartets.<br /><br />I would suggest that this disc deserves the considerable praise that has been lavished upon it. As such it certainly deserves to be seriously considered by anyone tempted by the program. I am not so sure that it is the definitive version that has been suggested however as there is room for more emotionally generous views too, and by that I do not wish to imply emotion at the expense of accuracy. As the heading to this review states, this is a very clear, clean and modern set with every detail exposed to be heard and appreciated and as such it certainly succeeds in every detail., in its very clear and precise way, makes the ideal partner to these performances. In these ways this disc is very much a product of its time and, as such, is a very fine example of modern playing at its impressive best.<br /><br />This therefore, is playing very much to admire and it certainly has received numerous golden opinions from critics to whom I would add my own. However, I am not so sure that this is a performance that I will grow to love, and here is the difference between admiration and love. The latter requires an emotional response and the former is a cooler assessment. There are several versions of these works in my collection that I have grown to love over the years, often recorded within a complementary warmer acoustic, and so far the Ebene Quartet performances have not joined them in that way. This may yet occur. My immediate comparisons have been made with discs made by the Italian, Melos, Hagen and Belcea Quartets.<br /><br />I would suggest that this disc deserves the considerable praise that has been lavished upon it. As such it certainly deserves to be seriously considered by anyone tempted by the program.

B005LAIHU4|1.0|Safe Haven, originally a novel written by Nicolas Sparks and released in 2010 under the same name, focuses on Katie (Julianne Hough), the shy, beautiful out-of-towner seeking a small, secluded town where she can hide from her dark, mysterious past.  Immediately, she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), the townie convenient store owner (with two kids and a recently deceased wife), and Jo (Cobie Smulders), her new neighbor from down the street.  After making several trips to the convenient store, Katie bonds with Alex’s six year old daughter, Lexie (Mimi Kirkland) – ultimately leading to Alex and Katie spending more time together.  The sparks fly, but it turns out Katie isn’t being totally honest with Alex – keeping her abusive husband (David Lyons) that’s searching for her from him.  Cue the drama...<br /><br />Apparently, Hitchcock-style twists and turns are all the rage these days, with Safe Haven being no exception.  While you may initially think this could potentially be the next Notebook, or at least an average love story – it’s going to disappoint you as it turns out to be so much more, and so much worse.  The acting, the scenery, the cast, the plot – it’s all overshadowed by the bizarre ending of the film.  The ending depreciates the film so much so that it basically forces you to shake your head, even though you might already be tearing up at the same time.  Yes, it’s really that mind-boggling and bewildering.<br /><br />Without a doubt, it would be incredibly easy to just trash this film due largely in part to the ending, except for the fact that this film was mildly tolerable until the climactic twist.  Let’s face facts here – Julianne Hough is known for her outstanding voice and dancing ability, while Josh Duhamel looks pretty out of place unless he has a gun in his hand, firing at space aliens made out of automobiles.  Obviously, these aren’t your typical star-powered actors and actresses – rather models that act.  There’s very little doubt that these two individuals are stunningly gorgeous as eye candy, but the overall quality of the film is sacrificed because of their limited acting ability.  Midway through the film, it’s a head-scratcher as to why Cobie Smulders is even in the film, since she has little to do with the plot until the very end of the film.  If this cast was anymore unmemorable and expendable, this film will be a perfect fit as a Lifetime original.  Never the less, this is still a Nicolas Sparks story, so it’s instantly going to garner a certain amount of attention, not to mention a healthy box office gross.<br /><br />Overall, this film is terribly generic and to call it anything less is irresponsible.  However, it’s not so bad that it shouldn’t be recommended to the film-goers it was created for – that being women.  Will the film bore guys to death with its lack of substance and slow-moving plot?  Yes, very much so – yet it’s ironic that the film’s only saving grace is also the same element that dooms the film:  Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  D-<br />FNDNreview.comdoubt that these two individuals are stunningly gorgeous as eye candy, but the overall quality of the film is sacrificed because of their limited acting ability.

B000002UVA|5.0|One of the few metal bands I could stomach listening to in the 90's. This is not alternative rock like Pearl Jam or Soundgarden(thank GOD!) or grunge(worthless stuff that is the worst music ever made) or &#34;buzz(more worthless, no talent utter nonsense)&#34;. This sounds more like a band from the 80's that was not glam or top 40 but rather more along the lines of something harder, inotherwards more like actual metal. Although not as hard rock as say Manowar, this is one of the few bands from the 90's that a true rock/metal fan can actually listen to without wanting to shut it off.
B009YQJ322|5.0|Loved everything about this movie. Solid lead actors. Great action. Nice effects.<br /><br />Probably closer to our true future than we'd care to realize.<br /><br />Nuff said.
B000002KKY|5.0|Saling, Ride Like the Wind, and many more are included in this collection. Soft rock at it's finest is how to describe this album. After listening to Manowar or Metallica, I like to listen to Chris Cross(not the hip hop child band) to &#34;bring me back down&#34;, so to speak. Easy listening/soft rock at it's definitive best. Enjoy!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a very good app &amp; very reliable! It's free &amp; has no bugs &amp; stays current with updates. Highly recommend.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|This one is unique!  It has attractive graphics, calming music and interesting gameplay.  My 4 year old daughter and I are both enjoying this game.  Fun for all ages!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app. it is my alarm for everything. I love the fact that I can change the alarm tone to sounds other than the typical alarm noise.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|What I read was depressing so I gave up.  Will go back to it later. So far I would not recommend it.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Poltergeist has been and always will be my favorite scary movie!!! Craig T Nelson was awesome JoBeth Williams was awesome the whole cast just worked!!! Little Heather sure would've went far in the movies she was great at five years old
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I've been wanting to play this game ever since I heard about this years ago. When I found out it was on the kindle I jumped at the chance to download this! This is a great physics based game. Even my 4 year old son loves playing this game. I found a lot of the levels challenging for me, however my 6 year old daughter was able to beat one level in her first try! Beginners luck :)  This is still a great game for everyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Makes . Me feel like a kid at heart again!!!  This game reminds me of the games I used to play when I was younger.
B003VA3JUO|3.0|That fact, however, does not mean that the story that develops before the reader/viewer does not have to be compelling, or moving.  I found [and this is simply my interpretation] this film moving forward from one scene to the next, and yet not be going anywhere. The actors themselves seem to be making this film by 'remote control'...they somehow appear to be detached from the events which are transpiring around them.  The special effects and different scenes are quite good, but the story line itself seems fuzzy and hard to understand.  I repeatedly found myself asking, \\"Why is this happening; what's going on?\\"<br />I've viewed many films in every category imaginable, but this one strikes me as neither memorable, nor particularly inspiring/frightening/moving. It is not emotionally captivating.  Sorry.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This season is awesome, didn't like the ending & will not spoil it for others, &#34;BUT PLEASE DON'T KILL OFF ANY OTHER CHARACTERS&#34;!!!
B0062NAX1U|2.0|Saw this on a bus in Peru yesterday. Excellent moral lessons whose truths are not found exclusively in \\"scripture.\\"<br />One does not need to be a Christian or Bible reader to be a moral, responsible person. Have a look at \\"The God Who Wasn't There.\\"
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a pretty entertaining game. It can be a little slow or glitchy at times, but overall a really good game. Nice job Gameloft.
B0091REZMW|3.0|so far its good haven't had any problems yet.hope it stays this way haven't got that fat so. there's room for disappointment
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is my sons favorite book and I finally downloaded it and wow I did not expect to be so excited about a book. I actually could not put it down and weeks later I still think about it! I wont give away the total surprises that are so amazing.....good stuff....
0805091742|5.0|The author walks us thru just how fallible the human mind really is, and how a simple checklist can make up for that fallibility.  For even the most basic and repetitive of tasks we often leave out critical parts.  This is fine when we are doing laundry and forget to add the fabric softener, but Atul walks us thru what happens when a Dr. forgets a step with a heart attack patient, or when a pilot has 300 people on a plane.  This is where the checklist comes in, and where lives can be saved.  This book is really a primer for any business too.  From a process for closing down a store, to an accounting department closing out the books for the month, there are so many steps that can be forgotten, but a simple checklist can correct.  I recommend this book for any business manager, and as Atul makes clear, anyone in the medical profession.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|The book. Would of been much better with a different ending!  Love the book until I got to the very end!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|enjoy the game and the different levels of difficulty.  Great game and its free.<br />Its always interesting. Colors are vivid.
B001B6PBBK|3.0|It's an okay movie. Very light.  Not remarkable or memorable, just cute.  If you're looking for a fluff piece, try this one.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game is as fun and interesting to play as it is gorgeous to look at.  I just discovered Big Fish games and am busy downloading as many as I can!  Highly recommend it!
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|If you like action starts than your favorites are probably in this movie.  It would be easier to list who isn't in this action DVD than who is and it is even better then the first Expendables.  Better script and action with all your favorites using some of their classing lines. Even if you have not seen the first one, which would be hard to believe, then you have to see this movie.  All your favorites doing what we love them doing best.  Some very clever and funny dialog!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is fun for old and young alike!  Warning!  This can be adictive!  Your kids will love this one for sure.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I have always been a Jeremy Renner fan and he makes a great Bourne!  I'm glad to see he was the one to take over Bourne as he has become a great action hero with several great movies under his belt like American Justice League and Ghost Protocol.  A real treat is watching his show The Unusuals to see how versatile an actor he can be.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Read it in 2 days.  couldn't put it down.  Really unexpected ending.  Highly recommend this book.  I will look for more books by this author.
B005Q4CM0Q|4.0|so good to watch an enjoyable movie full of action, fun, a touch of glamour, including the spangled banners etc. thoroughly entertaining without too much blood and bone focus. a nice lead into the rest of the &#34;marvel team&#34;
B009FZFONO|5.0|The drama and suspense in each episode keep you on the edge of your seat, before you know it the episode, and your wait till next one comes out.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this second of the hunger games series. It was very fast moving and exciting till the end. The one thing I don't like also with the first book is the abrupt ending. I hope the final book ends better. I wasn't able to read catching fire immediately after the hunger games and I won't be reading mocking Jay right away either so it leaves me hanging until I can get to it again.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Strange style of writing.But it was interesting once you realised what was happening.The ending was disappointing but I guess it fit the tale
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I started reading this series because I wanted to read the books before I saw the movie. The characters are well written and the story flows along at a quick pace. I found the book hard to put down and thoroughly enjoyed it... Now in to book 3!
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter who used to watch it all the time with her cousins before we moved away. She watches it multiple times a day and sings every song. It definitely has catchy tunes in the movie. I love this movie myself its a classic!
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|Love this album, It matches the game so well. Unlike some games on the market today.<br />Plus it's great to just to just listen to on the go.<br />The Strategy guide also helps with the game if your a completionist.
B00AAQWJCG|5.0|this recording is just pure music ... to me it is like a fusion of Jazz and rock  with a little big band in there for depth ... the only real lyrics are on willie the pimp and they are short lived in the open of this most amazing song and then it rolls into some of the best classic Frank Zappa guitar Jam... sugarcane Harris really rips on the violin at the open .... i first bought the album in  i think 1973 when i was in the 7th grade... most of my friends didnt get it, but, still i love this Album it is my top of the top three FZ albums Hot rats, Waka Jawaka, and the Grand Wazzoo... they are definitely related in style, and still on my must have list after 40 years.<br />  I am so glad Amazon Finally has them available for MP3 download
B009YP9L7U|5.0|fun little book. i found it both funny and sad at times. i liked the ending. i will look for more of her books.
B0011ZVTEO|5.0|I really like this album, and found it after  i saw the film based on the making of this album. if you like cuban Music and the latin style it is a no brainer...
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This is an awesome book I guarantee it!!! But make sure u read this book last though! Thank you james dashner!
6305433909|5.0|Gotta love a show that makes you smile and tap your feet... Whoopi always has that talent. What a woman.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I thank this so wonderful it helps me with my homework and i sure do need also when I did my homework the first time when we went over it i<br />got everything Right
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Beautiful Creatures, and the movie got me started reading the series. The second book, Beautiful Darkness, held my interest and I really enjoyed it, so much so that I will begin the third book of the series today!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app  overall is relatively good. It does not require internet access. While most games do. Also this game is great for the plane because it keeps you occupied.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|This movie is a rousing action adventure based loosely around the life of Abraham Lincoln.  I am not sure I like using our historical figures in this fashion, but I have to admit that this was well done and I enjoyed it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We got the BluRay version of the discs, and it makes a great difference. The imagery visuals are quite wonderful this way. The cinematography is excellent in the series, and this makes it even more so.<br /><br />The writing is better so far as well, the secondary characters are better, more rounded out as people. It makes for a better series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I was happy to find this game I love bingo.  The speed at which the numbers is called is perfect.  From different countries adds a little shake up.  Interesting.  Love the heads up when game is coming to an end.  I don't like the facebook included it is distracting.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Yes, it's a totally different Bond movie. But that's OK. I like the more cerebral Daniel Craig Bond movies, with less emphasis on high-tech, underscored hilariously by Q's outfitting of Bond with a pistol and a radio transmitter, period. \\"Not exactly Christmas, is it?\\"<br /><br />This is a thinking man's 007 movie, harkening back to the original Sean Connery films. And I swear, I thought the movie was over at the island, but there was still an hour to go. Then came the best part. The second half probably left a lot of people flat, those who appreciate the super-gadgetry of the Brosnan and Roger Moore Bond movies especially. But I found it deep and emotional, and Bond really had to try to stay alive.<br /><br />I hope they keep doing these type of Bond movies with Daniel Craig. You can believe in this James Bond.
B001224WBS|5.0|This Volume one has all the memorable hits from the past.  Great selection and purchase.  Was able to download immediately at a great price.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|I thought this would be an animated feature but it was a nice surprise to learn I was wrong. very well filmed and nicely rounds out a part of the history of the Halo universe, in addition to being a partial prologue to Halo 4.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This Film was nominated for 8 Academy Awards, and for good reason. All four acting roles are nominated as well as Best Picture and Director. I can easily say that this will go on to be a classic. It's emotionally charged, has a witty script, phenomenal performances, (especially Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar!) funny, and most of all, relatable. I saw this back in November when it was in limited release and I've seen it six times since then. I'm relieved that it won at least one Oscar. Definitely one of the best movies of the year and definitely one of my favorites. Plus, you can never go wrong with De Niro.
B002WCLG48|5.0|This is an interesting collection of short animated stories across different characters during different times throughout the Halo Universe, and no two stories are the same due to the production and the style of animation involved. The opening 2-parter alone recounts a pretty decent timeline of the events preceeding the Halo events in milennia gone by. A personal highlight is the closing episode 'The Package' with the pace and action of this tale finishing the DVD on a high ntoe and leaving the viewer wanting more.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved firefly and have had my eye on the series for a long time.  I was hoping I could find it for a good price and sure enough, I did!  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|This is a fun game of physics and chain reaction.Gets more challenging as you go. Great Graphics too. Fun for all ages
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Un libro entretenido de grandes aventuras escrito en un lenguaje sencillo para grandes y chicos, recomendable para pasar un buen rato.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Greetings, Programs! I have been a huge fan of this movie ever since I first saw it back in 1982 when it was initially released in theaters. Back then I had never witnessed anything quite like it in movies, and now over thirty years later it still looks fantastic and wows me every time that I see it. And it looks even better on Blu-ray. Even the new DVD version is incredible looking with rich colors and sharp definition that blows away my old DVD copy from just a few years ago.<br /><br />I won't go into detail describing the movie's storyline as I am sure that most people out there are well aware by now of Tron's premise and other reviewers have already touched on it, but I will say that the movie still holds up very well and is just as relevant today as it ever was, maybe even moreso in this age of the Internet and Wifi and cell phones, and Facebook etcetera. Heck, I just really love this movie like crazy and it only gets better and better the more times that I watch it. The sequel, Tron: Legacy is great too, and I cannot wait to see the third installment.
B00000K31Q|5.0|One of my all time fav movies!  I watch it all the time with my daughter!  The scene on the football field where Heath sings, love it!  And especially her poem at the end, makes me tear up still to this day!
0061733199|5.0|Alot of useful information in this handbook. I would recommend anyone looking to spend time outdoors to purchase this handbook and read it thoroughly.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Good story but slow read at times. Liked watching their disastrous relationship blossom into a happy ending. Good romantic novel.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This is a good addition to the accounts of air warfare in WWII from the American bomber and German fighter pilot perspective.  While the book jacket and introduction indicates that it is focused on a single incident where a German ME-109 pilot did not shoot down a crippled, sitting-duck B-17, it is actually most useful when telling the entire war history of the German, from his combat in North Africa, Italy, in defense of Germany, and ending with his assignment to an all-star team of German aces who flew the jet ME-262 up to war's end.  The poignant last sections of the book, which emphasize the post-war lives of both pilots, and their eventual personal contact, ends the book on an uplifting note.<br />Regarding the writing itself, the early chapters almost read as if written for young adults.  As I was drawn into the story, the occasionally clunky style was overshadowed by the personal triumphs and tragedies of the two men and their colleagues.
1449417051|5.0|This is a fun and hilarious book. I will definitely recommend for any friend, or stranger, thats a cat lover.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game so much!!! It's the best game for the kindle fire I've played so far. He looks super creepy in this version, and its even creepier he talks to you!!! If your looking for a creepy game, you need this one for sure!!!!
B00004XMTJ|1.0|I had no idea what they were singing about the entire time. Its was depressing and not good. Do not buy.
B008ENA74E|4.0|This is a very informative book for the basic premise that Goldman Sachs' has changed from customer oriented to profit driven.  The story is biographical in an upbeat, chronological, light humored, intelligent style.<br />The country went through the 1929 Depression with the Government's constuctively critical guidance, but importantly this time - not so much.<br />The book gives illuminating glimpses into the financial system and it's culture, it's importance to the average person, and explains the reasons for the outrageously outsized salaries.  Really good enlightened look at Wall Street.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 was crammed with lots of life (and unfortunately) death.  Hated to see some of my favorite characters go, but can't wait until Season 4!
B004I744AS|5.0|The free version offers not only word definitions (with prompts for spelling!) but antonyms/synonyms, wiki entries and more. if you enjoy the game of 'hangman', or, like me, prefer to test your vocabulary with the daily word-match, or you just like to find interesting and unusual names, places, dates offered for your persusal, this product has it all. I use it all the time.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This video is more of an adventure snowboarding video instead of That's It That's All which was more of a progression video.<br />This video will take you to places that other people have never been snowboarding or skiing.  It is a great look at what is out there and what the riders run into along the way.  Yes there is some progression as well, but for me it is about the adventure in this video.
B005LAII8K|3.0|Time travel stories are... difficult. Star Trek is proof of that. I think two things play into it: 1. No one can agree on how time travel would actually work if it's possible. Or if it's possible. 2. Because of that, writers like to use it as a magic wand. It's one of those things I kind of hate in science fiction, when the writer uses some bit of science like it's magic just because no one knows how it works. If you want to write magic, go write fantasy.<br /><br />Still, all in all, I don't think the time travel was handled too poorly in Looper other than the constant paradoxes that were never addressed. What I have a problem with is being lied to, and, in essence, the movie hinges on a lie, and that really bothers me.<br /><br />Now, I don't have a problem with being deceived through sleight-of-hand and trickery. The Sixth Sense is so great because Shyamalan  never lied to the audience. He laid everything out there for us to see and allowed us not to see it. A couple of movies that are very similar except that one lies and one doesn't are The Prestige and The Illusionist (which I talk about for a bit here). The Illusionist achieves its climax by lying to the audience (through omission) all the way through, which is the only reason we are unable to piece the plot together. I really have no respect for that.<br /><br />Now, if you haven't seen Looper, there will be spoilers.<br /><br />The whole story of Looper hinges on  the belief by the audience that young Joe dies when he falls from the ladder. At that point, the movie jumps back as if that is the moment that causes the reset. When it starts over, we accept that we are seeing a different time line because of the presentation, and it's not true. It's not like in The Sixth Sense when Crowe gets shot. Afterward, the audience just assumes that Crowe didn't die even though Shyamalan tells us several times, &#34;look, this guy's dead.&#34; We just can't see it. In Looper, the truth is never offered until the end, when the lie is revealed, and that's just a cheap way of doing it.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the director or the writer or someone comes out and tells us that the movie isn't going to make any sense and not to think about it. Young Joe and Old Joe are sitting in a diner together, and Young Joe asks Old Joe about time travel, and Old Joe says, &#34;I don't want to talk about time travel because, if we start talking about it, then, we're going to be here all day talking about it, making diagrams with straws.&#34; Rough translation: &#34;Don't think about it; just watch the movie. We can't explain it either.&#34; On the one hand, I'm glad they're honest about it. &#34;Look, we just want to tell our story, so don't go trying to logic it, because it won't make any sense.&#34; [And it doesn't.] On the other hand, I'm kind of insulted. It says to me that they didn't want to bother with telling a story that makes sense, which devalues me as the audience. And, then, they lie to make it work.<br /><br />The other thing that really bothers me is that the movie didn't happen, and I hate stories that didn't happen. I hate getting to the end and finding out that it was all a dream or a vision or a whatever. I mean, this was as bad as Next with Nicolas Cage. You get to the end and find out that, really, the movie ended right there when Young Joe kills Old Joe at the beginning of the movie. That's it. End of story. Everything else is just &#34;closing the loop&#34; and doesn't actually exist. I really felt cheated.<br /><br />Even so, there are some good moments in the film. When Old Seth is trying to get to Young Seth and losing body parts all along the way... man, that's just freaky. It doesn't make any sense from a paradox perspective, but it's creepy enough that you don't care. The horror of that moment as his fingers start disappearing is gut wrenching. Also, I really liked Paul Dano as Young Seth.<br /><br />There's a lot of humor, dark humor, in the fact that Old Joe keeps beating the crap out of his younger self. There's the urge to slap Young Joe for not listening to his older self, but, then, that's how all kids are, right?  And there's the fact that the good guys don't win. How could they? There are no good guys. But there aren't a lot of movies these days where the protagonist (hero or anti-hero) fails, and that's almost enough to make Looper worth watching all by itself.<br /><br />If you're willing to just turn your brain off and watch and if you don't mind being lied to, Looper is definitely worth your time, just don't ever say, &#34;But why...?&#34;<br /><br />Oh, also, a big part of why Looper works is the inherent belief of the audience (and that includes me) in the badassness of Bruce Willis. There is nothing in the movie to support Joe being any kind of badass. In fact, he's more of a loser, drug addict than anything else. However, because our image of Willis is that he's a badass, we don't question him single-handedly taking down a criminal organization even though there is nothing in the movie to support this.

1612130283|1.0|I read the first pages on Google Books. When the preview stopped, I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />I liked the basic storyline but the writing was horrific. I kept rolling my eyes at how many times Ana 'blushed', and then Christian kept 'cocking his head'. LOL. Also it was annoying how Ana kept referring to him as 'hot', and variations thereof.<br /><br />Again, lol @ this series. James should've found a decent editor.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|I love the fast paced-action in this movie. The addition of Christopher Eccleston is amazing and he does a great Job. Doctor Who is lucky to have had this guy in the past.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|By now, everyone knows how season 3 turned out!  I have watched movies all my life, which is a VERY long time..and it is the first time I found myself sitting with my jaw hanging open.  Stunned!<br />If we wanted reality, we certainly got it!  Who ever thought the very rich and affluent had things lovely because of money, certainly had reality smack them in the face in the Masterpiece Classic.  I own all of it...and am already watching it again.  You can never get it all the first time through.  THOSE are the kinds of movies I buy.  Ones that I never tire of.  Like a good novel...this drama keeps your interest...and for it probably always will.  Like Gone With the Wind...or Out of Africa.  Marvelous!

Only solution was to force a power off. It would be good to have the controls recognize if the camera has been flipped and mirrored. Still give the app a 5 star rating.

They always give you your money's worth in concert, and 2112 is still my favorite of all their albums.  This remastered release, with the accompanying video is a fantastic upgrade of the original.  A must for all RUSH fans!

B003G4W49C|3.0|This was a good story, with a strong plot. Unfortunately, like so many other books and movies that would be otherwise great, it inexplicably contains unnecessary profanity. To a lot of people these days this doesn't matter, but it matters to me. I view it as an insecurity in writers who resort to profanity, immorality, or violence to engage a reader--as if they don't think their writing itself is good enough. I also won't be sharing Ender's Game with my kids, as they have thankfully developed a distaste for profanity as well.

159420411X|3.0|I heard a Nate Silver interviewed and was really looking forward to this book, but there are enough errors that it makes me wonder if he know's what he's talking about when I don't know better...<br />1.  Column headings on fig 1-2 reverse perfectly correlated and perfect independance.<br />2.  Math is wrong in fig 1-2:  A winning bet for the epsilon pool is .95^5 = .774 or 77.4%, so a losing bet has a probability of 22.6%!<br />3.  Labels wrong in fig 11-9:  All segments of pie charts labeled institutional investors when context makes clear two segments are individual investors.<br />I have doubts on a few other claims but not enough confidence to call them out.<br />Bottom line:  Nate Silver is clearly a bright and talented writer.  He would benefit from better proof reading/editing.

0765350386|4.0|Coming in at 643 pages, this was a longer book than I originally thought it would be and, I have to admit, a good portion of it moves very slowly. The story revolves a thieving crew's plot to finally topple the rule of the despot who has kept the realm, and most especially the skaa (think peasant class), under his cruel thumb for a thousand years.  The crew's leader, Kelsier, has his own personal reasons for wanting to initiate such a seemingly crazy, suicidal plan and he enlists the aid of his very own band of merry men.  New to the group is Vin, a 16 year old girl who has grown up rough on the street.  Because of the enormity of the undertaking, the crew gives itself a one year timetable in which to bring their plan to fruition.  This is where the plot really slows down but it makes sense because it takes time to maneuver all the players and pieces into place.<br /><br />The book is divided into five parts and is told in third person mostly from the POV of Vin and Kelsier, though occasionally another character is thrown in.  As I mentioned before, the story moves slowly not only because of all the political machinations but because Vin is learning about an entirely new way of life.  I liked Vin though at times she could be annoying with her stubborness, as most 16 year olds are wont to be.  I did enjoy her relationship with Kelsier and the mentor-mentee dynamic they had going on.  There is a small romance element to the story though thankfully not between Kel and Vin (he's mid-thirties and she's 16!).<br /><br />This is the first in a trilogy and I wasn't sure at times if I would move on to the other two books, despite liking several of the characters, but Part 5 really grabbed my attention again.  There were some interesting reveals and some sad bits that made me cry. The characters are mostly likeable, the world-building is very good, and the magic system (for lack of a better phrase) using various metals is interesting and fresh (or at least it was new to me).

B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Whenever something starts off as a beloved graphic novel or comic book series; there are always troubles in adapting it to visual media.  Less so for animation then live acting, but still, most of these are 75 minute condensed versions of the former.  What strikes me, is that these versions use the visual media to convey some of the books better moments, they tend to stay faithful to the original artists and mood.<br /><br />Hey, we learned from the &#34;WATCHMEN&#34; that some adaptations can't be too accurate and exact.  Some editing and less soliloquy are necessary.  Comics lead but don't do so heavy handed-they allow the reader to fill in the gaps.  Video can't quite do that, but they can pack the scene with visual cues and action - requiring you to rewatch it to see and understand everything going on.  In live action - the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; series comes to mind, in Animation, these DC Graphic Adaptations have been filling that niche.<br /><br />I guess the best thing to say is DC does get this part right.  Animation has been DC's best media to advance their products.

1455523550|4.0|If Nicholas Sparks were to be found in the dictionary, his name would be synonymous with the words, romance (that one should be obvious), beach (his settings always involve one) and tragedy (cruelly he has a penchant for breaking the reader's heart as well as his protagonists). In the pattern that has become his stories, so much of the plot involves secrets and a leading couple who go through multitudes of issues and mentally, free-falling emotions that engage not only them but the reader just to be left wondering if the couple even have the promise of one day being together - and even then, sometimes, the lovers are parted. Fortunately, I've gone two-for-two which chose a happier approach (but to be fair, I should confess that I cheated, knowing that was to be the case). Safe Haven is only the second novel I've read and were it not for such a lackluster ending, I'd have quite adored this book. It's different with its hints of mystery and a frightened heroine who sees potential danger in every shadow, something that not only grips the reader but heightens in us a sense of awareness.<br /><br />As always, Sparks provided compelling characters. Katie, Alex and his two small children captivated me. I didn't want to quit reading of their delightful adventures and felt satisfied with so many of the story elements. This included an above-board romance (though not for the \\"right\\" reasons) in addition to a prose that entices, enchants and engages. Each of the chapters further develops the characters though the prose is a bit flawed - or perhaps it'd be the way the story is told that is most at fault. Multiple chapters re-count one event, making certain moments far too long then there is the switch from two POV's to three midway through plus Katie's wrenching narrations of her past life. During these portions and approximately three-fourths of the way through, Katie' personality seems to become less of the kind-hearted woman we've come to love. While she remembers that past, it wrecks havoc with the reader's feelings to experience first-hand the things she did and dealt with in order to make life \\"easier.\\" Because of that, the book is less romance and wonders into more of a mysterious territory which is said to be a departure from normal for Sparks. Indeed the book did read differently.<br /><br />Common as this story may be thought of, it's a hard look at the touchy topic of abuse while keeping pace with some lighter, happier moments that balances everything really nice. The ending does sneak up on us and that lessens the sense of that \\"warm, fuzzy feeling\\" a happy-ending girl like me appreciates. By the end of the book, I was impressed. Perhaps the plot wasn't as unique as it could have been or the character's were sometimes stilted and still, for a Nicholas Sparks novel, it's a keeper.<br /><br />© Copyright 2011-2013 Dreaming Under the Same Moon / Scribbles, Scripts and Suchit wrecks havoc with the reader's feelings to experience first-hand the things she did and dealt with in order to make life \\"easier.\\" Because of that, the book is less romance and wonders into more of a mysterious territory which is said to be a departure from normal for Sparks.

I am not doing too much shootings with the flash mounted as it has been mostly outdoors until now after I got the D800 and I see the need for an upgrade to SB910 which is reviewed as very good for power and it's more advanced features are very tempting and more importantly does not overheat as much as the SB900.

B00B0NF4L6|3.0|You're pathetic...  You know that?\\"  -Prison Warden to Michael Gordon Peterson (aka Charles Bronson) from the film Bronson  ----------------    Fidlar keep to topics that are simple, stupid and pointless, which is the way that I want my 60's laced garage band punk rock to be. Then again, the person(s) responsible for the lyrics, while not the second coming of GG Allin -not even close, is a hard one to figure. I wonder if I've ever confronted 40 minutes of more addle, nihilistic, misogynistic, misanthropic, and hedonistic anthems in my near half a century of life? Sure, taking each one of those descriptors at a time, Fidlar has been easily been exceeded by others: What I'm talking about is the whole package. Here's the rub, these are all \\"high functioning\\" addle, nihilistic, misogynistic, misanthropic, and hedonistic anthems. Taken as a whole (again), it's a paragon of the pathetic, and that makes this an \\"achievement\\" and the lyrics do not suggest the achieving type. \\"Wait!\\", my paranoia demands. These guys are just f***ing with an uptight old man. This is not self-referential, but a deliberate and masterfully executed parody, or self parody (that is what one stream of punk was fully invested in by the mid 1980's), or, better yet, this is satire. This \\"review\\" is exhausting me. Let's change the subject.    Thank my lucky stars that the composition of the guitar, drums and bass is not as bemusing as the lyrics. Here, these guys are, within the bounds of the post-punk revival, consummate artists. Every moment of every song is so infectiously fun, clever, heterogeneous, and thrilled to be alive that my brain is rendered indifferent to everything about the lyrics that makes me break out into a rash. All of which suggests that more is at play than intuition and cocaine -I detect craft and discipline. Tricky, tricky boys. Heck, these guys are so tricky that I caught myself singing out loud \\"You take Sally, and I'll take Sue/There ain't no difference between the two\\". Ah,that's f***ed up -which is the way that I want my reaction to my reaction to 60's laced garage band punk rock to be.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|...I certainly didn't expect that; overall, this was a good movie; couple of the characters are predictable and stock, and thus less enjoyable; some are distastefully shallow (but then, I've met my share of those, too); special effects are good... I'm not overly critical of science fiction movies, because I love the genre, and especially because of all the dreadful ones I saw in my childhood and early adult years.  This one's definitely a keeper, as is almost anything Ridley Scott directs, but I wouldn't put this near the top of his efforts.
B009CPE424|4.0|Very cute movie. It wasn't as good as the frst one but it was still really cute and the quaity was great,
B004MYF4SS|5.0|As in the other books, wind rain and storms are omnipresent 'characters' lowering down on the poor mortals below and doing their best to squash them.  The book's main hero, Fin Macleod has a life that is overshadowed by tragedy largely of his own making, although he is not an unsympathetic person.  He is cruel and neglectful of his wife and of the woman he first loved, not because he intends to be but because he only follows his own inclinations without giving any thought to them.  The story keeps you guessing right until the end and never fails to be interesting and the people in the story are very human and believable, even the eccentric ones!  I'd advise anyone reading this trilogy no to do what I did, which was to read them out of sequence as this can lead to confusion.  There are many flashbacks to earlier times in all the books so it's easier to follow if read in the right order.  These books are so very convincing because although they are mystery novels, you get the characters down to the last gritty detail - what primary school they went to, the view of fields from there and the grey haired teacher.  Really compulsive reading!

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|it was fun but too short. I wish games like this one did last a bit longer. it did help pass the time though
B0071XO8RA|2.0|The book offers promise at the beginning, but loses its attraction as it progresses. After the mid section it's near dead, and I skimmed it to the end.<br />As others have said the character development is rather weak, as in the case of Bernard, he takes over the silo after killing and eliminating people but we do not get to look closely into Bernard himself, and so his character seems thin. Another instance of poor development is the relation between Lukas and Jules. Instead of fleshing out this relationship,  and thereby adding a beautiful love story, he makes huge leaps, going from an initial stage where there is little between them to a full blown love at the end, and we are left feeling cheated. This seems to run through the book.<br />The writer spends a sinful amount of time making Jules dive to the depths of her new silo and then going up back, but there is only so much of that a person can take. There was one thing which kept me wondering, and that was the near lack of preparation for war on the part of Knox. Knox seemed to totally underestimate the nature of war feeling that takeover would be easy and it makes him seem silly in not preparing for a full blown fight. Why would the author want this, particular for a character that he seems to like?<br />All in all it would seem that the author is immature and does not understand the importance of giving us three dimensional people with whom we can identify or try to understand, so the book leaves the needs of readers unattended. The question is how it got so many five star ratings.<br />At this point I am not tempted to read any more of his books.

030758836X|2.0|This story bounced back and forth between journals of husband and wife as their marriage crumbles before our reading eyes.  The turns and twists of the plot are interesting and cleverly contrived.  However, the ending of the book was totally unfair to the reader because there is no clear cut conclusion.  In talking with other readers, no one is sure of the implied ending.  I supposed she killed him, therefore getting the last word as she said she did.  Or it could have meant something else.  Who really knows except the author?  It is a long book and time-consuming, but overall not worth the journey.

B003UBTX6S|4.0|I enjoyed the first book, Beautiful Creatures, immensely.  It was an enjoyable romp through a magical small town with characters that, while stereotypical, were also quite lovable.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed it, I think I enjoyed book two, Beautiful Darkness, more than the first.  The teen love story side of it is a backburner issue in this novel.  Focusing less on the RELATIONSHIP between Ethan and Lena and more on ALL of the relationships in the story -- friendship, rivalries, great evils, powerful goods, family, sacrifices for loved ones, etc.<br /><br />As the small group of tiny Mortals (Ethan, Link, and adorable new character Liv) and one special kitty (Lucille Ball) follow Lena to the ends of the magical world to save her, deep within the Caster Tunnels, bonds are explored in a much deeper fashion, and Ethan connects more people to the Caster world than in previous books. Apparently his life, family, and destiny has been intertwined with this world long before he was born, and he discovers that his fate is that of a Wayward -- a mortal with the uncanny gift of leading Casters (and sometimes Mortals alike) to their own destinies.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the rest of the series!

B004EPYZOO|4.0|Library DVD rental. I thought this would be another version of \\"Gone In 60 Seconds\\", and couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />The first 15-20 minutes was a festival of f-bombs...meh... and then it slacked off and started to get intriguing. For being all the raunchy, bloody, snafu'd plot, the character development is really impressive, although you almost don't realize it's happening. And then you're like \\"oh, I've seen this story before, but not like this, wow this is really cool.\\"<br /><br />Action, check. Humor, check. Blood, check... but not gory guts, more in a he-deserved-it-haha way.<br /><br />Wholesome adult fun- better with beer or JD. Good entertainment value. Watch it.

B001L116W8|5.0|Since my dad bought the LP in 1958, I've listened to this album so many times it must be permanently embedded into my neurons. This is Frank Sinatra's greatest of many achievements: one classic &#34;suicide&#34; song after another, the artistry of singer, arrangement, conductor, and orchestra combining to transform popular music into high art. Sinatra's phrasing is perfect—generally rather defeatedly understated, trying futilely to generate a little hope—and there's no unctuous emoting. Every one of these jewels is presented just right, and no sensitive listener can help but be stunned.<br /><br />Many great songs are performed well by various singers, and sometimes a singer makes a song his own, such that nobody else's version really counts. As far as I'm concerned, Sinatra did that with every song on this album, which is quite something considering the winners on this disc. If you have this &#34;Blues in the Night,&#34; don't even bother to listen to any other version.<br /><br />But &#34;Only the Lonely&#34; hardly needs my recommendation. It has rightfully been praised since its release, and I suspect that people will be listening to it &#34;ages and ages hence.&#34; So how about this recording, and the mono sound? In short, the sound is superb, and the fact that it is mono becomes insignificant right away. You won't even notice.<br /><br />This Mobile Fidelity version blows away the first (1987) CD incarnation and the later 1998 US Capitol mastering, which suffered from a lot of obvious tinkering, apparently to eliminate tape hiss (as if anybody who knows this recording would care about barely audible hiss). If you can find it, the best stereo mastering is the 1998 UK version, which rivals the MF in terms of clarity and natural sound. It was in the UK &#34;Capitol Years&#34; collection, but I don't know whether it was ever available singly.<br /><br />One last note. I do not miss &#34;Sleep Warm&#34; or &#34;Where or When.&#34; They were not on the original album, they're of a genre different from that of the other 12, and the album ends much better with &#34;One for My Baby.&#34;
B00APJLFEG|5.0|love it.  rent buy.  if you like to laugh out loud,  giggled. great for the kids  I would recommend this
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Love the zoom, can play games pretty much 3 feet away. Shipping was fast, good price. Only complaint was it didn't mention in the description that it didn't include the protective film you're supposed to put between the Kinect and the zoom itself but it's not necessarily required.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|A very long book, but good reading with seriousness and humor, too.  Many characters are featured whose life experiences are quite intriguing.
B00B2QA646|2.0|Keira K. shines as Anna K. but that's all this movie has going for it. Her lover is no more interesting than her husband is. And what's even worse is the horrible way they have staged and blocked the film.  It looks as if the actors are all performing on a big stage, then they're not.  Or one couple is dancing and all the others freeze.  Then later, Anna steps off of a train and is on a big ship (?) but really isn't, and everyone freezes in place. Whatever kind of artsy stuff they were going for, it just did not work and really distracted me from the story.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I waited untill I had the opportunity (free time) to read. I am glad I chose these books. A must for every collection

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is full of challenges and has a good story line. I do not find myself getting bored as easily like with other games.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This was the first version of ANGRY BIRDS I ever played. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the ads. Invest in the ad free version.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was just a little drawn out as i found myself having to just push through to the end.  The battle could have been shorter with greater effect.
B004SBX112|5.0|This is the second version of angry birds I have played and it's better than the original. I am looking forward to buying another version.
034580404X|5.0|a very, very good read. Definitely worth the price. I will look for more from this author in the future.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|My husband went to the concert and now shares his stories of that night with the music that he loves.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked this book because it gives more better definitions than any other dictionary. It also have me better grades in English class with my vocabulary homework. I think I would recommend this book to my teachers at school or actually tell the teachers to get this dictionary instead of the ones they have now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was sad ,but that is only a reveiw of a12 year old. It had some funny times but over all it was fantastic
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I missed seeing this on the big screen and couldn't find it at any stores near me... I finally got it and let me say that it is now on my top all time favorite vampire films and plus it's honest Abraham Lincoln kicking ass.... Hell yeah!!!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Obviously, the way this season ended was a bit of a downer but overall I found this season to be just as engaging as the first two.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Great for being at work or school on a break keeps you busy and figuring how to breed different dragons
B007HYV56U|5.0|GRAND PRIX (1966): 10/10 for film buffs, 8/10 for auto racing fans, 7/10 for fans of classics, 6/10 for the typical movie goer. Story of 4 drivers battling through a formula one season. The young, dumb upstart; the weary legend at the end of his career (Jean-Pierre), the American, Pete, on his come back trail with Yamura (aka Honda), and Scott, the British driver who is injured. Also follows 3 of the women who love them, including Eva Marie Saint. Also stars a very handsome Toshiro Mifune as the head of Yamura, and an iron willed Ferrari boss.. Touches on many issues with surprisingly progressiveness, like Toshiro having killed 17 Americans in WWII.<br /><br />The most important thing about this movie is the technicals. The on board cameras of F1 cars driving at speed is still viscerally beautiful, and a film buff will appreciate how hard it all was and that the same techniques were applied in RONIN decades later (same director: John Frankenheimer). Mounted cameras that pan and rotate (for the banks of Monza), the sound, the helicopter shots. The trailer shows what it will look like; if you don't get a thrill, you won't enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Music is an unfortunate disappointment in the era of excellent scores like the Man With No Name Trilogy.
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|A who done it as only PKD could deliver.  A new world, a new reality that is never quite what you would expect.
B009NCM248|5.0|This is Stone Sour's best album yet! If you're a Stone Sour fan you won't be disappointed! Worth the money!
B0018CENUC|5.0|But I didn't have any of his albums - this one gave me enough to enjoy without going overboard. Its a good listen.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good game, happy to see amazon competing with Apple apps. Easy to pass time with. Plenty of levels to keep busy
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is so much fun and you have so many free choices for puzzles. It can be either easy or difficult. The music it comes with is not annoying and actually relaxing. If you want to buy games they seem to be about .99 each. enjoy
B0079XNWQA|4.0|This is a very welll written album. It's so refreshing to hear about love, feeling good, and loving life. Instead of loss, heartbreak, and sorrow. &#34;I will not give up&#34; is very powerful.
B008I34YYY|5.0|Over the top and seriously fun so long as you are not taking it overly serious!  Well worth the watch!
B0013FNC38|3.0|This is a bit older albums. Has a lot of brass and band in it. Most of the songs are not as good as Love is a 4 letter word. But Beautiful Mess, is one of his best songs I've heard.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Originally downloaded this app for my daughter but find myself playing it myself more than her. lol not a bad game at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is the best game ever invented I never thought a game could be so awsome plz make a sequel.
B009NCM248|5.0|This album rocks!  I can't listen to it enough.  Stone Sour is an awesome band with real talent.  Love, love, love!

0062218867|4.0|Snuff is a Terry Pratchett Discworld novel, with the fantasy that comes with that, but this book is heavy on the darker themes and lighter on the humor than most Discworld books.  Perhaps as he fights Alzheimer's, Mr. Pratchett has less to laugh at, and this book suffers from a dearth of humor.<br /><br />The plot is straightforward:  Sam Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork city watch, goes on holiday to the countryside and finds himself tangled up in a slavery ring.  There are powerful people up to no good, and it's up to Sam to uncover what happened and to bring it to an end and to see that the guilty are punished.  He meets a number of interesting people along the way, some of whom have bearing on his investigation and some of whom are merely local color.<br /><br />I don't much like Sam Vimes as a character. He runs rough-shod over the law and attempts to dominate everyone he meets in a way that I find annoying.  But his adventures are interesting, and I've read several of the Watch books to follow the character on his rounds.  This book has darker themes than much of Pratchett's fiction, which I liked just fine, but in the end it ties up nicely, and the guilty are punished (after a fashion; after all, the law works differently for the well-heeled).  Just be ready for a more serious outing this time around.
0399536108|5.0|One of the best books Ive read in a while. Just buy it, you won't regret it. Do It Now!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|If youre intrested in food production, what you eat, the animals and how things hang together, you have to watch this documentary.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Foes not work at all.  Will not open. is it because its free!! ill just delete it and forget about
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love the app but whenever I try to play it, it takes 10 minutes before I can get in to play the app.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Havent had a chance to watch this movie yet. Looking forward to see how it predicts where we are in 2013....
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell really hit the ball out of the park with this book. I've always been skeptical of the notion that all a person needs to do to become successful is simply &#34;lift oneself up by one's bootstraps&#34; and just do it.<br /><br />There is just way too many actors involved, such as coming from a great family that is smart enough to know how to guide you, living in an environment that has the infrastructure to support your ambitions, having a patron or belonging to a &#34;good ol' boy&#34; system that will put you in play, and so much more. No human being has the ability to do it alone.<br /><br />Gladwell lays out the facts in an easy to read format and he also lays to rest this insane notion that guys like Bill Gates simply got rich because of their own ambition and intelligence and nothing more.<br /><br />I only hope that the right people read this book and realize that all children no matter who they are and where they came from deserve an opportunity to survive and thrive. That's all I have to say about this review.<br /><br />Just read it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham again has a fine plot, but he seems to be moving in the direction of Patterson. That is, the novel itself is little more than an outline. Since so little is developed during the telling of the story, he devotes the final chapter to narrative explaining how everything happened. Better writing would make this unnecessary.  That said, it is a fun read.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|One of the best books written. Couldn't put it down since the first page!! Please let there be a sequel!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought this first and second season of Downton Abbey thinking I would watch while my husband was at work but we started watching together and we are both now big fans.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|All I can say  is, if you're any sort of Star Wars/ Lego fan, and you're sitting on the fence about buying this, don't wait. The biggest complaint I hear about Legos in general, seems to be the price tag, but this set is so worth it. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The detail in the set is amazing. I've been a Star Wars fan for 35 years, and playing with and collecting the toys for just as long, and I don't think I've ever seen any toy with this amount of scope and action features, and of course the shear number of mini-figs that come along with this. Seriously, if there was anything that was seen in the Star Wars movies, they somehow managed to cram it all into one very spiffy looking, albeit huge, toy. For example, there's a little blue box on wheels that you assemble with the mini-figs. At first I thought it was another droid, but it opens up to reveal a little gun like thing and some computer equipment. It took me a while to figure out it was supposed to be the blue box the imperials were bringing aboard the Millennium Falcon to scan for life forms. If they include that one little prop, you can imagine how much else they threw in.<br /><br />Everything looks exactly like it does in the movies. The Emperor's throne room is especially cool looking and spacious. The placement of some of the rooms is a bit strange however, like the room where Luke and Leia swing across the broken bridge leads directly to the tractor beam room which in turn leads to no other room. Still, again, they included so much stuff, only a die-hard fan would notice.<br /><br />A few, very minor complaints, which should in no way take away from my overall rating. These are just tiny things.<br /><br />One. The big round laser cannon/ crater thing was a bit of a pain to put together. At one point, one of the hinge pieces unsnapped, and after that, I was unable to hinge the joint together again. I ended up having to glue it in place, which I consider ruining the model, but it looks good when together.<br /><br />Also, I find the Lego peoples choice for some of the mini-figs to be a bit odd. They could have included an imperial officer or two. The Death Star has a meeting room with seven chairs, but no officers to have a meeting with. Also too many unnecessary droids that weren't in the movies. There's a black R2-D2 and C-3PO, but the silver Death Star droid, that was featured in the old Kenner line of toys is no where to be seen, and would have made a much more logical choice. Again, these are just minor grievances from a long time SW fan. The casual collector will probably never notice.<br /><br />In conclusion a very awesome model though it might take some time to build. Maybe not for the very young, but I've read several reviews of kids putting it together by themselves, and have nothing but respect for that. I'm 40 years old and it took me little over a week to put together, working on it a little bit each day, so hats off to anyone who's up to the challenge. It was such a joy to put together.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|So far I like the game. The graphics are really good.  I am not a huge technical person.  I have many electronic toys but I dont delve deep into the technical aspects.  I just like to play.  I gave 4 starz now because I haven't found an instruction manual to look up my questions.  Thd tutorial is good so far.  Itasks for areview fairly early in the game.  We will see what I think of this game later.  I am playing on my fire hd 8.9&quot;.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is what truely can be called a timeless masterpiece. The rendition of Les Miserables created here is one of the most breath-taking beautiful performances I've ever seen in my life. Having read the book and seen the musical many times, I was so pleased with the true dedication that the cast showed with their performance. I know many were upset with Russell Crowe's singing performance but I never pictured Javert having what would be called a lovely singing voice. Plus he does not have the experience that someone like Hugh Jackman has. In the end, I can look past that. Anne Hathaway blew me away with her version of I Dreamed a Dream(A version that was far more pleasant and inspiring than that of Susan Boyle). It does not happen often but Anne's performance and the rest of the cast had me bursting into tears(both of laughter and joy/sorrow and sadness) This movie will be remembered for a long time and not easily forgotten. I hope those who have not seen it will do so as soon as possible. It is so worth it.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Yes it is violent but the story lines are so interesting that the violence is only a small part.  you actually find yourself liking most of the characters.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Enjoyed this book!  I found it difficult to put down.  I will recommend it to anyone asking me what they should read next.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love playing Mahjong and the tiles in this version are excellent. I use it on my Kindle Fire and love it
B004GHNIRK|2.0|It was not the story line of the movie.  I made a mistake in ordering this book but I guess it was to late to change order.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to someone. It was a very good book. So, if you like the original ~Diary of a Wimpy Kid~ you will like this book.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Works as advertised. If you want to add volume to your headphones, then this is the right one to purchase. Seller was fast and everything needed is in the box when it arrives. Cant say about he battery yet but I have a 15 hour plane ride coming and I'll find out then.
B008RC72G8|3.0|Okay movie; now in blu ray library.  If we watch again, we will skip a lot of over-extended, tedious scenes.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Absolutely terrible editing and overuse of identical words within the same sentence or near by. It's a pity since it the author seemed to have a good concept for a world and characters, but poorly written with an unrealistic speed of events.<br /><br />Would NOT recommend.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this book for my son as a gift. He's only 6 and he loves this series. He takes this book everywhere we go, for now..lol!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the most accurate weather app.  I have found so far. I have this one on all my devices.  It's actually better than my local news station. It's definitely worth downloading.
0547884591|5.0|As a fan of Tim's works... This book was the one that we thought should have been first.  It's the learning short cuts that make the decision making process so much easier.  Thank you for your efforts Tim... This one rocks!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love all of Colleen Hoover's books.  They are written so eloquently and make the reader feel so many emotions.  Her books are never predictable and always a roller coaster ride (I love roller coasters;).  Hopeless is as well written and interesting as her first two books- a really good book not to be missed!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I AM LOVING THIS GAME!! IT'S A HIDDEN OBJECT GAME AND MORE PUZZELS. IT. MAKES YOU USE YOUR BRAIN. I WOULD SAY TO GET THIS,  YOU WILL LOVE IT! ENJOY!!!!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|The book is organized into many cases. Because of this, it goes by quickly and provides a lot of variety. I had previously read a Study in Scarlet and found it to be much less enjoyable. I think this is one of Doyle's best, and a great place to start digging into Holmes.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The game is so awesome it is so epic. I love to play it when ever im boared. It is awesome
B005K17RU0|3.0|I 'bought' the 'premium' version from Amazon as a FAOTD for my HTC INSPIRE. Love it. But tried to download it for my Kindle, the only thing available is the 'free' version with ad, or purchase the now 'platinum' version to get rid of the ads on my Kindle. ??? Unable to get any answer from either Amazon or developer... they both seem to blame each other. No such problem with any other app.  :( So, what would be 5 star looses 2.<br />But all things considered, I dont really need it on my Kindle anyway. For my phone, its a great app.
0811879542|5.0|I bought this book sight unseen.  It's wonderful - what a clever idea!  It's for young children - maybe 4 and under - when they're at an age where they still believe in magic.  Also a delight for adults who understand how a young child's mind works.  I took it to work and everyone loved it.  One woman went out and bought it for her two year old twins, who made her read it to them 5 times in a row. It's nice to see something that's interactive with your brain, rather than just a computer program.  Now I need my friend to come over with her three year old!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|,This was the best book of the trilogy.  I enjoyed all the suspense and  action.  Grey's and Ana's interactions became more normal.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|This was a difficult book to mentally keep track of as I would have just short spurts to read...and the story kept moving from one time period to another and from one character to another.  I felt I needed to reread several passages just to keep the characters straight.  Once I got to about 70% through, the book went quite swiftly and I couldn't put it down.  It was a very interesting story with so many secrets  and character filters.  I am quite surprised that the &#34;mud man&#34; was such a best seller. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as a young girl with such a scary nightmarish storyline. I thought about it for several days after I finished it.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Darren really hits the nail on the head in this book. It's not about imaging the universe is going to give you everything! It's about setting your day with a good routine and ending the day the same way AND working like hell in the middle. If you haven't bought this one, you're missing out. I give it an 11 on a scale of 10.
B008S80P38|5.0|This artist keeps getting better and better. I bought this thru the AutoRip program that Amazon has. So now I have the Amazon cloud to access anywhere, as well as the CD's to play in my old cars AND was able to upload them to iTunes in my higher sized format for best MP3 sound.
0525425578|5.0|Great story. I loved it also. It is one of Grishams's best books yet.  Not the best, but close. Thanks.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have not slept without sleep aids for 20 years. Until now. Thank you for helping me get my life back.
B002LC8HF0|1.0|...divided by two is two stars for each book.<br /><br />Where to start with all that is wrong with this book?<br /><br />Elend as a Mistborn - What was the author thinking? Personally, I was not a big fan of Elend Venture and felt that Vin as a Mistborn could have carried the book alone. Elena's strengths were his mind and his logistical/administrative skills. By also making him a kickass Jedi Knight type character, Sanderson crammed too many qualities into one guy.<br /><br />Spook - you can pretty much skim through all of his chapters and not miss anything. I found this to be the second boring subplot of this book. What purpose did this character serve? His ultimate contribution to the story was negligible.<br /><br />Sazed's inner struggle - although I can appreciate his grief at losing the woman he loved, the author goes completely overboard with his internalizations about religion. It read like a cheesy evangelical drama about a broken man who found Jesus and became whole again...<br /><br />Horrible pacing- not much seems to happen for the first part of the book, but the the author bombards us with all of the convoluted back story about Ruin and Preservation as well as the various types of Magics and the complex intermingling.<br /><br />Atrocious dialogue - modern terms that don't have a place in fantasy. The author even used the word &#34;atheist&#34; at one point. I don't want to read a half-assed attempt at proselytizing, which is what most of Sazed's chapters read like (see above).<br /><br />Despite the flaws, Sanderson writes awesome action scenes and I was truly surprised at the individual that turned out to be the Hero of Ages. The ending was also satisfying and wrapped up the story really well.<br /><br />Bottom line, I get the feeling that Sanderson poured his heart and soul into The Final Empire (a fantastic book), but the sequels were rushed to cash in. WoA and HoA could have been condensed into one book.
B009O2XY12|5.0|this is a great game. very addictive but i love it. I start playing and have a hard time putting it down.
