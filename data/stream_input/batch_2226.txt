034580404X|4.0|Great books can't wait for the next series. Kept me guessing and intrigued. Also gave a much needed boost my imagination.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Great app for a dollar, I wish I would have gotten this one first! Very easy to use, fun editing options .  Better than some others out there spend the dollar, worth more
B000053VJI|5.0|Juan Luis Guerra, of the Dominican Republic, created music with great rhythm and also with lyrics that reflect the socio-political concerns of his country and South America. I loved &#34;Ojala que llueva cafe&#34; and tracks like &#34;Rosalia&#34; and &#34;Si tu te vas&#34;. The album reveals Juan Luis' talent and ability. Recommended.<br /><br />Juan Luis Guerra, de la Republica Dominicana, creaba una musica llena de buena ritmo y con letra que refleja las temas socio-politicos de su pais y de America del Sur. Me entusiasma canciones como &#34;Ojala que llueva cafe&#34;, &#34;Rosalia&#34; y &#34;Si tu te vas&#34;. El disco revela el talento y la habilidad de Juan Luis y por eso lo recomiendo.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love Bruno's creativity in his music. He brings something different that I absolutely love. If you haven't heard this album yet then check it out.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is an excellent read!!  Jack Reacher at his best.  No one but Lee Child can create a page turner before the main character even gets out of the car.  The characters were so vividly explained, they appeared to be real.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app. God's word on the go. plenty of translations.easy to use. easy to install. searcable data base. cool.
B0035Q4AFC|4.0|I really like this film.  Unfortunately, with many of Robert Downey Jr.'s recent works, one could forget that he was a tremendously talented artist.  This is one film that shows off his talents.  I use parts of this movie to show my U.S. History class the early days of film.  Be forewarned, despite its pg-13 rating, there is a scene in the movie showing a number of topless women in a changing room.  This can be easily skipped over with some planning.  The rest of the movie shows Chaplin as he ages through periods of social and technological changes in early to mid 20th century America.  The one fault of the film could be that it is a little long.
B00080ZG10|5.0|What can you really write about a movie? I purchased the movie because I liked it. Fast shipping came as described. Great value for the money.
B00942X8PY|2.0|Saw this a FAOTD. Don't I already have it (prior FAOTD, probably within 6 months)?  Why didn't I install it then? Either something about permissions - or something in reviews led me to &quot;get it but not install&quot; (maybe next version will be better?). So, today, we have update. Ask for &quot;network sockets&quot; - always &quot;red flag&quot; for me. My usual guideline: get ot, but don't install until/unless satisfied w tradeoffs. (This review should show &quot;Certified Purchaser&quot; (I believe) from last edition.
0525953728|5.0|This is a must read by all who have any interest in this field.<br />So well written, very informative and shocking.<br /><br />I loved this book and have bought  copies for friends and family.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best books I have read.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows!!! I loveeeeeeee it!!! I would recommend this 2 friends n family!!! Elementary 4ever!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed it and would have definitely given it five stars based on game play alone BUT I agree with other reviewers regarding full version. They wait until you're into the game and then advise you to go further you have to pay $5.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it. I hope everyone get one,it's the best I love it!!! You can do all types of things with your new kindle. If you don't have one get you one....go now...go
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best app out there. So much more useful than facebook. For the longest time, I have been wanting to make a collection of recipes, pictures of things etc that I want for future reference by cutting from magazines and organizing them in a folder but always had to put it off as it takes too much time! Pinterest made it possible for me and in a way that is so much easier! So if you have been wanting to organize your thoughts and dreams, this is the app for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game. It is completely worth the 7 dollars . The best part is that you get to create things. I would recomend this to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My six year old loves the game.  Very easy to play.  Promotional ads suddenly appeared at about level 15.  occasionally will have problems causing kindle to freeze.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I LOVE THE STORY LINE AND THE CHALLENGING LEVELS. The graphics and audio for this game are simply amazing. BEST MYSTERY GAME I EVER PLAYED I AM ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I book I have read time and again. I love the man in his entirety. He has overcome the forces of nature and ignorance to be one of the most influential figures in the music industry. If you love the music and love the idol himself, Read every page of this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|okay so I got this app for my b-day last month and it is &quot;THE BEST APP EVER&quot;I am in love with minecraft I do play creative a little but the best mode is survival but one thing I was mad about is that there is no pistons totally worth the $7
B009HEJXFS|5.0|If you're like me and thought MIB2 was wasted time you'll never get back, don't let that stop you from watching this. MIB3 was so funny, had a great story line and a twist at the end. It may even be better then MIB1. :o
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I now own the full series of Downton Abbey. Great series to watch over and over. Can't wait until the next season starts.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Really enjoyed this film.  Was also angered by it.  Moore hits it right on the head, however, that capitalism is an evil.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|We have watched the 2nd season and loved it, had to get the 1st season.  Jessica Lang is fantastic.  Each episode keeps you wanting more!!
B004PGO25O|3.0|Nice book. To the point and motivational but very informal writing. I didn't care for the slang used. Overall good.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I expected a terrific story and outstanding special effects. Well, I guess one out of two isn't too bad. Usually, in a good movie, you can identify with and either like or despise the characters. You should be able to find at least one character with whom you are sympathetic and root for to win. For me, this movie did not have one. This type of movie always demands the viewers suspension of disbelief. In this case, I never really believed in any of the characters or many of the situations. Especially, the lead female who ended the movie getting out of a surgical machine after having been cut open from one side to the other and then &#34;stapled&#34; back together who then proceeds to get out of the machine and except for a few contrived &#34;pain swoons&#34; function almost normally. The concern here is that the medical technology given for this operation was incredibly lacking in believeability. Really... staples?<br />And, for my final rant, what's with all of these blockbuster movies with &#34;stereo&#34; sound. Come on Amazon, would you have us believe that this thing was released in stereo and not 5.1? My 15&#34; subwoofer picks up the LFE channel, but no surround?? And you actually charge for this?
B004XQYBA2|4.0|Beats the PC game I bought on Steam, actually.<br /><br />So far, I've mainly played the standard games. The system runs quite smoothly, and any notations you make disappear on their own if that number's been added to its row/column/box. Seems to favor landscape mode, though either can be used.<br /><br />On the downside, it likes to flip around all over the place if you have your device at an angle instead of mostly landscape/portrait. I'm not sure what was up with color sudoku, but it's... well, not something I'll be touching again.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Fun movie with all of the right bangs, booms, and chase scenes. But, I grew up on Sean Connery's Bond. That Bond was smooth as cream, sophisticated, and at heart a gentleman. Craig's Bond is too rough around the edges and lacks the &#34;quality&#34; of most of the earlier Bonds. I also counted off points because of the stereo audio. Today almost everyone has surround sound audio with their cinema system and to provide only stereo sound certainly detracted from the immersive experience. All that said it was still a rolicking extravaganza of special effects that appeals to the kid in all of us!
B0034G4OVS|5.0|A very good movie. Suspenseful, horrifying, keeps u on the edge of ur seat. Deleted scenes, showed how they shot the movie in super cold weather.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Guys this is a good slender man app they add more maps to this game<br />so it doesn't get boring. great game
B007HC3LHS|4.0|What great read, could not put it down. would recommend Learned about OCD disorder, Loved when she conquered her fears, and did not turn her back on her friend.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Do Not Recommend! I can see other people's kids on my iPad more than half the time. It isn't instant on. Trying to turn on isn't easy. For $300, I expected more. I'll be returning this.
B003XRELGQ|3.0|This book was unlike any other I have read. Ironic, such stupidity, yet funny and thought provoking. I enjoyed the ride, never knowing where or why it was going there. Odd and interesting. I recommend.
B000N6UERK|5.0|We enjoyed the story line of this movie quite a bit.  Even though I kept up with the twists and turns of the plot, I'll definitely look forward to seeing it again.
1596912863|5.0|I read this book in one day. I simply love Pride and Prejudice and this was my first &#34;spinoff&#34; book, or Austenmania purchase. I was not disappointed! Although there were some parts where the main character did irk me a little bit, I couldn't stop turning the pages to see what happened next. For those that need a P&P fix, I recommend it!
B0089LOKHG|2.0|No ending just pulling down the wall.  It just ended.  I loved the first two books and could not wait to read this one.  Seriously it ended like that.  Almost like Mrs Oliver said Ok I got nothing I'm done.  What a waste.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My son loves it he adores horses and it teaches him about how to take care of an actual horse highly recommended
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I have seen all these movies and I like all of them. And it was shipped out right away to me
B000FBJAEG|3.0|The intersection of two stories is a real stretch. Too many, poorly defined, characters so it is easy to lose track of who is who (dead or alive).
B00B2064IY|4.0|I collect quite a bit of Jimi's work, but I tend to listen to a lot of his tunes that don't get a lot of airtime: Driving South, the live version of Stone Free, that sort of stuff. While this album has some pretty distinctive work, I don't know that I will be listening to it an awful lot. Even so, if you're a Hendrix collector, you should definitely have it as part of your collection.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A must read and a shocker of an ending!  Comparable to Kristin Hannah's winter garden!  An epic tale you won't put down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome!  And it is free.  You get to have your dream horse or horses.  I recommended this for all kids that love horses.  This is my favorite game!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|BESST MOVIE EVERRRRR! I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH! ITS FUNNY AND THE SINGING IS AWESOME!!! I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE
B008133MDK|5.0|Great that Amazon has video streaming.  This was a show we missed and it was easy to access the whole season.
B003TTH4IU|4.0|I have always liked the series but this is the first time that I was able to see the entire first series in its entirety.
6305128952|5.0|The movie was very well done. It was very sad and exciting. With some romance involved  Loved Robert Redford in the movie. I would recommend it for people who love horses, it's a touching story.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is the one thing that I was never able to play with any great skill as a child.  It is a nice grounding tool to remind me that everything is not sooooooo serious.
0547884591|4.0|I have not finished this book and do not want to unfairly penalize it on that basis.<br /><br />With respect to cooking:  Some of the techniques and recipes are quite helpful.  For a complete novice, its worthwhile to begin reading and you will learn some good techniques.  The recipes for relatively simple dishes like the steamed chicken with ginger-soy sauce is quite good.  I repeat it regularly.  The overall approach of narrowing every recipe down to 6 or fewer items, and actually picturing those items, is excellent.  I developed my own style of typing recipes in Excel in an easy to follow format (and taping them on the kitchen wall while I cook), so i found this effective.  You may not want to have the 3 inch thick book open while you are cooking, but the recipe format is much more effective that traditional cookbooks.<br /><br />Downside:  some of the recipes aren't good or just don't seem to work.  the coconut cauliflower mash was an absolute disaster.  Even doubling the amount of coconut milk left this a gross mess.<br /><br />If you are a busy professional and would like to learn some decent techniques and good go-to dishes to cook, I'd recommend this book.  even if you have some prior cooking experience, it will add efficiency to what you do.<br /><br />If you are a cooking purist, or critic/afficionado, then you'll probably piss all over many of the ideas herein.<br /><br />the '4 hour' branding is really just bookstore marketing technique - but the efficiency and methods are useful for taking an 80/20 approach to learning to cook.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game i ever play you gamer y'all should get this plus it free you don't got to ask for it cause it freeeeeee hope u buy it have fun<br /><br />  From best game ever<br /><br />  To people who don't have this game<br /><br />Ps best game ever event but it not better than super Mario bros 2
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|What? Yes this game is AWESOME! Compare Slender to A dragon that breaths special fire that makes  Everything- Eating zombies! And those zombies give birth to your scariest nightmare! Slender wins! Lil xD&hearts;
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I like the app cause it is easy to use.Your files are easy to acsess and to view every thing
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of my favorite books in years!  A truly unique love story with lots of suspense! A must read.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|With age indeed comes change. Typically in the music business the change is in the direction of a more jaded, repetitive, unemotional, professionally produced grind. Not so with Soundgarden. With age has come wisdom, talent, and their work has definitely stepped into the very rare world of true art. Maturity often comes at the expense of \\"soul,\\" but the heart is beating in these bad boys. Their entire collection is brimming with brilliance in many hues. Every release has been a masterpiece and each has been a step atypical for the genre.. hard-rock? grunge? They've been an inspiration to the entire modern musical community. This work has the same reverberating soul you find in everything they've done so far, but the years have polished their craft into genuine art. This is a full step above typical, and then some. I have a hard time hearing what's being said because it's being delivered on such a beautiful platter. Pay attention to this one, you'll be more than rewarded. \\"...I'm addicted to feeling...  I'm a ghost and a healer... I'm the shape of the hole inside your heart...  yes something is being said, and holy Hanna, what a magnificent listen. Amidst the tripe typically being served up today, this is an absolute sparkling beauty!! Thank you Soundgarden for the most magnificent revival I can remember. I pity the soul that can't connect to this one!
0393342212|5.0|I was suffering from the daily endless fight between my 10 year old daughter and 6 year old son before I bought this book when I was searching for the author's another book &#34;How to talk so kids will listen and how to listen so kids will talk&#34;. This book is tremendous help on dealing with their fights and most importantly, how to avoid these fights in the first place. I'm living a much happier life now...
B00A8ZZ570|5.0|This is the first solo work for ECM. Is a masterwork, is intensive , no easy to listen and very complex. The musician are great, all play in his biggest level. and Potter give a lesson of any kind of saxes . Never Potter play so well, his chops are incredible, and the composition are difficult to hear but unforgettable. The production is perfect. The only thing is that is very difficult to follow with only one audition. You must give time to time, and then you will understand how great is this Homeric music.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I grew up reading Stephen King so I like horror. The persons saying there is no objective the objective is to find and retrieve the 8 notes while also trying to stay away/run from Slender Man. Controls are mostly easy once you figure them out. Tip you can use 2 fingers at the same time anywhere on the screen. Slender Man himself is just a slender man dressed in black but scenery and all its pretty creepy! I have had fun with this so far!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app gives useful specific info about how long your Kindle's current charge should last for various uses. *Run the calibration for the different uses, for most accurate info.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Awesome service. Great movie and got it the very next day even though I didn't ask for next day air.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|I'm just generally not a TV watcher due to the largely formulaic and predictable 60 minute format, but this series keeps me coming back. Enjoyable story as for me, it harkens back to what made T 1 and 2 so successful. I felt those films were designed to create a sense of horror and suspense due to the notion of an uttterly implacable, emotionless and relentless enemy...they left you wondering 'how will she get out of this one?!' and this series taps some of the original thrill that was (to my mind) sacrified to special effects in the later films.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|For all the people who believe in second chances, who have faith that silver linings do exist...this is a must read!
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|this app is the worst app ever i tried to download my own music but it didnt work hate this app dont get it
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This series just keeps getting better! I love that there is so much interplay between the characters and that the books build on each other.
B0031FNYGS|5.0|I loved this as soon as I opened it and I knew my daughter would too.  The picture doesn't do it justice!  The wings are sparkly and it truly has a magical look about it.  I am very partial to the Schleich animal figures anyway!
B003U6BE8I|1.0|This movie is awful. I couldn't even finish watching it. The story barely holds together and the elements of the original story have been so dramatically altered as to make things unintelligible. There is little or not character development, Mostly its a series of cameos of high profile actors from scene to scene. I guess the thought was that these actors would carry the movie - problem is when no care is shown for the characters, story, or dialogue, there really is nothing to carry. Don't bother with this film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like it but I have to get 1,5000 points to win the whole entire game and be first in the scores!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Every time I had a problem they were days getting back to you.  I received a request to rate the customer care and a week later my game disappeared.  NO KIDDING.  I spend over 750.00 dollars on that game and was at the highest level with cash in bank and I had everything and more the game had and it is all gone.  4 days later I heard from them and they said I would have to start over there was NOTHING they could do.  RIGHT.  THEY ARE A RIPE OFF
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is absolutely the best. When I first started watching the quality was low, but after the computer adjusted it was PERFECT!!!!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|PLease read the book before you see the movie, and go to see the movie at a Cinema not on a small screen!  I found this story rivetting and was swept along with all the incredible lows and fascinating highs of this young man as he deals with survival against the elements, against a wild animals, and against his own mind. The movie was great but it is impossible to put everything from the novel into a movie and so if you read the book first it helps you undrestand everything the Director is trying to convey in his memorable images. The big screen gives you the visual impact to give this story justice. I was thinking about this book weeks and weeks after I finished reading it. That to me is a sign of a great read!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A perfect insight into military life and it's internal struggles. I could not put it down. A true American hero.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Read all 3 books.  Full of intrigue and good old detective work, journalism and computers. Highly recommended for all types of readers.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This film is VASTLY over rated.  I thought P. T. Anderson's \\"Magnolia\\" was a tour-de-force.<br />On the other hand, walked out of this film feeling in need of a mental enema.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix as Freddie Quell rambles through the film gaunt, hunched over and generally acting deranged.<br /><br />Bad, really bad.
1580084621|5.0|I lived in Thailand and seldom find food in restaurants that I like.  Only tried one recipe so far but found it very authentic, but usable in an American kitchen.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Have trouble with it working correctly in my GalaxyIII. Will try again. I need something to take mind off a problem that I solving and leaves my brain to solve the problem in the back ground.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Such a great show!! Takes a few episodes to suck you in but its really good and only gets better and better!!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Great - really enjoy the news and how it works. Can check the headlines quickly and go futher in depth of what I wanted.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Free game application using Amazon.com download, this is a very entertaining game that can be used on our Kindle Fire
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Super Spiel für schnellen Zeitvertreib. Einfache Handhabung. Störend ist nur immer wieder die Werbung... aber dafür ist es ja kostenlos.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch and really kept our attention. I would recommend it highly. A little long but worth watching!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I am absolutely in the love with this trilogy.  It's a must read!  Can't wait for the second movie to come out!
1609611543|3.0|Not exactly what I thought.  It is not my favorite book, but it is very in depth about wheat and grains
B00007BKVC|5.0|This movie reminds me of a side of me  have never explored. There is a bad girl inside me that longs to go on an adventure and go out in a blaze of glory. With this movie I have.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|This book kept you wanting to read more as the characters kept adding more people into the possible guilty.  The writer kept you guessing what the multiple players had in common.  Will definitely read more by this author.
B00004XPPC|5.0|This movie shows how pride can lead a man to do the wrong thing at the wrong time and how others will blindly follow.
B003WJQ74E|4.0|I wish I had read this at a younger age. It sparked great discussion between my boyfriend and me about what the book made us think.
1435106342|5.0|This is a beautiful edition, magnificently presented at a very affordable price. Poe is for &#34;Poetry&#34;. I am very proud to have it in my library at home.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|it is soft porn and the amount of sex in the book takes away from the actual  story. the story is a bit immature but I did manage to read all 3 books....for whatever that is worth.
0937381888|5.0|The only issue is the author knows nothing about plumbing.  His description on how to build a mash tun had an incorrect parts list.
B004UPANAI|1.0|I prefer these movies over comedies and romances because both comedies and romance movies I have found I can predict 99% of the jokes in comedies, and in romances, I know the ending within the first 5 minutes of the movie. But, just because I want something more exciting doesn't mean that I want gory and evil.<br /><br />Can not the authors make something exciting without also including violent and gory scenes? Are they really that incapable? I believe that authors are capable of making exciting without explicit gore or sex, and I challenge them to not be so lazy as to move right from boring to evil.<br /><br />I know there are a lot of people out there like me who have no genre of movie that appeals to them wholeheartedly, so they (I) watch these types of movies because there are no alternatives. It is a disappointment that all of these millions of dollars to make a movie, and they don't have higher expectations of their authors. I have higher expectations of a toddler that these movies do of their authors. I believe that these authors are capable of a higher level of intelligence and creativity.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I started playing Minecraft on the computer but then I started playing this version (Kindle Fire) and I got used to it. Very good app.
B002LANLDK|1.0|It would be nice if we could have both exciting, and avoid the violence and sexual scenes. I have a very difficult time finding a movie that embodies these qualities.<br /><br />It seems that if a movie avoids outrageous violence and sexuality, they move right to predictable and boring. This type of opposite ends of the spectrum shows a lack of creativity in my point of view.<br /><br />If you need to move right to violence in order to be interesting, perhaps that also shows a lack of intelligence? Not trying to criticize, just saying that I do expect more out of authors because I believe they are capable of more. I think that they move right to violence and sex to make the movie interesting out of laziness on their part. We need to move the bar up a little more, I expect more out of what should be the top writers in the country.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Of course it's a love story, but has a mystery weaved into the story.  I did enjoy the read and always the easy reads from Sparks.
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|I like Liam as an action guy, and if you don't guess where this story is going from the beginning -- I didn't -- it is worth seeing.  The plot is well within bounds of what you expect in an action movie, and has a great cast.  Some critics panned it, but I think it is better than many new films, and as good as the Bourne series, which I also like.<br /><br />Now to Amazon's problem with Aspect Ratio.  This blu-ray is listed by Amazon as &#34;1.77:1.&#34;  No, it is 2.4:1.  The box says so and that's the way it plays on my player and TV.  I assume someone at Amazon read only the part that said 16x9, which should read &#34;ENHANCED FOR 16x9.&#34;  Yes, I told Amazon a week ago, but they haven't responded.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Good time killer. The 3d is cool. Wish there was different cube options though. It does tend to make me wish I could compete against others.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I do not usually write reviews, especially on this machine. But I did enjoy this book after my daughter recommended it to me. I look forward to the rest of the books. It is a classic good guy vs bad guy book, but with a different twist. Hope you start racking it in, but please don't let go to your head, and loose touch with your natural skills as a writer.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I read the first book, City of bones and love it! i cant wait to read the rest of the series
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The 3D is incredible!!! The clarity and the sound... I felt like I was in a theater, except it was more clear.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This book was amazing. It is no surprise that it won the National Book Award. It was a refreshing change from so many other novels I have read with predictable plots and one-dimensional characters.
B00138KJY0|5.0|This is one of his best albums. It,s  &#34;Off the wall&#34;.  I've YOU listen to it it will be difficult for you to put it down.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|Maybe to some, the problems experienced by the main character don't seem big enough to drive someone into a depression. But that is what depression (not deep sadness) is like. If you haven't experienced it, then good for you. You have no idea how fortunate you are.<br />Loved this book.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|At first this story reminds me of a cross between Alice in Wonderland and Harry Potter..this other dimension. As I read I am pulled in with curiosity about this place, why is Owe, the main character, seeing it, has something happened to his brain? What is Everville? Who are The Keepers and the Fron? Little eyes & big ears...I assume they are ok, but it is the evil that is trying to take over Everville that concerns me. Owen is somewhat likened to Luke Skywalker when he is introduced to the &#34;Force&#34; and can't acquire it in my opinion.<br /><br />Friendship is an underlying theme that keeps Owen going with his two friends, Dante & Anika. They appear to be willing to be a part of something strange but do they know of what?<br /><br />The learner device gives Owen knowledge of what The Keeper has gone through and is somehow suppose to equip him to defeat the evil, Them and  The Other In Between.<br /><br />&#34;The room was like a living organism.&#34;? What does this mean? It grows with the number of Frons. And is he capable of changing as needed . How can he help?<br /><br />What's the breach? Will he find out in time?  The balance in Everville  is not right but Owen has no idea what this means?<br /><br />Owen, a college student continues telling the story and goes between reality & real life, but has a concern for Everville. He can will himself to the spiritual realm of Everville at first, then physically. People are able to give strength from themselves to others in this fantasy, sometimes at their own peril.  Battles are fought and challenges are made.<br /><br />Owen and his friends are involved in a competition that may save Everville and it's eight realms. It moves fast and you have to continue to stay with the characters as they change realms. It's an adventure just unraveling before your eyes. I would have liked a little more explanation of some of the places and things that were happening but all in all it was a great adventure. I'd look forward to another sequel. Hopefully the next one is better edited. The spelling and grammar made it a little confusing but didn't strop me from reading it.

B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I read all the reviews on this game and thought I'd give it a shot-now I'm writing my first review ever in 2 years because this game is just that bad. It is a little scary at first when you see Slender Man a few times, then gets ridiculous if you get closer to him as he now will have stupid spider legs sticking off his back *eyeroll*. Anyway, I kept playing and after three separate times of getting 7 of 8 notes I would just walk into thin air, literally!  So frustrating! You'll be walking along and you fall through the ground and now you're floating among stars and you have to quit and start a new game. Some people love this game, it just isnt for me I guess.
0062197266|5.0|My NEW favorite writer!  This is the best book I've read in a while- and this author has 2 others which I purchased for delivery as soon as possible.  Domestic Violence and Stalking are not somethng I have personal experience with, thank goodness; but I do have some small insights into PTSD and OCD, and I thought all of the psychological spects of this book were spot on.  It's beautifully written.  It's interesting- and this Author's voice is original.  At 397 pages, to me it was not long enough.  I panicked as I was getting down to the end; knowing that it would be days before my next Elizabeth Haynes book arrived from Amazon.  I love books set in the UK; and this is certainly no exception.  I really felt as though I ere on Cathy's journey; and kept thinking about the book on the rare occasions I had to put it down; and am thinking about it still.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I am enjoying this game. There is plenty of color and breeding the dragons is easy. I like that you can GIFT each other gold.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved the first season......and season two was even better! It is a a great show the whole family can enjoy.  I am hooked!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's SO fun! I'm addicted! :)<br />I love to play it, and its a good way to know how to take care of a horse, minus all of the hard physical work! :)<br />AWESOME!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I remember watch this show as a kid boy it has come a long way. Extremely entertaining I am hooked. I am watching all the new series in order and catching up to the current series.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best hard sci fi's I've ever read.  Though I too nearly gave up after the first (foul) word, I nonetheless ploughed dubiously onward, and was soon mesmerized.  (Who ARE you Andy Weir?  Why isn't your name up there with Asimov and Hogan?)  After that I couldn't put it down.  Then I realized the last line justified the first - who wouldn't spout obscenities in The Martian's situation!  I recommend this book to anyone who loves pure science fiction.
B0030A0ZD4|2.0|I ordered it, recalling fond memories watching it as a child. I suppose nostalgia tinted it rosy, because it's not nearly as entertaining as I remember. It's often boring. It could use a lot more music. Though the smooth criminal scene still resonates, the rest is full of some sub-par songs and downtime.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It kept my attention. It really gave a look into a loving, yet somewhat dysfunctional family, especially the father and how each of family member copes in their own way with life's strives. You've got to admire the main character because he really does want to get well even if it's for the wrong reasons at first.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game !!!I would recommend this game to any horse lover.It is a great game for kids any age.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|No point to this game once the puzzles are completed, what about this idea add more. I was excicted to see there was an update to the game today but only to be let down,the whole thing was just another attempt to get us to spend more money rather than making it more fun you did the opposite not only that but you're lousy update added more lag to the coins dropping and when you push yes to exit the game the yes starts flashing at you then it exits. I know that with 250k plus tokens and hundreds of prizes already the last thing i need is to buy you're half price tokens or you're treasure chest full of prizes what i do need at level 312 of the game is more puzzles come on guys lets be creative rather than greedy i promise you in the end you will make more money!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing story!  It took my breathe away.  I actually felt sad when it was over.  I can't wait for more books by this author.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Just when I thought the movie was bad the book is worse! This book is cheaper than most popular books for a reason, I won't be reading the rest of the series, I would not recomend this to anyone, save your money!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I absolutley love this book! It kept me in suspense throughout the whole thing! I can't wait to read the rest of the series!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|THIS BOOK IS EPIC READ IT, READ IT NOW, YOU'RE NOT READING IT!<br />NOW READ IT NOW! READ IT NOW!
B00AAX68HG|2.0|I loved Cut the Rope by ZeptoLabs and had high hopes but it feels like you spend almost as much time skipping ads as you do playing the game.  Fun game though, kind of on the easy end, but not worth it for me with the ads.  Would consider the ad free one if the price is reasonable.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great app! I love how you can download more puzzles, there are so many to choose from and you can get a lot of them free!! I like how you can choose the difficulty level. The photographic quality of the puzzles they give you are good.when you look in the store for downloads not all of them are as nice but the majority of them are. Any puzzle that isn't free is only 99&cent; for a pack of six or sometimes more. The only problems I've ever had is once when I wanted to finish a puzzle I had been working on earlier, I went back to finish it and it wasn't there. Also when I first enter the app instead of the menu popping up there would just be a black screen. I found out that if I pressed the back button on my kindle it would take me to the menu. Besides those two things I've never had any problems. And it works great on my KINDLE, never crashes or freezes or anything :)
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I have such respect for this group. They don't go for the cheap thrill, they have a turn of phrase in their lyrics that I haven't come across in a long time and they treat their fans with such personal attention! Yes I can say this for a fact cause I had the opportunity to catch them at a meet and greet before a show and they are some of the nicest people I have ever met.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|It was about four years ago when a friend recommended me watching The Shield. I was never able to watch every episode and was not sure  what season I was in. Now with The Shield  on Amazon I can see why this friend recommended this show to me all those many years ago. It's about police corruption, and other police trying to reign in that disruptive and criminal activity from their fellow law enforcement officers.<br /><br />I highly recommend the show, and I believe most people will enjoy this action-packed series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much fun. really good graphics, too. It can be challenging, which is really nice for people who like that sort of stuff. my friend and I always try to beat each others scores, and that is a fun thing to do. all in all this is a really good game! would like more characters though.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|No wonder this dog never made it to the big screen. Couldn't make it past the first 30 minutes. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|You open the program and check out which category you want and wham! A new ebook from a whole lot of books. I mean a whole lot! Pretty neat, eh?
B00BBW16HW|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Highly recommend. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Highly recommend.
B00024I0OC|5.0|Way ahead of its time and as relevant today as it was some 40+ years ago. Romantic, frantic, absorbing, exciting and beautifully executed. If you haven't heard it just buy it. If you love the band then you won't be disappointed, the suite was probably there finest moment.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a new writer this much since I found Greg Bear. Well-matched plot, characters, and description of a world you can live in, escape to for a few hours. And so hard to put down.<br /><br />Thanks, Hugh
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|because he has such a beautiful voice, and David Foster has added so much to the music... He truly is a gifted man...
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It is adorable! I laughed so hard when it replayed my drawings! It did take me awhile to realize that I could make my drawing line thicker or thinner and use color. The options to draw are a bit difficult, but it is still a lot of fun.
B000T433L0|1.0|We rented this because it had great reviews, great actors, and bitchin cover. This movie sux harder than a porn star. I started off really slow, then  out of no where near the end he goes postal, gets away with it , and gets looked at as a hereo???? i rated it a star because i had no option of no stars .
B003TSEEDY|5.0|i love emma watson!  the other stars are just as wonderful!  emma made a great choice for her first post harry potter movie!
B009NX88JU|2.0|wasnt what i expected. was expecting more chaos, crazy party scenes, more experimentation from the kid but it was mild, and the ending sux!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|i have seen this movie in the theater.  this movie tells how one of the key events in the iran hostage situation happened that wasn't public knowledge until the clinton administration.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I don't understand the negative reviews, I really liked this movie I thought it was really good. Denzel's performance was great.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|its a lot of fun to play this game it os also scary though so if you play this game look out for slenderman
0517591812|5.0|I first bought this book in 1997 and have purchased all of Mr. Rutherfurd's books.  They are both interesting and a really good read.  I purchased this one for my daughter.  I still have my copy and hope to read it again soon.  I loved &#34;Sarum&#34;, his Irish two and New York.  Am looking forward to &#34;Paris&#34; next month.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game I llooovvveeee it lol :D I just hate it wen he kills me wen I'm just about to pass it awwww!!!.... but still I love it :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read it! Read it! Read it! Once you start, you won't stop.  Can't say a lot without giving too much away, but there is more going on than what's in the silo!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really like the app,  AccuWeather for Android.  the graphics are nice.  It is easy to use and has lots of weather information other than the temperature.  Especially like the feature that shows the temp at the top every 10 minutes while you are using your device.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|Can watch this movie over and over.  Great music and dance. Love the plot and the acting. Great costumes and haircuts!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Futuristic sci-fi with a cowboy theme, what's not to like? Loved every episode and the movie. Awesome! Only downside... Just one season :-(.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was looking for something different to read.  I selected this book based on reviews.  I was not disappointed.  This was an awesome book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is very adorable. It's very simple and easy to understand. It's addictive for the old and young people.
B009G78EE2|5.0|couldn't believe the price for this, and yes its the original explicit version. itunes has it for something like 11.99, so this was a total steal. quality is fine.
B004IOVGW0|3.0|Much of the script is stylized from the 1950&#34;s and is full of cliche's.  There are a few scenes when everything is good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an addictive series that we are late getting into, but we are now caught up. It is an interesting period that makes me wish I was more of a historian buff. It is filled with intrigue, romance and you find yourself caught up in the many intertwining relationships.<br />We can't wait for season four.
B009G3T01M|3.0|Obviously they are a novelty act.  There are a few catchy songs & it's worth the $3.99 Amazon was asking for it.  Not worth full price.<br />Thank you Amazon for offering &#34;albums&#34; for discounted prices.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 4 year old daughter loves having a horse to take care of. Perfect no mess pet!! Easy to play and plenty of interaction with the player and the horse.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I would recomend this book to anyone who is a Scarpetta fan or even a new fan to be hooked by Scarpetta's way of drawing the reader into the cases she's working on. I loved it!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|As everyone else has already stated, the first three books were incredible...seriously, they were genius.  A Feast for Crows was entertaining, if somewhat slow in parts. However, A Dance With Dragons seemed to have a stagnate plot. I finished the book thinking \\"that's it?\\" It wasn't that the entire thing was slow or boring, but the problem, as others have already mentioned, was the introduction of seemingly irrelevant characters that did nothing to advance the story line. Another problem with these new characters is that it made the story hard to follow. They would show up, do virtually nothing, only to never appear again or only appear briefly. I wish more was focused on the original characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the Arya and Cersi chapters, although they were few and far between. Dany's story line was almost a chore to read in some parts. Anyway, long story short, and trying not to repeat what others have already stated, this was far too long and introduced far too many characters which made it hard to follow. The book should have been about 400-500 pages as opposed to 1000.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|would be perfect if it wasnt for huge ad at bottom of clock. works fine otherwise. maybe in future we could be able to change color of display.
1444737112|5.0|I loved this book and the story it told. Bob is a special cat and everyone should read his story
B00770KR7W|5.0|This figure is the greatest hero for a little boy going through his Halo obsession phase.  I myself don't understand the obsession with Halo, but as my son tells it, Master Chief is the best and absolutely amazing.  He loves this toy.  Master Chief keeps him entertained for hours.  He is hardy and durable, more so than some other toys he's had an obsession with (transformers anyone).  I have no complaints.
B0017TFLBQ|2.0|I sure thought and expected it to be the same as the older MM-III, nope. You cant \\"Roll up a Crew\\", etc. I didn't go further as it didn't resemble New Age Computing's MM-III. I think the young at heart that never played N/A/C's MM-III won't know the difference tho. I gave Mine to \\"Helping Hands\\".
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|The aspect ratio of this blu ray is not 1.77:1 it is 2.4:1, meaning there is black bars while watching the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is totally addicting. A lot of  games try to copy it, but it isn't as great as temple run! I just wish there was more characters to pick from. But other than that , it's fun. Please make temple run 3!
B00B8BR6CU|5.0|Wonderful feel good period piece which I am sure is I'm no way historically accurate but is what you would hope it would have been. Great acting with a great script.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enjoyed the characters, setting, costumes, history, actors and the story line.... Just couldn't wait for the next episode of each season.  Waiting anxiously for season 4 to begin.
B007FKI9G0|5.0|This movie is \\"one louder in many ways lol\\" after you watch it that will make more sense to you. If you lived in the early metal days or not you'll still find it funny.
B00136NUG6|5.0|You cant go wrong with a great band.  The funk lives on- baby.  I am feelin' the groove- just in time for the concert in May!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great series.  For anyone who is fan of the TV show should read all the books first, they are a little long but give so many details that any movie or series couldn't that is makes you enjoy the series so much more.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I just bought this app just yesterday yes I love the game but wish I knew it was gonna be free before then
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|Good read fast paced with plenty of action and intrigue.kept me interested and not wanting to lay it down.I would definitively recommend this book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was ok but the games where old so you need diffrent games and the games where easy so change that to
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I was kind of skeptical when I downloaded it because of some of the reviews, but this is a really neat app. Wish I could use it on the computer though because it saps the battery quickly. I understand some of the reviews now. You eventually get to the point where you have to spend real $ on the game. It's annoying and kind of jerkish. I mean as soon as you reach the level that you can have the underwater park, the only way to search for things is to send out the subs. The free one only lets you collect 1 item and it's usually 100 coins of 50 xp points. Then it shows the other 2 compartments of the sub of what you could have gotten if you used your bucks. Of course that's where you find the other species. The only way to get the species is to PAY 99 bucks! ridiculous. I'm actually getting sick and tired of this game. Also when evolving your dino, it sometimes fails and you have the option to start over or pay a buck to retry (even that isn't guaranteed).
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Interesting to see all of the hidden dangers of the food industry. Definitely makes you think about where your food is coming from.
B003DBOS7Y|4.0|Not one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks movies.  But if you like those types of movies you will not be dissappointed.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can go where ever i want to and it is really simple to creep on friends and family alike
B00942X8PY|4.0|Not a bad game, similar in some ways to Flow.  The art work is very minimal, but it has grown on me.  The puzzles are entertaining and if you enjoyed flow or flow bridges you'll enjoy this one as well.  It seems to work well on my Kindle Fire HD.  On the other hand it doesn't really do anything new or different.  For the free app of the day, it is a decent deal.
B00A757EFW|4.0|it is a very nice game but is a little difficult to navigate on a small screen.played the game a lot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|you need to get this game! it is awesome. I got this game right when I herd of it.and I never will regret it.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|I dislike it very much. i have erased it from my kindle because of the difficulty of trying to negotiate the maps
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love to browse through all the topics and choose the ones I am interested in listening to. The talks are really good and the speakers they choose to present the material are top line.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|i use the app for work every day checking before i take a road trip no matter where i go
B000002O4X|5.0|Loved the movie and love listening to this music when I'm in the mood.  Glad it's out on CD.  Great.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This app isn't worth it. In my opinion I think that Survival Craft is more fun plus its only like 4 dollars. The only reason I got this game was because my friends were like,&quot;it cool and you should get it. It's a really neat game&quot; but when I bought it. It just sucks. So I give it one star because there is a better game than this......Survival Craft
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|Great recording of a great artist. Product arrived ontime and packed well so no damage would occur. Enjoying every minute of it.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Considering all the hype, I expected this film to blow me away. I so wanted it to, but it didn't. It seemed to lack that playful/devilish Bond style. It was very serious and a bit on the grim side. Daniel Craig as Bond seemed kind of robotic most of the time.<br /><br />Other than that, the villain had good motivation. I thought it interesting how it was all about killing M. The action was fun. The opening had a surprise. There were plenty of action/fight scenes. I'd say this was one of the most sophisticated Bonds as far using technology in the plot.<br /><br />The plot was weak at times. For example, I can't imagine anyone with M's experience making the mistake of using a flashlight in the dark just so the bad guy could find her.
B007OTZ654|5.0|Brings back grea memories,  I only had the LP verssion,so now I can listen any time I want, lookiing forward to gettig his new CD.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|This is just a fun, sing-along movie, with great songs from the hair bands of the 80s/90s. Don't look for depth of plot here. Look for good, mindless, bond with your friends fun. Be pleasantly surprised by the fact that there is a plot to tie the music together. The acting? Looks like they had a good time filming! If you're not a Russell Brand fan, you're just not a fan yet. And if you're over Tom Cruise, he may redeem himself a bit here. Alec Baldwin? Hilarious! Mary J. Blige - she brings the singing talent. Julianne Hough - got a little Meg Ryan adorable going on here.<br /><br />Just have fun with this movie. And wine.
B007TK77QE|4.0|For me, this novel was a style merger of Barbara Trapido and Irvine Welsh - cosy intensity with a grounding in the gritty underworld. JK Rowling or no JK Rowling, I liked it a lot and am pleased to have read it. And given its size and weight in paper, I am even more pleased that I read it on Kindle.
B001I45UFC|5.0|great book for young readers. i love it! IT encourages people to be engrossed in a wonderful tale full of mystery and adventure. A real page turner.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was on my list of must reads for quite a while. I finally bought it on my Kindle Fire and literally read it in one day. While it was somewhat what I expected with the Red room and such, there was more of an actual story than I thought and I was very pleased. I gave it 5  stars because I literally could not stop reading it!  I can't wait to read the second one.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|An excellent hi definition classic! Fun for all and the color and detail is amazing. The disc worked fine in both of my players one being a PS3.
1451683405|1.0|Can't believe he wrote it and had the audacity to sell it for money!<br />The whole book is so just an incoherent presentaion of totally senseless argument.<br /><br />I would like my money back or get another book (better written, of course) for free.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book has everything.  I am not a lover of so called chick lit and had purchased this book for some light reading while on holidays. Between one thing and another I never got to read it and it has sat on my kindle for a long time. My mistake. I loved this book so much that I'm now trying to decide which of JoJo Moyes books I will read next.<br /><br />Me Before You is all about Loving, Laughing and Living and it totally sucked me in and stayed with me when finished,  I laughed till I cried, I cried till I started laughing again.<br /><br />A wonderful read that I have no hesitation recommending. Enjoy!
075666733X|2.0|The detail is of course superb. The way the anatomy illustrations are proportioned is very useful for teaching. The 3D aspect enables visualization of the anatomical layers and relation of organs and supporting structures to each other.<br /><br />However I was hoping for a detailed description and illustration of the male prepuce for use in pre-natal teaching. Many parents in North America are swayed by myth and superstition as well as demonizing of the prepuce and receive pressure to allow circumcision of their infant sons. They need good illustrations of the prepuce to reassure them they need not be manipulated by  this negativity. It was quite a surprise indeed to find a book on human anatomy from the UK omitting any illustration or reference to the prepuce! Continued scrutiny of The Complete Human Body yielded no other omissions to my knowledge.<br /><br />Illustrations of female genitalia are excellent, no omissions noted. One hopes those who teach parents in countries where female genital mutilation are practiced will use this resource among others in educating parents and elders to eschew all forms of female genital cutting.<br /><br />I hope DK will complete its excellent preliminary study of male genitalia including the prepuce and place it as an addendum to the book. The best information on anatomy and physiology would come from J. R. Taylor et al the British Journal of Urology Volume 77, February 1996 77:291 - 295 and Volume 83, Suppl. 1: Pages 34-44,<br />January 1999; the physiology from Dr Morris Sorrells et al British Journal of Urology International Volume 99: Pages 864-869, April 2007.<br /><br />I believe there are also many online resources describing and illustrating the anatomy and functions of the foreskin. It is relatively new as Taylor's study was the first to describe the prepuce in detail, actually the first original anatomy published in close to 150 years.<br /><br />Thank you for an otherwise wonderfully dynamic educational resource.
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|Such a charming movie.  Love it that the drawing comes alive!  Zellweger and Mcgregor are great in this movie.  After all these years, the books are able to enchant children.  My three year old can quote passages from the book by heart.
B008EEWN6I|5.0|Those missing the days of System of a Down will love this. More edgy than previous Serj albums, but not as hard as SoaD. Very poetic, as expected. Love it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES. iT'S A BEAUTIFUL STORY AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SIT DOWN AFTER WORK TO WATCH THE NEXT EPISODE. I LOVE ALL THE PEOPLE LIVING N THE HOUSE AND THE RELATIONSHIP THEY SHARE. IT'S A RELAXING SERIES AND NO STRESS AFTER WORKING ALL DAY. EACH EPISODE LEAVES ME WAITING TO WATCH THE NEXT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
0425263908|5.0|I have read 50 Shades of Grey and loved it. I was looking for something similar and found it with this series. To be totally honest, I loved this book so much more then 50 Shades of Grey. I can not wait till the third book comes out and would hate to see it end with that book...I can read about Gideon and Eva forever, love their story so far!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|be very cool if u could hear slenders footsteps. anyway plz add elementary as a map.<br />pretty scary. I think it is better than the PC version.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good book, but I wish the author went into their lives after \\"I love you\\" want to know more! Please!
B005BQNC44|3.0|As I read I could barely believe that what I was reading was fact and not fiction. What Jaycee Dugard went through was just so horrific that it took me a long time to get the visions of her suffering out of my head. I pray that she truly finds  peace in her life and the strength to rare her two daughters.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Amazing game I am so obsessed it is so much fun I guess I feel like it is addicting go hOrses
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|chucked full of good information.  letters are easy to read. price is right.  compare price to barnes and noble.  easy to carry
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|I had misgivings about this film when I chose it from Neftflix, though I am glad I rented it. The film is well-done, much better than you might think it is. The subject matter is done tastefully, though for mature audiences only, please.<br />The male lead, portrayed by two different actors of which one is Ralph Fiennes is a s***! You'll have no trouble hateing him: the guy is a coward. Winslet does a fantastic job in the female lead. This is an entertaining and touching film. It will make you laugh and cry. Overall, I highly recommend everyone see this film at least once.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|dont miss this series. looking forward to season 4.  this has a surprise ending.  Maggie Smith is great.  whole cast is good.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app offers a very user-friendly interface and many many station choices. The sound is perfectly listenable in almost every case. Recordings and live stations are indicated clearly so the listener gets what is expected. Since I have not tried many other radio apps, I do not have a lot to compare it to, but it seems quite acceptable to me..
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|never could get it to load where i could use it.  didnt like the favorite part either.  will try later
B009G41CG2|3.0|This program performs very well. The only exit seems to be to simply return to \\"Home\\", but since that works fine and the state of a game in progress is saved when that exit is chosen, I suppose it's not  a problem. Also, this game does allow the player to increase the size of the view which is helpful when comparing some of the more lookalike tiles. I still haven't figured out which are the seasons tiles and which are the plants tiles as some of the designs are pretty ambiguous, so, again, I would prefer the traditional design. For such a nicely programmed Mahjong game to be free is a real plus. There is a tiny ad in the upper left hand corner (in my copy it is for Hulu) that displays constantly, but it is not obtrusive and is useful information, so it is certainly not annoying in a free app. Overall, I'd call this a bargain. One caveat is the tile design for which I withheld one star. The other and more annoying fault is that the game does not signal or quit when all possible matches have been made. That is a much more annoying fault and costs the game a second star, especially when it is so hard to identify the seasons and plants tiles.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I really enjoyed it.  This series just gets better with each book.  No character is safe which makes it very suspenseful.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Very good movie although I know the story and the outcome.<br />Lots of untruths and best picture at the Oscars ? I beg to differ.<br />Worth watching
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! I am still one of those old fashioned people that still maintains a check register and this app really makes it easier.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy is a must to read-only it was hard to put down once I started. The author is quite adept at weaving a story that leaves you breathless and highly anticipating the next scene!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Turns out to be a really good story.  More a love story than a provacative read.  I would reccommend this book
0307352153|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It helped me to better understand what being and Introvert really meant and the positive aspects of  being one in this world that values Extroverts.  I would recommend it to Introverts as well as Extroverts who have Introverts in their lives (child or adult ones).
B007IXWKUK|5.0|the 2nd in the series - very much kept my attention going - especially after the first one!  The story takes some turns and I would reccommend this book
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If the psychology of the human condition is your thing, and if you abhor poitical meddling then be prepared for righteous anger. I love it when a novel can do this...A superb series that I read cover to cover through the whole series! Cant wait for the grand finale...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very fun reading - kept my attention for the entire book - couldn't wait to get to book two after reading book 1!  Well worth the time to read and be entertained!
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|this game was stupid. you go around collecting signs.and he pops up like every 10min. And he is so easy to get away from
B00B2V66VS|5.0|sometimes it has glitches but the game over all is fun. the graphics are amazing. if ur looking for a fun game. stop looking and download temple run 2
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is great. its so addictive you can't  put it down.really makes you think about the laws of gravity.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so fun but I wish you could chat or send mail with friends but other than that it rocks!!!<br /><br />  -NIcole-
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I get to level 2 and it says to download the dark forest but it just freezes on that screen and won't let me play the game anymore. I end up having to shut down kindle fire hd and turn it back on just to be able to play the first level. However once I get up to level 2 I get the same problem!!! I don't want to have glitches with games I have to pay for especially when the originals are free!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wow....what a show!!!! Can't wait for the new season!! I love the characters!!! The perfect amount of drama!!  Even if Matthew leaves the show.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nice distraction game. Designed very well and functions flawlessly. Ad version isn't annoying and they don't continuously hit you up to buy ad ons. The options are there but it isn't all in your face the whole time you are playing.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Surprisingly fun and addictive.  Couldn't imagine how such a simple .game could be so addictive but I can't stop playing
B006PIXKVW|5.0|Charming story of a father-daughter relationship and the power of imagination and courage. Every actor is brilliant. This is one title that belongs on the movie-shelf of every young girl because it portrays a &#34;true&#34; little princess: a courteous and globally kind young lady.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Pixar is so cool.  Really enjoyed the story and characters were endearing.  This is a good movie to add to your collection.
0061733199|5.0|This book covers a LOT!  I will be enthralled by the material for some time.  Book marks a plenty.<br /><br />The construction is top notch.  Thick pages with color.  I mention color because that drastically helps when identifying plant life.<br /><br />I consider the size to be perfect.  Fits into any day pack or bug out bag.<br /><br />I would gladly pay the difference if the author and publisher would re-produce this book in a weather proof edition.  Until then, gets a zip lock bag for protection.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this Bible is very helpful also my mom owns a shop named Christ Creations in Stafford tx 2827 north main.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It is just okay.  it get boring real fast.  It is not a game that you would want to play very long
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I totally love this app. so fun and easy to work with.  download into your Galley and begin; that easy.  Can't wait for more frames styles to come out,  always checking. But get this app. you will really enjoy it.
B006RJTIF6|5.0|That is the question posed by this movie.  It also tests the saying about how all that is needed for evil to succeed, is for good men to do nothing.<br /><br />Burt Lancaster as 4-Star General James Matoon Scott, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Kirk Douglas as the straight-shooting, law abiding Marine Colonel who works as Gen. Scott's aid.  The Colonel finds out about the plot quite by accident.<br /><br />What is especially interesting is a particular decision the characters in the film made with respect to HOW they would stop the coup and the one method they decided not to use unless or until it was shown that there would be no other way.<br /><br />For some reason, seeing this movie always makes me want to watch &#34;Advise and Consent&#34; immediately afterwards.<br /><br />Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas did not make many movies together.  In fact, I believe this is only one of two or three in which they did.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Tense, action well done movie. For adults only. Not for kids. Ben Affleck did a great job both directing and acting.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you read 50 shades then I strongly suggest this for one of your next reads. I like to think of this as the older sibling to 50 Shades. Although I loved both series, this one seemed to have more &#34;grown up&#34; story line, where 50 was like Twilight on porn.
160774273X|5.0|I purchased Ken's book and jumped into the \\"how-to's\\" of making bread just like any good kid with ADHD, because that is what interested me. Flour, Water, Salt and Yeast by Ken Forkish leaves one with three options:  1) invest some money and make excellent artisan bread, 2) get frustrated and not make bread because of the cost or 3) get creative and solve problems.  I searched Habitat for Humanity Stores and yard sales and found 2 cast iron Dutch ovens for under $25.00 total though it took a bit of time.  I used large plastic bowels we use for popcorn to mix dough then covered them with a large dinner plate.  Later I proofed it in Pyrex mixing bowls with a cloth dishtowel inside.  When I was on vacation, I purchased 2 proofing baskets at Chinatown for 1-2 dollars each. After I was hooked into making great bread,  I went back and read about Ken's quest for materials and location.  I appreciated his effort and am acquainted with Portland and the area his wheat comes from.  To date, I have made aver 90 lbs. of excellent bread (from p 103, I think...I forgot my book in Idaho).  We sometimes save back half of the dough to make an excellent pizza crust.  Ken's book is written to help you discover the principles that can be used to make artisan breads as well as providing recipes to follow. I appreciated learning about gluten, its role in bread making and about different types of flour etc.  By understanding Ken's journey to become an artisan bread maker, readers can make personal connections to his passion which served as my own catalyst. I'm now experimenting with sprouting wheat from my own field and making sprouted wheat bread. It's very good, It's healthy  and I'm having fun.  Ken's book was the inspiration, providing the guidance and information I needed to make intelligent baking decisions, and waking the artisan in me.  Regardless of if one follows the recipes as written or uses them as \\"jump-off\\" points with guidance, this is a great book in my opinion.<br />SteveColeman

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard that Downton Abbey was really very good, but must disagree. It is superb!  I just finished the  second season, and  am frustrated that I cannot go on to the third until it is available.<br /><br /> The period costumes are beautiful and it feels as if you are right there, in Downton, either with the family who lives there or below stairs with the servants.<br /><br />The plots are complex and  entertaining, and all the characters are believable and very human; some are laudable, some most definitely are not.<br /><br />I recommend it wholeheartedly.<br />This is entertainment at its best.  I fully recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the best game ever who wouldn't want this game the person who invented this should be stinking rich I love this game

B00BESM14U|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Makes me want to read the book again to look at it from a different perspective.
B007MHVVCU|5.0|Addicted to this series!<br />Anthony Horowitz is my favorite author!<br />Can't wait to read the other books<br /><br />Sincerely Jon<br />Twitter name: _WeaverFever_
0425252868|5.0|I can say only positive statements about this book. I wish I had the words to express how much I have enjoyed reading this book. It brought tears to my eyes. I even have to say it changed my life and my outlook and it is something I hope I never forget.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|One star is one to many!!! Takes 15 to 20 min. to load resources,  then when it checks resources it freezes and has to download resources again!  After over a half hour of this I still wasn't able to download this game!  Its a BUSTER alright...a rip off.
B005FISBTO|1.0|Luckily I read the review where they complained that the un-skippable \\"previews\\" give away the ending to season 6, so I just looked away til it was done. What cretin thought there was anything to be gained by ramming an endless Showtime promo<br />down the throats of people who have already PAID good $ to see the show they've chosen.  GRRRRRRRRRR.....  So far, I like Season 6 alot better than 5, though the Olmos character is just a bit tooo creepy, and Laguerta has to go. She is annoying<br />without being interesting.  Anyway...
B007IQX1G4|3.0|I don't know that I would watch this movie again. I thought it was sad and depressing. The desperate reach of Charlize Theron's charachter wasn't out of reach, if you know anyone who is an alcoholic!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I will be able to watch the movie by the midle of April. I leave abroad and the bluray will be brought to me by then.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Well, in all the movie was excellent! First, when I saw it in the theatre, I was like, eh, but by the end it was like a story of redemption. I did like it a lot. The blu ray was great too. Each time I see it, I find it greater.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I will be able to watch the movie by the midle of April. I leave abroad and the bluray will be brought to me by then.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really enjoyed the mixture of HO and brain work required to solve the mystery.  Highly recommend this game.  Worked great on both my kindle fire and my galaxy s3.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I will be able to watch the movie by the midle of April. I leave abroad and the bluray will be brought to me by then.
B00A3AUGEW|2.0|Over produced, over done, same old same old.  I think the guy has talent.  He should break away and try and do his own thing.  Does he have his own thing?  Time to find out.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is truly a great read. I really want to see the movie and debate to myself which is better.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The movie was ok, but the streaming experience was awful.  I have asked Amazon a couple of times for my money back or at least a free rental to make up for it and they have not replied.  I will never rent fram Amazon again!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I've never been a fan of the &#34;Masterpiece Theater&#34; series on PBS, but this season offers exceptional storylines surrounding an aristocratic family in England during 1920.  The acting is superb and the characters seem so real, which is why it's one of the top-rated and highly anticipated dramas to date.  Maggie Smith and Elizabeth McGovern are delightful in their performances and give the American viewer two fine actresses he or she can relate to, while introducing a whole new group of fine English actors whose characters everyone will embrace.<br /><br />Season three begins with Mathew and Mary getting married and the Crawley family have to face the fact that they may lose Downton Abbey to loss of money.  I strongly urge viewers to purchase all three seasons.  Season one introduces the family and servants in the year 1912 during the sinking of the Titanic, and season two involves everyone tackling the hardships of World War 1.  Some of the topics included in the Downton Abbey series are prostitution, May-December romances, prison, WW1, the sinking of the Titanic, miscarriage, and of course, many scandals.<br /><br />Don't miss out on this wonderful series!  Order your Season 3 DVD (and Seasons 1 and 2) now!
0345803485|3.0|I've heard so much about this I've decided to read it to form my opinion. Ana didn't sound like a graduating college student. more like high school.  and overuse of \\"oh my..\\" \\"fifty shades of..\\"...and seriously she has an issue with biting her lip constantly ??it must make her look like an idiot in public,...and I can't understand the Inner goddess bulls***
B0084670FU|5.0|I enjoy the three stories in one flim.  All three were damn good.  I will keep this one for later.
B009PJ1Q82|5.0|Keep the Lights On was a beautiful movie.  Thure Lindhardt will melt your heart as the sweet and lonely Erik. He was brilliant in this role!  I laughed and I cried.  It was well worth the roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Packaging was in tact, it arrived quickly and I am so glad that I made this purchase.
B006ZUCR5K|5.0|I LIKE THE SONGS I LIKE THE BACK UP MUSIC THE  SINGERS  THE WEBB SISTERS AND SHARON ROBINSON<br />MAKE THE MUSIC GREAT . LEONARD IS THE BEST
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|great action movie. the scenery andl location used throughoutt the movie were great. brought me back to when I was in Europe. good story line as well.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Gets better every time I listen. I love the instant download!  then comes the Cd a few days later. Win Win situation.
B008N9AASC|5.0|I did not know what to expect as far as movie content, but I was impressed. If you buy this you should also buy Baraka. A very similar concept and just as good, maybe better,
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|one of th best games I've played.  maybe a few too many locations; I forgot one day to the next where I saw things. Overall, lots of fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app because it is sooo fun and its really challenging and its also giving ur fingers a workout so that great as well I gave 5 stars because of the game quality and its really good fir little kids so that's what I think what do you think????[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I love this book so much It gives you so much nolege that you will be ready for college I even did it
B005HSL626|5.0|alright, I love this game and I would rate it 4 stars, but because my dad cant leave reveiws of my nolege, I'm counting in his 5 stars ( even if you do the math and averaging it should be 4 and a half stars)  but anyway I say you should get it Cuz its free and you don't have to pay a dollar a try at a huge screen of this at a Dave and busters with all the sticky finger prints on it, very addicting game, have fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this app but I don't understand why there's a bunch rainbow unicorns that you can buy. And I don't like how the unicorns cost so much. But other then the unicorns I love this app!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It is different from the usual romance novel where you know what it going to happen next. Kept me interested till the end.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is really a fun and cute game.Lots of bright colors and good graphics.My daughter loves to watch her baby dragons grow up.she can always use new friends.  Add us:beccalation81
B000957O82|5.0|Hitch is one of my all-time favorite movies. It’s a romantic comedy filled with a cast of great actors and actresses who make this movie memorable which is why I gave it 5 stars. The relationship dynamics between men and women are relatable and funny. If you enjoy romance, comedy and the beauty of friendship, this movie is for you.
B005K17RU0|5.0|information that is easy to absorb.  The site is very intuitve and easy to navigate.  Better than the Weather Channel's app.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This is a new and improved Jason Mraz, and I really liked him before.<br />Now, I'm &#34;Living in the Moment&#34;.
B004N44SOI|5.0|This was a gift more my son that I took the liberty of coping to my computer for myself. This will not disappoint.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Great documentary film! &#34;Sugar man&#34; is an example of pure, untainted talent as a reflection of life lived with profound, majestic simplicity.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Wow. What an amazing movie. You have over 1400 reviews here, so there's not a lot I can add to inform your perspective on what happens.<br /><br />Even so, it reminds me of 'Breakfast Club' for an older generation, where you have a group of people brought to a circumstance by coincidence, yet in the process, they have a common experience.<br /><br />Here, we have culture, family, grief, sadness, surprises, young-learns-from-old, love at its purest, learning from experience, joy, resolution, eternal hope, and oh so much more.<br /><br />You'll be drawn to this movie if you have ever lived, traveled, learned from experience, experienced loss, or loved another.<br /><br />I had this movie in my Amazon Wish List for so long, but finally watched it. It definitely warrants the 4+ stars of 1400+ reviewers.<br /><br />Great lines from the movie:<br /><br />* It's never over.<br />* Nothing happens unless we dream.<br />* Can we be blamed for feeling we are too old for change.<br />* It's also true that the person who risks nothing, has nothing, and does nothing.<br />* As someone once said, everything will be alright in the end. And if it's not alright, trust me, it's not the end.<br /><br />5 Stars!!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|It's a creepy game and it actually builds suspense well as you're playing.  Glad I got it free!<br />Slender man is going to get you!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Scenery ravishing, animation delightful, and story satisfying. Good viewing for youngish children and environmentalists and people who like women characters who prevail over repressive, repressed, and class-bound Victorians.
098555780X|4.0|Plenty of different knots to get you started and other information. Can't wait for the next book. &#34;But&#34; some of the pics aren't very clear of what to do next. But with the help of youtube on the side everything was easy after that. Would have liked to see some of the bracelets with buckles used also. I really enjoyed this book and the information also. this is a must have for beginners. I don't know but maybe more advanced people might find this book good too.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|The film is a good corrective to the idea of a fat dumpy queen who &#34;is not amused.&#34; The costumes are perfect and the plot can only be objectionable to those who require absolute accuracy.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book has a little bit of everything. The writing is captivating and the unconventional form of storytelling was thrilling. I couldn't put this book down!! It's one of those where I'll genuinely miss the characters now that I'm finished reading it.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The movie starts off slow and takes a while to build up to the plot being in motion.<br />There is plenty of relatively non-gory violence while we wait to see things kick into action.<br /><br />Once we get the gist of the plot, then it becomes a waiting game as the main characters circle.<br /><br />It's clear long before you get to the end of the movie who is in the final confrontation.<br />This lead me to suspect how things might have to end.<br /><br />It was worth the $5 since I didn't have to buy popcorn, soda, nor deal with talkers doing the movie.
0345803485|5.0|I had seen a lot of press about the book and the author. I was interested in reading it for myself.
B008XBCJ34|1.0|Just a rip off of about 5 other movies. Horrendous, overrated, over hyped...this was up for an Oscar? Also...what's up with the tail on tail action? EW.
1572816112|5.0|I have a few things I want to go over because I was a first time buyer, and I needed the information covered:<br /><br />►This is a typical full deck with 78 cards. Both major arcana, and all suits are included.<br />►There is a paper mat included for the Lunatic spread.<br />►There is a booklet that comes with it.<br />►The cards are very easy to identify. (Though you'll need to know roman numerals.)<br /><br />In regards to the booklet, I opened the box, and found that it was not what I'd expected. It is a hair smaller than the length, and width of the cards, and had been placed inside the same box as they were. Make no mistake, this is not a book. Do not be shocked when you receive a box of cards, and there appears to be no larger text book with it.<br />That being said, I have yet to want more from the booklet!<br />►It gives you both upright meanings.<br />►It gives you reversed meanings.<br />►It describes the image. (This has helped me interpenetrate readings.)<br />►The booklet did NOT cover any layout other than the lunatic spread.<br />That being said, there are plenty of websites that cover the subject. I don't feel that much was a real loss.<br /><br />I have to say, I don't think I could be happier with my pick. The only downfall I see is the lack of layouts within the booklet.<br />I love the lunatic spread. I love the way the artwork feeds into the readings rather than hindering them. The backs of the cards are so visually pleasing that I've even opted to keep them neatly stacked on my desk.<br /><br />I've been wanting a deck for more than ten years now, and these cards have not disappointed.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|Worked great and I would be happy to buy from them again
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's better than temple run! There are no glitches or bugs. I totally recommend getting it!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|After having many people suggest that I read this book I did. And I wish I had done it sooner!  This is a great story from a dog's point of view of his life and the life of his friend. Some people think that a dogs life is pretty easy, but this story makes you think that dogs are here for us more then we know.  Yes, there is a lot of references to racing (if you didn't get that from the title), but it helps with the story.  I would highly  recommend this book!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I reallye enjoyed played Mahjong on this system.  i wished it could be more. Mahjong it make you used your mine.

B004UID2LC|1.0|The first video I tried to play once I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire from YouTube started to play the song but the screen was black.  There were no controls visible and no clicking or sliding available.  No matter what I did, the song kept playing... and we are talking about a concert here!  After some research I found the kill app button... and the song continued to play.  I then uninstalled the Downloader ... and the song continued to play.  Eventually I turned my Fire off and restarted... phew, no more song.<br />I advise customers to read the 1 star reviews - they are accurate.  Amazon should not be supporting this app.

B008KOTNVA|5.0|I bought this kit to repair my Macbook.  It was a complete nightmare.  The bit I actually needed for the Trackpad according to the iFixit website ( Y0 ) , had a blunt tip and wouldn't fit in the screw.  About half the bits were machined pretty poorly - blunt tips, bevels or domes that were tall enough to prevent a grip on most electronics screws... I was mad and felt cheated.  This kit was not worth $30.  It was not even worth $5.<br /><br />I got in touch with iFixit... and they were **amazing**.<br /><br />Their team was incredibly apologetic and wanted to make things right.  ( for me, that was a huge win already ).  All the other reviews were 5/5 stars.  This was highly recommended by friends.  Something must have slipped past QA for me to have *this* in my hands.<br /><br />iFixit sent me a package that contained a kit from their newest shipment / version -- a kit which had a build quality that was drastically better.  While this isn't a super-expensive precision toolkit... it's still only a 9/10 on build... but at this price point it's just amazing.  A better kit costs at least three times as much.  The differences between these two were night & day -- everything was just significantly more precise and better machined.<br /><br />That's not all though.<br /><br />After doing some digging... they realized that the Y0 screwdriver that they recommended for this particular repair, was actually a smaller screw.  They updated their site with all the new info and also sent me a standalone screwdriver to handle this repair.<br /><br />While I felt cheated with my original shipment, I would definitely recommend the replacement they sent to everyone.  I also wouldn't have any reservation buying from iFixit again -- everyone makes mistakes and QA issues happen.  The difference is in how people handle Customer Service.  Like so many other vendors, they could have made me jump through hoops for a repsonse, they could have forced me into a maze of Form Letters, they could have insisted on a crazed RMA process.  They didn't do any of that  - the team at iFixit was amazingly supportive, courteous and proactive.  Five stars for the product and a hundred more for their service.ve insisted on a crazed RMA process.

B0067AC5KA|4.0|He goes into too much detail about things that are not relevant the story. Still enjoyable read. I did not care for the ending.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|Had to load it twice on my kindle fire to get it to work. Appears to be another &quot;Temple Runner&quot; only in black and white. It also has a joystick Icon instead of the swipe controller. I am not a fan of this type of game even after giving it several tries. Uninstalled.
030758836X|1.0|I can hardly believe this is a popular book. To me the whole thing was sick, really sick. Amy is a sociopath and instead of being caught in the end her husband gives in to her. It left me with an awful feeling. Don't waste your money on this one.

B0067R0APK|2.0|The app is OK,  a bit cumbersome to use to get to the days forecast by hour,  but the forecast for today for example is completely off.  Sunny and 60 degrees is what TV stations had forecast but not Fox News and this app.  They said 49 degrees and cloudy.  So what good is this app?  Also,  advisories cannot be canceled so I have to keep being distracted by a red exclamation point all day.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Even though I have a weakness for complex fantasy fiction ( how else to explain my 20 year fascination with the\\"Wheel of Time\\" series?), I didn't expect to really like this series, but almost against my will, I've begun to care about these characters and the whole complicated storyline. I don't read fiction analytically. I just know when a book/series grabs my interest and makes me unable to stop reading. This does.
B00BHMF578|4.0|It is suspenseful and well worth watching.  It was interesting to see the dramatized version after watching the true account told by Tony Mendez in the TV documentary.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|This is an MP3 that showcases the diverse talent of Bruno Mars. He is so talented that the curse words are more of a distraction in songs than a punctuation. Very good.
B000W089XS|4.0|I adore this movie. With the marvelous cast: Marilyn Monroe, Lauren Bacall, and Betty Grable - and the screwball premise of three models pooling their resources to rent a penthouse apartment just long enough to meet millionaire husbands... and yet it never works out as planned. Marilyn is especially charming as the model who believes that \\"men won't make passes at women who wear glasses\\" and is subsequently bumping into furniture and talking to plants -- priceless. One of my favorite Marilyn performances!

B005XR3K5M|5.0|Back in April of last year, a set of Zelda playing cards went on sale, which were a great new medium to express fans’ love for the series. Newly available as an import from Japan as an officially licensed Nintendo product, this deck of Zelda playing cards celebrates the 25th anniversary of the series and can be purchased from Amazon. Featuring artwork from every installment in the series, these cards cost roughly between $20 USD and $30 USD depending on the seller. To pass the time patiently awaiting the release of the next Zelda title, pick up a deck today and play a few rounds of poker!

The biting sarcasm is still pertinent and fresh.
B00APDABX8|4.0|A pitch perfect examination of familial relationships are at the fore of this compelling new thriller by Doug Johnstone. As the synopsis states, the reader is drawn into the tale through a series of reveals, that allow us to bear witness to the deep, dark secrets that exist within families, and yet, by the same token, illustrates the ability to bring forth forgiveness for the sins of the past.<br /><br />Mark Douglas' life is turned upside down by the suspicious disappearance of his wife Lauren, leaving himself and his six year old son, Nathan, in a state of turmoil. Lauren has disappeared before suffering the effects of post-natal depression in the wake of Nathan's birth, and with Mark's knowledge that his wife is pregnant again he fears that these events may well be repeating themselves. However, as the plot unfolds and Mark receives some devastating news, it becomes clear that with the police dragging their heels, there are darker motives at work in relation to her disappearance than at first thought, leading Mark and his son into extreme danger.<br /><br />As events unfold we discover Mark's previous propensity for violence, admittedly in defence of his wife Lauren initially, but enough to cause the police some suspicion as to how much of a part it plays in his wife's disappearance. As Mark struggles to keep mind and body together for the sake of his son, Johnstone builds the air of tension and frustration, that Mark experiences and more crucially how this dark corner of Mark's personality rises again as he labours to discover the truth. We see a man quick to anger under pressure, but is he as guilty as the police suspect? I'm not telling...<br /><br />His relationship with his son is perfectly portrayed, showing the mantle of parenthood is no easy one with Mark experiencing all the normal peaks and troughs of becoming a sole parent to a lively six year old boy, confused by sudden the absence of his mother. As events spiral out of control and Mark embarks on his own personal crusade to uncover the truth, his anger levels ratchet up, until he questions his own sense of control even in relation to his son, and this provides another interesting facet to the overall story. There is also a poignant theme of familial reconciliation built into the plot, as bridges are rebuilt between Mark and Lauren's mother, following a violent altercation some years previously, centring on Lauren's relationship with her father. This works well within the plot, and adds a solidity to the portrayal of human relationships, which I think is the stand out feature of the novel.<br /><br />As the reasons for Lauren's disappearance come to light and the story denigrated into some fairly unbelievable confrontations, I must admit by not being truly convinced by the whole set-up and the central premise. However, as I have already identified the strength of the characterisation and the development of relationships as the main hook for this novel, any weaknesses in the playing out of the plot are easily ignored, as Johnstone so readily engages us with his heartfelt portrayal of Mark and Nathan and the minutiae of their relationship, reeling from the loss of their wife and mother respectively.own personal crusade to uncover the truth, his anger levels ratchet up, until he questions his own sense of control even in relation to his son, and this provides another interesting facet to the overall story.

B004EC5IUW|5.0|This is a true must have for every Eva fan, despite the history of the original series has changed, the beautiful images and CGI animation is very well done, and the sound has improved (obviously). Inside the blue box its the Blu-ray disc and a booklet with the new features of the movie and high quality images.

B005LAJ23A|5.0|Incredible series. Each episode draws you in further and further, to a shocking final 2 episodes. Can't wait for season 3 on DVD/BluRay
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Great Movie..I truly enjoyed this movie from start to finish.  The birthday party scene was one of my favorites.  Had me smiling!
B005HED11Y|4.0|The remastering on this great..........way better than when originally on TV.  Enjoyed the episodes  I watched alot better than I thought I would.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I liked this Movie, Great Special Effects, Story Line was Plausible, Fast Paced...<br />I would have liked to see more of a Tie-In to the Last &#34;Episode&#34;, and why the other Member of the Cast wasn't In the Movie until the end, since in prior Sequels he was a Key Player..<br />The only reason I didn't give this Movie 5-Stars is I felt that Cruise had a bit to much of the &#34;Spotlight&#34;, and the supporting Cast could have been a bit More Involved.
B00942X8PY|5.0|I was actually pretty surprised by this game. It has a good amount of levels and several different kinds of block pieces to keep you challenged. Pretty easy to pick up and hard to put down. Nice graphics and decent sound, too. Worth a download if you like mind puzzling games!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 4 should have started - YESTERDAY!  Seriously, there should be laws about requiring viewers to have to wait long periods of time before the next episode.  The acting is very good, character selection is excellent, and the constant twists make it addicting.  Hurry up and get on with it again!

B008V0OLOW|5.0|Have had this CD for about a year. It's definitely different from other Krall albums, but I've come to like what she's done here.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I'm not a 'gamer', but I really, REALLY like THIS ONE!!<br />The graphics are nice and smooth.  The modes and options allow me to play it pretty much the way I want.<br />The first weekend I had this installed was bad weather - I played this so much that I had to recharge my phone, TWICE (I usually recharge every 3-4 days).<br />I like that I can play a cpl minutes or for as long as I want.  I like that I can pause a game and resume it later.<br />If I may offer some suggestions:<br />It'd be nice if we could select which mini-cubes to use - there are 2 that I have trouble telling apart.<br />You could add another element to the game by giving bonus points for clearing specific cubes last.
1476729719|5.0|In a nation where bullying and safety in our schools is becoming a hot button issue, Jodie Picoult realistically and tastefully tackles each of the issues.  As a victim of bullying as a child, a current educator, and an aspiring parent, I was captivated from page one until the end.  Without meaning to, it is easy to become personally involved in each of the characters.  The reader cannot help but become engrossed in the events which lead up to the fatal morning, and after one year had passed.<br /><br />Each of Picoult's well-developed characters make it easy to feel connections to the emotions of love, hate, and understanding.  It is easy to \\"fit into the shoes\\" of each of the characters, as flashbacks to the readers' own school experiences come to the surface.  One moment, the reader feels infuriated by the heartless acts of each of the characters.  In another, one might feel remorse and understanding, intermixed with moments of confusion, as the puzzle pieces of the story begin to fit together.<br /><br />This thought-provoking novel is an easy read, even for those who are reluctant readers.  It challenges the reader to reflect on their own feelings towards pressing issues, as well as their feelings towards others who are alike and different from their own personalities. I would encourage all adolescent and adult readers to take a moment out of their chaotic lives:  take a deeper look into the mixed-up worlds of the American child, teenager, and adult, struggling to survive each day with a plethora of complicated life decisions, addressed within this novel.

B00AHSINKO|3.0|another love story with our favorite actors.  this one was, though, not quite up to par.  Maybe it rates 4 stars, donno.
B00AFEY354|5.0|As someone who is always a bigger fan of the books than the movies, I was very nervous for this film to come out.  It's one of my favorite books for a multitude of reasons, and though I felt reassured because the author was heavily involved, there are certain creative liberties that must be taken and I was nervous.  No reason to be nervous though--I was, and am, completely blown away.  The cast was unbelievable, the scenes beautifully shot and perfectly edited [particularly for the last few scenes...masterful], the score and soundtrack excellent.  Ezra and Emma are getting a lot of well-deserved recognition, but I would have to say that Logan Lerman as Charlie was my favorite.  He so perfectly captured Charlie's essence that it still takes my breath away.  I cry every single time I watch this film.  It is truly timeless and instantly one of my favorite movies.  It's not often that an honest story gets a chance to shine.
B00BHMEOP2|5.0|This is a very suspensful, well-played movie.  One would have thought it entirely fiction (though I am sure some of it was fictionalized).  Very good movie.  Bravo, Ben!
1423113381|5.0|Kept me reading and on the edge.  Very intersting and fun to read.  Any one that likes adventure would enjoy and would love to read this book
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|ugh  How stupid do you need to be?  I wouldn't even waste the time to watch this for free on TV.
B000W0B0G6|5.0|I stumbled across a Cat Stevens Greatest Hits CD and couldn't believe how good every song was. They were more nuanced and dense in the arrangements than I remembered. Maybe my sound equipment is better than it was during the '70's! The drumming is excellent. Lots of tricky timings and it all wholes together beautifully.<br />I've revisited many older music loves and found them to be a disappointment over the years but not Cat Stevens.

B007C1PXAM|4.0|This book is a great bio for Anthony Bourdain and I recommend it highly. He was brutally honest about his past and if his career as a chef didn't work out, he could have been a comedian
B000FC1HBY|5.0|What is happening in George Martin's head? The intricate details behind his fantastical tale of Thrones are amazing. Fantasy is not a genre I usually read (non-fiction history), but certain writing transcends preferences. Mr. Martin's imagination is brilliant, as is his writing. You feel as if you are there.<br /><br />The series of books are page turners, you will lose sleep because you will not want to put them down. I got a late start on the books, as well as the television series based on the books. My son insisted I read/view these. I was skeptical, now I am enthralled. I am reading to stay ahead of what I am viewing.<br /><br />I'm just glad I don't have to give a book report because this would take all day to explain.<br />READ IT - You WILL love it!<br /><br />If there was a 10 star rating available... 10 STARS!
B0010X8NF0|1.0|I dont get it...... what was the point of this thing again?  Did anyone even see this turd, or was it just me?
B007IK44CK|5.0|Never a dull moment. Great plot and very good acting by all involved. Tom is in great form pulling off impossible feats will keeping a calm demeanor. Good follow to his previous film.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|According to what I have read about this book it was supposed to be Vonnegut's signature piece of work.  I enjoyed it, I didnt love it though.  I would even go as far to say that this was my least liked Vonnegut book so far.  I guess the story just didnt speak to me or something.  The protagonist is never really fully developed and therefore I never really feel as though I am rooting for him.  He serves as a narrator more than anything else in this tale about a late absent minded professor and his simpleton children.

Reading from a horses perspective was really very enchanting.<br />As humans we ask a lot of our horses...but to be a part of our wars well that is a task the horse has no choice about.<br /><br />I am glad I read this book, there are parts of it that still haunt me.  Thinking of horses in no mans land.....muddy, cold and hungry.<br /><br />A sad war where so many lives were lost both equine, human and canine and all for what?<br /><br />Worth the read definitely.

B00AEBBA9U|5.0|It would be pretty good if Amazon would especify, in their presentations of the films, if they are subtitled or not. English subtitles are enough for me,  I know the lenguage well enough to understand almost everything, but titles would be nicer for us foreign buyers- the excelent Olive Films collection does not have any kind of subtitles. It will not keep me from buying \\"The quiet man\\", for instance, but it would be more of a commodity.<br />Jaime Chávarri Madrid.

B0090CVJZ4|4.0|These plugs are very well made and I had no problems threading the wire down the center and getting it held in place with the center screw. I guess it all depends on the price you get them at, since there are a few other options sold on the site that come down to a few cents cheaper per pair. That being said, Amazon Basics is a line o products that one can trust to always deliver a decent quality product for a fair price, and these banana plugs it perfectly into that model.
B00873GRU4|4.0|Well, good. I can say this was the first futuristic novel that I have ever read. The choice steamed from the fact it was one of the 'First Tuesday Book Clubs' choices for the month of February 2013.

B0012DW6W4|5.0|This movie is seductively sinful and romantically stirring!! There's passion, lust, desire, deceit and the reality of true love. Perfect cuddle movie to watch by the fire.
0307341550|4.0|It's hard not to make comparisons to Flynn's 2012 novel, Gone Girl, when reading Sharp Objects, which was her debut novel. I had to remind myself that since Gone Girl was my favorite book of 2012, it was highly unlikely that Sharp Objects would be as good. And that's true it wasn't - but it was still very, very good. Gillian Flynn has created complicated, creepy characters and a complex plot with a nice twist at the end. Flynn makes Camille's hometown's thick, gothic atmosphere jump off the page. And somehow she made me sympathize with Camille, even though she made so many bad choices. This book is an excellent thriller - a must read.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|This was a thrill to watch. The acting was supberb and the story was of cours, Fantastic! The overall spectacle was lush and beautiful. I will watch this again.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Im totally addicted to this game, I love it, me and my kids play it on my note 2 all the time

B006MW3UZW|5.0|we got hooked on this program.  After watching season 2 on Amazon Prime, we had to buy season 3.  We watched three episodes a night.<br /><br />Can't wait until January for season 4.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love USA network TV show -- Suits. It is my favorite TV show EVER!!<br />Harvey Specter by Gabriel Macht is sensational. He is so handsome and Hot! I also love characters, Mike (PJA is an excellent actor), Donna (Sarah g. Rafferty is so witty and loyal), Rachel (Meghan is a beautiful and strong woman), Louis (Rick is a great actor) and Jessica.(Strong woman and great actor) The entire cast is great!<br />The show creator and show runner Aaron Korsh is intelligent and  humorous.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|A typical Sparks' novel. He writes a good clean story, but it is very predictable. Not worth a second read.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great time killer. This app keeps me busy all the time. I have found no issues with this game what so ever.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|Loved this book so much chose it for our Reading Group!  Evoked many emotions!  Some very strong characters emerged.  You could feel yourself being transported to the Cornwall coast.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was an amazing book, I loved all of it. I got so hooked on it that  every page held a new secret.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|If you like reading books that cover a few time periods, and keep you guessing until the final chapters, then this is one to read.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic. Absolutely wonderful. I would definitely recommend this to everyone I know. Personally, I thought it was better than the movie. It was more intricate, and interesting. It had multiple parts that weren't in the movie and I enjoyed that. I will consider reading this one again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game for all ages.This game is addicting and it sucks me in.Much like temple run but more colorful and fast
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very intense story of a family struggling to understand their child and facing a knowledge no parent wants to ever believe.
B00797MB0O|1.0|It took a lot to get through this story of a lonely, gorgeous, alcoholic only for the story to just abruptly end. Nothing was resolved, she basically went home and embarrassed herself and left.  Do not waste your time.
1594487154|5.0|\\"These also who erred in spirit will come to understanding,\\" -- Isaiah 29:24 (NKJV)<br /><br />The big takeaway from this book for many people will be that their success depends, at least in part, on their ability to sell their ideas and beliefs so that others will act on them. Daniel H. Pink aptly points out that tens of millions of Americans have such challenges, most of whom are unprepared for how to meet them.<br /><br />Once a reader joins the boat of realizing the need to persuade others, naturally some advice is needed. Mr. Pink deftly combines the lessons from the better books in the field of persuasion to present some simple, but critical, principles to apply:<br /><br />Attunement: See the situation from the other person's perspective and add to it the emotional connection of empathy, while mirroring what other people do physically when with them.<br /><br />Buoyancy: Be ready to bounce-back from whatever setbacks and discouragements occur by managing your mental and psychological state.<br /><br />Clarity: Find the right problem, frame it so others can relate to it, and give people directions for what to do.<br /><br />To apply these principles, be prepared to pitch your idea in six new ways. apply the principles of improvisation to work effectively with others to accomplish more, and engage in adding more service to improve matters for others.<br /><br />The book is filled with compelling stories, nice examples, and crisp writing.<br /><br />Here's my pitch for the book: Need You need it!
B00338QENI|5.0|One of these most tragic and the same time uplifting stories I've read.  Horrific what we have done in the name of science but also what we have accomplished.
B003XMXZCW|4.0|alright, I'll assume you already know about this movie, or you'll find out about it on your own. That should save a lot of time.<br /><br />What I was not expecting was the great resolution. I mean, they somehow put 2 movies on one DVD. I didn't think that could be done, with movies this long, and still deliver good resolution. Instead, when I played it on blue-ray player, I could not find fault with the detail of the resolution.<br /><br />The sound was not quite what I expected. Sure, it was all there, and audible. But I thought I'd get a bit more umph from the helicopter fly-bys, and explosions and such. For comparison, check the low-level punch from choppers and explosions in some of Arnold Shwartzeneger's movies (yea, I know I misspelled it). The sound tracks from The Doors were better, but still not what I expected. Instead, I felt the sound came in at about a 7 our of 10 in terms of quality.<br />But, for a movie like this, who would complain, right?<br /><br />*************<br />STOP READING HERE IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY SEEN THIS MOVIE !<br />*************<br /><br />One thing that I can't place, is the ending. I would swear that when I saw this movie decades ago, that the ending scene showed the whole area getting bombed. Well, in keeping with the \\"drop the bomb, exterminate them all\\", ergo, the Apocalypse as far as the tribe goes. In fact, I'm pretty dang sure that's what I saw. Well, on this DVD, that does not happen. I saw the 'original' on this DVD first, and missed the apocalypse at the end. So then I played the redux. But that one had no apocalypse at the end either! I wonder if the director wimped out?<br /><br />Other than all that, this is a great movie, and having it at what I consider great resolution makes it worthwhile.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I have never watched any of the Star Treks but thought I would give this one a try. I loved every aspect of the movie. However, the seller's product came in damaged and the case was split in half. The damaged case really iritated me but the movie is outstanding.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it was a great. This story made me feel sad,happy,and angry.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. I'm pretty sure that anyone who reads this book will love it as much as i did.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|I knew what was going to happen the majority of the time. these movies are coming to predictable, need to make it to where you have no idea what is going to come next.
B007REV4YI|5.0|We missed seeing this film in the theaters and as I have always been a Bond fan was anxious to get it on DVD.  Was not disappointed.  Great action, performances and scenery.  Loved the movie.  Highly recommend it!
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|Great movie about the Tuohy's inviting a kid that has no where to go and sending him to school. Great that they bring him in and make him apart of the family, giving him a room, a truck and many more things that not only changed his life but also the Touhys. Would and will watch this movie over and over again.
B001NKI60W|3.0|ABBA rocks.  So the music in the movie is 5 stars.  However, the movie is only good enough compared to the girl next to you.  What are you willing to do for her?  Funny, how the company of the right person, can make a movie watchable.
B000007MVX|5.0|It is a story of life and death, beginning with a recently deceased man viewing his own funeral, descending into purgatory and Hell, then reincarnated.<br /><br />How can you argue with lyrics like these:<br /><br />Show me a good man.<br />I'll show you the door.<br />The last hymn is sung and the devil cries ``More.''<br />Well, I'm all for leaving and that being done, I've put in a request<br />to take up my turn in that forsaken paradise that calls itself ``Hell'' --<br />Where no-one has nothing and nothing is<br />well meaning fool, pick up thy bed and rise up from your gloom smiling.<br /><br />I thank everybody for making me welcome.<br />I'd stay but my wings have just dropped off.<br />Hail!<br />Son of kings / make the ever-dying sign / cross your fingers in the<br />sky for those about to BE.
B006C45CFG|2.0|Sounds like a great movie, right?  And who doesn't like Harrison Ford, or Daniel Craig, these guys rock.  However, I thought the movie took their characters a little to far to be likeable.  It was a cold movie, because these guys were cold.  This movie should have been a blast to watch, sorry, it wasn't.  This movie could take a lesson from Outlander.  That movie rocked!
1401324649|5.0|This was an original, amusing and thoroughly diverting book have actually sent off for a hard copy as I read it first on my kindle while in New Zealand.
B005SAP45I|1.0|Mater is not a lead character.  He is sidekick.  The movie sucked for that main reason.  I wanted more 'Stickers', or similar.  Having Mater as the lead dumbed down the movie so bad, it made it completely unwatchable.  In fact, I feel I was ripped off, from the title of the movie.  I know for a fact, if his name would have been in the title somewhere, I would have avoided the movie.  Heck, the picture for the movie is misleading, as I look at it right now.  Who's ever idea it was to make the movie this way, should not be allowed back in the theater.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Well made production.  Captivates you to follow the lives of these villagers in 1895.  Experience their happiness and sorrow.  Quite a few excentric personalities to add interest in the ever changing plots of each episode.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|This movie turned out to be a lot better than I thought it would. It was dark, great effects, good story, and not cheesy. I was happily surprised by how good the movie was. Blows the old Stallone version out of the water.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This is an ok game for the kindle fire hd. I wish it zoomed in more to make it easier to see the hidden objects. Have not bought the full version. Not sure if I want to.
1427210241|5.0|This was the best of all the books.  It tied up all the loose threads and I loved the ending.  Brandon Sanderson writes Robert Jordan better than Robert Jordan did.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is one of the very best folk albums I have ever heard. Great harmonies, profound but simple productions with the lyrical finesse of a refined &#34;old school&#34; master.  Know that I'm jumping on a bandwagon... Just hope they can come up with another few gems.
B0085OELXK|5.0|I thought this was an unexpected role for Matt Damon and thought he did an exceptional job.  The rest of the cast all made the movie believable.  Thumbs up for this movie
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|This is a visceral retooling of the guitar-based rock of mid-career RT.  It is reminiscent of his very best melodic voice/writing, but with an edge.  I feel his best stuff in the last 10 years.
B0067R0APK|4.0|There is not enough radar and the interface seems kind of cluttered. Decent looking but needs more useful features. a+
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|No doubt that the torture scenes in the 45 minutes into the movie will stir up some feelings of consternation. Overall, this film was a condensed depiction of events that took place after 9/11 that led to its closure in the killing of OBL. The majority of the movie and events were true but some of the details were perhaps improvised to add drama and interest to the film. The acting and cinematography were superb. I still say Jessica Chastain should have won an Oscar. Her performance in Maya from going green during the interrogations to someone who was the complete OBL expert and hero was excellent.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it's hard for many people to separate the controversy in this movie. Though I believe the torture scenes used were useless to acquire information. So if the viewer knows this, the film will be more satisfying to watch. All this leading up to the ultimate climax make this movie one my favorites of all time. A very powerful movie that is a MUST WATCH.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Love the costumes! The story is really the relationships between the extreme uppers crust & the highest level that serve them.  Not happy about the ending. Could you really have a crash that horrific considering the extreme speeds the vehicles traveled at the time???<br /><br />Looking forward to season 4 as I just watched seasons 1-3 in the last 2 weeks :-)
B00985E3UG|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book for those that want to see the history of the corporate food industry. I went into this book expecting to see how horrid food giants like Kellogg, Nestl&eacute;, Coca-Cola and General Mills were. However I was pleasantly surprised to see the history of these companies and the history of the foods they created. It is definitely an eye opener and all the research and stories from actual industry leaders makes me give this book five stars for journalism an threat research. Be ready to have your eyes opened and make sure there is no food in your pantry as you read this, as I guarantee you will get hungry as you read each chapter.
1402712367|5.0|I requested this book for my daughter  for a school project and it was the best book, match all her needs.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Studio Ghibli has made several wonderful films. This is one of my favorite. The details in the drawing, the story line and subject are interesting and fascinating.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Twists & turns on every page keep you riveted to this unpredictable hero journey!  Come along for the fantasy ride of your life!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The creative tension between the main characters and the difference between &#34;normal&#34; and less than &#34;normal&#34; needs is kept unfailingly.  Sex scenes are real to young love.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I was not sure abt this game when I downloaded it but man am I happy I did.  Its a great waste of 10 or 15 mins then u wait until ur coins are regenerated and do it all again. I get to play abt 3 times a day. I would NEVER buy coins tho.
B00006RU5B|5.0|By far my favorite album by them, this CD stays in my car at all times. I never seem to get tired of it.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|It had been nearly 60 years since I read Tom Sawyer.  Some of the iconic scenes, such as the fence painting, were very familiar, but much of the book was unremembered by me, making this read as engaging as I'm sure the first was.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Once you become familiar with the designs and numbers the games are quicker.  I have been able to increase my score steadily.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|Love it.  It sometimes gets nerve/recking when I get in the wrong slot but that the fun of trying better the nxt time.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I like the multiple difficulty levels.  When you use the possibilitiy choices as numbers are completed the numbers automatically come off as real numbers are filled in.
0439023483|5.0|This is an amazing book that follows the story of Katniss Everdeen. It is a pretty quick read, but it has an amazing story to it. I'm definatly going to purchase the other two books as well.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|The app seems well designed.  The number and variety of puzzles make it quite enjoyable.  I can heartily recommend it.
B009INAKM8|5.0|If you love interpol, and there turn on the bright lights album. This is a must own! Lots of content and a remastered version of totbl, plus new songs.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A lot of sleep was missed because I didn't /couldn't stop reading this one.<br />Highly recommend to anyone that loves a great plot.
B001TODCII|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  I have watch this movie several times since purchasing.  It was a great deal for the price
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Done with this book for now, I will probably reread in a couple of years.  When is her new book?
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend and it was a hit.  I know that it has been watched several times already.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|came in perfect condition and earlier than expected. action packed and as alway jolie made it look easy and pleasant for the eyes at the same time. great addition to collection
B0009UC810|5.0|Have watched this movie before on the TV  with commercials. I perfer this version much better  I will have this movie for years to come.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|perfect condition, arrived earlier than expected, if you have seen the first you gotta own all three. great price and just awesome addition to collection
B00942X8PY|4.0|This is a path-creation puzzle game, similar to Trainyard, Flow Free, and Router Aqua (and I'm sure that there are many others that I have not acquired as FAOTDs). Instead of requiring the player to create a path between starting and end points, Huebrix defines the total length of the path to be completed.  This allows for features not seen in related games, such as plus- and minus-boxes that add or subtract from the length of path available. The graphics are simple and clean--this app should lend itself to a phone screen as well as it does to a 7\\" Kindle Fire.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, there are no instructions--but it's easy enough to figure out what's going on, and more-competitive players might benefit from realizing that despite the stinginess (and snarkiness) of the way the game awards medals, it's perfectly legit for figuring out the rules to be part of the game.<br /><br />Huebrix by itself probably deserves 5 stars.  I'm subtracting a star for the ads to the developer's other games and the IAPs that can result in accidental purchase of these games, and for the difficulty once the game has been started in accessing the home page with the sound controls. I didn't think the music and sound effects were unpleasant, but I perfer to play games with the noise off.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|It's a great story, it can be interpreted in many ways, that's what makes it interesting. The ending is the part that's more intriguing.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|This is a must have for any CD collection. I heard them on the radio and immediately bought the CD.
B009P5S11G|5.0|The cd is great, best songs I've ever heard and comes with 2nd disc. Album artwork is also cool and original
B005LAII80|5.0|You won't find much social commentary, romantic entanglement, or thought provoking moments in Dredd, but that's not why you want to see the movie.<br /><br />You want to see Dredd shoot criminals and blow stuff up. In 3D. And that's what he does. Dredd offers some stunning visuals when it comes to the 3D aspect of the film, but even without it, the movie is quite beautiful. So pick up this film if you just want an action-packed thrill ride full of eye catching scenes, and skip all the other silly aspects that go into making a movie.
B001XUPD94|2.0|I hadn't seen this movie in a number of years, so I thought I would re-watch it.  Unfortunately, as is widely known, only the even numbered Star Trek movies are any good.
6305212112|5.0|Can't say enough. Too many A list stars. I could watch this a million times. Gotta see it for yourself.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This was sorta scary but if this game scares you then try the pc version. But that's besides the point I love this game it's amazing!!!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Another great Richard Castle book!<br />After thinking that Rook was gone for good, he suddenly shows up when least expected!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my wife.<br />She loves this band. Actually it is quite a nice recording
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I have been  a Harry Bosch fan for quite awhile but I had never read the first  books in the series. So I started at the beginning of the series  and have been reading them in order.  &#34;Angels Flight&#34;  opens with  Harry Bosch in a raw emotional stay. The tension in the book between his personal life and the mission of his job..between his heart and his mind... between good and evil is a great read.  HIghly recommend it!
B00ATPVA78|3.0|This game is amusing and easy to use. It's good for many ages.  I'd recommend it as I do all G5 games. But as it's an expensive series you need to question if this is amusing enough.
B00942X8PY|4.0|This game is both fun and stylish, focusing on taking different colored blocks (ex. 9 blue and 5 red, fill up a 14 blocked puzzle), but with limitations on where you can put certain colors plus roadblocks. The game starts out very easy, and I was worried that it was going to stay easy and make it pointless, but it does a great job of getting progressively harder as time goes on. There is a timer on each level that counts how long it takes you to finish the level, which makes for great competition with your friends. The game does take advantage of Amazon GameCircle, you can compare achievements with your friends, but it would be good to have a leaderboard of the fastest times on each level and to be able to compare those with your friends.<br /><br />All in all, it's a fun game that has replay value (due to getting progressively harder), it's a game that will make you think, and it's a game that looks good visually and plays without incident. It's a fun game, and if you are a fan of the puzzle and mind games, it's worth 0.99 cents.<br />(Kindle Fire HD)
B009GX69RK|5.0|It's the only one we watch.  Love all the characters...hope it keeps going for a long time because we can't get enough of New Girl!
B0031R5K68|4.0|This book is a good read. Like his other books which follow a similar theme of religious intrigue and conspiracy this book examines the secrecy of the Masonic order, but in a positive manner. His characters are well described with the villain being obsessively engaged in a series of unconscionable murders and killings as he rampages through Washington in his quest for an icon which has been concealed and guarded by elders of the Masonic order, men who are pillars of society at the highest levels of society and power. True to form the plot twists and turns bringing up clues which need to be deciphered in order to progress to the next mysterious stage of the drama. Robert Langdon is the hero once again and he teams up with an intelligent woman in order to solve the mystery. It's a real page turner and one you will not want to put down from start to finish. Justice triumphs at the end but the reader is left with a slight unease knowing that underneath the civil veneer of western society may lurk a concealed world of religious intrigue that could overturn our democratic institutions at any time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book took my breath away. It was one of the best books I have ever read.  Absolutely, positively brilliant.
0062238868|5.0|A true insight into the life of a navy seal sniper including his wife's feeling about his time spent in service.
1401201911|5.0|I have always enjoyed credible alternative tales of mainstream characters, and this is one of the best.  It not only exemplifies the very traditions that first brought Superman to life, but implements some very fine, and creative science fiction that is not only believable, but quite enjoyable.<br />Well worth a read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is the best I have ever seen. Love the characters and the story line.Never liked zombie related shows until this.I'm hooked.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! 5/5 I recommend it to anyone who wants a book they won't be able to put down!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The only thing that I might like to see is more cubes with other symbols on them. I really enjoy (for some reason) tapping a box that is all the way through the cube.
059305184X|5.0|Lots of twists and turns in this suspsenseful novel.  Lee Child always has be sitting on the edge of my chair.  Its another one of those &#34;I can't put this book down&#34; novel.  I love the way Lee Child developes his characters.....its as though I become one ot them.  Great book indeed.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I've been going to PCB for the past 15 years and this explains every amazing moment I've had done there on the strip. Which is the road on the beach. Him being a northern Georgia boy explains why he used to go there for spring break.  This is probably the best album because it hits right home with my favorite place in the world! He plays the 18th at Spinnakers Beach Club. Man wish I would have known who you were at the time back a few years ago I probably seen you there. People who can't relate to this cd. It's about the amazing unforgettable times you have with your buddies in PCB. Will be blaring this down the strip! Thanks LUKE. Songs are similar to tailgates and tanlines.
B00B6DTIGW|3.0|A couple of good scares and I enjoyed the story. For me, the pacing was too slow; I would have preferred it to have been faster.
B00B4Z5GDQ|4.0|Dave, come on dude...I know how cool it is to show off a new piece of equipment for your home studio, but really?...A whole documentary? But glad to see someone bringing the importance of analog sound to newer generations and truthfully I found it to be a well put together and entertaining doc about a great musical legacy.
B007R0WHMK|5.0|This film is a funny, gorgeous piece of work.  My bf was skeptical, but he watched it with me and was very impressed.  Very well done!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I will just repeat my subject line: It is simply the marvelous capture of a period in history, spectacularly executed, both in the characters and realistic environs.
B005UBNKZG|4.0|first off i know nothing about computers. my comp broke and this is my first comp i built alone with almost no research on comparing products.<br />with this on sale for 130 i bought it. im a casual gamer who plays LoL, diablo III, Torchlight II, CounterStrike GO. With a $60 graphics card the games run almost flawlessly on high settings. i can dual monitor and stream 1080p movies with no effort and little difference while playing. if your on a budget for a reliable fast computer at around $420 id recommend this hands down.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Very Good Movie. I enjoy mine very much. Would recommend this for any one  to watch if like western movies
B004SBS8LA|5.0|First time playing, very fun and hard to put it down. Wish I had more power ups to use with out having to buy them.
1451695195|5.0|This is a well written book that offers insight into the life beyond. The case is even more compelling as Dr. Alexander offers scientific support to his claims. Being a health care professional myself I very much appreciated that aspect which is missing from most of these types of books/accounts. I could not put it down and finished it a day.
B007IK44CK|5.0|I loved this movie.  It had tremendous action scenes while keeping you on the edge of your seat.  I really wanted to see this movie and Amazon Prime made it possible.  Thank you.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It seems to be compatible, but I have yet to actually use it. Between the other apps I have already installed, I anticipate this one getting its' fair share of use.
B005AERS74|5.0|My son and I love Adam! We love to play Maroon 5 and dance around the house. This is a great album.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This result of all the misunderstandings in this movie make things that normally would not be funny, hilarious.  There are two distinctly different viewpoints going on the movie that cause the characters to act as they do and the concept is a brilliant idea.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love match-3 love the building aspect off this game also .  I've only played a few levels but am looking forward to much more

B0091LS07E|5.0|I have always been an avid fan of Alicia Keys and I have thoroughly enjoyed her journey as an artist. During the massive success that was her third album 'As I Am', Alicia was on a peak of creativity as an artist. And though I enjoyed her fourth album 'Element of Freedom', I can see how some people thought it was too pop and slightly off kilter. (Even though it contained her biggest radio hit to date 'Unthinkable'). However, with 'Girl on Fire' Alicia has returned to the poignant yet rhythmic songwriting that made her first three albums such huge successes.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br /><br />*Brand New Me<br />*When It's All Over<br />*Listen To Your Heart<br />*New Day<br />*Tears Always Win<br />*Not Even The King<br />*That's When I Knew<br />*One Thing<br />*101<br /><br />And that's the majority of the album which is why this album gets 5 stars. The other tracks are great as well but these are my favorites. Like I said, Alicia Keys is reborn with this album.

B00BESJYAY|3.0|Ok.<br />Based on a true story about Jay Moriarity (June 16, 1978–June 15, 2001), surfer.<br />The acting is not the greatest but it is  a plus anytime its based on a true story and the ocean takes up most the camera time.<br />Worth buying - no, worth streaming, yes! On a rainy day stream in sunny California.<br /><br />~~~ Jay  Moriarity is remembered as a soul surfer, winning many sportsmanship awards throughout his career~~~
B00BHU261S|5.0|Wonderfully evocative of LA and Hollywood as the late fifties turned into the early sixties. Story revolves around Hitchcock fighting Paramount and everyone else to make Psycho, which he thinks will be his breakthrough film. Helen Mirren is absolutely suburb as Alma (Mrs. Hitchcock) who at first resists and then supports the picture, and Scarlett Johansson is surprisingly good as a very sweet, naively trusting Janet Leigh. Anthony Hopkins blusters through with admirable fury and bravado, but he is not Hitchcock. Which is unfortunate, but seems a deliberate choice on someone's part. Just enough to suggest, but never enough to convince. Still, the strength of the story itself and quality of performance throughout this movie make it 100% worthwhile. Cinematography, costumes and production design are also first rate. Highest possible recommendation.

0060873175|4.0|Wow this book is catching a lot of hate.  I suppose some of it could be warranted because it is probable that Crichton didn't write most of this book.  In the end I don't find myself minding much as I still liked what I read.  Though I still had some complaints    I wasn't convinced by the science behind the shrinking. I suppose it would have been better if the hard science was not looked into.  Especially since it is all made up science to begin with.    The characters don't hold much dimension to them but as I read on I found myself not really caring.  They had very basic personality traits and my imagination had a fantastic time filling in the rest.  Unfortunately when the one character I actually cared about died midway through the book, my ability to empathize with everyone else quickly began to wain.  There could have been a lot more done with these characters.    One odd thing about them is how they'd nerd out about their situation at the most inappropriate moments.  Like being fascinated by the feeding habits of a spider mere minutes after someone had died.  It felt unnatural.    There is a police investigation subplot that doesn't have enough strength behind it for me to really care about.  I guess Preston felt like it was necessary to have some cops involved but I think the story would have worked without it.  If nothing else the subplot should have started earlier into plot than it did.    But anyway I guess in the end I can say Micro is totally better than Pirate Latitudes.  A book I bought because Crichton wrote it, bored me before I even reached the half way point, and plowed through it so I didn't waste my money.  I think Micro is full of suspense and fun.  Probably not scientifically accurate and it has awkward dialog.  In the end I found myself not caring.  This book is a fun read for long car rides or if you're in a plane but I can't really recommend it to anyone for at home reading.    Edit: If you can listen to the audiobook. Audiobooks improve all stories by 10%. At least the professional ones. So I listened to this novel again, and found it more enjoyable than I did my first time around.

B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|Had no idea of what was going to happen as I sat down to watch this film. Correction: I knew Bruce Willis was starring and that it had some relationship to science fiction. I have no idea how seriously the creators of the movie took any \\"message\\" it might have had, but, if taken as a story with just one major gimmick, it can be good light entertainment with a somewhat novel twist. As one reviewer accurately put it: nothing is given much depth. In keeping with his well-cultivated image of many movies, Willis is the glue holding it all together, as an FBI agent, first as a surrogate (with hair)and then as the human behind the surrogate (without hair but unshaven) The rest of the cast performs service-ably and there are an adequate number of car scenes to keep the action-hungry satisfied.<br />All-in-all, an action film for family viewing without too much pretense but a good show.

B003QP4BJM|5.0|This book was a gift to me from Davis Funds but i downloaded the Kindle edition upon starting to read it.  Once i started to read it, I could not stop.  It uncovers so much wrong headed thinking that is in vogue today.  In a time when there are many doomsayers this book makes a powerful case that things are much more likely to get better rather than worse.  The data is on the side of optimism.  Beware of leaders who interfere with human progress and think that they have a better way forward.  History is replete with leaders who have set us back by interfering with the natural mechanism of free exchange and specialization through the creation of rules and regulations which sap the system of its natural vitality and slow down the creative spirits of its people. The danger of our time now is that we have a government which believes that it can solve problems through the creation of many rules and regulations.  Failure is part of the creative process.  Using failure as an excuse to create volumes of rules and regulations will only slow down our progress.  You need to read this.
B003UAKE9Y|1.0|I love Neil Gaiman.  Everything he writes is mystifying, golden, and emotionally cutting...Saying that it is really bad to sit in a theatre and watch his material get brutally moleseted right before my then 13 yr. old eyes.  If you have read the book (which I doubt many reviewers on amazon have done) you would know how tremendously dumbed down and kiddied up this movie was.  They really wanted to draw in a child crowd so they took out a lot of the depth and endearingly dark qualities in the book and replaced them with empty hollow scenes (the garden scene that wasn't in the book), dorky unloveable characters (Wybie who's name is Whyborn probably because Neil Gaiman requested they name him that after he was stupidly designed and put in this travesty of a movie), and unaffectionate empty versions of the books original characters.  I cannot fully express how different these characters are from their novel's counterparts;  Coraline is sweet and adventurous and loves her parents very much and doesn't bitch at them at all like the film version of her does,  it was a HUGE mistake casting Dakota Fanning as her.  Her mom and dad were both loving and gentle parents, I DESPISED the film's version of the mom she was a nasty hag that being said the film version of Coraline was a whiny, selfish, brat which might explain why the film mom is the way she is....The book also has a far darker quality to it which, translated more expertly to film, would probably warrant a PG-13/R rating; It was dark, creepy, brutal, and adventurous.  The film was a bad joke.  That stupid scene where the Other Ms. Spink & Forcible strip down naked and try and do opera in competition with each other (which is ridiculous considering the two NEVER tried to outdo each other in the book) was, in the book, a scene where the two of them act as circus daredevils trying to aim with sharp knives at a small bullseye right above poor Coraline's head.  Sound better than two naked old women?  I thought so!  The scenewhere the Other Father chases after her on a giant praying mantis in the garden (that wasn't in the book) was a scene in the book where Coraline goes down to the basement to confront the Other Father for one of the lost children's souls...at this point the Other Father is a giant sewn up conglomerate of flesh that nearly KILLS Coraline, way better, way creepier.  There are NO stupid cutesy circus mice they were ALWAYS rats and Coraline ALWAYS KNEW they were rats in the book.  But probably the BIGGEST insult of all to the English writer Neil Gaiman is that the film takes place in America whereas he wrote a sentimental story about the English town he grew up in.  I would give this movie 0 stars if I could but I can't so I'll just say the claymation was good which it was and so was the character design.  That's about ALL that was good about the movie....
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I read all of the one-star ratings and enjoyed them far more than I did the film.  A dreadful, self-indulgent mess and an insult to the audience.  I've seen far more interesting stuff in my kids' kindergarten plays.  As many others have said, I'd like to have those 2 hours of my life back.
B00942X8PY|4.0|This is a nice relaxing game.  When I play games, I like to be able to play, stop, play, stop, and not worry about a timer ending the game.  Granted, I have only been playing it for a short while, but there were no other reviews, and I know that some people won't take a chance on a non reviewed game, so I thought I would comment.  Basically, you have a grid, and you need to fill it.  You are given a set amount of moves, as well as having to follow specific directions, and while it takes some thought, it has not been particularly taxing yet, but I have only finished the first level in both puzzle mode and zen mode, and I am certain it will get more difficult as it goes.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|The Sessions is based on the true story of a sex therapist/surrogate who assists a 40-something year old man paralyzed by polio to claim his own sexuality.  I know, I know, it  sounds creepy and pornographic,  But I was intrigued by the trailer, which actually seemed to be tasteful.  Well into the movie, I was surprised to notice that the sexual content and nudity [of which there is plenty] really became very secondary to the emotionally moving heart of the film. John Hawkes does an Oscar-worthy job as the paralyzed therapy-seeker who  has the courage to look for love. I don't know how many actors could engage the audience with the limitations imposed upon him, but he pulls it off using only his facial expression and dialog.  By the end of the movie, he has become someone all of us would like to know.  Helen Hunt is terrific [and gutsy, at her age] as the therapist.  Ordinarily she portrays characters with a bit of a tough exterior, but she also dug deep for this role, and is convincing as a compassionate therapist, willing to be vulnerable to help a fellow human being realize his greatest wish and full expression of his humanity.  William Macy is his usual quirky and spot-on self as a priest/friend who sees Hawkes through his journey.  In summary, this film earns its R rating and is not for anyone underage.  But for those who are not offended by a bit of nudity and frank language, the reward is a moving and tender love story--love in the sense of human connection and helping one another through the journey of life, what others might call &#34;agape&#34;.

B00005N6KG|3.0|I got these during the beginning of my search for headphones that would stay in place when I run. After reading so many positive reviews, I thought, $8.73, seems to work, give it a shot. From the start, the sound quality was pretty good, it fit pretty comfortably, and it was light, but the cord was shorter than I had expected. After two weeks of breaking in, I finally got them to stay put, but I found that they'd fall over my face with the slightest tug from the cord. I know that the packaging says that they do not hold up under abuse, but they just fell apart in two months, spending the majority of the time lightly wrapped around my phone:<br />In two weeks the speaker piece broke off from the piece connecting it to the headband at the wire on the left side; several days later the small bar attaching the headband to the speaker broke off (also on the left), and two weeks after that the same happened to the right; and a week later the sound went out in the left.<br /><br />Overall, it could have been better. But as there are so many positive reviews, and this may sound silly, but I am willing to give this product another try. Recently, I have tried the Sony MDR-J10, which didn't fit over my ears (good sound though!), and am returning those. Mine could have been a defective model, and even then they weren't too bad.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|Sound quality was great, and it was definitely easy to use.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to use.  Plug it in to the power, and usb to computer, install the included software, and it's ready to go.<br />You can split tracks into separate songs, and then label each one with all the information you want.<br />Sends the songs directly into iTunes.<br /><br />Cons:<br />No MP3 conversion on Macs (as far as I can tell right now).  Had to convert to MP3 using other software.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend for the price.  Great buy!

B00632HWOG|2.0|I’ve always relied on Yahoo as my primary personal email service and even upgraded their product as suggested to prevent additional spam and pop-ups, receive special updates, and to have access to personnel to assist with any problems I encountered with the site. Unfortunately, I had to cancel this, since the additional cost provided nothing of what they promised. I returned to the Classic Mail, and found that it was worse than ever before. I frequently encounter periods of time when I must log in every time I want to read or send mail, and my others have corroborated this time-wasting problem. Yahoo’s calendar doesn’t work on my Android phone either, so I have to use the Google (Gmail) calendar for that purpose. I’m slowly but surely transferring my account from Yahoo to Gmail, and though it’s difficult to change everything after so many years, it will be worth it in the long run. Of that, I’m certain. If you’re just setting up an email account or want to access news, sales, or other Yahoo services, I suggest that you opt for Gmail, since Hotmail tends to be a terrible spam catcher. Gmail is the trend, and I for one am following its services.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|This is a good movie with a good lesson - don't jump to conclusions about people because of their looks. It was a fun, funny, and a good new princess tale.
0783229372|4.0|The main character is portrayed by George C. Scott.  Scott was an actor with a calm exterior but an internal rage smoldering underneath all the time, a strange mixture of dry humour and serious power that made him a Hollywood favorite.  He's one of my personal favorites and I liked him immensely in this film.  While he had no German accent here (nor did any of the actors for the film, including all of those who played actual native Germans), he still did a good job at portraying a now-reluctant Nazi German flyer in the military.  Similarly, Anne Bancroft played a wealthy countess who stayed polite on the surface most of the time, but could get haughty and angry quite quickly.  She was a fine counterpart to Scott's character.  If it were me directing the film, I would've insisted that the native German characters would have an appropriate accent.  English was spoken the entire time during the film, even during scenes which only included native lifelong Germans, which also hurts it's credibility a bit in my book.  But I'm probably nitpicking.  It might've made more of an impact on the film audience, differentiating characters better and lending some authenticity to the whole event to use both the German accent and the German language when appropriate.  I'm not sure why Robert Wise (the director of the film) chose to have the actors use their natural voice in every case here.  Maybe in 1975, when this was made, the memory was still too fresh for too many people, and he thought that the actors keeping their own American accents would make them more sympathetic to an audience.  Despite doing my own research, I've been unable to find his reasons for this choice.  I think if the film were made today, German accents would be expected from actors playing those characters- and usage of the German language during a few scenes would be, too.  Maybe we just expect more from our actors regarding doing accents and using another language these days!<br /><br />The remainder of the film's roles were decently-cast with a treasure trove of character actors- Joanna Moore, Katherine Helmond, Richard Dysart, Peter Donat, Charles Durning and Burgess Meredith, amongst others.  The most impressive amongst these (for me, anyway) were Moore, Atherton and Donat.  Moore looked radiant in this film, despite the problems which plagued her personal life in reality.  Donat did an impressive, memorable musical number here.  Atherton was believable, sympathetic (in great contrast to his future roles) and intelligent in his role.  Some might argue that the film simply tried too hard to bring too many characters to life, which extended the time within the long movie and did make it somewhat challenging to lend three-dimensional qualities to everyone.  However, considering the real-life events surrounding the doomed airship, I can understand Wise directing the picture the way he did.<br /><br />This is probably not a film that you can watch once and grasp everything, either technically or amongst the characters.  I'm a history buff, a student of the German language and an avid movie-watcher.  Therefore, I have very high expectations of a film such as this.  While it's not perfect, some of the characters a little stiff or one-dimensional, in general it's a fine film which does a good deal of justice to the complexities which raged within Germany (and even the U.S.) about both the Hindenburg airship itself and the Nazi party.<br /><br />\\"The Hindenburg\\" is a film which tried to remain true to the interior and exterior of the actual doomed airship, and while not every little detail is perfect, it's still done very well.  Considering that there was no or little computer power available to fake effects back then, the mixture of real footage and movie footage is spliced together nicely.  The film short at the beginning of the movie that I can't tell if it was something which was really produced and shown in 1937, or something made up for the 1975 film.  If it's not a short that truly dates to 1975, you'd have to be a genius to tell the difference.<br /><br />All in all, I'd certainly play this film for a history, drama or German class in school.  The movie had enough real-life elements in it's favor, lending it considerable historical value in it's own right, to make it a must-see-once-in-your-lifetime picture.  If you liked the film, \\"Cabaret\\", you'd probably like this movie, too.ort that truly dates to 1975, you'd have to be a genius to tell the difference.<br /><br />All in all, I'd certainly play this film for a history, drama or German class in school.

B0095P3ULC|5.0|This is my personal favorite flick in the while transformers series. The audio alone in a good home system is entertainment in & of itself! The HD quality thru Amazon is imitative as well so in my book it's a total win win & win!
B002RRN952|4.0|A good addition to the series.  Definitely worth the time and money.  Clears up a lot of things that were just assumed previously.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|_I loved the storyline and the beautiful graphics. I do however feel that this game should not be 4.99.  The game was very short. I would have loved for the game to be a little longer.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Amazon provides Adobe Reader, but not the flash player. What's up with that? There s a lot of videos u can't watch because of this. Come on Amazon, get this right.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Another strong offering from Deftones.  I have been a fan since '95 and love everything they do.  No two albums sound identical (I am looking at you Godsmack), but you immediately know it is Deftones when you listen.  Nobody sounds like them.  You either love Chino's singing style or you don't.  If you don't, good... because I don't need to pay $100+ dollars to see them live anyway.<br /><br />Highlights are Swerve City, Rosemary, Tempest, and Goon Squad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love how this book is written and the characters were amazing! Can't wait to read the sequel! A must read

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Reading this is like having a conversation with Chris.  It's HIS story and you relate to this book on that level.  I enjoyed the 'real' of his writing and I came away with a deeper understanding and appreciation of our soldiers.  RIP Chris Kyle and thank you for your service!

B0084AZXKK|5.0|I read this story as a teenager.  Reading it as a retired person,<br />Was a real treat.  It is a classic.  Robert Louis Stevenson had<br />The gift of story telling.  This adventure on the high seas is<br />narrated from the perspective of the cabin boy.  I highly recommend<br />this book.
B009MXSWI8|4.0|I liked the first one better.  I was kind of wondering the whole time: &#34;why did the guy go back to the cabin in the first place?&#34; Maybe I missed the explanation in the beginning.

B00B935SUY|5.0|Dave Grohl did an amazing job...hard to believe all of that music came from that studio...watch this now! A must see...
B004478GN8|2.0|My son opened the set prior to realizing that it wasn't the set he ordered.  There were quite a few tears as we told him he had to package the set up and not play with it any longer until we could follow-up on replacing the set (he'd already been watching the mail daily for this set).  While Amazon was GREAT to deal with getting a replacement expedited, my son has been crying each day that he didn't have a set to play with after all of this waiting (not that it was sent late, but a week is a lifetime to a 6 year old).  While Amazon did a great job doing what they could to make it right, I would have much preferred to have avoided the hassle and the sad life lesson with my child.  At least it will all be better when we get the replacement in a couple of days.  It was a simple mistake by the vendor, but it had a significant impact.
B0091I7FEQ|4.0|pretty good book, I used it to learn regular expressions.  I would not recommend this book to someone just learning c++.

B001QL5MAA|2.0|Great imagination, Great concepts, Great technology...<br />...but not so great writing.<br /><br />Too long, too erratic, too little character development, too many flashbacks, too much information that everyone knows except the reader, too long before revelations, shallow characters.<br /><br />The biggest offense?<br />Too many obtuse words that no one uses; too many fabricated words that are never explained. I might be impressed with his vocabulary but certainly not his writing. Glad I didn't buy all three books. I've probably given up on less than 5 books in my 68 years. This one I shut down after 250 tedious pages.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Dear world, I'm a 30-year old woman and I am addicted to playing My Little Pony.<br /><br />I love these games where you build up a town and earn fake money to spend in a fake store to buy more fake stuff to put in your fake world.  It's great, like shopping without spending money.  The problems run when you start spending real money on fake things.  I recently purchased the $4.99 bag of gems to use in the game and the app glitched during the purchase.  I was charged for the purchase but never received the gems.  It is really easy to purchase fake items in the app.  Seriously, just two clicks and you've spent real money.  I think the game makers need to make it a little more difficult for people to spend real money, especially since the game is targeted to children.<br /><br />As some people have said, some of the items are ridiculously high in price.  Like one pony costing over 900 gems.  Gems are really hard to come by so being able to unlock that kind of pony takes purchasing gems.  And the real money it costs to purchase these fake gems is really overpriced.<br /><br />Also, there is no way to receive heart gems in the game without using social networking.  I would like there to be at least the option to purchase heart gems instead of having to beg friends to join.<br /><br />As the game progresses, clearing the dark patches gets more and more expensive which takes longer and longer and longer time to accumulate the coins needed.  Also, some of the shops take two, three, four hours or more before they produce coins again or even twelve hours to build!  I think things should take one hour tops.<br /><br />In all, this game is very fun.  I would like to see things cost less and take less time, but we'll see if the game makers actually listen.  If you are getting it for a child, disable the purchasing in the game so you don't end up with charges you weren't expecting.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Hysterical movie!  I saw it on Netflix, and gave it as a gift for my brother.  It arrived earlier than expected just in time for his birthday.<br />I hope they make many more because Adam Sandler and the rest of the crew were priceless.  I laughed so hard.

B002M5E2DW|3.0|I saw the movie, quite by accident, and was intrigued.  I thought the book would be a little more instructive, but found it mirrored the movie with a bunch of quips.  No real \\"How To\\" was ever given.  Free, ok, but I wouldn't pay for it.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|So, I didn't know what to expect with this show, but I bought it based on the reviews. Its really great, and hard to stop watching. The only thing I will say is that its very sexually charged, wasn't expecting that.
B005LAII3A|1.0|Maybe im wrong but i cannot find the extended version for regular DVD players. Very unhappy when they do this. Not everyone wants to shell out the bucks for a bluray player when they have an extensive and still growong DVD collection. This is their way of trying to get us to get Bluray players. Sad truth is, even though i want to see this, they will simply will see NONE of my money. Wish the right person could see this...lol

B0094BB4TW|4.0|First of all, this Facebook app for the Kindle Fire HD beats the pants off the direct web connection to Facebook via the Silk browser.  That's enough reason alone to at least try this app.<br /><br />The main problem with the direct web connection via the Silk browser was that it was darned difficult to log out.  I'd usually need a dozen taps, even with a stylus, before hitting it jussst right.  Pain in the neck.  This Facebook app solves that problem.  The left sidebar options all work as they should.<br /><br />My only gripes:<br />1. Photos and images are rendered at magnified settings, showing the JPEG artifacts you'd expect to see when viewing a compressed JPEG at around 150% or larger.  You have to tap on the image to see it at the correct screen resolution, then hit the back arrow on the Kindle Fire HD to return to the FB news feed.<br />2. I really miss having access to the Social Fixer plugin for Firefox when using the Kindle Fire HD to browse Facebook.  Not really the fault of this app, but I'm reminded of how cluttered FB is without Social Fixer.<br /><br />Other than those minor nits, thumbs up.

B001V5XV0E|5.0|You just wanna hug Eli, throw her in a hot soapy tub with instructions to not come out until she's really squeaky clean - including those blood encrusted fingernails, young lady - and for god's sake, stop killing the neighbors, you adorable little sociopath.<br /><br />This quiet, addictive movie is marvelous on so many levels.  And it's as faithful to the novel as a standard length movie can be.<br /><br />To sum up, if you're fed up with excessively glamorized depictions of vampires as trivialized by Twilight and adaptations of Ann Rice novels, fear not: Let The Right One In is not in that tepid vein.  It is closer to the grotesque humor and pathos of Coppola's \\"Dracula\\" with Gary Oldman (minus the lavish production and campy melodrama), and to the marvelously cynical \\"Shadow of the Vampire\\" with Willem Dafoe.  Eli is even closer to Dexter, the blood-obsessed tries-to-be-a-good-guy serial killer, than to the typical vampire.  More than just an offbeat vampire movie, it's equally at home in the genre of morality fiction alongside \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as a commentary on childhood bullying and the tribal nature of societies at all ages.<br /><br />Like Dafoe's ferret-faced, anti-glamorous alternative to the familiar suave caped invader cliche, Leandersson's vampirette has not only \\"forgotten how to feel cold\\", she's also forgotten to bathe or wear clean clothes.  Sometimes she doesn't even bother to wear shoes in the snow.  Even after she bathes - prompted by Oskar's \\"You smell funny\\" quip - pay close attention to Eli's hands.  Like any unsupervised pre-adolescent tomboy, she doesn't bother with trivialities like cleaning her fingernails.<br /><br />I probably watched this movie a dozen times while it was available via Amazon Prime's streaming video, including several viewings each of the \\"correct\\" English subtitled version, and the English dubbed version.  My initial reaction to Eli was \\"You manipulative little bitch!\\"  But after second and third viewings the breathtaking nuances of Lina Leandersson's interpretation won me over.  If she never acts again she's accomplished an incredible range of subtle expressions normally seen only in much more experienced young actors.  Without special effects, simply through her odd, puppy-dog-cute face with that too-big nose and ridiculously huge anime eyes and crooked smile, she alternates between simple childlike affection in most scenes with Oskar, to appearing haggard and burdened by too many decades of pitiable existence (notably in the Rubik's Cube and \\"uninvited\\" scenes).  Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) is equally adept at conveying joy, sorrow and the resigned mantle of the victim through subtle facial expressions.<br /><br />Regarding criticisms from other fans about the subtitled and English dubbed versions:<br /><br />First of all, Amazon streaming video has the correct English subtitles by Ingrid Eng.  This version most accurately conveys the subtleties of the dialog, which is quite minimal, often ironic or gently sarcastic.  I have no idea whether the currently available DVD from Magnet has been corrected to include the original subtitles.<br /><br />Secondly, the English dubbed version on Amazon isn't 100% faithful to the Ingrid Eng translation but is close enough.  There were a couple of notable deviations but nothing significant enough to spoil the experience.  For example, Håkan's apology is translated as \\"I'm sorry\\" rather than the nuanced \\"Forgive me\\" that is echoed throughout the film by other characters.  Forgiveness, rather than sorrow, is one of the central themes to LtROI.  And Eli's childlike scrawled notes to Oskar are not translated, either in captions or voiceover.  Eli's notes are quite touching so fans will want to Google around for that bit of trivia.<br /><br />But overall the spoken translations are faithful, including Eli's sarcastic \\"jungle gym\\" reply to Oskar in their first scene together.<br /><br />And the English speaking voices of the kids are very well suited to the actors.  In particular voice actress Robin de Lano's voiceover for Eli perfectly conveys the darker, huskier vocal qualities the director wanted in the Swedish language original.  Trivia buffs will recall that Lina Leandersson's voice was overdubbed as well in the original Swedish language version to achieve a lower pitched, somewhat less overtly feminine character.  When comparing both it's remarkable how well the English speaking actress conveys Eli's personality, with her nuances of weary ennui and moments of awkward childlike enthusiasm.<br /><br />So, purists for the Ingrid Eng translation should be satisfied with the English dubbed version, which may be a better way to introduce this excellent movie to folks who dislike subtitles.<br /><br />Without venturing too far into spoilers regarding the sexuality and orientations of the various characters, if I could find any fault in the movie, it may be that an opportunity was missed to comment on the story's core: It's about the nearly unsolvable puzzle of relationships, a bit of irony in itself since puzzles - one of Eli's fascinations - are visual themes scattered throughout the movie.  However, since the author of the novel also wrote the screenplay and had final say on story elements he considered essential, it's probably safe to say that the sexual identities of these two 12 year olds - even the 12 year old who's been 12 years old for a very long time - matter less than the fact that these two misfit puzzle pieces simply found each other.ed to the actors.

B0096HK46S|5.0|I first saw Re-Animator in theaters during its first run, including on the midnight movie circuit while I was in college.  Since then I've rewatched it maybe once every 10 years.  It still holds up well.  I'd rank it alongside the original &#34;Fright Night&#34; as one of the 1980s classic horror movies, particularly for fans of dark humor.<br /><br />Overall the cast and acting are well above par for this genre.  Bruce Abbott and Barbara Crampton are at least adequate and even fairly good in the horror caricature types of the ill-fated lovers - think, Jonathan and Mina from Dracula.  Jeffrey Combs inhabits this genre and character type like he was born for it.  Robert Sampson and, in particular, David Gale, excel in difficult roles that demand sudden shifts in approach midway through the movie.  Sampson transitions from a staid caricature of the stuffy upper crust type to believably pitiable and sympathetic after an experiment gone badly awry.  The normally aristocratic Gale, of course, steals the second half of the show, losing his head but then generously offering it to Crampton's character in one of the most infamous and hilariously grotesque scenes in movie history.  I can still recall theater audiences roaring in uncomfortable laughter, at least during the 1980s midnight movie run.<br /><br />I was never a big fan of Lovecraft so I'm not bothered by the departure from the source material that might annoy purists.  If anything, Lovecraft's occasional ventures into satirical commentary on other writers and eras indicate he might actually enjoy this movie version.  It's certainly been more effective than most movies based on Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, perhaps in part because those movies lack the dark humor of Re-Animator.
0060558121|5.0|I don't usually read these sort of books because I don't stray from my usual genres, but I've got to say I was surprised. If I didn't have to read this novel for writing class, I would have never picked it up. This book was a really good read, and the author Neil Gaiman managed to infuse so much meaning behind every little thing/ event that he created in the book. Gaiman pulled me in during the first chapter, by shocking me with his writing, and continued to hold my attention with the odd events occurring around the protagonist. The plot of the novel continued to remain in a veil of mystery to me until the very end with its twisted turn of events. I enjoyed reading it, and seeing how Gaiman uses this book to compare and contrast to the present-day America. In the end, Gaiman will have you thinking about the themes that were evident throughout this novel. It was different; not to say the least.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should make another game like this one it rocks!<br />Maybe it could be like a building jump game. Did I mention this game is awesome!
B006C1DH92|5.0|Fruit Ninja: Puss in Boots edition has two different modes: Bandito Mode and Desperado Mode. Both are fun and addictive. I personally think that Bandito Mode adds a great challenge and improves the game tremendously.<br /><br />In Desperado Mode, it is the classic Fruit Ninja, you have three lives. Slice as many fruits as you can. Every fruit you drop counts against your lives. The game is over when you dropped 3 fruits (thus lose all of your lives) or slice a bomb. Magic beans can give you +25 points when your health is full, otherwise it will give you extra heart.<br /><br />In Bandito Mode, you are presented with 3 levels of short challenges (such as slice 25 fruits in 10 seconds, crack a coconut, etc.) and a final level. These short challenges are randomized, so you never know what you will really get. That's why I think this takes away some of the repetitions. Again, you have three lives, but in this mode, there is no magic bean to give you extra heart. Your score in this mode is cumulative based on the how many fruits you have sliced, how fast your initial reaction was, and combos in each level. I should mention that misses count against your score, and if you fail a challenge, you will receive no point for that particular challenge.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great buy. You will spend hours and hours slicing fruits. So, what are you waiting for? Get it and enjoy!!

B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Sinister manages to combine a well-trodden hacked-together plot with some sub-par production values that even Ethan Hawke can't save. The story is about a crime writer who moves his family into a house where a previous family was murdered (seriously) and you can guess what happens from there. There are some super-8 snuff movies for extra value, all of which look like they were shot at some indie film school.<br /><br />There's so much wrong with this film that it's hard to know where to start. At the basic level, it's really not scary - the ghost children have horrible make-up and the main scary guy (called Boogie) looks like a cheap Halloween mask. The lighting is so bad that you can't see enough from scene to scene. The music is distracting. The logic is weak and character motivations lacking. Ethan's token British wife is a very weak actress who provides little more than exposition. And despite being such a short flick, it feels overlong.<br /><br />I didn't find a single idea or plot device that hasn't been \\"borrowed\\" from better horror films. I know that newbie directors like to shoot horror because it's cheap to make but when they don't know how to handle the genre, you end up with a mixed up mess that fails to scare.

006113399X|4.0|This book is about a detective called Harry Hole who is trying to find the importer of a high power rifle and the reason for it.As such we are taken back into WW 2 involving the relationship between Daniel Gudeson,Sindre Fauke,Gudbrad Johansen and Hallgrim Dale who are Norweigien but fought together for the Germans.<br /><br />The story is fast moving, a great plot but gets a bit confusing with too many characters,and one character taking the place of another(I wont say anymore) and also having a split personality so at times is one person and then another .Confused?? Read the book.<br /><br />The disapointment is that all is fantastic but after keeping track to all the clues all is revealed in a diary that Harry Hole finds(Pg.553 to Pg.594). As such Harry the 1st Class investigator did not solve the mystery of Rifles,Interchanging Characters and hidden clues by his own detective skills but just finds all the answers in a Diary written by the culpit.<br /><br />As such the big Bang didn't come to me in the form of OMG but just oh is that why!!<br /><br />Overall i still give it 4 out of 5 and will definately endeavour to read all others.

B00992CF6W|4.0|On creative all you get is bLoCkS.Can you even go to the Neather on this?It's a cool game.Other thing it has endless worlds!I don't like endless worlds.I know it's the pocket edition but it's a cool game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is a very good game that is very addicting. it is so much fun. I thought minecraft was weird at first but is actually really really fun.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|The best youtube downloader i have ever had and it really works,I would reccomend this to my friends because it is so reliable
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is great for our grandsons they play with it for hours very time they come over it was easy to down load.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|I keep hearing about this movie and how fantastic it is for young kids. Totally recommend to everyone. Its fantastic!
B00BF8OYJO|5.0|I liked this short story.  Agatha Raisin is her usual shrewed best, and the crime is satisfactorily sorted out.  a charming little cameo.
B0063FGFK0|5.0|Lots of interesting extras in this three disc set. Perfect for anyone who loved this film. Love the extedned cut, also includes an alternative ending, although I think any fan of the film prefers the theatrical ending.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|I don't need to add to the vast number of reviews of this book.  I just want to say how much I enjoyed the scientific side of this.  If a successful neurosurgeon is prepared to put his career on the line by writing a book of this sort, there has to be something we need to know in the subject. I found it reassuring.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It's made me jump a few times. Careful around corners and don't forget your blood pressure meds. Great free app of the day, would have paid.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I knew going in to Django Unchained that I was in for a Tarantino movie and all that entails. I knew there’d be clever dialogue, over-acting, Samuel L. Jackson, an awesome mish-mosh soundtrack, revenge, a cameo by the writer/director, and oceans of blood. I wasn’t disappointed.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx channeled a simmering intensity coupled with dead pan smart a$$ ala Clint Eastwood, Leonardo DiCaprio and Don Johnson were over-the-top bad guys, Samuel L. was, well, his usual self, and Christoph Waltz steals the show as a German bounty hunter. Unfortunately, the beautiful Kerry Washington is under written, but there are really no strong female characters in this movie at all.<br /><br />The film is nearly three hours and is probably about thirty minutes too long, but it still moves quickly enough that you aren’t squirming in your seat. Additionally, in the best western tradition, there are breathtaking shots of scenery to balance out the trademark explosions of blood and guts. It gets a bit intense with a few scenes, but again, you’re watching a Tarantino flick, not the latest from Nancy Meyers.<br /><br />Aside – I’m surprised so many took time to review this movie and rail about how silly and unbelievable it was. I didn’t see a “based on a true story” line in the opening credits. If you watch this looking for holes in the plot or strict realism, you clearly don’t have much knowledge of what this writer/director does. If you do, you’re likely to enjoy Django Unchained immensely, as I did.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was a very well written first person story of survival.  I found the descriptions of the science behind the story to be clear and not so technical to be boring.  I read this start to finish almost all in one sitting- a great page turner.
1476712042|5.0|Can't wait for the second book. I read it in a day. The character's chemistry and friendships were intriguing. Great author!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyed the characters. it was easy to immerse myself into storyline. Would recommend this romance to others. Defiantly a good story to read in spare time.
B00136JT3Y|5.0|I love that I can get great songs at a nice value and then yorr music is stored in the cloud
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|Very entertaining and pleasant . Good view for the whole family, Recomend this for a good family night show and discussion
B00005R2IS|5.0|Purchased this DVD along w/others for my husband.  They were perfectly wrapped, no torn or damaged boxes.  The DVD quality was at the top, no skips or fuzzy pictures.  Well worth the lowered prices!Satisfied in Chicago
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great DVD, he loves the James Bond series and am excited to give this to him for his birthday this year.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this show!!! Can't wait for the 3 season<br />I wish there would be more shows like this one to watch
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Great CD, he loves the James Bond series and am excited to give this to him for his birthday this year.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Really fun and scary 2 huge maps full of locations to look for pages easy is too easy stick to medium for easy and hard for more of a challenge
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This product downloaded fast and was easy to access for my students! It's a hilarious movie and had a great time watching it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written. The story is fascinating and the work done by the SEALS is admirable. The message is right on target.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Loved the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series years ago, and had to wait this long to discover a new, fresh, modern Sherlock that absolutely tops it.  Love the chemistry between Sherlock  & Watson, the banter, the well-produced, well-thought-out storylines.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|If it was possible, I would rate this book 4.5 stars. The storyline was great and a lot of loose ends were tied up but the ending surprised me. I could see where the future was headed for society and its characters but I just felt it was very anticlimactic. Other than that, I enjoyed every bit of it. I also thought it was clever how the story constantly jumped from both Lena's and Hana's points of view. I can see myself reading this series again.
B0081336FO|5.0|The best Sherlock series continues in season 2.  Enjoying the homage to Doyle's original stories.  Witty, edge-of-your-seat entertainment.  Holmes aficionadoes, search no further.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game its great I recommend getting it but what I don't like is all the advertisings its great other then that
B004YOEFG8|5.0|Ecellent video well done best to view in 3d WE ARE NOT ALONE come to mind This is a new way to see how it all began surely best video in this class
B0050DIWFC|3.0|It is an easy book to read. The story, which is a good one, moves along rapidly and keeps one interested. Some of the mystery is a bit too obvious. I think the story was made into a movie, and I suspect a hour long movie might be a better way to tell the story.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I love this game, definitely worth the money paid. It could use an update, though, like putting your games in &quot;extended development&quot;.<br />And maybe remove the fourteen character limit?<br />Still, great game, five stars :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app.<br />my daughter loves this app. lots of cool horses unicorns and a zebra!<br />The photography feature is really cool.  My daughter and I are very happy.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is a must have! When I first got it, I had collected 3/8 pages and hadn't seen Slender Man but when I turned around, he was right there! I dropped my Kindle, he was walking! My only sort of bad comment is when you exit out of the game, sometimes the Kindle freezes for a little bit, but it's only for a few seconds and the 'Slender Man' text sticks for a bit while viewing your Kindle carousel. It doesn't last long so, I can live with it. Love this app!
0762445262|4.0|Sits at my desk at work, because I need a hero. My boss is not amused by this. Ha Ha
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I  love this app and usually play it once or twice a week. I even spent 99 cents on the game to purchase a character and don't regret it! It's so challenging though, but so addictive when you start playing it. I really love this game even though I don't play it 24/7. Love it!
B007ZUTQ1C|4.0|Several years ago, after taking a sabbatical, Robert Silverberg returned to speculative fiction with the highly successful fantasy epic Lord Valentine's Castle. George R.R. Martin seems to have followed Silverberg's example with his own entry in the epic fantasy field: A Game of Thrones.<br />Westeros, the world of A Game of Thrones, is loosely based on the fifteenth century Wars of the Roses England, right down to the map of the Seven Kingdoms, which is ruled by the usurper king Robert Baratheon.  Although Robert and Eddard Stark, around whose family the novel revolves, have been friends since they were young men, they have grown apart since the war that placed Robert on the throne.  Eddard, content to remain with his family in the north, is summoned by King Robert to come to the south and help rule the kingdom as the King’s Hand.<br /><br />At the beginning of the novel, many of the characters grow into sympathetic individuals, particularly the Starks of Winterfell.  However, ill fortune and manipulation, seem to plague the Starks to the extent that the novel begins to foreshadow many evils falling upon the Starks.  At the same time, many political enemies, whom become caricatures rather than characters, begin to mount in front of the Starks.  These evildoers are so unrepentant that they don’t seem as intriguing as the characters fighting against them.  Martin goes to great lengths to portray the political situation, which put those characters, most notably the Lannisters, into their positions.  I will probably get slaughtered for saying this, but if Martin put a little more effort into these characters they could have become more realistic and move A Game of Thrones further away from the genre’s norms.<br /><br />Martin does break with a lot of the High Fantasy tropes that have become overly accepted within the genre.  I particularly loved the idea that, although it appears that some form of magic does exist in the world, no great magics are performed.  The novel becomes more realistic and plays out like a historical novel, which is a nice change of pace.  In fact, Martin’s strength in A Game of Thrones is his ability to portray a realistic and complex political situation.<br /><br />At times, Martin’s writing style is reminiscent of a juvenile.  Not as much in the prose, rather the development of the youthful protagonists.  This tone, however, is completely incongruous with graphic violence and sex in almost every other scene.  In fact, their juxtaposition serves to highlight of the mature nature of the violence.<br /><br />The novel, thankfully, is plot driven and not character driven.  Furthermore, his characters, which are well drawn, do not pose as characters that will help progress the story.  There are about three characters in the novel, out of dozens, who become interesting and intriguing.<br /><br />Due to the fact that I have read A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, I can say that the series does get gradually better with each installment.novel becomes more realistic and plays out like a historical novel, which is a nice change of pace.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is the best.I like how it is 3d.I wasn't that scared but it is the best slender game I've played.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I loved it.<br />Hope E L James has more to come.Could not put these books down wanted more disappointing when I finished.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|If you think about buying this book, the answer is yes. Yes yes yes. This book is amazing.  I would recommend
B008I43DYU|1.0|It doesn't convert to landscape mode so I can't use the scientific calculator. So I can only give it one star
0062238868|5.0|A true account of a true hero! Chris leaves behind a razor sharp account of his days as a U.S. sniper.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|its great for my kids and its simple for my younger kid, it has a lot of dishes too, a 4 star review
0838577016|4.0|THANK FOR SALE, 'm Happy with the book, very well thanks Until next time, have a happy day. until next
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|great tv, i want to have Michael Chiklis and i'm a straight dude! great tv, great plots and subplots, great tv
B00AGKHFCA|4.0|Not as well liked as his previous records, still great. Noone sings quite as well as Bocelli. What an awesome voice.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|I ordered &#34;My Fair Lady&#34;  because my granddaughter is interested in musicals.  I have always loved this one.  And my granddaughter loved it too.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|The role of Prospero has now become Prospera, so Shakespeare's tale is now slightly tweaked to be a mother/daughter tale.  The setting, being a rather barren island allows the viewer to focus on the story itself rather than lots of visual clutter, although there are excellent FX scenes for eye candy.  The costumes are wonderfully done, and more than appropriate to the theme.<br /><br />It is a shame that this excellent production apparently went nowhere in the box office, leaving me to wonder if the film distributor and marketing people did their part.  This certainly deserves to be seen by a wider audience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun everyone should play its so fun i had to give it five stars so lets go surfing!
B009LDD54K|5.0|the film makers have managed to maintain the superior quality of this series.  i always look forward to the next season
B00APUQH0W|5.0|As a sports nut I really enjoyed this movie. It is one to add to the collection.  Wonderful movie for all.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|So basically it was the free app of the day, and I recognized Slendy, so I figured &quot;Why not?&quot; My dad and I died on the first note,  so then on our next game we got up to like 6/8 and he turned around and he was RIGHT THERE. I screamed and fell off my chair and said &quot; RUN!! YOU BETTER RUN OR SLENDY GONNA GET YA!&quot; Oh my God,  it was scary!! Then,  after a little while,  we were like walking backwards. SLENDER. WAS. RIGHT. THERE. The creepiest thing about it was that he disappeared when we walked past this tree. Next,  he was at the bottom of the hill,  then he was standing directly in front of us,  and it was game over. I totally recommend this game to anyone who likes a good scare,  and you wont be dissapointed. The graphics are really cool and the sounds are creepy as heck! Just don't ever turn around!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Box is solid and nice to have. Watching all in 1080p is awesome, although it is strange on some of the movie effects that were really not supposed to be seen with such clarity.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|At first when you see the trailer B&W it is a little off putting with so many kids movies being so colorful.  This was very good and a lot of fun for the family.  Has a few nods to the old Universial Moster movies that insipired it as well.  The 3d was perfect and well suited for this movie if you have enjoyed any of Burtons other syop motion this is right up there a whole world better then corpses bride.
B00979CS50|5.0|First, I must admit, I was pretty skeptical about this new album. I'm a big fan of his early 70s stuff, but didn't really follow after 'Freedom' or 'Mirror Ball' with Pearl Jam. So when Americana came out, I was excited at his reunion with Crazy Horse, but not ecstatic upon the listening of that album. \\"Psychedelic Pill\\", however, takes our ears and mind on a trip back to those Crazy Horse days, the days we all know and love from Neil. The first song, \\"Drifting Back\\", a whopping 20 min+ is enough to carry you back to Young's roots. Anyone listening to this album can just imagine that this is good, ol'fashioned Neil Young and Crazy Horse back to their basics. It is a must-have for the fan of hardrock/folk Neil. Definitely one of the best of the year.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I had no want to see this at all.  One day just watched it because it was on.  Very good movie enjoyed it.  nothing like the sparkel power vamp movie and I have no clue why it has even been compared to them. The acting is good J-Law is good for this role.  I have never read the books but solely from a movie watchers point of view on this one at least it sets up everything for the world and series to make you want more.
B003YL4L0W|2.0|It was recommended by someone who had not read it but I didn't know that at the time. I didn't like the subject matter. It was for a book club but I think it will bring political and religious opinions into the discussion which I think could be divisive.
B007JVJ3C4|3.0|Was ok to just watch and enjoy.  The 3d is almost flat fore the whole movie  with only two stand outs that make you remember it is 3d.  This was better then the first which I know is not saying a whole lot.
B00942X8PY|5.0|I am always looking for a challenging puzzle game.  Some of my favorite ones are code breaker, quell, and doodle fit.  This game is not like other puzzle games i played, so it keeps me interested.  It suits my taste and I enjoy playing it.  Graphics are very good.  I recommend this game if you like puzzle games.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I've played pet story, zoo story 2, and now dragon story. I enjoy dragon story the most, because the issue i had with the aforementioned games has been addressed with dragon age: instead of having to buy gold to acquire rare animals, I have the option of breeding them. Granted, buying them is the quickest route, however, I thoroughly like this new option. The primary problem I noticed is that expanding is difficult due to what seems like an inconsistency in the cost to remove various pieces of foliage.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|This is an underated visual masterpiece. The colors are so vivid and the car races are awesome.  I know that some will say the movie wasn't an Oscar contender, but it is a good movie that is visually stimulating.  Excellent remake and live action movie.  It's a fun &#34;ride&#34;.  Late.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Yes, its pace is not like more recent movies.  However, this movie has aged well and my middle schoolers enjoyed watching this with me as I reminisced about seeing this the first time many, many years ago.  Fun movie, still.
B00664BWI8|5.0|Well done and fun, fun, fun. Just started watching last month and went through them all and caught up to this current season. Enjoyed watching them all over the last month instead of watching one a week.<br />Love the characters and good acting. Wish they hadn't killed off Aunt Jenna tho....liked her character/actress and thought she brought a nice touch to the series.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|i like it. it's a movie. it's a movie with a lizard. I liked it. maybe you'll like it too.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|As a long time reader of the fantasy genre I have to say that Morgan Rice delivers a great series with the Sorcer's ring. The books are an easy read and keep the reader captivated and wanting more the entire time. Even though they are short they are a very fun read and worth it. Can't wait until book four comes out!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love it. perfect for when I go to the grocery store... and to add my bills up...... definately download this app
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the perfect ending to the perfect trilogy. I love happy endings. I love that there was more of a plot.
B002UXRGM0|1.0|I bought this blu-ray, the UK version of LIFE, in the US website of Amazon and it does not work.  I searched the web, and this problem was apparently known, but it is not mentioned on the website to advise the customer.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|is very good, good for gaming, my first time building a pc and nothing went wrong, i even OC it to 4.2 but it began to reach the 80s and 90s so i downclock it to 4.0 GHz it runs at good temps, but because i don't want it to run hot i left it on stock for now
B009157BWU|5.0|This movie I really enjoyed. End up buying the movie. I would tell a friend or family member to watch.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I was skeptical about this app since it is such a simple premise - simply find matching mini-cubes that comprise a larger cube.  It is actually an enjoyable and relaxing time killer.  Manipulating the large cube to access matches on the different faces of the cube works well and the 3D effect is nice. The challenge is completely eliminating the cube in the shortest period of time and high scores are retained.  Alternative games offered include a reverse cube - starting with just a few matched set of mini cubes, you must eliminate the cubes that keep appearing before the full cube is formed- and a 1 minute game, where you clear as many pairs from the full cube as you can in 1 minute.<br />Well worth a buck.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I think I am one of the few people that like the originals and the new ones! This was close to original Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. But just like the Planet of the Apes remake, it has a lot more hope than the originals. And I like that. The originals all had very dark endings except the finale, Battle for the Planet of the Apes, the only one to end with some hope. So with great special effects and a more hope filled story line, I will always like both old and new in different ways.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I have no idea how anyone could review this thing positively.  It is soooooooo boring and repetitive.  The controls are annoying, the music annoying, the graphics would have been good in 1998, not so much in 2013. There is nothing scary about this, except that after you download it and play it, you fear that the time you wasted could have been used more productively-like napping or killing yourself or something.  Don't bother, it is overpriced at free.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't stop once I started until I finished the entire novel !!!! Can't wait to start the next installment !!! Nail biter to gutwrencher!!!!!
B006BXTOFC|4.0|El Camino is a good album by the Black Keys. It's much faster and a little more poppy than previous albums, but it doesn't lose its charm that way. Many of the songs will likely get stuck in your head.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|my only issue is that its a generic facebook app and of course- you have to pay money to accomplish anyyhing. but other than that it has great graphics and runs pretty well on my kindle fire
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game, it makes you think hard and even if you dint get it there's a hint button ( on casual mode ) great game :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this book.Great read and characters.  Wil be reading more books that she has written.  love my kindle for bringing me such great books
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun!!you get to go to different places like New York,Rio,and Rome.if I rated this game on a scale from 1 to 10,it would be an 11.that's how awesome this game is!!
0064431622|5.0|It is a wonderful story on excepting yourself for who and what you are. I read it to my preschool classroom often but is a good reminder for all ages on excepting ourselves!
B00AL1ONN8|3.0|Big fan of TI. He did go back to his old style but all in all, I can nod my head to it.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|This adaptation of slender is a great attempt at capturing the ambiance of the original. Sadly, the touch controls cut out far too often for me. Keep trying, dev.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|I felt the lyrics and beats were great. Definitely don't regret purchasing this album! i have listened to this album about 10 or more times already.
1439170916|5.0|This book is by far the most informative book I have read on the subject of cancer and it's treatment throughout the centuries.  It's a narative that is easily understood by the average reader and is facinating in it's detail of cancer and it's treatments through all ages known to mankind.  I found myself engrossed in the book every time I picked it up to read.  I generally do not really enjoy reading materials dealing with medical matters or research of any kind, I found that this book kept my interest to the extent that I had to sometimes make myself put it down so I could carry on my day to day activities.  Probably the only negative thing I could say about it is that is is very long and requires concentration to a greater extent than the mysteries or historical novels I usually read.  I would recommend this Book to anyone interested in learning about what has happened throughout time in the pursuit of a cause and/or cure for cancer.  In fact I intend to purchase copies for a couple of my dear friends who are cancer survivors like me.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I loved this app billion star rating! then...my fri kin parents destroyed my accownt now I have a better one love this app so cute
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin dozer is totally fun and addictive for all ages. There's no other way I'd rather spend a lazy day than playing coin dozer!
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I have loved Ennio Morricone's music ever since I saw the film The MIssion.  The glorious oboe solo &#34;Gabriel's Oboe&#34; blew me away.  I also think the cello has the most beautiful and mellow sound of all the strings.  BUT...put the two together and you have the absolute perfect combination...like chocolate and peanut butter!  I will play this CD often!
B00942X8PY|1.0|How do you not put instructions for this game?  Do you not put on underwear before you go out?  Do you not wear pants?<br /><br />What's the point on playing a game with no instructions???!
B005CRY2O6|3.0|In the ingredients list of the kindle book, it is often not clear which ingredients belong to what part of the recipe becuse the ' subtitles' are missing. For example, when reading the recipe, it says mix the ingredients fot the sauce together, while in the ingredients list it is not clear what goes into the sauce and what goes into the main. Sometimes it starts with a subtitle ' sauce' but then it does not show where the ingredients for the main dish starts.<br />Too much of a puzzle to make it an easy choice to cook from. I hope they will fix it.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|We started with the free version but ended up purchasing the full version. Very educational, easy to use, great graphics. Glad be found it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This kept my interest from the beginning.  The style in which it was written matched the story perfectly, really really really good!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this is a great game but i have had trouble with this loading up. I have removed it twice and downloaded it again and I still have the same problem.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I down loaded the angry birds because I have it on my i-Pad at work and I love it, however it isn't the same game.  I wanted the piggy game and that one did not down load to my device at home.
B001DPC4SM|5.0|One of the best creative albums from the state of Minnesota. Prince is very underrated because of the focus on his bizzaro life but the man can flat out play.
B0086700CM|3.0|I don't play this game, I down loaded this for my grand children, they seem to like it and play it often.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Its a cute game really fun and they enjoy it what more can I ask. Entertain and it is not one ofbthose games where they learn constant violence.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The Pinterest app is easy to use because they made it simple. It loads fast on my lenovo tablet using android.  Thanks!
1451688091|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin should receive a Pulitzer for this body of work. The amount of research coupled with her interesting style of writing make this a classic portrait of the men who worked and guided us through our most dangerous crisi as a country. The movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; does not do justice to this book. I would love to see a television mini-series for the entire book.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Good book. 18 more words required so now i'm just writing stuff. I hope your day is going well. Thank you for reading this, but honestly it's a good book.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I did enjoy this game, however I would have liked it more I  you could view the notes you collected. I still enjoyed it none the less. Also, the screen flipping was way out of controlling.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|Product arrived on time and in good condition.  We had been looking to aquire this dvd for a while now in order to complete our Saw collection set. This is one of the best prices we found and we had looked around through multiple stores and websites.
1935182617|5.0|This book provided many good examples, plus good references, and lots of good examples. It covered all the things that are important, plus others. It gave me all I needed.
B00817UPU4|5.0|Haven't started reading it yet. Just finished the 3rd in the series. But if it is anything like the others I will like it.
B004IFYMYI|4.0|A must have for your home DVD collection.  My family had never seen it.  I bought it and could remember why it has been remembered through the years.  Excellent film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A little laggy sometimes but I love the game!! I'm a horse lover but never. got a real one' this partially helps
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is a fantastic series.  It is well acted, well directed, and the stories keep you on the edge of your seat.  I can't say too much in here or I will spoil someone's fun but it is well worth watching.
B005H9B44A|3.0|It was okay for a super hero story. Very much weaker than Ironman or Spiderman. I was expecting something more inspirational.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I play this one all the time.  It is addictive.  I find it a great way to relax at the end of a hard day.  The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't allow me to purchase a version that doesn't have advertisements.  Those ads are very annoying.
B000PH40HM|5.0|A great movie that does not take itself too seriously. Shame it was not popular enough to have had a sequel.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Love the movie.  I saw it in the theaters and had to purchase the DVD for our collection at home.
B004SBQALA|5.0|I love this movie saw in theater and on cable this particular DVD wouldn't play in my blue ray player I just never contacted Amazon if I had they would have replaced it immediately but  it played in my daughters I gave it to her instead.
B009BJATYS|4.0|I am a huge fan of the version of Emma starring Jeremy Northam and Gwyneth Paltrow. That version is perfection. I would have given this three stars but the movie picked up on some aspects from the book that are really well done making it good enough for four stars. Plus I love Romola Garai. She is such a great actress. She is amazing in Daniel Deronda with Hugh Dancy.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game! I enjoy that their are no adds between levels. Much harder trying to get 3 stars in each round
0307277453|5.0|I picked up this book because as a yoga teacher I'm on the look out for work that will help me understand Human Anatomy. This book is a real gem.  Unlike some of the books that are filled with diagrams of skeletons and lymph systems, this book had complete paragraphs and explanations.  Dr. Shubin writes in a familiar engaging style, much like a friendly uncle and not like a dry professor.  For example he describes himself as having \\"ants in his pants\\" excitement. I thought that was cute.  I'm a bit of a yoga dork myself, so I appreciate him admitting how passionate he is about his chosen field.  I was also interested in his detailed description of field work.  Who knew?  Eight days of planning go into one day of field work when the field is located 250 miles from anything else, accessible only by helicopter!<br /><br />A couple of specific things: one reviewer wrote \\"If you think that humans have a special place in the universe, or even that someone created them on purpose, you probably won't like this book.\\"  That gave me pause.  If you think humans have a special place in the universe I wish you would give this book a read.  If it makes people a little less species-ist I am all for it.  Dr. Shubin doesn't bang you on the head with his world views, he merely reports the facts.  Transitional species fossils have been discovered for over 150 years, the first being found two years after Darwin published. So for Creationists to keep declaring \\"No 'missing link' has ever been found\\" is incorrect.<br /><br />If you have a dearly cherished belief, and upon receiving more information you realize your belief may be incorrect, I say it's time to reconsider based on the new facts.  Information is good not bad!  I remember when the Creationists in my small town showed a movie at the community center which reported that even invertebrate animals were so complex that the only explanation is Intelligent Design.  That movie stated more than once that no transitional fossil record existed.  The movie was very convincing, but absolutely incorrect.  Sir Richard Dawkins mentions the film in his book \\"The God Delusion.\\"  I figure if people have to lie to win an argument that does't bode well.<br /><br />I suppose the Intelligent Design crowd could claim that the Scientists are lying - but when you go to the museum of Natural History in Chicago and see fossils for yourself the evidence seems irrefutable. What does religion have on it's side except truth by declaration? Calling a pig a dog doesn't make it so.<br /><br />One wag wrote on the internet \\"Science flies you to the moon, religion flies you into skyscrapers.\\"<br /><br />This book is written at a middle school level, interesting enough for an adult, but hardly bogged down with big words. A twelve year old could read this.  Another reviewer questioned who is the target market for this book. Several people complained that it is basic. I enjoy books that bring an arcane subject down to a general view.  IF you are expecting more, you will need to read something else.  This book is an overview.existed.

0062082353|5.0|Very few books keep my interest but this is one I couldn't put down. If you are interested in what it takes to be a sniper this is a must read.
B00942X8PY|5.0|I've been playing this for the past 2 hours..... I really like it. Clean looking graphics and smooth play. A lot like Flow but with some fun twists. And everyone that thinks the game has denigrating comments....... Get over yourself.....
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just love to be able to have my books available wherever specially last week when i spent 1 week on jury duty.  i had 2 hour lunches and a lot of down time waiting for lawyers to agree on what we could/or could not have presented to us, it was a blessing!
B008K6HN8I|2.0|First, I would like to say, that it is functional; Second, it does not appear to be well organized or well thought out.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is so good and well thought out that I often regret using most hand calculators when my kindle is not nearby. Is this available as a free app for Windows PCs also?
B004S3MB2U|4.0|The best and most complete calculator yet. It takes a while to learn though because it has so many functions.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Not the first, nor the last, Reacher novel I read.  Thrilling and entertaining as the rest.  A good read that you can't put down.
B00942X8PY|4.0|If you've played games like Flow or Trainyard, this game won't be entirely foreign for you. It's a bread and butter puzzle game at its core, but this one has a little flair.<br /><br />The objective is to fill up the space with the colors, but each color has a specific amount of moves and they have to be in a line. You can't fill in one square with blue and then another square across the map with the same color. You have to make your way there.<br /><br />Then there are things like warps, move increase and decrease blocks and much more to contend with.<br /><br />Early on, it's deceptively tough. There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason as to where the difficult levels are placed. At times, I solved 10-straight puzzles, only to be stumped on another for several minutes.<br /><br />The game has a nice, sleek style. There's a little bit of humor in there as well, which you'll see. Runs great, very smooth with buttery controls. It doesn't get me addicted like Flow did though, and that's probably because this requires a bit more thought.<br /><br />A great candidate for the Free App of the Day, but worth the price of admission if you miss out. Recommended.
0451418441|5.0|\\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is one of the finest novels that I have ever had the privilege of reading. It seemed inconceivable to me that Ken Follett could possibly follow up his medieval masterpiece with a worthy successor (even considering the fact that it took him 18 years to do so). I'm happy to report that Follett has performed the unthinkable... he did it. Somehow, he pulled it off.<br /><br />When I first began reading \\"World\\", it failed to enrapture me as thoroughly as the travels and trials of Tom Builder and family in \\"Pillars\\". The politics of the religious authorities failed to grip me, and I couldn't help but feel a tad let down. Nonetheless, I plowed on, since I went into the experience fully knowing how obscenely good \\"Pillars\\" was, and understanding that virtually nothing could live up to the standard set forth by that beautiful piece of historical fiction. I'm glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />As it turns out, \\"World\\" is just as good as its predecessor, if not better. It is so masterfully crafted, so majestically inspired, any words I might render to describe its quality would be vastly inadequate. It is, quite simply, one of the very finest novels I have ever read. Very rarely will I feel such empathy for the characters of fiction, in spite of their overwhelming flaws. Follett's skill is so great, he created sympathy within me even for the reprehensible villains of \\"World\\"... his writing is just that good. I can't tell you how he does it... I can only tell you that he does.<br /><br />In a turn of fan service that is nothing short of genius, Follett has created several characters that are \\"companions\\" to \\"Pillars\\", the novel that occurred two centuries previous. Ralph is essentially William, Mirthen is Jack, and so forth (my apologies for any spelling errors, as I digested this book via the excellent audio edition). Even minor characters, such as henchman Walter (from \\"Pillars\\") receive a parallel character in \\"World\\".<br /><br />\\"World Without End\\" is one of the best books I've ever read. Any fan of fiction will take pleasure in it... and if you're not a reader, this just might be the book that turns you into one.ne of the best books I've ever read. Any fan of fiction will take pleasure in it... and if you're not a reader, this just might be the book that turns you into one.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's easy and fun! There are different levels for different challenges. And hints to help out and options to play the board differently
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Such a good Bond movie!  Loved it, even though it was sad.  Don't want to give any spoilers to those who haven't seen it yet.  Daniel Craig is such a wonderful James Bond.  Music was amazing...
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I came here to get this, the older version of tgis app because I made the mistake of updating from the play store a few weeks ago. The updated version was horrible. Slow and confusing and almost impossible to use. The only thing better about the updated version is the radar is better  that is My only complaint about this version, the radar does not work too well. I wish that would just give this version a better radar and be done with it. Then it would be 5 stars.
B003BM374K|3.0|However, the movie was pretty good.  Had a bit of a difficulty understanding the lines.  I don't know if it was due to sound issues or my hearing issues!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just started this game, and I love it. It leads you through everything... and when I don't remember to take care of my horse, it sends notifications to my tablet! That's amazing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's Temple Run all over again, but better. The graphics are amazing... much better than the original Temple Run. Instead of 3 monkeys, it's one HUGE monkey. I highly recommend this app.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I loved from the start and can hardly put it down. It has kept my attention from the beginning. It is my go to game to pass the time
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|a fun game. enjoyable. and some of it scared me. I say many people will like it just like me
B0086700CM|5.0|it was a great game and i loved it.  i would tell others to get this game.  I play this game every day.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Jeffrey Archer back to his best .Well written with few dull moments .Although there is naturally a delay between each publication he cleverly summarizes the previous series ,thus although they have all been great to read ,one could probably get by if the first two novels were not available
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i like this game even more the first one.  i would tell others to get this game.  i spend hour on this game , it is so good.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|on my second try I got 7 pages then died but it was so scary, especially when playing in the dark!  great game and very spooky!
159315724X|5.0|This book could change everyones life.  I would recomend this book to everyone.  I am starting to very slowly change things in my own life.  I already feel much better about myself.
B008N1V11U|2.0|It was fun and the graphics were great but it crashed.I went back on after it crashed and the whole main story was gone. All that was still there was the dumb side stories. I don't know if its a glitch or a scam.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This may be my favorite book of all time (and I don't say that lightly.) It had everything I could ask for: a compelling hero, a story line that carries you from one exciting crisis to the next, fascinating supporting characters, and a world built of imagination that is both fantastical and believable, thanks to the writing talent of the author. I laughed, I cried, I loved it. As soon as I closed the cover on this book, I was opening the cover of the second in the series, and now I am impatiently waiting for the third book! An excellent read.
B008VBYN80|5.0|After a month it  loaded FINALLY loaded up and I'm sorry about the terrible things I said! I loved it a lot!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has turned into one of my favorite writers and someone I know I can turn to for good, solid entertainment. Winter of the World is an excellent continuation of his Century trilogy. The characters are all well drawn, the history is solid, and it kept me turning pages throughout. I'm ready for the next one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love love loved it such an amazing series I just wish they was more..I would love to read more....maybe I will read them
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|As a fan of Hitchcock,  I loved the movie.  Anthony Hopkins was excellent as Hitchcock and did great service to his memory.  The genius of Hitchcock as the 'Master of Suspense' was understood as I watched this movie centered around Hitchcocks direction of 'Psycho'.  I recommend also watching HBO's 'The Girl' , a movie concerning Hitchcock s 'The Birds'.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was even more exciting then the first one so sensual and erotic can't wait to read the last one
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this is just a grate app for kids! all thow some of the caritars are creepy!I got my money off it thow!
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I don't know if I caught all of the new things that was added to the movie.  But I am looking forward to watching it again and again until I see all of it.
B004ZNA5JO|2.0|They should never have bothered with this one. Waters was right, by the mid-1980s PF was a spent creative force.
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|Quo Vadis is one of those movies that stays in your mind all your life. I started watching this movie when I was 10 years old and I still watch it two or three times during the year. These type of movies with lots of extras, like they use to make in the 50's are my favorites. Amongst them Ben Hur, The Robe and of course Quo Vadis. The music of Miklos Rozsa is superb!!! A good family movie to watch!!!
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|Great movie and ready to watch in seconds @ home on snow-day (school cancelled - roads impassible).....so easy and quick emergency activity to teach @ home and supplement school activities
B00BJS7104|5.0|Django Unchained is the best movie I have seen so far this year. All the actors and actresses did an amazing job, Jamie Foxx especially. I think Jamie Foxx has a little bit of gangster in him. Keri Washington did a good job as well. There is no doubt in my mind there will be more coming from them. This was a blockbuster hit.
1439190275|5.0|Explained more in depth than their website and I found it very useful on the program. I am very glad I bought this for questions to be explained more to me than I had found before on the atkins site. Good purchase.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love these games they are so worth 99¢<br />I would recommend this for teens or adults<br />It keeps me entertained at work on those slow boring days-<br /> I will be getting another g5 game now
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is such an addicting game that is super fun. I like that the eggs don't get &#34;sick&#34; like this company's pet shop game. I wish it wasn't as hard to find the combination for breeding some of these dragons.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Awesome app! Addicting. I love this app. It is very very very fun. I recommend Mystery Manor to anyone who likes hidden object games. But it more than just finding objects. You have to protect your manor from snatchins to gypsies. From demons to zombie lieutenants. You can do all these things &amp; so much more on Mystery Manor!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|If you like hidden object games, you'll like this game.  The objects you look for are not duplicated, like they are in so many other hidden object games.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|\\"Trouble with the Curve\\" is formulaic, predictable, long, and as outdated as its anti-sabermetric and anti-moneyball message.  (While the baseball argument remains unsettled, \\"Moneyball\\" is a far better film, so that much is clear.)  Beyond that, the movie wastes decent actors like Amy Adams and the legendary Clint Eastwood, who just plays the latest in his recent long line of \\"old curmudgeon\\" roles, and much more lifelessly than his great work in \\"Gran Torino,\\" for example.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I love these people, and I am not ready to let them go. Thank you Colleen for sharing them with me.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very interesting. I like the Giant Demon Monkey. It feels less scary than the multiple normal Demon Monkeys. Excellent game.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I loved this movie and being from Boston I loved it even more. It came before the Acadamy awards and that made it more fun. great movie and a real fun and nerve racking exsperience
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Great game. I haven't played in a while, but when i do, it is great. The words are great choices.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is the best because it lets me view my friends pictures and status.  It keeps me informed about today's news.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is really fun it is cool because you get to feed it pet it train it and you get to clean its stables and you get to pick your own outfit and everything you guys should get it if your a hourse lover or even if your not a real huge fan for hourses I think you will like it
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This app lets me view the whole website without any gimmicks.  It is so convenient and easy to maneuver.  It also lets me view birthdays.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|t.i. came back with another classic ! i've been a fan since trap muzik, own all his albums, and been a supporter every since. if you want some quality hip hop look no further than this album it's definitely worth the money i bought it twice when it came out because it exceeded my expectations.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Love reading this still have a long way to go. My goal is to read the entire collection before they finish the show. Very good read and still haven't put it down.
B007SGM084|5.0|I LOVED the story of Christian and Anastasia!! So many twists, so many turns and so much love, understanding and forgiveness. E. L. James you rock girlfriend! I will happily read any and all of your stories. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Haven't read the whole thing yet bet already looking forward to getting the next book in the series. I recommend it.
B008U0FJF8|4.0|There are a few names that when they pop up in the new release category I have to buy it. Manu Katche is one of those names. His music never seems to stop exciting me with something new. It's always introspective, layered and well-composed in that vein of jazz that simply applies emotion to what could be a jazz soundtrack of life. On his newest release simply titled &#34;Mau Katche&#34; the artist throws in an exciting new wrinkle, the famed Hammond B-3 organ.<br />Here the organ is not used solely for its funk inducing properties as usual, but still provides a tinge of it. Here  provides more of a deeply pastoral bottom while also serving the bass lines. What you end up getting s not s much an in your face bass sound but a sound that becomes bass seasoning.It allows the mood to flow without taking the attention away from the musical intent.  simply sublime,
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|My boyfriend has been reading this one. He is a huge fan of the shown and since its coming to an end he wanted to read all of the books. Better read apparently compared to the show.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Could not put it down!  This was my first Colleen Hoover book and it won't be my last. I really enjoyed this story!!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Works pretty much like a scientific calculator, only with many added features.  Easy to use, comes with a few different themes and pretty straightforward operation. Well worth it.
140191716X|4.0|This is a wonderful book. I actually look forward to reading it each morning! It is my first book by Doreen Virtue, but I'm sure I'll be purchasing more!
B0095P33IW|4.0|Better than I thought it would be. Liked how we found out the origin of Captain America. Loved Stan Lee's cameo appearance.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I can not stand this book. Everyone says its so great, I've even heard a critic say its the &#34;Breakfast Club of this generation&#34;. That's so insulting.<br />Cannot stand the author's depiction of the main character.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this book, but I just can't even bring myself to talk about it at all anymore.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great story and beautifylly done.  I am waiting for season 4 to start . It can's be soon enough for me.  I wish we had great stories like this in the USA instead of the trash we have.
B00942X8PY|4.0|The object of this game is to fill the playing board with certain lengths of each color, maneuvering around obstacles such as blocks and following rules such as required paths.  Using the game's logo as an example, you'd start each of the colored lines at one end, which would have the number 8 in it, and trace around until you used 8 squares.  The black in the logo would represent blocks which cannot be moved or covered.  It is quite similar to [[ASIN:B004SQPI22 InfeCCt]] by Handy Games , though nowhere as visually appealing.  The music, on the other hand, is nice.<br /><br />GOOD:<br />+ Hundreds of Levels<br />+ Pleasurable Music<br />+ Brain Exercise<br />+ All Levels Unlocked<br />+ No Leaderboard<br /><br />BAD:<br />- NO Instructions<br />- Lousy Graphics<br />- Condescending Quips<br />- Annoying Sounds<br />- Ads and IAP for Other Games<br /><br />There are two game modes: Zen Mode and Puzzle mode (in reverse order).  Each offers a slightly different experience in that Zen Mode doesn't have a timer and does not have achievements.  The levels are the same for both modes, and since each mode has hundreds of levels, there is a lot of substance here.<br /><br />In Zen mode, you get to play the game at your pace.  I recommend starting here, because be warned that there are no instructions - not only do you have to figure out the puzzles, you have to figure out how to play.  You do, however, get pithy, if not mystifying quips when you finish levels in Zen Mode.<br /><br />In \\"Puzzle\\" mode, the game is timed.  You can reset the level, but the timer never stops; you can, however, is replay a level once you've finished it.  Apparently, if you finish the level within a predetermined time, you are awarded \\"medals\\" as achievements (meaningless, really), each with a condescending quip:<br />* Gold: Impressive, for you.<br />* Silver: Satisfactory, almost.<br />* Bronze: Our condolences.<br />* None: No Medal.  Whatever.<br /><br />In both modes, you are permitted to choose to play any level you want without having to \\"unlock\\" it.  That's a nice feature.<br /><br />The game continuously adds new challenges, such as blocked paths and paths that must contain a color.  To keep with tradition, it gives no instruction whatsoever about what to do with each new obstacle or rule.<br /><br />The music is actually very nice.  The title pages have a nice, balanced tone and tempo, while the Zen Mode has relaxing music and Puzzle Mode has more energetic offerings. However, I do suggest turning OFF the Sound FX as they are rather distracting and annoying.<br /><br />This game purports to have IN-APP PURCHASING (IAP), which will cost you real money if you, or a child, accidentally chooses to buy something.  At least in this case it looks like the IAP is only for purchasing additional games from within the app rather than paying for useless in-game items or hints/cheats.  Note that the first time you launch this app, you get slammed with an ad for another game with IAP.  Not to mention the \\"More Games\\" button on the main page and even in the settings page.  Really?  The *settings* page??  Jeesh... At least the Quick Start button takes you back to where you left off.  If this had been a paid app (FAOTD today), I'd be unhappy about that.<br /><br />The only permission that is given is for network access, which makes sense because it wants to give you the opportunity to spend money through Amazon's billing service.<br /><br />In summary, it's a decent game, and I'd say it was worth $0.99.  However, the fact that the game doesn't tell you how to play and the visuals are exceedingly boring, I had to remove a star.  I'd have removed another for IAP, but in this case I'll waive that since it is just a gateway to buying their other games at Amazon.se to play any level you want without having to \\"unlock\\" it.

B00BESM14U|5.0|I'm a mom to you 3 year old and rarely get time to watch a movie. This was the first one I got to watch in a while and it was a great movie. You won't be disappointed if you rent or buy it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app. I have never had a problem with it and I love the feature where the alarm gets louder so it doesn't jolt you out of sleep.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is not for people who give up easily. But if you love challenges and replay value, this game is perfect for you. I personally find it entertaining and rewarding to win.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|An excellent evolution of the original addictive game. the new obstacles and modes of transport are fun. I love the surprise of making it to the mines. I like leveling up the powers. Just well made in general.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I could not put this hook down and when I wasn't reading it I thought about it and could not wait to pick it back up again. It had an ending that I was hoping for, yet really did not expect!
B008OJ291W|4.0|I bought it for my wife. She's a 55 year old in a 30 year old body (don't tell her i told you her age). She likes it. Has all the classics (apparently).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />definitely contains something resembling music. I think i heard instruments.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I don't like ELO. I have to hear it in the car when she drives. I think she got it so i wouldn't ask her to drive anywhere anymore.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|By reading some of the reviews I did not know what to expect. It was a great story kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. Great how the whole story reaped up.  Don't listen to the bad reviews. Get the book you will love it

B004JN1CW4|3.0|I had to finish it it because I started it. Don't get me worng there was a lot going on but it was missing a few key elements. I can't put my finger on it but I feel the series was forced, an incomplete thought, not well rounded. A failed mission like the trails.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this app. The graphics are great and never blurry. It's the only app like this, so it's really special. I love it! (:
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great performance by all, especially Denzel. I would recommend this movie. A spectacular movie is one that I would purchase to watch again later. I would not purchase this movie.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|How does Amazon justify than it costs more to electronically transfer an ebook than it costs to print, bind, hold in a warehouse and ship a printed book? We need a \\"Napster\\" for books to bring the book publishing industry to their senses.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|When I first read about this book I thought it might be interesting especially since I live near Sarasota, Florida.  It made me want to buy the sequel before I was even halfway finished. Unfortunately I will have to wait for it to come out.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Couldn't put it down, but<br />didn't want it to end. Great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a good read and hard to put down.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the story.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|My husband likes it so far.  It keeps him occupied when in boring situations.  Would recommend it to those that like this type of game/puzzle.
B005I4JG80|5.0|This book makes so much sense, as I am about to have my first baby.  I feel that this is actually how my American mother raised my brother and me.  Wish more American parents would introduce the simple philosophies in this book.
1599290642|5.0|I  couldnt find this book at any store in my area. Thanks for selling it so cheep all it had was a tiny rip on the jacket and who cares about that with so much great art inside.
B0067LXQAW|3.0|Let's start with saying that I love the Cranberries, but this is probably their weakest album. I have all of their albums including the 2 by Dolores. Unfortunately this one doesn't hold up to the same excellence as their other work.
0761169253|5.0|I got this book because it was required for my class. Great idea. I love this book and will be getting a copy for my sister who is graduating this year as a gift. If you have another copy ill buy it from you.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game!! :D Dont you wanna get scared once in a while? how better is it than to be stalked by someone with no eyes? CREEPY
B003K1EYM6|5.0|So easy to use and the photos transfer to my iPad so I can view them right away. This goes everywhere with my camera and iPad.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|It was a bit much of info and someone far fetched. But she always writes this kind of stories. Somewhat entertaining but too much info.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|I haven't opened the package yet. I'm saving it for a marathong. I love this show so much. Great acting and gripping story lines.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I thought this would be just another teen movie but it was much more in depth than that.  The story line was a little confusing at first but then starts to become clearer.  The cast is amazing.  Emma Watson's American accent was great.
B008VBYN80|4.0|this is a cool game but I think that there should be less things involved with social media but still a good game
0345803485|1.0|The story (if there is a story - i just flipped pages of never ending sex scenes just to check whether story will go somewhere readable!) is total CRAP the lead characters are both mentally damaged and their actions devoid of any logic and the author has the vocabulary of a 10 year old! what bothers me is that something is definitely wrong with our civilization and litereary progress if this is the standard of a novel that sells 40 million copies worldwide! am just hoping atleast half of that 40m consist of idiots like me who got kiiled by curiosity.<br /><br />sorry i spilled bucks for rubbish which am going to trash so that kids wont pick it up accidently from my book shelf and will be embarassed by their mother's taste in books! and pl dont think for a minute i've victorian standards when it comes to sex in literature - i love a well written explicit sex scene but when it is a mere repetition of same stuff in every other page by a horror movie hero and retarded heroine who orgasms every two minutes and the narration is handled by a very limited author, man that's hilaious n pathetic and BORING at the same time!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I enjoyed playing this game. I put a lot of time and unfortunately money in this game and one day it just started all over! And I had just purchased some gems that got deleted as well...grrr! This wasn't the 1st time I had to contact Gameloft to get them to give me my  purchased items. They'll gladly take your money but doesn't always follow through on purchases and you have to jump hoops to get your stuff. Overall, I did like playing this game...but VERY disappointed that my game just deleted and they couldn't fix it or give me my money back!
B0070ZLZ1G|2.0|This book starts out fine, explaining the types of patterns seen in successful children.  The author uses the game of chess to explain a lot of these patterns, but after awhile the book seems to be more about chess than anything else.  I read a little over half the book and have now abandoned it because I just couldn't read anymore about chess without getting bored.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This book held my interest with its Intrigue and style. Its a little different from the other Sanderson books I've read.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Hard to really give my opinion without spoiling. I'll say that it is definitely worth a read if you read the first book and I will certainly read the next. I'm far too invested now to turn back. The imagery was great but it left me with a lot of questions. I'm guessing it was meant to. Poor little Lena has a lot on her mind after what she did in the last one and like any teenager she is a freaking mess. A few new characters join the mix and, of course, complicate things further.... I just realized that it is 3:30am. Darn book just wouldn't let me go!
B005DJGMQE|4.0|This is a well done movie...puts an historical event with an interesting perspective. If you like historical movies especially where Lincoln is concerned I recommend watching this!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the way she ended the whole series. I could not stop readin these books. I want to read them again at some point!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun easy game...The cards automatically play when you touch them..very enjoyable. I spend alot of time with this game...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|From the time I started this book I wanted never to stop! I guess I found out there were things that would make me raise my eyebrows! The more I got into this I wanted to read and understand this man! Why was he like this? Well read all three and you will find it out! Can't be a prude  to read these three books!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Writing continues to be superb, character development continues to grow and the story lines are intriguing.  Sorry to see the<br />loss of Sybil and Matthew......I wonder if what he is going to is as good as what he had?  The Dowager Violet add such wit and<br />authenticity to the plot lines; she is at her best when sparring with Cora's mum and Matthews's mother.<br /><br />Highl7y recommended; waiting for Season 4 with baited breath.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|My son told me about this book. I don't think I would have ever thought about reading it from just the title.<br />It was really a good book. She was so detailed in telling her own experience about it! I believe in having experiences like she had at the hospital. I have read other accounts by Dr's themselves. However I did not know about the web site that checks out the accurate details of them. I am glad THAT WAS DONE AND I KNOW IT IS ALL ACCURATE. I would reconmend this to anyone.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Nice case, works exactly as advertised. Protects my kindle and holds my kindle securely. Bought the black cover for my husband and the red cover for myself, that way we can easily identify one kindle from the other.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was taken by this book when I first started reading it. I guess I had some fantacies myself about some of the things he wanted her to do. I was glued to it every time I would start to read it. But you can't be a closed minded person when you read it.I truly enjoyed the mystery of them and the way they were written. Being a married lady I am glad it was a woman that wrote them!
1616550414|5.0|Ce livre est tout simplement parfait! Ce n'est pas juste l'histoire d'Hyrule, mais aussi un Art Book de Skyward Sword et il y a même un OS (manga) à la fin. Il est de très bonne qualité et a presque 300 pages.
1401924751|3.0|I was really looking forward to these cards. When they arrived I found they are to big to schuffle properly. I have given them to someone with larger hands and they can not do it either! I am disappointed but will use them and use a way of mixing them up by lying them face down and mixing them with both hands.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent read wish there was more of the trilogy, couldnt put books down and found myself finding time to read them as much as I could. Definately recomend if u like to read steamy read buy them and enjoy!!!!
1401922732|3.0|I love the artwork but the cards are to large to mix them correctly.They would have been perfect if the size was one inch smaller.But I guess all in all they are still useable!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The book was a quick and easy read. It was cute, funny, and sexy. Perfect for a lazy afternoon read. (:
B00942X8PY|5.0|This game takes a bit to figure out. The symbles are basically self explanatory tho. Enjoyable game that kept me interested right from the beginning.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This item is great I bought it for my 10 year old she is so grateful and enjoys it a lot her sister wants to play it now so now I'm going to buy her one.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This is a fun game.The fast little penguin makes sweet noises as he runs.The things that show up along the way is surprising! A very fast-paced and chalenging game.
0062068415|5.0|Lehane shines in this one by creating an environment in which two federal agents try to get to the bottom of the puzzle of an island that houses an insane asylum. One of the agents soon finds out that reality may not be what it seems. This reminded me of In the Mouth of Madness, Jacob's Ladder, and Shawshank Redemption. Be careful of reading reviews with spoilers. Highly recommended.
B009O2XY12|1.0|This game is removed from my caresoul. I was totaly bored with it.It is not challenging enough for my taste in games!
B003L7DK74|5.0|Quirky. Offbeat. Deadpan. Brilliant. All these adjectives and more apply to this relatively short-lived gem about a pair of New Zealand musicians trying to make it in the U.S. with the help of their manager, who also is a deputy cultural attache with the New Zealand consulate. New Zealand humor seems to be a rougher version of British humor, and it works an absolute treat. The roundabout plots intersect with a usual pair of mock music videos in each half-hour episode, making for comedy that at times reaches for the metaphysical. Highly recommended, if you like yours with a twist....
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This has been one of the better series of its genre in a long time.  It's well written and acted, and keeps your interest at all times.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is an amazing series.  I am going to watch Seasons 1-3 over and over until Season 4 is available.
B00008WT5M|5.0|Great music from one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Great selection of songs on this CD, rockin
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I thought this was pretty bland.  Groban has a great voice, but the songs were not remarkable.  Maybe I need time to have them grow on me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. very interactive.  a lot to do many horses and different features.  I wish there were more apps like this one - its an experience.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|Maybe one has to be in to this whole slender man thing, but this game is Boring with a capital B.  I love survival horror, not sure what this is, but it aint SH.  It got a second star for excellent controls and nice 3D graphics.
B000JMKNVK|4.0|Like Gone Baby Gone, Prayers for Rain is an excellent mystery, it has you guessing who the villain is all. the way through. Highly recommend this Kenzie/Gennaro installment.
B0084AYLK8|4.0|There is a reason this is a classic, it's a good read.Interesting insight into the historic treatment of women in literature.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome cuz I love to play for hours a long time for a year I really like subway run
B008VO3PA4|5.0|I really want to read this book...however I have a Kindle Keyboard and it will only download to the more expensive Kindles. Wow--That's about as bad as it gets.<br />OK I just finished reading my hard copy book --I was baadd and gave a less than favorable review because I wanted it downloaded to my kindle but my kindle is too old. So I am eating crow --This was the cutest, funny book and I understood exactly what the Author meant in the poems. I especially laughed hard at the \\"I am paranoid\\" one. I loved this book and so stopped whining about the Kindle deal. I mean how hard is it to click \\"order?\\" and the book arrives in a couple days. My apologies to the Author and readers of reviews.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|After watching Jennifer Lawrence win the Oscar, and Bradley Cooper dance on Ellen De Generes, I became intrigued, and thought carefully about whether I wanted to read this book or see the movie first. Reading was definitely the right choice--kudos for a simply told tale, for an uncanny ability to portray human kindness and love along with our human frailties. This not literature, but a good story! Thank you.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|This was what we decided to watch as a family one night and it was really good. I was skeptical by watching the preview, but I thought it was really good, and funny.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|We haven't enjoyed a movie so much in a long time.  The characters were played to perfection - no matter if they had a bit part or were in the whole movie.  It was one of those movies where you do NOT want it to end.  The young actors (children) were believable and absolutely great!  The adult actors were equally great and the story was just so endearing.  Wish the Academy Awards would have acknowledged the cast, the director and the writer with the little statuettes!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I changed it to two columns which made it easier to read.  I wish I would have downloaded it to my Ipad rather than to the laptop
B004UJCYYW|4.0|I read this book in french as a child, and felt like reading it again. A wonderful and deep story that touches human hearts.
B00A8ZZ570|5.0|I recently had the pleasure of seeing and hearing this trio of world-class improvisers just a few weeks after acquring this CD, and the recording accurately captures the intensity and extraordinary mastery of these three, all of whom I've seen live with other bands and have heard on previous CDs.  This recording should be in the collection of anyone who admires any of these three killer players, and if you admire all three, get this CD today.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I'm not quite as captivated as I was with Seasons 1 and 2, but it's beautifully portrayed as a costume drama.  I like it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's so fun and I agree it is relaxing! I love this game because it's exiting and you might be exited when a big coin falls and knocks off all the other little coins!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This plan was so complex, and detailed, I can't believe it would have been approved by the president.  Did it really happen as<br />the movie states?  Just looking in the face of a middle eastern person frightens me at times.  They seem so impulsive with the<br />killing instinct, and disregard for human life.  I would be terrified to even be a guest in their countries.  We think that we regard<br />our freedom so highly, but these people think nothing of GIVING THEIR OWN LIVES for their country.  When you meet up with<br />someone like that, the odds are in their favor.....they consider it an honor to KILL themselves for their God.....when our God wants<br />us to respect his creation and the lives of all others as well,.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|except this movie.  Got to be the worst acting I have seen in a long time.  70's scenes were cool, but the future scenes and the language they speek is just rediculous True True!  I am a lover of sci-fi, but this one is two thumbs down for me.  Run Forest Run!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was recommended this book by a friend and it did not disappoint.  Extremely well written.  It surprised me many, many times with unforeseen twists and turns.  Highly recommended.  Sure hope this story continues.  Haven't checked yet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are very beautiful! It's a very fun game! I love how you can earn gems so easily, like when you level up, unlike games like TopGirl where you have to buy gems. Add Me, I'm CottonCandi.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|My sister is a huge Game of Thrones nut, and she asked me specifically for the first season on DVD for her birthday. However, she didn't know I was buying her the discontinued version, and that made her entire week!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book. Way better than the movie. It was like you were living the games. Can't wait to start the second book!!
0062068415|4.0|I didn't buy this book for myself. I personally didn't like the movie, it was very boring, so I figured that this book would be just as boring, except LONGER, and more drawn out. BUT, I bought it for my girlfriend and she read it in four days. She said that it was a great book, and that she enjoyed it alot.<br />So she told me to give it 4 Stars.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|The update apparently has been broken for well over a month.  Also, Google Play version is up to 7.0 and Amazon is at 6.8... If we could move off 6.6
B002ZG997M|5.0|Denzel Washington is amazingly good in this movie. I Have seen this about a dozen times, but never owned it. I finally got myself a nice blu ray player with wifi. I checked out the special features for this, and it seemed worth it for only $13.<br />The story is good, the acting is good, and the over all movie is great. I Loved the ending of the movie too.<br />But I exceptionally love the Special Features on this blu ray. The picture-in-picture is amazing, and informative. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a good movie.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|Works very well, could have been a cable to minimize the connection points. But does what it's supposed to do without any problems.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It's exactly like the computer version. I've played a couple sender man games before, but this is the best by FAR.
B003ASLJRW|5.0|Good Clint western.  Not his best, but certainly in the top five.  This Blu-ray print is OK, but seems like they could have done a better job with an even cleaner transfer if they wanted.
B000JQUHLM|3.0|What an annoyingly irritating girl Pollyanna is.  I loved this book as a child but that was a long time ago.  However it was interesting to read again.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Not just historically inaccurate. This picture is simplistic and almost cartoonish. It diminishes both the Canadians and the hostages. Proof that the Ocsars are irrelevant.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|Fun show for fans of science fiction and Steven King.  Although not written by him, it's loosely based on his concepts.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I truthfully knew nothing about this story when I bought it.  If I heard about the subject matter prior I would have missed a beautiful story.  I have lost my son to suicide....I always avoid reading anything that involves suicide - I just can't handle it.  Colleen Hoover has written an amazing story.  The emotions  that Holden expressed about his sister were spot on.... I am floored how Ms. Hoover took such tragically broken individuals into a touching story of strength and love.  Hopeless is a must read!
0470876417|5.0|Very creative and a great way to examine business models whether you're looking at an established company or considering buidling your own, this book provides some excellent tools.
0062082353|5.0|In his war memoir, American Sniper, Chris Kyle is always apologetically frank, making a rewarding experience to readers who wish to gain insight into the full spectrum of warfare the author experienced. From near death experiences, losing close friends and team mates, and coming to terms with his tense home life, American Sniper does not glorify war - it does just the opposite, making an important addition to the emerging Iraq-Afghanistan War canon. Rest in peace, Chris Kyle, I forever thank you for your service and the mark you left on me.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Nassim Taleb is one of the brightest individuals of our day, and very likely, the last several centuries. For sheer intelligence there may be some that are brighter, but Taleb trumps them with common sense and the ability to sift through a myriad of intellectual musings and identify real world application. These methods may not always be pleasant, but they make us stronger as we go through them; much like an athlete trains to gain strength and stamina. The intelligentsia, those who are at the pinnacle of a fragile system, no doubt look on Taleb with disdain. No matter how politically incorrect, he is willing to debunk popular thinking whether in government, economics, medicine, business, or journalism—and not with right-wing rhetoric. Wiling to debunk? No, he expresses a moral obligation to do so.<br /><br />Taleb is able to articulate difficult concepts. He is, nevertheless, sometimes difficult to understand. This is, in part, because many of his points are expressed in negative terms—like negative convexity, or in double negatives—like Not Doing Nothing. It is also because the concepts are contrary to popular but fragile thinking. This book requires close consideration and deep reflection. I will never see the world as before I read it. And, I must read it again; it is too deep for a single pass.
B004QL7K8E|2.0|No really??  Maybe I'm getting old, but this was about, just, an out-of-control party with zero redeeeming value.  Just verging on anarchy and no respect for their neighbourhood.  I felt bad for the Kub family, I felt bad for their neighbours.  Put yourself in the kid's dad's shoes...you would NOT want to find your new Benz in the bottom of your swimming pool.  Now, I LOVE classic party movies and 80s teen movies like &#34;Weird Science&#34; and &#34;Bachelor Party&#34; and &#34;16 Candles&#34;...and the &#34;American Pie&#34; movies are all great...&#34;Road Trip&#34; and the 2 &#34;Hangover&#34; movies.<br /><br />But &#34;Project X&#34;...nowhere close.<br /><br />The kids are forgettable and &#34;Costa&#34; is just an annoying nerd jerk who was just concerned about his own &#34;getting some&#34; and doesn't care if his pals get into trouble or not as a result of his own selfish needs, or his birthday boy friend's house gets torched...he even weasels out of charges placed on him with an expensive lawyer...you would NOT want to have a friend like him in high school, college, or life in general...I also feel bad for the dog Milo, and his dad.<br /><br />There is no redeeming value at all, no happy ending, it's not even really funny...the best parts are the directorial style, and &#34;T-Rick&#34; was an interesting scary character...but that's it...
B004XQYBA2|4.0|Plenty of puzzles and lots of variants with lots of difficulty ranges. I like Andoku better though as it has better features
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Even though you know historically how it must end, it keeps you drawn to the edge of your seat. Hoping just maybe, everything works out and the world around you changes for the better. Unfortunately, all King fans know, everything seves the tower. Amazing book!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|love being able to turn this on and fall asleep with the sounds of a camp fire and rain. worth the price easy and tell my friends about this
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book is a frank look at the Iraq war through the eyes of one who fought it.  No glory stories just the war as it happened for him.<br />A must read for anyone looking into the reality of war.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I just said it &#34;Addicted&#34; and it seems 15 more words are required to submit a review so here they are.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|This game was pointless. I found nothing scary about it. All you do is wander around finding a few notes and when your screen gets fuzzy you walk the other way.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I downloaded this program again to get back to an earlier version as the current version was giving me fits.  Each time I launched it would prompt me that I had upgraded and needed to convert my offline Bibles.  I would get a conversion complete message, but the next time I launched the program, same thing all over again.  I've been in contact with tech support, but they're convinced it isn't the program, although I have complied with every directive, up to and including uninstalls and reinstalls.  So 3 stars, I like the program, but am annoyed that I can't run the latest version (with some definite enhancements) without a hassle.  For those interested, I'm running the app on a Nexus 7 with Jellybean 4.2.2.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|It brought Jack Nicholson into stardom. I was a teenager at the time when it came to theaters and liked it. Now, years later, I was able to watch it this time in the comfort of my home streamed in HD from Amazon. A great acting job by Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson. The storyline is also great, it keeps you guessing the first time you watch it.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|The game seems really neat.  I am looking foward to playing full version. The graphics are good, and the story line seems interesting
B005LAII8A|5.0|WE WATCHED THIS THE OTHER EVENING AND REALLY DID ENJOY IT...A BIT CONFUSING IN THE BEGINNING BUT I THINK WE WILL BE WATCHING IT SEVERAL MORE TIMES...YA CANT BET ANYTHING THAT BRUCE WILLIS PLAYS IN.THE DVD WAS IN GREAT CONDITION!!!<br /><br />THANK YOU,<br />JACQUELINE CHAVEZ
B005COO1X6|2.0|I thought it would be longer for $2.99. It's a well written short story but not well priced. Would recommend if you don't really care about prices.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Can't wait for season 3 on DVD blue ray. I will have read the books in the mean time. Thanks
B009IEXKXI|5.0|You know that person who you cannot discuss any form of entertainment with because they nitpick every implausibility to death?  This is the book for them.  A series of unfortunate events are met with technical and thought out solutions.  Truthfully I thought this detail detracted a bit from the amazing storytelling, but it was done with such passion and effort there's no way I'm willing to penalize this  for it... Especially when I know how much the oscar the grouches of the world will adore this book for it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This series is so cleverly written and has twists and turns that are shocking.  You need to see the first season or you won't know what's going on.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|I had all episodes recorded except the first one.  I am glad I bought the pilot, I would have been lost without seeing it.
1400069289|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting.I like the fact that the author isn't a psychologist but a writer/researcher, which in my opinion, gave it more credibility. It was very thoughtful in that it caused me to stop and think about what I do on a regular basis and figure out why I do it and most important, how to stop doing it. The author also explained how to identify and change a habit, which I thought was very helpful. Lets face it we are all creatures of habit to some extent; at least after reading this book, I realize that I don't have to be a slave to that habit and the option to change is available with surprisingly very little work.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|Allman Brothers Band Live in New York City at WPLJ... try listening to WPLJ now, you'll fall asleep.<br /><br />The original lineup with no over-dubs, incredible! Other than seeing the Bros.live over the years, I have not heard a recording where you actually hear Gregg playing the Hammond and where his part fits into the overall sound of the group other than starting a number off.<br /><br />Gregg Allman is one the great songwriters, bar none, and his contribution to American and world music is set in stone.<br /><br />Listening to Brother Duane give a eulogy to King Curtis who had been recently murdered near his Harlem home is chilling considering what was to come two months later.<br /><br />Great Job! by all involved in getting this historical document released. Strong Buy!<br /><br />It's been far too long since we have heard Richard Betts playing with the band.<br />C'mon, original band members... whatever it is, put it aside and get back out there with new songs and all.<br />The band and fans alike live in the same punchbowl that seems to be draining rather quickly and Rock and Roll is The elixir and not many have mashed it up like ABB.<br /><br />Again, Strong Buy before the price goes up or there ain't none left.
B009PQ5Y4M|5.0|Excellent follow up story to the Alien series.<br />Great picture and sound clarity.<br />&#34;But who made them?&#34;<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, you need to.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was very well written.  It took a young girl with a very trouble past and troubled mind to see the beauty in flowers and finally trusting others.<br />It was a book that kept me entertained to the end and not wanting it to end.
B003L16FAE|5.0|Excellent clarity of picture and sound.<br />This is a very well constructed story.<br />I have seen the film at least 20 times (OK, maybe 40 times). I watched this new copy and enjoyed it all over again.<br />My only negative comment is one the two crude jokes told about the girlfriend.<br />This and the original Alien are two of my favorite story lines.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh does it again. Another beautiful CD with some famous names as co-composers. There's a song for everyone's taste on this cd. Really happy I bought it!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case is the worst case I have ever used , it vibrates your voice to the point you or the other person on the other end of the call can't understand you !!!! Don't waste your money
B004SIPA4G|5.0|Awesome blu ray! The video is pristine. Great movie too. Package arrived promptly with no issues. Great buy! I highly recomend.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|LOVE IT!<br /><br />It's Titanic on Blu-ray with lots of special features... need I say more? Well I have to bc it's making me- it'S FREAKING FANTASTIC!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice app and its free. Kindle should have this as pre-installed app. So everyone knows about it, I use it just about every day.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Heritage, the most progressive album Mikael Åkerfeldt and company is a musical journey, Mikael definitely a true master of music
B004WR125O|4.0|I have an Onkyo Digital Receiver....this simply plugs in and gives the receiver access to my internet.  I needed to update the Onkyo firmware before I got this to work, but I am now streaming Pandora from the internet in my office.  Love the connected world!
B005974CNA|5.0|When I heard that Mike Portnoy and Dream Theater was not thought, &#34;oh my god never sound the same&#34; but I think I'm wrong in my personal opinion I would say &#34;A Dramatic Turn of Events&#34; is among the top 3 album of Dream Theater and the best of 2011
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I am not sure who likes this game more between my boys and my husband.  This is definitely a game for all ages.  Brings back the days of the original Sega
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just love Downton Abbey. The characters spring to life and begin to feel 'real'. Just cannot wait for the next season.
B005HSL626|3.0|It is a pretty good game, but doesn't hold interest for long.  My boys play it for a few minutes at a time, but not one of their favorites.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire movie.  Ben's pretty easy on the eyes too;-)  My husband and I both enjoyed the movie, and we often have a hard time agreeing on what to watch.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I don't like it at all...I could not even open this game.  I would like it taken off my kindl fire account...Thak You.
1936891026|3.0|The first two parts of this book are, by far, the best thing about it.  It's not terribly organized and I found myself more interested in the author's early life(which he mentions periodically) than I was in the current passage.  Part 2 of the book is the best, focusing on what a professional does versus what an amateur does.  The short version is, show up everyday to your art/work as if it were a job.  Treat your creative outlet as a job.  It takes work, so just get on with it.  The book could've organized the 'how' of this subject a bit better.<br /><br />The last part of the book dives into some philosophy/psychology/religion that I found to be, as another reviewer noted, \\"a bunch of drivel\\".  I'd have to agree.  The notion that creativity comes from some invisible force such as a muse or an angel seems terrible to me.  The book leaves you wanting more, which I suppose is good.  But the last part also spoiled the entire book for me because it made me think the author was just some burned out hack writer who finally got his life together and thanks God for it.  I could've done without part 3.
B004A8EI9M|1.0|Horribly boring.  The acting was the only thing that was half decent, but even it was mediocre.  The story line was non-existent (just another rehash of the same zombie apocalypse nonsense that was interesting the first time you saw it but painful the thousandths time.  Don't waste your time and don't believe the hype.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am a gamer and spend hours each week playing.  I like this game, for a free game it is first-rate.  The one thing that could be improved on is for the game not to give you unplayable boards and tell you &#34;No More Move&#34; and then you have to wait while the software looks for and presents a new board, which may also be unworkable.  This cuts the flow of the game, and is the only drawback to playing.  If you can put up with that, it's buckets of fun.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I have not yet read the book...I actually read The Last Olympian first then back tracked a bit to the The Titan's Curse and the The Battle of the Labyrinth...I have since read The Lost Hero, The Son of Neptune, and The Mark of Athena.<br /><br />Even though the movie I don't think, based on oddities in the other books, follows the book verbatim, I still think the movie script was well written and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it again and again.  I will say though that you should spend some time and read the books...its worth your time.
B004I744AS|5.0|I was very surprised to see the cover page of this app.  It gives your horoscope, this day in history, today's birthday, your weather, one current news story, a quote of the day, two games and more.  And the very top line, where you are going to type the word you need, is obvious and not hidden under some self-promoting banner.  Check it out!
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked it. I think it greatly resembled 50 shades although it moves a bit faster leaving out a lot of details. And I find the female character compelling but not as easy to relate to. I think it would have been perfect had I not previously read 50 shades
B004NELBPC|2.0|I loved this app until the update, only works 1/3 of the time on my android. No point in having now since I have to go to the browser to actually see it.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Reading Jaycee's story of survival is so moving and inspirational. She shows such resilience and fight for freedom. I recommend this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Keeps me on time and I love the snooze option. There is no sleeping through this alarm. it can be heard 3 rooms away.
0425263908|5.0|This book is one of the best books i've ever read. I don't even read, actually hate to read. I read the 50 shades trilogy and loved it then had to have more. I personally like this book better, and have just started reading the second book Reflected in you and already loving it too!! RECOMENDED BY A NON-READER ME!!
B002R26I78|4.0|There were a few holes in the story, yet it was moving.  I do like Javier Bardem.  I wondered why certain things were presented and not explained.
0920668372|5.0|This book say it all about life and how it works. Great for all ages. Or it maybe one that really pulls on the heart strings of adults. All I do know is this is must have book.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|It was typical Clint Eastwood.  Grouchy and short on words.  Love him.  It was a good heartwarming movie.  Good movie for baseball fans.
B00005OAES|5.0|I have been on a recent quest to try and obtain the vinyl records that I had grown up with. Bob Dylan was one whose records I played until they were beyond listenable. New vinyl pressing are very expensive now, and in some instances  don't sound as good as the originals.<br /><br />However, this in not the case with this mono pressing. It sounds as good if not better than the original. I don't know if all the reissues in this series sound this good, but I can attest to this one. I am interested in the &#34;Bringing it All Back Home&#34; to hear if it sounds this good.<br /><br /> Used vinyl is a &#34;crap shoot&#34; and very expensive for anything that was valuable in good condition. If I am going to buy it, it better sound good. Unfortunately, vinyl was originally produce on vintage analog equipment. It has become sort of a lost art with the advances of digital technology.<br /><br />For those who are Bob Dylan fans and looking to enhance their vinyl collection. I highly recommend this pressing.
B001RCUL5Y|5.0|Just as described. Great family movie to share some popcorn and spend time together. Great movie for anyone who has lost their imagination over the years.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is a lot of fun. I got it for myself and three Grandkids to do together and we all love it. My only complaint are the pop up adds. I would prefer to have the option of buying the app so that I don't have to worry about the kids.
B000FC1PNE|2.0|I love her other books from the Bridgerton family novels but this one is really kind of boring. I was still interested enough to read most of it but could not bear to finish.
B000GCFX36|4.0|I thought the story was mindless & insipid at first, but compelling enough to continue & I'm so glad I did because it got better & better!!  It was very insightful and enjoyable!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Nothing else needs to be said.  I've said all that has to be said.  The book is absolutely on fire.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw bits of a couple shows, looked like we would like it. I bought it and then,  Serenity. My mom loves Castle with Nathan Fillion, they watched it too. We liked  them both. Glad we got them and I think we payed a good price for both.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I will be a blaspheme to say I love this game even more than all the Big Fish games I have enjoyed. For me it's the best of the Alawar games as well.<br />Even though I had played the game once a couple months ago, the replay made me jump more than once.  The graphics are excellent but the big deals in this game are the cut scenes.  They are crazy good.  Quick, entertaining,nbest graphics anywhere and they contribute greatly to the story.<br /><br />I would love to have more games of this caliber on a regular basis.  So well worth the money.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|The movie is a spellbinding homage to the power of music to lead to change in each of us, and how Rodriguez, who was a virtual unknown in the US, was the voice of the South African counter culture. Through it all, his love for his family, the music and his continued humility make Rodriguez seem to be what this country is longing for. Not to mention the music, which stands up against anything I've ever listened to, a nice mix between James Taylor, Bill Withers, and Neil Diamond
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat. Finally, a good ending.  Tense at times but delivered well and good.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|Free enterprise at its best. This story is the first great triumph of the new century, and the movie tells it well. One criticism: the sound is poor. There's a great deal of sotto voce stuff here, and without crackerjack hearing its' too easy to miss critically important conversation.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This  is app is addicting! But that is because when you are so close to getting your high score you turn and everything freezes and glitches !
0425263908|5.0|The book arrived very quick and as exactly described.  I started reading it immediately and almost couldn't put it down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the bomb it so totally awesome it is a 5 star game it is just awesome now I can own at least one horse for free
B003O86FMW|4.0|Looking forward to the second movie this fall- no question Jennifer will make Katnissa legend for girls of all ages
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft! i recommend it highly. I have made many things on creative and it is highly addictive and i think everybody who enjoys fighting monsters and building stuff shoulld get it
B00846F1YW|5.0|its so addicting and seriously the best game ever!!! I can play all day!!!! I highly recommend to you to play this game I love it so much!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am addicted to this game I just love it. Sometimes it moves slow but other then that no problems.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|Love this group... they just keep getting better and better over the years.  Can't wait till the next album... even better the next REMIX album!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much have fun this game is so fun even my one<br />Year old sister love this game so mnch so i dont have no same and you dont<br />need have bo same so just play it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't believe it!! It is fascinating! The way Ana thinks, her expressions, and the way she acts is a typical female behavior. I just can't keep my eyes away from this  book. Also, I'm in love of Christian Grey, Lol !!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this! It's very much like the Mario games and its good for  the mind because while you play your mind is actually thinking it's not a game where you just do whatever you fingers want to
B0086700CM|5.0|It's the best game I have ever played in a long time. It was amazing. It's perfect for kids and adults!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Things work fine, some I use more than others.  The phonograph needle did not fit my system but worked on my mother's.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I ordered this movie 'New' but it came used.<br />It's not really a big deal because the movie still played perfectly.<br /><br />Otherwise the movie is great.<br />I do recommend it.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Subtle surrealism and great choice of archaic context creates a realistic fantasy world. The characters are contrasted well in their environments.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is totally awesome. You will enjoy real life like adventures while playing. I rate this game 5 stars.lo
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Update still doesn't work. There is no excuse for the amount of time this has been broken. Don't buy it until something is done.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This set of music is a delight to listen too. It's great for serious Moody Blues addicts (like me) and shows the absolute mastery of music that Justin has been gifted with. Three of the songs have Nashville Bluegrass roots and are a huge smile in my heart. The Redux of &#34;I know you're out there Somewhere&#34; shows the genius of the lead singer and songwriter of the beloved Moodys. This is like NOTHING I expected but after contemplation I laughed to myself realizing that like EVERYTHING the Moodys have ever done, It's magical. Can anyone believe the Moody Blues are NOT in Rock and Roll Hall of fame?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard about this series, watched the first season and now I'm hooked!!! Love the characters and the story line.  The settings are beautiful and the period of time is so different from some of the &#34;sit coms&#34; now being shown.  Great series.  Keep it coming!!!  Unfortunately I have to wait until it either becomes free lending at my library or free from Amizon prime.  I can be patient though and look forward to the next viewing season.
B000IZA9NK|3.0|If you get into the spirit of this movie, it can be a lot of fun. It is the ultimate 1950s sci-fi fantasy told in a wild and breathtaking style that lets it all go. But if you are not in the right mood, it could be a unfathomable boor.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This was Bond, but an older, less brash Bond. Still entirely competent and irrestible to women, he is also facing a new generation, a new world where gimmicky cars may not be the solution to everything.<br /><br />It was interesting to see the relationship with M develop amd interesting to see a more human Bond, facing mortality and age discrimination, yet still able to prevail in the cool and sophisticated style we expect from the Bond character. A fun movie.
009193768X|5.0|Most of the books I've read about tea have been window dressing--all fuzzy pictures and romance.  As a tea lover with a brain, I want substance, facts, and usable recipes.  This little book delivers all of the above, along with great photos, fun reproductions of historical ads, and the odd line of quirky British humor.  It makes no pretense to be a scholarly tome, but it's got substance, personality, and charm.  The recipes are practical for the home cook, and offer a range that goes beyond the obvious.  The obvious are here too (scones, cucumber sandwiches, et al), but there are also recipes such as Stilton and Fig Tart, and Gingerbread with Prunes and Ale.  I've tried several so far, and the results were excellent.  This book would make a wonderful gift for anyone who loves tea.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Entertaining, hours of fun. Lots of different things to do. G5 has some good games. I try to get them on sale whenever possible. The new games are on sale for the first couple of days. And then say goodbye to hours ;)
B008KYOCA2|2.0|This calendar will not perform on the Kindle Fire HD - don't waste your time downloading.  Especially bothersome is when you create a new task, the item will not hide after you enter all info -- just freezes your screen.
B008JFUNAU|4.0|Four stars might be a stretch, but there were enough memorable characters and magical moments to just barely save the day. Then again it's pretty sad when the two best characters are a CGI china doll and a talking monkey in a suit. I loved both of them.<br /><br />James Franco as Oz shines and fails from scene to scene. Mila Kunis as one of the three witches can't seem to shake her That 70's Show/Family Guy voice and it get really annoying, especially towards the end. The other two witches played by Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz thankfully fare much better.<br /><br />The IMAX 3-D is done really well and is worth the extra money, though the film is way too CGI heavy. Beautiful, but hollow. I did like how the first 20 minutes was in 1:33:1 screen ratio and black and white. It gave the opening the right feel.<br /><br />Danny Elfman usually works his musical magic with Tim Burton and often sounds like a broken record, but his Oz score fits the tone and visuals. Some of the pieces are quite beautiful.<br /><br />As pure entertainment, I had a good time. Miles from the 1939 classic, but a trip to Oz is worth your time.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I was scared when I read the reveiws I was in five secs. of the game then I saw him he just stood there I closed the app cause I got scared if u play this game here me now. don't look behind u.  don't go in the woods.  and if u see him just run and do not look back.  I'm serious he will get u if u look back.  u must have nerves of steel to play this game.  if u here loud music that means he is very close behind u.  don't challenge slendy.  or its ur nightmares and funerals
B004INNRFK|5.0|Except if you were at the concert - David Foster is incredible and what a group of entertainers. I want to go to the next concert wherever it is held.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Warning! Super addictive but I absolutely love this game it is fun and challenging and makes for a good time.
1439127727|4.0|Well researched and organization is good. Unmasks both presidents and predecessors.They put on their pants one leg at a time like the rest of us. Most interesting take away - once out of office,exes are interested in protecting the integrity of the office, not the man.As one might expect, Nixon is pilloried, bt so is LBJ<br />In general, there is reasonable balance in treatment of Democrats and Republicans, although the authors, both NYT reporters, seem to rely heavily on data from the newspaper's files.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great storyline and very well acted. With each episode, couldn't wait to watch the next one.  Looking forward to season 4.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I felt the story was well written and well executed. 343 is clearly setting up a series, and the film provided a deeper look into the Halo universe. I have been an avid fan of the game for over 10 years, and have read most of the books available, this film fit well into the existing story line.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I purchased this because of the the 20th Anniversary of the film and also its release onto Blu-Ray. Seeing this beautifully crafted film about one of the darkest moment's of the world's history is so humbly awe-inspiring. This is Steven Spielberg at his absolute finest, and now it is an honor to see it with such clarity.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Both my 6 year old daughter and I enjoy playing this game. Fun addition to diner dash.<br />Priced well.99cents was a great price
B005V4ZEY2|5.0|MUST HAVE APPLICATION<br /><br />If you have an expensive or important android device this application is simply a must have.<br /><br />Among it's MANY attractive features it also is \\"hidden\\" if you choose to do so. I consider my self a power user on my phone and other than having a specific passcode it is incredibly difficult to even notice this application is running, even with applications like Cleaner and task killers.<br /><br />The features advertised all work exactly as stated- this application will locate your device with GPS functionality, Take pictures without any indication (Flash, screen changing)<br /><br />If you value your android device GET THIS APP IMMEDIATELY. This app can and very will likely mean the difference between recovering a lost or stolen device or taking a $500 hit on a new phone.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Liked the movie a lot. Watched it twice. My 13 year old daughter was maybe going to watch it, but I don't think she would have liked it. Powerful movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! Easy to use, multi function calculator with large buttons....what's not to love? It turns my whole kindle fire into  calculator!
B0095P33IW|5.0|Chris Evans does a terrific job as scrappy, honorable & intelligent Steve Rogers. Tommy Lee Jones as a crusty skeptical general and  Stanley Tucci as the doctor who gives Rogers superpowers do a terrific job in supporting roles. Hugo Weaving plays the Red Skull as Rogers' nemesis. The story and action sequences are well done. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
1451695195|5.0|This author, a man of science can change your very soul! I highly recommend this book to everyone! Very well presented. This story goes way beyond religion. It is for all.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|All in all this book is a pretty good one! If you don't like foul language then this one probably isn't for you, the man in this book is military and you can tell. This book is an autobiography of the man that was killed not long ago, he was and still is in my opinion an American Hero!! The book has Chris's point of view and his wife's which makes it that much more interesting.
