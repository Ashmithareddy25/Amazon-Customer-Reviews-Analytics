159463176X|4.0|More wandering than Hossein's other novels, the MOUNTAINS ECHOED<br />is convoluted regarding family lines and connections.  The language<br />isn't as lyrical, rather bouncing off sharp edges.  I liked it, but I did not<br />feel it was as satisfying as his past literary works.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The complete collection at a great price for everyone who likes the Alien series of movies - definitely worth it!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Pretty disappointed with this one. Found if hard to keep up with it...couldn't hold my attention. Nothing really exciting about it until 80%. Hope the next one's a whole lot better!
B00DU74U74|4.0|I was surprised that I enjoyed this movie. I'm not into love stories, but the sci-fi aspect is what interested me. It's not like other science fiction action movies. It has a softer side. The main characters are interesting because they are good people at heart, living in a messed up world. It's all about finding peace and getting along. Very nice concept.
B001AQR3JY|4.0|great movie i will buy more at some time, in the future for my grandson who just loves it thanks
B0014Z4OL6|3.0|I chose this rating because there was a scratch on the DVD, near the end, of the movie,  which was very aggravating.  I tried cleaning the disk, with no luck.  Don't think I'll try another used DVD......
B00849F82E|5.0|The subject line says all that can be said when a book is so brilliant it speaks to the common man.
B006YMLE7G|5.0|I've never been so stoked after watching an anime in a long time! Watching it with surround sound was awesome!
0393325172|5.0|I am 83 years old. Since 1993, when I first heard about this series, I have re-read the series 43 times. I'm on the 44th time now. Patrick O'Brian has no equal.<br /><br />Jack K. Jaynes
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I watched Season 1 on HBO and read the book later.  I don't know which order is better, but the characters in the book are much better in terms of depth.  I really didn't like the character Sansa in the movie, but in the book, she does what she does out of self-preservation, not naivety.  This is an excellent read!
B001EN71CW|1.0|This was one of the worst TV series I have seen yet. The sets were crude and the dialog meaningless. It was simply a display of violent behavior with no redeeming qualities.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|GREAT FUN for everyone. The kids love playing and watching my wife and I play. It is really great to have a game we can all play and enjoy watching be played together
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a Great game!! More levels please!! Nice to play a game that challenges your brain instead of being mindless.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Good plot. Kept me interested until the end. Twist at the end that I didn't see coming. Would recommend anyone to watch.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I cant help but want yo ser more. So many twists and turns. Keeps you on edge of your  seat.
B007HLIUN4|3.0|the discussions on the theory of inclusive and extractive political and economic institutions become repetitive over the course of the book. the historical discussions and country analysis are interesting. overall, am glad I purchased the book as it gave me a different perspective on how nations developed.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I'm not sure if there was a recent update but it started crashing every time I tried opening it two weeks ago. That's unfortunate because I was really pleased with the app up until then.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Huge fan of Mumford & Sons and absolutely love this album. Cannot wait to see them this fall when they come to Houston. Highly recommend it!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Gotta love Bruce Willis and all the gang. They make great group of actors. This is a action movie & yet funny!
1118109791|5.0|This has many questions that can help you prep for this difficult exam. I'd recommend as it gives you a lot of examples and problems to work through.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Just Love It!  Isn't  Legal/Comedy an oxymorom?  The characters are perfectly cast.<br /><br />Aside from legal and comedy the show is very heart warming.

B001FB55H6|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in theaters and it was amazing. After four years since it's release I decided to buy it on blu-ray and I'm glad i did. The blu-ray hd quality blew me away. I had forgotten how great this movie is. I highly recommend it.

B004KKXMSI|1.0|I bought this trilogy because it was cheap. However i should've heeded the other reviewers warnings about the grainy picture quality.<br /><br />The first movie had the worst picture quality of the three. It was very grainy. There was only a couple of moments where the picture quality was high definition, but most of the time it was grainy. Very disappointing.<br /><br />The second movie, The Lost World, had the best picture quality out of the three. It's too bad this is my least favorite movie of the trilogy.<br /><br />The third one had some grain, but not as bad as the first one and i noticed more high definition scenes compared to the first movie. Still though, it was not 100% blu-ray quality.<br /><br />I was expecting blu-ray hd quality from these blu-ray transfers, but that's not what i got. And to the people that are saying, \\"the reason the first movie is grainy is because it came out in 1993\\", that's bulls#$@, because the reviews for the Alien anthology blu-ray set were very good, they praised the blu-ray hd quality of the first alien movie and that movie came out in 1979. So just because Jurassic Park came out in 1993 doesn't excuse it's horrible picture quality on this blu-ray disc.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Like the title says this is a really good, fun, addicting game. However it's extremely frustrating at times, and I'm constantly cursing and screaming. When I play games, I play for fun. This game requires you to use your mind and sometimes I just don't want to do that!<br /><br />Of course they won't even offer a hint and of course you can't skip a level you get stuck on.<br /><br />I've played all angry birds and if you like a challenge and using your mind (and have patience) then this game is for you. It's the most difficult of angry birds. Plus some annoying ad pops up sometimes when moving to the next level.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My one year old grandson loves playing this game with me! It's a perfect game for people of all ages and you learn about the ocean too! Thank you!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This book read like fiction- very interesting with good character development. We learned about the physical challenges as well as the psychological background of the hiker.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I noticed that most of the people that rated 'Minion Rush' gave the game a 4 or 41/2 star rating.  When I ordered the game it wouldn't load, after I e-mailed Amazon it started to load.  Once loaded, when I was ready to play, there were no instructions as to how to play the game so you sort of had to guess and use tactics used in other similar games.  The game itself is okay but I don't especially care for it.
0345528581|4.0|Here's the YAYOG argument:<br /><br />A) Regular physical training isn't optional for modern lifestyles.  Unless you're a subsistence farmer you can count on diseases of affluence.  Even if you're a skilled labourer like me you can count on trauma, and having to cash in a good chunk of your metabolic currency to recover.<br /><br />B) Simplicity isn't optional: the less complicated your set-up and wrap-up routine, the more likely you are to obtain regularity, which is essential to effectiveness.  You simply will not be healthy until you find a program that is simple enough to do every day, wherever you are.<br /><br />C) Resistance isn't optional; cardio alone won't do it.  You'll have to research this premise yourself but I don't think this idea is half as radical as some make out.  Lauren doesn't argue that cardio-respiratory fitness is not important, but American Baby Boomers are as far as I know the only people in the last 30,000 years to believe that static cardio exercise constitutes a whole fitness program. The \\"news\\" is that the ability to sit up from the floor without support is a reliable predictor of mortality, and I would guess that many of the most committed joggers in your neighborhood can't do that.<br /><br />D) Body-weight is better than machines (generally, and all things being equal).  There are exceptions of course, but machine training *tends* to develop muscular-skeletal imbalances and degrade functional neuro-muscular control.  Again, do your research, but I believe that most physical therapists, martial arts experts, and professional athletes will tell you the same thing.<br /><br />If you're convinced by these premises, then you'll want to buy in to Lauren's program.<br /><br />Here's how it changed my life: my great difficulty has always been to win both \\"B)\\" and \\"C)\\".  Running is simple and fun but as a skilled labourer with multiple injuries I can tell you that it's not enough for health and safety.  And it wasn't enough to regain weightand blood-sugar stability after pneumonia.  My dear wife, the mother of five children, can tell you that neither jogging nor a whole library of high-quality aerobics videos were enough to boost her metabolism to stay as lean as she wanted.<br /><br />YAYOG has given better-than-expected results for both of us.  I use the book and the Gymboss Minmax HIIT timer (which you can buy on Amazon); my wife uses the YAYOG Android app.  I ran for years, but in the 20 weeks since I switched to this program I've regained all the weight I lost due to illness plus 10 lbs of solid muscle, very much needed for safety in my line of work.  My back and neck have never felt better, and I can finally carry 80lbs of tools up three flights of stairs without huffing and puffing.  As for my wife, though neither of us track our weight religiously (and she's always looked great), comparing photos of just four months ago we see dramatic slimming and toning.<br /><br />If the present results were all I could report I might not bother with the hour it took to write this review, but this is big thing: we've stuck to it.  A 25-45 minute routine in the morning is now entrenched and it's already endured many of the fluctuations and interruptions that a family of seven can throw at you.  This never happened with any other program.<br /><br />All this said, the book has some serious problems which I hope are addressed in future editions.  First, bodyweight exercises can be very delicate in terms of form.  If you do some of these with poor form, you *will* injure yourself.  At the least, you won't benefit from them.  The book gives very few warnings or tips about form and it's only my years of experience in physiotherapy and occupational rehab from injuries that sensitizes me to the issue.  Until this is fixed, search Youtube for physiotherapist-produced videos of the more difficult forms.<br /><br />One of the great strengths of the book is the graded difficulty of the forms.  Nonetheless, there's roomfor more gradation: particularly in the lower end of the spectrum of ability which includes stabilization and balance.  I appreciate that this isn't a rehabilitation book, but there are perhaps a dozen core/thoracic stabilizing exercises that virtually *everyone* could use (e.g., \\"Bird Dog,\\" \\"Wall Angel,\\" \\"Bridge\\"...) they're in every book on back health, and there's no reason they shouldn't be here--- particularly as they are functionally foundational for many of the forms that are here.<br /><br />There's no warm-up routine here.  Not even a mention of the desirability of a warm-up routine.  I use a traditional chinese dynamic warm-up which takes 3-10 minutes depending on how stiff I am in the morning.  You can find videos of this on the internet.<br /><br />The organization of the book is a bit arcane.  The only thing that might be described as an index is buried after several sections of introduction, and it isn't organized by muscle group or function, and doesn't scope the entire book.<br /><br />It needs a grammar and spelling edit.<br /><br />And that's it for the criticisms.  They certainly aren't meant to dissuade you from purchasing, because as far as I'm aware YAYOG is the first and only book even worthy of criticism for what it intends to accomplish.  And it does accomplish it (albeit with room for improvement in future editions).  Consumers love a label and a charisma, and as Lauren's crew is out front first I would think they'd want to capitalize by making a good thing even better.  If the home workout movement keeps growing as it seems to be doing there'll be a lot of competition for this book soon.<br /><br />Postscript about cardio:<br /><br />Many reviewers give the impression that YAYOG is anti-cardio.  Not at all!  Do any of the \\"All Around Butt-Kickers\\" on pages 133-137, or the \\"Iron Mikes,\\" \\"Toyotas,\\" or \\"Star Jumpers\\" for more than ten minutes, then state in your review that your heart-rate isn't going through the roof and your lungs aren't burning!  I can do this before you've gotten dressed, tied on your sneakers and strapped on your fanny pack to go for your jog.  And no equipment required.  Come on, you Zen Running Cultists, cardio doesn't get simpler and purer than this!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you don't want to pay for the use of a formatter for your book, this will take you through the process.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|played the game for three days and really enjoyed it.  the quests were great without being impossible to solve.  Fun game.
0062068423|4.0|This is a long book that's worth the read.  Another killer for Nesbo's detective to track down, taking us back and forth between the present and the 2nd World War.  Quite entertaining for crime novel readers.
B002KKCVVO|5.0|My friend told me about the teva. I immediately order a pair and have been satisfied ever since<br />. I'm thinking about ordering another pair. ThankTEVA.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Love the CD set of Maca and Wings on their '75-'76 US tour!!<br />Great songs by Paul and performances by Paul and Wings.<br />Some songs by the band members are dogs but I still love turning the volume up and jamming in the car as I'm driving down the road.
006226303X|1.0|This book was billed as a good mystery story and it really was...if you were 12 years old. It was tedious and childish.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|I really enjoy Clive Owens as an actor. I didn't expect to see him in an action film with a lot gun fire. He was surprisingly good in this action role. I also enjoyed him acting with Monica Berlucci. Paul Giamatti makes a good villain in this film.<br />The writing was a little cheesy at times and stretched credibility a little with someone who would have ordinarily died from his gunshot wounds. Overall I liked the film.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Once again Dexter does not fail to keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next! Will he get caught. I for one sure hope not . Hate to see this series to come to an end.  It will be such a disappointment to see this show go away.
B0049M7BDE|5.0|I loved Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo together in this movie. They had great chemistry.<br />This film was well written with some twists and turns plus a little humor thrown in. Denis Leary gave a good performance in a supporting role.<br />One of the things that I enjoyed most about this movie was the soundtrack. It was fabulous. It had a combination of Caribbean music, blues, jazz and Sting doing a fabulous new take on the song &#34;Windmills of your Mind&#34;. I have to say Sting nails the singles that he does on the soundtracks. The soundtrack was so good that I bought some of the mp3's from it.<br />I highly recommend this film. It's one of the ones that I can watch over and over and still enjoy each time I see it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Lots of mini game and variety. Keeps your interest with the story line! Not too easy, makes you think. One of my faves:-)
B001EIOOV8|5.0|Casino is one of the top bench mark films in the mob genre films. It has an excellent ensemble cast that includes: Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone and James Woods. Deniro and Pesci nail their performances in this film. What was surprising was that Sharon Stone did an excellent job of holding her own acting opposite Deniro which is no small accomplishment.<br />This film covers decades of mob control over a casino in Las Vegas. It also covers some of the local and state corruption that allowed the mob control to reign.<br />Casino is extremely well done and will be amongst the list of the best American films. I think it's a must see.
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|As I said, it's a good addition, but it still has some kinks that need worked out.<br /><br />My only complaints at this time are that some files don't like to run in 1080p and there's no list option to see the whole file name(closest I can find is in TV mode and the image to the left still cuts off half the file name). I am unsure of the playback issue cause, but it's probably something to do with how android(almost every device has some kind of &#34;tweak&#34;) handles information between the server and the app since the roku version can stream at the maximum setting without issue(excluding jumping around in the video, which is understandable).
B0038ZITHK|4.0|Carlito's Way is one of Al Pacino's best films. Pacino is a great American actor who also usually has the talent for selecting films with great scripts. That doesn't always happen.<br />Carlito is an ex-con who is determined to cut his mob ties and change his life. The conflict is that others around him are equally as determined to keep him in that lifestyle. The role of Carlito is unusually written so that you feel more empathy for this character than you would expect for an ex-con with mob ties. Carlito's character is anti-hero you actually find yourself hoping for. Carlito's character is what makes this film stand out among mob genre films.<br />I recommend Carlito's Way as a must see.
B00ALKRVTM|4.0|Nice little problems that Poirot solves very competently, with interesting twists in the storyline.<br />After so many stories it does get a bit repetitive sometimes.
B0032KNA4I|4.0|I enjoyed this movie overall. It had a great ensemble cast, good storyline and was well filmed. Woody Harrelson gave a  surprising great supporting role performance and provided some comic relief. This is one of those movies that I appreciate a lot more in the Blu-ray format. The Blu-ray format for this film gives a clearer picture and enhances greatly the special effects.<br />I enjoy both John Cusack and Amanda Peet as actors. It was nice that they were together in this film.<br />The idea of this film came from the doomsday day calendar theory. It makes you think about the what if's. What could be done for humanity to survive and the ethical questions about who would be chosen to survive.<br />Overall this film is well done. I recommend viewing it the Blu-ray format.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|it is a gr8 game it is somewhat hard but that is a good thing I really like this game its fun
B004PR71JC|5.0|I loved the movie and couldn't find the &#34;Rio&#34; soundtrack anywhere. I finally turnes to Amazon.com and found it right away (and at a good price).<br /><br />Even if you're an adult with no interest in a cartoon movie, but the soundtrack. I promise, within 2 minutes into the CD, you will feel happy and ready to move (dance, clean, you'll get up aand do something to the beat of the music.<br /><br />It's a sure fire way to dissolve a blue mood and get you out of bed. This CD is  MUST FOR EVERYONE, YOUNG, ADULT, OLDER AND EVERYONE ELSE.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app really works for me because I travel frequently. This helps me to know what to pack much sooner.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I cannot wait for the new season. I am addicted to this show. The acting is superb  I cannot pick my favorite character they are all fabulous
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved watching all three Season of Downton Abbey and am anxiously awaiting Season 4.  I have recommended it to many of my friends who have likewise loved it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I only used it for one night and it works. It even shows me the weather so i know what to wear. It works great with the kindle fire. You should really get it!
B009PQ5Y4M|3.0|I liked this movie even if it wasn't Aliens 2 Space Marines!!! Love that movie! Whats next? Who will play the new Marines.
B00DB31Y3U|2.0|It keeps going the wrong way every time I go left or right.  The controller doesn't work well at all.<br /><br />.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game, good graphics. Fun to play and easy...Now I just have to get all my friends to play... thank you for making a classic game great on kindle
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My son absolutely loved Angry Birds, and so do I honestly.  I think I have downloaded just about every Angry Birds game there is but Star Wars is my absolute favorite.  It's fun and different.  Be sure to try it out!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Anything Maggie Smith is in can be described as outstanding.I also did not know that the movie was based on a true movie. Wonderful movie for seniors!!
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|This is a very well done thriller. Aaron Eckhart gives his usual top drawer performance. Liana Liberato's performance is nothing to sneeze at. She is convincing from the start. She created a very compelling character. Well worth your time and money to weatch.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Just as good if not better than the rest - hard to stop reading it.  Exciting and a real page turner.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I enjoyed this book as the characters reminded me of my own family members' tales of their goings-ones during WW2. Interesting how it all fell together, but the end was a little saccharine as it all wrapped up. Still, nice for our book club... lots to discuss.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|It fits perfectly & has options to use it in many different positions.  It does not interfere with any input jack openings.  We are very satisfied with this product.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|It's great what else can I say it is exactly what I was looking for so I really like it and I think other people will like it to. The only down side is the commercials but that is to be expected.
B002N2LEVM|2.0|The overall plot of this season is nonsense. It took what was a great premise, flushed it and then tried to be something. I don't know what b/c the writing is horrible, the characters lose all reliability, and it's just a farce. Sad to see because the first season was quite enjoyable.
B005544V6A|4.0|However, I don't give it a &#34;5 Star&#34; rating because I think the torrid sex scenes are unnecessary to the story line.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I'm currently on episode four and I love this season just as much as the last one. It's neat to see what it was like in England during WW1. This is the first series I've enjoyed watching since Desperate Housewives ended and that's saying a lot. :)
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I love the puzzles.  Some are easier than others but the constant chat gets boring and annoying.  I wish it would get to the point faster.
B00DHNJGCU|4.0|A good flick kept my attention and that hard to do. I do not finish 90% of the the video's I rent. Was fun.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|My son found the dictionary useful while reading a book.on my Kindle. He gives it high marks for easy-to-understand definitions.
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|I like gangster movies and also the actors in this movie but unfortunately the story was very boring. Very disapointed.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|Mildly captivating; a bit of a slow start. Seemingly disparate events woven together to a gut wrenching, morally challenging end.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I'm a fan, have been for years.  But even Nora has an off book or two.  This one, is NOT one of those.  It was sweet, had unexpected character traits that simply won my heart from the get go, and was about a dog lover, which I also am.  I learned a lot about the search and rescue process and how to train dogs too!  I've already read it twice.  I re-read my favorites.  It's like sitting down with old friends and having a little get-away.  This one won't be loaned out of my library.
B00COQTZLS|5.0|I have installed Pocket Informant on all my electronic devises.  I like the ability to sync everything to Google calendar.  I have not yet explored even a small portion of its capabilities.  Calendar Informant 3 is my go to Calender.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Love Johnny Depp. He can play any part and it totally becomes his. A fun movie for a stormy night.
0786948523|5.0|Item arrived promptly and is being carried everywhere.  Was a big hit with the kids as  they play this game all the time.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I think it's pretty cool. One of the best Dj apps I've ever gotten. Really cool you get to chat and play music. :) I recomend it even though I thought it'd be somethinf else :p
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I have always liked the Mac Gyver series and would recommend it as a great family friendly show. thanks for making it available
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This movie is more regurgitation than oblivion, with little touches of Star Wars, Matrix, Independence Day, and George of the Jungle.  The creators clearly liked their toy that Tom Cruise flew around in (ok, that was  cool) and decided that it would make up for not investing in plot and character.  They briefly explained the alien invasion, did not fully explain why part of the land on earth was falsely marked radioactive, and did fully make clear the significance or deal with Jack's alter character.  Trite writing, cliche ending...maybe our bar is too high now for good sci fi plots.  Usually I'm not so down on movies, but hey Tom and Morgan, could I, just this once, get my $5 back?
0689835604|5.0|My daughter loves this book!!! She is one and she loves lifting the flaps. This has also been great for getting her to point at her own eyes, mouth, feet, etc....as we read the book it asks &#34; where are baby's eyes?&#34; And then I ask my daughter where her eyes are...and she points to her own eyes. Lots of fun and great learning/ interactive book :)
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|5 stars for this app! Being a Tetris-raised child ;) I love Slydris. Everything is perfect, from the graphics to the game modes, I never think &#34;Ok, that's enough&#34; I can play for hours, it's a nice stress-reliever. Cheers!
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|I'm not very good at it. Just a differt way of thinking I guess. It is fun and a great brain stimulus.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely, outstanding ! Story, plot and characters leave you wanting more each episode. The cinematic view is amazing. I would love to make a trip just to view the grounds.
B0035VFLI2|5.0|Here is nothing bad to be said about this album.  It is addicting and catchy!  Its a must listen every day.  Very happy with my purchase .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really fun game. I just wish that the other places were easier to get to, and I wish that the villians were easier to defeat, but what's a fun game without challenge?
0307895505|5.0|The Prima Official Game guides are a great resource. This one Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Standard Edition was exactly what I needed!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Me and my friends sometimes role play in b-day while the others are Germans, really fun, I recommend for role-playing
B00CL66FEQ|1.0|Seth Grogen, are you kidding me? This movie was so bad that I was ready to flush the 6$ rental and go and whatch cartoons with my kids. While Streisand continues to prove that she can act in a big way, even she couldn't save this awful plot and dialogue.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I really love the style and functionality of this product. The quality for the price was just what I was looking for. It is perfect for my new Kindle , keeping it protected from any damage. Wouldn't change a thing!
B009WUBERW|3.0|Was not really worth having Arnold or Chuck Norris in it. It was ok but the first on was much better.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is a great game if you get bored a lot. It's super duper fun and I love it. I hope you do too.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Characters were pretty one-dimensional. It took a long time to become interested in them. Perhaps the material would have been better served by a non-fiction treatment.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|except for the over hacked, acting job, with the innuendos of previous movies the stars have been in... Good ACTION though...
B005S9EKCW|1.0|An insult to Victor Hugo<br />An insult to the French people<br />An insult to the English language<br />An insult to moviemaking<br /><br />An overly long, extremely boring version of a classic tale.  Unbelievable that the producers did not realize that there is a difference between the stage and the screen.  The abundant use of cockney is not merely distracting, it is vulgar and insulting, akin to depicting Washington or Lincoln with a French or Russian accent.  I cannot think of one saving grace for this movie.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Great story, well told, predictable ending. Realistic courtroom drama with very likable characters. Although the legal issues were somewhat complex, Grisham did a very good job at explainig it in layman's language without going on and on , which would have made it boring. A good, fast read, finished it in 3 days. The first 40  pages were a little slow but once it picked up speed it never stopped. Not quite as good as The Firm, but still highly recommended.
0525478817|3.0|This book was not spell binding, action packed, or lovey dovey.  It was a different but in a good way.  A book geared for the younger audience but the overall story line about 2 terminally ill teenagers finding each other and on a search for an recluse author was enough of a tease to keep me reading on, when it may have been what some others could have considered dry reading.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is funny and fun thnx hope that you come out with more like it my daughter loves the movie and this game
030758836X|3.0|On one side I like the plot and how the book flows b/t the 2 main characters and the 2 different timelines.  HOWEVER, I do not like the over excess use of the foul language.

B008M0TMXQ|4.0|I love my crocs--bought these specifically for boating and kayaking. Easy slip on, slip off and a bonus: they float! But as compared to other crocs, these seem to run a bit small. I ordered a 1/2 size larger than I typically wear (for on/off ease) but these are snug--even at a larger size. Because of the material, I like it when they run larger. So consider going up a whole size for best fit.
B005OP821K|5.0|Great service, great convenience, really fun well done soap opera with excellent acting.  Great to be able to watch whenever the fancy strikes, and to have it available whenever the desire to escape into that intense, immoral, yet understandable saga manifests!
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Product was sent to correct a charging problem with my Kindle Fire, but did nothing to correct the problem.  I needed to replace the kindle
B009K0OL06|5.0|First of all, great to be able to download it onto my computer.  Then, to be able to watch, whenever in the mood, or convenient; that is such a convenience!  Great service, instant availability, and such a fun show.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I love the show.  I binge watched it.  It is fresh and original and has the flawed characters that we have come to expect these days.  My only slightest complaint is that it is slightly derivative of the many war movies that have preceded it, but the fine actors more than compensate for any of that overlay.
B000QJM8Z0|4.0|Bridget Jones is the literary character that every women identifies with.  A funny and entertaining book and is beautifully written
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey was a great surprise.  I did not expect to like it.  I expected it to be a dull, Masterpiece Theater of British descent, but it was witty and charming as an Oscar Wilde play, adapted for the pacing of modern television.  The show is not predictable, and neither is the writing, which is flawless and poignant.  And who can not love the Dowager?
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Not since Angry Birds has there been such a fun game!<br /><br />Although you can achieve instant gratification by purchasing coins and gems, it's a lot more rewarding to nurture your shark and earn your rewards.<br /><br /> Every shark 'handles' differently, so take some time to learn about your shark before you go exploring. I prefer the finger control mode, as it feels easier to control than whipping my tablet around.<br /><br />Last - hope this isn't much of a spoiler - watch out for the mini-sub!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|They writers have enjoyed themselves as they have branched out in all directions and played with the available stereotypes and exploited each character's idiosyncratic nature for maximum humor.  Never miss it.
B00BEIYMO2|3.0|It doesn't take very long to notice that Planes is a watered-down film. All you need to see is the logo to realize there isn't much to see that's new. A ridiculed dark horse makes his way to the big leagues, realizes he must change to continue the course, and with the help of his friends shows everyone who's the real winner. I'm beginning to wonder if a non-Pixar animated studio will be capable of releasing anything different for a few years (save for the HTTYD and CWACOM sequels).<br /><br />The similarities, or copies, of ideas in the Cars films were more annoying than engaging, because they didn't often develop past what Pixar did. There are only a few good reasons to see this film, and here is one: watch it to find and list all the references to concepts in Cars (such as a fuel aficionado).<br /><br />There is one concept that I enjoyed seeing developed, only because Cars 2 showed such a limited scope. This concept is travel, seeing the world, beautiful views and different cultures. Because the race is all around the world, you get to see many, many places, and the vehicles that live there. My absolute favorite was the German bar, so watch for it if you choose to view Planes.<br /><br />The dialogue was mostly geared towards children, with a few exceptions, and didn't have the dual charm (children and adults) that Pixar has mastered. Still, I laughed on occasion, and I've seen more embarrassing scripts.<br /><br />The animation was exactly what I expected. Slightly less precise than Cars 2, but only slightly. Where the movie excelled the most, in my opinion, was in the camera angles. They were an absolute treat throughout, despite it being an animated film. The 3D was good, but didn't have any scenes where it stood out.<br /><br />Here is one more good reason to see Planes: Dane Cook. Throughout the feature, his voice acting stood out as quite a talent to watch for in the future. As a side note, I didn't appreciate the John Ratzenberger cameo, as this wasn't a Pixar film, and he already has a character in the universe. Take it how you will.<br /><br />The only surprise that came to me was the \\"ride into the sunset\\" moment. I wasn't expecting a bold change, but it still happened. What came after the credits cleared it up, but didn't make me feel better. Planes: Fire and Rescue is a full-length sequel being planned with the same screenwriter. I'm more than a little disappointed they already approved it.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is great for kids, but adults can busy themselves counting the \\"rip-offs\\". See Planes for the beautiful camera angles, vehicular takes on cultures and landmarks, and Dane Cook, but expect little else to impress.ixar film, and he already has a character in the universe.

B008M87GJK|5.0|One of the best new sites, they report fair and unbiased news. They actually report all different varieties of news throughout the world, giving you the facts and less of their views and or opinions.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Very useful summary of well know facts about the way our behavior depends on our habits. A model produce by H. Triandis, in Interpersonal Behavior covers the same topic for an academic audience.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Fascinating and very well written biography of a singular personality who literally changed our world. The author's knowledge of that era and of the tech world is remarkable, detailed and unbiased in descriptions of Jobs and his relationships personally and professionally.

B00DH1G7DS|2.0|Part of the challenge of sudoku is the micromanagement of numbers.  This version of sudoku automatically revises your notes when you place a number and tells you when you are wrong.  Subsequently when you are wrong you have 60 seconds added to your 'score' for which I have no issue, however, the first time I placed one incorrectly was because I fat fingered the number.  I did not notice that I fat fingered a number and instead just saw that it told me a I was wrong and ended up frustrated seeing as how that number was the only option (I tried placing it again and it was correct, so I came to the conclusion that I must have fat fingered the number).  Otherwise the game looks good and doesn't appear to have any major bugs.<br /><br />I got this app as a free app of the day.  Thank god I didn't pay money for this.  Only get this if you really suck at sudoku and want to feel better about yourself.
B005HEPN06|5.0|Love this show! Lots of fun to watch. Brings back memories of whatching it when I was younger. Would recomend this one.

1451695195|4.0|Not the usual white light tunnel; this gentlemen from the educational stand point seemed to know what he was talking about and experiencing.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|The book starts off a little slow but once it gets rolling you'll find it impossible to put down. The return of old characters is done artfully and new ones add color and humor. I'm just sad it's ended. Please start at the beginning of the series to get the full impact of the main character.
B002M9WW30|5.0|This is a great item to have. This film series is a great story of an ordinairy guy who suddenly finds himself on a path to drasticlly improve his life. Along the way he pushes through several physical and emotional barriers between his goals and his friends/family. The ride, while bumpy at times, is very satisfying and rewarding for the watcher. The really good thing is that each movie has Rocky tackle a different obsticle for different reasons.<br /><br />Moving away from the movies, the set itself is pretty impressive. The movies do have slight quality issues but, it's very easy to brush it aside and forget the problem, except for the first film. In the first movie there are scenes where one character appears blurry and has shadow all around him/her but all other characters look bright and clear. While I haven't seen every extra, the ones I have seen add a lot for the movies and it is great hearing Stallone explain what he did with the character he acted/created/changed.<br /><br />Not every movie is 5 stars but, the set makes up for the majority of bad marks I would give some of the movies. Very recommend.
B000NY12LO|5.0|A spectacular novel and I will read it again! The climax is great and the ending is wonderful and not so wonderful...

No more 5x7 notecards at home, notebooks filled at work, or even my Christmas gift list notebook. They have all been replaced by this program. I'm completely electronic now and all my devices are synced so that my lists can be updated wherever I am. Evernote is the answer to all my questions. :-)

B0020MKTOS|5.0|Gran Torino used Hmong people, none of whom were professional actors.  This movie is a tribute to Clint Eastwood as a director. Also, the movie  was a wonderful lesson in the evils of racism and stereotyping.  It even had humorous moments even though it has a violent ending.  There is no greater love than to give up a life for friend.

B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I found this film very entertaining but it did not follow the fairy tale very much.  There were too many giants and miscellaneous characters.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|If you like action and a cool character, this movie is for you. Loved it! So did the rest of my family.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|This movie was quaint and cute as well as entertaining.  I would put it in the same category as &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34;.  I am an adult and come from the &#34;Cinderella&#34;, &#34;Snow White&#34;era so it takes a lot to tickle my fancy.  This movie is enchanting for children as well as adults!

B00004R95G|1.0|I cannot watch this on a US DVD player.  It is made for European players.  I purchased 2 and it was a waste of money.  I contacted the seller but got no reply.  Now I see a notification on the seller's page but did not see that when I purchased.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I play it on my kindle, would love to be able to play it on my laptop too..Got my friend on it too
B004GYY714|4.0|This is one of my favorite apps, and I probably use it every day to listen to my favorite radio shows.  Use it on my ipod touch when I'm within wifi range.  It used to work on my android (Samsung 4G) but it doesn't work on that device anymore.  Too bad.

0871403633|5.0|This is Wilson's best book on human evolution and human nature.  The book is basically divided into three sections: human evolution, insect evolution, and human nature.  The chapters on insect evolution are tough slogging and can be avoided without losing any meaning from the rest of the book.<br /><br />The most remarkable insight is the conflict in human nature from two separate aspects of evolution.  First there is individual evolution which rewards the selfish behavior of individuals at the expense of the group.  Then there is group evolution which rewards the altruistic behavior of individuals to the benefit of the group.<br /><br />The two together determine human nature and settle the question of whether we are selfish or altruistic because we are both.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I truly Love this series, I am devastated at the ending! How could it end up like this for Mary? cannot wait till season four!
B001MTENOC|5.0|This was one of the most provocative books I have ever read.<br />I believe the expression is \\"I couldn't put it down\\"; but I had to put it down regularly to have enough time to assimilate the<br />contents!  I will be thinking about this book for quite a while.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I just love Follett. He makes you feel and smell the world of the 14th century. It is an excellent sequel to Pillars of the Earth, but there is absolutely no need to read Pillars first. If you like historical fiction, this book is an absolute must.
B000FC13Y0|2.0|Was a disappointing to me,in that it wasn't really explaining all the characters that well. I also that the storyline was erratic and not fully wound together.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|As a lawyer, myself, I enjoyed this book although I would give it just an ok. Give it a try but don't expect a lot.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun and challenging games to play. This game has just the right amount of challenges to make it somewhat difficult but also to keep it fun so you want to keep playing.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like the fact that this app keeps a history of your math and your work. It's a great tool.
B00D6QUJ6U|3.0|I really love this concert.  People who normally don't like the Bee Gees will find something enjoyable about this concert.  Even if you can't stand their disco output will find some of the disco songs on this concert to be somewhat enjoyable.<br /><br />From TV, VHS, DVD and now the Blu-Ray, Bee Gees - One Night Only has seen plenty of video formats and TV broadcasting.<br /><br />Now the best for some of you is that should you buy this Blu-Ray release?<br /><br />Video:<br /><br />Lets get this out of the way.  The video isn't too great on the Blu-Ray format.  The quality is more like just a regular DVD, just upscaled.<br /><br />But wait, if you look at the front of the Blu-Ray case it will say \\"SD Blu-Ray.\\"  On the back it will have a notice saying:  \\"Eagle Vision's SD Blu-Ray range presents upscaled standard definition original material with uncompressed stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound for the best possible quality. \\"<br /><br />Read this note carefully, the video isn't the most important part of this release.  The video can go up to 1080i but this is just an upscaled picture onto the Blu-Ray Format.<br /><br />Also regarding the video they chop the screen aspect ratio down to 16x9 1.78:1 Widescreen.  The original video was in 4:3 so parts of the top and bottom of the video is cut to make it widescreen.  Not cool in my opinion....<br /><br />Audio:<br /><br />The main reason why I purchase this Blu-Ray in the first place.  Uncompressed LPCM Stereo 24-Bit/96kHz and a DTS HD Master Audio surround sound.  If I remember correctly, the previous DVD only supported Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound.  Both Dolby Digital and DTS are lossy compression formats (makes audio fit on a DVD but at loss of fidelity/details).  With LPCM it is uncompressed and has the full fidelity of the source material.  For DTS HD Master Audio it is lossless compression, music that is compressed but no loss of fidelity.<br /><br />With Blu-Ray huge storage space we can move away from Dolby Digital/DTS and just use LPCM, DTS HD and Dolby TrueHD.  I use a headphone setup (Grado RS2i to Audio-GD NFB-15.32 DAC/AMP) and the LPCM Stereo track is excellent.  Everything came out clear and with my setup I can hear plenty of details that I didn't notice before.  Compare this to my CD copy, the Blu-Ray is better.  I haven't listen to the DTS HD track since I only use headphones and I have no surround sound setup.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray will only benefit those who have audiophile-grade equipment.  If you are using speakers from Wal-Mart and such then the Blu-Ray not will benefit you that much.  If that is the case then you are better off with the DVD release.<br /><br />Personally what I did with this Blu-Ray is able to copy the LPCM track from the Blu-Ray to my computer and convert it to FLAC lossess format.  24/96 Audio whenever I go, cool I say.<br /><br />In the end forget the Video and only buy this Blu-Ray if you care for the Audio.  I don't regret my purchase one bit.  3-5 stars.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Life in those times well portrayed by the cast and great fun to watch. Are we really that different today?

B0037VNX44|2.0|I thought Clockwork Orange was strange.  This one takes the cake.  I'm not sure if I'll ever be the same after watching this one!
B001EBWIUO|5.0|This is such a phenomenal study of what happens to the psyche when searching for gold (and then finding it).  But the film is much more broadly conceived, because this psychological study can easily be applied to the search for wealth in general (illicit trade, but also legitimate business, as well).<br /><br />Great acting.  Great script.  Great cinematography.<br /><br />But don't expect fast-acting, overdone musical scores, and special effects.  NOPE.  This is a &#34;GREAT&#34; movie, not an overdone cinematic videogame.
B000TDDHQ2|5.0|Eno.....One...why the heck do I need to fill this space with however many words the red print is telling me...
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I'm not too well versed in the GI Joe back story, but this movie tells a decent story about some of the characters
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Oblivion is a good futuristic science fiction movie that has good special effects, good actors, actions, drones, and more. I typically can predict the story line in most movies, but the twist in Oblivion wasn't what I expected. A nice surprise. I liked the movie and its worth renting.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Best a cgi kids movie of all time. Such a great movie for the family. Tis movie will never get old.

B003QS9VYE|3.0|It's not nearly as good as I remembered and has no real life teaching for children to relate to these days.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Well done, professionally directed and acted, but didn't forget for a moment that it was Tom Cruise on the screen.  If you like the genre, you won't be disappointed.  But will you remember any of the plot tomorrow?  My guess is not.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The slow and gloomy pace made it hard to stay awake which make it hard to understand the twists throughout the movie.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Action-packed, plot not too confusing, Renner does a fine job that makes me forget Damon.  Great stunts and camera work.  My husband likes this genre and this is one of the better ones.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|What can I say about this product that isn't obvious, I love it with all my heart. Thank you very much
B00BHMF578|4.0|Nice movie, well acted and directed.  Everyone underplays a bit, which helps endear you to the characters.  No jingoism, just a couple of decent guys doing the right thing and a happy ending.  What more do you ask for in a movie?
B008FPOIT6|5.0|My book club read this!  I recommended it to them and I was so glad that I did.  It is intriguing, interesting, and quirky.  The characters are original and you'll want more to read after it ends.  I loved and enjoyed every part.  I could not think of anything I would not like!  Highly recommend it!  Read it now!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Better than the average action movie because of the superb CGIs and a likable cast.  Predictable, of course, but fun getting there.  Good job, Kenneth Branagh!
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|This game is very fun, but very Facebook based, so even though you can play without a Facebook account, the game puts on a lot of pressure to sign in. The game is also based off of tokens. To play a game  of Uno, you need one or two tokens. You get a certain amount of tokens at the beginning, but when you run out, you either have to buy more with real money, or you can't play at all anymore until you get a scratch card, which gives you a certain amount of tokens. Overall, this game is not worth it if you don't have a Facebook account.
0812982622|5.0|Many readers have pointed out that \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" incorporates several different genres, from bildungsroman to love story. The central character, Jun Do, even disappears into a North Korean gulag and emerges as----someone else. However, as well-written and interesting as the novel's shifting perspectives are, they aren't the only things that make this a wonderful novel.<br /><br />It's all about the research. This is as knowledgeable and as in-depth a look at North Korea as you are likely to find, all wrapped up in an enthralling work of fiction.<br /><br />Lest you doubt Johnson's bona fides, look no further than some of the nonfiction material that generally gets little notice, unless you're a specialist. There are films like \\"Crossing the Line\\" and the wonderful \\"A State of Mind\\"; memoirs like that of the deserter Charles Robert Jenkins or the prison memoir \\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang\\"; third person accounts like Barbara Demick's \\"Nothing to Envy.\\" Johnson's has read and seen it all, and then some. (He also traveled to North Korea, not an easy thing to do.)<br /><br />Through \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" you'll travel to a place that people can barely imagine, so isolated is North Korea. And you'll be in the hands of a travel guide cum novelist who knows as much as anyone can about this perfect Orwellian state.<br /><br />M. Feldman

1781162646|5.0|No one can paint a picture of a time and place as well as Stephen King when his mojo's running strong.  Joyland is right up there with It and 11/22/63 in terms of creating a nostalgic picture of a time past.  This book reminds me so strongly of Ray Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" in tone.<br /><br />His characterizations in this story are very well thought out and creative.  For me, they brought back memories of devoted friendships in my early 20's.  His main character was a fully fleshed out college student who I fell for completely.  He is moody and kind, generous and a typical 21 year old trying to decide what to do with his life.  The second love interest was a charmingly quirky person whose interesting past plays a vital role in the story.<br /><br />While this book isn't horror, it does have some supernatural moments that add a thrill to the story, like only Stephen King can.  However, the mystery and the horror play a back seat role to his characters and their relationships.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I love the story line.  Mac is always getting in trouble and Barons saves her.  Her creativeness of the situations are amazing and always leaves you wondering, how is she getting out of this?!  The tension between characters is palpable.  Fast paced action.<br />I would recommend this series to anyone that enjoys fantasy-romance.<br />I am wait for her next installment to find out how Mac, Danni and Barons are all doing.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Great app. It is so difficult to add fractions but this developer found an answer. Works perfectly Try it now
B00DM11LV6|5.0|It's a very good movies and wishing u could get it at a reasonable price. I truly enjoyed what the meaning of love is all about
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I LIKE THE EASE OF USE AND THE CONVENIENCE OF HAVING A PORTABLE ALARM CLOCK WHEN I TRAVEL .  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP!
B009P5S11G|4.0|Based on some of the more popular songs from this album but it actually was halfway decent. It definitely wasn't Rihanna at her best but it was an album worth owning.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun. I love taking care of my horses. and its so competing I have so much fun playing this game!!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|this is the last book.. I'll miss reading about Bon Temps and all the entities who inhabit is and the surrounding areas;0)
B008JFUO36|3.0|This film and Prometheus are similar in that are both beautiful to look at, have decent acting, and stories that raise interesting question that are never fully resolved.  I will say Prometheus had a slightly better story than this one hence I rated it higher. At the end I was more confused than anything else. The movie \\"Moon\\" actually did a better job with the same sort of theme as this movie. Movies where the puzzle pieces are revealed slowly and we are allowed to try and put them together are fine. But when all the pieces have been presented, and you still feel like there are major pieces missing and others simply don't fit....it is frustrating. I can only recommend this as a rental. Too bad, it could have been very good.
B004S9AK7C|5.0|Once again he has done it a very enjoyable read both my husband and I red it while on holidays and having enjoyed all his books
B008JFUN50|1.0|I just saw Elysium on its opening day. I left the theater knowing I will never see it again. Over 140 years in the future, those on Elysium, a huge orbiting space station with an artificial earth environment, live pampered lives with access to medical care that can cure any illness and nearly any injury. Those on earth live in a polluted environment, work meaningless low paying jobs with zero access to Elysium's state-of-the-art medical care. (Not much changes in the future - that's the underlying message of the movie!) The goal of all is to buy a counterfeit citizenship for Elysium and be illegally smuggled to said space station.<br /><br />While Matt Damon did a credible job as the ex-con Max who must get to Elysium to cure his radiation poisoning (caused by an unfeeling corporation, nothing changes there either), the movie overall was not worth the price of the ticket. The plot is contrived and makes little sense, the action/fight scenes are impossible to follow given the rapid camera movement and angle changes, and the audience is never given an opportunity to invest in or much care for any one character. The last fifteen minutes forces you to suspend your common sense. The code for a computer program that will reboot the entire computer system of Elysium is locked in Max's head and must be uploaded to Elysium's mainframe computer or all is lost.  It simply defies all logic that Max's supporters manage to illegally land their ship with zero opposition - all other illegal ships tended to be destroyed by the stations defense forces (called Homeland Security no less) - and then encounter little in way of security (human or android) before reaching the undefended, unpassword protected, and easy to use computer console that controls everything. Furthermore, the computer code stored in Max's brain was completely unencrypted, required no password to view or install, and, finally, resulted in irrevocable changes to the computers running Elysium's defense and support functions (or at least the joyful ending would have us believe).  One always has to suspend a certain level of belief for a scifi movie, but Elysium asks us to check our brains at the door of the theater.<br /><br />If you like action without letup, computer generated backgrounds galore, an excess of profanity, and illogical plots then this movie is for you.  I went to see it because I was impressed with \\"District 9\\" and generally like any Matt Damon movie. However, do not waste your money at the theater.  I recommend waiting to see it some cheaper way, if see it you must and hopefully I didn't reveal too many spoilers.  But this movie is not a fine wine and will not improve with age.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|I really liked this movie.  The acting was great.<br />It has a good story line and the scenery was breath<br />taking. It should be noted that this movie should have<br />a \\"R\\" rating attached due to the language and violence.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|Pathetic. Saw it on the opening day and walked out half way through. I had hoped that the McClane father-son thing would be fun to explore, but as I discovered that would have required a good screen writer, producer, and director.  Since day one of it's release in 1988, I have been a huge fan of the original Die Hard - a brilliantly paced thriller with truly witty dialogue and engaging characters, both bad and good - and have bought it on VHS, then DVD, and finally Blu-Ray. This movie consists of nothing but mindless destruction, crashes, shooting, fighting and stilted forced dialogue. It is possible that the movie is redeemed in the second half, but I doubt it, given the number of other one star reviews and others had similar reactions. I recommend seeing this movie but only after you have seen every other movie in existence.
B001CNMDUO|4.0|it is a good movie, good story line and good acting. It keeps you<br />interested all the way to the end.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I found the picture quality to be excellent on my received copies.<br />I never did like the last story tho&#34;.
0062255657|5.0|I am never disappointed with Neil Gaiman and this book was no exception. I just wish it was longer, I could've read that story forever.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and engaging, more levels please!<br />A 9 yr old and a 47 yr old had a blast figuring the game levels out together.
1781162646|5.0|Im extremly pleased with this purchase! Being a major Stephen King fan this was a great purchase. I would recommend this book 2 anybody who loves Stephen King
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|In summary, I love this device and will be travelling with it.<br /><br />The wireless setup is quick and easy.  However, you need to secure the wireless.  By default, anybody close by will have full access to any content on this device. I would suggest changing its name, make in hidden and give it a password.<br /><br />The Battery backup feature is handy, but don't expect a lot from it, its battery is small.  But, its great to get you through the day until you can recharge.  I think it strikes the right balance.  As a bigger battery would add some weight.<br /><br />There is a problem with connecting to older wireless networks - it doesn't connect to a WPA protected network, only WEP and WPA2 protected networks.  This is great as WPA is not very secure and easily hacked.  But is poor, if it is the only thing available, and you can't get to it - I would rather have access and be aware of the security risk than have no access.<br /><br />If you are using it on an Andriod, consider the ES File Explorer, great for managing your storage.<br /><br />The one design flaw, I felt they could have built a better on/off switch, especially for the money you pay for this.  The first unit I received had a broken switch and would not turn on.  The second unit works, but it is not as solid as the power switch for my phone or other smaller devices I have.<br /><br />New firmware is available for the device, but it fails to load.  That concerns me as they should have gotten this right.<br /><br />I would also liked a Windows App so that I could easily access it from my laptop.  You can access the device using a browser, but not nearly as nice as a common APP interface.<br /><br />I would give it a 5-star if the switch was better and it didn't have firmware update problems.
B007DA2FHG|5.0|This was a very  moving movie full of love between man and animal. A father love and respect for his son.<br /><br />g
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really liked the first person, short story format. I was reminded of the early days of the first outbreaks of HIV and how denial, shame and political expediency shaped the future of that disease. The military blunders were dead-on as well. I was also impressed by how little we actually see of the undead and more of the aftermath of panic and ignorance. The movie has very little in common with the book so you are not as tempted to make comparisons. In general, I don't like zombie stories, but this one grabbed me and would not let go. I recommend it for zombie fans and non-fans alike.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is a well told story that is both inspirational and informative. I listened to it during my runs. I've been running for years but this book has began my education in becoming a better runner. &#34;The best runners leave no trace&#34;.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|I found this story exciting from start to finish. It could have come straight from today's headlines. It reminds me that any illusions about privacy disappeared long ago. Dan Brown intertwines fact and fiction so seamlessly that you begin to believe it all. By the end, I was was not sure who the villains were. Perhaps there were none. Maybe be we are trapped between the walls of safety and privacy so tightly that there can be no right or wrong solutions. Just like Edward Snowden, Ensai Tankado will be judged only by his own conscience.
B008YW5RH2|4.0|The instructions are simple and can be addicting and you can hit lot's of cool shots. It makes me go out and play tennis!
B000FBJHZS|4.0|I was hardly able to find a place to pause. The imagery was so vivid and I actually could feel the cold down to my bones. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was that there were two instances of &#34;deus ex machina.&#34; I can forgive this because the story and the characters made it a worthwhile reading experience.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Spent two weeks searching my Kindle and clearing space,  but it remained full even after clearing all books,  video and games.<br /><br />Clean Master cleared 4.6 gigs in 30 seconds.  Awesome.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good story line, puzzles were fun, not too difficult. I liked that you have three difficulty levels to choose from. Really can't think of anything negative  to say. Lots of fun and  I recommend it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It helped you see life through a teenager struggling not only with being a teen in high school but dealing with emotional issues. It made part of me want to share it with my teenagers but yet another not because I wanting to protect them.  I believe I will share and discuss.  A great book. The only part didn't like was not knowing who the letters were to.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I was totally pulled into The House at Riverton from the very beginning. Kate Morton sets the scene of this novel, just as she does all of her novels, from Chapter 1 and never lets the reader go! Told from the viewpoint of an elderly woman whose life was changed by her time in the house, this novel rewards the reader with unexpected twists and turns in every chapter. I felt drawn into the time period and could easily visualize the house and the inhabitants. The ending was appropriate and unexpected.
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|If you have never read the book the movie is good.  Read the book it is so much better than the movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Reall what could any one say its an App to let you on facebook  reall what can be said about it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works flawlessly, must have for the facebook junkie. It really makes things easy to get to facebook. I highly recommend it.
B000V6738U|4.0|Nice representative collection from a distictive band. A reminder of their extensive work. I forgot about a couple of these great songs until I got this album.
1611761840|5.0|But my granddaughters never got back to me to tell me what they thought of it.  What is the grandma to do?
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a great game.  It does have a server problem from Disney and does stick at times.  Otherwise it is great fun to play.  Grandkids love it.  Graphics are fantastic.  Lots to do.  If it stalls just quit playing and it usually starts up again okay.  Still it is worth it.
B0001I561E|5.0|If you love the old school pen and ink animation, this is a great movie to add to your collection.  Robin Williams as the voice of the geine is just icing on the cake.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My granddaughter showed me this one and I thought I would try it.  Keeps me going for hours.  I let grandpa play it, it keep him playing for awhile, with some laugher now and than.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The only problem with Season 2 is that it ended and there is no more Suits until Season 3 finishes sometime this year. I'm not sure I can wait that long. Wish there was some way to stream Season 3 after it has aired on TV.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|I liked this story which really conveyed the indepth methods investigators take<br />to try and fight the drug war.  Bosch gets over his head and again goes beyond<br />his reach to undercover the truth of his friend's death.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I couldn't believe that I could get so involved in a TV series the way I did with Suits. I burned through season one and season two in a matter of days, staying up all night on some nights just to see the next episode.
B003GK2216|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Doesn't seem like it is 1100 pages long. I have read most of Follett's spy novels plus The first two of the new trilogy, but was missing Pillars and World without end. I cannot wait to read Pillars now!
B004SVM7BW|5.0|It is so easy to use.  Just install it and it works like a dream.  I was having trouble viewing things on my Kind, no more!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is such a fun game. I can't wait until I get more coins to play again. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Skyworld is Two Steps From Hell's best album. I'm a daydreamer and i think It makes you dream a lot!
B004S5D3B6|5.0|True life flick that makes you want to go back and watch this boxing family. This is when boxing was boxing!!! Loved it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My husband & nine year old son absolutely love this game.  Its part of the reason we had to order another Kindle Fire HD.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|You do not get enough directions on some of the quests can be a pain. But it is also fun.<br />Noreasterner@comcast.net
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I would have loved to try it out but it wouldn't run at all after it was installed on the Kindle Fire HD
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|In theory, could be a good concept.  Everyone on a drug to eradicate emotions of hatred and sadness, etc to solve the worlds violence...but the actors keep smiling and even laughing at times...ruins the premise.  Don't bother
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We have enjoyed Angry Birds Free.  It has been a lot of fun for the whole family.  Easy to use!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Really enjoyed season 1 of The Good Wife.  Great drama, always leaves you wanting/needing to watch the next episode!  Addicting!
B00D3V85FA|5.0|True to their roots. Great Music from the Masters. Only Black Sabbath could have done this, And the WannaBe's can stuff it.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I really enjoyed this. My only criticism is that the story drags in some places especially in the first half where many groups of characters are all traveling to different places at the same time.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I think this game is a perfect combination of hidden object and actual story plot. Not only that, but this game isn't over in 30 minutes! Loving it!!! I have downloaded so many hidden object games that I eventually stopped playing bc they were terrible and/or boring! Not the case with this one! I literally could not wait to get back to the game whenever I had to stop playing. I hope other games r just as good! Thanks, Nevosoft!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love love love this series. I love every moment of it , best show on tv at this time.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Well, it isn't Star Trek's computer, but it does find answers for me.  So far, I've asked it about local earthquakes, prevailing wind speed, and Avg wind speed and direction for my little town, and it hasn't let me down yet...
B000FBJG04|5.0|This is a book I recommend for all readers interested in World War II ! Made me appreciate with the freedoms I have today given to me from our Veterans.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|As some have stated, close as it comes to Hitchcock thrillers of the past.  Worth watching for sure.  Keeps you captivated with a slow buildup.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was a fascinating read. John Green's style of writing makes The Fault in Our Stars readable by teens and adults alike, but be warned, the subject matter is a bit heavy for the younger readers. I could not set this novel down until I was done, however the ending was somewhat slow paced, so I give it a 4 star
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is that one love.........the love that borders on insanity, danger, desperation and passion.  It's that love........this was a wonderful read!
0385334206|4.0|I had not read Vonnegut since my college days in the early 70's but enjoyed the revisit it was a little dated but enjoyable.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Fantastic movie for ALL music lovers!  I have always loved behind-the-scenes documentaries, and this one absolutely delivers.  Best music movie I've seen in a loooooooooong time...
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's fun l &quot;am  building without spending real  money it can be done  it just  takes longer l  have penty  of  time
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great ending to an amazing trilogy!! Can't wait for the movies. All good thing must come to an end sometime.
B00004SZWD|5.0|This is one of the classic album/CD;s of all time.....It is a masterpiece among masterpieces. THIS IS A MUST HAVE
0064431789|5.0|This was a favorite book of my children and the grandchildren love it just as much.  It is timeless and I enjoy reading it to them.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It was a great story and the loved the actors. it was a feel good movie.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The album is awesome. Not only good beets but also great message in some of the songs I really &#60;3 this album.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Great love story ! The characters become alive with their stories and the ending is awesome !  READ THIS BOOK
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Stephen Stills is an institution. With a half century of songcrafting to chose from, this set hits almost all of the right notes. My one gripe: No Super Sessions.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I recently read the Divergent Series and The Hunger Games series and this one falls pretty close to being on par with both series. I am currently reading the Scorch Trials (book 2) and so far it's been great.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|THIS VIDEO SERIES WAS AND IS THE BEST. THE VIDEOS ARE FANTASTIC ON MY KINDLE FIRE. I HAVE WATCHED SEVERAL OTHER VIDEOS ON MY FIRE AND THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE.
B0053O89WY|4.0|But there it was -- buried under the wrapping -- haven't tried it yet, but I'm assuming it will be like the first four seasons
B00B4FU6KE|1.0|most of the members of my book club loved this book.  it left me with an empty feeling for  the damaged characters.  the father was self serving making his family victims of his experiment.  not only did we see how animals endure pain both mentally and physically  in the name of science, but here we saw a family of humans included in the suffering.
B000X1YDCM|1.0|I got the dvd and it doesnt even work. Lost the paper and cant send it back. Very upset and wish I could get a refund
B00821OX98|4.0|Falling Skies isn't groundbreaking by any stretch of the imagination, but it is well done and entertaining.  For the most part, the acting is convincing, and the storyline has very few logical holes.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|What can you, almost makes me want to get HBO to watch but still can't justify the cost.  Maybe I will get a free trial on HBO soon.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|This app is great for all ages.  As well as it allows me to share to social websites and things in that order.  In conclusion I feel as though this app is worth the ninety nine cents. That is my review.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Good series<br /><br />Sometimes it slows down coming across the server.  I would recommend the series to others. waiting for the next season
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Content a bit hard to follow due to the time when it was it written.  Too wordy.  No problem with the E reader transfer.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|5 stars because it is a great game that is fun and challenging and my 5 year old can even play it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Not nearly as good as the other two books.  I totally did not enjoy how it ended, and now I have to wait for another book and pay more money in order to have a conclusion.  Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Love this movie!  Wonderful, interesting animation.  Love the facial expressions and personalities of all the characters, even the ones you just see for a few minutes.  The music is upbeat and memorable.  You'll be humming the tunes to yourself for quite awhile afterward.  A+++
B00DVXVMT6|5.0|Chimaira has redeemed themselves. Great riffs. The solos are moving and Kevin's drums have greatly improved. Mark brings it like always and I can't wait for another album. Even the slow songs are addicting. Its one of those albums that you hear new things each time you listen that keeps it going.
B0058SNKNS|3.0|I take a 7.5 size shoe so they said to order 1 size up.  Big mistake the size 8 was way too big - I was walking out of them.  The size 7 fits alot better.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Pleasant way to become acquainted with the period.  Increased understanding of the division of the classes and what was expected from each.  Looking forward to season 4.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE AND I HAVE READ THE BOOKS AND THE ONES IN THE SERIES.  AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I really liked this book when I started it. But as I read it and the main character branded himself with his girlfriend's nickname... I realized it reminded me of a Dateline episode or some type of relationship that ends with someone getting murdered because the boy with the anger problem gets jealous and murders the girlfriend or a random guy he's suspicious of. And the girl's randomly awesome at poker/gamboling? Um, dumb.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|It was rather rehearsed and centered on the greatness of Henley and Frey, which is deserved, but still an interesting piece. Would have loved more recent comments from Linda Ronstadt.
B00005JMYI|5.0|A movie with Will Ferrell will always be great. He makes the movie more entertaining as does Steve Carrell because Steve is the best.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|The first time I heard Yeezus, I thought Ye had lost his mind.  It was so far from what anyone famous was doing in hip hop, I didn't get it.  I'm pretty open music wise, and I like genre' bending artists (M.I.A., Gomez, Muse, Radiohead, etc.).  However, I'm a hip hop head first and foremost. When most rappers try to genre' bend, it sounds fake/generic (Flo'rida, etc.). Luckily, I heard Yeezus on Spotify, so I could have multiple listens.  I respected Kanye's music so much, I had to give it second chance.  It started to sink in.  My mind started to change to his creative point of view.  The third time I listened to it, I almost teared up.  Genius!  I immediately bought the download and bumped it non stop for over 2 months.  All of the tracks are dope, but the stand outs for me are Blood on the Leaves, I'm in it, and Black Skinhead.  The last track Bound2 and first single New Slaves are the most conventional, but are still ahead of their time.  The rest of the tracks are so far ahead of it's time, most people won't understand or be able to relate.  Therefore, they will dog it.  Kind of like the people who didn't understand \\"The Matrix\\" when it came out and just dogged it.  I think most music listeners by now have heard Yeezus, but I'm just here to say give it a few more listens and try to expand your mind before you judge.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I only need a very basic calculator and this one fits the bill. Very easy to use and un-cluttered. Download it now
0064471837|5.0|This book is fantastic! I was reading this when I first met my husband... and then he read it and my sister in law read it. It is wonderful!!!! Such a great suspenseful and intriguing story! I listen to it on audio book very frequently and we own 2 copies of every book! Pick it up! Very empowering story for women!!! #SabrielDay
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this on my Kindle fire and my Galaxy 3s. Works flawlessly It has helped me pass many hours enjoyably
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is a great way to pass time and tickle your brain.<br />I got it for myself,  but the whole family likes to play too.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I loved it. I love post apocalyptic stories and this is yet another slant with a lot of twists Some of the concepts are hard to wrap your head around but interesting. As usual Morgan Freeman does an excellent job and Tom Cruise is well Tom Cruise action hero.
B003M70O5O|5.0|you are never going to know what is coming next- well written.When you watch an episode you will not want to wait for the next episode
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This movie caught my wife and I by surprise. Incredibly well written and acted on all points. This is a must have movie!
B003TTCURU|4.0|I never watched the show when it was on before. I am really happy to get a chance to see it now.  Thank you for offering it on Amazon Prime.  I can't wait to watch the next season. N A.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Just about the time you thought Star Trek had nothing left to offer,,,,, surprise! Holds well with the Star Trek tradition for adventure.
B008D30K7E|5.0|Loved this book - real joy to read. Lovely whimsical style of writing that really engages you throughout. Highly recommend for a joyful read!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I spend my free time playing this game then waiting for more coins so I can play some more. It's one of the better bingo games out there. I even got my mom hooked!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game once I start playing I can't. put it down. I would recommend to everyone. Friends and family young and old. its also my 4 year grandson's favorite.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I have only positive things to say about Jermaine Cole and his 4th studio album 'Born Sinner'. This album is flowing over with creative genius and the production quality is top shelf. J. Cole is a gifted story teller in the mold of Kendrick Lamar (who happens to be featured) and Lupe Fiasco. Cole knows who he is as a rapper and has fun with the freedom that gives him to express himself. It certainly shows as this is the most original album I've heard since Kid Cudi's 'Man on the Moon' series. Solid from start to finish, every song has the potential to become your new favorite. It is definitely worth every penny and then some. Buy the album, don't rip it off the internet. The quality of the music will be better for it and you will be better for it. Why steal from someone that has dedicated their life to sharing with others? Besides..... there is a nostalgic feeling that comes with owning a CD decorated with the original cover, disc and centerfold art (which were done beautifully). Be sure to get the deluxe edition, which includes 'Truly Yours III', the likely last..? installment to his most recent mixtapes (5 songs). Buy through Amazon and the mp3 versions of the songs are included for instant download, so you don't have to wait for 'Born Sinner' to arrive at your front door and superman kick it the *expletive* down.
0307730700|5.0|This is one the best true story books I have ever read.  I cried at the end if this book!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Thoroughly engrossed in Ender's training that I was completely surprised where that led!  You'll have to read to find out yourself!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|So far, the weather info given by this app has been very accurate.....I check it on a regular basis to determine how to plan for trips, what to wear to work, &amp; etc.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Other than thinking I heard \\" I'm on f-ing vacation\\" too many times, a decent movie, but not as good as other Die Hards.
B008133MDK|5.0|Wonderful show. I wish there were more than 3 episodes a season. The acting is first rate! As good a production as Downton Abbey.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I had to wear this watch up where the sun don't shine for three and a half years before I was finally able to get it home to that boy's father. But, a promise is a promise.<br />The boy is very happy with the watch, and the quality has surpassed even the toughest times.<br />Five stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Excellent App. Good graphics, Stats, many functions, I'm sure  more information that you really going to need, use or you imagine.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Interesting to know how a person with this condition thinks and why they behave in a way that is seen as &#34;different&#34; .  Enjoyed the story and the outcome, the topics and the insights.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|It's good. This app doesn´t have any special  if you compare it with others, but is functional,  useful and it's free
B0090KZDSK|2.0|More of the same but no outcomes as far as why Gideon is so messed up.  Was disappointed that this 3rd  book did not divulge more about Gideon and their future.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It's  and app  necessary, useful, practical, easy to use  .To me, you must have it. the best of all,  it is free
B000FBJAEG|5.0|A thrill on each page and continuous movement through the story.<br />His stories are so believable you can't really believe its fiction.  I<br />know from life experience that government bureau leadership is<br />not always the best for the job.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Easy to use, many songs, albums, ratings by countries, tags, you can hear and/or buy the songs . I really enjoy this app
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The book gives multiple interpretations and comparisons to other research and documentation.  But aside from that it reads like you might be in the time of Jesus of Nazareth and have some insight.  It is a shame that the actual life of Jesus had to be &#34;dressed up&#34; to please the civilities of each era to entice into organized religion.  My review does not do Mr. Aslan's research justice.  You have to read the book and perhaps go further to read some of his references.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Excellent. Easy to use, really functional and necessary for maintenance . It´s an App that you must have in your tab.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The animation is of extremely high quality, never blurry and very realistic. If you cant have a real horse this app is the next best
B00005N6KG|1.0|This used to be like $8.  Now they are $40?  They only last a few months so they are pretty much disposable.  $40 is crazy.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My horse is an awesome game. It really lets you feel like you're taking care of an actual horse. My fave part is the jumping.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Family can be the best of times or the worst. In this story two families become one.  This is a sweet story well worth the read!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I needed something to protect my KF and this has done all it said it would easy to use has protected my KF on several drops and splashes. I have to say it gets an A+ from me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is  Oh so AWSOME. This I the first minecraft game I ever played. When I first download it, it REALLY blew my mind, because it had everything you cod possibly need, the thing that I don't like about it is because they still haven't installed the 7.2 version anyway buy it it's REALLY BLEW My MIND!
B00499QUK2|5.0|A great modern version of Doyle's classic.  The mysteries and plot twists are everything you expect from something claiming the title of Sherlock.  Holmes's apparent lack of interest in social niceties is perfectly complemented by Watson's awkwardness adjusting to civilian life.<br />We were so thrilled, after watching the first season, we went out and bought several copies for friends and family.  A must see.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|this game is kind of short lived. But it is a wonderful brain teaser.we really enjoyed playing this game. this is also something great for kids who wants to expand their critical thinking process.
B0043URV5U|5.0|If you like Bob Seger, you will LOVE this.  The best Bob Seger cd I own, all of his awesome songs.
B00C3W0850|5.0|I have been a fan of this group for a long time. I have purchased all of their albums. Bliss is an expert of illiciting emotions from the subtler sounds. The music is smooth and flows coherently from one thought or emotion to another. The first song to the last are all done thoughtfully and are all just as good. This album focuses more on music that is influenced by the mountains and desert. Worth all the money it cost. I can listen to this over and over.
B005VSRFEA|5.0|An amazing first reader for systems thinking - Meadows breaks it down very clearly and simply for the novice to systems thinking.<br />I enjoyed this book very much and it has helped me rethink my thinking about systems from the ground up.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I am addicted to this game. It's easy but challenging at times. It has easy to follow instructions. It's colorful and very interactive. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My husband loves anything &#34;Harry Potter&#34; and loves this collection.  Anyone who loves Harry Potter would be happy with this collection, which is not always available in stores.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|One of the best games on Android, hands down. With addictive gameplay and a wonderfully dark soundtrack, this game will drive you as insane as the characters in the game. Excellent.
B0090SI582|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and I was doing some online interweb paroosing and came across a couple sites that quoted James Mangold as saying that an unrated version may be released on blue ray.  However it doesn't look like this blue ray version includes anything unrated.  Can someone shed some light on this for me?  Thanks.
B000002J5K|5.0|I feel forced into writing these reviews. If you like the movie, and you like the style of music that the movie represents, then i suggest you get this album.
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|As an amateur musician, I was completely entranced with this movie, from story to actors to soundtrack. I only wish that such a retirement place existed!
1781162646|2.0|I wanted to like \\"Joyland\\". Really, I did. There was a lot going for this one: An Amazon \\"top 10\\" of the year, a pulp-y cover that promised sex and violence, and of course that it was written by none other than Stephen King who has really been on a tear lately with books. Why, then, did I feel so let down when finishing it? Why did I feel like I never accomplished my original desire to like this book?<br /><br />Misleading as this book was (\\"Who dares enter the funhouse of fear?') I do have to give some amount of praise to good old King. The guy can still craft a good coming-of-age tale like \\"The Body\\". And he still has the ability to pull on your heart strings the same he did way back in \\"The Green Mile\\". I'll concede that his characters weren't as strong as say Danny Torrence from \\"The Shining\\" or John Coffey (\\"like the drink, just spelled different\\") but you have to at least agree that Dev was a believable 21 year old with believable 21 year old dreams and aspirations. Annie and Mike made nice additions (even though the death of one of them -I won't say which- is almost a tear jerker) and of course, there was still that unbeatable style and flow familiar to King, enough so to keep me reading.<br /><br />I kept reading through the first half of this novel, enjoying the way things were going, guessing at the who the murderer could possible be, and how Dev would undoubtedly unmask him and save the day. Unfortunately, that whole part of the story is only hinted at in the first 50 pages, revisited for another 10 pages about half way through, and then wrapped up in another 10 page conclusion. In between you have the whole Annie and Mike thing (which isn't bad at all), and Devin coming to grips with his broken heart, his new job, and \\"putting on the fur\\". I'm not complaining about this stuff; I would say all of this was a sweet, slightly tender story that was a bit removed from normal King fare. Yet, I do have to ask, where were the damsels screaming in terror? Where was the \\"fear\\" we were promised on the cover.<br /><br />I think my biggest problem with \\"Joyland\\" comes and it's blatant misrepresentation. I get that it's a pseudo homage to the men's adventure and action stories of the 40's and 50's and those things were almost always sensationalized, but honestly, I expected a lot more from King. Especially considering what he's written in the past; the short story \\"Throttle\\" first comes to mind. We were given the promise of fear and terror, violence and maybe dark, illicit sex. Instead we have the ponderings of a heartbroken 21 year old virgin (although the line \\"What I know now is that gallant men rarely get p****y\\" was a crack up), one or two brief violent paragraphs, and some random ghosts that are there as a rather badly used \\"dues ex machina\\".<br /><br />My other complaint comes at the length of this story. When you can read a book cover to cover in under 5 hours, it is too short. \\"Joyland\\" was about 286 pages too short. Calling this a \\"novel\\" is a pretty far stretch when you know that King has published some pretty hefty tomes in his long and illustrious career. Maybe an \\"extremely long short story\\" or a \\"lengthy novella\\" would have been a more apt description. Also, why I'm on the subject, I am a little disappointed that there was never any ebook version produced. Don't misunderstand me, I love owning books and displaying them on my bookshelves (and yes I have ALL of King's other novels in this prosaic form), but don't you think $12.95 is a bit steep of a price for a book that doesn't even top out at 300 pages? To me, this seems a naked attempt by King and Hard Case Crime to ream more money out of a book that could have easily sold for 5 or 6 bucks on kindle. It's not like King needs the money, right?<br /><br />Unlike Dean Koontz, who I have officially written off as dead to me, and who I will no longer continue to support, I still have faith in Mr. King. A guy who has written upwards of 30 novels and who knows how many short stories is bound to have a stinker or 2 in his repertoire. I'm not even going so far as to say \\"Joyland\\" is awful or really THAT bad, it's just...forgettable. Hey, at least it'll look good stacked up, spine to spine, with it's heavier and beefier brothers [[ASIN:1476735476 Under the Dome: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1451627297 11/22/63: A Novel]]
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Had no glitches, lots of levels, fantastic graphics engaging puzzles and good hos scenes. Not so hard that you go blind trying to find everything lol. I really enjoyed it.
B00DM0XXCM|1.0|It's a simple silly story more like a fairy tale and might appeal to kids.!<br />You want 5 more words.  Will boring work?
034580404X|5.0|I purchased this trilogy for my wife and she absolutely loves these books. These content is a topic every time I hear her having a conversation with her friends
B006MW3V6U|5.0|WE ENJOYED THE STORY LINE VERY MUCH, KIND OF LIKE A SOAP, BUT MUCH BETTER STORY. THE CARACTERS ARE WELL CAST AND A GREAT PROGRAM WITH NO SMUT.  THANKS
B001FEO6PK|5.0|Rocks! Well I will have to come up with 18 more words so I will have to repeat that this album rocks!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's writing style is so creative and realistic, that it causes me to think about what I am reading and how it really has such a true meaning about our Government Operations and what really goes on behind the scenes and how truly we are so fortunate to live in such a Free World.  The situations are so true and bring out the real life emotions that we face daily.  I know that I am reading fiction; but it still gives me great cause to Stop and appreciate those News Breaks that we receive, when something happens that our Leaders think are important enough to call them to our attention now, whether than to wait for the scheduled news broadcasts.  It also gives cause it believe that our world leaders are people like us, with real attachments, loves, fortunes,misfortunes and heart wrenching situations.  I look forward to each new book, and am so glad that I introduced this Author to my Grandson while he was in High School.  Back when I was reading books I passed them on to the School and many or the Teachers expressed their Thanks for bringing him into our Private School.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I have 3 grandsons who are crazy for this game. As soon as they walk in the door one one of them is asking if they can play it.
B00004CZN9|1.0|I was duped when I bought this movie. I got it for my boyfriend's birthday, and I was so excited for him to unwrap it because he loves it, used to watch it all the time when he was a boy. I'll never buy from this seller/scam artist/dream wrecker ever again.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Whole family enjoys it (ages 3, 7, 11, 12, 40, 44)<br /><br />Great to have funny, wholesome entertainment for the entire family
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|The  philosophy of the  'sacredness of the food we eat' and our attention to the beauty of it have never been so exquisitely created  nor appreciated.  THE most beautiful food film ever made..not just for sushi lovers, but for anyone who needs a connection or reconnectioon to sacred gifts!  One's spirit  is heavily touched!
159463176X|3.0|Enjoyed the book as I was reading it. However, I kept waiting for something memorable to happen that would tie all the characters together. At times, I was confused as to whose point of view the chapter was being written. For me it was disappointing. Loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My son thinks this game is just like Subway Surfers with Minions instead. Not very original. It's a fun game, But he says the end of the world challenges are hard.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I would play Temple Run 2 over Despicable Me anytime of day. I just find it's easier to work with.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is the beat game ever you should get this app it's where you mix elements and create more and more
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|I love these books.  They're very witty reads.  The dialogue is witty, and the scams the characters pull are inventive. There is enough heart that you do get attached to the characters, though.  When Amazon first recommended this book I thought, &#34;ehn, another orphan-thief-makes-good fantasty blah.&#34; and ignored it.  But Amazon recommendations are very persistant, and I finally purchased it in a moment of weakness.  I'm glad I did.  It's an easy read - well but lightly written.  I blitzed through it in a day or two, and immediately bought the next book (which was at least as good, if not better.).  Now I'm waiting for the conclusion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun get it now i play it all day long Austin Stewart log on to Facebook and get 5000 awesome  players Jake<br />Tricky sun coco
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Presents today's scientific understanding of the physical world and how it came to be what it is, in clear terms that a non- scientific person like me can understand. Avoids the stridency he has sometimes previously exhibited towards religious believers. This is a good summation of the non-religious believers scientific world view that a religious believer must understand to effectively engage in any dialogue on the existence of a personal god.
B00280LYHS|4.0|I decided to reread this book because the movie for.the first book is coming out. I remember why I love this series but its at a very low reading level for me.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This story has many layers which can be explored from the fascinating legal system to the intricacies of family relationships to the reactions of your so called &#34;inner circle&#34; of supportive friends and neighbors. It is worthy of a reread to explore the story from differing points of view! Quite a story!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game ever i love this game its like 3d this game is very hard whitch makes it really fun i love pixar i seen the movie an now the game AWESOME :)
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I found this story to be very sad and depressing. Although some of the characters seemed to &#34;shine&#34; the overall atmosphere was one of gloom. I was disappointed in several of the adult characters and their reactions to the daily struggles of the young patients in the story. Perhaps I am too much of an optomist but I prefer to emphasize the positive. The glass can be viewed as half full sometimes and not always half empty! Death is a major player in this story and the young characters seem to acknowledge it, however, the adults seem to be holding the half empty glasses! Very sad, realistic?
0525478817|5.0|( I first posted this review on [...] )<br /><br />This Review ( if you can call it that ) is gonna be hard to write, Since i’m still not over it. After finishing TFiOS, the tears just wouldn't stop. My Review isn't gonna be long, for i can't write this without crying. It took me longer to finish this book because of ALL that. Like i had to keep shutting the book and then open it again. I don't know why it took me so long to buy this book, well i guess i do cause i usually hate reading about realistic fiction( i am more of a Dystopian person and Etc ) but i do not, Not ever regret buying this book. The Fault in Our Stars has completely changed my life and how i view it. This book has already means so much to me. It is a very sad book, but it’s still very Beautiful.<br /><br />John Green you are my hero!!!<br /><br />I think everyone needs to read this book. Yes you are gonna cry ( and if you don't you have no soul ) Yes you are gonna want to throw this book or lock it with a key and lose the key in the ocean, But it is soooo worth the read. I PROMISE!<br /><br />Now i’m gonna go cry in my bed.<br /><br />Okay? Okay<br /><br />( i know my review probably sucks BUT YOU JUST DON’T UNDERSTAND HOW FREAKING HARD IT WAS TO WRITE THIS! Sorry for caps )
0385344228|4.0|Some words are, thank goodness,not part of my vocabulary, but was able to read over them, very surprised ending, our book club will review on the 13th. Look forward to other opinions.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Daughter loves this game. Very cute graphics and easy to play for all ages. Daughter adores littlest pet shop so it's perfect for her. I even play.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|We all listen to different music (classical, country, heavy metal, blues, rap, pop, folk...) so it's rare when we like the same band. This is the band. This is album is wonderful. Not a stinker in the lot =)
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|It's ok I mean well yeah it's just ok. You might like it. But I don't really like it. Its okk
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Lived with each character of the story while i was reading the book.I sensed the humanity and love in every character of the book.<br />The booked really touched my heart.Every character is a protagonist .<br />I have to really congrats Khaled Hosseini for such a master piece.
0439023521|5.0|The book is in really good condition and the actual book is so good. I definitely want to get the whole series now.
B00CL6GAD2|5.0|Absolutely one of this years best movie.loved how he looked with a beard. I love that it was a true story.edge of my seat
B008HK3XYK|5.0|this case is good, its tuff and protect well and stands up well. various colors to choose youll like it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel was full of all sorts of twists and turns! It was hard to put down! Great fast read!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Basically good but would like a game that I could play for more than a few minutes without having to buy time.
B005PK56TA|5.0|My kid sister just finished it. She loved American horror story. Can't wait to finally get the chance to watch it
B000AOA2G8|5.0|the tool works as expected, a great quality product. Had no problem loosening a rusty bottom bracket with this tool
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book was a game changer for me. Pressfield is brilliant and I immediately went to order the rest of his books when I finished this book. A must read for anyone who breathes
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Given the collapse of the Soviet Union, he has had to go to other places for his plots. This one is Le Carre in fine form, if not Spy Who Came in from the Cold or Tinker Tailor, it is still right up there. Recommended.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have nothing bad to say about this app, only because I have nothing to compare it with. After all I'm finally upgrading from a 3g phone : )
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Love this movie. One of my top 10 comedies and now in BLU RAY!!!!! its a win. BUY IT NOW!!
0762451319|4.0|Revision: Most recently I was at a party and was playing air hockey. I leaned down and my pendant got caught in the goal area. I got it out safely, however the cord snapped. Ill be looking for a new one to wear the pendant on - which survived and looks as good as ever.<br /><br />The box - as other reviews have said- is extremely small. The necklace pendant itself is smaller than I first guessed however it fit around my neck perfectly. The tattoos ar small as well - much smaller than those in the movie appear to be - although they do come with directions to apply and tell the names of all of the runes. The magnets look cute and good on true fridge and can actually hold small papers down - just not a lot. The little booklet has a lot of quotes and pictures. Over all this went above and beyond my expectations after reading the other reviews. Maybe the necklace doesn't fit right to other people because they have somewhat of thicker necks? And neither the pendant nor the chain have affected my skin badly. Love it!
B005LAII4E|5.0|I wasn't able to see this when it was at the theater, so ordered as soon as Amazon listed it!  There was one part I did not like (will not put a spoiler out here so you'll have to watch the movie to see what I mean), but loved the movie!!!  Just like the first one, there were relationships, some background of the characters, and a LOT of action.  If you like action flicks like I do, you should enjoy this movie.  :-)
B0096HIEE2|3.0|The only way to get to writing a review, or leaving a message, is to rate the item.  But I cannot rate this film as I have NOT received it yet, well past delivery expectation.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|It's not going to make it into the cannon but this is a great story that's very well told.  And to top it all off it's true!  Give it a read and then watch the series on Netflix - there are some considerable differences between the book and show but both are enjoyable, entertaining and thought-provoking.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|very light, nice color, easy on and off when I need to connect something to the phone (adapters tend to be built to never account for a cover). not obtrusive (doesn't make phone much larger).
B009WUAK2M|5.0|You know what this is all about if you saw E1.  Same thing only more over the top.  Lots of cameo rolls for Stallone's friends.  It was fun.
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|Definitely one of the best classic Action movies I have seen in awhile.  Plot isn't surprising, but they never really are.  Mark does a great job and is even better as a Prime film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is the best game ever made. I think it should be 5$. Greatest game ever made if you love horses. I would totally recommend It to people who love horses
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like the game but I am not sure if the little coins that you can get bananas with (and other items like an extra life), is it like diamonds in Hay Day, or what?? Like if you have a game, it has coins and another item.. for this bananas and those coin things, ar..those only purchase-able or watch a video or what?? Other than that I love the game!
B001FB563E|5.0|As most people who have read Cormac McCarthy know, his books tend to be difficult to adapt to screen and The Road has to be considered the most difficult. It manages to succeed beyond what I expected. For those not familiar with the story it is the story of a father and son as they try to survive a never identified world apocalyptic event. More than an apocalypse story it is at its heart the story about the power of love between a father and son. Not for the squeamish and not for those who insist on a happy ending but well worth it otherwise.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This was an eye opening book. I enjoyed reading of the lives of individuals in North Korea. Their stories each tugged at my heart.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|GAME IS A LITTLE HARD AND YOU DON'T GET TO EARN ENOUGH COINS ETC SHOULD BE MUCH EASIER AND FREE TO EARN!
B00821PCJS|5.0|I've never been one to watch TV, so I'm usually the last to know about a great series like this. But I started this while down with the flu, and loved it.<br /><br />In general, great characterization, though they all tend do do things I find inexplicable - but that just seems to be how the series is written. At its core, its about all those values we as Americans hold in common -- bravery, family, compassion, hope, fortitude -- and its a story about being your best even when the world around us is at its worst. Throw in great aliens, creepy crawly things, and underdog heroism, and all you need is a bag of popcorn.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is great. You get to share your news with people, without the intrusive privacy invasions that facebook has recently become. A+ app.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Real life events...I can see this story unfolding in today's high school setting.  Great character development and story line.  Great read!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|My news source for literally everything (okay not everything... but...). It is a great app and it allows you to follow many of your news insterests, from fashion to video games to movies to general news, it is all there. I must say, viewing my twitter feed on this app is not my cup of tea, but other than that, great way to stay informed in the world! A+ app
B002R27J1W|5.0|Audrey Hepburn was nominated for best actress in this movie and, I think, should have won it (the award went to Katharine Hep-burn, in a rather non-spectacular part).  In this movie, Audrey Hepburn plays Susy, blinded in a traffic accident, who has accident-tally come into possession of a doll stuffed with heroin.  There are some bad eggs (led by a horrible sadistic Alan Arkin) who are after the doll, and Susy is at risk.  I remember seeing this in the cinema, and there was one place toward the end in which there were lots of screams; I didn't scream, but my heart jumped into my throat at that point!  A great movie.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I recently had to remove my faceobook due to privacy concerns. If they are part of the National Security Agency, I want NO PART!
B0035JRVR8|5.0|This was Audrey Hepburn's first Hollywood movie, and she won Best Actress (deservedly).  It's a delightful movie throughout, with Gregory Peck showing some unusual comedic talent (he was usually cast in deadly-serious roles).  The first part is just plain funny, but the ending is bittersweet.  Eddie Albert also brings some fun to his part, and the movie is a joy from start to finish.  Highly recommended!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It is like they decided to rerelease the EXACT same game. I mean true, they added a few effects and what-not, but if you were tired of playing the first one, you will be exhausted of this one in a mere 10 minutes. I know I was.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Can't for the life of me figure out why Cloud Atlas was panned. The best I can say is there was no good way to describe in a 30 second trailer the potential that nearly 3 hours of film could amount to. Please watch.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I don't think I listened to a better CD in 2012-2013.<br /><br />This CD= all of Pink's talent + Will.i.am's talent + One Direction's talent x 300,000,000
B00E193TM2|5.0|I listen to it while exercising. I didn't think I'd like it so much, not really my kind of music. I picked it because the lead singer was in the movie The Devil's Carnival and I loved his voice.
B00DB31Y3U|4.0|In this game, you fly around a small helicopter while doing certain missions such as landing on a helipad or shooting coke cans. It is fun for a time.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|We haven't received it yet. Know we really like and have heard the songs on it.  Will be glad when ours arrives. Thanks
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app is great because without it, where would those poor PDF files be read? This is a great app for kindle, and I have no problem supporting Adobe, a great developer.
B0099116AY|5.0|Enjoyed it so much we had to get.  Thanks Again!! Have shared it with friends and family they enjoy it also.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|There are not enough words to say how exhilirating this movie is!  It's awesome in every definition of the word. Wonderful, just wonderful!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book. I'm not a big fan of fiction books but this is one of the best I've ever read. Definitely five stars!
B003TNW044|5.0|Hands down, this is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen and this particular season proves why \\"Friends\\" was and still is one of the most hilarious sitcoms in all of television history!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|vrcfrfttggyggbbtb that means  super fun just like all those other running but with minions its super fun that's why I gave it 5 stars
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Stardate 91212.91 - I concur that this is one of the best movie sequels I have ever seen! What are the certain factors that make this film as awesome, and possibly even better, than the film that preceded it? It could be these:<br /><br /> -A gripping story featuring the characters everyone knows and loves<br /> -An amazing villain portrayed by \\"Sherlock\\" actor, Benedict Cumberbatch<br /> -A dazzling score<br /> -A great twist ending that ties to the original series of films that  preceded this reboot series!<br /><br />  Overall score: (110/100) (6/5 Stars) (Highly Recommended!)
B00094OBS4|1.0|never could play dvd .no dvd player could play it.It was supposed to be in good condition .have tried to play on numerous dvd players with no avail
B000E97Y6K|5.0|I am happy to say that I feel this 2 Disc DVD set is highly recommended to any DVD collector! There are plenty special features to keep any movie fan, Peter Jackson fan, any fan occupied for hours and hours and hours! An amazing movie that's even more amazing on a 2 Disc DVD set that is completely cool in every definition of the word! Highly Recommended!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Looked real,  could never get a 100% clean water test...my daughter used it anyway, and yes after it got wet the iphone had issues, still a little buggy, but working.<br /><br />Now the water test is bad enough you'd never put your phone in there....trying for a replacement.<br /><br />Amazon Prime shipped by the way.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This is one of the most interesting animated films I have ever seen and everything about it is awesome: the voice acting, the music, the animation, the story, and the set design, and everything in between! One of the best films Blue Sky and 20th Century Fox has ever released since \\"Horton Hears A Who!\\".
B006VZS1EA|5.0|Love the special effects, and story line was good too, Saw this movie awhile back and enjoyed it even more watching it again!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Each character so vividly portrayed and coming alive. I could not put it down. Most delightful, the scent of caramel filling the air as the sights and sounds of the night circus surround you. The conflict, the romance, the curiosity of a small boy and the gradual comprehension of what makes it gloriously entertaining,these are what make The Night Circus so wonderfully unique. It is exploration of that state so captivating between dreams and reality.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I was given a copy of this book to read by a friend of mine and after reading it, I have no regrets. What I enjoyed about the book is how masterfully the author connects the four agreements to real life situations.  Similar to [[ASIN:B00ED2Z8U8 Curb Your Thoughts: How To Create The Future You Need, Heal The Pain Of Unworthiness, Overcome Negative Life Patterns And Live An Authentic Life]] both authors uses their personal life experiences to connect more with their readers. I have really cannot say anything bad about both books and both authors should be commended for a job well done. I highly recommend this book and give it 5 stars!!
B00886XQO0|4.0|Great headphones! I would have given 5 stars if it had a low battery indicator instead of the annoying &#34;battery low&#34; voice every 2 seconds. Price is a little steep but through Amazon I got it for $100 off.
0143123173|5.0|Combines a murder, Western lore, a touch of mysticism and an unbeatable Western setting without resulting to cliches.  Walt Longmire is a crime-solver to love!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is cool because you get to take care of a horse like you have one.The graphics are awesome clear and realistic. I rate this app 5 stars.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Okay, so I'm going to start by saying I love Sylvia Day. I love her imagination, I love her writing style and I love her ability to create a character so incredibly HAWT! Let's face it Gideon Cross is absolutely D-licious.<br /><br />I was happy enough to give this a solid 4...until the end—if that's what you can call it. The story from start to non-finish was alright IMO. I knew before its release that there were another 2 books in the series so I was not in pissed-orf-angry mode when I picked it up.<br /><br />Now, do I think the story should have been wrapped up in EWY?...yeah, I do.<br />Am I happy I get to read more tasty scenes centered around Gideon's enormous c**k?...yeah, of course I am.<br />Did I like the book?...yeah, I did.<br />Did I like the ending?...NO, I FREAKIN DIDN'T. In fact I hated it, it was just BLAHHHHHHHHHHHHH *imagine me lifting things up around my house looking for the ending to the book* Is it under this cushion?...no. Under the rug?...no. It just wasn't anywhere. NO ENDING..<br /><br />What I did like about the book was Gideon and Eva's growth, I loved their newfound trust for one another, there playfulness and their scorchin, sizzling, sexy sex.<br /><br />Now, do I still love Sylvia and am I gonna read the rest of the series as soon as they are released?...sure am, and I better not have to wait so bloody long.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|This was ordered for my husband because he loves this movie.  He wants to be able to watch it when ever he can.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Screenwriting Perfection. And the little boy, you just want to eat him up, he's so adorable.  This is definitely on my all-time best movie list.  Must see!
B004NS710C|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen.  I enjoyed the action pack movie and want to watch it often..
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Enjoyed  reading this new novel by Hosseini.  There were several places in the book, that described perfectly my personal feelings about events and challenges that I had gone through in the past several years.
B003J5UIRS|1.0|Book touts children's memories of previous lives but most are repeats of what Dr. Stevenson described in his excellent, well known work on reincarnation. Read the original work instead.  Author worked with Dr. Stevenson at UVA and this reads like it was written by a TA.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was amazed at how much my boyfriend and I actually enjoyed watching the series!  The actors and actresses were superb and the setting exquisite!
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|Mark Wahlberg showed his range in this movie.  There is a nice little plot, a little political intrigue and a little violence.  One good bad guy, one really bad bad guy and the carnage they cause. Well worth watching
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Darius is a marvelous songwriter as well as performer. He has the ability to make the everyday spectacular. I believe it comes from his heart and soul.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I got exactly what I wanted, several minutes of big name stars interacting with real and unreal military hardware with a little plot to put it all together nicely.  PS - I am a huge Bruce Willis fan, so my opinion was slightly biased from the start.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|I love Tim Burton's movies.  Sadly his Dark Shadows is almost flat-out BAD.<br />The usual Burton dark humor and satirical characters are there and are<br />well-cast, the sets have the usual pseudo-horror touch and the costumes<br />and technical aspects are first rate.  BUT, and this is a big but (remember<br />Simone the waitress with Pee Wee in the dinosaur?) the script is totally inane, lame<br />and ready flame.<br /><br />It is always a risky business doing an adaptation of a popular television series as<br />a feature-length movie and this one proves that even the greatest most imaginative<br />director and expert cast of actors cannot save a fundamentally half-assed screenplay.<br /><br />What a cast though!  Wasted wasted wasted.  Johnny Depp is his usual great self as<br />Barnabas Collins, he single-handedly saves the movie from total DOA status with his<br />sly, funny delivery of the occasional comedic lines.  And Helena Bonham-Carter is<br />very funny as Dr Julia Hoffman. [Spoiler alert];  After this character dies the movie<br />nosedives.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer is always a reason to see a flick, but her transition from the<br />marvelous cat woman in Batman Returns to the vague and languid Elizabeth Collins<br />is almost a total flop.  Again, not her fault.  The script strikes again.<br /><br />Eva Green is so beautiful but looks ridiculous in a blonde wig, and her American<br />accent is noticeably studied and fake.<br /><br />This movie is, in a word, awful.  I am so sorry about this.  It is a first in my<br />experience of Tim Burton.<br /><br />Don't waist your money on this turkey.  And don't do it again Tim!!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is very fun and entertaining. Simple, yet challenging. I could play this game for hours and not get bored.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy the simplicity. Fun game. This game is a good one if you are looking for a good pass time. Play a little here and a little there. If you want to blow through a game, this isn't for you. Play the game right and its like an interactive clue, that hasn't made much sense thus far but it's cute.
B00A822VDY|5.0|Great movie. I can't really tell the difference between DVD and Bluray, but I just got a Bluray player and it looked good. I like having toe DVD also so I can watch it in other rooms.
B0047WJ11G|5.0|Thrilling movie that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat. The graphics are cool the concepts is great. The acting was wonderful. I found it refreshing in today's episode 1,2 and 3 formula movies. So burnt out on the usual cops, medical, and love stories! This was totally different!
076790592X|5.0|This book is one of those books that really takes a place in your heart and really touches your soul. Another book that really did that for me was \\"The Alchemist\\" by Paulo Coelho.<br /><br />It's quickly read but so enjoyful. Recommended for anyone who likes books who really come out and \\"talk to you\\"
B003477DVK|5.0|As one of those viewing who actually lived contemporaneously with the narrator of this story, I found it most enjoyable and accurate in detail. I felt as though I recognized every single character (including Skip) in my own boyhood of that era. Five stars? Not nearly enough for me!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids and I are having so much fun with this game! The minion s are adorable, the devices are awesome, and we have tons of fun! The only downside is it is hard to earn tokens, and they want you to pay for extra items and upgrades. Still, entertaining!
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|Played to lvl 11 then deleted. The basic gameplay is fun plant &amp; produce to advance. My beef is just that as you progress the quests require you to have neighbors and to get dozens of specific items from said neighbors in order to build and complete. Too tedious. Not why I play a fluffy game like this. Also an excessive mount of syncing issues.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game with my kids although my 4year old is better at it then me it's a great game to sit down and play together
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Intense with great effects and design. Cruise does not disappoint with his apparently ageless ability to perform stunts. Definitely worth the rent if you don't want to own, but I chose to put this in my library.
B00000F5KH|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. But let me say that the commentary is set to start with the movie and you must turn it off. Yes it can be done. The set up looks different than most films but took me a minute or two ti figure it out. Enjoy the move.
B00DU74U74|4.0|This movie was better than I thought it would be. Kudos on the director for making it decent to watch, because the book was semi slow going.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|I have to have this on Dvd.  Anybody listening? Santa are you real? I promise I'll be good. For real.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was a great end--maybe not, but with the advancing ages of its stars, and the fact that at least three of them are now on hit shows, probably so--to one of the best series (sci-fi or otherwise) of all time! Mal, Zoe, Wash, Inara, Book, Jayne, River, Simon, Kaylee--one of my favorite ensemble casts of all time!
1594745692|5.0|Ive had several decks none as awesome as these. Worth every penny. Received them  within two days. Easy to read and wasy to follow
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is one of the better low priced games I have played in quite awhile. Plus I enjoy the game as it is without having to add anything unless I want to. Thank you for a great product!
1439130833|5.0|First off i have to say, I ordered it because my sister had one and it looks awesome. The meaning behind it is even better
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Every once in a while you run across a game that a surprises you. This is one such. Having played tetris in the arcade on an upright machine, this as well as any other 'take' on tetris has a great deal to live up too.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, and almost instantly addicted to this well thought out adaptation of a classic video game.<br /><br />I would recommend it highly.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I thought by the description it would fit my new kindle fire. It didn't so I had to send it back. Had it fit it would have been fine for the purpose intended
B008BU75IQ|5.0|His is my favourite author and I hope he continues writing more books.  I can't wait for his next book.
0385537670|1.0|I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading this series. The books are SO repetitive and the story is overly drawn out! They don't really seem to get up to anything particularly shocking and the sex scenes quickly become monotonous. If you've ever had decent sex, don't waste your time you'll definitely find this book boring.
159463176X|1.0|Did not like this book,so not to be bias,my friend also did not like it.<br />read his other book and enjoyed it very much.<br />poorly written.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is an amazing app! works well, no ads. I reccomend this app to people who like Gameloft games, tycoon, or just plain fun!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This marvellous book has made me think in a totally new way! I have become a much more positive person , and I  have really learned a lot of how to understand other people.
B00DB31Y3U|5.0|I puked for 20 minutes straight after playing this.  Then my wife divorced me because I disgusted her. Then I lost my job due to excessive sobbing. play at your own risk.
B002S0KB1S|4.0|Written as he would have spoken it. Ozzy is an amazing man and should not have survived all he put himself through. Shows what can happen with some talent, drive, and a lot of luck. Humble beginnings that lead the guy to still performing in his sixties. Saw him with Black Sabbath in Sydney this year and he still has it going on....
B00DHNJCKQ|3.0|DEAD MAN DOWN's basic premise is intriguing; unfortunately, the film's creators didn't do all that they could have done with it. It would have so much better if Victor (Farrell) had found a more unexpected and innovative way to play the  Jamaicans and the Albanians off against each other. Along with said premise, the fine performances by Farrell, Noomi Rapace, Dominic Cooper, and many of the supporting cast help to redeem this film, as does the fine cinematography--some really good shots of NYC. The eclectic international soundtrack also adds something.<br /><br />There are many stretches and inconsistencies here; e.g., Beatrice's scars aren't all that horrible, and she's still quite attractive, so why is she labeled a \\"monster\\"? Though it might have killed the sex appeal, it would have been a bolder, more interesting move if her face had been horribly mangled in the auto accident, which would still not hinder the relationship she winds up sharing with Victor. {After all, they are two \\"wounded\\" people.} The way they meet via Beatrice's initial blackmail is also a little hard to buy.<br /><br />DEAD MAN DOWN should appeal decently enough to those just wanting a thriller. There are some good twists, chases, and shoot-'em-ups, but it doesn't have anywhere near the depth and suspense it might have had. While I have no big regrets about sitting through its two hours, I'm still a little disappointed.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I was expecting weather forecast and warnings. What surprised me was the maps and the videos. Have not yet found a good use for the chatter.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Of course it is a great book, but the audible option is really nice. I love to plug in at night and listen to the book. It's a nice way to unwind after a stressful day.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|I got this app in the hopes that the next version of Kindle will have a rear facing camera.Then I could use this.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Still wish the costs in cash were easier on my budget.  I enjoy playing it guide a bit.  Okay game.
B005ES0YKO|5.0|I have had several pairs of Crocs over the years~ although the sole of this particular style is a bit &#34;clunky&#34;, the support and cushion it has provided is awesome!! My Plantar Fasciitis felt better within a few days of wearing these Crocs around the house :)
B007THA4FI|2.0|I couldn't finish this book.  There wasn't one character that I really cared to find out what happened to them.  Most of the time I was very bored with the story line and would fall asleep.  I loved Harry Potter but the creativity that Rowling displayed in creating the world of Harry Potter was lacking in this story.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie is funny poignant and sweet. An all star cast of fantastic actors make for an enjoyable film. Two thumbs up.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Awesome movie about a studio that touched so many lives and produced so many hits.<br />Anyone who likes and appreciates music should watch this.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is cute funny and sweet with a good message. The second one is even more funny. Its worth the buy.
1439190275|5.0|The Atkins Diet used to be very difficult to follow, however the New Atkins for a New You is much more up to date and easier to follow!  The Atkins Cookbook really helps with great recipes that are easy and delicious!
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|It is really fun and frustrating at the same time, but I keep trying. I'm to cheep to buy the extra minutes so keep trying to getter it done on the free time. Have made it to level 27.
B00466HN6S|5.0|It got hear on time very cute movie my wife grand kids love it it's funny and hop is so cute thanks you so much
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have loved all Hosseinf's books, each one beater that the other.  I am hoping for still another book from this author Thank you
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Don't really understand this game yet.  Groom and feed, show and compete, clean the paddock...can't find the other training needed to advance.  Have done a ton of the short jumps - no more of those are adding in...
1593974744|1.0|The language is junior high cussing, and really, is a 12 year old going to save the world at this pace?  It moves very slow.  I hope the movie is better.  However I usually like a book better than a move so we'll see!
B0081336FO|5.0|Love this show and can't wait for the next season. Story lines are very good and Sherlock is played as a very intense individual that everyone loves to hate. Not that many don't have a good reason, but underneath that character is one that is fascinating.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This game is really really fun.  The only thing I don`t like is that you have to BUY tokens to play, there should be a way to WIN them as well.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|I was really disappointed in this show. I like the good guys to really be good guys. This was very gritty and made me uncomfortable. I didn't finish watching the episode because I really disliked it that much.
B0074JOCIG|4.0|I did not know Joe Bonamassa until I saw his shows on TV, and I decided to buy his DVD. Now I can tell you that this DVD is on of the best I ever had. Thank you.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Loved this version. The actors and story lines are great. I like the more British feel vs Elementary.  I like both versions, I just wish there were more episodes of this one!
B00B7VZN76|5.0|This is a must have. It looks like and sounds like it was just filmed only a month ago. Love it
1451695195|5.0|The fact that this Neursurgeon repented of his sins and got to see a glimpse of Heaven was so worth it.  Good reading material.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I am no way interested in science and technology and I had no idea who Nikola Tesla was before I started reading this book but now I am a huge fan of him and his work.<br /><br />This book has a very important message about perseverance and the magic of imagination while you get a brief history of Nikola Tesla's life - a struggling engineer.<br /><br />I have never heard of anyone who has experienced as many rejections as Tesla and sadly, he did not get the recognition that he deserved...<br /><br />What an amazing man!
B005544TRQ|5.0|This season is always moving at a fast pace and keeps the excitement going. It's clever and sharp, funny and sexy. Plus, what's not to love about Harvey Specter?
B00BKTFABE|3.0|It's not the best video app in the world but it's great if your looking for something simple and easy to use. The settings for lighting are good and load fairly quickly.So three stars I think suit it well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway suffers is a cool,fun,awesome game that is great futuristic Cartier game.<br />I can't wait to see what place we will explorer next.I have a lot of fun with this game so far .I will travel and explore with you guys every step of the way. keep up the good work and futurist imagination.<br />love always<br />Alynna
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this book has been recommended to me by everyone. now I know why. it's truly an amazing book. I was caught up in the characters from Hazel to Augustus. their love was true and genuine. this book is a great read, a tear jerker, and a cute story about two kids who fell in love.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app really it's so fun because you get to take care of a  horse that is really cool I love horses.
B004GYY714|4.0|This has made my Kindle HP even better. It comes in very clear and I seem to get a good connection anywhere.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I absolutely love everything by Rick Riordan except his cliffhangers! Every story leaves you wanting more and thinking about it almost constantly.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|I love this App! It's not easy to learn, but as you do, you love it more. For the money you can't do any better.
B00C6B7GTE|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. Nothing else needs to be said...this movie is simply a work of art.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I love Smash so much I was sad when they took it off of T.V. It is the best musical I ever saw on t.v .
B00B78AIV0|5.0|An intelligent well-written story. This was my first book I've read by this young author. I was intrigued by her TED talk. I've downloaded her other work and anxiously anticipate reading them. She mentioned other African writers in her TED talk; she opened new avenues of beautiful writing to me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you like the Xbox edition then you will love this game I would recommend this game to everyone so if you're a guy that doesn't like minecraft your not a guy.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I liked it a lot. the characters are good, if the story gets a little soap opera ish.  Eager for season 3 to be available to Prime members for no cost.
1451695195|4.0|Fascinating journey into the beyond, resulting in an educated non-believer becoming a dedicated believer committed to passing on his new knowledge that Heaven exists. The only thing I did not like was the end of the book where recommendations were made for specific meditation techniques, including Hemi-Sync, that sounded like a promotion to guide the reader to sign up. The attempt to connect with physics, specifically quantum mechanics, was appreciated but lacked depth, I thought. I would rather have wished the book be left for what it is, a near death experience that was powerful and life changing with the reader treated to a glimpse of it and allowed to rate it for himself or herself.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kids have so much fun with this app. They have been playing it as much as they are allowed to.  Even my three year old is learning how to play it.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I like it because I do okay by bye bye lol haha nice =)!!!  Okay peace out duces stay classy and a little bit sassy
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Good music to drive to.First heard Fun in a commercial sining &#34;We Are Young&#34; and since then I was hooked on them.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|This is a delightful film for the whole family to experience together. The story is timeless and always applies to our life.
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|\\"A Good Day to Die Hard,\\" the 5th - and least - installment in the series that began in 1988, finds John McClane (Bruce Willis) in Russia trying to rescue his son (not Edward Snowden, in case you were wondering) from prison. Turns out, unbeknownst to the elder McClane, Junior (Jai Courtney), who's apparently more of a chip off the old block than dad ever imagined, is actually an undercover agent for the C.I.A., foiling terrorist plots seemingly on a daily basis.<br /><br />Papa McClane isn't there five minutes before he's turned the streets of Moscow into a veritable demolition derby - honestly, Godzilla didn't wreak this kind of havoc on Tokyo even on his worst day - and the movie itself into a smoldering ruin.<br /><br />In the screenplay by Skip Woods, nothing less than the fate of the free world hangs in the balance, while Junior works out his daddy issues amid a hail of bullets and a fusillade of explosions.  The quips and wisecracks and \\"you weren't there for me when I was growing up\\" whining pall early on, and all we're left with in the final analysis is a bunch of scowling Russians and the wholesale destruction of everything animate and inanimate unfortunate enough to wind up in the McClanes' path.<br /><br />I can't imagine that Russia will be renewing either one of their visas anytime soon.
0425263924|5.0|Loved every second of it! Waiting for the 4th book..<br />Does someone know when will that be?<br />Let me know..

0143142364|1.0|I returned this product because it is abridged. I can't think of any reason to produce an abridged version of this item. And the only available is abridged. To get unabridged you need to use audible.com. Bummer.
014241543X|5.0|This book will stir your emotions and will make you cry a bucket of tears.<br /><br />Gayle Forman precisely know what will make the heart of her readers weep in a lot of imaginable ways.<br />If I stay was beautiful written,the characters are very well developed, & the plot was moving.
B00B2TE7FC|4.0|This is a great first album. First saw them on you tube and fell in love with them on the spot. Wish they had more covers on this cd though. Great band that gives off a great vibe!
1250007208|5.0|Wow. Where to begin?<br /><br />WHY DIDN'T I READ THIS BOOK SOONER?<br /><br />As a writer I think it's important you craft your characters and the world they live in thoroughly and Marissa Meyer perfectly created her masterful novel.<br /><br />I found myself completely flabbergasted and lost in the world of Cinder. Everything about this book breathe raw emotions, the flawless writing, breath-taking cover, the genre which I normally don't go for. With every page, I am falling more in love with everyone. I just want to give Cinder a proper cuddle because she definitely need one, to give Emperor Kai my supportive pat in his shoulder, to cry at Peony's unfortunate death and to forever treasure Iko's rabid fangirling.<br />I make no secret that I'll be putting this book in my 2012 favorites and Scarlet as one of my most highly anticipating book next year.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It is a charming movie , filled with magic and adventure.  It's a bit greedy to makea three movies out of the shortest of the ring stories.
0142419400|4.0|I did want to shake some senses into certain characters at times, but it's not a big deal.<br />Nonetheless its a cute read that perhaps will whisk you away to Paris.

0385736002|1.0|I've been dying to get my hands in this book for a very long time.<br />And after reading six chapters, I couldn't help but to feel a huge pang of disappointment.<br />No matter how much I tried to get on with the plot of the story, I just couldn't grasp it thus making me put it down.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|I love Doodle jump! I got the free one but it isn't as good as the updated one this one is really worth ur money it is so fun and addicting! :{)
B006LSZECO|2.0|Are you kidding me???  I cannot believe I read this entire book to reach such an unbelievably maddening conclusion...  What was the point?
B00D8RYV52|4.0|Great game , Daughter loves all these games and I never have to worry the content She would play them for hours if we let her.
B006Y9BVRM|4.0|Just got it the other day. Showed up early, bonus! Only reason for 4 stars is I'm not crazy about the band and will probably replace it soon.  But absolutely love the heft, feel and looks of this watch.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It works wonderfully on my 1st Generation Kindle. I am satisfied. It opens pdf files with no problem and I would recommend it to others.
B009WUBERW|3.0|If you saw the first one I'd say this is pretty similar. Worth watching. Prob won't be as good on TV eventually.<br /><br />Glad I watched it. May not ever watch again though.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I loved this book and highly recommend it... I have gone out of my way to read several additional books on native American History and the ruthless genocide exercised by our national leaders who are revered by many Americans that don't understand what happened to a proud nation of tribes that originally roamed and owned our nation. I think what happened to them is an absolute disgrace to our American History.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini is an engaging storyteller who offers us in the Western world a peek into a culture that most of us know only by representation by the mass media. His characters and their stories come alive, under the skillful strokes of his pen.  My only criticism is a bit of disjointedness in time, place, and voice.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|The solution of the mystery crime was rather contrived, but reading about Norway's political involvement in World War II and its present relationship to Nazism was an eye-opener for me. I especially liked the non-linear way the plot evolved. I would suggest this book as a good summer read.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|An amazing Sci Fi, humanity at its best, story and I will definitely add it to my favorite movie collection.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Good read about  challenges we face as humans and how one woman dealt with hers. The author accomplished what most of us would never dream of through her stubborn resolve and  courage.
B009R659L8|5.0|I have just started reading her books and think she portrays her characters well and lays out her plot very well. I will read more of her work.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Very good but heartbreaking.Would definitely recommend. Makes me grateful for the life I have.we don't appreciate how lucky we are.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|I downloaded this mostly for my almost-4-year-old animal-loving daughter. She couldn't make it through the entire plot (too long and intricate) but I enjoyed the movie. The relationship between the bird &#34;Blue&#34; and owner is one that has been played out in our household with other species. :) There are, as in most animated movies, some pop-culture references and other elements included for the entertainment of the adult folk watching. All in all, good and entertaining. Just a little too involved for my little one at this point.
B00821OX98|3.0|This show is ok.<br /><br />Some of the plot holes are pretty big and most of the cast are boring chars.<br /><br />But as the title says, its better than nothing.<br /><br />Wouldn't buy it or pay to see it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is very fun and very addictive. Been playing for a long time and it is very hard to put down
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of my favorite shows. I love the characters but I am sad about certain losses this season. Wish it could of ended differently
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I just started reading this book today and don't want to put it down!  Total eye opening!  Empowering! Must read!
0857208748|5.0|Great as always, Fabulous book, so sorry  to hear Vince  Flynn passing, Love his Books. I will probably read his new books just released this year very soon
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Nice game play mixed with the adorable minions. I haven't had the app long but it's addicting. It's very cute.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! The different translations are great. Sometimes I read a scripture and to get a better understanding I'll simply change to a different version. This Bible app gives you several versions for free. I would recommend this app to everyone over other similar apps I have tried.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|...South Africa through his music.  It is my favorite documentary and the music is fantastic.  It is a must see!<br /><br />Please enjoy,
B00132D808|4.0|Panic At The Disco is not a band that I would think I would like. I had heard a hit single they had and it sounded very similar to other pop-punk-ish stuff I had heard before (and their similarities to Fall Out Boy were a bit strange).<br /><br />I'm a classic rock guy, with the Beatles being my favorite band of all time. How pleasantly surprised I was to listen to this album and hear quite a few throwbacks to the Fab Four. It's not perfect, but the songwriting is creative and refreshing enough for those of us who long for what we consider the good ol' days of music.
1609611543|5.0|This is a very interesting book.  My husband has already lost a lot of weight following the instructions in a short time.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|I enjoyed the movie whether it's silly or not.  Isn't that why we watch some movies to escape from reality sometimes.
B008K8U13K|2.0|I downloaded this for my Grandson, it took for ever to download. I didn't know it was a movie. we canceled it because it was taking to long to download.
B000VIK8D0|4.0|This is a great movie about one of the great lawmen of the 19th century.  No it's not a comedy, and Hollywood souped it up a little, but it is close to reality.<br /><br />If you want to have comments, don't require a specific amount of words!
B000HZGNH2|4.0|Other than by just drooling over josh Lucas, this movie has always been able gold my attention with its fast paced, action packed plot.
B001KZG99A|4.0|I enjoyed the movie whether it's silly or not.  Isn't that why we watch some movies to escape from reality sometimes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent series.  love the way the servants lives have just as much drama as the family and how they are entertwined.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What I love about this show is at the end of the 45 mins of an episode I feel like I actually watched something. It is a well written show and I look forward to the next season.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Overall, the gameplay is very weak. For the most part it will require a fair amount of somewhat random tapping to solve the hidden object puzzles. There is little guidance, and plenty of solutions can't really be discovered with logic. For example, you may find a magical staff to use in a puzzle, but not know what it does or when to use it.<br /><br />If you are only interested in this app for the gaming element you will almost certainly grow bored of it before finishing the game. Fortunately, the story element is a bit stronger than the gameplay, so if you take time to read the dialogue or listen to the full-script voiceovers you might stick with it long enough to finish. Its &quot;OK&quot;, but unless you've already played all of the best this genre has to offer, there's plenty of similar titles that are far more entertaining.
0345803493|5.0|The best books i have read in a long time!!!  I have all 3 books now and I am going to read them gain!  Kudos to E L James!!!!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The book is great, however, a little short. There are 6 or more books in the series, Morgan Rice should have made two or three of the books into one. It's a money making scheme, even though the books are cheap.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|App is ok for being free. It's nice for on the go stuff, but not for checkbook balancing. that's all.
B000JQU4TW|4.0|Really well written, an incredibly brilliant and imaginative idea. Get the book, you won't be disappointed. Dorian Gray is a character that develops, and gives the reader a portrait of his life.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|The Heavy is a strange and spectacular band.  Blending funk, rock, blues, and many other genres, they've come up with a sound that is uniquely their own.  If you've only heard their more popular singles like &#34;How You Like Me Now?&#34; and &#34;Short Change Hero&#34; this is a great place to start, since this is the album that has both.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Just as the title States it's a good book but it's not great. I've heard of the book World War Z from numerous people over the years and I decided to read it but I wasn't I rlly impressed by it, it's merely a collection of zombie stories with an outlined theme.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It's so great that the tech. Is here to bring back my childhood comics in real life . Plot can suck but I will watch them anyway. This plot did not suck. These actors looked like they had fun making this movie.
0439023513|4.0|I was given the1st book in the trilogy as a gift. I bought the 2nd book, and this book ,3rd book, based on Amazon's price, and reviews in Library Journal. My library system Cleveland Public Library, CPL.ORG bought 27 copies of each book.  There is a waiting list for all 3 of the books in my library. I'd rather buy the books and re-gift them later than wait for my library to loan me copy.
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|Not as good as Arnold's but for a remake I say see it and judge for yourself . Plot needed some work and Conan needs to be more bloodthirsty with a little bit of kindness .

B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|I movie to be watch every year! Rob Reiner fantastic direction. The actors were all great. For all those who loved their childhood.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|This is a must have cookbook for anyone who loves vegetables. I love the pictures of every recipe. Simple and beautiful to look at, the recipes taste just as good! Wish I could have eaten at his new restaurant while in London, but couldn't fit it into our schedule!<br />Next time!!
B00DH1G7DS|1.0|You must be logged into the Amazon appstore in order to use this app.  Just how one is supposed to do this when outside a wireless network is a mystery to me, but being able to run your app outside a WiFi signal seems like it should be BASIC FREAKING FUNCTIONALITY for a simple Sudoku game on a portable device!  Furthermore, this restriction is not disclosed in the description before you buy it!  So, you don't get to do your sudoku puzzle without checking in with the store where you bought it, and they don't tell you that before you buy it.  You're not really getting what they say you're getting... classic bait &amp; switch.  Avoid.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I thought Infinity on High was awesome until I got my hands on this CD.  If you like Fall Out Boy don't hesitate to buy this.  You will not be disappointed.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|TRUST ME NOT EVEN FREE COULD HELP IT. Gets lost and talks with british accent. Very confused on how they even get by giving this away.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Game is simple to learn and keeps you entertained for a good while. Great for long trips or doctor's waiting rooms.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|A lot of fun I would recommend this game to anyone. A good way to kill time on the road or during some down time.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I use the actual website on my laptop more often than the one on my Kindle Fire HD, but it still gets the job done. I haven't purchased anything yet with this app, but it makes selling items simple.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked his last two books a whole lot more.  This is a good book, but his last two books were very good books!!  I would have liked a nicer ending to the story, it could have gone a better way.  I wanted to be able to sit down in the last chapter with a box of tissues, but it was not to happen.  Still, it was a very enjoyable read.....
B0083Z614S|5.0|The Secret Garden is very well written and captivates you from the beginning. Characters almost seem to come to life and has exciting moments in it. I would recommend reading this over watching the movie. Please, don't watch the movie before reading this.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The ap used to be awesome.  I don't like the upgrade.  It is now childish and rediculous.  It is not User friendly anymore.  I am deleting it from all of the devices it is on.  It went from being an ap I used daily to a deleted ap with that upgrade.  I was looking at the reviews and noticed that the dates on the positive reviews were older before the change.  DISLIKE!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|watched all three season within 30 days, could not stop watching it. Cannot wait till the season begins, even watching the recaps.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have never heard of nor watched this series ( I do not watch much television )  On a whim I thought I would watch one show an am hooked - It is very entertaining
B006GWO5NE|3.0|my kindle still won't hold a charge, it runs down in about 6 hours, We had hoped that this would solve my problem, but it did not.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Decent story and kept me interesting throughout.  I would recommend it as a rental or stream it live on Amazon.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Fun. Easy to play. I'm sure I will soon be addicted! Love the graphics and how it lets you know if you are heading in the correct direction!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Excellent game.  Worked well on my KFHD 7&#34;.  Beautiful creepy graphics and well thought out story.  I finished it in about 4 1/2 hrs of gameplay.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|I had heard that this was a very scary movie, so I really wanted to see it. I didn't find it that scary though. If you're really into blood and gore this is the movie for you. The special effects are really well done. All in all, not a bad movie, just not that scary
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I love the layout of this game and how it highlights the numbers already placed for you.  Well done. .
B00E193Y36|5.0|This is a must buy album for FFDP!!  Listened to it about 20 times through and love it every time.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|You know those times when your friends are draped over your furniture and you're all pretty much too high to think up conversation?  Never suffer through that again with the help of Akinator!  Your friends will be giggling in no time, and chicks dig funny.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Really loving JT's new album, would definitely recommend! Reasonable price and it was instantly available to listen to. Loved it!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Because you will want to buy the full game.  Another excellent HO offering from Big Fish, and pretty creepy.  Worked well on my KFHD
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Its a great movie at many levels. The plot is complex, but not too complex. The twist and ending are perfect, its an enjoyable movie for anyone.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is addictive; I have played it everyday since I downloaded it. It's has beautiful graphics and super fast game play.
B001DHXT2A|4.0|The dvd's were in very good condition. It plays very well. For any Hulk fans, this is a must own!
B00B2FDF54|5.0|This movie is one that can be watched many times over and over again.  Funny serious and a great story.  Clint Eastwood is always great.  Another winner for him
6305161976|4.0|The dvd was in very good condition. Plays very well. For any classical movie fan, this is a must own!
1608871452|5.0|the best thing of the book is the tons of pictures and stickers included. excellent option .. my daughter loves it
B00005JPS8|4.0|The dvd's were in very good condition. Plays very well. For any Iron Man fan, this is a must own!
B002JXK5VU|3.0|Somewhat enjoyable, but not too realistic. Fun for a quick look.  Premise is an unusual town with very strange inhabitants.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|I enjoy this movie a lot and the humor just gets better and better the more I watch it. Definitely worth it!
B008NEMPTO|5.0|very exciting movie. the characters were interesting and I had a friend who actually acted as a vampire. he runs toward the camera during the battle of Gettysburg.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I have been playing this game for about 3 years now and it is not for the faint of heart. Never won top 500 on the tournament, never mind top 250, which is what one needs to achieve to complete it. Very difficult to complete collections, have to have many friends to collect good rewards. Even when one pays double for a second shot at a collection item, that is no guarantee you will get it. If you want to be discouraged, play this game.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Works as advertised it cleaned alot of junk of my Kindle Fire.  I haven't tried its more advanced features yet but i would recommend it to others.
1451627289|5.0|Never thought I'd say this, never been a big fan of Stephen King, liked him a bit sure, in jest really, but I never put him up there with the likes of Hitchcock, or Rod Serling.  Always been a lover of time travel, Somewhere in Time, It's A Wonderful Life, two of my favorite films, but now after reading Stephen King's novel, 11-22-63, I place him firmly in their company.<br /><br />One thing that's really great about 11/22/63 is how perfectly King utilizes the lexicon and mannerisms of the era that you truly feel you are there, with all the awkwardness of one carrying luggage for a summer trip in a snow filled winter resort! All the information from his own time is no help to him here, so it is as if he knows nothing... or very little... and that comes across beautifully.<br /><br />Okay, I have to add more to my thoughts on 11/22/63 now.  Initially, all I knew was it was about wanting to change an infamous day in history that rocked a nation to its core, changing its worldview forever, the 9/11 of its day, the assassination of JFK, of MLK, of Hitler's rise to power, these fixed points in history are indelibly scarred into our memory, perhaps into our very DNA, into the way we will evolve as a species.<br /><br />But it's more than that.  We have to understand the impetus that important emotional factor that makes one not just want to change an infamous event, but do so at all costs, what sparks the heart so deeply that it would risk everything for it?  It must be deeply personal, it cannot just be an act we all remember, it must be we one we all FEEL in our bones... and thus, King creates that impetus, and that context, with the family, their fragility, their simple humanity...<br /><br />And in this way we want to help them avoid their dark ending... we want to save those Titanic passengers not because it was a tragedy of strangers, but in real people we feel in our hearts, in a visceral way, the loss is our own, and this is what gives our hero the necessary and vital inspiration to commit to creating change at any cost, and why we then can relate to the story being told.<br /><br />Surprisingly, my heart goes out to Sadie, in the book 11-22-63, the novel by Stephen King concerning time travel, JFK and the already well-explored cautionary butterfly effect , but none at such depth as this. The main character is kind of a fool, sometimes I want to yell at him for his lack of empathy, and the unnecessary suffering it creates, but mostly, the contrast and disparity creates a very tense space within which one contemplates the dark issues raised by the story, wandering a dark and narrow path, like skirting a craggy precipice, and always looking down.<br /><br />I think 11-22-63 is worth reading.<br /><br />Having gotten through the thick of the love story and the stalking of the Oswalds I have to say it wasn't as thick, long or tedious as the negative reviews made it out to be, at least to me. In fact, while some of it was a bit drowning in details, we had to feel what 5 years means, that he had come under the spell of the times, that he didn't want to leave, he'd created a life there, full of nuance and detail, he'd created attachments... meaningful relationship... but out of all the people in the book, I cared more for Sadie than anyone else.<br /><br />It is VERY compelling, and I never stopped hoping for Sadie, and pondering on the times... I felt... like I was there.<br /><br />Spoiler:  I don't agree with Stephen King's conclusion about JFK's assassination, that Oswald did it alone purely on the grounds of paranoia, it's possible sure, but all evidence of what JFK was doing, passing bills to reduce the power of the Fed, his issues with Cuba, all of these issues are not raised by the book one wit, and that surprised me... but King also pounds in another idea quite often in the book, an acronym, KISS... keep it simple stupid... and he does this with his plot, and his character's modus operandi.  For good and bad.  It's a workof fiction, and it works here, no reason not to write it this way, why not?  It's a speculative work of fiction, I accept that, and I enjoyed it on its terms.<br /><br />I've read a few reviews stating that it's ridiculous, now spoiler here coming, that two women Jake knows in the book wind up with large scars on their faces at different points in the story... but actually if you're following along it's not ridiculous at all... we know that the past is obdurate, it's repeated many times to get this point across, so if damage is averted in one place, it's found manifested in another... this is how in one timeline one woman has the scar, and in another, it's Sadie... the past harmonizes, it finds a way to manifest, you can't really change anything, not really... and in this way, the book is quite beautiful and intelligent and profoundly intuitive.  The past harmonizes, it's obdurate, what manifests in time, must manifest in time, one way or another.<br /><br />In this way the past is a bit like an earthquake.  Tectonic plates building up tension, awaiting an earthquake, and the longer it waits the worse it gets, meaning, if you stop something from happening in the past, the tension for its inevitable outcome grows until it manifests much much more powerfully.<br /><br />I've been reading and watching King since I was little in the '70s as well. Before him I would sit in the library with huge tomes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and I always loved King's works, but more for fun, never with the depth of Hitchcock until 11-22-63, in all honesty. 11-22-63 imho, is the single greatest work by King I've ever read.
B0006LZPLC|5.0|I've had another pair of thee for about 8 years. I've hiked in them rock hopped up creeks and abused them regularly. They've held up perfectly. I just bought this second pair b/c I wanted a pair that wasn't thrashed to wear to work. These are great. Highly recommended
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This is one of the few movies where it is very close to the exact story line from the book.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This is the greatest blu-ray set ever!  great display and fun to use.  Great for a Walking Dead Fan!!!!!! A must have.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This app is not what people say it is.  They do not get back to you if you are having difficulties.  I have tried to reach them and they just ignore you.  Sorry, we cannot help at this time
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book made me want to drop everything and finally hike the Pacific Crest trail.<br />Cheryl does a great job of conveying all that a long hike like this has to offer. From the long stretches of personal reflection to the physical torture the trail can inflict.<br /><br />I know this review doesn't do the book justice, but I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good adventure, or has reached a personal crossroad that has left them feeling lost.
B004BDDJN2|5.0|I love this movie especially when it's Zac playing the main role. He's a great actor, and a great person. I love watching zappy love movies; sometimes I can relate to them. I give him two thumbs up! Excellent work, Zachary !
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I enjoy the Dr Who stories.The writers have done a very good job with the characters and story arcs.<br />Special effects are great.<br />I would recommend to all Who fans.  :)
B00720T26E|5.0|The book is amazing! The tales were written for little witches and wizards, but little muggles should read it too!<br />It helps build respect for what we think it is different.<br />I did feel like I was reading something really special, something that can last a lot.<br />I do recommend.<br />JK rocks!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I couldn't stop watching after the first episode.  I had to see what the next  episode was going to offer.
B00CWVFZ8W|5.0|Love th special effects and the story line... Which is different from all the other supernatural movies out there, minimal by the way
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Wish that more was in the series, but when it over there can't be anymore. Rest in peace Peter Faulk.
1844486524|5.0|I borrowed this from the library and ordered my own copy ten minutes after opening it at home. This is a fabulous resource for all kinds of trims - cords.  Translates well to jewelry weaving. Love - love it.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|The film itself I loved, honestly not on par with episodes like A Canterlot Wedding or Magical Mystery Cure, but a very enjoyable experience nonetheless.<br /><br />However, the extra features were, decent. There was a short behind the scenes look at it, a few bits of information were interesting, I always enjoyed seeing how the movie I watched was made. The Ponify Yourself was very odd, its just a few girls putting on makeup similar to the makeup on the hideous vectors seen on merchandise, not the vectors seen in the actual movie, the vectors that made us think this movie was going to be awful. This entire sequence was strange and out of place, I expected a pony OC creator or a human creator that would allow you to make versions of yourself in the same animation style as the movie, but oh well. The karaoke songs were fun, seeing how I loved both of the songs that were used. The printable poster was a bit of a letdown, I expected something unique with all of the characters on it or something, but all I got was the movie poster used at theaters. You know I could've just printed out that exact image from Google, right Hasbro?<br /><br />But overall, I am a satisfied buyer and want the writer of the film, Meghan McCarthy, to sign it so badly the next time I can see her at a convention!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|A well done look at the impact on Downton Abbey of post WWI events.  The ability of the various characters to adapt to the changing world is somewhat predictable, but entertaining nonetheless.
B008602KQI|5.0|UN Agenda 21 wrapped in a Hollywood package.  Woody Harrelson was extremely good.  Wonder how far fetched it really is.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I (29) and my daughter (10) loved playing together on this game! We were both challenged but not too hard. We are excited for more levels so we can play again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just loved this season.  The charaCTers are amazing, I love mr. bates back, but I cried so when we lost Cybil......keep it up!
B001O22ELQ|5.0|My son suggested this movie and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. A sweet movie with well written song lyrics. Neil Patrick Harris never ceases to amaze me with his talent.
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|I don't usually like &#34;single&#34; edits of songs, but this one is definitely an exception. Check it out! Well worth the money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very addicting, low pressure fun, easy enough but not boring, takes just about the right amount of time to get through a level while you're waiting for something. Cool
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Read during recent trip to Australia and is utterly fascinating take on Aussie's country and their history. The way people bump into incredible discoveries of creatures, minerals and places is caught beautifully by Bryson. Read it!
B002XWXPC8|5.0|Classic comedy with very funny characters. They dont make them like this anymore unfortunately. The first one is the best of the three.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This is a wonderful ensemble piece with a clutch of total professionals having a whole bunch of fun doing this film. It makes it worth watching.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|preview looked so good, watched movie and i was lost through it and didnt understand it all. i wouldnt rec it to anyone
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Difficult to put down. Anxious to read book two.<br />Story good for adults or young adults to read.

B005IQZB14|5.0|This was recommended to me and now I have recommended it to all of my friends.  Cheryl Strayed really knows how to tell a story.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I know a lot of people who have read this book and I decided to follow their lead. Completely worth it. Tina Fey is laugh-out-loud funny (actually it's more like laughing loudly in public places kind of funny) and her perspective on the world is unique and entertaining.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I must admit that I had to fast forward through the rape scene and the revenge scene. Otherwise, I found this is a darkly fascinating story of a young computer whiz who helps a man solve a serial murder case that has dragged on for decades in Sweden.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mine craft is so cool with the new updates lava that was so cool so if u like mine craft get this one
B00AKO93JK|1.0|I have the other daily workout apps. so, when I saw this one, I thought I would be able to make a customized workout using exercises from all the different apps. no, you cannot. unlessbi am too dumb to figure it out... that was the only reason that I bought this app, and it was a waste of money. I am vvlery disappointed.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game is amazing, it's fun and at the same time challenging. You can choose your difficulty and use what you earn in a level to buy stuff for another level.<br /><br />You should buy this game, it's worth It.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The book is great!! Kept me reading for hours. The ending I was waiting for more but didn't get what I was looking for. Maybe in the next book! Overall, book kept me  on your toes and my mind blown away!!! Starting book two soon!!!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Unbelievable! First class rock/blues like back in the '70's! My kind of music ! Not the digital creations with computer's & no musician's. Pure & personal guitar with the artist's talent & skill, along with the passion & expertise you expect from an icon like Joe Walsh! I'm crazy about it & have shared it with others who share my sentiments. Phenominal....
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is an excellent series of books.  It is an enjoyable story line as long as you don't worry about some of the technical aspects.  It is another one of the many end of the world stories.  It blames man for the destruction of man and paints the U.S. as the ultimate villain in the destruction of civilization as we know it.  I am not sure if that was the authors intention as it doesn't seem to be the point of the story.  In attempting to &#34;save&#34; humanity we destroy it.  Similar to other stories I have read.  I think the tv show &#34;revolution,&#34; may have stolen the idea for the &#34;silo&#34; from these books.  Overall it was a good read and you will enjoy it.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|fabulous - my 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 yr old grandchildren loved it. The size, the slide and the sprinklers all around are so darling. would definitely recommend to anyone.  Takes a bit of time to hand/foot pump since it is not recommended to use an electric one. Great value for the price also.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|updates are being applied to other devices but the kindle fire is forgotten... I have found that it costs more to play and my game constantly stutters or locks up. I play on my phone with wifi and it works just fine.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|More elaborate than the original but just as satisfying. New music but a familiar environment, with plenty of new moves.
0399255370|5.0|~ borrowed from the Library  THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT is a wonderful picture book.  It makes for a good Read-aloud and my older children have enjoyed reading it for themselves.  The story is about kid art, and the children I've read this book to (and with) have really enjoyed the complaints of the crayons.  Some crayons, you see, feel underused, while others are exhausted because they are so popular.  And children can relate this to how they use colors in their artwork.  (Are all their suns yellow or orange?  All their bears dark brown?)  The humor is delivered in the form of letters from the crayons.  They write in their own color, of course, and they write in their own font.  And it's this latter part that is going to keep most younger readers from being able to read it themselves.  It's a great book to use to make children think about how they draw, and what stereotypes are involved.  Do they, for example, think of pink as a 'girlie' color?  Read it and enjoy. Great fun.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|A bit over the top, but a good story line. Get the POP CORN going, and fill the cooler with cold drinks, sit and enjoy
B005544TRQ|5.0|I resisted watching this thinking it would be like every other workplace drama. Boy, was I mistaken! I was hooked from the 1st episode
B000002UJQ|5.0|For humans that feel you can't do much better than Radiohead. Ok Computer being their masterpiece, but one album before and three after are also very strong.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  As good as Hosseini's other books.  A story of love and heart break.  I would highly recommend it.
0060935464|5.0|A classic everyone should read. Well written, but sadly it accurately depicts the times. Growing up in a white southern culture, this book brings back a lot of haunting memories.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best running game ever! It's better than subway surfer, temple run, temple run'2. And any other game.you can think of
0143124544|4.0|I really enjoyed this book despite the fact that I cried from about half-way through to the end.  The author hides nothing - you know what is going to happen even if the characters don't. The reader isn't really allowed to hope for a different ending, but you don't want to stop reading.  You love certain characters and hate others, and they remind you of real flawed people in your real life.<br /><br />I would not, however, call this a romance.  It is much more about a powerful friendship than romance or romantic love.  And that is not just because there is no physical love.  It's partially because you KNOW what's going to happen and KNOW this isn't going to have a fairy tale ending.<br /><br />It was beautiful, and despite the fact that my eyes are still swollen the day after finishing it, I really loved it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The season was great. There were some twists that I didn't see coming. Didn't love the ending, but you can't have everything.
B00003TL18|5.0|In all honesty we were at a friend's home and they played this video and we all were mesmerized through the whole thing.  Some of the musician's that sang and played with him on this were Stars in their on rights!  The music is awesome and well-worth listening too. There was KD Lang and Bonnie Raitt as some of the backup singers.  Then there was Bruce Springstein, Elvis Costello and many many more throughout the &#34;concert.&#34;  I'm so glad I got this.  Now I can play this in my car, and I'm seriously thinking of buying the video too.  If you loved Roy Orbison's music, then you'll love this CD, and may even want to get the DVD too.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Sorry I didn't buy this movie and I pay is and mom didn't know about the movie<br />Thank Debra Wirtz Schwingle
1451627297|4.0|I have held a grudging respect for Stephen King for many years. I respect his dedication, commitment and obsession with writing what he loves for several decades. He has a gift for writing a kind of fiction that is relentlessly involving, addictive and popular. Yet there is something in his approach, his style, his tendency to indulge in an almost fetishistic relish with the gruesome and the terrifying and polish those effects with a gaudiness that charms readers and blinds them to his weaknesses and limitations.<br /><br />Many of his novels have not interested me enough to devote the sizable time required to read them as most of them are doorstop-sized. However, by tackling the JFK assassination, a real historic event with seismic consequences, I knew that he wasn't just dealing with the horrors of private Maine citizens but with a national tragedy with major ramifications. Dealing with real people and events, he had to get his facts straight or he would be called on it immediately and his premise would lose all credibility.<br /><br />To my pleasant surprise he succeeds in many respects in conveying a sense of the real world of the late 50's and early 60's and the climate of the country in the days leading up to November 22, 1963. The premise of time travel and changing history is hardly new and yet it possesses an attention-grabbing quality. Who of us has never contemplated changing something from our past or rewriting history in either trivial or significant ways? He wisely doesn't waste any time on a scientific explanation for time travel. That would be irrelevant to the purpose of his tale. The use of the `butterfly effect' is intriguing, especially as it applies to the Kennedy assassination. However, time traveler Jake Epping lands in 1958 and has some dragons to kill and some wrongs to right before he can even contemplate something as major as the killing of Kennedy. While the premise of a 2011 man thrust into the world of 1958 is interesting, there are toomany standard psychopaths standing in the way of Jake's journey to the watershed moment.<br /><br />King has a tendency to drive home a point ad nauseum. After three uses of the phrase `life turns on a dime' he wisely gives up on that cliché. However, he uses the term `obdurate' in describing the past what seems like a hundred times over the course of an 800-page novel. If I were reading the Kindle version I could search the term and arrive at the exact number of instances. Two or three would be sufficient; I get it. His repeated use of the term obscures the fact that his approach to time travel and how each trip back creates a new thread and how these threads get tangled with each other is actually quite compelling.<br /><br />Ultimately, however, I think the concept overwhelms the characters, most of which don't transcend cliché. The disturbed loner psychopaths such as Frank Dunning, John Clayton and Lee Oswald are really not that different from each other. Likewise, the protagonists largely stay within predetermined fictional types.<br /><br />Where King's time travel saga is more involving than Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee in medieval England or H.G. Wells' time traveler in a distant alien London several hundred years in the future is in sending his protagonist back only fifty years. Many of his readers, including this one, were alive fifty years ago and have at least some recollection of what life in America was like at that time. It is close enough to imagine living in that time and yet so far removed in some ways as to require major adjustments. Once Jake gets used to the 50's and 60's he's happy there for a while.<br /><br />The master of horror is still dealing with horrors. Only this time, some have just been supplied by American history itself. These are the horrors of disturbed homicidal psychopaths lurking within placid suburban exteriors as well as the even more forbidding, ominous and overwhelming presence of the obdurate past. `The past' is anentity in this novel, just as King has written of fogs, vampires, cars and other terrifying forces. The past of 11/22/63 is obdurate and resists efforts to change it and creates yet more threads over which time travelers such as Jake Epping will stumble and create wider and more numerous ripples. Yet despite all the obstacles standing in its way, love survives and emerges triumphant.

1567184855|5.0|I found it very thought provoking and information I had not thought about before. Everyone should read this just to get more information to base their opinions on. I recommend it.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I love the series so much, I was happy to get another in my collection.  It came in good condition, Thanks
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I haven't read the entire book. I have read over 100 pages and just can't get into it. I know lots of people that LOVE this book but if I'm not hooked within the first 100 pages, I put it down.. But from what I did read, the main female character is beyond naive and I don't think this situation she runs into is realistic.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|Loved the Tokyo Tapes thirty years ago love them still. Digitally remastered has extremely improved the listening experience.Sound clarity is extradordinary.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Not what I was expecting, however I am enjoying playing this game. It's pretty easy to play and I like how it mixes it up when you don't have another move.
B005721Y7Y|4.0|Good &#34;noir genre&#34; film.  Kevin Spacey is always fun to watch.  I recommend that you watch this movie if you like quirky movies.
B008OE05IG|5.0|Lovely film about hard work and family and good food and the declining seas and the mission of one ultimate control freak.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Kite runner was okay, the next book better and this one outstanding.I truly enjoyed reading it. It brought out a lot of emotions. very  very very good read
0064471837|4.0|This trilogy is a wonderful example of world building even though it takes a little effort to get into it. I spent 3 days reading the first 10 pages then I read all 3 books in the next 3 days. They are addicting. The heroine of this book is a great contrast to the typical young adult male heroes. The lore created for the bells and the history of the world are intriguing and I can't wait for the prequel when it finally comes out.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Prior to watching this movie, I knew nothing about Katy Perry, and ended up really enjoying this movie and liking her as a person.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A friend of mine mentioned that she was disappointed that she wasn't able to view season three of the show since it left Hulu.  To console her, I sent her the CD's as a surprise.  While we were talking in the airport, I quickly ordered it online and had it shipped to her within minutes.  The video's were waiting for her when she returned from our trip, about a week later.  The process of ordering through delivery could not have been easier.  Her devotion to this show got me curious though, and I started watching it on Amazon Prime when I got back.  So happy all three seasons were available!  I watched from beginning to end in a very short time - great, great show!  Love Amazon prime...
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|A really fun show that doesn't require too much brain power but is very entertaining. Very easy watching and would recommend
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea Bocelli never disappoints.  This CD is very romantic and I like the fact that there is variety in this CD.  The songs are all very well chosen and his romantic voice just relaxes you.  This a CD that I am constantly playing.  I highly recommend.
B009UNH0EM|4.0|Glad the cable was good and cheap, I just wish it was a little longer. Besides that it's a great product.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love Brits shows and this one is one of my favorite. Watch it on PBS and now can see it any time on prime. Love it
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Wasn't the whole premise of the original supposed to be a dream-like state after a konk on the head?  Why was this made?
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, the characters are a bit on the chatty side and can be bothersome sometimes,but the graphics are great and the mini games were a welcome addition...This is my first Nevosoft game on my android device ,based solely on this experience,I will be seeking out more of their titles.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I admire this woman so much because she beat and addiction by doing something so hard that her toe nails even felt the challenge of her overcoming.  Her negative worldly ways were destroyed in her almost spiritual quest to find her true self and true worth.  She replaces losses with finds that change her life permanently for the better. Hiking over 1000 miles on the Pacific Rim Trail is what it took for Cheryl to overcome.  Our book group is going to take a hike and explore what we need to overcome when we discuss this book.  Thank you Cheryl for showing you had what it takes to have victory in your life.

B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This is a very fun game and far too addicting for this former Tetris queen.  Be careful, it will suck you in.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|Has plenty of extra features which I like,and movie is also very well paced. All around good entertainment! Good job!!!!
B00BHF9SHS|5.0|This is her best album ever. Start to finish it's good. You won't find a song you feel like skipping on the whole cd.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|This book, this story will shake your world.  The story is very realistic (Holocaust), the acting in the movie is excellent. It shows very clearly that children don't see color or class or race unless they are taught to do so.  Our family watched this movie together after we read the book.  We have an adopted son (16 yrs) who is African American (we are Caucasian) and we wanted him to realize that prejudice is not just about Blacks and Whites, the Civil War, or the Civil Rights movement.  It's about a sinful human nature that we all have.  And we are all in need of God's transformational power to change us.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This drama is one that deals with everyday circumstances in a way that is believable. That makes it worth watching. The setting is one that though unfamiliar, causes one to imagine what it might be like to live in a country where status means so much! I also like the sub-culture of the hired help. Very entertaining!
0345404475|5.0|This book is so perfect that I find it hard to believe that I have not heard more about it.  If it reminds me of anything, it is Conrad's the Heart of Darkness.  There is a poetry and minimalism to the story that is all it's own.  There is nothing extraneous, nothing missing.  The world is clear; it is fuzzy.  The world just shifts ever so slightly as the hover craft travels to different realities; realities that are mere situations in the story line.  Its no wonder that Blade Runner became a classic.  The movie had so much to draw from.  Unlike The Man in the High Castle it doesn't read like a near final draft, it is complete. Unlike A Scanner Darkly it doesn't read like a rough draft.  Why PKD didn't have the time to shape the other novels the way he shaped this one is a mystery that I can probably solve by reading more PDK and criticism.  But finding another book to compare it to is for me impossible.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|have you egad wondered what. it would be like to be a shark.  well I have and that is Why I think this is a graet game.  cause you can eat fish you can eat small fish. you can eat big fish. and you can eat 200 difirnet types of fish thair are no ads good for kids and can. ceep.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Good drama, good history, and if you enjoy good British actors. This is a must to watch.  Yada yada yada.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Pretty clean film, with some political overtones, but lots of fast action and intense, grab your attention, plot changes. Some of the reviews called it dark, but I thought it was a classic good versus evil, resurrected bad guy kind of film. Far better than some of the gore and shock stuff plastered all over the screen. Gotta see it for yourself. You will either live it or hate it.
1433514818|5.0|This is the first new study bible I have bought in 25 years, and I highly recommend it.  An online version comes with the purchase and it is wonderful.  The bible verses, and the notes as well as John Piper's sermons are in three columns beside each other, and the ability to highlight parts of the bible in seven different colors is very helpful.  And the notes that refer to verses are all hot linked.<br />Also after studying the chapter you can click on the link and sit and listen to it read back to you.<br /><br />When I study this bible, I always use the online version, because it is much easier to navigate than using the physical bible.<br /><br />This online study bible takes bible study to a whole new level.
B00B5ARKDE|1.0|I purchased this thinking I would receive a minifigure of Clark Kent and didn't really care about the movie. The minifigure in the picture is not included in what you receive. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ONLY WANT THE MOVIE!!
1250029465|5.0|James' and Bob's story is wonderful to read!! As a cat lover and caretaker, I was intrigued by the story line when I read it on Amazon.com and then found the interview with Bob and James via the Guardian, U.K., and was drawn into their story, ordered it, and thanks to Amazon prime, got the book in a day, read it and have ordered the sequel which came out in late June. Bob and James found each other when they needed each other, and that is what many of us who have pets know: our pets save us for they teach us to selflessness. Yes, and children do this to with their parents, which is why it is understandable how James compares his relationship to Bob as a parent with his child.<br /><br />What James went through as a drug addict is heart wrenching to read of, and I am impressed how he writes he is responsible for this and he took the responsibility to come clean and detox. That took courage, and Bob, as he states in the book, helped him here.<br /><br />I am also going to order the children's version as a holiday gift for some young family members.<br /><br />A wonderful book, which shows the compassion of humanity on many levels. Buy it, read it, savor it and pass it along to another reader.
B008JFUO4U|2.0|First one didn't play in our PS3. Tried another movie in Blu-ray and it played fine. Cleaned disc. Downloaded updates. Still didn't play. Held this up to the light and it's the most transparent Blu-ray I've ever seen, but clean and scratch free. Returned for another copy. That one didn't play. I heard that Universal had problems with the manufacturer. No kidding. I wondered if I should review it at all, and then remembered somebody who zinged a book because an entire printing run was missing some pages. I was glad they did; saved me the trouble of buying that book.<br /><br />Tried a third version and it didn't work. Watched it on DVD instead. Enjoyable SF/Mystery movie filled with homages or cliches, take your pick. Afterwards I found that if I disabled the Internet connection, the Blu-ray would work. Universal tries to download new trailers and it locks up the system. Because, you know, Universal can't be bothered to test their products before releasing them.
B005LAII44|5.0|I loved this movie when it came out in theaters.  This movie is full of action and emotion.  To not have this movie in your home collection would be a shame.  Buy it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|My only complaint was that the author repeated himself a lot, I kinda wish he would have assumed we remember what he already said.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This movie really gets to the heart of your soul.  The performances are outstanding. Would recommend.  The story captures everything.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Literally my new favorite book. I've recommended this book to many friends who also enjoyed it.<br /><br /> The second one isn't as good... and I can't wait for the third. Hurry up Pat!
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I also loved this movie when I went to see it.  So much action and surprises.  The graphics are wonderful.  If you live Twilight, you will love this movie.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|The endless effects of growing up as a sibling of a chimp, or vice versa, boggles the mind.  That those effects were not really seriously considered by the parents at the time is hard to understand.  Glad it had a good ending.
B00CFA222M|5.0|I cannot tell you how many times I watched this movie.  I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  I liked the story line and how they set up the scenes to capture more of the giants role in this old story.  This movie is definitely worth having in your movie collection.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I think that they really have a surprisingly fun game!  You never know what New trick you'll come across and they all are very clever!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I really loved this movie and could not wait until it came out on DVD.  The action and love shared between sibling is very touching.  This movie is also filled with a a lot of action, twists and turns.  Buy it.
B00006AUIG|5.0|The voices alone will creep you out - but the story is a psychological thriller<br />and Peter Mullan totally rocks it...the film wouldn't have been nearly as good<br />without him.  However, the eebie vibes you get just from the psyche ward voices<br />is enough to hold anyone's interest...anyone's!  This one is my fave of the psychological<br />thriller genre.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Love the graphics. As good as neverwinter on line. Best android game I have played. I hope to see more like this.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|The very idea that this happened in the 1920s makes one uneasy about the &#34;good ol' days&#34;.<br />Angelina Jolie was so excellent in this; she really was.  I am not a fan of hers as she reminds<br />me far too much of her dad - her looks and her personality, (blech) but even Jon Voigt was good in &#34;The Champ&#34;...<br />every dog has their day and this, in my opinion, was Angelina's day.
B007J7LFTW|4.0|(Alert) I have been a Jethro Tull/Ian Anderson fan for over 35 years and Aqualung was this first album I ever bought.<br /><br />While Thick As A Brick 2 lacks the high energy of TAAB, it is more of a continuation of Mr. Anderson's reflections on the past. While not as good as The Secret Language of Birds, none of the songs seem to be contain a decent hook, it is still a good album to turn on and consider the possibilities of your own life choices. There comes a time where the angry young man reaches an age where he should rest in the warm sun with a drink and let younger people take up the the good fight.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It was a great download and it worked well.  I was able to use it well and safely.  I like the game of Solitare.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|I'm a huge bones fan so every season is amazing in my perspective. This and season eight are the best ones out there but every season is amazing.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great storyline, excellent characters and video, and graphics that are clear and fluid. The hidden object puzzles are abundant and somewhat challenging. I can see replay value in this game. Just a tip - use your resources (aka your map in your notebook) it'll save you a lot of &quot;now where do I go?&quot; moments. Lots of locations - if you like hidden object games, this is a great pick! I'll definitely be buying the sequel! Have fun!
034580404X|5.0|Extremely erotic! Love all the interestingly detailed sexual experiences the couple has together.  This is a definite referral to all my closest friends!!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I was compromised by the fact that I saw season 2 before season 1.  Season 2 was outstanding. As for season 1, the storyline and the acting were great but the cinematography was not as clean as it was in season 2.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Much better than what people are saying.  Don't expect the meaning of life out of this.  It is just a good action Sci-Fi flick.  Cruise is intense as usual.
B001LXIDVS|5.0|This is the last of a really funny series! I love this movie its just to bad its the last! I would tell anyone to go out and get the last of the best!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Great Game to challenge the mind. I loved playing it.  It gets very addictive.  Couldn't put it down. Wish they had more levels.
B000FA675C|5.0|A masterpiece. Mr. Brown made a great job putting together so many intricate puzzles and facts about Da Vinci's works.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I love this movie and this is a great edition. Have to watch it every year and makes a great gift
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I can't remember how many nights I went to bed longing for the next day to come so that I could continue reading this story. So many  specific details that made my imagination go wild
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Zero Stars.  Into Darkness lies at the bottom of the Star Trek Cannon, right next to Nemesis. If you like science fiction that features underwater spaceships, magical healing blood, rehashed scenes from previous movies, unbelievable romantic dialogue, crewman being randomly promoted left and right, unnecessary cameos, ridiculous fight scenes on silly high speed floating platforms, people crashing from space and surviving, honest officers being transformed into mass murderers for no reason and villains wearing unnecessary trench coats then Into Darkness might be the movie for you.  Is it a fun action movie? Yes. But it's not Star Trek.  This movie doesn't have the Enterprise boldly go anywhere. As for the thought provoking concepts?  We get terrorism. It's not that the concept doesn't deserved analysis, it's that it was already done better in all 7 seasons of DS9, and season 3 of Enterprise.  Nothing interesting here. Just lots of shaky cam fight scenes which are tiresome after ten seconds. And finally the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves.  They created a whole new timeline because they said they needed to free themselves from the constraints of cannon. So what do they do with all that freedom?  Remake Space Seed and Wrath of Kahn while referencing The Original Series every five minutes. For me, watching this movie was an insulting experience.  The only thing I liked about it was the cast and their performances.  I think JJ has done a great job with his actors. They deserve writers.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|After reading the first two books I thought it was impossible that Brown would come up with another original story. I was utterly mistaken. There isn't a single page that bored me at all. Good job!
B00821OX98|5.0|great entertainment, love that it is without commercials,after season one it still was great, not just prolonged. good story line
0553801473|5.0|Thank you so much. I love george and the A song of ice and fire. The price was amazing!!!!! Debbie
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Both of the lead actors and all the supporting cast do a great job in this movie. We saw every plot point coming, but the writing was so crisp and performances so good that we didn't care.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It's cool but u cant get as much stuff as in pc. If you ask me get WorldCraft it's online/global and i rated it 5 out of 5 stars.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|This movie just couldn't quite find it's tone. It was too serious/good to be an enjoyable B movie, but not good enough to be a great action flick. It kept faltering between hokey jokes and badassery in a way that just wasn't very much fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Flipping fun to play I don't see there is a reason not to buy it and not play it is such a fun game had it ever since it came out yeah fun game true story
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|J. Cole brings lyricism, flow and charisma in his sophomore album. In the era of untalented, unoriginal clones and sound-a-likes, J. Cole brings originality and substance. If you've become disenchanted with the modern hip-hop scene this album should quench your thirst for quality hip-hop.<br /><br />The album starts out strong with \\"Villuminati\\". A partially orchestral, heavy footed track featuring a mix of cocky braggadocios rhymes and introspection, a perfect embodiment of J. Cole as an artist. A personal favorite \\"Power Trip\\" features a stuttering synth bassline and gliding flute melody punctuated by Miguel's vocals. Cole raps about catching feelings for a woman that he get out of his mind in light of all the women he's see's day to day. \\"Runaway\\" features a jazzy progression and a muted, shuffling drum break in the distance. On \\"Rich N****z\\" Cole recounts his growing up poor, struggling and his appreciation for the little things. In \\"Chaining Day\\" J. Cole questions the merits and true value of jewelry and material things.<br /><br />In \\"Crooked Smile\\" he delivers a powerful sermon about the importance of being himself and being comfortable in your own skin atop a smooth, mid-tempo R&B infused instrumental. In \\"Let Nas Down\\" he airs his disappointment over hip-hop legend Nas's criticism of what he saw as him compromising his artistic integrity. The album finishes strong with the title track \\"Born Sinner\\", a soulful track with skittering drums, smooth vocals on the hook and a textured choir to end the song.<br /><br />I can truly say there's not a single song on this album that i'd label as \\"filler\\". I can listen to this album from being to end without considering skipping a a single song. One of the best hip-hop albums released in years in my opinion. For true lovers of hip-hop this album is a must buy...
B003V2HWP0|3.0|As far as chick flicks go it had all the elements you would expect, love, heartache, death and of course a happy ending.
B004FQX59I|5.0|I saw this film in the theater when it was released. When the D/A Garrison (Kevin Kostner) was shown giving the jury his closing remarks...\\"The CIA, the Pentagon, the Secret Service , all the way to the White House was complicit ( not a quote...but the effect of the words are the same)...the audience chuckled, laughed, smirked. If the film is shown today, that summation will bring very few similar reactions. Garrison got more right than most Americans can deal with. Oliver Stone owes no one an explanation, and CERTAINLY, no apology for this film. The actors delivered far beyond what any of the politicians ever have since. GREAT FILM!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game deserves 5 stars because it is a really fun game!!!! It is fun for all ages from 2 to 102!!!! I think it is the best game ever made.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Good writing. Likeable characters. As the series progresses we learn more of the flaws and strengths of each of them
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love Dragons so I new that I would love this Free app Of Dragonvale it is so fun.Woow. ironmanwv@live.com
B00866JL96|5.0|really loved the whole story ( really followed the book) and thought that Zac Effron was really terrific in the role. Really like all of Nicholas Sparks books that have been made into movies.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Even after all this time, 7 years after the great unravelling started, this book is a stunning revelation of a financial system gone amuck. A riveting and upsetting story of bankers going to the casino with our money and betting that the Other guy will lose it all! You've got to read it to believe it.
B000JCSBU0|3.0|The movie has good cinematography and distinguished soundtrack. There is great acting by Burstyn but also some cliche bad guys portraits. The movie lost me on long abstract hallucination scenes by the main character. It is disturbing to watch without making the point any further. She is hooked on diet pills and television. You get the message the first time, but the movie insists on exaggerating the effects not so artfully . If you get uncomfortable watching dragged out scenes of nightmares you wouldn't like the movie specially towards the end.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|A lot of fun!<br />It's a little addictive with tasks and the economy, but the story is very good.<br />Lots of cute mini games to build up your skills.  hours of fun.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|This was a great movie.  I didn't know about it until Red 2 came out.  We liked Red 2 and took a chance on Red.  I highly recommend seeing it.  If you like high action scenes with a decent story line, this is for you.  Bruce Willis and John Malkovich are a great pair and really make a great team.  It was certainly worth the $1.99!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great miniseries, it reflects that era with much reality. Can hardly wait for the next season,. It should be very exciting
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|wanted an ending to a trilogy and got an extension with lots of distractions from the main story.  i feel ripped off.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|I found it odd, how when I plugged the controller up, it said it wasnt charging... several hours later, STILL NOT CHARGED<br /><br />not to mention the dead zones, the clunky feel, and the terrible triggers<br /><br />AVOID
B00E5SCOS4|5.0|My wife and I liked some of KT Tunstall's earlier music, but we haven't heard anything about her for a while. Then, last night she was the musical guest on the Tonight Show, performing \\"Feel It All\\". I fell in love with the song -- the words, the melody, and the way she played the guitar. I had to have it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I enjoy the characters and time in which this series is set.  The setting is beautiful and it's a gentle show.
0767919408|5.0|Another great read by Bill Bryson.  In this tome, Bryson takes us through one summer in America.  The year is 1927.  The main topics are Lindberg's flight over the Atlantic, Babe Ruth's amazing career, prohibition, and the monetary talks that lead, in part, to the collapse of the stock market in 1929.  If you are like me, you are probably thinking that you aren't all that interested in reading a 500 page book on any or all of these topics.  Well, when Mr. Bryson tackles these topics, you will likely be interested.  I certainly was.  I could not stop reading this book once I started it.  I enjoy all the details about the people (Lindberg's lack of personality, Babe Ruth's legendary generosity and the IRS worker who came up with the idea of going after gangsters for tax fraud).  If you have read any other Bryson books (including his travel book) and enjoyed them, you will enjoy this book, too.  The tone is conversational and easy to read.  You will become invested in the story-line and the outcomes.  You may even learn a thing or two about American history.  It's probably a little too long for most book clubs, but it is filled with plenty of topics to discuss if you can convince everyone to read it.
B005Y0OFVG|1.0|I choose this rating because the book wouldn't end! I normally read a book right through even if it's awful but this book was silly, Yes silly. I don't know what other word to use for all of the characters.<br /><br />I do not recommend you buy this book if you like your main hero and heroine to act like adults.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It is good to see a tv show that is half way decent now a days and have to resort to searching online for wholesome shows.  This is definite a to see series.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works great,  it keeps my kindle charged just fine. If I need another one I will get it here.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am hooked! I'm recommending this to many who like me, have never seen the show!  I went through the first season so quickly that I'm trying to pace myself this time.
B000001Y79|1.0|No doubt is the worst music i have ever heard. i wouldnt waste my money on it if it was the last music in the world. they suck and if you buy their music then you are stupid. seriously, you will regret it if you are dumb enough to actually spend your money on it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Challenging, good way to pass time.  I like that it has a pause feature, and being timed makes it more of a challenge.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Christine Baker Kline really set the scene for this heartbreaking and heartwarming novel. So many interesting characters with such different life styles coming together. Since I was reading this on my kindle, I didn't pay attention to the page numbers and when I went to the next page and the book was done, I couldn't believe it. I wanted it to continue!
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I really like how this story line deviates from the other SG shows.  The other shows condensed a story line into a few minutes of light drama, action, comedy, and always &#34;saved the day&#34; no matter how far gone things were.<br /><br />SGU does not do this!  While there is a plot in each show, there is still the large plot that is &#34;where are we going, and why?&#34;.  The story line is more adult/grown up, and is a more of a mature &#34;soap opera&#34;.<br /><br />To bad the series ended short, due to the reasons I stated.  It lost the key group that kept the other SG series going.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's great we love it we fight over the kindle just to play it it's tons of fun by :christian 11.  Bananas i love it do u no y I Love it be cause u can get bananas and have fun and use one minion I like that u can dress them i can run like the minions I luv everything by s
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I like the way Dan Brown writes. It is always interesting and has many twists and turns to his plots.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was a beautifully written novel and touched  me emotionally. Through personal experiences, I was able to relate to the characters and their motives. It was one of the best novels I have ever read.  Highly recommended!
B00005V0X5|4.0|I have the vanilla of this too. Hate it when you get locked into the specific sounds to have it tweaked later. My favorite Megadeth still.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|[[ASIN:B00BDSRKHO English Electric]]<br />Well done, OMD, well done! Best album in years.It goes back to Dazzle Ships and Organization, some of OMD's best stuff.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Everything you expect from Tarantino movie. Great cast, uncomfortable language, but fits the movie. Some hard scenes to watch too, but in a good way.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC ARTIST Dream. This App. is what every Artist should have downloaded on their own Devices.

B004EPZ08E|5.0|Hilarious movie. I loved all actors, even liked the character that Collin Farrell played and that's since I don't really like the actor. Jenniffer Anniston probably had the best role. Great comedy, would love to see it again!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Awesome game. I love nemo. Graphics are awesome. Never have to worry. Addicting and fun. And the music is amazing.
0446310786|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  I have read it before, but it was good enough to read again.  Thanks.
B008602KQI|5.0|It's interesting and a good movie to watch, also sad , the acting is good, as well as  the effects.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|mother could not understand anything spoken to her as ALL the background noise is amplified along with the spoken words.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|Nothing exceptionally noteworthy here, but I enjoyed the film. The characters were appealing and the story sufficed for its purpose. I must admit to a bit of obtuseness since it took me until the balcony scene to realize that Julie and R. and this movie were descendants of one of the Bard's most famous plays... An interesting retelling of a classic, I suppose. If you are the super-critical type and a stickler for believability, avoid this film. If you can just go with it, do.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|for best navigation on linked in, I highly recommend the app versus just navigating via the internet... easy to get to where you need to be to review and stay on top of interactions.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It was awesome. It was an interesting look at history.  I felt like I was part of history. Ken Follett is an amazing author..Can't wait for the last book of the trilogy.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|action packed and full of adventure from the very beginning..  Starts suspensful and doesn't stop... awesome movie for everyone in the family.
1781162646|4.0|I am a big fan of Stephen King. I buy every book he puts out. In general I enjoy all of them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome to play you can build you can dig . It's to much money lower the price for it . Maybe worth $4.99.<br />It's a good game.<br />I love mincraft. Coooooooooooooooooool I love it I don't care I love it I love it.<br />You should make a Mario craft.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Just play it. It's worth it. Plus if you're reading this your bored anyway. This part is $81!  Just let me play.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I had never seen this until my girlfriend told me I had to!  It was a great movie from the 80's that I enjoyed!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|5 stars isn't enough of a review?  i love this movie. the dvd version was awful. i had 2 of them and both of them would skip and stall on either side of the disc. that sucked.  the bluray i received was perfect. sound was excellent. and most importantly NO SKIPPING. good seller.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|more of a challenge than first appears.....fun way  wile away some time and get your mind working.  good for thrbolder mond
B00881VLCE|5.0|What a great way to relax after a stressful day!  Great variety of puzzles. I am having a hard time stopping.
B0085CV0TA|4.0|Do not look for a faithful adaptation of a Clive Cussler novel here, but instead expect to see some of his core concepts and themes rolled into an otherwise typical Hollywood popcorn flick.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|I found it very hard to use the filling in forms feature. The instructions are very limited and not user friendly
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Especially for animal lovers who must say goodbye to beloved pets. And for readers comfortable with fantasy.  I hope this talented author keeps giving us new delights and challenges to our imagination.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Bruno Mars never, never disappoints! I truly haven't seen or heard an artist like this since Prince! He is nostalgic & his energy & vibe bring his music to life! I love this man!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun escape game.  Keeps you entertained ones without getting frustrated. Can't wait for more rooms to escape from.  Thanks
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is one of the funniest and most entertaining animated movies I've watched, the minions are awesome!!! I can't wait for the second one to be out on blu-ray.
B004YW4L5K|3.0|Mr. Gaiman started out with a good premise - Gods are \\"different\\" in the New World. But nifty ideas are like peanuts. You can't stop at just one. By the end the 500 or so pages we have enough plot threads for a dozen stories and little sense of the book's true direction.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|This movie made me laugh till tears came out of my nipples. I would have given it five stars by my doctor said I will have to have nipple removal surgery to fix the flow problems. Overall a good movie, but beware of nipple loss.
B004TMPJP6|3.0|I still don't get this app. maybe I don't know what I'm doing with it. who knows but I just don't get the hype surrounding it. I guess a little &#34;getting to know you&#34; time is on tap, along with a PBR :)
0061992860|5.0|Most of this is common sense and I have a hard time believing people need such basic information.  I guess if you grew-up and lived in a City your entire life this would open up an entire new world.  That being said, there are some excellent nuggets on plant-lore that more than makes this a good buy.  It is a POCKET GUIDE, so you it is very small for a backpack.
B000002JSR|3.0|As a long time Zeppelin fan I can still enjoy this album, and there are a couple songs still pretty good on this album, but, its still Zeppelin at their worst. It's an album of left overs from their previous albums that they had to come up with to meet their contract after John Bonham died. If you love Zeppelin and have all their other albums then get it, if not, then buy any of their other albums first, starting with the first five albums.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just fantastic books. If you haven't read the series, do so. NOW. The first I think is the best, but the second is still excellent, and better than the third... which is still very good.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Very believable and played well by a well put together cast. You can tell a lot of research went into this because it shows things that actuall happen on the street, maybe its a little overdone but its TV and it has to be exciting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is just fantastic. While I thought the movie did a very good job of capturing the story, the book is still better, as they almost always are.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|Ridiculously short time span allowed per race section.  One mistake and you run out of time. With a game that's full throttle all the time mistakes are easy. After the 5th time I drove the same section I deleted this from my tablet. I want games to enjoy not to cause frustration. Glad it was free. I'd be upset if I'd wasted money on this.
0061733199|5.0|I believe this really should be required reading for anyone who is a survivalist or prepper. I figured I would skim through it, but ended up reading a few chapters in their entirety. I went ahead and deleted some books on my Amazon Wishlist because this one book contains most of what I was looking for in other titles. I also think this book should be protected and kept in your BOB or wherever you keep important documents that you will take with you in an emergency.<br />Since you can \\"Look Inside\\" you can check out the table of contents and read a few pages for yourself. The only other book I am considering, as an addition, is the Survival Medicine Handbook ( [...] ). With those two titles, there isn't much left except for more specialized skills you wish to acquire.<br /><br />Recommended? Yes.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought several USB to RS-232 converters years ago. At the time they worked on the Mac. But Apple dropped support for the chip set used (they still work with Windows XP). I found this converter and it works.
1781162646|4.0|Hey! this reminded me of the old paperback crime novels my dad used to read in the '50s! It was a cool plot and as usual, the author's descriptions just about make you taste the cotton candy and smell the grease of the carnival rides! I gave a copy to my son for his birthday and he liked it too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because, well, that seems like it ought to be saved for King's giant amazing blockbusters !
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Wasn't fantastic, but a very good movie. Nothing inappropriate. Good movie for the whole family, all ages will find this entertaining.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My granddaughter has watched this over and over. It's a wonderfully<br />done story.  Thank you!  Sent it to another granddaughter as well.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|very well done. Lots of action, a great cast that works very well together. This is a must see movie.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|It's good, I'm enjoying the story, it's turning to be a dark story of the downward spiral of a couple of men.  I like seeing the story filmed in Albuquerque and having NM references, reminds me of home.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I really enjoy having this, it's fun to have friends around and all of us adding to the youtube video queue or picking out something on Netflix.<br /><br />This device works wonderfully with android phones and tablets, i've tried both.<br /><br />Where this thing falls short is the casting of tabs on your Chrome browser on your computer. The quality is simply terrible even on the lowest settings. The audio stutters and the video is rubbish.<br /><br />I had to call Google about this so i'll make a note here for everyone that wants to buy one: It only works with devices connected to your wireless network! If your desktop is hard wired into your home, you will not be able to use chromecast. Wifi only!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I had read the book already but I liked the movie eventhough it has too many killings for my taste.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I enjoyed playing this. Most of the puzzles at the start were a bit too easy but got a bit more difficult as the chapters went on. Like other reviewers, I found it a bit too pernickity at times regarding placement of the objects & had to enlarge the screen at times to get objects to fit. The talking was annoying but just play with the sound muted & read the sub-titles. Also, you can skip the dialogue out altogether if you want to. I was playing on kindle fire & had no glitches with saving the chapters. Graphics were good. On the whole, pleasantly diverting.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|This is a strange indie comedy about a awkward teenaged boy who lives with his 32 year old brother and his grandmother.  Things aren't great for him, his lips hurt real bad and he can't train to be a cage fighter, but things start looking up for him when he meets a nice girl and he becomes friends with a kid who just moved there from Mexico.<br /><br />You either love this movie or you hate it, if you are on the fence about it and see it again, you might start liking it more. I saw this in the theater and I liked it just enough to buy the DVD.  But every time I watched it I liked it a little more, it didn't bother me anymore that the plot was a little aimless, it was just funny and it kept getting funnier.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|Classic, one of the best 80s movies.  A triumphic story of a kid that had adult leadership and counseling from a wise Mr Miagi.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I enjoyed this book just I always do when I read John Grisham.  He has a way of writing a number of types of books covering a broad range of topics and characters.  I like that his output is never predictable, and he always has a way of surprising us.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I couldn't put it down!!  The first time I read this author.  Now off to The Secret Kept.......I hope it is as good.
1781162646|5.0|This was a great and interesting read, and especially since it is the type of book King hasn't done in a long while.  I enjoyed the story and characters, and it was great to see where the narrative would go.
B002ZG9968|5.0|They make a cute couple but have issues or she does.  They finally work them out and every thing is fine.  Lots of funny places in the movie too.  I have watched it quite a few times since I got it.  May have to purchase another if i wear this one out.  lol
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|never saw this odrer . you took my payment twice and still could not see the video and there is no place to report this problem!!!!!<br /> this is the second time this that it has happen . please fix this!!!!!!!!!!!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Surprised that I liked it as much asi did!  Very well rotten.  A bit too much info regarding the to racing circuit, but very entertaining and lots to think about.
B000TDDHQC|5.0|If you know/like Buddy Rich you'll love this music.  Obviously some tracks are a little higher quality music than the others but overall it is a must have and at these prices there is no reason not to be able to enjoy this music.  I first heard it and Swingin' New Big Big in 1967!  Both are as good now as they were then -- I'll take that back -- even better now.  Good times, fantastic music and fantastic musicians!
B002PGO7X8|5.0|I love all of his songs, but his first album is by far the best. This is one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time and it is a must have for any Kid Cudi fan.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The atmosphere created by the combination of lighting, music, and graphics enhances the entire experience of puzzle solving in a wonderful way.  I can only hope that there are many more &quot;rooms&quot; to come.  Highly recommended.
B00C1S945G|4.0|I am a trekkee so am enjoying going back and seeing some of my favorite episodes. I will continue to watch it.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|What a beautiful, unexpected book. The language, the effortless shifting through time, the mystery tied up with the main character's upbringing, I loved everything about this book and devoured in quickly. Highly recommend.
B007NZH738|5.0|I unfortunately lost all my vinyl record collection in a devastating house fire in April, 2013. I vowed not to grieve my material losses. I have to say that when I saw I could replace Tommy, I was VERY happy. This record was in great condition, and the smile hasnt left my face.<br />  Tommy has many wonderful songs that stand<br /> on their own. But listening to the whole thing, with the magnificent intrumentals ,just makes you love Tommy more.The Who are a very talented group. My album was well worm as I listened to it often. If you havent listened to the whole rock opera, listen to it soon. It is a masterpiece!
B00AW57L96|5.0|I read this quickly to see what happened !!! Very enjoyable read. I will be looking out for more of Liane Moriarty.
B004F95OQM|5.0|I love this album. I also owned the vinyl LP and lost it in a devastating house fire in April, 2013. I have great memories of listening to this album. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.<br />There are many great pieces on this album. There are no songs on it that I dont like. Baba O'Riley always brings a smile on my face. It has to be one of my most favorite. You can go wrong buying this album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|just like temple run except begetter with bosses. anyone who love temple run will love this game. and if you've seen the second move you'll totally understand.
B00488SU02|5.0|Very interesting movie. A must see for those who like psychological thrillers and those against the death penalty. Very nice twist at the end but need to watch for it.
B005PK57NU|5.0|I can´t stop watching it, I can´t wait untill I have time for watching the next chapter. It´s a must.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was fun to watch. It was like a spoof on Bond or serious action movies and Willis is always fun to watch.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The best ive  read.  Could not put the book down. My whole family has read it.  I CANT WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONE
B00BR476TG|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but very deep. I would not watch it again. I did not like the animal presentations.
B0090SI56Y|3.0|\\"The Wolverine\\" (2013) takes place after \\"[[ASIN:B000HCO83Q X-Men: The Last Stand (Widescreen Edition)]]\\" (2006) and focuses on Logan in Japan. It's reminiscent of Chris Claremont & Frank Miller's original 1982 4-part Wolverine miniseries.<br /><br />Like that miniseries, the film is very atypical for comic book superheroes. It plays out more like a James Bond flick, sort of a modern version of \\"[[ASIN:B000NIBUS0 You Only Live Twice]]\\", than a conventional superhero flick. Logan (Hugh Jackman) never appears in an outlandish costume, nor do any other characters, except Viper, and hers isn't all that outlandish.<br /><br />The beginning is great -- the World War II prologue and the Yukon sequences. I also enjoyed the Japanese locations and culture, as well as the focus on drama mixed with stellar bouts of comic book action. Unfortunately, I found the story only moderately interesting, which is the main reason I rate the film as mediocre as I do. It just isn't all that captivating.<br /><br />I really liked the character of Yukio (Rila Fukushima), and Hiroyuki Sanada makes a quality antagonist, but I found Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) rather bland. The Silver Samurai also appears in an armored suit a la Iron Man or War Machine and comes across as typical for this type of fare.<br /><br />In addition, Famke Janssen appears as Jean Grey. She's fine in the role, but she never tripped my trigger. The best lookin' woman in the entire film, believe it or not, is the cashier who talks to Logan briefly in Yukon.<br /><br />I'll be honest with you, I thought 2009's \\"[[ASIN:B002K99P7S X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]\\" was better than this one. Despite the cartoony opening, it had more depth and was way more compelling. Still, \\"The Wolverine\\" is a solid depiction of Wolverine's adventures in Japan.<br /><br />The film runs 2 hours and 6 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: C+ or B-
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome especially the update there are even 3 places  you can be while running : Gru's lab *of course. residential,and El Mocho's lair!And there's more, power ups!

B0012QVJXS|4.0|AFTER 35 YEARS THE STORY AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS STAND UP COMPARED TO THE OVER THE TOP STUFF OUT THERE TODAY. AND CHRISTOPHER REEVE WAS EVEN BETTER THAN HIS NAMESAKE GEORGE. JACKIE COOPER AND GENE HACKMAN ARE OUTSTANDING. I STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY MARGOT KIDDER GOT THAT PART. SHE'S THE BIGGEST DRAG ON THE FILM. THANK GOODNESS FOR THE GREAT BRANDO.
B00AFEY354|5.0|My 15 year old daughter saw this movie in the theatre and loved it so much, she wanted to own the DVD .
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Q.T. knows more than most writers and producers. Pretty amazing film beginning to end.  A must see that has emphasis on the pre-civil war...
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|I saw this movie on DVD and loved the music. I bought one CD for me and one for my mother-in-law, who also loved the music.
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|This film is an indoctrination piece disguised as a children's film. The purpose of this film is to help usher children into our broken, sex soaked, culture of rebellious acceptance. If, as a parent, you do not want your child to be fit into this mold, please avoid this film and others like it unless you are prepared to dissect it and carefully walk your child through the deep despair that this film disguises as happiness.
1781162646|2.0|The book went on way too long for a simple story and the suspense part of it with the ghost was boring. I was surprised that this was a king novel. The murderer of that girl who becomes a ghost had no motive and wasn't interesting.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have and will always love the wimpy kid series. It's a good and funny book that you can read over and over without getting board. I recommend it to everyone.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|A &#34;double plus good&#34; analysis of what political propaganda actually is and how it is used to manipulate and control.  The story shows how inhuman people can become and there is no dark or light but something in between through peoples morality or immorality.  A truly great trilogy.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I've always had trouble sleeping, so I got this app to help. I was asleep the instant my head hit the pillow. Great for relaxing, meditation, etc. I would recommend it to anyone who has trouble sleeping.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|More distopia in an Agenda 21 - FEMA camp society with nasty betrayal to the Victors.  Couldn't put it down.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Fast paced thriller. Hard to view only 1 episode at a time. Pace yourself or you will run through them and be wanting more, more, more
B005EGXTEE|5.0|A disturbing distopic future where people find themselves in a slave society where their children are used to amuse the elites
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|You are thrust into the thick of things fairly early on, and have to really grapple out of it without any idea what the significance of certain events are until much later in the story. But, it is a wonderfully rounded story and you do get all the context eventually.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|All his books are very informative and I really enjoy his stories.Always think it is good to read about life in different countries.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Zero stars. No story line, no transition between one time and another, just jumps around. Gratuitous violence, profanity, and soft porn to get the \\"R\\" rating.<br /><br />Right down there with \\"Zardoz\\" and \\"Quintet\\" giving big-budget sci-fi a bad name.<br /><br />If this movie were re-cut to a linear story line, and the \\"R\\" stuff removed, it might be a 2-hour movie worth watching, not three hours of \\"Huh?\\"<br /><br />Halle Berry looks nice, as always.<br /><br />Tom Hanks gives it the old college try, but cannot save it.<br /><br />Nice cinematography and CGI. OK music. Lots of mumbled dialogue.<br /><br />Note to producers: confusing the audience does not equate to \\"art.\\"
B0051OZ564|5.0|Sucker Punch grabs you from the first second and doesn't ever let go.  Both visually stunning and emotionally vivid.  Definitely recommended.
B00DURILJ2|3.0|An \\"ok\\" movie with: an \\"ok\\" plot; \\"ok\\" actors/acting; \\"ok\\" (slightly interesting) cinematography. DOES have some graphic violence and strong language. Recommend? Perhaps if you have nothing else to do and TV only offers reruns. Am glad I did not pay to see this in a theater!!
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Cameron Diaz's acting is the only reason I drop the rating on this. It's terrible. Everything else is superb. A lovely story that will warm your heart.
B005UG542S|5.0|This is my favorite book series and I'm equally find of the movies! I've loved growing up with the actors. Great ending to the series.
B00699SDR8|4.0|This is written for people who are new to the concept of philosophical thought. It helps build reasoning and logic. It is also a nice light read for those of us who would like to brush up on philosophy. The story is interesting enough to keep you engaged most of the time.
B008JFUN50|2.0|One would think that creating a film and spending $100M (mostly on cast fees) that a movie that well advertised would be something special.<br />It isn't!!!  Same old story line that mimics 100 different science fiction films. Zero plot and often VERY boring.  Bummer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Liked this game very much. Can't wait for more rooms. Had to have help on getting past level 10. Will be waiting for more rooms.
B001NA6096|5.0|Such a beautifully touching movie with a great script - you know the kind where you actually get to hear the dialogue between the girl and guy instead of music playing over those parts (which leads you to question whether the two of them actually have anything to talk about at all)? Really good and kind of inspiring...
B0095VP8D4|5.0|The A10-5800k is a decent cpu and an acceptable gpu.  Buying an apu is a nice alternative to buying both a cpu and a gpu.  The gpu on the A10-5800k has better integrated video than you will find on any Intel cpu.  This apu is great for a low budget gaming computer and is excellent for a home theater pc.  Buying this apu is cheaper than the combined cost of buying a comparable cpu and gpu.  If overclocking is your thing, the A10-5800k is unlocked and overclocks rather well.
0812550706|2.0|This book won the prestigious Nebula and Hugo Awards in the mid-80s, and as a YA/sci-fi novel, the storyline works well. But this novel also featured some of the more appalling writing I've seen in Children's or YA fiction. One of the features that bothered me was the dialogue. While the idea of recruiting children for warfare definitely drove home the reality of the harsh dystopian world the author has created, I had much difficulty trying to picture in my head 6-year-old army cadets who not only trained in combat, but spouted trash talk with the veracity of jaded veterans.<br /><br />The story centres round one such child, Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggins, who is a \\"Third\\", or a miscreant of sorts for being a violation of Earth's two-child policy, who by the time he's 3, has to fend off a psychotic older brother (a child not much older than him) whose bullying is laced with murderous intent. Ender is protected not by his distant parents, but by his sister, Valentine. The two older Wiggins siblings are highly intelligent, but they are not selected for Battle School like Ender, because for all their super-intelligence, they lack what Ender has, which is empathy, an important quality to have in a commander to fight against the Buggers, an insectoid alien species, who have engaged in two major interplanetary wars with the humans, with a third war being anticipated. Along the way, it becomes clear later why young children needed to be trained so early to get them ready in time for the war. Ender is bundled off to Battle School when he stands up against bullies in school who taunt him, and does violent damage to his chief tormenter, thus proving his killer instinct.<br /><br />For much of the novel, we see Ender being trained through competitive war simulations in a zero-gravity battleroom, and he gradually proves himself to master tactics and show leadership qualities above other cadets, even those that are older and more senior than him. His struggle against his killer instinctbecause of his empathy for the enemy gives him much anguish and it becomes a central concern in the novel. Unfortunately I lost much interest in the detailed descriptions of the strategies and tactics Ender employed and I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book, because I was told it was something worth waiting for. To some extent I was satisfied with it, but it just wasn't engaging enough for me to want to explore the other books in the series.
B009R659L8|4.0|Mary Higgins Clark is always delightful but I thought this book could have had a little more &#34;ump&#34; to it...not quite up to her standards this time.  Next one will be great though.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|App is quirky and ads are excessive, but it does what you need it to do. Open to other options.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome! I've just received my free minecraft giftcode!<br /><br />&gt;&gt; minecraftnow.us &lt;&lt;<br /><br />This is a fun way to waste time. I highly recommend this game
B009KS4XRO|5.0|A lot of fun, I play this game everyday sometimes 3 and 4 times a day for hours at a time.  Very addictive
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Get.ready to be hooked from the first game. I love this game. Just when I thought it was easy, the next game changed that. Try it. It's free. I know you will be entertained and your mind stimulated.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a fantastic book! It really pulls you in and makes you want more. I eagerly wait for more books from the author!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really fun game for ages 1 -99. I downloaded it for my 5 yr.and now I'm hooked on it to... lol
B004XVN1T4|2.0|I usually like Ken Follett books but this one was pretty boring. Ken is best at writing books that take place in older times. This storyline reminds me a lot of Clive Cussler's writing.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|I am embarrassed to say I knew nothing about this horrible saga in African history.  This sobering book (not a new book, by the way!) not only filled that void in my knowledge, it reawakened my concerns generally for more such examples of genocide which, alas, are not so rare as one might wish.  It is not a &#34;fun&#34; read, but it is definitely a quick read, well-written and factual, placing the reader right in the middle of the events and attitudes on all sides.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I have read all of his other books now so ended with his first. His books have gotten alot better as he got more experienced. His first one was not quite as complex but still enjoyable.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Not as good as the original trilogy, but not bad.  Great scenery.  All in all an entertaining film for family.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|The latest album release (and the 2nd) for new-ish frontman William DuVall is crunchy, heavy riffs as the band intended their sound to be from the start.  My particular favorites are &#34;Stone&#34;, &#34;Voices&#34;, and &#34;Breath On A Window&#34;, as they chug along with their bottom heavy sludge core amped up to the max.  Jerry Cantrell's soaring solos are definitely evident as the album plays through.  The distortion is flawless, as is the clean chime in the &#34;softer&#34; ballads.  Overall, an outstanding monument of classic grunge melded with hard rock making this one worth checking out by all means.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|graphic and violent and not always comfortable, but Tarantino takes a great swing at the spaghetti western genre and hits a home run.
B000W93CHC|5.0|An addictive book. Seemed there was never place to put the book down.<br />I didn't think Follett could top PILLARS OF STONE and I'm not sure he did,<br />They are both great reads.  Loved the connection between the books, I learned so much.
B008XK69S6|1.0|I liked the description of this software.  After installation the software scanned the system drive of my android device but would not scan my sd card.  Since I have many gigs of music I keep it on the sd card.<br />I can't find or play my music with this app so serious thumbs down.  I would give it a minus value if I could.
1781162646|5.0|I almost belief it was non fiction. It seemed so real. If you love completed plot in stories, then go for it.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|This app is an easy way to get and play my music.  Amazon has great sales on music. completely integrates with my amazon account.
1400069289|4.0|An interesting book to read. However, it's too technical for many people to read and understand. To benefit a wider audience, the technical jargons should be watered down a bit. I recommend it to people working in behaviour change environments.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|As I'm in my upper 50s, my reflexes amy be too slow to score well in this game. It is very cute and the graphics are quite nice. The kids will love it!
0762434279|5.0|Teaches you how to change your financial situation by having money work for you. Taught me something new. Loved it
B0042U94UQ|4.0|all that it was advertised to be,  funny funny funny .. looking forward to receiving despicable Me 2 in the near future.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A friend introduced this book to me, and I'm glad she did. I'm a very avid reader but i thought this would just be another story about a misfit. Well it isn't. I could feel Charlie's pain and it was amazing. If i could I would give this 100 stars...it left me speechless, it made me cry. I too am a wallflower and many people don't understand us...But we're complicated people.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|not enough dialog and too much singing to each other.. long , drawn out and just did not do what all the hype says....
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Writing just to write. Adding characters for the reason of writing a long book that just seems to go nowhere, blinded by glory for a false circle with no end.
030758836X|3.0|In places Gone Girl is devious, clever and surprising. At it's best it can sit alongside the best thrillers out there but as the plot progresses details unravel and characters make choices which serve the sorry the writer is trying to tell but which make no sense at all to the reader.<br /><br />I don't know if the book is intended to be a setup for a sequel but the ending fizzles, loose ends are left, characters go their separate ways and we are left wondering if our copy was missing a few chapters.<br /><br />In short, not bad but there are plenty of alternatives which should be higher up your list.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great, great fun. I really like the play, the customizations and the replay choices. When will you offer an ad-free version?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is getting me into trouble because it is too much fun...just wish it were easier to get gru coins
B002NNA9N0|1.0|The movie had great actors but I was hoping for more sales sciences like on Boiler Room.  The word leads was oner used.
B003F48E4W|5.0|Loved this film because it was one of the first everyday person vampire films. Well done, great acting and geared to everyone.
B0094MFI52|5.0|Great movie full of action and adventure. I watched it with my nine year old son who loved it, he said, &#34; it's awesome&#34; . Would recommend.
B00555X8OA|5.0|It is one of the most important books in my library.  The mental errors described, many of which are surprising, are relevant to all aspects of life.  .
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Hard to find good comedies that are remotely clean. This was mostly clean and hilarious! Recommend if you are a parent!
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I'm new to Amazon Prime and wanted to get acquainted with the movies available through the service.  I wanted a movie that was light and fun, something I'd seen before that I wouldn't have to sit down and focus on.  This movie completely fits the bill!  Adore Matthew Broderick!  Love the music!  Selected the movie on my blu-ray player and hit play.  Thought I would just watch the first few minutes, then get busy with chores.  But hey, if Ferris can take a day off, so can I.  I sat and watched the whole thing.  A little escapism for a Sunday afternoon.
B007QUUJMG|2.0|It's probably not a bad book for people who like to feel sorry for themselves, or those who feel that the whole world is against them (that can be an appropriate attitude if you are in a difficult situation).<br /><br />I found it hard to sympathise with the central character, although I suppose if the suggestion is that they have some kind of autism, then the character made more sense (and would encourage some empathy/sympathy).<br /><br />Its AMERICAN teenage angst, and sometimes this is not a barrier if the writing is engaging enough. This wasn't. I didn't finish it because I wasn't curious enough to want to know what would happen to any of them.
B009Z5975A|5.0|These are two of our favorite movies, especially gremlins 2. They are funny and we have enjoyed watching them multiple times. The blu ray is good quality.
140006922X|4.0|Purchased this book for my husband. He stated it was very interesting reading, but some parts did differ with some of the teachings in his church.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a cool game and you can play with your friends and the game is a cool game very cool game and there are you in the game and your friends.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Beautiful music, excellent dancing singing and acting by the entire cast.  Interesting plot.  Plan to watch all the seasons and tape the current one.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Cried my eyes out while laughing throughout the whole book.  Great story, great characters. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick meaningful read.
1933492279|5.0|Fantastic and creative design, sketches, drawings and renderings.  Not only drawings, but the book itself designed with a great taste, graphic design and compositions. This book is piece of art.  It is a great addition to the car designer’s library or anyone who likes car design, design in general or automotive art.<br /><br />Very nice publication by Design Studio Press, excellent high quality prints on heavy paper.<br /><br />Impatiently waiting the release of new Daniel Simon’s book “The Timeless Racer: Machines of a Time Traveling Speed Junkie.
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|Note:  First, this review may have spoilers.  Second, after almost 900 submitted reviews, Amazon's computerized censor rejected my original draft, presumably because they didn't like a word or two.  They don't say what it is that is offensive, so undaunted, I continued to make edits until it passed muster.  The version here is my 4th draft.  I've indicated the changes from the original by using [brackets].  See if you can come up with the original word.  There are no words that begin with the letter \\"F\\" and all would be familiar to a typical 7th grader.<br /><br />I read one review that said that no one would buy the premise of Jennifer Aniston being a [ecdysiast]. I assume he's convinced that the 44 year old actress wouldn't look or be able to pull it off. Well, I bought it and trust me there are plenty of 20 year old ladies out there who only wish they had the physical appeal of Ms. A.<br /><br />Now that that is out of the way, Rose quits her job at the [club where women get undressed] because her boss Todd (Ken Marino) insists that she have sexual relations with interested clients. About to get booted out of her apartment for late rent payments, she runs into a neighbor at the mail box. More on that later. David (Jason Sudekis), the neighbor, is the neighborhood drug dealer whose clientele is mostly businessmen, housewives and professionals. But no kids. Principles you know. He is a [jerk] and basically has no friends but for a recently turned 18 year old from the building named Kenny (Will Poulter).<br /><br />Hearing a ruckus outside, Kenny confronts a quartet of street thugs who are hassling Casey (Emma Roberts) an up-and-coming tart complete with tats, body piercings and plenty of black leather. David, against his better judgment intervenes, only to have his cash and cache of drugs stolen by the thugs. When he tells his story to his boss (Ed Helms), his only option is to go to Mexico and bring back a huge stash of marijuana under the name of Pablo Chacon. David doesn't know that Chacon is one of Mexico's most ruthless drug lords.<br /><br />Now back to Rose. David, worried about the border crossing coming back to the U. S. rents a large RV and hires now homeless Rose to act as his wife and Kenny and Casey to play his children. This requires a make-over for all as they must appear to be a suburban family just on vacation. It pretty much works except that the real Chacon is giving chase realizing that his henchmen gave the drugs to the wrong gringo.<br /><br />This film by Rawson Marshall Thurber and a screenplay by Bob Fisher and Steve Faber has a lot going on for it. It's funny, but this isn't a family friendly film, if your family includes young children. Even adults will get a few eye-openers, so if you're easily offended look elsewhere. The \\"R\\" rating is well earned. Sure we get to see the inside of a [club where women get undressed], but the filmmakers do pull their punch here in that the ladies actually don't [remove their clothes].<br /><br />Rose has a great routine well into the film when she must prove she is an [exotic dancer] for Chacon and his cronies. Ms. Aniston has made a career out of gold medal titillation without seeing the... uh... [trophies]. So it is here, but the \\"Flashdance\\" shower routine provides a stimulating tease. There are some funny scenes with a real All-American family in an RV vacation. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn play the parents and Molly C. Quinn is the teen daughter.<br /><br />In what must have been a good news-bad news scenario for actor Poulter, we see his character fumbling the ball on a first kiss opportunity with Ms. Quinn's character, and is given lessons by Casey and Rose in rapid succession. Kenny turns beat red and I don't think it was makeup. Later, he must expose his privates after being bitten on the [testacles] by a large furry spider. While this movie isn't for everyone, I found it funny as [heck].vid doesn't know that Chacon is one of Mexico's most ruthless drug lords.<br /><br />Now back to Rose.

B004IK8Q86|5.0|For me, this book was life changing. I read it three times now: once in 2009, then in 2011 and again this year. I have changed my way of living and perceiving life so much, and every time I feel more connected to the story. Totally recommend it.
B008JFUN50|4.0|There may be spoilers.<br /><br />Admittedly I'm pretty much a sucker for anything sci-fi, especially when it has something of a story.  It is an added bonus when the movie isn't a sequel, a spin off or anything with the words \\"trans\\" in front of it.  Director and writer Neill Blomkamp surprised Hollywood and the public with his 2009 masterpiece, \\"District 9\\" and after a well-earned hiatus gives us this follow-up.<br /><br />In the year 2154 the world has evolved into the haves and the have-nots.  The privileged and wealthy now live on a giant man-made space station orbiting Earth.  There is no poverty, no disease, no crime and life is good.  Each home comes equipped with a machine that cures any ailment including those still fatal on Earth.  Earth, or at least Los Angeles - it is the only place depicted - has devolved into a cesspool of poverty and lawlessness.  The planet is in ruins, but people still strive to survive and hope one day to make it to Elysium, the name for the space station.<br /><br />Max (Matt Damon) is just a regular guy and one of the lucky ones to have a job.  He makes the military robots that keep order on Earth for the Elysium politicians.  Max (Mad?) is accidentally exposed to a lethal dose of radiation and given 5 days to live.  Desperate, he accepts an offer from one of his old criminal allies named Spider (Wagner Moura) that will get him to Elysium for a cure.  After a grueling medical/mechanical operation, Max is equipped with an exoskeleton and brain implant that increases his physical strength and hopefully will allow him to download a station reboot program from the top programmer.  Don't ask.<br /><br />The program is meant for the evil secretary of defense, Delacourt (Jodie Foster).  Much has been made of Foster's accent which appears to be part French and part South African, but who cares.  Its 141 years in the future.  In L. A. they're speaking a combination of Spanish and English.  Let's move on.  Getting in Max's way is a henchman of Delacourt played by Blomkamp's buddy and the star of \\"District 9\\", Sharlto Copley.<br /><br />While \\"Elysium\\" falls short of \\"District 9,\\" the flaws are not fatal.  Still, it would be interesting to know if all the other major cities/countries are like L. A. I also wondered how the world got to where they are today.  The film is beautifully shot with some chuckle-worthy product placements.  The wealthy program writer (William Fichtner) is transported between worlds in his black and red Bugatti space buggy.  Secretary Delacourt sports a nifty Bvlgary watch.  If anything Blomkamp is even more in-your-face with his politics.  While \\"District 9\\" was certainly an unveiled parable of apartheid, \\"Elysium\\" takes a broader stab at privilege with health care concerns a critical plot element.  \\"Elysium\\" is a good looking movie that moves right along with some cool action sequences.an of Delacourt played by Blomkamp's buddy and the star of \\"District 9\\", Sharlto Copley.<br /><br />While \\"Elysium\\" falls short of \\"District 9,\\" the flaws are not fatal.

B00DHNBPA6|1.0|I expected it to be a little gross, but it was just over the top and not scary at all. I get it was based on an old movie, but never having seen it, I couldn't stomach it. Stoker was better in the first 10 min than this entire movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|Sexy, fun, thrilling, OH did I mention sexy!! You won't forget it. Christian Grey is a girl's dream. Strong, commanding, and forceful. SEXY!!!!!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Half the time when i have my Kindle fire in my hands, i'm playing this game. It is so addictive and fun! Its good excersize for the brain!
B008AVXGA2|5.0|What a wonderful adaptation of the children's fairy tale from Russia. The Firebird has always been one of my favourites so I was a little apprehensive about reading Julia Gousseova's adaptation. Boy was I wrong! This adaptation is not only wonderful for children, who are the main target of the story's interest, but also for adults.<br />Her simple and direct, concise and lyrical delivery make this for an easy and most enjoyable read.<br />I look forward to reading her other stories. Recommended.<br />By W.M.Laissue author of Whispers Among The Jasmine
B001NLKZUA|5.0|awesome book i loved reading it and the series too. Cant wait for the final book to come out and about to start her others.
B00AL6T0N6|5.0|A delightful tale that captures the seasons. Once again Alex and Katie go on an adventure in Russian fables and end up with Father Frost and the Twelve Seasons.<br />Never a dull moment in this fable, the gracious seasons show their own letting the reader reflect upon the changes of the earth year after year. Kindness is the virtue to be learned in all Russian tales and this one encapsulates mother earth along with it.<br />I am truly hooked on the authors adaptations of these fables. A must read for children and adults alike. Recommended.<br />Review by W.M. Laissue author of Whispers among the Jasmine
B001NLL93W|5.0|awesome book i loved reading it and the series too. Cant wait for the final book to come out and about to start her others.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|Having just seen &#34;Django Unchained&#34;, one of the funniest most violent movies I have ever seen, &#34;Rango&#34; was the perfect complement as they both have 'down and out' protagonists that survive and prevail against all odds. They would be the perfect gift to give to friend who has seen neither. How about offering them up as a set?
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|awesome book i loved reading it and the series too. Cant wait for the final book to come out and about to start her others.
B00C7E3EFU|3.0|I actually bought this new Shout Factory release of \\"The Fog\\" to replace my older 2009 Shout Factory blu-ray (all-region) release because this was advertised by Amazon as having a \\"New 1080p High-Definition Transfer Supervised By Cinematographer Dean Cundey.\\" However, this new blu-ray transfer has the exact same defect 90 seconds into the movie as the previous 2009 transfer, so either someone is lying or Cinematographer Dean Cundey sucks at supervising film transfers. Either way, the quality of this new transfer is no better than the previous, DVD-quality blu-ray release from Shout Factory. Consequently, if you already have the previous release, you should save your money. But, if you don't already have this classic John Carpenter film on blu-ray or DVD, it is an obvious must-have for any horror fan.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|awesome book i loved reading it and the series too. Cant wait for the final book to come out and about to start her others.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game is lots of fun for the relaxed mode player. I like the freedom of choosing my own options Nd and love the tons of game board choices.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I wish the first two books had developed a storyline as well as this one , not that this this was great but at least beliveable
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Addicting.. I loved this game as a kid, love it as an adult. I like being able to play online as well.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|It's a good drama, which is what you want to watch when you want to see a Drama.  Gory surgery for those who like that.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Good game. After you finish story (kind of short to me since I'm a addict to this game and Spiderman) you can purchase the black suit. You can still fight free radicals and deadbeats
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was one of the most absorbing and entertaining puzzle games I have ever played on a tablet. I cannot wait for the next edition - now please.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am sorry to have missed these episodes when on TV.  Thoroughly enjoyed watching and getting updated on the series.
0553384775|1.0|The author took a fairly interesting story and ruined it with his aimless run-on commentary and stupid jokes. Jordan was a conniving, shrewed business man but hes a bad story teller. There were times where i felt blocks of pages were written by 21-year-old frat guy. Anyway, i was very excited for this book but by page 100, i knew i had made a bad choice. Dont do the same.
B001NA6096|4.0|Great film about randomness and possibilities of what can happen. Great scenery - walking through the street.  Felt like you were there with them strolling along.  I liked it that  it covered such a short period of time. There they were, at the edge, beginning of there lives when possibilities are all open
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app does what I need it to do. I find it helpful when I travel. I have not had any problems with it.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|What was the point of this one? Nothing happened, sort of boring. Perhaps just a development of the relationship. Needs a plot or some sort of suspense
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The neurosurgeon's account tallied with others' experiences.  Confirmed what I believe that heaven is really another dimension.  I loved it!
B008JFLWLE|5.0|A great product....worth every penny, even though its free! Bought for my fourth grader to use as a check on her work and she loves it
B00006AG5N|5.0|All the major hits are here -- including &#34;Wooden Heart&#34; -- which still is one of my favorites.  One can never go wrong with Elvis' hits.
B000VI6T6K|5.0|My husband is a very big Jimi Hendrix fan and he loved this! It went great with his collection. Good price too.
B00CFO7PK2|2.0|I was disappointed when I heard the album.  Not much in here.  Too much screaming sometimes.  The choice of music is not my type.
B009YMKL4A|5.0|Great movie. Really excited about this prequel and all the other xmen movies. Recommend this movie especially because days of future past is coming next year

B00A8OWOSO|3.0|Kinda hard to follow the plot.<br />It was hard to figure out which side of the law he was on.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|great disk & songs. will listen to the next albums of stone & sour !!!<br />you will be happy with it.
B0019IB0II|4.0|Liked this book - clearly defines the functions of left and right brain for anyone who didn't know- encouraging story of her recovery
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Takes you have to 1950-60' a litter slow, but fun just the same. Takes skill to know where to place the coins.
0316247545|5.0|With facts from the artist and writers themselves.  They even have their blueprints of ponies.  With fun lyrics and songs.<br />I recommend for 5 yrs old and any other age.  Includes the legend and funny scripts on the front page and back.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun to play!  We really enjoy this game and it always works great. The minions are adorable and funny! Touchdown!

B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good action comedy, definitely a cheesy plot line, but very entertaining. Good image quality on the streaming side with this rental.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I loved it the first time, and still cried at the end of seeing it the second time. My son loved it too.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|This DVD is a perfect family situation.  It is true, it is clean for the whole family.  It shows love, tenderness, togetherness, courage, bravery,and fun.  A bit of everything.  My husband and I saw it at the theater and I knew immediately it was a keeper and I had to have a copy of it.  I would and have recommended this to anyone seeking a very enjoyable time.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I liked it until it started failing as if it were not connected to internet. I used it for mail, and after a few times that it complained it could not connect to the server, I just removed it and went to google.com.
B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|This is a very sweet movie.  It is touching, it is funny, it is very enjoyable and I like that it is clean..fit for younger people as well as us old folks.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I loved this series and I don't understand way there was no 2nd season. I am a huge sci fi fan
B000683VI4|5.0|This is an excellent movie and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know what real love is.  It is tender lover with consistancy.  A love that endures all the hardships life may throw at a person.  It shows that if you truly love someone, nothing can change it.  That's something almlost f orgotten these days.
B001AQO400|4.0|Murray at his best, playing opposite a very sexy ScarJo. The best scene is the karaoke scene...Murray sings Elvis Costello, amongst others.
080017948X|3.0|I did not particularily care for this movie, but my husband loves it.  Therefore, I watch it from time to time with him.  If it makes him happy, I am happy.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I personally did not listen to this album, but my girlfriend requested for Christmas last year. She loves it. She keeps in her car during Christmas time, and plays it on her way to work.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I have had a lot of issues with it. First one, the battery lasted less than 2 days, Withings replaced it promptly. The second one has much better battery life. It also seems to be fairly accurate in the steps counting. The elevation feature doesn't work very well at all, I did a hike with over 1000 vertical feet, pretty intense at 4 MPH, and it said I had something like 9 feet... Withings assures me the elevation algorithm will be better with the next firmware update, when I don't know. It has to be fairly difficult to make that accurate with no altimeter. A combination of an altimeter and the accelerometer so it doesn't give you elevation for riding an elevator or escalator would probably be better.<br /><br />No integration with Walgreens steps program, like their scales have. Still a young product. Hoping for great improvement in the near future.<br /><br />Sleep monitor & pulse check seem to be pretty accurate as well. If the elevation bug was fixed, I would give it 4-5 stars.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|i read the book and like always, movies aren't as good, but loved the movie anyways. definitely a must watch
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|brilliant book from start to finish couldnt leave it down.  kept me guessing till the end.  enjoyable read recommend it
B00DFFHUUA|5.0|Action and adventure abound. Enjoyed everyone . Bruce and Dwayne thank you for the entertainment. I would recommend this to everyone.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The acting is top noch.<br />The filming makes NYC look beautiful in every direction.<br />The dialogue is the best feature of this show.<br />The repartee between the two lead actors should carry this show for many seasons to come!
B005NFVZTM|4.0|The way their origins were discovered was masterfully portrayed. I really enjoyed how the young man became the Beast. I really wanted to give this movie 4 1/2 stars.
1407130293|4.0|I personally bought the book set but my daughter is the one that read the books.  She was pleased with the delivery time and such, but not crazy about book #3.
B007REW8DO|5.0|Love her voice and her arrangements.  I look forward to hearing more of her.  I am sorry I missed her when she was touring with Jason Mraz.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app! Love playing anywhere and everywhere!!! Fun for all ages and love color graphics!! Perfect challenge for my brain!
B0013FNC38|4.0|I love Jason Mraz.  I wish I discovered him before he became so popular so I could've seen him live in a smaller setting.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining! I really enjoy it!  Great job! It is challenging without being too hard.love it
B005K17RU0|4.0|For some reason, the Weather Channel went blank, so I installed AccuWeather.  I'm having a hard time getting used to it, but I didn't like the changes made on the Weather Channel either, so it's probably just me.  I do like AccuWeather's compact info, all just a swipe away, without having to click on things that take me to another planet!
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|From what I've read about the true story- it sounds like it would have made a more compelling story- this one seems a bit too contrived but enjoyed the costumes and set designs. The movie skipped and stuttered and had to be restarted 4 times- Amazon gave me a credit and offered to make sure my new Smart TV is set-up correctly even though the Netflix movie I streamed the night before was fine.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Where is the third book, first two are very good but the author is taking forever to publish. Nice books
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Even better than season one!  A very well done series....filmed mostly on location in Croatia and Iceland....just gorgeous.  Can't wait to watch Season 3!
B00AL1P9PY|1.0|All I wanted to do is download the mp3 version of this album to my computer, but Amazon forces you to download their cloud player which you can only use when connected to the internet. It's a lot more time and effort than I expected, and will never buy another mp3 from Amazon. There has got to be an easier way!
B00C1S945G|4.0|Well written, acting was good. The actors chosen for different parts was excellent.  I enjoyed the science technology that is possible in the future.
B00D7JGL36|4.0|arrived well ahead of schedule. great price and I love the music. Not a big fan of the original artist however Vince Gill is one of the best performers in any genre. Paul Franklin is unfamiliar to me however he's holding his own with Mr. Gill.  These songs sound better to me than the originals though...no offense...just not a fan of classic country music.
B00005JLIU|2.0|Not as good as the Broadway play! Lost interest but did see to end! Might leave this on the shelf for a while!!
B004XZR63M|5.0|It is a great book that shows the difference between his dad (Poor Dad) and his friend's dad  (Rich Dad).  He explains the choices from his youth to the present day.  It was well written and  interesting.
B005544V6A|5.0|Love the show - love the interaction of the experienced and the rookie. Love how well the rookie is mentored.

B005CMSDLE|5.0|This movie kept my attention!! Great suspense and story line! Where the bad guys are really, really bad! Definitely one I will rewatch many times in the future...
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This is the best movie Liam Neeson has made in a long time.<br />Well worth a watch with almost constant action.
0545128285|5.0|This book is super fun to read, very easy but I think most Harry Potter fans out there just need to have it on principle!  Loved the tale of the three brothers.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I LOVED The Lorax, and yes, I am an ADULT!<br /><br />The Lorax is one of those magical movies (like Shrek or Ice Age) that is great for ALL AGES, from 1 to 101 (and beyond)!!!!  This movie is cute, funny, silly, and VERY colorful!  It also carries a very important environmental message...in a very cute, funny, silly and colorful way, of course!<br /><br />In the movie, a 12 year old boy lives in a plastic world called Thneedville.  He's never even seen a real tree before.  The trees in his town work on batteries!  The boy falls in love with a teenage girl who is into trees, and thus embarks on his adventure to find a real tree....<br /><br />This movie is never boring due to it's fast paced crazy silly style.......it's also not obnoxious in that new age way that so many movies fall into.  The graphics are great!  The characters are all unique and engaging, and the ending will make you happy.  You will be smiling all day after watching this movie!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie for ANYONE...especially if you have young children, they will LOVE it!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This app works very well on my Samsung Galaxy S3. Flipboard is a wonderful portal that allows you to view & discover the information you're looking for.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|Terrible waste of time. And it took like three hours. They could have done so much better. Michael Bay, you ruined transformers.

B0090SI4LU|3.0|It was a very boring movie.  I really expected much more from the writer. Loved the Twilight series.  This one fell way short.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|this game sucks I deleted every game I had and there still was not enough room don't spend your money on it. IT SUCKS!!!!
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|This book is an uplifting story of a woman who died and came back with a wealth of knowledge.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is experiencing death, whether it be themselves or a loved one. I no longer fear &#34;the great beyond&#34;.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|The movies characters are top notch as listed, but as in a few other movies the growing trend is to put the big names on the cover then have them play a minimal role for only a short bit of play time, then they are no longer in the entirety of the rest of the film. Very frustrating!! When we look for movies to watch there are a few steps to our selection process. First we see the title, then we see who is in it (actors & actresses), then the theme of the film lastly. So even a bad action movie with the right characters can be a great flick. However , a action movie is just an action movie without the right actors & actresses to play the great roles to make the movie great, follow my thinking?! So see for yourselves, if you leave thinking (WTF?!) like I did then you get where I am coming from, if not then good for you! It would seem as though they did this very recently with the same person in another film of late too, with the same result in my eyes anyway! You see if you feel the same though, let me know. Otherwise, I liked it. However it could have been so much better had they left people in place as they used to.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|A great plot. Kept me in suspense. Entertaining. Matthew McConaughey was perfect for this part. Like the ending as the story and plot unraveled.
B008JFUN50|5.0|It is amazing what can AK47 do 140 years from now! Hmm, you don't really have to pay $7.75 to see non-citizens being shot from a helicopter, but if you didn't wake up yet, this movie may help you.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Just makes you want to LOVE the Queen. She dose have a heart when everyone thought she did not have one
B00003CXAA|4.0|Great price for this complete set. Have been looking to own this for a long time but could never find it at a reasonable price before.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|The characters are so believable and not perfect, but likeable. Can't wait to get started on Season 2! So much better than Downton Abbey

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Such a wonderful game. Great graphics. Amazing story line. This game is captivating you will never get bored. Definately worth buying it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Hey guys.<br />  I gave this app a 3star rating because at first it is really fun but after about a week or so, it gets kinda boring. I WOULD still recommend this app though, because we all should know that not ALL free apps are great . This would be one of them. But Don't leave bad reviews for any free app because remember nobody's perfect.
B005SCSL56|4.0|This is a great story for my elementary library.  It has two kids in fairytale land trying to gather items from various fairytale characters so they can get back home. This is a great read aloud!
B001O8D47S|4.0|This was a great modern day remake of the original The<br />Women , did a wonderful job of staying with no men in it, only complaint is not enough comic relief which in original was Rosland Russell.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazing! I know it is 7 bucks but it is worth it. Really I'm not kidding it's good plus do not buy blockcraft it's horrible well bye
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good game, doesn't move along too slowly, by dragging out the hints, don't like the fact that you have to upgrade to get the entire game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best series in a long time. Very rich story (or rather stories). Gives you a glimpse of what it meant to live among British aristocracy at the beginning of the 20th century.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I have had these headphones for 5 years! I use them every day. They are still in like new condition. They have great sound quality. I have had no problems with them. The people who have said bad things about these headphones must not have gotten these headphones or are horrible owners. I have had these for half of a decade and have had no problems. I HIGHLY recommend these headphones.

B009VSW15Y|1.0|this app is a waste of time, the kindle's cam quality is awful and no app will change that .
B004UNX1LS|4.0|This is a very nice way to find music you like.  My husband showed me this app.  It has something for everyone and has a search tool so you can find what/who you like and see the video.  Lots of hours of fun!
B009R659L8|5.0|I loved this book as I love all your books. A good mystery and best of all they're clean and not a lot of bad language. I would recommend it to anyone
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|A seriously solid, groove-driven rock album from 3 amazingly talented guys. Just saw them live and they are even better in person.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great story<br />Great suspense<br />Dark comedy<br />I was skeptical at first, but after the first episode I knew it was going to be good.<br />Far beyond my expectations.<br />I'm excited to buy the second season and waiting for the third season in October!
0451417704|5.0|This \\"techno-thriller\\" novel is a conversation-starter and that's why it appeals as I am involved in a new effort to rein in the kind of technology that Dan Suarez warns of in \\"Kill Decision.\\" Our campaign seeks the adoption of an international treaty that would require human beings are always \\"in-the-loop\\" or meaningfully involved in decisions to select target and engage or use force. This review looks at the real-world lessons provided by Kill Decision.<br /><br />In his book Suarez imagines a world where drones are no longer controlled by humans, but instead are fully autonomous.  It may be a work of fiction, but, as other reviewers have noted, is based on solid research. Suarez is not only a best-selling author, but a technical expert who has spent years developing software and database systems, including for the defense industry.<br /><br />He is concerned with \\"autonomous combat drones\\" that would \\"fly themselves and make a kill decision without human involvement.\\" The drones that Suarez warns against in Kill Decision are \\"autonomous--programmed to find and kill their victim, and then to self-destruct.\\" He depicts the many dangers that armed drones could pose if this technology is not checked and permitted to become fully autonomous. The opening chapter, entitled \\"Boomerang,\\" depicts a nightmare scenario of an unidentified and uncontrollable US Reaper drone malfunctioning over a religious shrine packed with pilgrims and launching missile strikes before it self-destructs, causing multiple casualties in the process.<br /><br />Odin, the main male character, is a US soldier working for a secret government agency who is tasked with identifying who is behind a wave of terrorist bombings on US soil that turn out to be a series of anonymous drone attacks. Early on Odin observes that armed autonomous drones would be \\"a revolution in military affairs\\" as they would \\"combine all the worst aspects of cyber war--anonymity and scalability--with the physical violence of kinetic war.\\"<br /><br />The main female character is Professor Linda McKinley, a \\"myrmecologist\\" or scientist who studies ants, specifically weaver ants, apparently one of the most war-like species on earth. Throughout her career McKinley says she has repeatedly turned down military-funded research grants so she is horrified to learn about the development of a new military technology that seeks to \\"imbue a machine with the mind of a weaver ant.\\"<br /><br />In Kill Decision, Suarez depicts swarms of small autonomous drones designed to cut through metal and the closing chapters of the book are a rollercoaster ride as the two heroes try to stop a swarm of hundreds of thousands of metal-eating drones that are cutting ships apart and demolishing their contents.<br /><br />Suarez proposes that \\"cheaper, more manoeuvrable, and expendable\\" autonomous drones could completely alter modern warfare. Throughout Kill Decision, he warns against their proliferation or an arms race as dozens of countries and private companies rush to develop of autonomous armed drones. He is also troubled with who could own autonomous armed drones and the idea that they could \\"be quietly controlled by a small number of unaccountable people.\\"<br /><br />Suarez presents an imaginary US government position that requires \\"there's always a human involved in the loop to make what they call the `kill decision' - whether to shoot or not.\\" This book was published in July 2012, only five months before the real Pentagon issued its first-ever policy directive on autonomy in warfare requiring the Department of Defense to do exactly that by permitting fully autonomous weapons systems that only deliver non-lethal force.<br /><br />But unlike legislation, policy can be challenged and changed therefore Suarez asserts that new law is necessary to address the dangers of war by fully autonomous weapons. Kill Decision describes the need for \\"an international legal framework on the proliferation and use of lethally autonomous robots.\\"<br /><br />Suarez therefore welcomed the April 2013 launch of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a new international civil society coalition coordinated by Human Rights Watch that seeks to prevent the creation of the weapons he warns about in Kill Decision.<br /><br />In his July 2013 TED Global talk in Edinburgh, Suarez urged his audience to make sure that autonomous armed drones \\"remain fiction\\" by banning their development and deployment. Through his work and his public statements, this fiction writer has joined a new movement concerned with preventing the real and not fictional threat of fully autonomous weapons.<br /><br />Readers who found this novel \\"scary\\" or \\"terrifying\\" should not hesitate to channel that fear into positive action by supporting Suarez's call for a ban on fully autonomous weapons and joining the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Good game but it sucks you only get a few at a time. I wish you could play unlimited. All in all it is very fun and has good graphics.
B00499NHLC|2.0|We seem to be in a time rich with Sherlock spinoffs. This one is not nearly as interesting as &#34;elementary&#34;
B0086700CM|5.0|I looooooooooooooooooooooooveI love it and I hggot offered usain bolt lmao I love  this game app much it's cool colic ills Iloilo cool cool cool cool<br />LO
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story, settings, and lives of the people are engrossing. I am particularly impressed at the level of acting that makes it seem as if these people are not acting, but really there in that time.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|FourPlay is one of the premier jazz groups of today.  I would highly recommend this CD to all true jazz lovers.
B005UG53NS|5.0|I have read all the books ( Bloomsbury edition), and seen all the films.  While I like the first HP film the best for its innocence and youthful approach, this darker final chapter of good versus evil is quite powerful.  And Ralph Fines (not to slight the others, though) was just magnificent as the Dark Lord.
B00133KHCY|5.0|Best Movie that we have watched for a long time and I recomend it to everyone. We tell all our friends about it.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|I liked it for its portrayal of what might have happened to the man who became the wizard and the plotting the two wicked witches used to get what they wanted. Happy ending too. I like that.
0062255657|4.0|A quick read, very refreshing to see a new plot for a change.  Neil does great work, bringing a new point of view to otherwise old concepts.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|This app works fine. However, I have several devices on which I read Kindle books, and this Android app doesn't synchronize my notes and highlights. With my other devices, I can annotate a sentence and view that annotation on other devices. Not so with this Android app. Annotations I add on it do not appear on any other device.
B004UO0SAO|5.0|This is excellent.  Only minor issues are the somewhat unfamiliar keyboard layout (I'm familiar these days with the 11C) and the slightly non-intuitive and terse help function.
0865479410|5.0|I'm too cynical for self-help books.  And I've noticed, people who consume them regularly seem to get a short-term boost, but never any lasting benefit. (IMO)<br /><br />This book not only explains why that is so, but also provides a functional alternative, delving into Stoicism and Buddhism for its framework.  I was already influenced by Buddhist thinking, but this book delivers it in a way that is useful to everyone.<br /><br />I can't summarize the book in any way that would do it justice.  But I do recommend it.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I didn't want to invest in an expensive cover for my new Kindle Fire HD, so I opted for the Belkin Classic case.<br />It is durable, looks stylish (though not flashy) and protects my newest investment.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|The formatting isn't the best, but you can understand and read it. I wouldn't recommend the novel unless you are a good reader. It is definitely a tough book in the beginning. A lot of the other reviews said the book was boring and whoever wrote those reviews made the same mistake I did when I was in middle school and tried to read the Count of Monte Cristo. This book is a classic and should be read slowly and carefully to get the full effect.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I am not a big fan of sci-fi movies and The Wachowskis.<br /><br />Matrix was only a mashup of their commercial gimmicks learned.<br /><br />After buying this blu ray, I continued to push the day to watch, anxious that I would be disappointed.<br /><br />Well, I was wrong.  It is one of the specatcular movies I have ever seen.  Ok it is confusing but the entertainement value is so good that you just overlook its shortcomings.<br /><br />The make-up staff have done a fantastic job of disguising characters that for once, it is very very convincing.<br /><br />This is one of the films that I would never put up on Ebay
