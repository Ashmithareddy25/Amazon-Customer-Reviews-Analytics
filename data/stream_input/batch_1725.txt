B007SGLZP8|2.0|As usual, Grisham can weave a tale, but seems to get tired of the story at the end. Maybe he has fulfilled the number of words or pages required by the publisher? There are surprises, but the writing is stilted and choppy.  I stopped reading Brisbane, now I remember why.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a well written, very personal story of a neurosurgeon's near death experience. In addition to his experience while in a coma with a one-off form of bacterial meningitis there is his experience in locating his birth parents and family that he didn't know existed. All in all a great read. I highly recommend it to everyone.
0920668372|5.0|My oldest son (36) gave me this book about 5yrs. ago for Mothers Day, He wrote inside it \\"This is my story for you\\" I started reading it in front of everyone and it was all I could do to hold back the tears. When I got home I did cry when I read it again and every time I pick it up to read again I cry. I have bought 4 in the last year or so to give to new Mothers. I love this book!

B007REV4YI|5.0|\\"Skyfall\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Bond's loyalty to M is tested as her past comes back to haunt her. As MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.<br /><br />The cast led by Daniel Craig (superb in his third-go-round as James Bond), Javier Bardem (in an interestingly, well-crafted performance as Silva) & Judi Dench (great as M) is brilliant. The directing by Sam Mendes is brilliant. The story & screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade & John Logan is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Thomas Newman is brilliant. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is brilliant. The film editing by Stuart Baird is brilliant. The casting by Debbie McWilliams is brilliant. The production design by Dennis Gassner is brilliant. The art direction by Neal Callow, James Foster, Marc Homes, Paul Inglis, Jason Knox-Johnston & Chris Lowe is brilliant. The set decoration by Anna Pinnock, set dressings by James J. Foley & Paul Hearn is brilliant. The costume design by Jany Temime is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Chris Corbould is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Asregadoo Arundi, Angela Barson, Steven Begg, John Paul Docherty, Hugh Macdonald, Steve Moncur, Jonathan Neill & Edson Williams, coordinated by Genevieve Claire, Jack George, James Grummitt, Lisa Kelly, Sara Khangaroot, Emma Moffat, Holly Price, Michelle Rose, Samantha Townend & Mark Webb is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Gary Powell & Fatih Ugurlu, fights coordinated by Nicola Berwick is brilliant.<br /><br />This is another brilliant Bond film in recent memory, ahead of the brilliant \\"Casino Royale\\" and definitely much better than the last Bond film, \\"Quantum Of Solace\\". This is a well-crafted (well-made, as well), fun and entertaining movie that definitely entertains until the very end. Daniel Craig has definitely solidified critics' and audiences' opinions of him with his superb-crafted performance of James Bond in this new outing. Javier Bardem makes an interesting and terrific villain in Silva with a performance that definitely reminds you of his Oscar-winning performance as villain Anton Chigurh in \\"No Country For Old Men\\". Judi Dench also gives a quietly solid performance as M. This is one of the best movies of the holiday season, one of the best action movies of the year and one of the best movies of the year, in general. Adele's beautifully-crafted, Oscar-winning title song, is a Bond theme song would remembering. It also won an Oscar for Best Sound Editing, as well, tied with \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\".
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Being a fan of Kamelot since The Fourth Legacy, I've always loved Kahn's vocal style combined with his undeniable stage presence.  I've also been a fan of Seventh Wonder (Kamelot's new singer, Tommy K.'s previous band), and I'm completely convinced that Kamelot found the perfect replacement for Kahn!  Tommy knocks it out of the park with Silverthorn.<br /><br />After the first listen, I thought the cd was good, but it didn't \\"click\\" yet.  After a few more listens, I was completely BLOWN AWAY!  This cd has so many catchy choruses that you'll be singing the songs all day long.  After about 40 listens, I'm still completely captivated by the talent oozing from this masterpiece.  If you only heard a song once or twice, you probably won't get it.  This is a cd that will grow on you more after each listen.<br /><br />Kamelot really shines once again.  I liked Poetry for the Poisoned, but Silverthorn is a hundred times better.  Silverthorn hasn't left my cd player yet, and it's safe to say it will remain there for a long time. Tommy sounds a lot like Khan in many of the songs, but he also brings something new and fresh to the table.  If you are a Kamelot fan or a metal fan for that matter, this cd is a must.  Kamelot is back folks!  Do yourself a favor, and pick up this cd.  The limited edition with the 2nd cd and storybook is worth every cent.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|I rented this movie and as soon as I finished watching it, I logged onto Amazon to purchase it for my collection and write this review. It's about four police officers and a construction worker and how their roles as husbands and fathers affects the lives of their families. On a daily basis, the policemen deal with troubled individuals who have made bad choices. Statistics show that the vast majority of them have not had the benefit of a good father figure in their lives. You might already think you are a good father, but this movie will inspire you to be the best father you can be to your children. I came away from it with a renewed commitment, even though I'm a grandfather and live several hundred miles from my kids. Both entertaining and inspirational, I highly recommend this movie.

B000SEGUDE|2.0|Mitchell tried too hard to be complicated and confusing, maybe to be considered \\"very brainy\\".  This read was not enjoyable and I actually finished it just to see what it was all about.  The centuries were never labeled which made it more confusing.

B009VB97EY|3.0|Oh my!  I kept hearing about this movie, and being a red-blooded single woman I thought I should probably watch it to see what it's about.  I won't deny there's some eye candy there; in fact it was almost enough to make me overlook the flaws of the movie.  Almost.<br /><br />Magic Mike is the story of a man who works construction by day, builds furniture as a dream, and strips by night.  He's rather successful at it and when he meets a young guy at the construction job, he gives him a shot at the business too.  Mike wants out of the stripping business to have his dream job of running a furniture making business, but his new friend Adam has dove completely into the world of stripping, sordid side jobs and all.  Which causes problems with Adam's sister, who Mike has a crush on and who doesn't approve of the lifestyle at all.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Channing Tatum: Magic Mike<br />Alex Pettyfer: Adam<br />Matthew McConaughey: Dallas<br />Cody Horn: Brooke<br />Joe Manganiello: Richie<br />Matt Bomer: Ken<br />Adam Rodriguez:Tito<br />Kevin Nash: Tarzan<br />Olivia Munn: Joanna<br />Gabriel Iglesias: Tobias<br /><br />I can't say any of the acting was really good in this.  Tatum was probably the best and that's just because I enjoyed his dance moves.  Even McConaughey, who I absolutely loved I just didn't like in this movie.  It could have been his role as a sleazy strip-joint owner, but he didn't even come out as being attractive to me in the role.  He looked used up, which maybe was the point for the movie, but who knows.  Horn as Brooke was not very good either.  It was like taking an awkward teenage girl of the streets and putting her in the movie.  No depth and there wasn't even any chemistry between her and Tatum on screen.  But hey, at least everyone was a pretty person.<br /><br />The plot; well there's not much I can say about the plot because it didn't really have one.  I wish they would have just left it as dancing and the strip scenes because when they tried to make it more meaningful than that, it was boring and contrived.  There were some stories about drugs and a little bit of flirting between Mike and ADam's sister, but  I didn't buy into the side plots at all and let's face it, people came to watch a movie about strippers, they probably don't care one lick about the plot so don't pretend to have one.  In fact, I would have been satisfied if it was just the stripping part; although I do realize I may have had to go to another store to purchase that dvd.  But anyways...<br /><br />The music and dancing in this movie is why it gets as high as three stars from me.  It was pretty fantastic and they did some great choreographing.  Tatum especially was impressive.  I really didn't know guys could move like that.  And yes the dancing was technically erotic, but there are impressive moves in that type of dancing as well.  You have to be athletic to do it well.  The music was mostly dance/club music and fit well with the movie.  And this should go without saying, but this is a movie about strippers, there is nudity, sex, cussing, some violence, and pretty much everything you can think of.  Not for children.<br /><br />An ok movie.  I realize my hormones are probably making me rate it higher than it deserves. But hey, sometimes you're allowed to have brain candy, and that is perfectly fine.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012ried to make it more meaningful than that, it was boring and contrived.

0785163174|3.0|The reviews for this story have been spot on, even the higher grade reviews revealed the flaws in the story. The writers of the book are some of my favorite, but this was a story where \\"The end justified the means\\", where they wanted to mix-up the teams and start fresh and worked backwards to get to that point. I no longer read individual issues, I just buy trades and hardcovers. I'm behind on the latest Avengers and X-Men, but was excited to purchase this book so that it would set up Marvel Now and the new teams. THere were 12 issues in the main story, but not much story really happened and at the end, things kind of went back to normal. I don't blame all the writers, because likely they were told to tell this story, and they did the best they could. If you want to read a more exciting divisional story, read Schism by Jason Aaron, it was the book that got me back into X-Men after a long hiatus. (I also recommend his Wolverine and X-Men). Civil War, inherently, told a better story, as those issues revolved around the choice between Order (Iron Man) and Freedom (Captain America). Here, the story involved protecting Hope Summers (and I didn't know who she was either) and the Phoenix Force. It was clear from the outset, as anyone who has ever read an X-Men book, the Phoenix Force is bad. A bunch of people die, but I can't really tell if they actually die, or they will come back. (And the big character that dies, I'm pretty sure they had already died a few times before). If you really want to read this book, I think you should purchase a chapter version when it comes in TPB, and just read Avengers v. X-Men, the versus books don't add anything. I also think you can likely read Marvel Now without reading this book at all.<br /><br />Other pet peeves, lots of dialogue, not always clear on the story or location. The art was good in some places, but seemed that everything was rushing to a deadline.<br /><br />Here are some nitpicks -- where was the rest of the Marvel Universe, e.g. Fantastic Four, when this story was going on?<br /><br />Note to Marvel, perhaps you don't need the big stories every two years.<br /><br />I still think there was a more organic way of accomplishing your story than how it was done.<br /><br />So note to potential buyers, if you're buying for Amazon price of $40, I still wait for TPB. I don't think there are that many changes that you need to read this book. If you're a kid, you may like the fighting scenes more.  But they X-Men have done the hero turns bad for a long time, and I thought pretty successfully with the alter reality of Age of Apocalypse and when Xavier merged with Magneto, oh yeah, and the original Dark Phoenix.<br /><br />At full retail price, $75, there are so many better stories that you should buy first, many by the authors who wrote these books.<br /><br />Note, upon a night's sleep, I changed my review from 2 stars to 3 stars. I think the story is average. Not horrible. I consider keeping only 4 and 5 star books. If you have unlimited space and are a completist, and have unlimited cash, then buy the hard cover edition.

B002RI9ZPY|5.0|This book keeps fighting back! The plot is fascinating and the characters are many layered. It is not a book for the squeamish, but would probably appeal to the fans of QuentinTaranteno or the Train spotting -type films. Its such an entertaining and fast read. The plot is unpredictable and clever. Its got such a lot of style.
0143037757|5.0|I've read quite a few history text books in my life, always grumbling about how historians should be required to take creative writing classes. This book (FINALLY!) marries the wonderfulness of history with grippingly appealing writing. It is literally, a page turner. In his introduction, author Tony Judt actually states that goal--to write a history book that is (essentially) fun to read--and he has been absolutely successful. Not to mention, he has included information that I've never before come across, though had an sense that it existed. Buy this book, read it, and love it!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book was a good summary about the SEALS and their missions to protect us all. The author not only related the story about killing OBL but also gave us an inside look into the lives of the SEALS. His details about the actual kiling of OBL were spell-binding. Now I have a better idea about the lives of our military heroes and respect them even more. A read for all Americans so as to better appreciate our fighting men and women.
159420411X|4.0|We are, by now, accustomed to books promising unorthodox or hyper-elegant explanations for worldly phenomenons. The Freakonomics guys and Malcolm Gladwell have sold millions of books supposedly unlocking the mysteries behind everything from abortion rates to the success of The Beatles. Now comes Nate Silver's contribution to the genre, an exhaustive analysis of the science of predictions. There are two distinctions that I think are a credit to Silver. He integrates his own story, his biography, with his analysis, to interesting effect. Nate Silver has become the world's unlikeliest celebrity, after having predicted 99 out of 100 state results in the last two Predidential elections. Everyone loves a success story. (Gladwell wrote a whole book on this subject). The journey from anonymous geek to cult figure to celebrity seer of all things political is interesting. That same story from the point of view of a lightningrod for firece debate and high profile dissention is irresistible. It's not the Nate is right (he is, seemingly always), but that so many other celebrities from the political arena proclaim him so very wrong, dismiss his methods as nonsense, and ridicule the precision of his mathematics -- all the way up until the moment he is proved right. The other distinction of course is that his methods are not controversial or even so much open to debate. They are mathematical and scientific - they can be proven to a degree of probabilistic certainty. The book doesn't seek to profit from surprise, unscientific conclusions: i.e, more abortions equal less crime! The Beatles are great because they played endless gigs in gritty Hamburg clubs! Silver's book is based on a world where 2 + 2 will always equal 4, and the chances of a 80% free throw shooter at the height of his career missing 5 free throws in a row can be quantified to a hundred thousandth of a percent. What Silver's book lacks in drama is made up for in logical sense. It helps us respect the world as less random and less inexplicable than many would have us (or want us to) believe. It's no wonder he's a target for pundits everywhere.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Typical Nelson DeMille.  Strong warrier male, John Cory, but also a strong warrier female, his wife Kate. I love John's wisecracks and his and Kate's patriot spirit. It's a good story for today. Scary because so much of it reads true. This is another of Nelson's can't-put-down reads.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It's a kind of quirky as a supernatural comedy but it was kind of lacking in the comedy department to me. Well worth watching as a Saturday afternoon popcorn muncher.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is good to see the main charactor in the story that was wronged by the justice system, get back his life and \\"one up\\" the system.
1781161097|2.0|Although I had high hopes for this film being coined \\"The Movie Event of the Year\\", I was some what disappointed with the final outcome. I was even more disappointed with the book in review. The Art of the Film really leaves much to be desired. There is simply not enough depth or art work to really appreciate what Prometheus essentially really is - a big film with big ideas. It would have been more interesting if there were more behind the scenes imagery of the artwork that never made it to the final film.
B009DH371K|5.0|The people who criticised  this Blu-ray disc for not including the full show as presented on the accompanying 2-CD set(I bought the Blu-ray + 2-CD set) have failed to read the booklet. The raw, uncut camera negative no longer exists. For \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\", \\"Hello Mary Lou\\" & \\"(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care\\" (if they were filmed), the film footage no longer exists.<br /><br />My question concerns a new variation of DTS-HD Master Audio that is used on this disc. It is \\"DTS-HD High Res Audio\\". When played on my Oppo BDP-83 disc player(playing through an Integra DHC 9.9 A/V Processor), the audio is played as 4.0 audio(the subwoofer & center channel are silent). Has anyone else experienced this issue?
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I know very little about baseball, but I don't consider this a baseball book.  I consider it a book on making data-driven business decisions and organizational change, and baseball just happens to be the place where that happens.  I also saw the movie and enjoyed it.  The book expands on the movie and fills in the gaps, which a two-hour movie is going to have. If you enjoyed the movie, I don't believe that will take away from your enjoyment of the book.  If you read the book, I believe you'll still enjoy the movie.<br /><br />I read the book on a Kindle.  I first read it through the Kindle loan program, but enjoyed it so much that I ended up buying the book.<br /><br />Even after seeing the movie and reading the book I'm still not a baseball fan.  But I wish I were.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|First of all I am a huge fan of MJ's live performances. I have a total of 7: 2 Bad Tours, 1 Dangerous, and 4 HIStory; and now I have another Bad Tour, Wembley, so a total of 8. And that's not including the concerts with the Jacksons I also have. Now that that's out of the way, the review.<br /><br />This is definitely in the top 3, I could argue top 2, best concerts from him. What makes it that good are the moves: he rarely ever stays still. You cannot take your eyes off the screen for even a few seconds or you'll risk missing a glide, pop, or spin. You can easily see James Brown's influence in this performance. On top of all this he is performing some of his greatest songs: Wanna Be Startin Somethin, Another Part of Me, Human Nature.... and the list goes on.<br /><br />If you are a fan you will own this, it's that simple. If you are not a fan you will be after watching it. Now, off to watch it again.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I think this film is very good. Many people expected to find another Alien movie, but for me it was an explanation to many issues related with the beginning of Alien saga. I think this film could bring more interesting parts to articulate something bigger.<br />The characters on this film are just ok. I can consider is lacking of the strength of Sigourney Weaver character, even though Naomy Rapace is doing his act very well. In the hand David, the android, has a heavy role, and it is played consistently along the movie as a robot should be.<br />Special effects are just great. I've always admired Giger's art. In this movie this art and the music are very important. They are well connected for taking you to an immersive experience.  That is the reason why I titled my review in this way.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|A fantastic story that you can easily lose yourself in for hours, would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who is after an epic fantasy
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is not a movie with Iron Man, Hulk, Batman, Superman, or a the rest of the make believe comic world.  This is gold.  Our best and bravest.  Real sweat, real tears, and real blood.  Not make believe.  The story is a compilation of missions conducted by REAL Navy Seals.  They go down range to protect and defend the United States. By far the best military action movie in years.  Well worth your time.
B009VB97EY|1.0|when i first saw the preveiws I did not know if i was going to like it but after watching it I would never again watch it. The story line was so boring and i felt like they talked so slow to keep the movie going. I love Channing in Step up. But in this movie he was okay. I wish there was more than just the stripping because it seemed to be the only thing in the movie that had some action and nothing else.
B007TK77QE|1.0|After loving the Harry Potter series I was expecting more from J K Rowling.  While I knew this was a more adult book I thought that it would be more interesting than it was.  Over half of the book seemed devoted to introducing the miriade of characters and then hardly anything happened with them.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Wow, I absolutely adore this movie. It mixes action, comedy and heart seamlessly. It may not be for everyone but its my favorite film.
B009KHCT94|5.0|Here we have a satirical film that's irreverent but chock full of random homages and in-jokes. It is definitely amusing and I would recommend everyone watch it.
0345528581|4.0|Mark Lauren is definitely his own gym. It is amazing how easy it is to get an incredible workout in very little time, no matter where you are.  One of the best benefits of using gravity and your own body weight for workouts is how much better this is for developing core strength and balance.  Almost every exercise shown can be made as easy or as challenging as one would like, simply by making a few adjustments. This is a great reference book with plenty of exercises to choose from.  My only knock on the book is that some of the uses of furniture and doors would be unrealistic to use all the time in your own home without ripping your door hinges from the wall or blowing out a bookshelf.  However, the exercises are sound.  Just use good judgement and improvise by using safe and sturdy options around the house, yard, or park.

B00005N6KG|5.0|My husband likes to use these while running, as the ear buds tend to fall out of his ears with too much motion.  My son likes to use his with his LeapPad.  The arching head part is extremely flexible, and my two-year-old can pull them by one end out of the desk, while the entire thing straightens completely out, without damaging them at ALL.  I have never heard any wire-related static, nor problems with the jack, and they are labeled L and R for correct placement.  They are very simple, very lightweight, and a really good deal for something you can actually wad up in a gym bag every once in a while without problem.
B005J39FAY|3.0|Rather disappointed with the kindle format.  Instead of the landscape orientation (iPad) making the pictures larger it put two very small pages on one. Given that the pictures are an important part of this book this was surprising.

B007REV4T8|5.0|\\"Skyfall\\" is a great action film that has the James Bond character coming back to help save Great Britain's M16 agency.  Other key players play a strong role in the outcome of Bond's mission with performances by Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Judi Dench, Ben Wishaw, and Rory Kinnear.  Javier Bardem plays a key part in shaping Bond's character growth.  Then you have the Bond character skillfully expressing the romantic charmer archetype with Eve Moneypenny (played by Naomie Harris) and Severine (played by Berenice Marlohe).  There were other actors  (too numerous to mention) that also played an important part in the professional objectives to Bond's character.  \\"Skyfall\\" is great if you like any of the James Bond films or any other action films.

B005LAIIDU|5.0|\\"Wreck It Ralph\\" combines theme elements from both the Megamind movie and Candyland game but creates a plot unique for the main message of \\"Wreck It Ralph\\".  The \\"Wreck it Ralph\\" character plays a person who only wants to break out of the rut of being misunderstood and transform into a dynamic character that is respected and appreciated by others.  However, the character of Wreck It Ralph unintentionally goes about it in an extreme way and causes the other game players into being forced to intervene before it is too late. \\"WrecK It Ralph\\" is great for anyone who enjoys animated films and/or positive feel good movies such as \\"Megamind.\\"

I also like that his choice of music collaborations are eclectic and work with the theme of the songs.  I was lucky to have already been acquainted with his music because of his work with Kylie Minogue on her \\"X\\" cd.  He has also worked with Neyo and Rihanna for \\"We Found Love\\" and \\"Let's Go\\" (which are also both on this cd). \\"Feel So Close\\", \\"Bounce\\" (featuring Kelis), \\"We'll Be Coming Back\\" (featuring Example), \\"Iron\\" (featuring Nicky Romero), \\"I Need You\\" (featuring Ellie Goulding), and \\"Sweet Nothing\\" (featuring Florence Welch from Florence and The Machine) are all also some of the great songs in this collection.  \\"18 Months\\" by Calvin Harris is a suitable purchase for those who like electronica, trance, and/or dance music.
B008Q09K2U|1.0|So once again we find Amazon selling the Kindle version as more expensive than hardcover or paperback versions of the same book.  And all blamed on the publisher setting the price?  Ae we really meant to believe that Amazon can discount any version but the kindle version?  Maybe I'll just go back to paper.
B000089RVX|4.0|I remember first hearing the \\"Fallen\\" cd by Evanescence around 2003. I was stationed in Japan, living on a ship, and hearing \\"Bring Me To Life\\" countless times by a coworker who seemed to be a fanatic of Evanescence.  Needless to say, when I returned stateside, \\"Bring Me To Life\\" grew on me and my interest piqued even more when I heard more of Evanescence's songs on the radio. Fortunately, my husband bought this cd the same year it came out so there was no need for me to purchase the cd.  I can really say that every song on this cd is good. However, my personal favorites are \\"Everybody's Fool\\", \\"My Immortal\\", \\"Haunted\\",\\"Imaginary\\", \\"Taking Over\\", and \\"My Last Breath\\". \\"Fallen\\" by Evanescence is best for those who like gothic rock, alternative rock, and/or at least four Evanescence songs.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|The Departed was a thrilling movie with excellent acting by Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg and the rest of the cast. Guns, gangs, good cops/bad cops, moles, what more could you ask? The only part I didn't like was the ending. I found it to be an anticlimactic way to end the story (or in flip slang... it was CORNY Ka!)<br /><br />Aside from that, this is worth watching in theatre or getting the dvd.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I had to get reaquainted with the characters from book one. There were so many. I enjoyed the first in the trilogy more than book two.
B000P6PVLC|2.0|After all the hype about Babel, I was truly disappointed. This movie is an exasperatingly conceited new film from Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu. It is well acted and well filmed, but terribly overhyped and totally unreal. It is merely a smartly put together piece of near-nonsense: the kind of artsy, fartsy crap that student filmmakers put together and submit to local film festivals. The storyline is unbelievable and confusing. Three different stories in different parts of the world (Moracco, US/Mexico, Japan) running in parallel with the director's feeble attempt to make the audience believe that they are actually all one story.<br /><br />And what brings these 3 stories together? \\"It is a Winchester hunting rifle which a shepherd in north Africa buys and (rashly) entrusts to his two young sons, telling them to shoot jackals that menace his flock. There are no prizes for guessing if something terrible happens. One tragic shot from this rifle is, as they say, heard around the world. The fate of the shepherd and his boys (Mohamed Akhzam, Boubker Ait El Caid and Said Tarchani) is now welded to that of a desperately unhappy American couple (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett); their terrible situation causes the lives of a brash Mexican guy and his respectable aunt (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal and Adriana Barraza) to go tragically off course and everyone is enigmatically connected to a Japanese widower and his hearing-impaired teenage daughter (Kôji Yakusho and Rinko Kikuchi).\\" quote taken by the review Peter Bradshaw from the Guardian<br /><br />Don't waste your money. This movie blows...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love these books you are hooked from beginning to end. Although I really want to know about peeta I'm glad they found a way to keep katniss alive and gale. But the question still lingers who will she choose gale or peeta?
B000OLRH10|4.0|In the  middle of the chaos and civil war that crippled Sierra Leone in the 1990s, \\"Blood Diamond\\" is the story of Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), an ex-mercenary from Zimbabwe, and Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), a Mende fisherman.<br /><br />A thriller with a strong human element--a story that exposes the ugly reality of the diamond industry. Blood Diamond takes us to the ground where War lords enlist children to be their soldiers and men to be their slaves. DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, an unsavory diamond smuggler, whose paths cross with Solomon Vandy, a simple fisherman and a reporter (played by Jennifer Connelly). His world turns upside when he lets his conscience get the better of himself and once selfish unlawful criminal, now becomes the reluctant hero.  DiCaprio gives an amazing performance--truly one of his best roles I've seen yet.  I liked the movie so much that I own the dvd.<br /><br />I give Blood Diamond 4/5 stars.
B009A9EPLM|4.0|More of a question than a review: I am wondering why the CD, which is a hard copy that was packaged and sent to me, costs a dollar less than the MP3. One would think it would be, as it usually is, the opposite way around.
B00328G4V6|5.0|First and foremost, this is an outstanding album. Really energizing and lush recordings that make me, once again, dream of what things would be like if this guy hadn't died. That being said... the goofballs that are on here talking about how they're \\"disappointed about how the album was marketed\\" or \\"the songs seem unfinished!?!?!\\" The guy is DEAD! Give me a break! All these people talking about \\"vinyl is better.. blah, blah.\\" That has absolutely nothing to do with this cd. Everyone has the freedom to buy a turntable and only listen to that version. Or, and I love this one, \\"the mix is bad... blah.\\" If the people leaving these reviews like this were anything special we would know their name. That's great that some of you are nostalgic of your high school days or whatever, but those days are gone. Myself- I'm a Hendrix fan. Which means I am into everything and anything I can get my hands on with him playing guitar on it. I own multiple versions of remixes. I own multiple posthumous releases. It's Hendrix for crying out loud!! Believe me, it's all good. The tracks are great! Alternate versions of Hendrix classics and just great funky, energetic recordings. If this is a bad Hendrix recording then I'll take bad Hendrix recordings any day over the fodder that is released today.
B004LP601S|5.0|I stopped listening to Panic after the disappointment of Pretty. Odd. I see now that was a mistake. This album is amazing!
B00005JK8K|5.0|I have seen this movie many times. I like it and wanted to add it to my collection. Thank you.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I delayed buying this because of all the 1-star reviews, but since I've read every other Jack Reacher book (including Second Son) I figured I'd go for it... and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Indeed, this may be one of the best of all the Jack Reacher tales... because it solves one of the problems I've often wondered about: Why doesn't Jack Reacher just walk away?  After all, he doesn't owe these people anything and he'll likely never be in this place again.<br /><br />Without giving away any spoilers, for much of the book Reacher is in a situation where he simply can't walk away.<br />Throughout most of this book I found myself wondering, \\"What would I do if I were in this situation?\\"  (This is not a question I've asked myself in past books, being I'm not a 6'5\\" guy who regularly beats up people.)<br /><br />If you like the way Jack Reacher analyzes all of the small details, including individually spoken words, you will like this book.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case is the best I  have ever had. It's not bulky like the Otterbox Defender.  LifeProof is the best case.  I had read where some people had trouble hearing but I have not had that problem.
B00932A2MC|3.0|I had avoided this movie in the theaters because, really, how can you add aliens to the board game and make a good movie?  My son saw it in the Amazon Marketplace and he had earned a movie, so I didn't see a problem.<br /><br />As it happens, the movie was fair.  There were some small twists. And I liked the use of the actual veterans. I believe that there was much more in the story as the aliens seem to have a caste system and the castes do not have the same feelings toward the human race.  Stay tuned after the credits for a leader into the next Battleship movie, if it gets made.
B0085KGHOK|5.0|This concert is flat out awesome on blu ray. The video and audio quality are exceptional. For audio, you have a choice between stereo or 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound which is labeled as the original HD master tape from the show. The set list is great also. Even if you are a casual Slipknot fan, you can't go wrong with this blue ray concert. Buy it!
B00005JKGK|5.0|and their daughters.  How our society affects how we live, and how our status affects how we behave.  How we try to compensate our children for the shortcomings we lived with.  Well written and directed.  A must see for every woman, and will<br />be enjoyed by sensitive men as well.  Call it a chick flick if you must, but it goes much, much deeper than that.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This new book moves along at his usual good pace.  The characters were engaging - especially the main man.<br />The protagonist goes through several changes during the book. The crime and aftermath are well written.<br />However, I found that I occasionally was ready to put it down and do something else.  This has never happened with Grisham before.<br />The ending is well done and explains the actions throughout the story.<br />Not a bad read.  Just not great.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|it steals your credits X 2 never noticed until I started buying my Hinton credits. I think they should be investigated by the gaming commission! !! how disappointing

B001QWBM62|5.0|Amazing recorder! The sound quality is just awesome. It's very easy to flip thru the menus. It's pretty much everything a musician needs crammed into a small package. My son uses it to record his jazz gigs and his practice sessions to review later.
B0083JCCX8|5.0|I have to be honest, this wasn't a book that appealed to me when I first heard about it. A book about people having to kill each other until only one survives as a form of entertainment sounded like rather a grim read. I decided to read the book based on several of my friends recommendations and I am so glad I did. It is one of the best books I have read in a while. Constant twists, emotional, love and hate are just some aspects of this book. I am now going to go download book 2!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a well written book with an interesting story line and a unique way of telling the story.<br />Good read!
030758836X|2.0|Having waited months to get the chance to read a library copy of this mystery, I was excited to finally get down to the business of doing so. Right from the start, I thought that the writing was really good due to the story's beyond-just-decent similes and fast-paced plot. My only issue, early on, was the many, unnecessary, crude sex references. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before everything, especially the unraveling, began to really unravel. I felt compelled to continue for the same reason one rubber necks at a wreck, an irresistible urge to see what one might see, while aware how awful it could be. And it was, right through to the ridiculous end. The story contains not a single character a reader might care about, especially the obnoxious, 34-year-old primary suspect in his wife's disappearance, Nick Dunne, and his equally awful wife. Just as easy to dislike are her parents, the overbearing creators of Amy and the trite-sounding Amazing Amy series. Nick's dad only serves to swear and show how poorly the author pays attention to the workings of Alzheimer care facilities, which, in my experience, are always LOCKED and nearly impossible for memory-impaired residents to leave. To top it off, the author employs the creepy ex-beau with overbearing mother angle. The only sympathetic character is small, four-pawed and whiskered. The denouement and ending were truly the dumbest, most ridiculously contrived I've yet read. In summary, skip this stupid story in favor of pretty much anything. Better: The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins, The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Conan Doyle, and The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a fantastic book. It helped bring out the imagination in me. the movie has nothing on this book.
B004N6369Y|1.0|Book had way too much &#34;fluff&#34; to it and not enough substance to it. What a waste of time and money. It is time to retire?!?
B0098VYCCE|1.0|not even remotely close to as good as the book. Kristen Stewart SUX!!! I thought the effects couldve been better. I was seriously bored the whole time!
B008D1LVRY|3.0|It's nothing groundbreaking, but it's alright. Good in-your-face metal. But yeah you could certainly expect more from these guys. Their first album is still their best, and they haven't managed to top it yet.
B008XMXFS6|4.0|Yep, if you liked the Darkness you won't be disappointed after many years of wait for this comeback album. The first song got me a little worried, it's probably my least favorite on the album, but from then on it's pure enjoyment with awesome riffs and signature vocals. Great album, although not as groundbreaking as Permission to Land. I'm hoping this will be the first in a long series of epic rock n roll albums. They have the potential to be a new Queen or Led Zeppelin, let's hope they don't mess it up this time...
B009B50QOU|2.0|I share the same feeling as those who gave this album a mediocre rating. I guess I was just expecting more than \\"power pop\\" songs many of them quite boring. Yes there are a couple of good tunes, but it's very unequal. I swear it sounded like the Beach Boys at times.<br /><br />But my main gripe is the vocals: they sound overproduced and weak. It ruins the rest of the production unfortunately.<br /><br />Like another reviewer said, at least I know I don't need to buy the next two albums, if they're gonna be the same.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show EVER! This show has really set the bar high. Every single episode leaves you wanting more. Incredible, shocking, and suspenseful!

B009VSW15Y|1.0|It does work everytime I try to use the video it shuts down. I would not waste my money the camera takes terrible pictures too.
B009DH371K|5.0|I could not believe how nice the picture was, it was better than the theatre!  I had to drive to a larger city to see this at the theater and apparantly their equipment is lacking because it looks BETTER  on my TV.  Anyone who is afraid of the quality of this blu-ray can buy without worry, the picture is fantastic.  I don't have a theater sound set up so I can't comment on that part of the disc, I was happy with the sound from my TV speaker but I know many people are more particular about their sound setups.  The concert  was the same content as the version they showed at the theater,  it contains the four breakaways with the four band members, which was not as annoying as I thought it would be.  Obviously I would have preferred an edit with the breakaways as an \\"extra\\", but with the original unedited film gone I am grateful we still had this.  The only extra on the disc is the documentary. I am very happy to have this concert on blu-ray.
B0067QPVJ6|1.0|To cut to the chase immediately:  this movie should not have been made. It should have been left alone for another 30 years. At least by the screenwriter and director or whoever thought up this piece of drivel. What an awful, boring, unimaginative movie. The most suspenseful part are the end credits. It was not until I heard the familiar, eerie original 1982 soundtrack that my heart started beating a little faster.  This movie could and should and was supposed to have been so much better. Its brilliant predecessor (John Carpenter's 1982 film of the same name) hit the movie theaters 30 years ago. So the makers  have had aeons to dream up and produce a more worthy sequel (or in this case prequel). They utterly failed. It feels rushed, there's not the slightest build-up of tension and suspense and the characters are made of cardboard. The monster is boring too and without any variation. The film is moronic, full of plot holes and illogical. The team of scientists discover what is the greatest find in human history and they treat it like they just discovered a, well , a rusty bike really. They store it in a shed under a tarpaulin and seem to be much more interested in food and drinks. After drilling holes in it they immediately go about their daily business again. These people are scientists, mind you, not engineers or oilworkers. You really don't care who gets absorbed by the monster and who doesn't. They walk out the door as if they are in a holiday camp somewhere in Norway or Sweden. The milder southern parts of these countries, mind you. The cold doesn't seem to bother them nor does their breath fog up.  The snowcats are deliberately sabotaged to prevent the monster from infesting the populated parts of the world, but when the heroine chases the monster, they are easily fixed again and used as chase vehicle. Making  remakes of classic movies is a very dangerous thing. It is not the 1982 John Carpenter original (which was in itself a remake of a 50s movie of the samename), but this 2011 remake which is in dire need of being remade. Preferably soon. To people who love the John Carpenter original and are curious about this prequel --like I was-- I would like to say: don't bother, it's an utter waste of time and if you do watch it, you will feel so disappointed afterwards. I deliberately avoided reading the reviews in order not to spoil the fun. The film's director, Mr Matthijs Van Heijningen Jr ( a fellow Dutchman if I am not mistaken) might want to consider creeping into the flying saucer buried under the polar ice, hide in a cupboard somewhere and cry his eyes out for this wasted opportunity for at least a decade or so. Because a wasted opportunity this is, if ever there was one.

B007UQRW62|4.0|Let me initially address the high points of this 60th Anniversary Bluray Commemorative re-issue of &#34;Singin In The Rain&#34;: the packaging is beautiful and clearly a great deal of thought and attention has been given to the release. There is a hard transparent sleeve covering the numbered edition box which contains the bluray version of the film, a series of documentaries regarding the making of the film with archival interviews with Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds as well as Stanley Donen, the co-director of the film and director of Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Charade, Funny Face and Two For The Road, and a truly marvelous documentary that was originally part of the PBS &#34;American Masters&#34; series dealing with the life and career of Arthur Freed, the head of production of MGM's musical division during the Golden Age of MGM movies throughout the 40's and 50's, culmination with &#34;Gigi&#34; in 1958. The interviews with Leslie Caron, Andre Previn, Comden and Green and Minnelli are priceless. Now, the negatives: inexpilcably, the film is shown in a picture frame format, rather that in letter box, as shown most frequently on Turner Classic Movies. More significantly, there is no demonstrable improvement in picture quality from the two disc DVD edition released by the Studio for the 50th Anniversary; arguably, that edition is equal to or superior in quality to this set. there is an excellent hard cover book with production notes and good photos, reflective of the desire of the studio to make this a high quality edition. Overall, most favorable. Minnelli's incomparable 'The Band Wagon&#34; deserves similar treatment.
B0088O11NU|5.0|This game is fun, but frustrating for me who is pretty uncoordinated. My kids not only enjoy the game but are pretty good at it. It reminds me of a game I used to have as a kid where you turned the knobs on each side to get the ball to roll. Great purchase, good value, good fun.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|\\"I belong to my beloved, and my beloved is mine.\\"<br /><br />Where do I start?! Words cannot describe how much I absolutely LOVED this book (I created a \\"my favs\\" shelf just for it), but I am sure going to try! Let me begin by saying that I am so happy I did not let the negative reviews stop me from reading this book because I would have thoroughly missed out- Do Not let the comments about it being an \\"abusive relationship\\" keep you from this book either. I think it's ridiculous to mention it and normally I wouldn't even dignify those comments with a reply but I feel compelled to stress just how wrong they are!! It is about an \\"alpha male\\" willing to fight and risk everything for the girl who completes him. It's about devotion and unconditional love in its fullest.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is exactly what it sounds like- a story about a disaster of a boy who meets his match in a beautiful girl and sets out to prove to her and the rest of the world that they belong together.<br /><br />Things I loved (besides Abby & Travis): America & Sheply- they were strong characters that helped bring the book to life! I loved how America was loyal to the core and stood by Abby through all the up's and down's. She was very protective of her and was not afraid to jump in and defend Abby when needed. She is the kind of best friend I'd want to have. Sheply was just as strong a character as her. He was more of the \\"peace keeper\\" within the group, always balancing out the chaos surround them. I like that he was the opposite of Travis. America and Sheply, as a whole, balance out Abby and Travis. They all fit so perfectly together like a close knit family.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster captures you from the first page and holds you all the way through. It's the kind of book where you feel a loss when you read the last page because you are not ready for it to be over. If you are like me, once you finish the last page you will turn back to page one and start it all over again...and just like before, it will be worth every second of your time!

B009OYSFDM|5.0|So far I love this show. I was a big fan of Smallville and it's a great show to watch especially since its about the coming up of a superhero. However, I would not recommend getting it through Amazon and paying 2 bucks an episode. Especially since you can go to cwtv.com and watch all the new episodes a day after they air and if you have an internet add blocker you can watch it commercial free. I definitely recommend watching the show. Just do it the free way.

0817439390|5.0|When I took up digital photography it didn't take me long to realize I needed some additional help with understanding exposures and how to set them. As soon as I chose manual over the auto setting on my camera It was clear I was not getting the results I wanted in low light or night photography. Mr. Peterson's approach to teaching and explaining exposure and how it works with light was clear and easy to understand. What I really enjoyed were the practice exercises he places at the end of a given explanation such as \\"Understanding ISO\\"or \\"Mastering the depth of field\\" and how your ISO and Aperture settings relate to you depth of field in your photograph' these really drove the points home for me. The book is filled with easy to understand and helpful tips to achieve great photographs. I would recommend this book to any one wanting to improve their photography skills.

B008OURHPY|5.0|I just got to see Lianne's first show in the US, and I was floored!  I had heard her name but wasn't familiar with her music.  She was absolutely amazing live.  I ran home to buy the CD and hear the songs I loved her play again. What an amazing new talent.

030758836X|4.0|This book was a real page turner and held my interest with all the twists and turns like a true psychological thriller is supposed to do.  However, the abrupt and lame ending left me disappointed.
B00338QENI|5.0|The book teaches about history and science through the family narrative- biology never went down so smoothly! Also lots of socio-cultural perspective of the African American experience which is living and not the least bit dry or pedantic.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|I believe this is one of the best of the Poirot movies. It has a great location and plot and keeps you guessing until the end. Peter Ustinov does an outstanding job as Poirot. (...and why not? His dad was actually a spy!) I can heartily recommend this movie to any Poirot enthusiast.
B00004RD54|4.0|The Lou Reed album for non-Lou Reed fans (even Lou Reeds HATERS love this one), ROCK'N'ROLL ANIMAL left me non-plused in '74 and kinda still does today.  As a fan, I bought it, of course, and gave it a good listen or two before deciding that it was \\"good of kind\\" (but what was the KIND?) but not my cup of white light/white heat.<br /><br />In theory, I was not against Lou teaming up with guitar heroes Hunter and Wagner and coming out with something like the Velvet Underground Meets Derek and the Dominoes.  There was even something of a thrill to the opener, \\"Sweet Jane,\\" a tune that you can do hundreds of ways and still come up with a definitive rock'n'roll tune.  \\"Heroin,\\" though, was more problematic.  Thundering guitars COULD begin to reproduce the rush of John Cale's viola runs,  but what was with the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" organ in the middle.  Just wrong, wrong, wrong.  I'm sorry.<br /><br />As is typical of the genre,  moments of grandeur slip readily into sheer grandiosity.<br /><br />And \\"White Light/White Heat\\" without the madcap piano?  I dunno.  The album ends pretty well with another great song from LOADED that you can't really muck up too readily--although stretching out to ten minutes doesn't really help much.<br /><br />Fans of the album are quick to point out that it was only half the show (actually, less than THAT, but that's been remedied, you could say, by the inclusion of CD \\"bonus tracks,\\" \\"How Do You Think It Feels?\\" and \\"Caroline Says I\\").  I've always found it personally significant that when more outtakes from this concert were released a year or so later (under the title LOU REED LIVE), I never quite got around to buying it.  I don't even recall HEARING it.  Maybe someday I will yet.<br /><br />In a kind of first, the two bonus tracks are NOT tacked on at the end of the CD, but sandwiched in the middle.  That may reflect something nearer to the original set list and certainly does allow the current product to end on a stronger \\"Rock'n'Roll\\" note.  The concert tour WAS supposed to be in support of the BERLIN album, so their inclusion (along with that of \\"Lady Day\\") makes sense and does fix the album temporally.<br /><br />Listening to it almost 40 years on,  I find I do like it more now than I did then. Still Lou was pretty much drowned out by Hunter, Wagner and Co.  That's what some \\"Classic Rock\\" fans prefer, as it turns out, and believe it or not, I understand that sentiment.  But when I listen to Reed's strained vocals on this record, I realize what he was up against with these flashy musicians.  \\"Classic Lou,\\" as opposed to Classic Rock, was all about leanness, meanness and less being more.  I can be generous and say that ROCK'N'ROLL ANIMAL was a valid experiment. And I'm glad it exposed his work to a new audience--some of whom may have actually found it a revelation.<br /><br />For others, it was probably a pretty good HUNTER AND WAGNER record.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|We got the monitor and wanted to love it, but it seems like it works sporadically. The monitor connects via Bluetooth and from our home wifi network 70% of the time. I attempted to contact Withings and they do not respond in a helpful way. We got the monitor and it drops the wifi connection. I even returned one and got another, but the same. We got this monitor so my wife and I could use it with our IPads, but it doesn't always connect when we are not home and on another wifi network or using cellular. Now I wonder if you can connect to the monitor from outside of your home wifi network?<br /><br />Contacting Withings to get support is non-existent. I am only able to talk with them via their website or email and get non helpful responses. I ask questions via email, they respond hours/days later telling me to reconfigure. Really? The devise is around $300 and it does not always work and no support from the company. You would think the company would take child safety seriously. I still really want it to work, but don't feel comfortable with the monitor cutting out randomly or just not working.

0316228532|1.0|I am at age of 62. Ever since I learned to read, I read (consumed?) a minimum of one book per week as minimum, sometimes as much of three or four per week.<br />As my daughter grow up with the Harry Potter adventures, and as I always compete wit her who will be the first to finish reading every Potter's book (when became available), and as we both have enjoyed them immensely. I naturally jumped at the J.K. Rowling's The Casual Vacancy in a local bookstore when I found it.<br />What happened was an anticlimax: after all the many books I've read in past decades this book has joined a very exclusive club of books which I started to read, but I was not able to read them through.<br />Chronologically those were Bleak House (Dickens), The Name of the Rose (Eco) and - now - The Casual Vacancy. If there were an Oscar for impossibly unreadable books I think Bleak House is still a winner but The Casual Vacancy is indisputably the runner up.<br />Mind you - there were some very bad (lousy) books on my reading menu over the years, but I simply can not say were they better or worse than The Casual Vacancy, because I could not read that boooorrring book through, so I can not compare.<br />My suggestion is: go spend your money elsewhere!

B008MEM24S|5.0|My 5 year old son loves this game! Some levels can be difficult for him, but I just help him out. Sometimes he attempts by trial and error. Sometimes it takes ME a while to figure out the correct way to move to the next level! But I do love how logical the game is. He's learned about the forms of water from it. I think it is well worth the price!
B0065GC0BA|3.0|I found the story a little slow in the beginning chapters so it was hard to get into the read, but once you get past the initial chapters, an amazing story unfolds giving you alot to think about and consider
B009VB9VKY|3.0|The dancing and choreography were great. The plot could have used some more work.<br /><br />A good movie to watch if you want something to play in the background or dont necessarily need to focus exclusively on the TV.<br /><br />The dancing and shirtless guys were fun.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I felt pulled along through the story, breathless and heart racing, like Finnick dragging wounded  Beetee, and awakened on the last page like Kat, in confused wonderment of happened and what would happen next!<br /><br />I only read the first two books recently having resisted all the hype when the books were all the rage and the movie was still in the future. Now its been available at red box kiosks for some time and I'm glad I gave myself permission to take this ride! I highly recommend the books to youth and 'adults' alike.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I am utterly hooked on the work of Gillian Flynn. After finishin Sharp Objects, I immediately bought Dark Places. Skimming the reviews of others, i've noticed that many people shy away from this novel because of it's darker aspects, namely the main character (Libby). For me, however, that's part of what made this book so compulsively readable. It's utterly unique in that it's protagonist is deeply, not just trivially flawed.<br /><br />I also enjoyed what a great surprise the ending was. It's never any fun to have guessed the identity of the murderer halfway through a novel, and the conclusion here was completely out of lft field.<br /><br />SPOILER:::::::::<br /><br />For those of you who have read this, one thing I found jarringly inconcievable was Ben's utter lack of reaction to Diondra strangling his sister. Not only during the murder, but after it.

B0001LJCPC|5.0|Music and some words from KILL BILL II.  Has the best of Morricone's Italian music for westerns with Clint Eastwood.  Mixes all the cultures in that movie in music; Morricone; La Arena and the best horn, country music, great Mexican guitar music and singing, a bit of Cajun and some oriental along with some dialogue.  Enjoy.
B000TGJ80S|1.0|With films like the Godfather Trilogy, Apocalypse Now, and The Outsiders to his credit, it is undeniable that Francis Ford Coppola is a great filmmaker. However, all great filmmakers have their missteps; the third film in the aforementioned trilogy, for instance, and, in my opinion, Dracula.<br /><br />The film is a jumbled mess from the outset, giving the title character an unneeded origin in order to, what I assume at least, make him a sympathetic character. From there, things only get worse. Poor acting and a plot that plays out like it was concocted during an primary school's game of \\"Finish the Story\\" (you know, the one where one person says a line, and the next says another, and so on), the finished work is hardly worthy to be branded with Bram Stoker's name, as it only very loosely resembles its source.<br /><br />The characters of Mina Harker, John Seward, Lucy Westenra, and even Dracula himself are all skewered into shadows of their novel counterparts. The acting of all parts are horrendous, with the legends Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins ham-rolling their way through the script like your greedy cousin does at the dinner line at every buffet-style family get together.<br /><br />As mentioned, the biggest offense is the changes to the story of Stoker's novel. Without spoiling either work, I can only say that what James V. Hart has done to Bram Stoker's original work is a travesty, and that's being nice. If Stoker could have read the screenplay before it was shot, perhaps this unfortunate adaptation would not have seen the light of day.<br /><br />The one star that I did give to this film is for the sets and locations, and the cinematography. It is a beautiful looking film, that falls flat in everything else.<br /><br />If you want an honest adaptation of the novel Dracula, that is at once frightening and moving, track down the original the F.W. Murnau directed, Max Schreck starring original, though unauthorized, 1922 adaptation, Nosferatu.
0920668372|5.0|When my kids were young I used to read this book to them.  I would always cry and my boys would be, mommy it's ok...<br />I ordered 3, one for me and the other 2 for my boys.  I plan on giving them this book now they are adults for Christmas because it has such a great meaning.<br />The books arrived in perfect condition as well as quickly from the time I ordered them.<br />If you want a book that can be cherished for all time I suggest this one.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Best game I play, except for bejeweled. It's played on my Amazon Kindle Fire HD.  Should get it on my computer!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just finished the book and saw the movie before reading it. I couldn't stop cause it was that good. For the first time I think in awhile the movie was definately on key point on everything. So if you seen the movie got to read the book as well.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This was a movie for adults and a return to the character of James Bond that was missing in that awful sequel to \\"Casino Royale\\" (\\"Quantum of Solace\\"). In \\"Skyfall\\" James is scarred (physically and emotionally) and more mature, though a bit world weary, but still able to hold his own in a knock-down, drag-out fight and in the boudoir. Unfortunately, for James and us, the \\"Bond Girls\\" in this movie don't play any major roles and seem, to me, to be on the fringe of things. You don't get to know them as fully as you did the beautiful, intelligent, and sexy Vesper Lynd from \\"Casino Royale\\", and really don't care much about them. I didn't.<br /><br />Anyway, Daniel Craig's Bond is older but still has rugged goodlooks, boyish charm, and a muscular physique...unlike the previous prettyboys and fops who played JB after Sean Connery left. He fits the picture one has of Bond, even though Craig isn't the way Ian Fleming described JB in his novels. But, hey, neither did the un-manly Roger Moore and look how many ridiculous Bond movies he starred in.<br /><br />I will say that the psychopathic bad guy, Raoul Silva, was quite JB's match in this one. He is, perhaps, the most cunning and evil of all the loonies James has ever faced.<br /><br />There was more humor in this movie than in the others, I think, and those who have seen many of the previous Bond flicks will enjoy the references to little things remembered from the other movies.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Skyfall\\" and give it 4 and 1/2 stars.

B004VB3V0K|4.0|A thorough tutorial that introduces Haskell programming without getting wrapped up in technical details and high-level abstractions.  An off-beat sense of humor that keeps the reader awake without wandering away from the purpose of each chapter.  The organization of subjects is logical.  If you find yourself momentarily confused then you can be confident that everything you need to know to understand the current topic has already been covered, so it's easy to go back and review it.  The author keeps the difficulty of each step under control, so I didn't need to make any leaps of faith and have to dazedly read another chapter or two in order to understand a new concept.  A wonderful contrast to the freely available but insidiously difficult \\"A Gentle Introduction to Haskell 98\\" tutorial.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is cool! i love playing this at arcades but now i can play it on the go!! This is a must get app!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this book, can't wait to read the last one in the series.  I cannot put it down once I start reading.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I'm afraid that the series, like Reacher himself,has reached the \\"sell-by\\" date. I've been a Reacher fan from the beginning but I think the quality of the stories has been going down and I suspect that this is the last of the series that I'll buy.<br /><br />My problem with with this offering in particular is that the plot moves so slowly that it is difficult to sustain any interest in it. Child is just \\"showing up\\" as he writes one a year of these. Sustaining a long series is hard for anyone, and I now think it's time for him to move along with something new since he is such a talented writer.<br /><br />Hopefully I'll be proven wrong and the next one will be dynamite.
1451695187|1.0|First I want to state the \\" Heaven \\" described in the book is more of a new-age or spiritual place and definitely NOT a Biblical place.<br />I do believe him when he says he had an \\" experience \\" but the description of where he was and what he saw sounds more like hell with demonic beings.<br />From page 31 he describes grotesque and threatening faces roaring, groaning and screeching out of what he describes as \\" muck \\" in a cold, wet and dark subterranean world he says he was trapped in. Here he saw troll-like under-ground laborers performing endless and brutally monotonous tasks as well as reptilian and worm-like creatures crowding past and occasionally rubbing against him with their smooth or spiky skins.<br /><br />Later he ultimately he had a good experience but with a single girl on a butterfly. That makes me think he honestly was in a bad place and whatever was in there had the power to show him a pretty girl briefly to convince him he was not. Would satan want to make a place he is trying to lure you into look horrifying if he didn't have to? No way, and if you were in his realm there would be a complete absence of God, Jesus as well as all things Holy such as Heavenly Saints and Angels, which this place the doctor went to is completely empty of. The Bible warns us of deception and to test the spirits.<br />As the Bible states:<br /><br />2 Corinthians 11:14<br />NIV 1984<br />\\" And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light \\"<br /><br />1 John 4:1<br />NIV 1984<br />\\" Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world \\"<br /><br />The butterfly girl said to him:<br /><br />Page 71<br />You are loved and cherished<br />You have nothing to fear<br />There is nothing you can do wrong<br /><br />That sounds very cultish to me.<br /><br />Then we have this:<br /><br />On page 133 and 134 a man has died from cardiac arrest, is out of his bodyfor 9 minutes, has an NDE and sees Jesus. The doctor calls his NDE nonsense from the standpoint that cardiac arrest does not represent close-to-death condition.  I would like to get an opinion from a cardiologist on that actually, or did he call it nonsense simply due to the fact of a Biblical reference? Just a guess is all since the Doctor never saw anything Biblical in his NDE whatsoever. He refers to God but more as a creator and several times simply as \\" OM \\", which is a mystical chant in several religions but not in Christianity.<br /><br />On page 135 he deducts his NDE as \\" a technically near-impeccable near-death experience , perhaps one of the most convincing such cases in modern history \\". This conclusion he comes to is as he states from the fact that it is impossible to argue what happened to him from a medical standpoint was all fantasy.<br /><br />What makes him think his NDE is more convincing than other NDE experiencers? It's like finding Bigfoot. Until there's a body every picture is just a picture.<br /><br />This book is not convincing at all since he talked about the NDE experience very little compared to everything else such as his life, past, hospital stay, illness and career. The book is actually much less convincing than any other book I have read on the subject. I had high hopes for this book but it is one serious letdown.<br />This man seems to think he knows more about the brain than God Himself and even more so now, when ultimately how it works is a mystery to all except God.<br /><br />This was a very boring book and a complete waste of money. I also did not understand the arrogant and combative stare on his face on the back cover either, but I do hope he ultimately becomes closer to God the father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit and brings other closer as well.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read as many reviews of this book as I could before purchasing this.  I don't agree with the negative ones at all.  I fully admit I know little to nothing about the Military, which at times the acronyms got kind of hard to figure out.  However, what I took away was the thoughtful way a truly historical event was portrayed.  In combination with several articles on the Bowden book, regarding the strategy around \\"Geronimo,\\" this lent to an all encompassing view of the entire Initiative.  I recommend reading it, if nothing else but to understand just a tiny bit about what a 'soldier' experiences while making History.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I feel like I've been reading this book forever. Child has always had a tendency to overwrite but this is ridiculous. If I have to read one more description of a dingy motel I'll scream. Other Reacher books are much better so you can skip this one. As a matter of fact, I'm taking a break from this series.
B0036UMM84|2.0|Streisand STINKS in this film. Most of her acting is jarring. The summation of all of the very bad scenes is shocking to the point of being disturbing. Her performance is nothing short of being schizophrenic. AND SHE EXPECTED AN OSCAR.<br /> She was pushing 40 and playing some kind of ingenue. Her attempts at acting young are like bamboo under the fingernails. She eats like a dog a couple of times,\\"you put your back and everything into it\\", supposedly to show that she is some kind of hungry mongrel upstart. There is only one or two good scenes in this load of crap: Barbra yells at the paparazzi, \\"When's it ever enough!\\" Then the scene is ruined by the next scene. A still angry Barbra asks Kris, \\"Don't you know how good you are?\\" with her affected new-born star voice. Streisand is best when she is bitchy and bitter. This should have been about an older unkown.\\" She comes across as very vain and narcissistic.<br />  She tried so hard and badly not to play herself, sad. She literally runs to her desert-house hide-away wearing what looks like a soiled baby diaper! Who is responsible for this ass and crap fetishism. Her hairdresser boyfriend made a fool of her for several years by telling her she has a \\"nice ass.\\" She doesn't.<br />The only good things about this film are the very gorgeous Francesco Scavullo poster and the lovely Oscar winning song from the film. I read that it took 10 million to make the film and another 10 million to sell it. Puzzlingly it did well at the box office. Perhaps everybody was too stunned to put how bad it is into words. A close friend tried to warn me: \\"She played a sh*t part!\\"
B004EC5IV6|5.0|If you liked Evangelion, you REALLY need to see this! 1.11 and 2.22 are just plain amazing, especially this volume (2.22). I expected some touched up art and a slightly different viewing order from the original series, but I was pleasantly surprised. Almost every scene in this DVD is brand new. There are even new characters and different storylines. Watch it! You'll love it!
B00A65FYG4|5.0|When I first heard of Walking Dead I wasn't sure I would like it. In fact I knew I wouldn't. However, after catching up with all 3 seasons I can say that this is now a desert island series for me. It's like Lost but with Night of The Living Dead put together. The money they spend to film and create these zombi's is incredible, they spare no expense. It takes balls to do what these creators and producers do. Killing off major characters could put your show in a tailspin. I will never stop watching and will highly recommend to others. There has never been a better Zombi or post-apocalyptic anything and the storyline is awesome. Love the action and suspense!
B0091THRCU|5.0|I've always went with the OtterBox commuter series cases for my previous two iPhones (4 & 4S), but the iPhone in any case loses one of its greatest appeals: that it's thin and light.  I want to be able to experience the phone as it was meant to be used, without a case.  However, I know that I need some sort of protection for the phone.  I took a chance and went with this case (but the more accurate term is a pouch, I feel that a \\"case\\" is not meant to be removed regularly from a device) and I am extremely satisfied.  I'm a realist and will always be honest, and this case is great.  I know in some of the other reviews, there have been complaints that it's too snug, but it's not.  Plus, it's thin and form fitting.  My phone in this \\"case\\" is awesome; I love the way it feels in my pocket, so much better than a typical case.  I would recommend this case to anyone.
B0002XMF5S|3.0|And I noticed that the review said that Ray Gillen was the listed singer on Eternal Idol and this one called Seventh Star but Glenn Hughes is listed in this review on this page as the singer so who is the real singer on this release? It seems that someone has gotten themselves mixed up with the reviews? The other review says that Eternal Idol's vocals were re-recorded over by Tony Iommi after Ray Gillen left the band two weeks before the release of the album in 1987.

B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan is an amazing tenor.  The sound is better than Pavarotti.  These songs are sung in Italian, so even pop tunes sound operatic.

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|PRECISION: this is the review of DVD issued in 2007, which contains the full (uncut) 126 minutes long version of this film. WARNING: This review includes some minor SPOILERS!<br /><br />\\"Mclintock\\" is one of the very few pure comedies John Wayne appeared in. Although officially a western, this film is in fact an absolutely not serious retelling of the \\"Taming of the shrew\\", with some slapstick elements.<br /><br />George Washington \\"G.W.\\" McLintock (John Wayne) is an extremely healthy and somehow aged cattle baron, who owns most of the land, water rights and businesses in and around the good city of Mclintock, named after him of course. McLintock began his life without a penny to his name and he is very much a self made man, something he is very proud about. Last years however, ever since his wife Katherine (Maureen O'Hara) left him, were kind of hard on him and he started to drink even heavier than usual. He is also in conflict with some local civil servants, beginning with the governor of the territory. And then, all of a sudden, his estranged wife arrives to the town, willing to obtain divorce and sole custody of their daughter Becky (Stephanie Powers) - which would be bad enough already, even without Ms McLintock finding out her husband just recently hired an attractive lady (Yvonne De Carlo), officially as a cook. Even worse, \\"G.W.\\" favors one of his hired hands, Devlin (played by Patrick Wayne, \\"Duke\\"s son) as his future son-in-law and Becky seems also to be sweet on him - something that is anathema for Katherine, who dreams of her daughter marrying one of distinguished gentlemen from the East Coast...<br /><br />What follows is a pure comedy, with jokes not always flying very high, but it is still a very entertaining, very relaxing and quite heart warming show. Made in 1963 this is a rather old film, but I do not think it aged so much (as \\"Taming of the shrew\\", which is much older, didn't age either...).<br /><br />Some scenes including Indians are a little bit naive, but on another hand in this western the \\"Injuns\\" are also shown as quite noble and tragic characters. At one moment a Commanche chief about to be arrested says to the governor: \\"We will not just die away, we will go, but not without a fight. It will not be a big fight because there is not many of us left and we have only few guns, but there will be a fight before the Comanches are gone\\". This is a surprisingly good speech to be found in a slapstick comedy...<br /><br />A great delight of this film is in its total lack of political correctness. There is a Chinese guy working on McLintock's ranch and every word he says is a pure delight, but of course today nobody would dare make any Chinese speak like that... Many John Wayne's lines seem to come straight from an Ayn Rand book, so if your political opinions are a little bit left from center, watching this film can cause you some hypertension. There also seem to be only three things required from a man to be \\"real\\" man - work hard, never ask for any handouts and never, NEVER refuse a challenge to a fistfight...<br /><br />For the feminists, well, watching this film can be life threatening, as each of the main female characters is ultimately \\"tamed\\" with a hearty spanking...)))<br /><br />As far as the technical aspects of this 2007 DVD (the one with red stripes on top and bottom of cover) are concerned, be advised that not only this is the COMPLETE and UNCUT version, but also the film and the soundtrack were restored and cleaned, so the quality of image and sound is EXCELLENT!<br /><br />Bottom line, I liked this film very, VERY much, I spend a lovely evening watching it. This is a guaranteed remedy against bad mood after a hard day at the office. Enjoy!it naive, but on another hand in this western the \\"Injuns\\" are also shown as quite noble and tragic characters.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books have a great story about love and the what you will do for it.  I had heard all of the rumors about this series of books but the story and the love that they shared for each other made me finish the series in just a few short days.  I think that if you are looking for a good love story these are for you.  In fact this book was my favorite in the series

1591843162|3.0|The book carries an important message; be someone that is remarkable, be a linchpin. They bring the \\"emotional labor\\" to their work. These people are scarce; hence indispensable. Godin too advises us give to others with no expectation, that gesture and act of unconditional generosity changes everything, creating abundance in our lives (again not a new message, same message been highlighted by different gurus the like of Eckhart Tolle, Tony Robbin)
B00012QM8G|4.0|Schindler's List is based on a true story depicting the events of the Holocaust, and a man who tried to save as many Jews he could. The Holocaust took place during World War ll where millions of Jewish men, women, and children were killed by the Nazis. Oskar Schindler was a rich and successful factory owner. Although Schindler wore a swastika pin coining him as a Nazi, he had several Good Samaritan moments throughout the movie. During the war, Jewish families were being pushed out of their homes and lost all of their belongings. Many were killed, and many were taken to conservation camps for hard manual labor. There they suffered starvation, nakedness, and in many cases death. Schindler and his wife watched from a distance as hundreds of Jews were being shot in the streets. This was the eye opener for him, and he decided to go to the general to negotiate. The general laughed at Schindler for feeling sorry for the Jews and doing little things for them such as giving them water when the general had them crammed in a hot train. Schindler eventually convinced the general to give the Jews up to him so they can work in his factory. Schindler created a list of a thousand Jews that would come with him. He knew they would be safe at his factory, and made sure there would be no guards supervising their work. The Jews were grateful for Schindler, but he still felt extreme sorrow for those he did not save. In the movie he broke down and cried saying he could have saved one or two more if he sold his car, or if he sold his gold pin. The movie ends with the real Jewish survivors of the Holocaust paying their respects to Oskar Schindler by placing rocks one by one on his gravestone.

030758836X|5.0|What a twist this read was.  Going along back and forth between the two characters through the first half of the book then whammies couldn't put it down. Enjoyed this book tremendously.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Charming and wise, this book was a delicious pleasure to read.  The characters are well drawn and the plot well paced.  I will definitely look for more books by this author.
1439127700|4.0|Very interesting compilation of the comings and goings on of past Presidents.  Kind of like being a fly on the wall. What kindnesses and treachery takes place between the incoming and outgoing Presidents. A great piece of history revealed.
B006LSZECO|3.0|2.5 stars. This book must have looked fantastic as an outline- It has plenty of gotcha moments.  But from page to page, I thought it was boring. I found myself skimming just to find out what happened in the end. Every character just seemed dead behind the eyes. The only people in this book with what appear to be normal or dare-I-say-happy lives are those that had to let people think they're scum.  And I hated the ending- it's disgusting.  This gets 3 stars because the concept was interesting, but overall it comes off as a big whine about the world sucking.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Somehow I missed this flick when it was in theaters, but I'm glad I took a chance on it when it went on DVD. This was another one of those high school teenage drama comedies--it kind of reminded me of Mean Girls, actually. The acting was great, as was the casting. Many of the major actors come from some of my favorite TV shows. The story was not easy to predict either, which put me at the edge of my seat, trying to figure out what would happen next.<br /><br />I see that some people gave this movie just 1 or 2 stars because they felt it was not representative of today's high school kids. While I'm sure there are many other positive reviews here to counter-argue that, you have to realize that every school is different. And there are plenty of schools where rumors spread quickly, and reputations are ruined, with whispers in the hall and clicks on smartphones. Sure, some of the situations seem extreme, and you're not likely to find a girl like Olive who is going out of her way to be known as the school slut. But it's a movie, and anyone old enough to watch this should know better that some of these movie scenes almost never happen in real life. It's a movie, after all; the producers have got to make it feistier and show something we don't see every day.<br /><br />This movie was my first exposure to Emma Stone, and it did not disappoint. I've enjoyed many of her other movies subsequently, including [[ASIN:B003Y5H574 Crazy, Stupid, Love (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] and [[ASIN:B004A8ZWVK The Help]].

1469984202|2.0|Ok folks, I don't know how many of you readers are also gamers but this whole book is like the Fallout series from Bethesda Software. Mine and all time best is the \\"Fallout 3 and all it's DLC's. In the game, we have our hero escape the Vault (Silo) after fighting/defeating the evil (bad) Vault Director. The outside world is not totally destroyed, it has life, some human other mutated from the radiation and there are many Vaults (Silo's)! Our hero goes out to into the world to explore and (maybe) save it (be the hero). I had Months of fun playing this game, get the game, you will have a lot more fun and its the same story!<br /><br />This book is not an original idea, I heard that the movie rights were sold, I see a lawsuit in the making!<br /><br />The writing was ok and hopefully this author will put that skill to an original idea in the future.<br />The plot and characterless are pathetic, everything happens as the author needs it to happen, not very believable (my legs ache just from thinking about it).<br /><br />I understand that many ideas are not \\"original\\" but retold stories in different ways, this story is just too far to the game concepts in my view!<br /><br />How people could give this story a five star is just beyond me, perhaps they were just rescued from one of the Silo's and this is all they were given to read!<br /><br />If you truly want a fantastic story told by a master, try Raven's Shadow by Anthony Ryan, another self publisher (get it while it's still cheap, he has been picked up by a publisher!)
0385535147|2.0|I bought this book with high hopes.  The New York Times review stated that it was a suspenseful page-turner.  I was disappointed to realize 1/3 of the way through the book that there was no way that anything was going to go wrong with the narrator's plan.  I kept waiting for any obstacles to appear in his way...but no.  We have a scene where the FBI is admiringly discussing how the narrator is tricking him.  Then he moves gold bars around with no problems.  He sneaks through security with fake passports SEVERAL times....really?<br /><br />And the characters are all the same.  Except for the FBI guy who hates bad coffee, not one of these characters has any personality.  This is what I call an \\"all plot, no character\\" book, except it has a ludicrously unbelievable plot as well.<br /><br />On the good side, I DID read the whole thing.  I will just forget it immediately.
B00979CS50|5.0|For the past 45 years or so, Neil Young has been one of the very best recording artists in the rock genre; from Buffalo Springfield in the 60's to his work with Crosby, Stills & Nash, Crazy Horse & his solo projects since then. Why? There have been so many rock artists that sound great, but unfortunately ruin their music with poor lyrics...not so with Neil. Pick an album by Neil, any album, and not only are you going to hear great sounding music, but you're going to hear intelligent lyrics that are full of compassion, love, & a do the right thing message. I like his gentle acoustic albums a great deal, but when he decides to pick up his electric guitar you know he's going to bring down the house, especially when he's working with Crazy Horse.<br /><br />This new album is excellent; loud crunching guitar, a hard-driving rhythm section and of course Neil Young's great vocals and clean, decent lyrics on the whole. Easily worth 5 stars in my opinion & heartily recommended to old & new fans alike.<br /><br />Enjoy & God bless :-)<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />The one track that gave me pause lyrically is \\"Twisted Road\\":<br /><br />  \\"Walking with the devil on a twisted road<br />  Listen to the dead on the radio<br />  That old time music used to soothe my soul<br />  If I ever get home I'm gonna let the good times roll<br />  Let the good times roll\\"<br /><br />But after reading these lyrics I came to the conclusion that 1. These are not necessarily autobiographical. 2. Walking with said creature indeed would put anyone on a \\"crooked road\\"  and while walking this way, the person walking is obviously having BAD times and yearning for \\"Home\\" which would leave said creature behind and the walkin' man finally enjoying \\"GOOD\\" times.<br /><br />Well, that's my take on it...a song about being lost and in bad company and hoping to get free of evil so one could finally get back \\"home\\" and be truly happy.<br /><br />Great sounding album & I've now made peace with the one song whoselyrics at first bothered me but no longer given the meaning that I think Neil intended as I have written about above.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Is it just me? Or has Angry Birds become as bug riddled and quirky as Star Wars itself? This thing freezes as many times as the plot of the famed worst of the last movies. Started off as promising as the first (1977) film but grew more annoying than the cartoon characters of the last flicks. I'm not a Lucas-basher, just thought it a perfect analogy that this version of the game family is so much like the car wreck that is the last of a great film family. I've tried ABSW on three Android devices (Xoom, Droid X &amp; Galaxy 3) and had it lockup routinely on all three. Some of the lockups have even required reboots to clear. Like SW 1-3, wait until they are remade (later releases) or it comes to cable before giving any money to LucasArts or the AB franchise.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was one of the best purchases I've made on the Kindle.  The story was great and I'm looking forward to the next book in the Series.  I would definitely put this book and author at the top of my list.  Some of my favourite fantasy authors are Patrick Rothfuss, Brent Weeks, Brandon Sanderson and Jim Butcher.  If you enjoy books by any of those authors I'm sure you would enjoy this book.
0316227706|5.0|There are no words for how absolutely precious and ingenious this book is.  It exceeds pure joy and even if you are a \\"cat\\" person, you will surely become a dog fan after turning the pages of this book.  It will be many a Christmas present this year for friends and family.  I hope Mr. Casteel is currently shooting a follow-up to this book!  I will be first in line for it :-)
1423140605|5.0|The book was very good. The writer seems to have fallen below his usual standards in the previous two \\"Lost hero\\" books in this series, but in The Mark Of Athena, he has come back to the humorous style of writing as the books of the Percy Jackson series. I enjoyed every bit of it, except for the 'cliff hanger' ending. There is no additional reason to make us hang on until the next book, we will wait and watch for it eagerly regardless.

B007REV4T8|5.0|The year 2012 marks the 50th Anniversary of [[ASIN:B0020PW1V4 Dr. No]], the movie that kicked off the James Bond film franchise. It was a relatively low-key spy thriller compared to what was to come. Since then, the series has had its ups and downs, but most fans would agree, by the time the 40th Anniversary rolled around with [[ASIN:B0020Q099Y Die Another Day]], the gadgets, stunts, special effects, and even plots had become too over the top for their own good.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0020M99LC Casino Royale]] ditched the clichés and started from scratch, introducing Daniel Craig as a young James Bond just licensed to kill. The movie took a fresh, character-based approach to the series. This approach was continued in the (in my opinion) underrated [[ASIN:B001VIMCW4 Quantum Of Solace]], which saw Bond developing more class and becoming less emotionally attached to his work. \\"Skyfall\\" is the best of Daniel Craig's Bond movies so far. Just like Sean Connery and Roger Moore (arguably) hit their strides with their third Bond movies ([[ASIN:B0020MDEHW Goldfinger]] and [[ASIN:B009G85ALG The Spy Who Loved Me]], respectively), Daniel Craig has now made it past the two-movie learning curve and really settled into the role.<br /><br />While six years ago Daniel Craig was playing a young and brash 007, in \\"Skyfall\\", those around Bond are starting to suggest it may be time to retire. While the mature Bond still has the rough-around-the-edges qualities that distinguish Craig's take on the role, and while he's still able to show angst in the movie's dramatic moments, he also has that wry half-smile while taking out enemies, that satisfied smirk while seducing beautiful women, and he's finally comfortable enough to toss out a few one-liners. Though his delivery is so wonderfully dry that you almost don't realize they're puns.<br /><br />The movie starts with one of the best opening sequences in decades, an action-packed chase scene involving guns, Range Rovers, motorcycles, and speeding trains through Turkey. This climaxes in Bond's supposed death when his backup sniper accidentally hits him, knocking him off the tracks into the water. After the main titles (one of the most bizarre credit sequences in Bond history, but also, with the help of [[ASIN:B009Q6ADG0 Skyfall]], one of the moodiest and most effective) it turns out Bond is taking advantage of being presumed dead to try and get out of the spy game. Until he learns someone is targeting the organization he worked for.<br /><br />Javier Bardem's villain, a flamboyant bleach blonde, is probably the most memorable since the classic days of Auric Goldfinger and the man with his golden gun. He's introduced with one of the best evil monologues ever, and every scene he's in after that is totally chilling. Berenice Lem Marlohe and Naomie Harris are this movie's Bond girls, and while Marlohe's Severine is one of the most stunning Bond girls in ages and Harris' Eve is one of Bond's savviest sidekicks, their roles are both inconsequential compared to the true female lead. That would be Judi Dench as M. While the relationship between Bond and his superior has been explored more in Daniel Craig's Bond movies than ever before, here it's pushed front and center, forming the movie's emotional core, driving most of the plot, and making M a major player rather than just a character to provide exposition, showcasing Dench's talents as an actress.<br /><br />Sam Mendes manages to keep a personal, dramatic atmosphere through the entire movie, but still work in jaw-dropping action sequences. Unlike \\"Quantum of Solace\\", they're thankfully filmed in a steadier, more traditional manner. The movie's also very well paced: this is one of the longest movies in the series, but it feels like one of the shortest. And Mendes and the rest of the \\"Skyfall\\" crew manage to avoid the clichés while still including Bond's trademarks. There's a new Q, in the form of the young Ben Whishaw. In a fresh new take on the character, whenBond seems disappointed by how practical the gadgets are, the young tech whiz responds, \\"Expecting exploding pens? We don't really go in for that sort of thing anymore.\\" The gadgets bring to mind the earliest Bond movies, where it came as a surprise when Bond was able to use his equipment, unlike later movies, in which the situations that called for the gadgets were so specific you could make a checklist of them in Q's scene and then check them off as Bond used them. There are one or two other familiar characters that pop up as well, in ways that manage to feel both classic and fresh. And Ralph Fiennes brings charisma and gravitas to his role as M's new handler.<br /><br />This is definitely a Bond movie for modern times.  It's the first time a character (Judi Dench's M) drops the \\"F-bomb\\" and the first time the bad guy actually makes a pass at 007.<br /><br />Like the 40th Anniversary, \\"Skyfall\\" is filled with references to what's come before. Unlike \\"Die Another Day\\", where the plot line seemed like a flimsy excuse to hang inside jokes on, in \\"Skyfall\\" the references are much more sly and subtle, and the story's actually sharp enough to support them, so long-time fans can smile while there's still plenty for newcomers to enjoy, even as the throwbacks go over their heads.<br /><br />There are a few missteps. After all, what Bond movie's been perfect since the Connery days? After some awesome action scenes, the climax seems to be taking a page from a totally different play book, and some of the characters' motivations and actions don't hold up to scrutiny. But overall, the mix of drama, action, and humor make \\"Skyfall\\" one of the best Bond movies out of the 23. It skillfully ushers in what's sure to be another new beginning for the series, and, back in fine form, I'm excited that \\"James Bond will return.\\"
B007EDYN36|3.0|When I first heard of a Peter Criss bio way back in the late 80's I was quite excited to read Peters story.  Some 20 odd years later when the thing finally came out, I bought my Kindle copy the first day.  What I got was Peter Criss' rant at anyone and everyone he ever came into contact with in his life.  For how much Ace Frehley didn't complain or go into details about things that left him scarred in his bio, Peter MORE than makes up for it in his.  So much so in fact, that to me, the story begins to lose credibility by the end.  Peter comes off more as a paranoind schyz, which is really too bad.  He mentioned that he had actual writers ghost writing for him on that 80's version but he didn't like the drafts because, \\" it didn't sound like me\\". That's why people use ghost writers, Pete. So you come off as less of a dick.  Damn, now i've done him over too!  Sorry, Pete.
6301792734|5.0|This VHS set was truly brand new, still with the plastic wrapping and special offer sticker from 1995, each individual cassette still shrink wrapped. With all the DVD sets available it was confusing as to which was the actual theatrical release before Lucas began 'fixing' them with enhanced sound and all, so I went with this VHS set. Also MUCH cheaper than all the dvd sets since I only wanted these three. The set is of the final retail offering of the original theatrical version of the 'first' three Star Wars. Thank you for offering this set, I truly am very grateful you had it!

B00684J49U|4.0|When i saw the first episode of Grey's Anatomy season 8, I knew it would be just like the very first season: unbeareable to stop watching. I was captured imidiately by the mindblowing univers of Grey's and their actors, and now having watched all the season, i'm waiting, craving and longing for the next season.<br />However, I questioned myself after i finnished watching the last episode, weather or not, it was time for the company to pull the plug? Don't get me wrong, I love this show, but I just don't see the point in continuing a story with the actors and their lives (because to me they'll always belong at Seattle-Grace-Mercy-West) when they have finished their resedency and are ready to leve Seattle Grace- Mercy West behind and move on?<br />In my head the perfect ending would be for the serie to end her with Mark and Lexie together instead of being killed, but anyhow I am now waiting with my breath held for season 9 !<br /><br />Awesome series !
0307387178|4.0|\\"Into the Wild\\" is a very interesting book about the life of a young man who decided to get rid of his normal, mundane life, move to the wilds of Alaska and live in nature.  It follows his story, using interviews awith key friends and acquaintances, of how he travelled around the United States in search of his real truth.  In the end, he ends up dying in a remote area in the Alaskan wilderness, all alone and malnourished.<br /><br />Did he die of starvation?  Was he sick from berries he ate?  What was his mindset during his last days?<br /><br />The book, and the movie [[ASIN:B000ZN802W Into the Wild]], hauntingly tell his story.  It's a story that every parent wishes their idealistic 20-something children don't try to live themselves.  It's captivating and interesting, however.<br /><br />Krakauer is a great writer, who creates even more drama and suspense here than it may warrant.  I also highly recommend his [[ASIN:0613663616 Into Thin Air (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)]], one of my favorite books of all time.

B0083K3A5G|3.0|Chris Pavone's debut novel is fresh and exciting. With a premise similar to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's \\"Mr and Mrs Smith\\"-but much cooler-this story introduces Kate, the perfect 21st century CIA agent. Oh wait, she's not, not really. She quit, to become a wife and mother. But then her husband was a crook so she had to get back on track. And her new friend is FBI (though we're not supposed to know that). No, wait, when you reach the end, she's actually not your typical FBI agent either. With twists and turns of espionage experiences... combined with changing diapers and tennis lessons, this book is a refreshing newcomer to the spy story genre. And the main character is a regular person, sort of.  It's not a comedy, nor a satire. But it's not too serious either. I hope they make a movie out of it (though please, don't put Jolie in as Kate!).<br /><br />Obviously, since Pavone is a former resident of Luxembourg, the setting of this european excursion is believable, right down to the cafe descriptions. His style of jumping from future to present, however, took a bit of getting used to and actually took about three jumps before I understood the pattern. Although not a fast read-due to the jumping and extended descriptive scenes, I think-it is the kind of book you think about between reads. And you're never really sure where the next twist will take you. Well thought out and well executed. I look forward to Chris' second novel.
B001HMSFFC|3.0|I think fans of the show will really enjoy this movie, but I had never seen an episode!! I found it a good laugh and I was entertained. It's definitely not my favorite movie and I found some parts cheesy, but I decide on a final three stars (probably because I've never seen the series).

B004ULEEY8|5.0|I thought this was a pretty entertaining movie. I'm glad they have this in 2:40:1 aspect ratio so you can see the whole film. Lots of action to keep the pace moving along nicely. The Blu-Ray on this is pretty good as far as I'm concerned. I've seen this in dvd & the Blu-ray is so much better. I can't comment to much on the audio as I listen through external speakers hooked up to my stereo. No fancy sound system. Sounded real good in stereo though. I got this for under $15.00. Not bad, but I had to wait a while for this price. Plenty of special features also. Overall I think I got my money's worth on this film.

B001BANK32|3.0|First published in 1977, The Shining was only Stephen King's third book and first hardcover bestseller.  It was also his second book to feature a writer as the lead character. I was first introduced to King in the mid-90s and spent many a summer reading his books back to back. The flame was relit last year when I decided to start collecting his books in hardcover again and picking through the ones I'd missed out on over the last decade.<br /><br />I have to admit that The Shining is not one of my favorites.  I only chose to read it now because a sequel featuring a grown Danny is due out next fall called Doctor Sleep. As soon as I heard about it, I knew I wanted to read it but knew I needed to read The Shining first.  Now, I'm not so sure.  Of course, Doctor Sleep is sure to sell thousands upon thousands of copies and become an instant NYT bestseller.  Too bad Stanley Kubrick isn't around anymore (Kubrick directed the movie version of The Shining).<br /><br />Though I've never seen the movie of The Shining all the way through, I don't have to dwell too much into the book's plot to let you know what it's about.  You've either seen the movie, or know enough about it thanks to its place in pop culture to know what it is about. Though I do know Kubrick purposely changed quite a bit for the screen, chances are he made it better.<br /><br />In the book, King offers very little history on why the Overlook hotel is haunted, or why it has such an ominous effect over its off-season caretaker.  It's just a bad place. And though the haunted hotel is indeed the lead character driving the story, the book really isn't about the hotel at all.  It's about Jack Torrance and his son Danny.  Jack is a failing teacher, recovering alcoholic, and wanna-be writer - all traits one could use to describe King in the 70s. He was writing what he knew, no doubt.  Danny is a boy who suffers from \\"the shining,\\" the unique ability to see things that aren't there - sort of like a medium, but sort of different.<br /><br />All we really know about the hotel is that a lady killed herself in Room 217, some gangsters killed a couple of people there, and something might have gone wrong at a masked ball held there a long time ago.  Oh, and the previous caretaker killed his wife and daughters and then offed himself there, but they are not ghosts here.  That's it.  Add to this some animal shaped topiaries that move around on the lawn and will attack you, which was a pretty creepy detail, but that's it.<br /><br />There are some intense moments where the elevator is operating on its own or Jack hallucinates having drinks at the bar, but still no real history into the hotel despite Jack even trying to find out on his own when he comes across some documents in the basement. Ultimately, all of this somehow drives Jack insane (along with the reader), which scares his wife Wendy, and upsets little Danny. Spell murder backwards (REDRUM!) over and over and over again, and you've got yourself a book.<br /><br />Now, I will give King credit where it is due.  After all, this was only his third book at the time. King excels at writing good characterization.  He still does today. Right from the start, you are in Jack's head and that's where you stay as his mind spirals out of control.  And ultimately, Jack's character is what drives this book. Not Wendy. Not Danny. It's all about Jack.  And how ironic that an over-the-top actor named Jack in real life would play Jack in the movie!<br /><br />The story itself reminded me of some of the weaker Koontz books I've read.  Yep, Koontz.  We have a genius idea that would make one hell of a story, but only ends up letting down our expectations because the writer just didn't take us where he could have. At 600 pages, this was also King's largest book at that time.  We know from the lofty tomes he's written since then that he let us down by about 200 pages at least!<br /><br />So, while it is a classic and remains a part of pop culture historythanks to certain cinematic elements, I'm glad I can now say I've read it.  I will read the sequel as well next year.  But... it's not one of my King favorites when it comes to horror.thanks to certain cinematic elements, I'm glad I can now say I've read it.

B004HW7JH4|5.0|-----------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"Mad Men: Season Five\\"<br />(HBO, 2012)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br />As with previous seasons, \\"Mad Men\\" Season Five takes place between the defining events of history, capturing glimpses of America in transition, but not in the grips of any great spasmodic lurch. The season is set between Spring of 1966 and '67, as the Vietnam War was simmering to a boil, but the huge, historic anti-draft and anti-war demonstrations were still on the horizon, while the Civil Rights movement was in transition, having won huge Congressional victories in '64 and '65. Drug use was filtering its way into the mainstream (as seen hilariously in the episode \\"Far Away Places\\"...) but the so-called Summer of Love hadn't happened yet. In short, New York was still swinging, and the show's focus remains on its characters more than on the trappings of the times they live in. In many ways this is one of the quietest seasons to date -- a lot happens, but it's more in the lives-of-quiet-desperation mode than the amped-up, somewhat exaggerated retro vibe of Seasons 1-4. Great stuff with Joanie and Don's new wife, Megan, as well as some choice bits with Roger, while Pete continues to devolve before our very eyes, and an oddly serene Don Draper becomes more inscrutable than ever. True tragedy and some major changes come at the season's end, and -- oh, boy! -- are we ready to see where Season Six takes us. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
1616960922|3.0|This could have been a great story but just feels too long even as a novella. It's a very simple spin and it feels unreasonably stretched to accommodate an appropriate length for the price. Personally, I'd rather have less to feel more from it. Better than the last outing but I'm beginning to wonder if Brandon is falling into a rut with these short form stories. Looking forward to AMOL next year.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|I was one of the hundreds of thousands who turned out to give. The Avengers one of the biggest opening weekends of all time. Avengers is amazing, it was really, really well done. I love these people who are like, I don't know. You know, it was a little unrealistic. They're comic book heroes! People ask if there was a message,  if there was one it was that \\"America can kick ass. I love Iron Man - since they emphasized not only was he a superhero but a capitalist, philanthropist, and a renegade. I walked out feeling pumped because Iron Man showed that Americans are the ones that are different thinkers. We do have guys that are rich and are renegades.  Another area I personally feel was a positive American message,  Captain America is a man out of time, feeling the loss of American exceptionalism.  He's lost the sense of patriotism that made him Cap because the country seemed to have lost it.  He's standing on top of a cab shouting orders to the New York cop, who says \\"why should I take orders from you?'  Cap proceeds to trash a dozen aliens and the cop falls in line.  He took away the man's apathy and cynism and made him proud to follow the flag in that moment.  It was the most positive nod to America I've seen in a movie in a very long time.  It is a movie full of funny moments for instance when Loki spouted off about him being a God and not be manhandled and Hulk grabbed him and smashed him back and forth like a rag doll the whole audience errupted with laughter, when the Black Widow seemed in peril but was actually just goating her captures, when Captain was giving out orders gets to Hulk and says and Hulk pause Smash! The brought a lot of laughs as well. Whether you like comics like action movies or just looking at how well a movie is written this movie will fit the bill. Extremely well written with plenty of hidden inadvertent images and messages as well as good for almost all ages.

His characters became personal friends and I am so glad to run into them again in the second book.  I have just started this one, and Nazis are not my favorite characters, but I know that I am in for a satisfying read.

B003BW0CB6|3.0|I have loved the other books by Connelly that I have read (Lincoln Lawyer, Fifth Witness, Brass Verdict & one other Harry Bosch series). The Reversal was great until about 2/3 through. It was about the time the trial started, then the story lost steam. It was like the characters were worn out. Haller gives a so-so performance as a prosecuting attorney in the courtroom. Bosch tracks Jessup up to a park in the middle of the night and then again to a beach hideout, then nothing happens with that angle. We are left at the end to wonder if Jessup killed other girls. Haller doesn't even care if he ever finds out either. At the beginning, readers get a glimpse that something permanent may be happening with Mickey and Maggie, then that fades out of the story. The most aggravating part is that what should have been the major action of the story (Jessup finally blowing and killing his attorneys) happens in a phone conversation that Bosch gets. Readers are not even witness to this!<br />The saving grace for this book is that like any Connelly book, you get an education in what the legal system is really like with the rules of discovery, preliminary hearings, jury selection, reasonable doubt, DNA testing, etc. So I'm not completely disappointed. He just needs to slow down with cranking out the books. If the wonderful characters that he has created are getting old and tired, then create some new ones. Bosch's daughter wants to be a detective. Let her have a series.

B008AU7F3C|5.0|Well, first off I won't claim to be some self-proclaimed expert on music.  I am just a listener and can only attest to what I like.  And this album easily falls into the awesome category with me.  Had heard one song prior to the release of the album and was not that impressed.  But then I got the whole album and listened to it a few times.  What can I say, just as pleasing to me as her other 2 works.  I think she is a genuine and unique talent and hope she continues to put out quality music for us simpletons to enjoy.<br /><br />And for the reviewer dogging on those of us giving it 5 stars.  I did it with great thought and appreciation for what I feel is a quality album well worth every star.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|With so many thorough and spot-on reviews here, I will just toss out the following:<br /><br />- I grew up on the TV series, and though glossy and modern, this is a fitting tribute.<br />- Depp is his usual, scenery-chewing, glorious self -- a character actor of the highest order.<br />- Getting past the fact that Tim Burton cannot make a movie these days without his own wife (Helena Bonham Carter), Johnny Depp, and one or both of them wearing a red wig, this is much more in the groove of his older, classic films.<br />- Having worked off-Broadway with the original Angelique, Lara Parker, I spent the whole movie looking for her cameo; I never spotted her. Apparently, less cameo, more ballyhooed background work.<br />- This is DARK. If you were led by the trailer to expect a comedy, you are not going to find it here. BUT, it is darkly comic and there is a general mood of frivolity and levity; it is not a heavy drama.<br />- This is not for the kids. Though there's nothing showing that should be covered by a bathing suit, there is one particular sexual situation that is beyond saucy and rough, and there's plenty of blood -- though being a hater of the gore genre, it wasn't so heavy as to make me uncomfortable. It's more staged than realistic.<br />- Overall, a well spent couple of bucks and couple of hours.
1455527475|1.0|This book is awful. I didn't think the author was so self centered to think that anyone wanted to hear his life story. He sounded very averse to the competitive nature of the US that made the US the US. He's unbelievably boring and lakes any color in his writing. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a Goldman Sachs attempt at revamping their reputation. There is very little here that is even unethical really. As you can see all of the reviews are pro this book, I'd have to imagine they had a hand in this as well. I feel like I wasted my money and there was very little in this book that could be worth even pennies of what I spent.

B006YXTRHY|2.0|The reviewers are right; the Twilight Saga series are poor movies.  It's hard to see how even teenagers could enjoy them, and impossible to see how anyone else could.  Alright, the werewolves are cute, but I'm perfectly happy to watch \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\", or Airbuddies, when I want to see cute talking dogs.<br /><br />All four of the series so far drag.  There's little plot, and little action.  Long periods of time are spent in adolescent mooning, and in smooching.  Half of the little tension there is, which isn't much, is concerned parents acting mildly concerned.  Two brief fights and two brief episodes with speeding vehicles occur per movie.  The Jacob vs the Vampire thing is way overplayed. The young male werewolves in human form are corny.  It takes the couple four movies to manage to get married, and at the end of the fourth the baby is barely born - at the cost of the life of the mother, who is brought back as a vampire at the very end of the movie, for those who spent four movies wondering if and when that would happen.<br /><br />Some vampire chiefs in Italy who are mean for no apparent reason, not even because they are vampires, mush in and out of the action pointlessly killing people for no reason at all, not even vampire reasons.  For instance, a young girl was made a vampire to build a big army of vampires to kill the seven member vampire family.  She alternately hides from the fighting and participates reluctantly in the action.  The vampire family try to rescue her.  The vampire chiefs kill her in order to prove that they don't give any second chances.  Neither killing the girl nor the reason given to do so make any sense.  Her death doesn't contribute in any way to the subsequent plot, nor to the general mood, except to the general air of insanity and depression. It doesn't even figure in subsequent thought or discussions about marriage.  Of course, I did begin doing housework because I knew that whatever was going on when I left would be exactly what was still happening when I came back in five or ten minutes - and I wasn't disappointed even once.<br /><br />An entire village in Italy that allegedly drove out the vampires, actually permit the chief vampires to live in a castle in their midst and visit them to become vampire food.

1451638450|4.0|This is NOT a Vorkosigan book.  It is a Vorpatril book.  Vorkosigans are mentally nimble and thrive on conflict and chaos.  The one Vorpatril who has appeared in nearly every Vorkosigan book has a different set of priorities and, as result, the book is different from a typical Vorkosigan book.<br /><br />But that's not to say that it isn't any good!<br /><br />Watching Ivan deal with all of his friends and relatives is always fun and he's got quite a surprising reason for chatting with them.  And then there are the people from Jackson's Whole, who have equally good reasons to chat with his relatives and friends...  Oh, and then there's By Vorrutyer as well!  Lois has sometimes said that her plots are based on finding the traumatic thing she can do to her characters and then working from there.  She's certainly found Ivan's weaknesses!<br /><br />The startling thing about this novel is that the hero is not a do-or-die kind of guy, he's just a decent person stuck in a difficult position and doing his best (which sometimes isn't very good) to keep everybody from getting hurt.  This is a direct departure from the usual Vorkosigan novel.  Another departure is that the reader has to do a lot of the work in connecting the dots because Ivan is busy trying to avoid doing so for the reader.  CJ Cherryh does the same sort of thing and I've always found it to be very interesting (and it makes you want to go back and re-read the story to better understand the parts you missed earlier) but it isn't for every reader.<br /><br />There's not much new world-building going on here but there is an intense examination of Barryar from a much different viewpoint than the Vorkosigans and the reader gets a much better understanding of certain things that should have been self-evident from the beginning of the series.  I do not know whether Lois knew these things all along or made them up for this novel but it is impressive.<br /><br />Another startling thing about the book is that the reader has no real understanding of how the book is going to end until the last few pages.  There's no big bad guy in this novel but there are a lot of interested parties tryin to push the story in a particular direction and the book hangs in the air until the very end.  But the ending is VERY appropriate and satisfying.<br /><br />The book will probably be more appealing to female readers than male readers because most of Ivan's problems come from his inadequate responses to certain questions certain women drop on him.  I, as a male reader, would have enjoyed the book more if there had been 50 pages less of this sort of humor, but it was not without its merits.<br /><br />My final note is that the humor in the novel is better developed and sustained than in any other book in the series (including Civil Campaign).<br /><br />My only remaining question: What will Lois choose to do next?  She's long since earned the right to do whatever she wants.r has no real understanding of how the book is going to end until the last few pages.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|I was able to read this book right after the first installment of the Century Trilogy \\"Fall of the Giants\\". Reading the two books back to back made the characters and events fresh in my mind. Although Winter of the World was a \\"good read\\", I gave it only three stars for a few reasons. I found it disappointing that an epic book about World War II such as this book, there was only a casual mention of the Holocaust and the extermination camps found by liberating American and Soviet troops. I found some of the meeting of the characters at different parts of the world far fetched and I also found some of the sexual details completely unnecessary. I was able to finish the book in a week during vacation and in spite of some of the shortcomings, enjoyed it and learned from it.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is the best example I've seen of what I call \\"iconic directing\\" (which is Anderson's unmistakable style) in which there are a lot of still camera shots of subjects, beautifully framed (often with symmetrical surroundings) and often still or hardly moving. Sometimes the camera moves only laterally while it surveys a scene. The subjects in these scenes are like icons of an idea or of humans or personality types. It is as if Anderson is trying to deliver a cinematic art museum complete with Mona Lisa shots: the still shots of lovely Suzy (Kara Hayward) staring into the camera, and even a museum guide, narrator Bob Balaban.<br /><br />This is in stark contrast with  \\"I want you in the room with them\\" style of directing done with hand held camera action - the best example IMO being the very remarkable film `Biutiful\\". In such films it's not icons but real people in your face.<br /><br />The story is a kind of fairy tale, of course, but amusingly and charmingly presented with the great music of Benjamin Britten adding to the artful atmosphere. But it is the directing with its beautifully framed images, even more than the cute adolescent love story, that is well worth the ticket price.

B009JZPH32|3.0|...but I haven't seen it yet. I'd like to know what makes this movie so much better than the rest of the new releases, that is can't be rented, only a digital copy sold at 18 bucks? Seriously, I don't understand why some movies you can rent, and some you have to buy. The digital format is already there, so why can't they all be rentals? I also can't relate to those buy movies never having seen them before. I would think that you'd have to know for sure if it's worth owning, which would requiring see it first. That is my own personal policy at least. If I haven't already seen it in the theater, I rent it before buying it. I need to know it's something worthy of watching multiple times before committing to a purchase. Please give people the option of renting or buying when the films are released to the home viewing market.

0307352145|4.0|Had I not seen Susan Cain speak I would never have considered this book, much less actually purchased and read it.  But I'm pleased I did, and have subsequently recommended it to family and colleagues.<br /><br />I found reading this book to be an experience akin to sitting in the ophthalmologist's chair, peering through the big device at the chart on the wall, while the lens combinations click into place.  \\"Better or worse?\\"  When the lens of this book was clicked into place suddenly some of the characters in the chart that had been fuzzy became clear.  It's readable and informative.<br /><br />I've long practiced \\"after action reviews\\" of events and activities, and have extended that practice to a hybrid which focused on interactions.  Understanding why someone might act/react in unexpected or seemingly unpredictable ways offers the opportunity to adapt an approach to minimize counterproductive conflict and maximize collaborative potential.  And then through an empathetic recognition of the influences, pressures and motivations which shape people's reactions, I've maintained that collaboration can be forged between seemingly fundamentally incompatible individuals.  Susan Cain's work offers another tool in the collaboration tool chest.<br /><br />The high-reactive in me had an additional reaction unrelated to the basic message.  No doubt sensitized to the theme as I read the book amidst the maelstrom of US election week I was struck by the author's exclusive use of liberal icons of American politics (Eleanor Roosevelt, Al Gore, Barack Obama) as examples of public figures.  The book left me unsure, therefore, whether the author associates some set of attributes, consciously or unconsciously, with a political ideology.  Hopefully not, because that would shortchange the value of the message which is fundamental and transcends ideological affiliations.

0399157565|2.0|WARNING-includes spoilers.<br />I was incredibly disappointed with this novel, just like the last 3 or 4 novels of Cornwell's about Scarpetta, and this will most likely be my last one of Cornwell's.  why, you might ask.  Well, Ms. Cornwell's novels have become simply puy, narcissistic.  Cornwell has turned her last few Scarpetta novels into that mundane, formulaic, routine sequence that arrests a number of popular authors as they begin to much toward creating massive amounts of novels in a very short period of time.  These more recent novels have you glued to the book for hundreds of pages, only to have each and every last one of them end, rather brusquely, with an attempted murder of either Kay, Benton, Lucy or Marino.  Each murderer/serial killer/rapist ultimately focuses on one of the four, and it is next to impossible to ever guess who it could be.  It is always a random, peripheral person that makes no sense.  And it makes me mad, when I have come to the end of the novel. And for what?  For it to end suddenly, always be about Scarpetta, and someone ALWAYS wants to kill her in the end.  I actually know 2 medical examiners, and their lives have never been in danger the way Cornwell places Kay's life in danger.  Her last few KS books have been, quite honestly, completely and totally unbelievable.  Shoddy planning, dark, unbelievable, narcissistic, and disappointing.  And to think this is the same author who penned the magnificent PostMortem.  Pathetic.

B005LAIISA|5.0|I have really enjoyed the Ice Age movies in the past and all have been funny, but this one was simply hilarious  There were so many funny lines and situations within the movie. I found myself rolling on the floor many times in the movie. While my kids did not always get the humor that I picked up on, it was still a great story for the whole family! If you are looking for a movie that will keep you laughing from beginning to end with a great cast of characters (both new and old) this is definitely the movie that you should be turning to! All-in-all I was so impressed, and you will be too!

B004EPYZTE|4.0|I want to start this review off by talking about the 3D version of this film. If you are looking for pop outs, this is not your movie. There is maybe two scenes of SLIGHT pop outs. The depth on the other hand want to bad. Nothing like Avatar, but out was pretty decent, but nothing that really makes you go WOW!<br /><br />  Now onto the 2D version. The color is really great looking, even the dark scenes. The landscapes are very vast and beautiful, and really just suck you into the film. The audio really kicks ass also with 7.1 dts. You hear every sword hit, scream, and every piece of flesh rip.<br /><br />  Jason Momoa does a fantastic job as Conan. His size and build make you believe he is a Barbarian. His acting was spot on, he looks like a wild animal on the prowl for his next meal. I also have to give a shout out to the young boy who played the younger Conan. He is just brutal, and will definitely leave a lasting impression on you.<br /><br />  I think alot of people give this movie a bad rap, because they compare it to the original, and even though this is a remake, they didn't base it on the first Conan movie, it was actually based on the Dark Horse Comics. If you have ever read these comics you know they are alot darker and brutal than the Conan movie with Arnold, and in this sense this movie totally succeeds.<br /><br />  If your into brutal fights, blood magic, and an occasional view of breasts, give it a chance and  check it out, even if you just rent it.
0061743526|5.0|This novel is a timeless classic. Many people, including myself, are required to read this book in high school. I normally HATED all of the books that were required. I went in with this attitude when first reading the book, but I actually found it interesting. It introduces racism from that time period, through the eyes of a child. Because it was a little easier to read than most required books, I really enjoyed it. I even read this book a second time in the same year, which I never do, especially with required books. I came from a conservative home and this book brought to light some of the issues that even occur today with racism, just not as harsh. I believe the harshness of the book opens many people's eyes to what occurred during that time period. If I ever have the time to, I would read this book again and again.
B0085RQLXK|1.0|See, now - this is just sad.  Sad, sad, sad.  Why oh why don't the members of this band who are not Steven Tyler just find a Steven Tyler replacement, and get back to Aerosmith circa 1977?  Holy freakin' hell - the ballads!  Half a dozen of 'em, and that's about 5ive too many.  Gone - and by 'gone' I mean 'LONG gone' - are the days when they had a ballad per album, and they were good tunes: \\"Mia\\", \\"You See Me Crying\\", et al.  Now it's just all rehashed \\"Don't Wanna Miss A Thing\\" crapfest-clones, and it all ends up sounding like a Steven Tyler solo album more than anything.  So, so, so disappointed in this album, and entirely not worth the 11-year wait.  I'd like to say that the harder edged tunes of this album balance it all out in the end, but - sadly - not so much.  If this is the best they can offer then it is long past time that they hang it up, call it day, pack it in, and cue the fat lady.

0544103750|5.0|I just reread this exquisite novel for the third time in anticipation of the theatrical release, and I still consider it my favorite book.  It's been six years since I last savored Pi's incredible journey and I was smitten all over again.  The beautiful language captured Pi's experience so elegantly - the joy, the anguish, and the intensity were tangible.  Pi is one of the most extraordinary characters I've ever encountered in literature.  I celebrated his victories, I mourned when he wept, I felt his fear, his hunger and thirst and his will to live.  Of course one cannot write a review without mentioning his bond with Richard Parker.  Pi acknowledges the very fact that Richard Parker, who could have been his death, saved his life.  I could rant and rave for paragraphs about the aspects of this book that I adored, but I don't want to waste words when I can just bask in the afterglow of an amazing story.

B007THA4FI|5.0|And here we thought we'd never get to this point. The review of The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />I've posted a few things en route on this book, because reading it was like a journey and on a journey, you make pit stops from time to time. Really, all books are a journey, but this one in particular expanded my horizons. Much like that cross-country drive you take to save money by not flying; there's that mid-drive lull when you wonder 'why on earth did we drive?' until that moment of spectacular view and you tell yourself, 'that's why...'<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy has a spectacular view.<br /><br />As most people know, The Casual Vacancy is written by super-selling Harry Potter author, JK Rowling. She's the author with the million-dollar idea of a bespectacled magical boy. Literally, a multi-million dollar idea.<br /><br />With such a platform already built, branching out into a new genre, adult fiction, was a leap someone with her status was able to take without fear of failure. I'd like to believe as an author, she does worry if her work will be accepted or rejected by the masses, but that worry does not include her financial status.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a triumph for Rowling. Keep writing. Please.<br /><br />The Novel:<br />The premise of the novel centers around the death of Barry Fairbrother, who dies unexpectedly in his early forties. Being all of this takes place in the very small town of Pagford, the little idyllic English abode is in shock (apparently, small towns are the same everywhere). Barry was every man's man, and every woman's secret crush. He had a way of ingratiating himself upon people be it with fine talk, a cajoling laugh, or a kindred spirit. He was noted as the living embodiment of a self-made man that harbored no arrogance about it. And his death reveals all the vengeance that has been swept under the rug for years in Pagford because his death leaves an open seat on the council, and political battles reveal the deep demons festering in the hearts of every citizen existing among the cobbled streets and ancient abbey. This empty seat soon becomes the catapult of a full-blown town war. Awaiting with baited breath who will fill this seat takes the reader into the minds of Pagford's citizens from the rich to the poor, the educated and uneducated, and the self-proclaimed high to the very, very low. The book is thought-provoking with regular twists and turns. A solid read.<br /><br />The Review:<br />For me, the book started strong. I felt an immediate connection to the characters and even though Barry Fairbrother's death occurs early in the novel, I felt sadness for his departure. This is a testament to the brilliant writing style of Rowling. Too often, authors kill a character early on without establishing a real connection with the reader, and consequently it leaves the reader feeling like they lost only a stranger. Fairbrother's death establishes a thread that winds throughout the novel.<br /><br />The town of Pagford is well depicted. I can still see it in my mind's eye. It's quaint and charming, but at the same time, cold and gray. Rowling does an excellent job developing the backdrop for the story to include how this backdrop intertwines with the plot.<br /><br />Her characters are so visceral. She explores the lives of not only the adults in the town, but also the teens and the very real affect they take on the lives of their parents, their teachers, the headmaster, and the counselors. She exposes the viscous cycle of the educated and the uneducated, and blows the roof off the hypocritical alliance the rich people of Pagford have for the poor they \\"are trying to help.\\"  Her portrayal of the high school students I found to be expertly written as it captured the way I often view the students I teach everyday; and sadly this was not a good thing. I think, as a teacher, it gave me some comfort to know that across the ocean, teenagers are the same. I was beginning to think we only had true pricks in America.<br /><br />It is certainly true this book is not for children. There is the foulest of language and horrible, depraved depictions of sex. The context of the book really requires you to examine marriage, friendships, and acquaintances in a new way. It causes one to think about trust and how very fragile this is, and it plays to the fantasy life both men and women desire to have amidst the reality they are living in. This book is not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a literary read. It is not fast paced nor action packed, but it is deep. I found there was a lull mid-way for me, but as I pressed on I understood the intentionality of this choice by the author. Real life is not always in fast-forward, and this book is a snapshot of real people, of real life.<br /><br />In the end, I would give this book 5 out of 5 stars, a rating I rarely establish upon any book. I know I will continue to think about the lessons and depth of emotion created by Rowling in this novel for years to come. That, my friends, is the mark of a good book.ks in America.<br /><br />It is certainly true this book is not for children. There is the foulest of language and horrible, depraved depictions of sex.

B0095VP8D4|5.0|I paired this with a [[ASIN:B009HP42HQ MSI AMD A75 MicroATX DDR3 2133 370 Motherboards FM2-A75MA-E35]] and [[ASIN:B007NOY07K AMD Memory Entertainment Edition 16GB (2X8GB) 1600MHz Kit DDR3 (PC3 12800) AE316G1601U2K]] and it runs Windows 8 Pro x64 fast and smooth.  This setup is used as a gaming-rig and I can run most games on pretty high graphics settings nice and smooth without lag or slowdown.  Things load fast and the OS starts up quick.  I was surprised how fast this APU really is both in CPU and GPU performance.  The drivers AMD puts out for it are also fast and rock solid.  This is a world-class product and I have been truly impressed and pleasantly delighted by how much bang you get for your buck.  I would buy this again if I was in need of another product of this type.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone.

B009GYSQV6|3.0|I've been following Crystal Castles since their first single \\"Alice Practice\\" back in 2006. I instantly fell in love with their first record because of my interests in electronic and chiptune music in general. They were a huge breath of fresh air in the scene with the way they combined many electronic music styles in a way no-one had ever tried (or at least executed as well).<br /><br />Fast forward to 2010 and they release their sophomore album which only builds on this unique use of electronic music while adding even more complex layers and melody on top of it. Crystal Castles (II) was probably one of the best records of the last decade.<br /><br />So here we are in 2012 with a new record which has left me in a bit of an identity crisis. On this record Crystal Castles have changed their style dramatically. Gone are the Atari generation inspired chiptune effects and luscious complex layers. This record takes a hard turn in a gothic synth-pop direction.<br /><br />The song structure overall is much simpler--to a fault. The music is so simple and repetitive that I found myself skipping songs frequently; searching for a song which would keep my attention for the full three to four minutes. This is a problem I never had on the other records. There's just not enough variation in melody in these tracks to grab me. Some of them just drone on and on to the point where I am genuinely bored.<br /><br />The lyrical content on this record is very dark. Most of the lyrics confront depression and nihilism. I just couldn't get into this because generally I turn to music to lift me up. When I say lift me up I don't mean I want to hear only happy thoughts, but I need some kind of point or conclusion to the song help me process the emotions. This record just doesn't accomplish that and feels like a drawn out therapy session with no conclusion. I can enjoy a record that has something profound to say, but depressing lyrics just for the sake of being sad does nothing for me.<br /><br />One interesting thing I can say about this record is that it does a much better job representing a Crystal Castles live show. There has always been a huge discrepancy between how the records sound and how they sound when performing. This is because during a live show Alice would sing all the parts without many effects. On this record everything was recorded and delivered pretty straightforward and sound as if they recorded them in one-take and never processed them with any effects.<br /><br />I have to wonder if they wrote and recorded the record with this as a goal of recreating their live sound  in mind. Or perhaps touring non-stop subliminally influenced this. Alice's voice is center stage on all the songs. There are no guests or interesting voice effects, but that's something I really miss. Again, to my point of the record lacking the diversity that the other records had.<br /><br />The track \\"Violent Youth\\" is the one saving grace on this album because it harkens back to the sound on the first two records. It has a killer dance-electro beat, complex layering, and takes several unexpected turns throughout. Hopefully this means they aren't done with the old sound, and that this record is just a temporary change and they are not redefining their sound for good.<br /><br />I'm giving this three stars. While it is well produced, and the sound is lush, the songs are repetitive, and it is far too simple. I really miss the Atari/Chiptune effects, and complexity of their older work. If this was my first Crystal Castles record I might not be so critical. However, these guys set the bar really high.<br /><br />This record seems to fall into the trend I've seen with indie and electronic music this year of migrating toward minimalism (example: this year's Sigur Ros and XX albums). While those bands executed this change extremely well, with Crystal Castles it simply contrasts what made Crystal Castles such a great act on the first place. I just can't get on board with it.>One interesting thing I can say about this record is that it does a much better job representing a Crystal Castles live show.

B0090X4GJE|4.0|British pop star Ellie Goulding follows-up 2011's [[ASIN:B004KWVE1I Lights]] with [[ASIN:B0090X4GJE Halcyon]], led by single \\"Anything Could Happen.\\" Single \\"Lights\\" remained popular as Goulding was preparing to release Halycon, peaking at no. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.  All-in-all, Halycon is a creative and enjoyable pop album that showcases the lofty amount of both talent and potential Goulding has.<br /><br />\\"Don't Say A Word\\" opens mysteriously laden with vocal reverberation effects and synthetic pads before eventually breaking into full-fruition dance pop. \\"If you never, if you never, if you'd never said anything\\" Goulding sings on the chorus. The bridge is certainly unexpected, but works well nonetheless where Goulding sings \\"And if it saves us, and I fall down/I will leave your words behind now/if you never, held me under...\\"<br /><br />\\"My Blood\\" sports sound vocal production and strong vocal treatment during the well penned chorus (\\"And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now/and God knows it's the only way to heal now...\\").  The supporting vocals are well executed as well, yielding some lovely harmonies. \\"My Blood\\" is a standout, but is overshadowed by the inescapable \\"Anything Could Happen.\\"<br /><br />\\"Anything Could Happen\\" is by all means Ellie's `ace-in-the-hole.' \\"Anything\\" features a stomping four-on-the-floor styled beat and recurrent use of rhythmic piano.  Goulding's tone is raspy but endearing. The chorus is simple, but incredibly catchy (\\"Yes since we found out/since we found out/that anything could happen, anything could happen...\\") Additionally, the vocal treatment of the lyric \\"anything could happen\\" is notable.  All in all, \\"Anything Could Happen\\" is pop gold.<br /><br />\\"Only You\\" features a clapping-dance beat possesses some clear hip-hop sensibility. \\"Only You\\" possesses limited lyrics, but a small amount of words ultimately doesn't limit Goulding's imagination.  \\"Only you, only you can see the emptiness I feel...\\" Goulding sings, \\"when you're with me, when everything you say, I'm on my knees...\\" Well produced, \\"Only You\\" keeps the momentum lofty.<br /><br />\\"Halcyon\\" is effective, if a slightly less satisfying than the best cuts.  \\"When it's just us, you show me what it feels like to be lonely\\" an energized Goulding proclaims on the chorus.  Production is initially restrained, but evolves as the cut progresses.  Even at its most restrained, the production always `drives' forward.<br /><br />\\"Figure 8\\" marks a change in production from Ellie Goulding and Jim Eliot to MONSTA.  The chorus in particular is gargantuan, with Goulding's vocals well mixed to rise above a wall of sound. \\"I chase your love around a figure 8/I need you more than I can take...\\" she sings, selling \\"Figure 8\\" capably and keeping the excitability of Halcyon in play.<br /><br />\\"Joy\\" ends up being a stronger track than \\"Figure 8,\\" characterized by its palette of sounds which includes string patch, eventual addition of `hip-hop' drums, and additional vocals.  Most notable is Goulding's upper register, which delivers some of her purist moments.  Songwriting is not too shabby itself, particularly on the chorus.<br /><br />\\"Hanging On\\" opens with tension and proves to yield rhythm sans percussion. Vocal effects are rampant here and once more Goulding graces us with her upper register.  \\"Hanging On\\" is none too shabby, though less stellar than the brilliant \\"Joy.\\" \\"Explosions\\" is solid as well, sporting an operatic vocal sample.  The production is once more unique, with drum programming entering on the second verse to give more structure. \\"Explosions on the day I gave my heart away,\\" she sings \\"It's my turn to run into the flames/and I'll never be the same.\\"<br /><br />\\"I Know You Care\\" has a nice concept ultimately, but `sits' in the same place; some drums or varied production would have shaped it better. \\"Atlantis\\" finds Goulding's vocals hardly decipherable, though it is her approach to the particular performance. But the simple chorus \\"Where did you go\\" passes with flying colors if nothing else does.  \\"Dead in the Water\\" closes most editions of the album, and does so exceptionally. Goulding's raspy vocals are as distinct as ever as she makes her final statement to her audience. Some versions feature bonus tracks \\"I Need Your Love\\" (Calvin Harris featuring Goulding) and \\"Lights\\" (Single Version).<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B0090X4GJE Halcyon]] is a fine album. It has its flaws - mostly towards the end - but ultimately, there is little to complain or trivialize. Hopefully, Goulding will gain more traction in the United States though only time will tell.  But face it, \\"Anything Could Happen\\" is one sweet, addictive pop song if nothing else.

Some versions feature bonus tracks \\"I Need Your Love\\" (Calvin Harris featuring Goulding) and \\"Lights\\" (Single Version).<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B0090X4GJE Halcyon]] is a fine album. It has its flaws - mostly towards the end - but ultimately, there is little to complain or trivialize. Hopefully, Goulding will gain more traction in the United States though only time will tell.  But face it, \\"Anything Could Happen\\" is one sweet, addictive pop song if nothing else. Enthusiastically recommended.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Rowling proves that she can do what J.R.R.Tolkien could not: write about the 'real' world, the one inhabited by you and me and not by an imagination-boosting array of elves, dwarves, orcs and other creatures. Tolkien was dejected by his inability in this regard, and Rowling has every right to feel elated by her newly discovered ability, for she acquits herself superbly in _The Casual Vacancy_. In fact it's hard to believe that the writer of the Harry Potter books and the writer of _The Casual Vacancy_ are the same person, since _The Casual Vacancy_ is so far and away superior to the noxious fantasy/reality mix of Harry Potter (so distasteful to the Tolkien devotee).<br /><br />Rowling is completely in control of the world she portrays in _The Casual Vacancy_, writing with equal ease about the genteel and the horrendously squalid. She does well writing about sex without it absorbing all of the narrative interest. Her metaphoricity is striking and always apt and shows how completely free her imagination is of fantasy.<br /><br />Rowling is to be congratulated for making the transition from children's fantasy writer to serious novelist and is to be celebrated as a writer of accomplishment.

1451638450|3.0|I would suggest picking this one up at the library.  It's worth the read, but is (in my opinion) ultimately disappointing.<br />Ivan has spent most of his years sliding thru and around any of life's obstacles, spectating for the most part.  I think LMB allowed him to slide into his marriage and then avoided most conflict pretty easily...yet again.  Not fair for those of us waiting to see his cosmic comeuppance.<br />I'm a total Bujold fan...I've bought everything...every single book ever.<br />I believe this may be the last Vorkosigan book, and I wouldn't have missed it for anything.  But being disappointed with Cryoburn and now this one will make me stop future re-readings of the series with Diplomatic Immunity.

0307744434|5.0|First off - I loved this book! It was a gift, and I probably would not have bought it for myself but I couldn't put it down! The masterful weaving of details and storylines kept me coming back. I read this book quickly, and want to read it again, because although I tried to pay careful attention to detail, I know I missed important elements that would add to the story's depth. I frequently read suspense thrillers, and although this wasn't a thriller, it was certianly a suspenseful story that kept my interest beginning to end. Well done!

It was not well written, and the plot became more and more with each book sadly laughable. The ending as it were, last words, what writer ends a book with \\"That's all for now\\"? I suppose the NY best seller list means she was lucky ,very ,very lucky.

Unfortunately there are some slow points as well and some bad choice in the plot. The first two books were definitely better, but it's worthy completing the trilogy.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Bought this Gaming and Rendering and its great, but after 1 day using it the problem started to show up. Basicly this Processor (38**) have a BIOS problem with Intel Extreme Series DX79**, it shuts down after 5 seconds on start-up and you have to try a lot of times until it really start-up. The solution that Intel provides isnt good, they sugest to get a Intel i7 from the 39** series and update the BIOS to the latest version so it should solve the problem but its kinda hard to find someone to lend you a processor from that cost xD After trying a lot of times to update my BIOS with the i7 3820 it worked! (dont ask me how cause the BIOS problem wont let you restart the system LOL!). After the problem is solved you can use it normaly and I 100% recommend this Processor, just be carefull with the BIOS version that is on the Motherboard :)

0670026182|4.0|The moment Katie Quinn Davies work was shared with me by a fellow food photographer friend- It changed my life. I know cheesy but as a student of commercial photography shooting food I was longing more something rustic, pared down, homestyle and with a dark and moody lighting. Katie's continued to inspire me day in and day out and the introduction of her book has given me the extra leap of courage I needed to continue on in this challenging industry. Of course I pre-ordered her book the moment I could (with a copy for that food photographer friend) and the moment I arrived I began cooking each and every recipe as fast as I could. She. makes. beautiful. food. I love in the US and have a relatively new oven (last year) so I would mention that through some burning I now cook at half the temperature Katie suggests in her book.<br /><br />I.love.It.<br /><br />Shannon

B007REV4T8|3.0|SKYFALL is too many movies to ever succeed in being one great movie - or one very good movie.  The opening chase that never ends is just a tiresome echo of the opening chase in CASINO ROYALE that introduced us to the new Bond.  It worked then, but is ridiculous now.  Bond should burn the tux and jump into a superhero costume with 007 emblazoned across his chest if the films continue to escalate into such absurdly insane realms.  A Road Runner cartoon is more realistic than the first ten or maybe fifteen minutes of this film - and all this before the credits roll on a way too overwhelming title sequence backed by a completely lacklustre title song.<br /><br />Why do I say the movie is too many movies rolled into one?  Because it definitely feels that way!  Until Javier Bardem makes his grand entrance as a mad mix of the Joker, Hannibal Lecter and Julian Assange, the movie is rather good.  Watching Bond trying to regain the mantle of 007 makes for some rather enthralling viewing. The dissolute Bond playing a danger game with a drink and a scorpion says much without literally saying anything about the need for fulfillment of a danger man's deepest desires even in the face of career degradation.  The photography in these early scenes of Shanghai and Macau by night are breathtaking - as is the photography throughout the entire movie.  However, once the villain comes onto the scene, he marginalizes Bond!  Daniel Craig's Bond seems to shrink in scope and spirit next to Javier Bardem's existential, tortured, scene-stealing bad-ass.  And with this left-hook to the territory come the echoes of too many other films to make SKYFALL make it as one exemplary example in the fifty year Bondian canon.  The last never-ending segments in the Scottish wilderness caused me to have a filmic flashback to STRAW DOGS.  And seeing the great Albert Finney come literally out-of-the-woodwork, I thought I was seeing the ghost of Sebastian Cabot from FAMILY AFFAIR - and deep into the climax of a Bond movie, one shouldn't be thinking of a TV sitcom from ages ago - and yet I was.  I was all over the place because the movie was all over the place.  Some of this ending material even looked like it came out of the Hammer House of Horror.  I half expected Christopher Lee to pop up from the moors and take a bow.<br /><br />I truly liked Daniel Craig in the first of his Bond films.  The second film was witless - so I was hoping for a strong rebound in SKYFALL.  Apart from the plot, Craig's Bond in this film is completely dour and sour. He never smiles or quips - as did the pitch perfect Sean Connery of the seminal films.  Judi Dench is likewise one-note throughout.  There is much more of interest to be found in Javier Bardem's villain.  Once he appears, the film hardly seemed like a James Bond movie anymore. It seems more like a dozen other films - but not truly like a Bond one.  And the CGI lizards belonged on Skull Island!<br /><br />Best scene: the silhouetted battle in a skyscraper twixt Bond and an assassin.  Image and music merged perfectly in this too-short sequence. Too bad the rest of the movie wasn't quite up to snuff.Bond movie, one shouldn't be thinking of a TV sitcom from ages ago - and yet I was.

0345803485|3.0|Ok the sex parts are great. But c'mon the writing style is really annoying. The character reminds me extremely of Bella in twilight but with worse self esteem issues. The way its written seems extremely juvenille. It was kind of one of those books that while your reading it your pretty interested but your not in a rush to finish it.... The main character's obliviousness is also annoying. The book is ok and i still haven't really tried to read the second one.
1250000971|4.0|Some days all I really want is for someone to tell me a wicked-good story, and when that mood strikes me, there is no better author to turn to than Jeffrey Archer.  His books are simple, fast-moving, thoughtless, and well-constructed, while his characters are either very good or very bad, and almost believable.  Archer's major ability is to grab the reader quickly and never let go, and to somehow make the reader care about what happens in the lives of the characters, in short, to make the reader want to know how it turns out.  After quickly finishing Only Time Will tell, the first book in Archer's projected series, The Clifton Chronicles, I immediately picked up and finished the second book, The Sins of the Father.  No doubt about it:  I'll buy each succeeding book as it is published.

1401322786|5.0|Excellent book; couldn't put it down so read it in five hours. Even though it's labeled \\"Fiction\\" and the  story line is fiction, there are points in this book to let us all know that time is precious, should be respected and used in a favorable way and not wasted on material things. Humanity is what's important, taking care of ourselves and others in our life time.  Mitch Album is an excellent writer and I enjoy all of his books.

I have a tendency to struggle with events and reference to other people that were in the first or second book.  Thank you Sylvia Day for a wonderful story. I experienced joy, anxiety, laughter, anger. I shouted at my kindle.  Shouted!  Cannot wait to start the next one.  If you haven't read the first one, it would be better if you did.  I read A Lot and I Do recommend this series.

0307593525|5.0|After watching Julia & Julia (the Movie),I knew I had to find this book. Immediately my hubby looked it up at Amazon and ordered one for me. It must be the one of the best recipe books I've ever owned.<br /><br />Tried many of the recipes and each new one I tried, never fails to bring tears to my eyes...the sheer goodness of the taste of the food! The recipe was spot on...the book may look a bit intimidating at first but once u've tried one recipe, you just can't seem to stop. My all time favourite is her bouillabaise...my guests just can't get enough ofit everytime i serve them this.<br /><br />I've always thought french food would be fussy to prepare. Julia child has proven me wrong. I just love the way she decribed the techniques involved...she's made it so easy to prepare. Even the drawings are so easy to follow!I am truly impressed! I love this book and i believe all cooks who love to entertain should own it!

1449305172|4.0|Despite the suspiciously high percentage of five star reviews within short bursts of time, I am obliged to comment that the author had succeeded to deliver his promise on page xxiv that his book did teach readers of the following:-<br />1. how to first fidn a problem worth solving, before defining a solution<br />2. how to find early customers<br />3. when is the ideal time to raise funding<br />4. how to test pricing<br />5. how to decide what goes into Release 1.0<br />6. how to maximize for speed, learning and focus<br />7. what is product/market fit<br />8. how to iterate to product/market fit<br />Furthermore, I found the \\"Lean Canvas\\", a simple template designed by the author to link thru various questions above, particularly helpful. A helpful book well organized and written. In short, recommended.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find a few of my favorite passages for your reference.<br />The key takeway from Customer Development can best be summarized as: Get out of the building. - Steve Blank pgxxiii<br />Startups that succeed are those that manage to iterate enough times before running out of resources. - Eric Ries pgxxiii<br />The Toyota style is not to create results by working hard. It is a system that says there is no limit to people's creativity. People dont go to Toyota to work, they go there to think. - Taiichi Ohno pg170

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The start of the book seems like its a novel designed for easy reading for teens -- then the consciousnesses matures along with the character about halfway through the book and the narrative becomes more adult.

B00979CS50|5.0|Psychedelic Pill is one of the best original releases from Neil Young in years. It is also one of the best examples of Raga Rock ever recorded. Raga Rock was a subspecies of rock music which flourished for one, brief, brilliant period in the late Sixties and early Seventies. It has been described simply as rock music using Indian musical instruments, but this definition is facile and inaccurate. True Raga Rock utilized tonal melodies and repeated these melodies in riffs that would sometimes go on for a recorded thirty minutes on record; a great genre for jamming. NY has implemented elements of Raga Rock early on in his releases, and this album features these elements in abundance again.<br /><br />The best example of Raga Rock is in the first song, \\"Driftin' Out,\\" a 28-minute lament, which is contemplative and meditative in its hypnotic riffs. This technique is also present to lesser degrees in Ramada Inn,\\" \\"Twisted Road,\\" and \\"Walk Like a Giant.\\"<br /><br />But the album is also, as indicated in its title, Psychedelic, and the distorted tones and swirling speaker-to-speaker resonances are there in the title song and remix in the second CD, also in abundance.<br /><br />The remaining songs, \\"She's Always Dancing,\\" \\"For the Love of Man,\\" and \\"Born in Ontario\\" are basic Neil Young, ably backed by Crazy Horse.<br /><br />In short, any Neil Young fan should grab this CD. For those unfamiliar with his music, this is an excellent start.

0375507256|3.0|Cloud Atlas is not really a novel, and calling the six novella-length stories \\"linked\\" is a stretch. Well written, clever, but just a collection of good, not great, stories. When I finished I felt like I had fallen for a bait and switch. It is like the author had six stories, could not figure out how to package them, and decided to throw in a birthmark and cursory references to the other stories and call it a novel. It's a clever idea, but I did not find any clear themes strong enough to carry the concept through.<br /><br />That being said, my favorite story was The Ghastly Ordeal if Timothy Cavendish - very funny. I found Half-Lives tedious and formulaic and An Orison of Sonmi 451 almost impossible to get through.<br /><br />A problem with having such widely varying styles in one book is that if the reader does not care for one (I do not like mysteries such as Half-Lives), he has to slog through the whole thing to get on to the next part of the story. Also, cutting the stories in half builds suspense, but it can make the second half rather hard to follow when it picks up again, hundreds of pages later (Sonmi, Half-Lives).<br /><br />I was waiting to see the movie until I finished the book, and I still plan to do so. The idea of connections to the future and past is a very interesting one, and I looked hard for them throughout the book. I got the impression that any connections, besides the ones obviously put there on purpose (the birthmark, finding the other's prior manuscript, etc.) seemed to be fairly tenuous and vague. Any collection of short stories from the same author, whether the stories are on the same theme or not, are \\"linked,\\" at least subconsciously, because they came from the same author's mind.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to reading Cloud Atlas, but about halfway through I began to think of it as a gimmicky, never fully realized \\"concept book.\\" I finished it, but ended up being fairly disappointed with it.

Imagine my shock and delight when upon leaving for work I encountered the familiar amazon shipping tape on a box at my doorstep! I had ordered the shoes less than 11 hours prior to receiving them. This made my day and my feet much better. Thank you amazon magicians. I will be back.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This is a very simple ebook with all the information you need to convert a MS Word document, or with reservations, some other word processing apps, into an ebook suitable for the Kindle. From experience, the most important point is to be sure how to prepare your document before starting to write, because the most important thing to know about Microsoft Word is which features MUST be ignored. The problem is, the conversions are never as straightforward as they might be. (And why a program that does nothing else but write cannot produce a version directly suitable for this particular use eludes me.) Another point that this ebook omits is that there are commercial compiling programs out there. However, if you follow these instructions assiduously, and if you are careful with embedding images, etc., you will end up with a clean ebook. I have compiled five ebooks that have landed on Amazon without problems following submission.
B007REV4T8|5.0|An unknown bad guy (Javier Bardem) has obtained the list of all NATO nation covert operatives working inside terrorist cells. As he threatens to release them, an aged Bond (Daniel Craig) who appears to have lost a step, must go to Shanghai and appear in the obligatory casino scene and attempt to get back the computer file. This feature has the standard Bond lines, killer title track, sensual scenes, over the top chase action, as well as a return to Bond's roots.<br /><br />Judi Dench as &#34;M&#34; was superb. Adele singing the title track, who else? The Bond series has kept up with the times as expected and leaves sequel possibilities open. Good action flick, although I do not consider this to be the best Bond film ever or even close. It lacked the fun gag names that makes for great spoofs, but did use Silva, the name of our bad guy from the urban dictionary: Silvas are typically the most handsome men one will ever come across in person. A silva is a strong, sexy, and successful individual that doesn't need anyone but himself. Worth a peek on the big screen.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, sensual scenes that implied sex, no nudity.
B008B9JTLI|4.0|I will admit I picked out this movie to watch because Samuel Jackson plays the main role.  He is a convict who leaves jail after serving 25 year sentence for killing his best friend.  Once out of the jail he wants to go back to living a normal life.  All of his former convict buddies who went back to the life of crime end up dead sooner or later.<br /><br />However, our character just seems not to be able to break away from the people who want to suck him back in to the life of crime.  It is a game of grift and $8MM is at stake.  Too much money to pass and his enemies are willing to pull every trick in the book to pull him back into the game.  There are some quite unexpected twists and turns in the plot as movie goes on.  I enjoyed the movie, I enjoyed the story and Samuel Jackson has pulled this one all by himself.  I just loved his acting.
0307352145|1.0|The writer should have explained this is a book without a story, without any attempt at a \\"connection\\" between subject and those of us who consider ourselves introverts, instead a \\"directory\\" for comments from other writers who have writen on the subject. It was like reading a phone book only more boring...what a waste of my money. Want it? Pay the shipping and its yours...
1594744769|3.0|The premise and format of this book intrigued me right from the start -- a book about children with peculiar talents, told in a combination of prose and found photographs.  I enjoy fantasy books that are set in our own mundane world, and this one promised to be a quirky and entertaining read.<br /><br />The promise failed to deliver, sadly.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the illustrations -- all eerie black-and-white photographs of both ordinary and decidedly unordinary things.  A stark sillhouette of a woman, a baby seemingly floating in midair, a man asleep with a gun in his hand, a pair of creepy clown twins... even the seemingly ordinary things look unsettling and compelling, and the author does his best to incorporate every picture into the story.  Sometimes he has to stretch things awfully hard in order to make them fit, however, and it shows in the story.  (Also, there are two photos of the aforementioned clown twins, but they never really show up in the story.)<br /><br />The story itself showed a lot of promise -- a boy discovers a secret home for \\"peculiar\\" children, those with strange abilities or deformities, which is run by the stern, shapeshifting Miss Peregrine.  It's bogged down by excessive detail, however, and the actual story doesn't get its start until about two-thirds of the way through.  Too much time is spent describing relatively trivial things, and not enough spent on fleshing out the actual story.  And things like the time loops and monsters are never adequately explained.<br /><br />The most disappointing part of the novel is that nothing is resolved by the end -- it ends on a cliffhanger, making it obvious that this book is merely a setup for a sequel.  This is not a good way to write a novel, in my opinion.  I have nothing against series, but in my opinion each book in a series should tell a complete, self-contained story as well as carry on a larger story arc.<br /><br />I give this book an extra star for the high-quality printing and the unique setup and illustrations.  Otherwise it's an intriguing premise that is sadly wasted with too-florid prose and a storyline that doesn't pay off.ing and the unique setup and illustrations.

B004LZF2LW|5.0|I downloaded and installed this app as the FAOTD but I deleted it from my device at the time as I had little use for it. Now that I live in China and have friends in several timezones I find it very useful.<br /><br />It keeps track of not only the time difference but also the date difference and sunrise and sunset times for different zones. Graphically it shows the current day and night status on the globe as well as the time zone boundaries.<br /><br />I would say it is well worth it if you have friends or business associates in different time zones.
0307730697|5.0|I must say this book has been fantastic. \\"Fearless\\" is not just a catchy title: It perfectly describes the life of Adam Brown. I wish I could be as fearless as this father, Christian, and warrior was. In the end, what a model life he has lived. One of triumph over sin and addiction and reaching his ultimate potential, and perhaps, then some. I consider Adam a brother in Christ and cannot wait to meet him in the next life.
0767821629|3.0|Other than raising some philosophical questions (that I think will escape most viewers) this film is really nothing much more than a curiosity. The ending raises questions all its own. Is it just sort of tacked on as a Hollywood type ending or what? A watery world & everything is quite peacefrully resolved for these characters after all the confusion? The film is technically well dome, but the story is a hodge podge. So many loose ends that the ending just ignores.

B004SBBDB2|3.0|Broken, defective and malfunction after used less than 90 days, purchased on August 20, 2012. Suddenly one day it just stopped working as it used to. Either no signal detected by both LCD and plasma. Or if it did get detected, the screen reflection of my iPad on screen is low resolution, tiny little screen box.  I tested it on all my LCD and plasma, all did not work.  This cable is confirmed dead.  Called them and tried to let them know their product quality, surprisingly they replaced it even it already past the replacement / returned due date.  I hope this replacement cable will work fine in long run.  Amazon.com customer service is top class, that why I always shop with Amazon.com. I am impressed but the replacement still not working properly.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|This movie exceeded my expectations.. Not just a chick flick. You can see good dance moves that make you wonder if you could do them.. LOL but not like them!
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I love it because Steven Tyler's always been a huge inspiration, and these guys and our friends from Zeppelin (looking forward to Celebration Day, although it ain't Zeppelin without Bonham, but that's another review in itself) were my best friends in school. Haha, this album wasn't pure gold, but they feel like family, so I gotta love it, and the fat lady hasn't sung just yet. They'll be back. Really my only \\"complaint\\" is 'Freedom Fighter', 'Something', and 'I Just Can't Stop Loving You', for vocals, I come for Tyler. But I suppose, Perry's sang before 'Back Back Train', 'Walk On Down', and 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'. But like I implied, I'm not really complaining. But for the high points, it had a Zeppelin/Stones touch in it, and personally, I loved the ballads, and 'Shakey Ground' is funkadelic. I'd buy it all over again and plan on getting the deluxe edition. Hey, its a hundred times better than that sad excuse for a new Van Halen album, then again, it was all downhill when it turned into Van Hagar, and it was better than Mr. Cooper's sequel album 'Welcome 2 My Nightmare' but I actually enjoyed bits of that one. We all just need to realize that this is a new album, and Aerosmith always goes into a cacoon before whipping out something better, Get Your Wings/Toys In The Attic, Permanent Vacation/Pump, Get a Grip/Nine Lives (say what you will, that album had good points, not my favourite, but still good). So this album wasn't perfect, but they feel like family, and this isn't the end. If anything else, its a great deal better than 'Just Push Play' in which I adored three songs, then went back to Pump. Finally, if I haven't given you enough encouragement already, listen to their first album, the pickings were pretty slim. So there's my review book. There's a bit of a drought, but the floods coming baby. Haha

B009AMAMF2|5.0|I am a Buddhist and I went with a group of fellow Buddhists and Buddhist Monks to see this movie today.<br />Right off there are Buddhist messages all over the place.  Sutras quoted over and over, Buddhist imagery and of course the message of rebirth and Karma.<br /><br />But the problem is that unless you are a Buddhist it is very unlikely that you would pick up on all these undertones and the theme.<br />The general Western public has zero knowledge about Buddhism and the message will be lost on most people.  This is unfortunate because there was a great opportunity here to bring this message to the foreground and introduce people to Buddhist concepts.<br />It's there but so very few people will ever understand what is being told here.  Had they only taken a moment to maybe give people some obvious clues so that the curious could at least have some point of reference to begin asking questions, that would have been great.<br />But the curious are left unfulfilled and empty handed and most people will walk away thinking \\"WTF did I just watch?\\"..<br /><br />That said.  As for the movie itself, be prepared for a great deal of graphic violence and gore.  It was awful and tragic but it was a necessary thing that needed to be shown to illustrate the cruelty and hateful nature of humans and to illustrate Dukkha (Suffering).<br />The six tales illustrate the six realms of suffering and Saṃsāra which is the endless cycle of birth, life, death and rebirth and how several characters attempted to escape that cycle.<br /><br />I cried throughout most of the movie, at the cruelty and suffering and cheered a few parts when some of the characters stood up for themselves and did what they could to put a stop to it, to change the course of their lives.  But I just don't want to say anything else because I do not want to be the one to spoil it for someone else.<br /><br />Trust me on this, take a Buddhist friend with you to see this movie and ask them questions.

B0098VXE50|5.0|Loved it <3!!!!!!!!! Not since Sigourney Weaver in\\"Snow White-Tale of Terror have I found myself so caught up in a \\"scarytale\\" without a fairy tale ending. Chris Hemswoth is soooo hot & charming as the huntsman. Great casting. Kristen Stewart even managed to do some actual acting that IMO hasn't been seen since \\"Speak\\". Although I don't know where she would fit in a sequel. Charlize Theron really did a great service to the role of the Evil Queen. She took \\"wicked witch\\" to a whole other level.  I loved everything from the fabulous costumes, to the awesome special effects & the sets( whether live sets or CG) were phenomenal. The transition from the bleakness of the kingdom to the forest was breath taking. This version of the story will be one of my favorite films of all time. I truly enjoyed this movie & I am very happy to have added it to my vast movie collection ;)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am very interested in the JFK assasination which is why I picked the book to read.  The story was very well written and I felt like I was there experiencing what he was going through.  It wasn't a page turner for me, but that could be b/c it was so long and I knew I wasn't getting to the end anytime soon.  The ending was sweet and made me cry, but I wish it could've been different.  But that's what great stories are about. Overall, I'd definately recommend this to anyone!

B007HU7NBK|5.0|This is such a personal account of his own life and the evolution (from its very birth) of Duran Duran. The book is very easy to read and enjoyable. He really takes the reader on a journey from his very personal point of view. It's like reading his journal, although I'm sure there are a few details he may have left out (LOL).  Duran Duran is one of my all time favorite bands, but I am not being biased. I will not read a book if it doesn't hook me. I was hooked!<br /><br />Here's wishing you many, many more years of music, creativity and passion, JT!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a scientist who's spent 5 decades trying to ascertain the TRUTH about spiritual matters, this book is as compelling as anything I've read.  Partly because Alexander's experiences resonate so well with the stories told by people of the past who had religions founded after them.  Partly because the experiences resonate with incidents told to me personally by a person who gets insights by 'voices' that are as clear and compelling as Alexander's. I have persuaded this person to write down his experiences, including a momentous prediction for the near future.  He has it largely written and documented, so there can be no doubt of the prescience.<br /><br />My science training has taught me to be suspicious of emotional appeals...singing, chanting, pomp and circumstance, and the like, which nearly all established religions have resorted to.  I suspect this is because organizations that become powerful attract those seeking power, not truth.  Such people do not have sensitivity to the spiritual world, and soon the 'religion' veers off to serve the purposes of those leaders.  I ask this question:  How many Temples or Cathedrals did Jesus build?  How many castles?  How many jet planes did he have, or jewel encrusted carriages?  The same can be said of founders of Buddism, Hinduism, and many other 'religions'...at least those that did not advocate conversion by the sword.<br /><br />Science seemed to have all the answers (except personal peace) until flaws started appearing in the fundamental explanation of The Universe, Big Bang, Causality, matter and energy.  It was argued that the Big Bang was a spontaneous event with no cause.  Now, 96% of the Universe is unaccounted for by our senses or direct measurement...leaving dark matter and dark energy to account for the rest.  Now Cosmologists seriously postulate multiple Universes, some on 'Branes' which may be as close as the width of your finger, and if they collide, may spawn a new Big Bang.  That the Big Bang was a spontaneous event with no cause leaves open the possibility that another could occur right where you are standing, at any time...it really wouldn't matter if it occurred many lightyears away.  We'd still be annihilated by it.  Quantum Mechanics has long argued that particles have equal probabilities of being and not being, until measured...that is sensed by consciousness.  Now we also know that Einstein's 'Spooky action at a distance' is possible, and devices are being designed to use it for communication.<br /><br />Seems to me that modern science has left the door wide open for a truth as espoused by Alexander.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A satisfying conclusion - good series of books. I'd recommend it to anyone who liked the first book or the first two books.
014241722X|5.0|As I have stated in a previous review, all of Grisham's legal thrillers deal with the failures of humanity's legal system in some fashion or another. Theodore Boone is his first foray into young adult fiction. In my view, it is a very successful one; Grisham avoids verbose, glib and superfluous legalese, and in doing so, hooks the audience in for more. Although I have read quite the lion's share of Grisham's adult legal thrillers, I enjoyed this new approach.<br /><br />He retains the best aspects of his wordier novels while keeping tension alive during the chapters (which, though brief, are still riveting). There is a description of the difference between circumstantial and non-circumstantial evidence (handled by our hero Theo, of course), Animal Court and the Boone family life (Uncle Ike is unquestionably the most interesting of the bunch).<br /><br />Although the central focus of the book is the trial of Pete Duffy for the murder of his wife, there is nothing that would make it inappropriate for younger children.
B009AMANBA|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />After reading approximately 200 books on the subject, Steven Spielberg's politically correct screenwriter, playwright Tony Kushner, decided it would be best to focus on the last four months of President Lincoln's presidency and the fight over the 13th Amendment, rather than covering Lincoln's entire term in office. Apparently, Spielberg concurred, concluding that a full-blown rendering of Lincoln's presidency would be unwieldy and the more narrow focus would perhaps be more dramatically effective. He could have proffered up a three to three and a half hour spectacle, covering many of the significant bases of Lincoln's political and personal life, beginning with the first Inauguration, with full knowledge that it's been done before quite effectively (I'm referring to Sam Waterston's and Mary Tyler Moore's magisterial performances in the 1988 TV movie adaptation of 'Gore Vidal's Lincoln').<br /><br />First and foremost, what's missing here is little sense of Lincoln's brilliance as a master politician. Since most of the movie focuses on the machinations in the House of Representatives, focusing on the fight over the passage of the 13th Amendment, Lincoln's input is minimal. Tommy Lee Jones, as Radical Republican, Thaddeus Stevens, steals the show with his brilliant performance as the fiery abolitionist representative, who ends up giving up his quest for equal rights for blacks in order to have slavery abolished, with the passage of the 13th Amendment. Spielberg's opus is supposed to be based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, 'Team of Rivals'--but where is the 'team'?<br /><br />All the fascinating characters from Lincoln's cabinet are missing interacting with one another. In the Gore Vidal movie, both Seward and Secretary of the Treasury Chase's political ambitions are dissected and we actually get a sense of what their personalities are like. Here, David Strathairn as Seward, stands around with nothing much to do as Lincoln's adviser. Lincoln actually had to balance the conflicting positions and personalities of the members of his cabinet. This is effectively conveyed in both Gore Vidal's novel and TV adaptation but not at all in Spielberg's 'Lincoln'.<br /><br />Wonderful peripheral figures who are an integral part of the Lincoln story are lost due to Spielberg and Kushner's onerous decision to ignore the earlier history. The 1988 biopic includes them: Kate Chase, Salmon Chases' daughter, who married the \\"boy governor\\" of Rhode Island, millionaire businessman turned General, William Sprague; Senator Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's debate rival; Billy Herndon, Lincoln's former law partner and McClellan, Lincoln's failed first general, who later opposed him in the Election of 1864.<br /><br />Spielberg is more interested in offering up a litany of the arcane--explicating a myriad of one member after the other from the House of Representatives--all extremely minor figures, now lost to history. Spielberg and Kushner spend so much time on the vote in the House of Representatives, as if this is the defining moment of Lincoln's presidency. Perhaps from a modern perspective, yes! But I found it hard to believe that the bells were chiming and there were was a giant parade in pro-rebel Washington, D.C., on the day the 13th Amendment was passed. The real cheering was on April 9, 1865, when the South surrendered. The end of the war was of course the main concern of the people of the time, not necessarily the abolition of slavery.<br /><br />Watching Spielberg's 'Lincoln', one can hardly realize that there was indeed a dark side to our 16th President. The suspension of Habeas Corpus and Lincoln's prosecution of political enemies without due process of law, is an aspect of the Lincoln presidency hardly addressed in Spielberg's flattering hagiography. Lincoln's view of African-Americans was decidedly less progressive than Spielberg lets on here. Even shortly before the end of the Civil War, Lincoln was still entertaining schemes of colonization for blacks in South America and Africa.<br /><br />And what of Mary Todd Lincoln? Sally Field looks a lot more like Mary Todd than Mary Tyler Moore did in the 1988 mini-series, but Moore truly turns the President's wife into a fully-realized character. With Kushner's sketchy script, Field only is able to touch upon a few of the major points of Mary Todd's life in the White House. In the Gore Vidal movie, we actually get to see and FEEL the devastating effect son Willie's death had upon her, as it occurs in real time. Here (like so many of the earlier events during the Lincoln Presidency), it is only alluded to. What's more, Mary Todd's meltdowns (probably today characterized as 'bipolar') are only tangentially dealt with, as opposed to the earlier TV movie, where they are an integral part of the story.<br /><br />Kushner creates a non-part for the character of Elizabeth Keckley, the African-American dressmaker turned servant to Mary Todd Lincoln. In the 1988 biopic, there's actually a relationship shown between the two women, with Keckley morphing into a confidante, in effect acting as a sounding board for Mary Todd Lincoln's actual views on slavery. In Spielberg's 'Lincoln', there's a short unlikely scene where Keckley confronts Lincoln on the front porch of the White House, musing about the future fate of African Americans in the U.S.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis is as good as Sam Waterston back in 1988 but unfortunately he just doesn't have a good script to work with. Probably the best scene in the film is the confrontation between Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens in the White House pantry. But because none of the other 'team of rivals' is developed, Lincoln has hardly anyone to play off of here. Spielberg's attempt to examine Lincoln's personal life also falls flat. The melodramatic scene where he slaps son Robert, feels completely out of character!<br /><br />Before you praise Spielberg's 'Lincoln' to the hilt, go out and purchase Gore Vidal's Lincoln. It's only $4.89 at deepdiscountdvd.com and Sam Waterston is simply excellent as the politician and the man, warts and all! As usual, Spielberg's production values far outshine the low budget efforts on television.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|It took me at least 1/3 of the book to get into this one. But once I got to that point, I couldn't put it down.  Just wasn't the quality of her other books that hold me from the first chapter.  It was good, not great.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|This was the first book I bought on my Kindle and I certainly wasn't disappointed. I loved absolutely everything about this novel: the plot, the pace and the characters. I have read a number of King books previously and the reason I keep coming back for more is that I think he is unparalleled when it comes to creating and sustaining memorable characters and places. The biggest compliment I can pay this novel is that I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book but simultaneously I dreaded reaching the conclusion as it would mean the end of my time in the world of the story.  As a testament to King's storytelling skills he succeeded in making me feel nostalgic for a time and place that I have never inhabited. One criticism I would have of other King novels is that I am rarely satisfied with the endings, however, I think this one is perfect. Prior to 11.22.63 my favorite book by King was 'The Stand' but this one has definitely replaced it at the top of the list.

B005LAII7G|5.0|They (the movie) had me when the three mini vulcan cannons went off - I was screamming my delight.  Please go see this movie if you are an action fan or a fan of Judge Dread or you just like seeing what happens when 3 mini-guns are operating on a single target \\"AWESOME\\".  When the DVD comes out - I plan to throw a party.
B00BGV0Y26|3.0|I have been a fan of Halestorm since the first album came out in 2009 and Izzy is one of the best female rock singers in a long while and has real talent which most of the teen pop and generic r&b on the radio today does not, and she rocks as hard as the guys. this album for me was a downer on first listen since the first album was so good.there are a few  great songs to make the album worth buying. my favorites songs are Love Bites And So Do I Break In which is a very nice ballad Beautiful For You a good modern rock song and In Your Room another ballad which sounds like a rewrite of the 1980's Bangels hit Eternal Flame. Izzy has a very impressive vocal range and sounds the best on the ballads could do without her screaming on some tracks. she is a great singer and does not have to scream like less talented singers out there.some of the songs are weak Here's To Us sounds like teen pop a song  any pop singer could sing it sounds forced. a pure cheesy pop song in a hard rock band is not a good thing ,I Miss The Misery is the other song i don't like  very annoying song not a good melodie it was used in a beer commerical enough said .I hope the new album which i have not heard yet will be an improvement on this album. if your a fan getting into the band buy the first album and the covers ep and then Strange Case Of .i give the album a 3 rating for the good songs I mentioned only and Izzy's great singing and the band's good playing all around on the album!
B009PU2SX8|5.0|This is a great album featuring a new guitarist.  He burns it up.  He is more then a blues player.  He takes todays sounds and blends them in a new way. I give this album 5 stars . A must buy.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|awesome, but needs more time. want to play for more time? delete it by holding your finger on it and click remove from device. then reinstall it! also,I threw a snowball at a polar bear...  IT DID NOT THINK IT WAS FUNNY!!!!!!!!
B000T6VVP8|5.0|My 3-year-old grandson loved this toy.  He loved it so much his other grandparents had to go buy the Duplo First Fire Station.  The only drawback is you need to acquire an inexpensive plastic tub with a snap-on lid to keep the pieces under control when not in use.  This set came with a little \\"flame\\" and an axe.  Those two pieces were his favorites.  He was terribly upset when he lost the axe for a while in the house.  Luckily we found it.  What he wants this year is more \\"Duplos\\".
B0098VXE50|5.0|This movie is awesome.  The acting and special effects are very well done. Chris Hemsworth makes an awesome Huntsman as well as he does Thor! Charlize Theron makes a wonderful evil queen and Kristen Stewart is good as Snow White. Great movie and a great cast!
B008O9V4C2|4.0|The years since his last solo album in 2006 have obviously given Fagen time to decide in which direction to head for his fourth. In the long gaps between the same old, same old Steely Dan summer tours, I think he's come up with the album he's always wanted to do on his own for a long time - let's loosen up and have some FUN. In traveling pretty far from classic Dan (but sneaking in some signature riffs, of course), Fagen and and new, multi-instrumental producer Michael Leonhart have created a bluesy/soulful relaxed album. His voice is so strong and agile he could be 30 years younger. As with many of the other reviewers, it did take a few listenings to really get it. I thought it was a bit boring and repetitive at first. But on the third go-round it became clear that his goal was, in fact, to simplify, simplify and most of all lay down a strong groove. This was nicely and subtly layered with classy, interesting arrangements that were complex but subtle. Fagen and the funk were appropriately kept up front. There was a nice consistency throughout, with the exception, I thought, of \\"Memorabilia\\" with its too-long narrative of WWII atomic mistakes and Issac Hayes' \\"Out of the Ghetto,\\" the only song not written by Fagen. It's a gem, and ironically, the musicians, especially the great Freddie Washington on bass, make it the funkiest of all of them. But both songs appeared to be dropped in without a connection to the whole. My favorite is \\"I'm Not the Same Without You,\\" which turns the usual (he/she left me and I'm really messed up), on its head. It's totally exhilarating in its imagery (\\"Since you've been gone, it's like somebody switched the stars back on\\"), and best of all, Fagen sounds so genuinely HAPPY. And who but Fagen could have come up with a song which succesfully includes his lover's betrayal, climate change (referencing Al Gore) and some old hippies giving him advice about handling his pain (\\"Weather in My Head\\"). There were some weaknesses. Though \\"Earl Cooke Jr.\\" (Michael Leonhart) on drums was a rock, the bass was not brought out enough. Not enough bass, not enough funk. It would also have been more interesting to change up the rhythm a bit more often. Great grooves can be laid down in many different pockets. This album made me think of \\"Hey Nineteen.\\" Almost all of the tunes include an older man (guess who) involved with or hot for an exciting but elusive young woman. But he's also accepting the natural limitations of his aging. There is a poignant, honest and even frequently humorous acknowledgment of who and where he is now, most obviously in \\"Slinky Thing\\", \\"The New Breed,\\" and \\"Miss Marlene.\\" Sunken Condos is Donald Fagen's most heartfelt album. And you can hear him singing a sigh of long-needed relief.Jr.\\" (Michael Leonhart) on drums was a rock, the bass was not brought out enough. Not enough bass, not enough funk.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton never disappoints with her historical details and beautifully woven stories. This one moves back and forth between the London Blitz, post war 1940's, to today, never missing a beat with stories within stories, refreshing turns of phrase, and plenty of plot twists and turns. I never miss a new Kate Morton novel!
0920668364|1.0|I didn't read the reviews, and thought this book (since it's always so highly recommended)involved a mother simply rocking her baby to sleep, then singing the song to him as he got older. Instead she is sneaking into his room, then into his house (through a window) to continue to rock him- I found the book disturbing and not something I wanted to read to my daughter-- I don't think it is ok to sneak into your adult child's room, let alone break into their house, and don't find anything endearing or sweet about those actions. The song was cute, I wish the storyline was less disturbing.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|I would love to be able to use this in my college classes and take notes.  I feel like a word processor application should at the very least offer bullets and numbering.  I will change my review to a 4 or 5 star IF this is fixed.  Please fix this.  This app has so much potential, but this really is a deal breaker.

B008WCP2PG|1.0|This movie was not as good as I had expected or hoped. I watched it yesterday (11/11/12) and found myself fast forwarding through the slow parts (which there were several). I would've been satisfied with it just being a \\"dancing\\" movie.  I didn't get any storyline or point to this movie.  I was mainly looking forward to seeing sexy men \\"shake it,\\" and I barely got to see that!  I wouldn't suggest anyone to watch, let alone BUY this movie.  Glad I got it from Redbox......though the $1.30 was still too much.  Glad I didn't go to the theatre to see it. I would've been highly pissed.
B0054SMID0|5.0|All I can say is just watch this... you will not be disappointed.  Some movies are better the less you know about them so watch it!

0316228532|4.0|This is a great little story about a small town and how much people are tied to each other, for better or worse.<br /><br />Rowling starts off with a bang (a death) and then uses that to introduce the rest of the characters bit by bit until it culminates with all of the secrets and ties coming out. At first, it's a bit confusing who is who - it's like you've dropped into the middle of the story. But then, as the story unfolds, everything becomes clear little by little. It definitely has a very adult story-line and there's quite a bit of foul language used by the 'lower classes' (more as a tool to show the class differences than for gratuitous cursing, I think).<br /><br />Overall, this is not \\"Harry Potter\\" for sure, but rather a very adult story with interesting characters and a fascinating story that is teased out over the course of the book. The writing is very good, with some very clever bits of description and wit, and great characters. Well worth reading - looking forward to more in this vein as well.
B0008ENHUI|1.0|The sound is really bad and even with the volume raised all the way you can barely hear the audio.  Totally ruined the movie experience.  Not worth the money.
B0073QYC2G|2.0|We've purchased several Schleich Dinosaurs for our son, but this particular model seemed of  a different line or series - no \\"scale model\\" of a 6 ft man, so information booklet, and very lightweight plasticky construction.  Al the other dinos are fairly solidly made (can be pretty painful, actually :-).  We retuned this model and foud a different Giganotosaurus on Amazon.  Seller was great, the product did ship promptly and arrived before promised date, just not the same product as expected

B00007K02F|3.0|I like William Hurt he is a great actor however he didnt make a good Rochester he certainly did not look the part Charlotte was A dull Jane no chemistry between the two I love all the Jane Erye movies the only ones that go by the book is the Dalton And Clark version 1983and Stephens and Wilson so far are the best the others are good love stories I still enjoy watching.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|How is she the most beautiful maiden of them all, she looks like a troll.  The troll in the movie look better then her.  That is no the real reason to hate this movie, no wait it is.  She can't act and she is a princess locked away in a tower for many years.  But some how when she breaks free she is this master swords women. Who is able to kill the queen, that is this all powerful witch. Don't worry this is not spoiling anything that you could figure out form just watching the trailer.  Overall look is good, visual effects were amazing along with the 3D elements.
B001IWV030|1.0|well I really expected this to be a funny movie, given the reviews as well as the stellar cast.  But, aside from a couple of SMALL laughs and the surprise ending, this movie is a DUD.  The jokes and the plot both fall flat.  Ugh I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this one.  Major disappointment!!!
B009KHBDUU|2.0|Started off very interesting and had some funny moments, but was still missing something.  The main issue is trying to have a comedy and horror movie at the same time cant really be done.  It's just to weird and doesn't help advance the plot or the characters.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|The older kindle app worked perfectly on my LG optimus, but the up-to-date version is such a memory hog that it freezes my Samsung. Totally disappointing! An e-book reading app should not do that. I can use Aldiko and Google Play Books with no problem, but I have a kindle e-reader and want my books in sync on my phone. Please fix it Amazon!

1451696191|2.0|Very disappointed in the whole book.  It was not written well, and did not meet my expectations.  The story was very slow and very dismal.  I am so sorry I read it.  How it made the Best sellers List, I have no idea.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|Its slow start with understated humor pulled me in. Its ability to poke fun at all kinds of institutions we hold dear made me like it. Its quiet examination of how we raise brilliant children made me love it. At times I laughed so hard I had to pause the movie. Moonrise Kingdom is a sleeper on par with Princess Bride.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Many movies, after they make a box office hit, in order to milk the cow, they reach to sequal number 10 then they go back in time to show beginings. Such as Star Trek and Star Wars, Silence of the Lambs which focused on Lectar( Anthony Hopkins' character)? Anyway, you got the idea. This movie explains where the Aliens came from. It really makes a believable case to show origins of Alien species. Special effects are really good and acting are above average as well. Naturally, movie ended with a hope a new sequal might be made. it is child friendly movie too. No nudity, but some F--- bombs exist. You may also look at this movie from political perspective too. As liberals will insist, our creators are some humanoids from a different planet, not God. And in this movie, our creators were not pleased with people on Earth and they were planing to exterminate us. Ergo the future sequal, because one of the charactors of the movie is on the way to this human cretors' planet to find out why they wanted us death, even though they created us. Over all, it is a nice entertaining movie and if you ask me, that's thereason we should watch movies: To be entertained.

0345803507|2.0|The first book was ok, sex scenes not as steamy as my friends that read the book made it out to be. I've had more steamy sex than that. Second book meh. Third book...same stuff all over again. The whole repetition is annoying. Every other page I'm reading about this inner goddess. The \\"Mr. Grey, Ms Steele thing is getting annoying.\\" And how in the world is it ok to have a boyfriend who wants to eventually beat you and gets jealous in 0-60? This is kinda sending a message to young girls that its ok to have an abusive boyfriend as long as he's beautiful and has money. Sorry ladies, not every woman can relate to these books. And curly copper hair is NOT my cup of tea.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Actually saw this in theaters when first released and loved it! Since I had to sit under hair dryer from more than one hour, decided to download onto iPad and watch again. Everytime I watch it, it makes me pay more attention to not being so wasteful with resources and generating so much trash (i.e., I try not to let water run as I'm washing dishes, will wash and re-use plastic utensils, print documents double-sided, etc.) A good family movie that could, perhaps, teach children not to be so wasteful AND the danger/consequences of greed. Highly recommend.

0062127241|1.0|I love the Who. I love, love, love the band. Unfortunately, this comes across as a casual conversation about nothing. There aren't any revealing passages about Rickenbackers, his recording technique or secrets about the band that he made famous. Before you know it, he is talking about Tommy, but I was still waiting to hear more about the first record. He moves too quickly and generalizes too often. I wanted insights into the music, the airplanes, the backstage antics, and the mysteries within the band. An opportunity is missed here.

0385535147|1.0|Alas, the John Grisham we grew to love with his early books has retired, leaving in his place a formulaic hack who doesn't even bother with the formula.  This book reads as if it has been deeply abridged, omitting major chunks of plot and all character development.  The early books showed us plot intertwined with character.  This book has neither. The only suspense is whether a believable story will ever emerge. Alas. . . .
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great ,fast paced read.  It reminded me of The Firm.  If you like Grisham, and I do, you will like this book.
B006T3RM08|1.0|I'm really impressed with this dock.  I worried about paying so much for a plastic frame.  However, after a few weeks of use, I'm very pleased with the design, and the utility of a wireless kbh/trackpad for my living room Mini Mac and 60\\" HDTV display is well worth the price.  The keyboard and trackpad snap very snugly into the frame, to the point where once assembled, it feels like one integral unit.  I followed the advice of some reviewers and turned on tap-to-click (and two-fingers to right-click) at the outset.  I've found that I prefer this to explicit click, and have since changed my Mac laptops to work the same way.  One unanticipated benefit is the silence.<br /><br />Now, if I can just find a way to keep the cat from attacking the TV to try to get the mouse cursor...<br /><br />UPDATE Less than one month later:  Changing from 5 to 1 starts.  The trackpad now consistently (=every single time) reports Connection Lost whenever it is inserted into the Clique.  The Clique button that presses the Trackpad button has no effect.  I can not determine why this is happening, but I don't need to these type of problems when I pay $30 for what amounts to a plastic frame.  I'm going to contact the manufacturer.... we'll see how that goes.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I contacted Henge support.  Received a PDF troubleshooting guide in a few hours.  I followed the simple instructions - to scrape excess plastic from the frame where it meets the bottom of the trackpad.  I followed the instructions and filed it down in a few places where it was very rough.  Slipped the trackpad back in, and viola - it works perfectly again, even the right and left click feature (although I've since learn to love tap-to-click and the 3-finger select/drag).  If the product keeps working perfectly for the next month, it earns another star back :)  I taking the time to both with this because a good wireless keyboard/trackpad essential to the Mac Mini-based home theatre environment I'm creating.<br /><br />UPDATE: This is a complete piece of junk.  Neither the trackpad OR the keyboard will connect at all when snapped into the Henge dock.  This is a consistent problem.  If I snap either the keyboard or trackpad into the Henge, I immediately get a \\"Disconnected\\" message on my Mac.  How can this be?<br /><br />You know, this is a single piece of plastic.  Should be fairly low-tech.  It shouldn't take me having to remove barbs around the edged of the frame.  It should only take me picking up the keyboard and always having it work.  This product totally fails in that regard.  I appreciate good and bad reviews at Amazon.  This could have been a nicely conceived product, but its execution is simply awful.  If I could give it the 0 starts it deserves, I would.  It is going into the garbage - totally squandered money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker is a great follow up to the first book, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\".  I loved this book and tore through it rather quickly.  The love story continues!!

B00095NX9G|5.0|This dvd is great, not just for its instruction but also production quality. So far, it has the best production of any dance dvd I own.  I am new to belly dance and I try to do different parts of this dvd twice a week and also have a weekly class and mix up various dvds to add. I think what is good about a dvd is that you can rewind and replay certain parts. And, she also explains without taking too long and does the steps a few times before changing it or adding something else, which is helpful to know what you are practicing on and how to do it. I also recommend this dvd do to the yoga sections, which I do with the drills and instructions or on their own. She also has a lot of performances to watch. I have only taken classes a few months and am not advanced enough to do everything she does, but I got the dvd with the goal of doing them later. I do her things, plus some Tribal Fusion Fundamentals conditioning and exercises to build my balance and strength ahead of when I hopefully learn more difficult techniques. I believe Rachel Brice backs up her reputation and her fame as being both a great dancer and instructor.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This novel was a hoot.  The plot is just what the title suggests, and the book is well-written and fun to read.  Scalzi doesn't take himself too seriously here.  It gets more serious toward the end, but he pulls it off.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Thought this was a very interesting movie about dragon's that was really different than the usual. There's even some pretty decent CG in this movie. Just imagine, digging a hole and finding a live dragon that you then release.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I really liked this movie. I am an action movie junkie and this movie had the action to keep me interested.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This DVD is incredible.  I purchased the 10th anniversary edition 15 years ago in VHS format and it had remained my favorite all that time.  I was fortunate to have seen the show on Broadway some time back and this new DVD and the talent represented by the cast is just fabulous.  The quality of the blu-ray DVD and sound is a huge cut above the old VHS version.  What a wonderful show.  It hasn't lost a bit of it's appeal in all these years.  The reunion of former casts at the end along with the creators was a real bonus.  The only way to enjoy this show more is to see it live in New York or London.
0321701763|4.0|I am self taught when it comes to all adobe products so I purchased this to teach myself what I had been missing. A few of the things I already understood but even with those items like the filters, I felt like it taught me a new way to apply it.<br /><br />The lessons were informative and walked you through each step and had photos. The sidebars have tips that teach you shortcuts or different things about the software.<br /><br />As someone that is fairly new to this software, I felt like I learned a lot and would suggest this to others attempting to learn the software. It doesn't go into great depth about the functions but it gives you a relatively good overview of what you can do with Photoshop. Each lesson took between 30-90 minutes and at the beginning of each chapter it told you about how long the lesson would take, which I found useful.<br /><br />**I did glance through the CS6 book and it seems most, if not all, of the lessons were the same. They had the added features of CS6 but I am glad I did not purchase the CS6 book in addition to CS5, I would have been a little ticked to get the same material with just a few updates.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book. It is an easy read and I loved the relationships between all the characters. It kept my interest and the more I read the more I didn't want to put it down.If you likes Shades Of Grey this book is right up your alley!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a thoughtful book full of feeling. I loved every page and could not put it down. It would be especially wonderful for a person of high school age to read.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. It was recommended to me by a friend. I had never heard of it prior. I looked on Amazon and figured for the price even if I didn't like it I could just leave it in my movie collection. So incredibly happy I made the decision to purchase. I love this movie. Countless laughs. Highly recommend it!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie is great! It's like I'm watching Alien all over again! The storyline is terrific and the shock value is just as good.<br /><br />The PQ and AQ are excellent! The extras are quite good too. It's packed with Deleted & Alternate Scenes, Commentary Track and some Video Files (supposed Weyland's video files) are kinda good but I'd prefer more of `em especially some background info on the set designs, alien designs, CGI development, etc. It's all incorporated in the 4-disc set release but not in this release.<br /><br />I feel that this is the better version of the pre-Alien films, one with more depth and essence than the AvPs (not that it was totally horrible! It was entertaining too...in it's own way but not as great as Prometheus). I'm hoping that Mr. Ridley is gonna get involved with the Prometheus sequels and not let it go vary like what happened to the post Alien and Aliens movies...
B007SGM084|5.0|I never get entranced by the popular trilogies, but I must say I am glad I have. I wish I had Ana's love life!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I've finally got it! The modern epic movie...4 years and 5 movies in the making and I loved how they manage to make it all \\"fall into place\\"!<br /><br />The PQ and AQ are tremendous!!! I drool over the crisp video and audio quality everytime I watch it!!! The Extras in this version of Avengers release is quite good mostly due to the Deleted & Extended Scenes. Loved the contents in here! There's also the interesting Commentary Track & Featurettes, the cool Soundgarden Music Video, the funny Gag-Reel and the weird one on Item 47...but truthfully, I was expecting more! Maybe it's on the Disney Second Screen but I haven't had the chance to load it yet. I find it quite inconvenient. Why can't they just have the damned thing on the disc instead of having to fiddle with another device while watching the movie?! Anyways, since this release comes with the Digital Soundtrack and Digital Copy of the movie in the extra DVD disc I'm gonna give it quite high marks still.<br /><br />I can't comment much about the 3D version of the film coz I don't have a 3D capable TV & blu-ray player set but since it was going for USD0.04 more than the 2D version why miss the chance, right?!<br /><br />I didn't quite like the way the packaging though...since the blu-ray and 3D blu-ray and kept back-to back on one leaf and the DVDs are kept back-to-back on the other leaf. I'm afraid that it would be prone to scratches! :(<br /><br />All-in-all it's still worth to buy and proudly kept in your collection...and it's one of those rare movie which I believe comic book and non-comic book fans will enjoy!
B0086HGW42|5.0|He is like Mraz but with great lyrics and talent all around. He is definitely a new artist I would like to see in concert.
031250926X|5.0|Great book for children. Worth the price!!  Great for repetitive learning and gets the kids to interact. Great for learning colors too. Highly recommend.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This is the 5th time I have read this book, first time on the Kindle.  I was impressed how well it translated.  Each section of the book starts with quotes that resemble newspaper columns and it look stellar on the screen.<br /><br />As to the book, still hard pressed to decide which I find more entertaining.  If I'm reading \\"The Stand\\" its my favorite, if I'm reading \\"IT\\" its my favorite.  Both stories are similar in the sense that they both have good vs. evil theme and endearing characters you can't help but love and root for.  Both have to make a stand at the end against all odds.<br /><br />The nostalgic leanings of the story lends credit to King's storytelling abilities and you can't help feeling that you know what it was like to live in America in the late 50's.  I really reminds you how special it was to be a kid and how magic the world is to us before we heaven forbid become \\"grownups.\\"  For example, \\"Big Bill's\\" near suicidal runs on Silver while the new Bicycle playing cards bang out machine gun like pops as he races through intersection after intersection barely missing oncoming death in the form of tons of 50's steel.  Can't remember how many times as a kid I would beg my Mom to let me have some of their newer playing cards and clothespins to clip them into the wheels.  She would always reply \\"you know money doesn't grow on trees, use some of your duplicate baseball cards like I did growing up.\\"  Another fun and integral part of the tale is you can almost hear the old rock n' roll tunes as background music.<br /><br />You can literally feel how evil Derry really is and how \\"IT\\" has such an impact on daily life in this sinister little 50's town.  When the kids go into the sewers the fear is almost palpable and you can almost smell the grime, muck, and raw sewage.<br /><br />Another aspect like \\"The Stand\\" that I like about \\"IT\\" is that this story offers insight into the Dark Tower and more importantly the Guardians of the Beams.<br /><br />All in all, oneof his best stories.  While quite long, don't be intimidated by this.  You will turn the pages so fast you'll be disappointed at how quick the story seems to end.  I highly recommend this story to anyone, King fan or not.  While some might call it \\"blood and guts gruesome\\" this aspect plays such a small part to the overall tale, its hard to be squeamish.  Five stars for sure.  Don't pass go, don't collect $200.00, go straight to the Amazon Kindle Store and buy it NOW!  You'll love it and feel like its the best $10.00 you've spent in a long time.
B005HSL626|5.0|Easy, fun and free!!  Fun for the whole family. My 2 yr old can play better than me. Great sound effects too, that's what keeps him entertained.
B007XH6BPG|4.0|I bought this because I'll buy anything that Chris Squire plays on. But his playing on this CD is completely unlike anywhere else - understated, buried, sparse. Supporting the melody instead of being independently melodic. \\"Hold Out Your Hand\\" it isn't. Can't even tell whether he's using the Rickenbacker. But the big surprise is, despite all that, I still like the CD very much and play it a lot.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its just great u dont have to go to setting to c how much battery u have left and has a lot of info i reccomend it
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I like this game,  but the ads are too much.  They pop up unexpectedly and because you are in the middle of playing you hit them by mistake.  I am fine with ads at the bottom, side, etc. but putting them in the middle of the screen is too much.  Deleted the app because of them!
B008D19WBQ|1.0|As a dedicated Friends fan, I currently own all 10 seasons on DVD and have watched them more times than I can count. I watch Friends almost every night before going to bed. In fact, I have watched the DVD's so much that many of them have become scratched and skip. I was so incredibly excited for Friends to finally release on blu-ray! My parents were planning to buy this for me for Christmas; however, once my mom read that these were not the full episodes as they are on the DVD's she knew I would not like this and immediately alerted me. Needless to say, I am more than a little disappointed and my parents, nor myself, will be wasting the money on something that is only done halfway. Considering that most of the people who would purchase this are die hard Friends fans, this was a terrible mistake and will hurt your sales exponentially! You lost this sale.
B008RNGCAO|5.0|Awesome its just awesome it will blow your balls off , yeah its that awesome. Did i mention that this was awesome?
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I loved these books! I found them to be really easy to read, yet addictive. As i finished one, I was quick to pick up the next one.<br /><br />They were the cause of many different emotional responses; sadness, laughter, anxiety, frustration, anger.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend these to anyone looking for a new series to read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As strange as it may sound to some/most people.  This book series is actually a good love story.  They can do without the \\"F' word so much, but other than that, it is an interesting love story.

B008Y1YKE4|3.0|Arthur Christmas(released Nov/11)stars the voice talents of Hugh Laurie,Bill Nighy,Robbie Coltrane,Joan Cusak,Michael Palin and many others.It is an ambitious animated film,and therein lies its' biggest fault;it is  TOO ambitious.The story is overly complicated and filled with gags that after a time fall completely flat.By the time you get to the end you don't care whether Arthur reaches his goal or not.<br />The story revolves around the principal named character of Arthur who is one of the current Santa's sons.His other son Steve runs the control center and is boss over the elves.Steve has become quite ambitious and feels that he is the only rightful heir to becoming the new Santa this year.However when Santa arrives home he announces to one and all he is looking forward to going out next year,much to Steve's chagrin.<br />Son Arthur is kind of the klutz of the family,who has had various jobs within the organization over the years,never settling into one very long.However this year he is Santa's official letter writer.Santa retires to bed,but it comes to Steve's attention that one present has been left undelivered.He tries to downplay it,even convincing his father not to pay attention to it.However Arthur gets wind of it,then Arthur's grandfather,who says he will help Arthur deliver that present in his old sleigh(Santa now uses an ultra sleek and cloaked spacecraft to do his work).<br />Of course Arthur's grandfather has not ridden his sleigh for years and alot of mix ups and upsets occur at first.Eventually they end up stranded on a beach in Cuba as the sleigh circles the earth upside down with,by this time,only three reindeer.By this time most of the North Pole has come alive with the buzz about the undelivered present,embarrassing Steve ever the more.The elves even wake Santa up from his sleep,who confronts Steve and before you know it Santa,Mrs.Claus and Steve are winding their way to deliver the present(a better model of bicycle than Arthur has to deliver).<br />Steve and company end up in the same spot in Mexico that Arthur had been to earlier.Their destination is a town in Cornwall,England and they must hurry before time runs out.<br />Meanwhile Arthur has gained control of the sleigh,picked up his grandfather and they are in the town in Cornwall and attempting to get there with little time left.Arthur arrives just as the sun is peaking over the hills,threatening to wake up the girl the bike is destined for.Santa's ship arrives to block out the sun,which saves the day.Steve,Arthur,Santa and Santa's father invade the home to deliver the bike on time.Arthur asks his dad to stay and watch the girl open her present.It is then apparent by the look on Arthur's face,and his unflinching dedication,that HE should be the new Santa.<br />The animation is quite detailed and very clear,which enhances its' entire look.But this film has just got so many little things going on,they become repetitive and unfunny.How many times does a sleigh have to over-turn to become unfunny?How many near misses does a sleigh have to have to become unfunny,despite the screams of its passengers?And Steve,Santa's own son,becomes a very unlikable character as the movie progresses.He becomes very ambitious,selfish and quite uncaring towards Christmas and children in general.We dislike him not only because of his off-putting personality,and his proclivity towards the modern,but because we expect more from a son of old Saint Nick.By the time the film ends,you can bet your children will be antsy in their seats and one does really not care whether Arthur delivers the present on time,as we have lost our vested interest in the proceedings a long time before.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes and an elf recruitment vid.<br />All in all,while the animation is good,the story,the gags and the characterizations leave alot to be desired.This movie will have the small fry squirming intheir seats not too far into it.Not recommended.2 1/2-3 stars.their seats not too far into it.Not recommended.2 1/2-3 stars.

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Jumpers(released Feb/08)stars Hayden Christensen (Max Thieriot) as David Rice,Rachel Bilson (AnnaSophia Robb) as Millie Harris,Samuel L. Jackson as Roland Cox,Jamie Bell as Griffin,Diane Lane as Mary Rice,and others.This Doug Liman directed film is an uneven effort,which never seems to build up any steam for any length of time,thus losing the interest of the viewer very quickly.<br />The film opens as a younger David Rice is in high school.A bully throws a snow globe onto some ice,which David retrieves.However the ice gives way and the current pulls him under.Just as he is about to drown he teleports himself into the local library.From here he tries to understand his new found abilities.He runs away from home and goes to live in New York where he robs banks in order to survive on his own.<br />years pass and it seems his jumping has not gone unnoticed,as one Roland Cox is the head of an agency that tracks and kills jumpers.On a return trip to his apartment he is confronted by Cox who tries to rope him with steel cables which are electrified,to prevent him from jumping.He barely manages to get away and flees home.He meets up with his old flame whom he escorts to Rome.While in the Coliseum he meets up with another jumper called Griffin.He explains the folks after him are Paladins(have gun will travel?),an ancient order dedicated to wiping out all jumpers.In short order the two confront two such men,but escape.They escape the Paladins,but not the local police who arrest David.While in jail his mother visits him and releases him.He takes his girlfriend to the airport and she flies home alone.<br />David and Griffin form a brief partnership to get Cox.Meanwhile Cox has attempted to kill David's father,who he finds and takes to a hospital.David then returns to his girlfriend and snatches her away to Griffins hideaway.But jumpers leave slight openings which Cox uses to find them with.A fight ensues resulting in Millie's capture.David returns to her but is captured.He teleports part of the building to the river in which he almost drowned in years before,then back to the library.However Cox has been pulled along with him and he teleports him to a remote cave above the Grand Canyon.<br />The film ends as David visits his mother and she explains she is in fact a Paladin also,and gives him a head start.David and Millie jump to a destination unknown.<br />The film ends abruptly and I thought there was more coming when it did.There are a ton of unanswered questions in this film,the least of which is David's mother.It appeared to me she was also a jumper,but she turns out to be a Paladin too,who normally don't have that ability.David apparently first jumped at five,but for some unknown reason doesn't remember that.What five year old wouldn't recall such a thing when he grew up? At one point the older David is looking at a TV new story about people stranded in a river atop a car,with the reporter questioning as to how they could be rescued.I thought the next scene would be David jumping there to at least do SOME good,instead of just taking(money)and living off the avails of others.But the film just breezes past it.The questions go on and on.As said previously it is a hodge podge of a film that never leaves you invested in the characters for any length of time whatsoever.Even the wonderful filming locales such as Rome or in Egypt couldn't make up for the interest loss.It's as if the filmmakers didn't have much of a vested interest in making it the film themselves,which translated into apathy on screen.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include:commentary,an animated graphic novel of Davids story,three featurettes and some deleted scenes.This two disc set contains the film disc and extras and a digital copy.<br />All in all a film with lots of potential but with a lacklustre script and execution by its makers.You soon lose any interest in the characters,which inevitably will sink a film faster than a cement block in the Hudson.2 1/2 - 3 stars.lock in the Hudson.2 1/2 - 3 stars.

B008YZXYY2|5.0|this cd rips and also comes with the standard depressing feel that corey seems very good at! some people didn't care for the more mellow audio secrecy, even though that one grew on me as it has very good songwriting, this album hits hard from the drop and is much heavier than audio secrecy! i am really looking forward to part 2! not many good heavy metal bands left but these guys are very good!

PISSED BEYOND that i have to wait until MAY!!!! :O :O
B008458O3S|5.0|This is the best puzzle game on android devices. I know there's a hella ton of puzzle games out there but I still think my statement holds. Somewhere between a perfect difficulty curve, elegant sound design, clever features (such as the ability to work on/save multiple solutions) makes it the best. Plus, I'm colorblind so I'm very thankful for the colorblind mode, and it seems like thy are too because I just got an achievement for using it!
B009439HEY|5.0|See my full review at: wajobu [dot] com<br /><br />Can-utility and the Coastliners, Lamia and especially Eleventh Earl of Mar have new life.  The one thing some (purist) listeners might find missing in GRII is the grittiness of the original recordings, but the defects of these compositions from long ago have been deftly exorcized, and the sonic foundations treated with such care that Hackett not only preserves the legacy of his former band, but enhances it for future listeners.  These recordings are not meant to replace the originals; they are akin to variations by composers of the past.  In a way, Steve Hackett is the archivist of the musical spirit of Genesis from that time.  Sit back and enjoy this brilliantly crafted set of recordings with all the 21st century enhancements.
0316212377|4.0|This is a solid novel of the Culture, with some interesting insights into how it was formed, and why all the culture is the way it is. I did love some of the battles, not so one-sided as most battles involving Culture ships and drones are. The pacing was a bit slow in parts for my taste though, and I didn't find the characters as interesting as those in Surface Details.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|but so far it's good -- just want to know the memory techniques, slow getting to, but the story is somewhat fascinating. There are definitely all types in this crazy world!

B008458O3S|5.0|I am really digging this game. It's kind of like a few color matching games where you have lines cross each other to form new colors but with a twist of trains instead. I am not finding it that difficult of a game and quickly blasted through the first 2/3's of the cities. It's getting harder now but I think I can complete the entire game in less than 2 hours.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|This season is very similar to season 6 to me. It starts of good but I lost interst in the story about half way through. What saves this show, same as last season, is the humor. The banter between Sam and Dean is always top notch.
B007704HO6|5.0|A great read that warms the heart, soul and mind. Two lost souls that found each other and survived. Best wishes both,
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like this game a lot it has good graphics and is fun to play. I have pet shop story too and this is pretty much the same just with dragons. The only complaint I have is some quests don't have the things you need in the market and it takes forever to get enough coins to do anything.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Usually I don't like lots of pockets, since I forget where I put everything, but the design of this backpack changes that paradigm.  The location of the pockets are very logical and very useful.<br /><br />The zippers are always another concern.  The zippers on this backpack are tough.  I like the handy large blue pulls also, nice touch.<br /><br />I like the main divider as well.  Prior to this backpack, I had a man purse and a backpack.  Now I can put it all in this pack and everything is neatly divided.<br /><br />The eyeglass/sunglass is another nice feature.  Again the placement works well for me.<br /><br />I like the lower rear pocket idea for computer wires, etc.  I've used it.  It works well.<br /><br />Inside there are addltional slip folders, one of these is for the computer, and another for an iPad.  I've found other uses for these. There's even a small slip pocket in the rear small container.<br /><br />This backpack may seem a bit costly, but I've found the extra cost to be well worth it.  Thule really sweats the details.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

6305807086|4.0|Some majorly creative thinking produced this MAJORLY creative movie. I saw this movie when it broke and just purchased it to see it again. I remembered I liked it and, after just watching it again, I liked it again. JOHN MALKOVICH is VERY GOOD in this film. ALL performances are strong (John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and Orson Bean).<br />A portal is found to enter the BRAIN of John Malkovich. And enter it they do. This is not a movie for every one (read the reviews). BUT, I liked it and think it's funny. It's, certainly, ORIGINAL.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I never write reviews but these headphone are very cheaply made. I label myself as a very causal online gamer (I'm in my 30's). On a average I play 2-3 times, 1-2 hours total for the month. So I was surprised today when I tried to get a few games in Black Ops before Black Ops 2 is released in a few hours. The PX21's just broke right where the headphone and ear piece connect. Ill post pictures above so everyone can see.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Wonderful novel! Typical Cornwell/Scarpetta. I could not put the book down. My first read of a Patricia Cornwell novel on my Kindle. I loved it. I have read every book she has ever written and will continue to do so. I highly recommend it. I find myself constantly trying to figure out the ending before I get there. It hardly ever happens and it didn't happen with The Bone Bed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great continuation of the book..\\"Bared to you\\".. The only thing wrong was that I read it in 1 week!  The story continues with the main characters and then some.  Ms.Day's storytelling grabs a hold of you and does not let go until you turn the last page. I enjoyed reading it so very much and can hardly wait till next year for the next book in this trilogy!  A must read  for all hopeless romantics and for those who like a good story. Keep writing Ms. Day...you have an audience  out here!!

B000B5OD4I|2.0|After researching this watch extensively I was initially happy with the price I found on Amazon and the fast shipping.  Unforturnately, after wearing the watch for a week I have discovered a couple of things that have greatly diminished my enjoyment of it.<br /><br />The first disappointment I found was that the hour hand is off about half a tick at whole hours.  Minor perhaps, but I've had far cheaper watches that were right on.  I couldn't believe my eyes that I was seeing this in a Seiko!<br /><br />Disappointment number two is that the power reserve of the watch is supposed to be 40+ hours and I find it stops if I don't wear it most of the day, every day.  Given that it can't be wound manually this is irritating.<br /><br />These two signigicant defects make me wonder if it's even a genuine Seiko.<br /><br />Of course, I had to resize the bracelet to actually wear the watch and discover the defects so now I can't return it.  My experience with warranty work on things like this is that it may come back even worse.<br /><br />I wish I'd bought locally from a reputable jeweler.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I cut my musical teeth on Gilbert & Sullivan. Gilbert was not merely /a/ master, but /the/ master of impossibly clever, yet effortless, lyrics. Howard Ashman came close. * How can you not love a song in which \\"Shanga-lang\\" rhymes with \\"Sturm and Drang\\"? Or the blunt sadism of \\"(Be a) Dentist\\", which is so much fun to sing? And Alan Menken is a master of the musical pastiche, his tunes perfectly catching the character of multiple 1950's styles, from tango to doo-wop.<br /><br />The movie comes close to perfection, though it could have been a bit livelier and faster-paced. (I suspect Frank Oz was trying to emphasize character, rather than humor.) Ellen Greene (who played Audrey on the stage) is a pip, her delivery a perfect mix of Mae Questel and Judy Holliday. The original ending is morbid to the point of tastelessness -- it's no wonder preview audiences hated it. (Is that Dick Miller on the fire escape?)<br /><br />The regular stereo sound, over a pair of good-but-not-great speakers is good-but-not-great. You need a first-rate surround system to hear everything in the mix.<br /><br />Recommended without reservation.<br /><br />PS: I wonder if the producers considered asking Laurence Olivier if he would cut a single of \\"(Be a) Dentist\\"?<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />What the heck is an \\"ironing machine\\"?<br /><br />In \\"Somewhere That's Green\\", Audrey longs for \\"a washer and a dryer and an ironing machine\\", the most-obscure cultural reference in \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\". The best way to think of an ironing machine is a huge typewriter where the clothing is the \\"paper\\". The \\"roller\\" pulls the item to be ironed through the machine, and the heated \\"platen\\" is pressed against the item to iron it. It's almost automatic -- you just press the foot and knee controls to move the clothing and activate the platen.<br /><br />My dad worked for GE and bought my mother an ironing machine. Despite the fact that the machine did most of the work (and more quickly than by hand), and you sat at the machine (rather than standing at an ironing board), my mother refused to use it. I don't know why.<br /><br />If you're interested, Google \\"ge ironing machine\\" (no quotes), and go to the \\"other mechanical ironers\\" page.<br /><br />* A girlfriend and I used to write song parodies. She told me Howard Ashman attended her high school, a sophomore when we were seniors.

B003IWYIGE|5.0|This is an outstanding story better than the movie Slum dog millionaire. it is narrated superbly. A great joy to listen to!
1469984202|4.0|As I understand it this work was originally released in 5 parts, and then combined into this finished omnibus as a complete novel. The joins are seamless; end to end it reads like a finished work.<br /><br />There is very strong characterization at work here, and some surprising twists, which is delightful to me as I can usually call these a mile away. The silo where these people live is a character unto itself, perpetuating a society and way of life unquestioned for generations. It begs the question, how did it come to be? These and many other questions are answered over the course of some interesting turns, with wonderful themes emerging on society, revolution, government and control along the way.<br /><br />If I have any reservations it would be the pacing of the 5th novella. Simply put, its too long and could have been edited down to be more terse and tension filled. After the fireworks of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th novellas which are just superb, the more drawn out narrative of the 5th seemed to unnecessarily diminish narrative push.<br /><br />Overall, top marks. This series is a great find, and I look forward to more from the author in the future!
030759565X|5.0|My partner and I been following the Smitten Kitchen blog for a few years, and all of her recipes have been superb. My partner presented me with the cookbook a few days ago, and it's packed with great recipes. I have made the eggplant and ricotta calzone, and it was delicious! The book is gorgeous, and the recipes are laid out in an easy-to-follow format. There is very little overlap with the blog, but thank goodness she included the rice krispy treats with browned butter! We are going to cook our way through this entire book. I also love the stories before each recipe; food is pretty central to my life, so I enjoy hearing her tale of how she came to each recipe. I've never sat around and read a cookbook before, but this one I did. I have also ordered it for a Christmas gift for a young cook--it will be just the thing to stretch his skills. I think it's a good book for beginners who want to cook real food, as Ms. Perelman has tested these recipes a lot, and the ingredients are readily available. However, there are also many things we experienced cooks found inspiring. My honey is making the butternut squash and carmelized onion galette and broccoli slaw for me on Friday!

0060873175|2.0|(Mild spoilers ahead)<br /><br />It kept my attention on my flight home from vacation, but the inconsistencies, plot holes, and cookie-cutter characters made for just a so-so read overall. My disbelief was having trouble staying afloat. For example, the micro-humans' size didn't seem to interact consistently with the surrounding world. In one sequence a snake is hunting one down and the book details the effects of the venom, but in other sections their size is implied to be so small the snake piece seems entirely implausible. Why wouldn't the antagonist simply kill them instead of the death by Rube Goldberg machine trope? Why did the antagonist shrink the lab worker too, aside from the obvious plot device of teaching the others about the micro world, and re-enforce the \\"but Mr Antagonist would *never* do this!\\" device of the seemingly good guy with a sinister core.<br /><br />Blech. The more I think and write about it, the more I dislike it. Just far too contrived. I'll stop now before it ends up with a 1-star.

B008OOYALE|3.0|While the dragons are cute, the first dozen levels have been painfully slow.  It is frustrating that the only way to make it not be mind numbing is to spend real money, which I won't do.  Also, the constant pop-ups to leave a review or check out their dragons that would require too much gold to not spend real money are more than slightly annoying. I shouldn't have to exit out of three boxes minimum before being able to play the game.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A charming book that describes the life of a simple farmer. Jaime was tortured during his early years in an orphanage which affects his life in the present.  Jaime is a very sympathetic character who is trying to recover from the death of his beloved uncle and make a better life for himself. It is a book of both sadness and of hope.  Suspensful at the end, it leaves you rooting for Jaime's life.
B000002MG1|5.0|This album helped me through a very tough time in my life, when I was 12 or 13 , I went to a summer camp, where I was unfortunate enough to endure horrendous bullying & peer pressure  at the hands of my fellow campers and I struggled to fit in with them or anybody else . I was extremely depressed, I was feeling hopeless & I was having suicidal thoughts. My brother sent me this album on a cassette tape that he put into a care package that my mother had sent me and it was the ONLY thing that helped me cope with my pre-teen angst , The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight was my anthem for that summer, so thank you R.E.M. your beautiful music has helped me through some of the darkest times of my entire life.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have this book on my kindle.  I waited until I was on vacation, so that I could read it without interruption.  This story unfolds with a background of the author's life and training that lead up to the event.  It is told simply and honestly.  My hope is that these brave men who risked everything are never revealed to the public.  God bless all of them for their service to our Country.  It is a shame they have an embarrassment for a commander and chief.  God save America.<br /><br />CDC<br />Duanesburgh, NY

B003CRM6QO|5.0|I love this movie now more than I did when I was a kid. When I was 10 or so a lot of the humour (\\"necrophilia\\"??) went over my head, and I didn't get \\"camp.\\" Well, now it makes it all so much better! Great music, great cast, great colourful visuals. Couldn't be better!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|If you enjoy dystopian fiction, and I do, this will be one of your favorites.  I have adored the recent YA sagas sweeping the nation as much as anyone, but as someone who hasn't actually been a teenager/YA for a very long time, it was refreshing to read about adults.  We have questions and longings and struggles too,after all.  I loved the gradual unfolding of the plot, the complexity of the characters ( even the villains believe they are acting for the greater good ), and the never-gets-old-at least-for-me themes of individuality in the face of mandated conformity, good intentions gone horribly awry, and of course, star-crossed love. This book makes me wish I was still teaching, so I could at least make my 130 students read it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books it had your heat and mind racing a mile a minute it was a page turner I bought it on a friday and I did not sleep for 2 days reading this book.<br />I feel in love with Christian and Ana and god was he fifty shades of personality, their friends family and staff were also great in the book.<br /><br />My one complaint is after enjoying this book and I mean enjoying I felt like someone had thrown COLD WATER ON ME the last chapter was NOT Christian and Ana it felt rushed to tie up in a neat bundle to be hurried to get to the printer and it made no sense.<br /><br />I would read Christian's version if one was ever written as for a movie I don't know who out thier can play him, my screen test would be Christian in Ana's apartment with Lealia and Christian the Submissive at Ana's feet.<br /><br />I still read through because I just love the dam book
B007SGLZP8|3.0|One thing you can count on in a John Grisham novel: a smooth read. This must be a combination of Grisham's language skills and editors/proofreaders who take their jobs seriously.<br /><br />I recall that as I started reading this book just several hours after it was released on October 23, I soon wished that I could finish it in \\"one sitting;\\" it was that fascinating. Other commitments precluded that. As the days passed, I grew less enthralled with the whole thing, and it ended up taking a couple of weeks to finish. This was because at about the twenty-five percent mark Grisham leads the reader into an (excessively) detailed description of a complex and unbelievable scam.<br /><br />It's the story of Malcolm Bannister, a black lawyer who works for a small Virginia firm. He is neither rich nor famous. Along comes a client involved in diverse corrupt schemes, including money laundering. He hires Bannister and pays exorbitant fees. It seems Bannister is mainly guilty of not asking questions when red flags pop up. A federal investigation leads to an indictment that names Bannister, basically a case of the feds casting a wide net, hoping to catch a lot of fish. Bannister ends up getting ten years, whereas the truly corrupt man at the center of the whole affair gets twelve.<br /><br />While in prison, craving revenge, Bannisters cooks up the aforementioned scam with a fellow inmate. There are just too many details about how the scam went down. I don't want to spoil it by saying much more, but the yarn did keep me engaged to the end.  Bannister narrates and tries to project himself as a basically good man who was burned by the system. He also sees himself as a clever man who can outwit the law. But, in the end, he's just a greedy dude who wants that pot of gold.<br /><br />It's a rock-solid three.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works as intended. No strain on the my tab's processor and always there when I need it (which is often).
B008458O3S|4.0|I must say I was a little surprised at all of the 5-star reviews over this game. Trainyard is not a bad game by any means but all of this hype may raise your expectations a little too high. Trainyard is a puzzle game and a slow paced game at that. This is not a game that requires fast reflexes so it is accessible for most skill levels. I had no problems playing this on my Kindle Fire and the touch controls worked most of the time. When they didn't work I was able to repeat my move and it worked the second time. This won't set you back because as I noted, you don't need twitch reflexes for this game.<br /><br />In Trainyard you literally just draw traintracks so that your trains go to stations of a matching color. Then you push a button and watch the little trains travel along your paths. If everything works out you earn stars which unlock subsequent levels. That's it. The challenge comes from drawing multiple tracks around obstacles and timing the trains so that they go to the correct station. For example, an orange train and a purple train may share a section of track so you design the track so that it switches and leads both trains to the correct station.<br /><br />There is a color-blind mode which is nice. Trainyard also has achievements with Amazon Gamecircle if that matters to you. I just find Trainyard to be a little too slow for my tastes. If you're looking for a more cerebral challenge or know someone who has difficulty with fast paced games then this would be a good pick up. I was tempted to give Trainyard 3 stars but I am leaving 4 stars because there isn't anything wrong with the game and it accomplishes what the developers wanted to do. It's just not my ideal game.
0307887448|1.0|I couldn't go past the first chapter and neither will you. Regardless of how nerdy you might be, you won't like it either.  I much rather read a phone book at least the characters are real in it. Kudos to the writer who somehow managed to hack Amazon by spamming it with the largest amount of fake 5 star reviews I have ever seen, now, that is what I call an great accomplishment, the book is not.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case is exactly what the description said it is.  Great price too.  Very pleased with it - color is great also!
0316228532|4.0|I must be one of the few people on the planet who has not read any of the Harry Potter books.  That said, I also have never been to the city of New York.  The characters seemed to real as well as their interactions with each other.  I loved Samantha's Mrs. Robinson routine.  It's what every teenage boy and young man dreams of.  By the end of the book I felt I had lived in the town.  J.K made it seem so real.  As a budding writer, I wrote my former teachers about the book, (I have never done this before) and said they should use excerpts from the book to freshen up their material for the classes they teach.  While some reviewer complained about it being a sad story, I say much of life is sad.  J.K. Rowling just did a fantastic job of painting it with words.  Hopefully I have the chance to meet her someday.
B004I744AS|5.0|As a linguist and former translator and teacher, I access this daily to get my word 'fix' and try to get 100.  That is a good day.  I've also learned a lot, and also use just the dictionary, although I've found words may not be there.  It is not 'unabridged'.  Still, it will get a '5'.
0345803485|2.0|Another reviewer mentioned that you either love or hate the book.  I fall in the latter catagory.  First off, the Christian Grey character does not or should not exist.  Second this book is perfect for women who want to fantasize what sex should be like.  It must be a one hander for many.  It took me a month to get beyond page 50.  I am past the halfway mark and will push through.  At this point I have no desire to read the rest of the Trilogy.  This is one of the few books I have read, where I keep a garbage can next to me for the times I retch
174179403X|4.0|The book is more than adequate as a guide to the region, if not quite as thorough as it might be. But it covers three very different countries in a fairly remote part of the world, so that's to be expected. I found no other concise travel guides out there for the Caucasus. I tried to follow one of the walking tours described in the book, and that proved challenging, though eventually I was able to find the landmarks they mentioned. Again, overall it does the job more than adequately.
B002361MLA|5.0|I read this book on my Kindle from the free lending library and as soon as I finished it, I bought a copy, because I felt this was a book I want to be able to reread. I even considered buying a hard copy of it in case of future power failures where a Kindle will be useless. If you at all a seeker of spiritual living, consider this book as a reference and how it could work in real life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's so addictive and fun. I couldn't stop playing it when, I first got the app. It's the best app I have on my phone.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite writers. I have read all of his books and \\"The Panther' is one of his best.<br /><br />Anti-terrorits Task Force agent John Corey and his wife, Kate, who is a FBI agent, are sent to Yemen to apprehend/ kill the terrorist by the name of The Panther. The Panther is an American born nut case who is responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole. Is there more to this assignment than meets the eye? Twists and turns await our characters. It is one exciting ride to the very last page. Will John and Kate succeed or will The Panther out smart them in the end? No one can be trusted.<br /><br />John Corey has been the frequent star in Nelson DeMIlle books.  He is a special unique character, strong & intellegent with observations and one liners that are laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />The book is a page turner and I highly recommend it.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A definite read if you love a good mystery and quirky characters!! Does have a lot of techno-geek terms, but not to the point that you can't follow the story.  Definitely in my top 20 favorite books!! Highly recommend!!

B0085A9HXS|5.0|I suppose I've little more to offer than just one more opinion of this heavily-reviewed film.  If I bring anything to the table at all it's a life-long love of martial arts films.  But the ability to compare and contrast different movies within a genre is really only relevant if the film stays within the confines of that genre.  \\"The Raid\\" is quite a bit more ambitious than your usual fight-flick but so is something like \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\". Yet other than people getting kicked in the face the two films share very little in the way of similarities.  Where \\"CT, HD\\" attempts a traditional kung fu film with an epic scope and large cast, \\"The Raid\\" seems to attempt to make a full-on modern martial arts film that transcends that particular action category and into a few others in order to attract a more diverse audience while still giving regular fans more to be excited about than usual.  While director Gareth Evans and his crew were certainly successful in those two aspects, I don't feel the transcendence was complete.  By the time all's said and done, this really ends up being just a martial arts film.  But a really, really good one!<br /><br />\\"The Raid\\" tells the story of young officer Rama (Iko Uwais, soon to appear in the Keanu Reeves-directed \\"Man of Tai Chi\\"), who leaves his cozy apartment and pregnant wife to enter a multi-story tenement run by gangster Tama (terrific Indonesian veteran actor Ray Sahetapy).  This building houses the kind of inhabitants who are more than willing to kill a cop in exchange for free rent or at least the waving of their security deposit.  This mission is lead by the crooked Lt. Wahyu (Pierre Gruno), who isn't too worried about Rama's inexperienced S.W.A.T. team accompanying him cuz they know nothing about his agenda and he's got the element of surprise on Tama.  Or does he?<br /><br />Welsh director Evans previously helmed \\"Merantau\\", a more intentionally traditional fight-flick that displayed the Indonesian martial art of Silat in a modern setting.  Here he reunites with the likable and very capable Iko Uwais and choreographer Yayan Ruhian (who plays Tama's awesome main henchman, Mad Dog).  While I enjoyed the increasingly complex action in \\"Merantau\\" quite a bit, the intensity of the action from that film is amped-up here BIG TIME without sacrificing the filming techniques that fight-flick fans like myself feel should be utilized in all action films.  Ya know, the good ones where the wires are minimal, actors provide their own stunts, the choreography's fast and complex, cameramen keep their distance from performers, and the editing's smooth?  Yeah, baby, that's what I like and that's what \\"The Raid\\" delivers!  With good use of location and added brutality and gore!  Not for the kids and not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The Sony/Stage 6 DVD has spoken languages in both (Bahasa) Indonesian or dubbed into English.  Subtitles available in English (with or without SDH) and Spanish.  Special features are loaded with 7 featurettes on stunts, choreography, interviews and music stuff.<br /><br />If I were to register a complaint it would likely involve the \\"Redemption\\" part of the title, added to the American release.  Probably the most overused word to appear on DVD boxes EVER and one whose very definition brings its use here heavily into question.  It's appearance obscures the film's title rather than enhancing it.  Oh, well.  I assume there'll be several more movies over the next several years to haphazardly throw some redemption into the title or description.  Coincidentally, this is the most enjoyable martial arts film I've seen since 2010's \\"Undisputed III: Redemption\\"!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />2011.  aka: The Raidof Silat in a modern setting.

B005S0HNU2|5.0|Beware regions of disc, as they may not be compatible with your DVD player. Region 2 DVDs are European. Some American DVD players can play them, some cannot. Considering Merlin is produced in Europe and airs on BBC this is to be expected.<br /><br />Merlin's and Arthur's story continues. This season has many dark, but also many happy parts. As Merlin begins to mature he begins to be less naive and more  paranoid. His faith is Arthur as the one true king is strengthened, but as Merlin begins to gain confidence in himself he begins to make him misinterpret many things.<br /><br />This season was well done, but I felt at times a bit drier than previous seasons. Yet it all seemed to have purpose. More than a few times I began to wonder if Merlin would reveal himself soon as he became more heedless with his magic in public. During certain parts I was surprised by Merlin's general attitude and what seems like (but I am not quite sure if it is) deep anger that seems to be growing inside of him.<br /><br />If you've been following Merlin since season 1 you'll be interested in seeing the changes that have happened in season 4
B000MRA5NS|5.0|In my \\"Bond world\\", here's how I rank them:<br /><br />1). Goldfinger<br /><br />2). Casino Royale<br /><br />3). All the rest.<br /><br />I just watched \\"Casino Royale\\" again last night after having seeing \\"Skyfall.\\"<br /><br />CR just holds up. Five stars!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I've really enjoyed this album. The songs all have a similar sound but it's easy to listen to. The use of the auto-tune is a bit different and gives it an interesting sound.
B001FAFO3W|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid & still think it's great! Fun story & soundtrack -- appropriate for everyone. It is nice to have it on DVD
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I've been working my way through the first four books of this series and I love them! Although it's a bit dense at times I absolutely love the story being told and I'm incredibly attached to the characters.<br /><br />I have to say that I have had some issues with this as an e-book. It didn't impact my ratings because the issue is minor but still annoying. After page 694 my version stopped counting pages so after literally thousands of pages of reading it still says I'm on page 694 of 694. It's obnoxious for such a long book (All four books are presented as one really long book in the kindle version. There are markers to signify the breaks between books but they're all together in one document). But it hasn't impacted my enjoyment of the story, it just makes it harder to keep track of my progress.
B002RKSXJG|5.0|Being the cheap person that I can sometimes be I got this book on a whim because it was free.  Every time that I thought I had it figured out . . . I didn't.  It started out slow but managed to grab my attention as I read on.  If you like a good mystery this is definitely the one to read.
B007NQLK3K|4.0|If you have already purchased a revoltech figure then you know the quality of the figures they produce. If not, the easiest way to explain it is that they are top notch.<br /><br />This figure has 28 points of articulation throughout its body, interchangeable head, hands and cannon. Excellent paint job and sculpt, and worth every penny. Like I said, it is super articulated, however due to the sculpts of the armor, movement is SLIGHTLY restricted in some places (such as hip and elbows depending on the angle) but this is by no means a major issue.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You know once in a while traveling through amazon looking for books to download for your kindle you come across something very unexpected. I have heard of Wool on amazon and also read an article about it in a magazine but it did'nt seem to catch my attention. Never heard of Hugh Howey so i thought can this book realy be worth the attention it was getting. As i've learned being a kindle owner you can find some interesting authors that are relative unknowns and find they are just as good as any best selling author. To make a long story short i decided to give Wool a try. Wow!!! this book was absolutley fantastic. How this man is not as well known as some of the more recent bestselling authors i don't know. the story and the characters come to life on the first page. When Holston went to cleaning i was riveted and could'nt put the book down through the next four stories. You can call this sci-fi or dystopian fiction but really it's a fable. The life of these characters,the way they live and the trials that are put in front of them could not have been more exciting,scary and poignant. I will not put this book in any genre it is just simply great writing from a fresh and imaginative author. This book is recommended to those who love to get lost in a book. Howey ,while i know he's written other books is more well known to Amazon readers but not for long. This was simply awesome,on to the next book.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The parcel mail came at an excellence condition.  It is really impressive, exciting, and lot of fruitful knowledge about nature that we have not learnt and seen before.  My family all love it and we will carry on buying more articles like this for our collection.
B005LAIIDU|5.0|Wreck-It-Ralph is the third straight film from Disney that has the goodwill forming a new Disney animated era following Tangled and Winnie the Pooh. This film is about Ralph a bad guy in a video game, Fix It Felix going game jumping as going turbo as they called it into Hero's Duty and Sugar Rush where he encounters new friends that he wants to be a good guy to get a medal for being a hero can led to many consequences that led to something powerful and bad things can happen. Can Ralph get a hero's medal and save not only his game and his friends(spoiler alert: but the whole video game world from an enemy that wants to take over other games?)<br /><br />I had enjoyed this movie so much with many video game character cameos and references from Sonic, Dr. Robonik, Bowser, Bison, Zangef, Kano, Ken, Pac-man and the ghost, Q-Bert and many more game characters only for people to see that its more for the hardcore gamer than for kids that they wouldn't get the game references but still a great time. This is the best animated film of 2012! This should had won the Best Animated Film Oscar instead of Brave!
0785163174|5.0|This is your typical marvel hardcover...oversized, built to last and packed with extras.<br />the biggest extra of this book is the free download code of the digital version.  once downloaded to your marvel.com account you can view it on your pc, mac, android, iphone, tablet...whatever.  very, very cool.  (though it supposedly expires or some b.s.?!?)<br />Anyway, the story is as follows.  The Avengers go to the X-Men's base and politely demand permission to arrest one of the x-chicks.  Cyclops attacks and all hell breaks loose.  A war is fought between the X-Men and Avengers.  Suddenly the Phoenix force shows up on Earth and that just tips the scales in an unimaginable way.  The ending was lacking but issue 9-11 are worth the price of admission alone.  And this is a Marvel comic...there is no ending...the story continues in Uncanny Avengers # 1.  But Marvel really dropped the ball with issue 12.  The quality of art from issue 11 to issue 12 is staggering.  12 really felt like it was slapped together in ten minutes...but the whole package is incredible.<br />What happens in this series is important to the Marvel Universe.  It gives characters purpose that never previously had one.  This one story sends ripples through the entire planet and I don't think anybody will be left unaffected.<br />And you can get it for considerably less than retail with free shipping...what's to debate!?  It's what: 19+ issues for $45?  $2.50 an issue?  For me I have no problem with that.  Throw in the free digital copies (which you could hand over to someone that doesn't normally read comics if you wanted) and I don't understand why there would be any question.  To buy these issues separately would have cost you $72 retail...it's quite a deal and belongs in your Marvel collection right next to Avengers Disassembled, Civil War, Secret Invasion, Dark Reign, etc.<br />Hats off to all involved...and do yourself a favor: read every single issue of Uncanny X-Force...absolutely amazing!!!
B005LAII7G|5.0|This film was amazing and closer to the Judge Dredd comics that its cue in the film is taken from The Raid: Redemption also an underseen film from this year, this is one of the best science fiction films of the year despite being a major box office disapointment with better reviews and close to the gritty comicbooks transport into a gritty world of corruption with Dredd and Anderson taking on gangs with lots of blood and guts and fast paced action that kept this film going from beginning to end, it will be a cult classic for many years to come!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|it gets realy hard really fast. by level ten i couldnt play anymore it was so hard. good concept though.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|omg it is very cool! hard to put down.<br />creative&hellip; graffics are great. try it you will want more. you can zoom in on the picture find puzzle which is helpful.
B005LAII94|4.0|\\"Just because I'm telling you this story doesn't mean I'm alive at the end of it.\\" Ben (Taylor-Johnson) and Chon (Kitsch) are the best pot growers in the world. They have clients from everywhere and are respected. The woman in their lives is O (Lively) and the three of them of a perfect life. When a Mexican Cartel has the idea of joining with them they are surprised when Ben and Chon don't give them the answer they want. The cartel is upset and when they kidnap O Ben and Chon have to do whatever the cartel says to get her back, but everyone has a breaking point. I was really looking forward to this movie. I am a huge Oliver Stone fan and this looked like a throwback to his gritty, \\"Natural Born Killers\\" style movies. I have to say I was not disappointed. The movie was tense almost the entire time and had you guessing who was playing who. Selma Hayak was a strange choice to play a cartel leader but after watching this she was a great fit. I will say though that Del Toro was amazing in this I wouldn't be surprised to see him get an Oscar nomination for this, he was so evil in this that he made the movie. If you are a fan of Stone then you will love this like I did. The only complaint I had was that I'm not quite sure I liked the end. You will have to watch and see for yourself. I do recommend this though. Overall, a great movie with an ending I'm not sure I liked or not. I give it an A-.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Wish E.L. James would write more Fifty Shades. Or similar books.<br />At first I really thought I wasn't going to enjoy the book as it is about stuff I neever thought of before. But after reading the first few chapters of the first one I loved it and couldn't put the book down.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|I was told about The Walking Dead a few weeks ago (yes, I tend to get a little behind regarding television lol) and I watched season one and two within about a week and a half. I LOVE IT! I started watching season three on Amazon. This way is muchless expensive and I look forward to it! The Walking Dead is definitely a must see thus far!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The movie was not only good but funny. We watched it as a family and really enjoyed. My son loved the fact it had action in it with his favorite Hero's.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have become a little obsessed with this game!  I still haven't learned how to keep it on landscape to play.  It keeps switching views when I move...
B003GK21U8|4.0|When I first started reading I wasn't sure if it was my kind of book, I soon found out I was wrong and could no stop reading I ended up really enjoying it I will certainly read more Ken Follett books.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|awsome!!!! I could barely put it down and enjoyed reading it so much. A must read and more than once
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Really thought they could have done more with the big humanoid guy and the story...disappointing...<br />Guess there is no improving on the chilling, suspenseful, action packed first Alien with Ms. Weaver the Magnificant.  Still the scariest movie I've ever seen.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm seriously hooked on this game! no glitches and no problems. runs great on the kindle fire! absolutely love it!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|great app. large easy to use!  I keep it next to me all of the time. it has replaced anything else that I use.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|lots of fun!  meet lots of nice people!  entertaining for hours! lets you explore your creative side! makes getting up fun!
0439023513|3.0|I am not much of a reader....it takes a LOT to hold my interest.  So, I was and am completely shocked that I read the entire trilogy in three weeks.<br /><br />The first was definitely my favorite.  The second book picked up right from where the first left off...taking readers on another Hunger Games journey.<br /><br />And now Mockingjay.  This one picks up right away, as if the 2nd and 3rd book should be consolodated.<br /><br />Mockingjay takes the reader for a journey of heroism, pride, strength, honor, and fear.  As soon as the reader thinks they've figured out the direction this will go, they are thrown a bunch of pods (inside reference) and taken off path.<br /><br />By the end, readers are left in a whirlwind that happens in less than 20 pages.  Seriously.  I LOVED this book, but I got the feeling that Suzanne Collins got about halfway through writing it, when a wave of fatigue hit.  Like, she wanted just to be done with it.<br /><br />The book wraps up sooooooooooooooo many concepts in a matter of words, as if the writer is rushing just to finish it.  There are characters left towards the end that are only mentioned in there wherabouts once, and that's it.  Characters that have been with readers the entire run of the trilogy are very easily dismissed.<br /><br />The last third of the book(while good) didn't match in tone to the rest of the suspensful series.  Instead, it felt extremely pressured and rushed, and wrapped up relationships and entertwining stories in a way that seemed somehow disrescpectful to the nail-biting extent of the other books.<br /><br />So, all in all.....I'd say this one was alright.  It definitely took my breath away in parts, left me unable to put it down.  But, I was dissapointed in how the author concluded everything. Kind of like a kid sweeping everything under his bed so he can call it \\"clean\\".<br /><br />There was an end, it was a good one..........it was just zipped through, unlike the rest of the series.  Which was dissapointing.<br /><br />But, HG fans will like this, and appreciate the resolution.<br /><br />Enjoy!ting.<br /><br />But, HG fans will like this, and appreciate the resolution.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I so enjoyed this book and the rest in the series. I always read books that I intend to give to my grandchildren and this one was a winner. I love the lessons that it will teach them. All around good read.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This TREMENDOUS video is sweet, very humorous, powerful and should be seen and heeded by every parent in America.The message is for all parents to STAND UP for what is good and right and true.  The story is given in a highly engaging manner - the movie captures and holds the viewer's attention throughout.  Do not miss seeing &#34;Courageous&#34;.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I can't give this game a 5 star rating because I think it misleads you. Sure the game is free but there will come a time you have to pay to keep on playing. I also don't. recall that being mentioned. then too experience tells me the additional purchases required will not be cheap.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am so thrilled with Angry Birds Star Wars. Wars are challenging enough to keep me interested (and sometimes frustrated), the Angry Birds are a sight to see especially the Chewbaca bird (love his sound so much), and did I mention the pigs?  Darth Vader pig blows me away, no pun intended!  I didn't find $2.99 a bother.  I am challenged, I laugh at some of the birds (programming is awesome), and I believe Rovio has topped all of the other Angry Bird games. Spend the $2.99 and have the fun of your life \\"in a galaxy far, far away!
B008Y1YJZY|1.0|I just bought a brand new Samsung 3D TV and Samsung Blueray 3D DVD Player. My first 3D movie was going to be this one. 2 New TV's Later and the second New 3D Blue Ray player and 2 New Arthur Christmas 3D Discs we have determined this is NOT A WORKING 3D DISC. I am sure in about a Week a TON of these movies will be coming BACK!!! It's unfortunate I went through a nightmare 4 days with buying a New TV returning and getting another and going through 2 New Blue ray, Oh and an updated Monster 1000 HDMI cable as Thought the Disc I bought from Target could not be Defective!! I want to see the movie, which note it will play in 2d but not the reason I purchased. Just unfortunate this was the first 3D movie I Bought!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very seldom do I read a book that I just can not put down. This is one of those books!!<br /><br />I admit that I watched the movie first, then I got around to reading this trilogy on my kindle. Once I started turning the pages,<br />it was very difficult to put it down. I either got distracted by something else needing my attention, or my eyes will not stay open any longer! I breezed through this book in just under a week, and I am normally a very slow reader. (Taking roughly a month or more to read a similar sized book.)<br />Once I finished the book, I waited two days before starting on the second book. In the first two or three days I read almost half the book (at work). When I got home, I stayed up until the book was done....10 and half hours later!!!<br /><br />I have just started the last book. Each one is riveting!
B00992CF6W|2.0|I enjoy playing minecraft on my xbox 360,but there is no free version for minecraft pocket edition.if there was a free version, I would give this 5stars
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very good book.  I think anyone would enjoy this as it is a surprise.  John Grisham is a good author.
B00454U1O2|5.0|This is great from start to finish. Song choice Is way cool and the recordings are digital.  A plus. 200%.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Does every thing; totally recommend it. Would be 5 stars, but not a great 'how to ', but you can figure it out easily enough.
B005K17RU0|4.0|it works good, has ads but not overt or bothersome. has nice features, map is a little slow. nice graphics
1907590331|5.0|This is a classic tale of two brothers and a decision to be made that will change their lives completely. Full of symbolism, situation ethics, social commentary, etc.. Easy read for a teen to an adult and definitely a book for discussion. I liked it when I read it, and it is emotionally moving. Even if you don't like the story line, Steinbeck's writing is such that one can appreciate all the issues addressed as well as some really good writing.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|Makes playing piano melodies fun, nice selection of classical pieces. different modes of play, nice graphics and sound. Well designed music game.
0307742997|3.0|I found this a very good quality crime thriller but some clumsy translation let it down and detracted from the enjoyment of the read
B00961ZGQC|5.0|Who doesn't love this song? Can't get it out of my head. I love all the videos people are doing to the music. Too fun!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Loved the twists and turns, the characters.  Can't wait to see this as a movie.
B006UKC566|5.0|I can't give this film enough praise. It was filmed beautifully. Every scene was a work of art. The characters were fresh and original. The film maintained intensity through the whole length. It had a full three acts. It never wavered in what it set out to accomplish. The Gods were totally unique and amazing. The battles were bloody and brutal. The music was perfect, never too much or too little. The casting was right on. And of course the story was solid.<br />This is the best Greek God battle film I have ever seen.<br />How this one slipped through the cracks I will never know.<br />It is way, way better than \\"Clash of the Titans\\" and \\"Wrath of the Titans\\" combined.<br />It was what the \\"300\\" aspired to be.<br />A perfect film.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This is a great book for young readers.  Grisham has done a very nice job of teaching basic legal concepts and deductive reasoning in a plot that speaks to middle school aged children.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I read this book because it came highly recommended from several Slate journalists, and as a policy wonk who tends to immerse myself and my \\"pleasure\\" reading in domestic topics and concerns, I thought this would be an artful way to learn about life in North Korea.  Indeed, the novel depicts North Korea in detail and through characters in a way that makes you want to take back any other time you used the word \\"bleak,\\" as those prior uses now seem melodramatic. The novel's topic was especially powerful to read as our 2012 elections in the U.S. unfolded, and I have to give credit to the author for going back and forth in time in a creative way.  But beyond these quasi-compliments, I give The Orphan-Master's Son a low rating because it was a near-total slog to read.  About a third of the way in, I would have given it up if not for my sheer stubbornness.  I know very, very, very well that the book is 443 pages long because damn if I didn't check my Kindle progress every 5 minutes.  I know that I am in the minority in giving this book a low rating, but I wanted to speak up as a minority voice to share my criticisms. For example, I don't think it was necessary for the first half (about the main character's youth) to be as long as it was, and I have to believe that historical fiction of an oppressive, maniacal dictator and a country swathed in propaganda can be written in a way that is itself less oppressive to read.  Some of the creative voice in this book - especially in the second part - is done by retelling periods of time out of order and from the perspective of different narrators, and I found this strategy to add to the book's density both because it was confusing and because you kept taking steps forward and then back.  I've read plenty of artful narratives to which I did not constantly ask, \\"Will this book never end?\\"  I don't intend to disrespect Adam Johnson's talents or the oppression under which North Koreans live every day, but if you - like me - treasure your free time and the reading you choose during it, I personally advise against this choice and hope that you will weigh this review along with the raves.
B004G600A4|5.0|I bought this for my 4-year-old and everyone loves it (ok, especially, the 4-year-old).  An excellent cartoon (wish there were more like it)!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|No issue with the seller.  However, the case is absolute junk.  Performed test and had water droplets inside afterwards and people on the other end couldn't hear me due to extreme muffling.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|The look is spot-on and the sounds are decent, so it's perfect for cosplay, which is probably what 9/10 people want it for. I definitely recommend it, but feel I should point out the following minor flaws that keep it from being worth the price:<br /><br />It's really sturdy when collapsed, but the head jiggles around very loosely when you extend it unless keep your thumb firmly on the slider.<br /><br />The pen attachments come off really easily. I didn't plan on using the UV pen anyway, so I just stuck the regular pen on with a bit of hot glue and now it stays perfectly fine.<br /><br />The cover on the slider also doesn't stay on very well either. You can't glue it on, though because the screw underneath is how you open the battery compartment. Honestly, you can just leave it off altogether and it won't look all that different. (Personally, I think it actually looks better with a smaller slider, but that's just me.)<br /><br />$5 cheaper and it would be totally worth it, but I wouldn't say it's TOO much of a ripoff as it is.
B007THA4FI|1.0|My reading time is precious and this was a waste. I slogged thru but found little, if any, enjoyment. Perhaps I'm not \\"intelligent\\" enough to enjoy page after page of petty small town politics carried on by petty small town people. The large cast of characters was real enough - we all know & hate people like the pathetic sods in this book. Apparently the snobby town of Pagsford doesn't have a single decent human being within its boundaries, because I couldn't give a jot about any of them. Cry? Nope...crying requires caring and I just didn't.  The ending was an \\"are you kidding me\\" moment - I read thru all of this for THAT? I also failed to see ANY humor - I guess I am just not amused by bullying, self-mutilation, drugs, rape, adultery, child abuse, etc.  A huge disappointment from a favorite author. I'll be getting any future books from the library.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I've seen several 5 star, raving reviews of this book here on Amazon, so when a friend of mine loaned it to me, I was quite interested to dig in and find out what people loved about it. Sadly, after the initial short-story that starts the book off, the story and characters just drag.<br /><br />On its own, the short story \\"Wool\\" is a good one - fast-paced and tightly written. The characters seemed a bit one-note to me, but because the premise was so interesting (people forced to live underground and being put to death for crimes by being sent into the toxic environment outside) I kept reading to see where the ideas and the story would go. Once I got past that short story and into the rest of the omnibus, the tight and fast-paced writing that had pushed the story along suddenly seemed to vanish. The story slogged on and on, and the one-note characters became a lot less tolerable. It just seemed as though there was nothing else for the author to say of importance to the story and just stretched it out for the sake of writing a much longer novel.<br /><br />Some stories have their best impact in the short form - \\"Wool\\" is one of those stories.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have always liked Playtrix games and was glad to see this come to the app store.  Hope to see more games from this developer.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|I initially said that: \\"this is a very good album and I think it's an improvement over Poetry for the Poisoned in that it's back to Kamelot's roots.  Karevik's vocals sound almost eerily identical to Khan's (!), and that's a good thing, because I think we all waited for the Kamelot-we-know's return\\".<br /><br />Now I have to revise my review: after listening to this album over the past few days, I can't stop listening to it and I think it's EXCELLENT!  I think it equals Ghost Opera (not sure it surpasses it yet :)  Karevik's voice does sound like Khan's but I think it's mellower and smoother, where it's not as deep, but with a wider range, and it definitely fits the music perfectly!  I can't stop listening to this album, it really IS gripping and you especially keep humming Joylee and the Confession...  SUPERB!<br /><br />I previously said that Kamelot is back to its roots.  I think Kamelot has outgrown its roots by far!  It showed that it can play differently with Poetry for the Poisoned (and it was a necessary phase in its musical development) but not everyone was ready (me included).  Now its post-Poetry music is just more mature but with a return to the more familiar notes and it has worked beautifully on Silverthorn!<br /><br />Bravo and thank you to the band and Karevik!
B0092C2X7U|4.0|fun game... backflips get repetitive tho, its more fun to just hurt urself and see all of the different clips u can unlock
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game like most of the Team Lava games I've played is so adorable and super addicting. Bakery Story is my number one pick though.
B008NABUU8|2.0|Seems like a fun game but the touch controls are so inaccurate and buggy, I can't keep myself playing due to the horrible frustration. I am using a Galaxy Nexus.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a classic game.  The free version is good except they keep advertising other games when you finish each level,  before they show you the score.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Batman Begins is a great action movie for adults, teens and older pre-teens. Although don't mistake Batman Begins to be like the kid friendly Spiderman Trilogy. Batman Begins is a lot more aggressive and harsh. It also has a much more detailed plot that could possibly confuse younger viewers. For parents who want to know what it has in terms of violence, it includes martial arts, a hallucinogenic drug that causes to a person who has been exposed to it to think everything is terrifying. People are shone drinking wine at a party, although nobody gets drunk. A few curse words including H*ll, D**n, and A**. A flash back to a scene where a mugger murders Batman's parents (Not bloody, just two gunshots).  No highly romantic material, just one very brief kiss. I know you're wondering if it's even worth watching. I assure you it is. It has lot of compelling fight scenes that have you at the tip of your seat wondering what will happen next. The plot is good and is the classic good vs. evil though detailed and not boring.  All together Batman Begins is a great movie full of conflict, action, adventure and a entertaining plot. I highly recommend it for adults, teens, and mature pre-teens.
B007V80WUC|5.0|I was skeptical since there have been so few good prog albums of late.  Yet CM does NOT disappoint!  The album is less proggy than their previous ones and a little on the poppy side, I'd say, but you get excellent music and musicianship nonetheless.  The beginning is very much like a couple of DT songs so you can't help but compare: I do think CM, as long as they keep playing the way they have, and do release albums more often than every 5 years (seriously...?), they are the next DT hands down.  And btw, the last song is really catchy... :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game! It kept me call through a hurricane and a snow/ nor- easter.<br />It definately helped me relax and I used my mind for strategy instead of worries.
032147404X|5.0|I bought this and part 4. I have gone back and ordered 2 & 3 as well. Each one has something not in the others. Although I am a published photographer in the 35mm film days, these books help shortcut the learning curve with the digital.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I have this game on many platforms and the Android version is very disappointing.  Although the basic game play is pretty much the same, you don't get the Zen Garden and other free-play features that gives the game replay value on other platforms (on which I would give it 5 stars).  This version has been out for some time now, I would have thought the authors would have added those features by now.
0316228532|3.0|This book would be a great read for those interested in psychology or sociology. Much material is presented that would be quintessential for a class paper or report.<br /><br />Happily, I can say I don't know families like the ones in this narrative. Or at least, I should say, I don't think I do.<br /><br />It seems the characters in this story don't try to cover up their behaviors because, to them, their conduct isn't out of the norm. I guess that's what the author, J.K. Rowling, is telling her audience.<br /><br />The various levels of economy present problems significant to each group. Rowling's writing makes us feel this. For example, the poor have problems with their basic needs being met. Not only is food in short supply, but drug use and a means of acquiring the drugs rob them of human dignity.<br /><br />Those who have more comfortable life styles have their set of problems too. The typical keeping up with friends and neighbors leads to dishonesty and conflict. Both material entities and everyday dealings with social life in the neighborhood and town are involved. Again, Rowling masterfully sees to it that we see it.<br /><br />Teenagers are a part of all these levels with their own problems, wants, needs, desires, etc.<br /><br />Much offensive language is used throughout the story. I didn't like reading that, but have to say it helped identify the way some live.<br /><br />I've decided it isn't the story I didn't like. It was the bare, base way it was presented, and the unscrupulous way some live.
1616960922|2.0|Sanderson is one of the more creative and experienced genre writers out there. This is why I experienced this book as a disappointing let down. We get a snapshot, a vignette, an after-thought that someone like Sanderson can spit out during a long weekend in Torrey. It is the minimum effort that I take an exception to, and the condescension to the reader that this implies. I was similarly disappointed after I read his take on the Infinity Blade, which leaves one feeling having been taken advantage of. For one, TES is much too short - it  feels like a chapter, or one of those 'to be continued' newspaper pieces. There are the usual Sanderson witticisms but little character development, analysis, no epic good vs bad or real vs unreal. This underwhelming non-ambitious short story was a let down. I was hoping for more.

B000EWBKK8|4.0|Judging from the reviews (and, say, from an endorsement by Amnesty International), most people consider this movie as a movie about arms trade, especially about private arms dealers. The main character, Yuri Orlov, is such a dealer, and the movie tells the story of his life so far, so this is indeed correct to some extent. Unfortunately, the deeper aspects of the movie are hardly appreciated.<br /><br />For me, this movie is about Yuri Orlov, brilliantly played by Nicolas Cage, and about the \\"complexity of human existence in the modern world\\" (Milan Kundera) resulting from the modern technology. The other movies directed by Andrew Niccol, the director of \\"Lord of War\\", are \\"Gattaca\\", \\"S1m0ne\\", and \\"In time\\" (all are also written by him). All of them are about the effects of future technology on human existence. They do not seriously overstep the borders of what is possible according to the modern science (in contrast with legions of others \\"sci\\"-fi movies). In Niccol's movies the more advanced future technology is only a tool for focusing attention on some things already in place.<br /><br />It is not surprising at all that in one of his movies Andrew Niccol deals with an existing technology. This technology, mostly the Soviet machine-gun AK-47, is about 60-65 years old. It was a real breakthrough, and if one takes into account the cost and the ease of use, it may still be the best. AK-47 is the main merchandise Yuri Orlov is trading; mostly because trading in AK-47 is the best from purely business point of view. He would trade in jet fighters or nuclear submarines, if governments wouldn't reserve this more profitable trade for themselves.<br /><br />Near the end of the movie (this is not a spoiler) Orlov's wife asks him why he is doing this. He answers \\"I'm good at it\\". Here is one of the main problems of human existence: when somebody discovers that she or he is very good at something, the desire to do this is overwhelming. One may find this something to be morally objectionable, leading to a very boring life, or whatever. The desire to do things you are good at usually wins. Yuri Orlov is going to great lengths to fight his own feeling that his business is morally objectionable. It is sad that not only he almost succeeds, but that his arguments are valid and accepted by the governments and the society (both in the movie and in the real world). By this reason he continues his business instead of being behind bars, and is doomed to be tormented by his guilt.<br /><br />He got into such a miserable situation not because of wars, mass killings, or genocide here or there. All of this existed during the whole history of humankind. He was put into his position by the AK-47 and by more modern technologies enabling global trading. If not these technologies, he would have a life miserable in a different sense of the word, a life with an unrequested talent.<br /><br />Some people dislike the movie much enough as to say that it was a waste of $5.00 because it is anti-American. It is most resolutely not. Just before the final credits it said that the most of the arms trading is done not by American arms dealers and even not by the American government (as some are inclined to think).<br /><br />You may watch \\"Lord of war\\" as a purely political movie (it is exceptionally good as such), but then you should be ready for a lot of objectionable things in it, no matter what your political position is. The movie gives no definite answers, and does not put the blame squarely on Orlov personally, USA as the universal villain, or dissolution of the USSR, for example - name your own favorite. But there are no such answers.<br /><br />I watched \\"Lord of War\\" as a movie about Yuri Orlov. This wasn't my intention. I watched it only because it was directed by Andrew Niccol. It just turned out this way. It is great as a movie about a person with strange gift (all real gifts are strange) in our complex world. The performance of Nicolas Cage is one of thebest in his career. He is way too often cast into a role of a cartoon character with high level of adrenalin (he is good at this, for sure). But \\"Lord of war\\" is one of the movies showing Nicolas Cage as a truly great actor (he is much better as Yuri Orlov than in his Oscar-winning performance in \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\").<br /><br />The script by Andrew Niccol is brilliant. He manages to explain a lot in a couple of phrases and a minute of screen time (watch the development of the relations of Orlov with his wife). Usually I hate the voiceover; this is the first movie in which I found the voiceover to be not objectionable at all.<br /><br />The movie contains some subtle references to other movies, which are hard to notice while watching it for the first time. The most important ones are to \\"Rumble fish\\" (Francis Ford Coppola, 1983), and to \\"Brazil\\" (Terry Gilliam, 1985). They indicate the proper context for this movie.<br /><br />May be there is one more important reference. The nemesis of Yuri Orlov, an idealistic Interpol agent, is named Jack Valentine (played by Ethan Hawke). And there is Jill Valentine, a character from \\"Resident Evil\\" videogames and movies. It is very hard to believe that there are people such as Jack Valentine who have so much power as he has. This character is needed for the movie by the well justified standards of screenwriting. It is hard to go without an interpersonal conflict, and without a \\"really good person\\" such as Jack Valentine. But he is from a videogame. Actually, Jack Valentine personifies Orlov's conscience.best in his career. He is way too often cast into a role of a cartoon character with high level of adrenalin (he is good at this, for sure).

0316228532|1.0|I hate to come on here and write a bad review of an author that I admire and respect so much.  J.K. Rowling is a brilliant writer who can create an intricate universe with just a few words.  However, this time her words obliterated my interest entirely.  I don't mind characters that are not all rainbows and puppies.  I'm a fan of Gillian Flynn and her characters are very dark.  However, they need to have at least one redeeming quality.  These characters, including the children, were horrible people that I didn't care about in the slightest.  Nor did I care about their whiny plight to be unified in their hatred and disgust of those less fortunate and less \\"perfect\\" than themselves.  There were so many charachters I could barely remember how they were connected to one another.  I only finished this book out of respect for the author and on sheer hope that the story would improve.  But in the end I found myself skimming through the pages and continually looking at my Kindle to see how much closer I was to the end.<br /><br />I still think Rowling is an amazing writer, and I'm certain I'll read the next book she decides to publish.  Sadly, though, I should have passed on this one and wouldn't recommend it.

The only problem with the DVD is that Bruce was not highlighted by singing a song that he sings by himself, such as \\"Disney Girls\\".

B00A48ECL6|5.0|As an avid Sherlock Holmes fan since childhood I have watched and reviewed many different interpretations over the years.<br /><br />Elementary has very interesting elements to it, which I believe stand it apart from previous Sherlock Holmes. The first of these elements is that it is set in a modern day, which by itself is not totally unusual as BBC has also produced an SH series which does the same. This gives it somewhat more of a real feeling, as it is not a \\"forensic\\" show persay but more of what Holmes is famous for - Deductive Reasoning.<br /><br />The second of these elements that set it apart is that Dr. Watson is a female. While I am excited about the concept of a female Watson, I remain scepticle about the implications that they will be able to continue to maintain a platonic relationship long-term. While Dr. Watson is traditionally the only person that can weather Holme's somewhat abrasive nature and maintain some semblance of dignity, it just doesnt translate as well to the female gender, even though so far in the show Lucy Liu has done a very admirable job of doing just that.<br /><br />The third element which has been introduced as a seperation to other SH series is the drug addiction. One that I have to say I am not overly fond of. We get the very vague and general sense that Holmes abused drugs as a reaction to a traumatic event that happened previously in his life, but that card has been overly played in modern series.<br /><br />All in all I give this a 5 for casting, great storyline, writing, and originality. The small flaws it has are easily erased by the great dynamics of the crime-fighting duo.

B009NQKPUW|2.0|I was disappointed at what a terrible job the film did at unfolding a story.  I had so many questions about what was going on there was no satisfaction in watching the movie.  I had to go to the internet for answers or what could be answers as it appears many people felt left in the dark.  The characters' behavior was so off the wall it was not believable.  Prometheus had potential for greatness but missed the mark by a couple of light-years.

The loop is you beat the whole thing and then start over.

Prometheus, whose mission, privately funded by Weyland Corp, proposed the exploration of distant Moon Sector LV-223 for the examination of possible alien life forms.<br /><br />This Report has been commissioned by secrets act #5287 to thoroughly investigate and determine the reasons for the loss of the crew, failure of the mission and any or all possible threats to long-term security by the actions of this lost venture.<br /><br />The Weyland Corporation, having been the sole backer of said mission- took upon themselves all responsibility and liabilities without seeking government assistance for it's success and oversight- which- although very unusual for such a high priority mission was due to the powerful Lobbying efforts of Weyland Corp and it's overdue influence on certain unnamed individuals of the Interplanetary Council.<br /><br />It has been known for some years, internally, that Weyland Corp has had general unrest within it's Executive Board of Trustees- Headed by the Factious Element, Meredith Vickers - Who used her close ties with the Senior allied members to place herself as head of the exploratory mission. With written confessions by collaborating engineers and computer scientists among her personal staff, she preplanned a catastrophic failure of this mission to duly disgrace her peers and the 1 Trillion Dollar expenditure; to exploit stockholders deep concerns; to rest final control of the board membership by dooming a venture which was headed and approved by CEO of Weyland Corporation, Peter Weyland.<br /><br />Her plan in detail:<br />-The shifting of funds that were meant to go into the building and design of efficient offense and defensive weapon systems that would counter all potential, reasoned and imagined dangers to the safety of the crew and threaten their safe return.<br /><br />-Diverting Funds to Build and install a `State of the Art' escape craft into the design of the ship Prometheus to safe guard her interests instead, and be at her own ready disposable.<br /><br />-Diverting Funds to bribe military personal into acquiring a biological virus that was engineered to effect enemy competence and turn them into regressive personality types on the battlefield, thus inhibiting the enemies ability to organize and fight among themselves.To be administered covertly to the crew members after initiating standard interspace hibernation procedures.<br /><br />-Diverting funds to pay staff computer scientists to build a programming virus to infect the sub systems of `DAVID' the team robot.<br /><br />A. To subvert the success of said mission at all times while not risking the life of Vickers.<br /><br />B. To appear informative and helpful, while actually preventing successful conclusions to be drawn, or to be elusive if confronted directly.<br /><br />C. To ensure that Earth and Weyland Corp. and it's Board of Trustee's not be exposed to an Alien threat that maybe initiated upon landing and to destroy or divert Alien threats away from Earth at all times-THIS PRIORITY TO OVERRIDE ALL OTHERS<br /><br />-To Direct the Personal Department to sort all applications for mission personal in order of experience and competence in each specialized field, and that only Vickers was to have access to mission personal files. From which she choose the following team members:<br /><br />1. Dysfunctional Ships Captain, Janek , whose prior interplanetary experience consisted of 20 years piloting a supply barge from Jupiter to Venus.<br /><br />2. A Geologist, Fifield, with a history of attacking authority figures and whose prior experience consisted of the grading and sorting of Coal mine Tailings for specific wholesale markets.<br /><br />3. A Biologist, Millburn, who was removed from his post at a Children's Zoo for allowing schoolchildren to handle directly all the creatures in the poisonous animals exhibit while also having a medical history of personal delusions that waiver between running away from imagined threats in panic to running towards real threats in denial of the danger to his and others personal safety.<br /><br />4. Staffing the rest of the Crew with undeveloped character types who seem to have been born without names, ambitions, or the ability to question rash decisions but would blindly follow anyone or any order given to them to collect a desperately needed paycheck.<br /><br />The Board of Trustees who were allied with CEO of Weyland Corporation, Peter Weyland, did not have full confidence in the declared mission, suspecting the intent and plan of Vickers.To ensure their interests they secretly recruited Elizabeth Shaw and convinced her that they needed someone inside to ensure the success of this mission and that it was in her interest and that of her Husband Charlie Holloway to join them.<br /><br />To this end, Archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw, agreed to the following:<br /><br />1. To have a Top Secret Military Vaccine that would give her immunity to the Virus that was to be infected upon the crew- thinking that it would protect her instead from Foreign and Alien Contagion's- This she thought was also to be Administered to her Husband, Archaeologists Charlie Holloway, as part of the agreement.<br /><br />2.

This book is a stand alone story,  you can read it and enjoy it without having ever read about John Corey before. However,  if you have the time and the money, you should start with Plum Island. This is where John Corey makes his first appearance and it is a great book. I believe once you pick up a Nelson Demille, you will want to read them all. Check out The Charm School and The Generals daughter as well if you are in the mood for some mystery.
B001MYIXAW|3.0|I had great expectations about this movie.  Even though I'm not very fond of vampire movies, reviews were very good and some friends had recommended it.  As it turned out, it's just a good pastime, another film I won't be seeing more than once.  Some teenagers, especially those who are fans of vampire stuff, may love it, though.
1451620829|4.0|At times it is alittle bit woe is me but that's just how Peter felt at the time. I do think Peter thinks he played the drums a lot better than he actually did, but that's a matter of taste iguess.
0525953728|5.0|I am a retired Command Master Chief, USN (Hospital Corpsman) who spent 23 years in our Navy.  I had the pleasure on several occasions to be embarked on ships that acted as adversaries (for training purposes) to the Seals (both on East and West Coast).  This book is written with a great amount humility in my mind.  The critics of this book don't have a clue what these men represent in the security of our country.  I believe every word of this book and would not even begin to listen to the politicians and senior officers (yes, I know they are political also)view of what happened during this mission.  Also, I saw nothing in this book that could be considered \\"classified\\" in my opinion.  On a personal note, I am sad that Mark Owen (not real name) decided to leave the Navy so prematurely.  He is a true hero, along with his shipmates, that the Navy cannot afford to lose.  A GREAT BOOK EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ.  SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR ALL SCHOOL STUDENTS!<br /><br />Bravo Zulu<br /><br />Art Taylor<br />HMCM(SW), USN/Retired<br />Command Master Chief
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This book starts out great with the introduction into the world of the walking dead. I look forward to the many more volumes.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book! I've read all of the books by John Grisham and this is one of my favorites. Interesting read!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great mystery. I couldn't put it down. I was a bit surprised at how it ended. I would recommend it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Its entertaing. Something fun to pass the time if you're into simple games. Patience is needed if you don't want to spend too much money for supplies.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but the beginning and middle parts were pretty slow. The \\"boring\\" chapters were still interesting if you were trying to piece everything together and really think about what is going on in the book. While I agree with the other readers that this book was less exciting than the previous books, I don't think someone who has read the first three books should end there. Some of the chapters were really well done and I really enjoyed the surprise near the end.
1451675046|5.0|This is an engagingly written book about the questions of life and the universe that children often ask, like what is the sun?  This renowned scientist has taken 12 questions that bring children and adult readers who should enjoy this as well, into the world of myth and science.  He answers what can be discussed intelligently and opens the future for further knowledge to be discovered on the topic.  What a respectful, engaging and beautifully illustrated book.  I have recommended it to many friends for their children (and selves) and grandchildren.
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|Movies with tons of special effects often lose site of the plot.  Although this movie has a plot, it was a weak one to begin with and not very credible.

B007D2XSW0|2.0|I don't know why but the layer option doesn't work on kindle fire and that is making this app a piece of shit and its screwing up other things too!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Junk. Time wasting, idiotic, compelling as a Saturday movie serial. That's some sort of an achievement. It's heart, if it had one, tries weirdly and wrongly to be in a right place. It just doesn't have the stuff to find one, so it commits a kind of moral genocide.

B007FEZQF8|4.0|Good read. Quick easy and exciting. Nothing like the television show. I think you'll enjoy this thrilling tale of the walking dead
B004VMUS9G|5.0|works great - love the gradual volume increase setting and that you can save different times - very recently experimented with the countdown / shop watch functions and those also were easy to use and worked well

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Very fun game. The free version was exciting and challenging. I loved building different transportation devices for the pigs and watching them fail or succeed. Got three stars on every level but it did take some doing. Really enjoyed it!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a reader would find that books worth reading are worth reading twice and Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is definitely one of them.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is actually the first classic book I've ever read from cover to cover. Since I'm not used to reading classics during that time, it took me ages before I get the hang of the story and eventually finish it. Nevertheless, I was able to appreciate the story and it instantly became my favorite. Well, who would not fall in love with the story of Lizzie and Mr. Darcy?<br /><br />Three years later, this book was chosen as the featured book for the October face-to-face discussion of my book club and so I decided to read it again since I wasn't able to retain most of the details of the story in my memory. It was worth reading twice indeed for I find it sweeter the second time around. For some weird reason, I am really a fan of love-hate story and it was only when I read this book the second time that I realized that this is the best love-hate story I've read so far. It was also in my second time that I was able to appreciate more the care-free character of Elizabeth Bennet, the snob-outside-but-soft-inside character of Mr. Darcy, the annoying character of Mrs. Bennet and the cool father character of Mr. Bennet.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is truly an enduring classic so no wonder it became one of the most popular books in English literature and inspired most of the novels of today and became the favorite subject for film and tv adaptations.
B008QMMEOE|3.0|Decent for what it is, but its such a small app I think it had about 6 puzzles total for the paid version and 3 for the regular version - stay away and look for something that offers your child more variety.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I love this movie so much! Kristen Stewart is awesome in it. I def. recommend this movie to anyone who likes good, dramatic action movies like this one!
1401238580|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a great deal. The book is well made, the packaging is aesthetically pleasing, but you get the standard mask. I was hoping for the Deluxe mask, considering this is a nice set. The description did not say which mask you get, so I guess I was just being optimistic. Still worth the buy. No regrets here.
B0090P98Z4|2.0|you have to use real money to be able to get decent weapons on the game. the boss are unbelievably difficult, and you barley do any damage to any enemy. any game would be more enjoyable than this
B004QPOVE6|5.0|A great concert to be sure, my complaint being too many audience shots(at least it's a very entertaining bunch of 65,000 or so) & slow down the editing please(a usual beef). At times you see more of the audience than you do of the band.That aside, AC/DC always rock and the crowd loves them, I wish crowds up here would be as crazy as the South Americans. A night well worth capturing on video & well worth watching & buying.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Since I first read Morton's Forgotten Garden, I have loved her style and content. However, this is by far her best work!
B0069JBKHI|4.0|I'm updating this review but I'm thrilled to report that the iOS7 update has greatly improved the performance of the viewing app on the iPhone 5!  I'm am so thrilled!  I've struggled with it for a year, still loving the monitor despite it's imperfect performance on iOS6 and the iPhone 5.  It really is a one of a kind monitor!  I also love that you can finally view the monitors (at the same time) from any computer.  This is huge!!!<br /><br />Favorite features: the two way talking feature, the light (I used a green & red light to show my toddler when it was time to sleep and when it was time to get out of bed), and being able to remote monitor.  These three features made the monitor unique, even among other iPhone compatible monitors.<br /><br />The two main complaints I've seen in reviews on various sites about this monitor are true, tho neither were deal breakers for me-<br />1) the monitor shuts down/ loses connectivity once or twice a night, and if you're sleeping you don't know this has occurred, which is troubling if you're monitoring a small child.  I just solve this by using a cheap ($15ish) audio only monitor during the night. If baby wakes, I hear him on the audio monitor and can then turn on this monitor to see what he's doing.  I'm totally fine with this arrangement.<br />2) The night vision isn't awesome, but I've used several other regular video monitors and didn't find this one any worse than those.  Certainly the closer to the child the camera is, the clearer the picture is.  Sometimes the night vision adjusts itself and makes the picture a lot darker (making the picture very hard to see) or a lot brighter (which shows the child clearer).  You can't adjust the night vision yourself, it just does it on its own, and not always for the better.  However, all in all, the night vision is fine.  I appreciate being able to see even my child's outline.<br /><br />Note: When using with more than 1 monitor, there is NOT a great way of switching between monitors- there are about 7 key strokes to get between monitors and you have to do it manually.  It doesn't rotate between monitors automatically.  That makes viewing on the computer nice.  I think of this monitor as my way to see my kids napping during the day and at night when I'm away from home (say on a date and a babysitter is home viewing on my iPad or computer).  I love that I can see my kids sleeping when I'm not home with them.  Withinings told me they were working on a way to swipe between monitors (swipe right/left to see the various monitors) but that it could be awhile before that's available.<br /><br />I love love love love this monitor and I welcome any further questions!there are about 7 key strokes to get between monitors and you have to do it manually.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the bomb! It't so different! In a good way.I can only say one thing: GET THIS APP!!!!!
B007TNS6JI|3.0|I played this game for about three days and absolutely loved it. I liked the fact that you didn't have to buy money on the game to get half the items you want, but that's where the good part ends. its started lagging uncontrollably for me, bad enough that I had to shut off my kindle. it would freeze midgame, then resume with only 10 seconds left to complete the mission. finally, it reset my account. I was a level 31, then it reset my account back to the tutorial and I lost everything I had. I was more bothered when I reported this problem and learner that it was a common problem that they haven't fixed yet. Not worth the hassle.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I highly recommend it.  Watching the Making of Elizabeth and listening to the director's commentary just makes it even more thrilling.
1451620829|5.0|I just finished Peter's book last night - wow!!~  I have to say... just when my opinion of Paul and Gene could not get any lower - it did!  I read the part about how Gene was screwing all these girls and ended up with a nasty herpes outbreak - sores all over his neck and chest  and a doctor had to come to a arena and give him a shot.  And then when Shannon found out about it - she was mad - so Gene had Doc run out and buy Shannon a huge rock - disgusting!  If Shannon is so materialistic that a new ring makes it all ok - they are BOTH disgusting and deserve each other!<br />Oh!!  And.. I was PISSED when I read how Paul and Gene were paying Tommy Thayer $25,000.00 a show - compared to Peter's 10,000.00 - what a slap in the face - it was like both Paul and Gene took great pleasure humiliating him.  It's to bad KISS lost their legacy!  Also.. after reading Peter's book - I think I now know why on KISSonline - they show the \\"band\\" - standing on stage with all the fans behind them at the shows - it's like they are gloating to Ace and Peter - \\"Look at us - and all these people who came to see us - not caring that you two are not around anymore!\\"<br />Karma is a bitch...  I say.. in about 5 years from now - Paul's wife Erin, will bail - she will leave - as soon as the money slows down.  Peter said Pam (Paul's 1st wife) bailed during the Farewell tour and took Paul to the cleaners - I hope Erin does the same.  I also wish Pam would write a tell-all book - I bet she would have some great stories to share~!~!  I would love to see Pam throw Paul under the bus!  I also read that the reason Pam got such a huge payout - was because she agreed not to write any books or go on any talk shows talking about their marriage.<br />I am not really a KISS fan anymore - if they came to my hometown - I would go see them if I got free tickets - but my days of getting on a plane to see them are over.  I am still hoping for one final show with Ace and Peter before it's all over.  Gene needs to lose weight, Paul has so many replacement parts already - knee, hip... I can't see him going on much longer either.  I was so disgusted about how mean Paul and Gene were - it' sounds like Peter has A LOT of hatred towards them - at the end of the book - he talked about wanting to get on a plane to L.A with a gun - and blowing Paul, Gene and Doc's heads off!!  OUCH! I also should add... that in this book - Peter talks about the size of all the band member's penis'...  Peter said that his is the longest, Ace has the thickest, and Paul and Gene were tiny and that Paul would shove socks in his crotch during the 2003 KISS/Aerosmith Tour!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|So interesting to see the thoughts, experiences, of a near death experience nonbeliever. I have been in health care for almost 40 years and have seen and heard so much that to me the shift from life to death and sometimes back again is real and inspiring!
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I have the earlier version with the anamorphic (colored lenses) extra and of course this one blows the first one away. The 3-D was very good with several bits of coming-out-of-the screen action. I thought of getting this one because I had seen Journey to the Center of the Earth:2 3-D which used the same actor for the kid. My only kvetch was that magnesium does not occur in an elemental manner. Other than that, a lot of fun. The 3-D does enhance the the viewing pleasure.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Great effects. Good beginning but the ending runs out of steam and disappointing. As if the production wished a quick end to the film for commercial reasons.<br /><br />However, a great B-Ray combination box set. Great packaging and product. Well done to Marvel. Ordered this instead of the European version as Marvel has failed their European customers by only providing a 1 disc set.
0525953728|5.0|To sit and read this.. I felt like I was there. A non stop page turner. The only bad part was that I know how it ended. Anyone who has been in the Military or has family that serves will really enjoy reading this.

B0085RQLXK|3.0|After waiting eleven years for an album of new material, Aerosmith fans finally have a new album in their hands.<br /><br />Unfortunately, inconsistency is the name of the game for \\"Music From Another Dimension.\\"<br /><br />The good news is there are some very nice songs on the album. Among the standout tracks are \\"Legendary Child\\" and \\"Luv XXX.\\" A few of the tracks have a slight \\"Pump\\" vibe to them and match the feel of Aerosmith's finer moments on \\"Permanent Vacation\\" and \\"Get A Grip\\" from a production standpoint. This is not surprising, since some tracks are reportedly reworked outtakes from the \\"Get A Grip\\" sessions. The album's highlights are easy to spot and I will continue to enjoy those tracks.<br /><br />The bad news is there are several garbage tracks on the album that should have remained on the cutting room floor. The worst offender is the duet with Carrie Underwood, \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You,\\" a sappy pop country tune that, by itself, lowers the album rating a full star. This song is just plain awful and has no place in the Aerosmith catalog. Cheesy lyrics, bland songwriting, and forgettable performances abound make this track a thoroughly miserable listening experience for the Aerosmith fan. What is most absurd about this song is the fact that Aerosmith, one of the greatest rock and roll bands to ever take the stage, doesn't need Carrie Underwood to put an album on the charts. At this stage of their career, Aerosmith are free to put out a true rock and roll album that their fans will pick up in masse. Shame on you guys for selling out on this one when you didn't have to.<br /><br />\\"Music From Another Dimension\\" could have been an excellent album had it been chopped down to ten or eleven of its better songs. With the Deluxe Edition clocking in at sixteen tracks, there is simply too much drivel on the album to bury its finer moments. Album producers have traditionally helped bands trim the fat on releases like this. The end result is supposed to result ina lean, tight product with songs that belong and flow for the listener. Unfortunately, Aerosmith have decided to release an album that requires generous use of the \\"skip\\" button to enjoy. The end result is a C+ effort on what should have been an ace in the hole.
1616960922|2.0|I'm a sucker for great cover art and this one pulled me right in. Unfortunately the story itself is just not very fulfilling and feels like a badgering moral tale. One of the reasons I fell away from fantasy is because of the over-abundance of unpronounceable, forgettable names. That tradition runs deep here and it makes an already ho-hum read all the more laborious for it.<br /><br />I think I'll wait out the next one. 2 out of 5 stars mostly because it wasn't terribly expensive and struck me as a good value at the time, but for an afternoon's read, I would have preferred to have spent my time with other tales.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|If you're happier that your mobile website is getting more hits  than your mobile app thaan you have major problems with your app. Lousy connections and terrible interface make for a terrible mobile experience.
0812984412|5.0|As the author recognizes in his post-movie afterward, the book and the movie are not one and the same.  I came to the book after the movie, to get more of the story, to understand how the book structure works compared to the movie structure.  I got a great read, where karma-twists are clearer, informed by additional events not in the movie, yet the same message, nutshelled in the book's last line, in Adam Ewings' words, \\"Yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?\\"<br /><br />I can't wait to read Mitchell's other books!!

B008OOYALE|5.0|i love it thats all i have to say. about how cute the dragons are and how you have to get them two the next level. its worth your time and effort
B009ICYPOS|2.0|Although not expecting a fantasy adventure for adults, was still taken aback at the bleakness of this novel on small town politics.  Certainly black, but no humour.<br />I found no redeeming qualities in the characters.  Perhaps the writer has a hidden agenda?  Possibly she is living in a village in the countryside and has got to know the various people too well.<br />She paints a picture of most of the ills of society compressed in a small area ticked off one by one.  Drug use, sociopaths, racism, abuse of many sorts - both physical and mental, suicide...the list goes on.<br />Bring back the fantasy - adults love it as much as children.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Excellent writing & acting.  I thought I might be dissapointed because of all of the great reviews, but it deserves all the hype it has received.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I didn't go into this with high hopes but I thou ht it was a cute well written romantic drama.
B009439HEY|5.0|Take it from someone who was digging Steve and Genesis in the 70s. Saw both the \\"Selling England\\" and \\"Lamb Lies Down\\" tours with Gabriel + a couple of years later, the \\"Wind & Wuthering\\" tour: This is great. \\"The Lamia\\" is nearly tear-inducing - too many highlights to count. Hackett's been back stronger than ever for a few years with no hint of a let-up!
B008458O3S|4.0|Well my 6 yr old who loves and knows all about trains of course likes this app and it was fairly easy to do so far. Simple game with clear colorful graffics.<br />Florida Mom<br />Ps. I did turn off the Wifi to make sure he couldn't access any links. Parental permission on too so you can rest easy while your kids enjoy a game that works out their brain.  lol. Enjoy!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Amazing book that's keeps you on the edge! Fantastic! Heart melts for this couple and the heart breaking stories that are within.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|RECOMMENDED!<br />A great and yet simple movie that made me laugh and even drop a tear or two.<br />I wonder how Portman can always connect in some way with the audience. She is so natural that sometimes you can think that you are watching a real life soft drama as if you were there and things were actually happening in front of your eyes instead of looking through a screen.<br />Kutcher does not disappoint in any sense. There is nothing to add or take to his performance in this movie.<br />Good supporting characters as well.

B0027MJU00|5.0|Highly suggest if you enjoy suspense/mystery books. Also recommend Sharp Objects. What a dark, creepy, but wonderful ride this book takes you on.
B007PKSN6Q|2.0|I'm a huge fan of rock music, and a fan of most of the cast of this movie.  Perhaps my expectations were a little high, but I found it to be lacking.  It seems they couldn't make up their minds if they wanted to be campy, a \\"slice of the 80's\\", a love story, or a comedy.  It would seem they tried all and didn't pay enough attention to any.  I can't recommend it.

B008S80OU2|5.0|After an incomplete and sporadic run of remastered CD re-releases (in 2001 and 2007), seminal American hard-rock/metal band Blue Oyster Cult's full back catalog from their years at CBS is being released in remastered form, courtesy of this boxed set.  For the impatient hardcore BOC fans, I'll quickly sum up the most essential details for this release.  The 16 CDs (all official studio and live albums from \\"Blue Oyster Cult\\" through \\"Imaginos\\" and 2 bonus CDs) and 1 DVD (a live show from the Spectres tour) come in cardboard \\"mini LP\\" sleeves that are meant to be reproductions of the vinyl album sleeves. While this does make this great for saving space, the lack of jewelcases means that this set is essentially without lyrics booklets, and requires one to be a little more careful when removing the CDs.  The booklet that comes with this collection is disappointing; for a band with such a dense and interesting history, 3 small pages for the band's history just isn't enough, nor are there any lyrics included.  On the bright side, Sony has included a \\"download voucher\\" for MP3s of 4 concerts from the 1980s.  In terms of bonuses, the good news is that the bonus tracks from the 2001/2007 remasters have all been retained.  Unfortunately, Sony hasn't added any bonus tracks to the other remastered discs, and has mostly concentrated on \\"live rarities\\".  There is a rather long list of unreleased songs/demos that they could have picked from, but chose to ignore.  You do get \\"John L. Sullivan\\", from the band's \\"Soft White Underbelly\\" pre-history, as well as 3 rather forgettable songs written for the \\"Teachers\\" soundtrack, in addition to the admittedly awesome selection of live cuts (which include the 1972 \\"Live Bootleg\\" EP, and oft-circulated live tracks such as \\"Wings of Mercury\\").  Overall, the sound quality is pretty good (see below for more specific comments on individual albums), although I'm not sure if the previously released remasters have been tweaked a little to match the new remasters.  In any case, while it's a bitter pill for hardcore fans to essentially have to repurchase remasters they already have, in order to get the ones they don't, this compromise had to be made in order to convince Sony to finish the remastering project started over a decade ago.<br /><br />With their debut, \\"Blue Oyster Cult\\", the band emerged from its struggles under their prior \\"Soft White Underbelly\\"/\\"Stalk-Forrest Group\\" incarnations, shedding most of the \\"San Francisco sound\\" that they had partially adopted.  A pattern was set, which saw a melding of Black Sabbath's early metal riffing, the keyboard-seasoned \\"baroque roadhouse\\" sound of the Doors, early 1970s boogie rock, and outright psychedelia a la Pink Floyd.  With a rather wide range of artistic collaborators guiding their lyrical vision, the intricate wordplay kept pace with the wide variety of musical panoramas the band generated.  As a result, even the muted, somewhat muddy production (cleaned up as much as possible on the remaster) couldn't blunt the impact of psycho-psychadelic songs like \\"Screams\\", or the angular, early metal riffs of \\"Cities on Flame\\", \\"Transmaniacon MC\\", or \\"Stairway to the Stars\\".  Written on the road during relentless touring, their next album, \\"Tyranny and Mutation\\", is more trebly, twitchy, and edgy sounding.  Songs like \\"The Red and The Black\\", \\"OD'd on Life Itself\\", and \\"Hot Rails To Hell\\" are visceral and in your face, with production that is suitably sharp and nasty.<br /><br />But it was \\"Secret Treaties\\" that would prove to be the masterwork of their early period.  Incorporating/codifying much of the twisted mythos the band had built with manager Sandy Pearlman's meta-conceptual input, \\"Secret Treaties\\" is an early metal classic.  Whether it's the metallic grind of \\"Harvester of Eyes\\", \\"Cagey Cretins\\", and \\"Career of Evil\\", the keyboard-laden psychosis of \\"Flaming Telepaths\\", or the nightmarish metal balladry of \\"Astronomy\\", the band was hitting on all cylindershere.  \\"On Your Feet or On Your Knees\\" was the band's bid at conveying the live show experience, and here, the remastering is thankfully good.  While there's still a bit of mud in the mix, cymbals are no longer almost inaudible, and the mix is fairly clear now, making live epics such as \\"7 Screaming Dizbusters\\" that much more effective.  With \\"Agents of Fortune\\", the band struck out for a much more mainstream sound.  While their dark yet jangly mega-hit \\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\" put a whole new spin on gothic proto-metal, much of the other material seemed to aim more at competing with Fleetwood Mac, albeit with a much harder edge.  That said, \\"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\\", \\"Sinful Love\\", \\"Tenderloin\\" and other songs come off with all the requisite menace of a genuine artistic effort, as opposed to a bandwagon-hopping cash-in.  \\"Spectres\\" saw the band trying to balance their newfound pop-influences with a bit more heaviness than \\"Agents\\", with \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"Golden Age of Leather\\" providing heaviness to balance the poppier/lighter songs like \\"Goin' Thru The Motions\\" and \\"I Love the Night\\", both of which easily proved that the Cult was just as adept at writing accessible music.<br /><br />\\"Some Enchanted Evening\\" was a bit of a disappointment, as it saw the band relying too heavily on covers of other artists, although the expanded edition here makes up for that with tracks like \\"5 Guitars\\" and \\"Hot Rails To Hell\\".  Their next studio album, \\"Mirrors\\", skewed far more towards the commercial end of the spectrum, in part due to the participation of staff producer Tom Werman.  That being said, songs like \\"The Vigil\\", \\"I Am The Storm\\", and \\"The Great Sun Jester\\" don't stray too far from the basic Blue Oyster Cult ethos.  \\"Mirrors\\" also is another album that benefits greatly from the remastering; while the production is still thinner than other BOC albums, it sounds much fuller than ever before, with much more audible bass frequencies.  \\"Cultosaurus Erectus\\" marked a move back in a heavier direction, while still keeping some pop influences, with such diverse tracks as the metal-jazz mix of \\"Monsters\\" and the eerie new age pop of \\"Deadline\\".  \\"Fire of Unknown Origin\\" saw the band incorporating a drier, more sparse sound.  Some of the songs were originally intended for the soundtrack to the animated movie \\"Heavy Metal\\" (\\"Veteran of the Psychic Wars\\", \\"Vengeance (The Pact)\\"), but the album may be most notable for the reggae-influenced hit \\"Burnin' For You\\".  The live album \\"Extraterrestrial Live\\" marked the end of Albert Bouchard's tenure as drummer and major songwriting contributor with the band.  \\"The Revolution By Night\\" managed to generally succeed even in his absence, awash with synthesizers and booming, reverbed drums, and balanced by some intense guitar work.  Once again, the remastering manages to bring new life to an album that was thin sounding when originally released on CD; tracks such as \\"Shooting Shark\\" drip with ambient detail now.<br /><br />Unfortunately, further complications within the band were clearly taking their toll.  \\"Club Ninja\\" was a less than consistent effort, even if \\"Dancin' In the Ruins\\", \\"Perfect Water\\", and \\"Spy in the House of  the Night\\" were all great hard-pop songs.  Following the tour for this album, the band appeared to be all but finished, as keyboardist/guitarist Allen Lanier had departed prior to Club Ninja's recording, and bassist Joe Bouchard left afterwards.  However, Blue Oyster Cult still had one last album for CBS, even if it was only barely a BOC album lineup-wise.  \\"Imaginos\\" was originally intended to be an Albert Bouchard solo album, when its incubation began years earlier.  By the time it was released as a Blue Oyster Cult album (mostly to capitalize on name recognition), literally about 20 people had performed on it, including all 5 original members.  \\"Imaginos\\", as overproduced as some might characterize it, was in its essence at the very heart of BOC's creative codex, as a concept album that revisited storylines and themes developed in the band's early life.  Direly in need of remastering, and long out of print, for some, this reissue alone will be a selling point for the box set.  While it still bears what some might consider \\"thin\\" or \\"dated\\" late eighties overproduction, it sounds better than ever.  Songs like \\"Blue Oyster Cult\\" (a completely worked-over reinterpretation of \\"The Subhuman\\") and \\"Del Rio's Song\\" are much easier to listen to now.  Unfortunately for the band, an almost total lack of promotion killed any chances for success, and when Sony bought out CBS, the band's long relationship with the label was unceremoniously axed.  It would be a decade before the band would release a full-length album of new material.<br /><br />Despite the disappointing lack of new studio bonus tracks, and the less than ideal packaging/booklet, this collection has a lot of great music on it.  Much like Queen and Rush, Blue Oyster Cult managed to avoid being a \\"one trick pony\\".  For hardcore fans, this is one is a no-brainer, if you have the funds.

B0049VZ222|5.0|One of the best shows ever. The first season is by far the best and sets the stage for season 2 by building all the characters in a great way.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Another enjoyable story with twist from Mr Grisham. The first novel read in quite a while, shame that the second novel was Karma by the supposed Dan Brown.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow what an ending...I was happy that they actually gave an after all the craziness ending and not just leaving it to the imagination...happy they had there family
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|What a fun movie!  Thirty years have passed since The Muppet Show aired its last episode.  Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and the rest of the cast have all scattered to individual pursuits.  Their old television studio sits in ruins.  A young fan named Walter (actually a muppet himself) visits the studio with his brother Gary (Jason Segel) and Gary's longtime girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams), to fulfill a lifetime dream.  While there, he overhears the evil plot of oil baron Tex Richman (Chris Cooper), who is planning to take over the studio and destroy it for the oil that lies underneath.  The only way out is to raise $10 million . . . and soon.  Walter purposes to reunite the Muppets for a fund-raising telethon to save the studio and thereby the Muppet legacy.  Can they raise the money in time?  Or does no one care anymore about the Muppets?<br /><br />This movie has it all--sympathetic characters, action, comedy, romance and musical numbers.  And it all works.  Particularly hilarious are the multiple times that the actors \\"break the fourth wall\\" and speak directly to the audience about the movie.  An extensive number of cameos by well-known actors round out the fun.<br /><br />Critics were pleased as well.  Rotten Tomatoes gives it an impressive 96% rating.  With this film, Segel has successfully reinvigorated the Muppet franchise.  A sequel has already been announced.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is top-notch.  Audio and visual are both strong.  Colors are vibrant, and the sound is clear.  The disc contains a number of special features, which are all listed in the product description above.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Muppets for all ages.  It is a \\"must see.\\"  More movies like this, please.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|L.W., although written 150 years ago, is as charming and entertaining today as any modern tome written today. I read it in my 20s and enjoyed it as much inn my 40s. Rarely do I reread any books,  but L.W. is timeless annd a wonderful escape from modern daily life. Each character is unique and special and believable.<br />Each entertwined story is as interesting as the next, you truly don't wish the story to end.<br />Again, if you've never read a 19th  century classic before, Little Women will grab and hold you throughout the entire book.<br />L.W. is appropriate for all ages and especially &#34;tweens&#34;  may receive a positive lesson in ambitions and decorum by enjkoying the way life was for their ancestors 150 years ago.<br />This is an all-aroud 5-Star book any age girl won't want to put down..
030759565X|5.0|First, some people's reviews are absolutely worthless. This book is not billed as a \\"dessert cookbook\\" and it makes absolutely no sense that you would be expecting that ESPECIALLY if you're following Deb's blog. Also... why would you expect an author not to write about their family, or in this case Deb's son? If you are that much of a miserable person, it's still ok because it's entirely possible to simply skip the entire introduction to the recipe and simply read the recipe.<br /><br />With that aside, I LOVE THIS COOKBOOK. I've had it since the 30th and in twelve days of owning it, I have made four recipes multiple times. Everything I've made has been received with rave reviews from friends and I can't wait to keep cooking from the book! I love that the book reads like Deb's blog and I'm really enjoying just reading the cookbook. While there are a few things in the book I probably won't be trying, those things are far outweighed by the things  I've made and already love! If you're a follower of smittenkitchen.com you NEED this book. This is very much an every day cookbook, there aren't any crazy recipes requiring crazy things and gobs of time.

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|very interesting and engaging.  wasnt too easy but not so difficult that i got stuck or had to consult a walkthrough.  ready for the sequel :-)
B0096I9UTE|4.0|Have you noticed how the long-present artists shift their image gradually (Madonna, Mariah Carey)? Kylie Minogue, for her part, took a little different path to tread. Taking her big hits and reworking them with orchestra at the famous Abbey Road studios, her transformation into adult songstress is rather rapid and surprising, but very welcome.<br />Often dismissed as a bubblegum pop princess, she nevertheless showed her longevity with arguably the best record of her career in 2010 (\\"Aphrodite\\"), and after coming up with a greatest hits album earlier this year, she now offers this cross section of her career.<br />And what is most striking at this collection - stripping all the beats and gloss, the bare songs are truly fine, the closer \\"Never Too Late\\" so touching that I can even imagine it sung by great voices of Ella Fitzgerald or Frank Sinatra...
B0054PSY2W|5.0|This movies is amazing!  Great music and great acting!  The story is also fantastic.  The cast is awesome!  I highly recommend this movie!!

1452111014|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2WXJYS4RCBQWC]]Wreck-It Ralph has an interesting premise that will probably tickle gamers. It's amusing to see how gaming is spoofed. The book features the concept art, character designs, storyboards and colorscripts. There are lots of funny ideas and art.<br /><br />The book is split into roughly three parts that correspond to the game worlds that Ralph has to travel through. There's the 8-bit world, the First Person Shooter world, and finally the Sugar Rush world where the go-karts are racing.<br /><br />The first part looks at the 8-bit world as realised in 3D. The character designs are the cute big-head-short-legs type. I was looking out for game villains designs for the nostalgia but there aren't as many compared to the other characters.<br /><br />The FPS world is a strong juxtaposition from the two other worlds. The concept art here looks like they can for Halo, Mass Effect, or Gears of War. There are background art, vehicles and the technology. The only giveaway is the more caricatured character faces, cute cy-bugs and Ralph's armoured suit showing his big belly.<br /><br />The last part featuring the Sugar Rush world will get you into a sugar high just from looking at the pictures. There are landscape paintings of chocolate and candy, fluffy candy floss clouds, house of cakes, candy go-karts, biscuit soldiers and donut cops. There are even photos of the staff making models out of real confectionery. I feel unhealthy already after looking at so much sugar.<br /><br />The contrasting worlds and their quirky game characters makes this a wonderful artbook.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
0393317552|5.0|This book takes a new look at how and where and when humans developed and spread.  Mr. Diamond brings up several facts that I had never thought about.  For example, agriculture (and therefore civilization) spreads in an east-west direction much faster and easier than north-south.  This is why Europe and Asia developed faster than the Americas or Africa.  He also mentions the availability of large domesticable animals, which were more common in Europe and Asia.

B008OOYALE|5.0|enjoyable game..I like that you can give gold to neighbors,  takes time but better than spending $$  Recommend if you like these types of games.
1439156816|5.0|This is an important book that every serious writer should read. Stephen King's approach to writing is practical and more akin to blue collar working class people than academics. Simply put he brings understanding and clarity to the writing process. And his hilarious musings on writing workshops is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />What struck me most in reading this highly entertaining work is how much of himself the author poured into the book. It was partly written after suffering a road accident that nearly killed him. As a result he bares his soul in ways that other writers only dare to do through their fictional characters. After reading this I feel I know him. Of everything I've read over the years this is now one of my very favorite books.

B003NTSBUG|5.0|I have just bought my copy of Shutter Island on dvd a few days ago. The premise starts out typical as two U.S Police Marshalls on a ship that heads towards the mental asylm on a investgation. Then things starts to kick off as the one of the Marshall sees the complex of the building and police staff and of course the shady doctor. I know this is little info of my experience of the video, but this is full of \\"WOW\\" at every turn.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|So far it's been an okay way to waste time.  The games are entertaining and kind of challenging for the most part, but easy enough for the kiddos.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|The special effects [CG's, etc] make this movie worth watching. The plot is nothing special. The acting is OK. This movie is kinda like Avatar. Awesome visuals, but a worn out plot. I would watch it again for the special effects. Also, the bigger the screen you watch it on makes it better.

1589795474|5.0|Dr. Thomas Stanley has done a great job here in examining the statistics behind the most affluent 4% of our society in the USA. You might be surprised to learn that the vast majority of millionaires are not in glamourous fields of work. Most of them are not Wall Street Investment Bankers, or professional sports athletes, or movie stars, or CEOs of Fortune 500 companies... those people represent only a tiny minority of the millionaires. Many millionaires are men in their 50's who own a boring little company that does something like roofing or street paving or other home improvements. They do not live in fancy homes, and they do not drive luxurious cars.<br />My own business, selling rare and antique Bibles at The Bible Museum (See: GREATSITE DOT COM), is certainly not the \\"typical\\" path to success that most people have pursued... but it is helpful to understand the background of most of my customers who can afford to buy Bibles costing many thousands of dollars each. These individuals are the backbone of our economy.<br />As a curious side-note: I am personally quoted in this best-selling book at the top of page 229, and Dr. Thomas Stanley is one of my \\"FaceBook Friends\\".  :)

B009V5KI98|4.0|Annie looks great on Amazon Instant Video. I remember watching this on a tiny, grainy TV from the 80's. It's modern presentation in high definition with surround sound is a whole new experience. I have really begun to think that disc based media is finally obsolete.

This works great on my Tivo, but the audio won't work at all on my PS3. Fix this please, Amazon.
1579128955|4.0|Many people simply fail to grasp the awesome simplicity of the fact that everything known to physically exist in the visible universe is made up of only about a hundred basic elements. While ancient civilizations conjectured that all matter was made up of some mix of fire, water, earth, and air... we have known for centuries that it is a little more complicated than that... yet it remains surprisingly simple. Theodore Gray has given us something far beyond a boring chemistry or geology textbook here... this is a visually compelling presentation of \\"matter for the masses\\". The reader is given an opportunity to see every element in its most pure and presentable form. Sometimes, this is easy: a piece of carbon, iron, nickel, tin, gold, silver, platinum, or palladium, can easy be photographed as a chunk of rock... but how do we photographically exemplify the simplest element: hydrogen? And what about more exotic members of the periodic table, like iridium, plutonium, or xenon? And how could we possibly \\"show\\" the most recently-discovered real estate on the periodic table... the mainly radioactive elements that not only do not occur naturally, but can only be made to exist in a laboratory for a tiny fraction of one second before rapidly undergoing an atomic change that renders them something else?<br />The author does a great job of showing us all that can be shown, and helping us to visualize that which essentially cannot be shown. This book is basically a study of every physical thing known to exist, in a way that categorizes those building blocks of reality with style, flair, and intrigue.<br />The only criticism I have of this book is that the author repeatedly hammers-home his own ecological agenda of criticism regarding the inefficiency of incandescent lighting. Of course, I agree with his argument to a point... but he goes a bit overboard in repetition regarding this one soap box issue.<br />As Dennis Miller said, \\"I will never have fluorescent lighting in my living room, because I don't want my living room to look like an Eastern European stairwell in a fight scene from the Bourne Ultimatum.\\" Having said that, I am hopeful that technology will soon advance toward efficient lighting that is both pleasant and efficient.<br />But I digress... do not hold that one little thing against this book. It is a commendable work, and an excellent reference work for everyone from the home-schooler to the book collector to the science nut... like me.ng room, because I don't want my living room to look like an Eastern European stairwell in a fight scene from the Bourne Ultimatum.\\" Having said that, I am hopeful that technology will soon advance toward efficient lighting that is both pleasant and efficient.<br />But I digress... do not hold that one little thing against this book.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I usually don't write reviews but I was shocked by how taken I was with this story. The book was recommended after I'd finished reading the Fifty Shades Trilogy, which I thought was good but a bit graphic for a romance. Beautiful Disaster was a well-written love story and went through the ups and downs of all relationships, including jealousy, breakups and makeups, along with some twists that you wouldn't expect. I was intrigued the entire read and am excited that a sequel is in the works. Recommended to anyone who likes a good romance read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I should have never started this series until the last book was available. Now I'm on the edge of my seat trying to find another book to fill in the time until May 2013. This second book is nothing like Fifty and leaves you wanting to know more and more about the characters. I absolutely loved it!

I have been doing this workout for four days and have been very sore but my energy level has gone up surprisingly. I will update review on day 30 .
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nice pace, suspenseful, lots of interesting tidbits about the history of the investigative organizations.  A little anti-climatic at the end.  Sometimes I tire of John Corey's continual wisecracking, but in this book I got a better sense of why this character uses this means of self-defense/preservation.  DeMille's books are typically well-edited so I don't get caught up in the aggravation of bad grammar and misspelled words, which makes my reading experience more satisfying.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a good mindless game to pass the time. Use it while waiting for an appointment and the kids love to play with it.

Fortunately he is joined by some like-minded friendly gamers; unfortunately he also ends up in a fight for his virtual and real life against players representing a greedy corporation.<br /><br />The best part of Ready Player One is its numerous references to eighties culture:  games, movies, computer hardware, and even some books.  For a reader such as myself who came of age during that time, the references will bring back many fond memories.  I did feel that the middle third of the book lagged somewhat, because the plot didn't really start to pick up until the later chapters.  The ending however will leave you cheering.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer definitely meets the high standard that John Grisham has set for himself. It was hard to put down and thoroughly entertaining. Can't wait for the next one to be published! Love Grisham!

B000RLHDUM|5.0|Great movie with lots of action and romance. It's likely to be a classic whether it's this one or the original.
B008458O3S|4.0|Trainyard is definitely more Challenging and Enjoyable than it appears to be.  The Puzzles get more Complex and they have nice Tutorials to help you along.  Well designed and works Smoothly on Xoom Tablet.  Good Graphics Sounds and Function.  It could use some Sprucing up with Fancier Graphics and more Fun Sounds though.  Definitely addictive because of the nicely designed challenges but can be more Lively with more Vibrant Graphics, etc.  The only negatives so far are the Permissions, Advertising, Pop-ups for other apps, connections to Facebook, etc.  Overall, a SOLID  FUN FILLED APP.  I Recommend it to Physics/Puzzle game lovers.

B009RI4FRU|3.0|I downloaded this movie to watch on my return airplane trip. (I was one of the options on the way across country, but no movies were offered on the way home.)  It was very quirky, but entertaining.  It helped pass the time. Not a theater price attraction.
0307591549|2.0|I tend to rate things based on how much I use the book after I read it. I didn't find this book particularly interesting. In the methodology of academics everywhere, the book spends a lot of time promoting its own promises of self-fulfillment (you can change your life! just read this book!), bright orange cover and little or no time actually telling you what to do.<br />Lots of anecdotes about the author lecturing companies about how happiness changes you for the better. Lots of studies saying happiness makes you more efficient, more effective, more productive, more of a team player, more successful. It's like the difference between a marketing piece and an owner's manual. This is a marketing piece. Lots of verbiage dedicated to how great happiness is and how much it will help you to succeed, complete with studies, research, anecdotes and so forth.<br />I got to a certain point the in the book where it finally occurred to me. The author has little or nothing to say about what actually to do to achieve these outcomes. This book is all about promotion, more precisely promoting the author's point of view.<br />On the positive side, the research is right on the money, these principles are correct. But if you were hoping to figure out how to apply them in your life from reading this book, sorry, look somewhere else.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic game from the makers of Flow Free. If you have not already purchased it, it would be practically criminal not to pick it up while it is free here!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I think the movie was a lot of fun, and Tom Cruise might be crazy as they come but the man has guts.  There's no way they'd get me to do the stunts he did on the Burj, and I know he did them himself because I read a couple of articles where his stunt man backed out on doing them.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|had a great time with this game. puzzles were fun with challenges.  would recommend this game for all ages. good times
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very addicting!  lots of fun and never had to spend a dime! I even got my friends hooked. once you start you can't stop.
B008458O3S|3.0|The game is pretty solid, and although it looks like something you've played before it is surprisingly unique.  What the game lacks is any kind of effort in the graphics department.  It is pretty low budget, and although I believe noodlecake (the developer) obviously prefers function over graphics, it is still below the standards of something like Stick Man Golf (another noodlecake title), which does have it's own style, while Trainyard has none.  I believe the game can really shine with just a little effort on the graphics so it doesn't look underdeveloped.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is a great app. Simple, enjoyable and interesting recipes you can build off of as you gain experience. My favorite part is the grocery list section. I can add a recipe to my shopping list and sort by recipe or by aisle so it's hard to find an excuse not to cook. The most educational part would be the videos on technique. It's one thing to see it on a show and another to have an expert on-demand as you go. Thanks so much for this app, no problems on my Xoom or Motorola Defy XT.

I watched the tv series and loved it, but the book gave you more of an insight into the man Walt is and how he processes things in his mind.  I am so glad that Henery is such a good friend as Walt needs him.  I will be ordering more Longmire books!!!!!

B004USRKX8|5.0|I got the lp, and the original CD issue.  And I hadn't seen any mention about this 2011 edition in terms of whether it is merely a re-release, or has someone re-mastered it.  But I bit and when I got it I was shocked to hear how buzzy and distorted it sounded on the little computer satellite system I got in the bedroom.  But with a decent CD player though a decent stereo, it's a whole 'nother story.  Very thick and rich.  Almost like the decision was to give it more the original sound than the heightened clarity that most recent digital aims for.  This is the first time I've ever run into a CD where there seems to be a need to get sufficient power to the bass and midrange to keep it from distorting. (?) It ain't analog, but it sure is nice.
1250004217|5.0|For my first quarter of sophomore year in high school, I read Sarah's Key by Tatiana De Rosnay. My friend recommended it to me while reading it for summer reading. This book contains parallel stories, one taking place during the time of the Holocaust and one taking place sixty years later.<br /> Sarah Starzynski, a ten-year old girl, is rounded up with her family and all the other Jewish families in Paris, July of 1942. The French police goes from door to door, arresting many families in the middle of the night. Sarah has a little brother, Michel, who hides in a cupboard in their house so that he can survive. He is only four years old and Sarah is hoping to go back to her apartment and save her brother. These families are then taken to an arena where everyone was challenged to survive as long as possible without any food or water. During this time, many parents and children died of starvation and dehydration before people came to nurse the children. Sarah had witnessed sites she had never even imagined of seeing. Many included death. After Sarah and her parent had all survived, they were taken out of the arena and shipped to a camp. Later, Sarah and her mother were separated from her father and she never saw him again. At the camp, these poor people were treated with disgrace, like they weren't people at all. They were fed very little or nothing at all with almost no water. The conditions they were managing to live in were extremely unsanitary, causing death instantly for many. Later, all the children were separated from their mothers. Sarah was one of the oldest girls in the group of children, so she cared for many of the young ones. Sarah and a friend make a plan to escape the camp and end up being successful. They run away as far as possible from the camp and end up in an old couples home. The husband and wife take care of the two girls, but one of them ends up passing away from disease. Sarah later tells the couple that she needs to go back to Paris and retrieveher brother from the cupboard. So the three of them take a Train to Paris, and Sarah's story ends with misery.<br /> Sixty years later, in Paris, a woman by the name of Julia lives with her husband Bertrand and her daughter Zoe. Julia has a mediocre job and wants to do something different for a change. She starts doing research on the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup of '42. She goes to talk to her husbands grandmother, also referred to as Mame, who lived in Sarah's apartment after her family was taken away. But Mame is unable to answer many of Julia's curious questions because she is suffering from Alzheimer's. Julia and Bertrand end up divorcing because of the baby they are expecting. Julia ends up naming her second daughter after her inspiration, Sarah Starzynski.<br /> I thought the book was intriguing and left you wondering what would happen next every time one side of the story ended. It was a heartwarming and truly sensational piece to have read. I enjoyed how Sarah's and Julia's stories connected in the end of the book. The only thing I disliked was the fact that Sarah's story stopped in the middle of the book.
160774273X|5.0|I have made bread before but not an expert by any means.  I would consider myself a good home cook.  I read the entire book before I baked any bread and found it to be excellent.  The bread is terrific and recipes very detailed.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I can't believe how much I enjoyed this book. I wanted something light to read on my honeymoon. This was anything but, however I enjoyed it just as much. I it reminded me of the way I felt when I was reading the Twilght series. I totally recommend this book to hopless romatics.
0316228532|1.0|I really struggled to be enthralled by this book and it is one of the most boring books that I have ever read. I read on average 2 books per week but this one did not give me the enthusiasm to not put it down. I kept waiting for the action thinking the next chapter would be it, but it didn't gain my interest really until almost the end!!!
B0018YIW4S|5.0|Wow - these guys were the best thing going in hard rock from around 1977-78 - the Lights Out/Obsession period.  The band took a big dive when guitarist Michael Schenker left after this tour, but the entire band is at their peak and tight as can be here.  The sound quality is fantastic; every instrument is clear - certainly better then most of the studio-recorded albums of this era.  I was at the show recorded at the International Amphitheater in Chicago, and I can tell you the sound is like night and day compared to the horrible \\"acoustics\\" we endured in that dump of a cow barn.  Hard to believe something of this high quality came out of that hellhole.
0525241248|5.0|This book is a good, short read. The author likes the uncared block a little too much, but overall, I would read this again.

B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|Only four episodes in and season three blows away the prior two seasons. This episode is just superb and cements the excellent TV that is The Walking Dead. Just when you thought the group might have some semblance of normalcy, things get hectic quickly. Andrew Lincoln and Sarah Wayne Callies do a tremendous job acting in this episode. I've watched it two more times since it aired!

B00992CF6W|4.0|I LOVE this game! I can't purchase the PC version at this time so this perfect for now. I wish the game was more advanced but I'm happy with it. I have not had any problems with it being slow or anything. It works perfectly. This belongs in your library. Happy crafting!
1451695195|5.0|more than it is a \\"proof\\" of heaven, except from the author's perspective.  What I love about this book is the fact that we have a man of science (neuroscience no less,) who has spent the better part of his life operating (literally) from a very typical reductionist mindset, coupled with a western approach to medicine in conjunction with some clearly atheistic tendencies - throwing a triple extra-large monkey wrench into current mind/consciousness scientific dogma.  Dr. Alexander is a rebel with a clue, a certified turncoat in the most egregious sense of the word; he is uniquely qualified to have made the journey that he describes in the book and debunk any psychosexual/physio-temporal/material-reductionist explanation mainstream science chooses to whitewash his experience with.<br /><br />Admittedly, there was a bit more hyperbole regarding the minutiae of his physical life as opposed to the wisdom and information he gleaned on his expedition, but my guess is that will be fodder for another book.  That said, Dr. A. propounds that he has it on very good authority that we are in fact: loved & cherished deeply, never alone and that there is nothing that we can do wrong (paraphrased;) hmmmmmm, sounds absolutely, well, DIVINE!  A five star piece that took an awful lot of courage to write.  Well done with much thanks!
1583334386|5.0|This book starts out seeming to belabor ideas that seem obvious to me, but before too long it offers counterintuitive approaches that I ought to try.<br /><br />The approach that I find hardest to reconcile with my intuition is that self-forgiveness over giving into temptations helps increase willpower, while feeling guilt or shame about having failed reduces willpower, so what seems like an incentive to avoid temptation is likely to reduce our ability to resist the temptation.<br /><br />Another important but counterintuitive claim is that trying to suppress thoughts about a temptation (e.g. candy) makes it harder to resist the temptation. Whereas accepting that part of my mind wants candy (while remembering that I ought to follow a rule of eating less candy) makes it easier for me to resist the candy.<br /><br />A careless author could have failed to convince me this is plausible. But McGonigal points out the similarities to trying to follow an instruction to not think of white bears - how could I suppress thoughts of white bears of some part of my mind didn't activate a concept of white bears to monitor my compliance with the instruction? Can I think of candy without attracting the attention of the candy-liking parts of my mind?<br /><br />As a result of reading the book, I have started paying attention to whether the pleasure I feel when playing computer games lives up to the anticipation I feel when I'm tempted to start one. I haven't been surprised to observe that I sometimes feel no pleasure after starting the game. But it now seems easier to remember those times of pleasureless playing, and I expect that is weakening my anticipation or rewards.

B0063B2BNE|5.0|The current finished season for this show, Season 7 of Bones finally shows how the relationship of Bones and Booth grows with the event of their child's development and growth. Solving crimes and revealing another mastermind criminal. Also showcasing new and more advanced technologies in science.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first book was great, the second just about what expected, to be kind of a bridge for a great ending. This final book though, I really had great expectations on a great ending but it feels as if the writer has been told, \\"Hey, you got 1 month to finish your 3rd book, because we want to publish it as soon as possible.\\" And the writer hasn't even started yet and rushed through it changing from a mild science fiction story to a very fictional story towards the ending.<br /><br />Of course you have to read it though, if you have already read the 1st and 2nd book you can't stop now. It isn't that bad either, is just that I was expecting a much better ending since the beginning(1st book) was great.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I am a middle school Teacher teaching Leadership and my sixth graders really enjoyed this movie.  It was really inspirational and teaches kids to reflect on who they are and be thankful about what they have.  In the film, Mary does an extraordinary job in encouraging her cousin to get off his chair and live life.  I highly recommend this movie to adults and kids alike.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I really enjoy Lee Child as a story teller. He is my favourite.  This one, for me, is a bit drawn out and a lot confusing.  Not as rivetting for me as his many other books.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great read from John Grisham.  Just what I've come to expect from John.<br />Highly recommend this book. If you enjoyed other Grisham books you will also like this one. 5*****
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is an excellent story. The story line gets better with every book and I cant wait to see what happens with the characters next. I am always wondering what is going to happen when the switch characters between the chapters it makes me want to keep reading to find out what happens to them.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|Oh my goodness, what an excellent book! It is a long time, if ever, since I enjoyed a book so much. Yes it is a detective story but not like one I have ever read before. For most of the book the murder seemed incidental to the story. And what a powerful story it was. So well written. The Isle of Lewis so wonderfully described. The past so important to explain what was happening in the present. Towards the end it all started to come together and you begin to understand why the previous 85% of the book was so important. Great book. First time I have read this author but won't be the last. I have already got book 2 in the trilogy downloaded and can't wait to get started.

B009HV2JT8|2.0|This is a super slick, loud & flashy film that started with an interesting premise.  Fortunately, the film succeeds for a certain demographic...about 13 to 18 years.  For anyone with an appreciation of the horror genre or more complex plot lines, this one doesn't make the mark. Wait until it's on one of the movie channels. One thing: the director did an execllent job with a lame screenplay. I hope he gets another chance or two with better scripts.
B00003CXB4|4.0|This should be a part of every classic Disney collection.  It has the best songs in the Disney classic movies and it's still great into my adult years.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I have ordred the Blue-Ray set so that I can have it to watch with my kids even if they take it off Netflix.  I like to support good art and good shows.  So my Blue-Ray purchase was well justified.<br /><br />This show is really great.  I love it.  I hardly ever watch TV at all, in fact my finding this show was just by accident.  I was clicking around on Netflix a few weeks ago and happened to just stumble on Serenity.  After watching Serenity, I realized that the movie was based on the Firefly series.  So decided to watch Firefly as well.<br /><br />I have to say this is one great show.  I put this show on the same level as Star Trek the original series.  Its that good and even better in many ways.  I like the grit and gunplay on the show.  As well as the sarcastic jokes and cursing in Mandarin.  Very creative and very very good!  (I always found Star Trek a bit too 'socialistic' with the one world government and multi world Federation for my tastes)

030759565X|5.0|First, a confession: Smitten Kitchen was the FIRST food blog I ever read and followed! I have loyally read every single post and have tried dozens of her recipes since that very first day. I've also purchased almost all of the cookbooks she has recommended (all three Baked books, Good to the Grain, Plenty, Sky High, and several others... I think this is a much healthier obsession than some), and love each and every one of them. But here's the thing: I've read all of her blog posts, and I figure she'll probably post the best of the recipes in her book eventually, so do I really need this particular cookbook? Also, notice that most of those cookbooks are grain or dessert-based... this is another reason that I hesitated to buy the SK book: I'm a vegetarian. I deeply love to cook, but I'm just not interested in a recipes that feature meat, so, if I'm going to purchase a cookbook with recipes for meat, I have to really, really want the other recipes in the book.  In the end, I purchased it out of loyalty - I wouldn't have found any of those other great cookbooks if it were not for SK!<br /><br />When it finally arrived, I was just as excited as I am opening any other new cookbook. I read every page, front to back (yep, even the meat recipes - I like the stories!), and tried a few of the recipes right away: Mushroom Bourguignon (although I have NO IDEA how to pronounce it, it was really yummy), Gooey Cinnamon Squares (OMG!), and Maple Granola (excellent, big clumps, but I did dial the sugar back).<br /><br />Everything was delicious, the recipes all worked (just like her blog recipes always work), and the stories and pictures were great. Maybe her personal tales wouldn't go over as well for someone who hasn't been following her blog, but for those of us who have, we kind of feel like part of the family, and we want to know what Alex and Jacob thought of the recipes, and how they changed them for the better!<br /><br />Anyway, long review short: if you are a regular follower of the SK blog, and are wondering if you really need to buy the cookbook, take the plunge! You won't regret it. If you haven't ever read the blog, I would suggest checking it out first. If you like her style of writing and her recipes, then you'll love the cookbook. It has earned its place among all the other great cookbooks that have come out on the last few years.

1435122968|1.0|I bought this some while ago now at barnes and noble.  with quite a few other lovecraft collections in my personal library i thought it'd be nice to have them all in one place.  it was also going to be nice to upgrade from the del ray editions which are riddled with spelling and context errors.<br /><br />and this edition is even worse off.  whoever edited this should be fired and never allowed to work in print ever again.  it wasn't just one or two mistakes that could be disregarded, almost every page contains errors.  some of them were relatively simple spelling errors - guilt instead of built.  some of them were coding errors - \\" instead of &Ouml;.  some of them make you reread sentences over and over again, wondering if this passed through the hands of some non-native english translator before it was finished.  if this were some work of non-fiction you might could just read past all this, but for me each one of them killed the atmosphere.<br /><br />don't waste your money on this edition, or if you do make sure to buy it in person after going over it at length to decide whether they fixed its many, many, many problems.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|If you've seen [[ASIN:B008DXMXPQ Searching For Sugar Man]], I don't need to tell you why you need to get this album. If you haven't, let me explain:<br /><br />In the 60's and early 70's, Rodriguez was a drifter playing gigs in Detroit. He was painfully shy, often sitting in the far corner of a bar with his back to the apathetic audience, singing to the wall. He was like [[ASIN:1439181594 the Fiddler in the Subway]], an immense talent whose music carried the soul and poetry of an inner-city Bob Dylan but who busy passersby and bar patrons rarely noticed.<br /><br />He was eventually noticed by a local producer from a small record label, with whom he released \\"Cold Fact.\\" It flopped badly, probably because the small label didn't have much promotional force and probably because the name \\"Rodriguez\\" is not exactly marketing gold. He was given another chance and released a second album (\\"Coming from Reality\\") the next year (1971), but it also flopped badly, leaving Rodriguez out of work. He spent most of the rest of his life doing hard labor around Detroit, and doing it with dignity and honor, wearing a suit to work every day and doing the dirty work that no one else would do. Acquaintances knew him as a gentle, unassuming eccentric, and his music career was forgotten as something from his youth. His music wasn't even in circulation in the U.S.<br /><br />So this extraordinary, 70-y-o man who spent most of his adult life as an inner-city laborer has been resurrected to popularity through a bizarre series of events documented in Searching for Sugar Man.<br /><br />42 years later, this music still holds up remarkably well, as so much music from the late 60's and early 70's does. To say that this album is worth buying would be a major understatement. There is a song that seems awfully out of place (\\"Only Good for Conversation\\") and there is a song that simply isn't very good (\\"I Wonder\\"), but on the whole, this is some of the greatest music to be produced by possibly the greatest music-producing city. \\"Crucify Your Mind\\" sounds like Bob Dylan at his most soulful moments, and \\"Sugar Man\\" sounds like King Crimson at theirs. But where this album reaches its most glorious heights is songs like \\"Hate Street Dialogue\\" and \\"Like Janis\\" and \\"Jane S. Piddy,\\" which deliver a soily poetry that is uniquely Detroit and uniquely Rodriguez, the type of music that we've been impoverished without.reatest music-producing city. \\"Crucify Your Mind\\" sounds like Bob Dylan at his most soulful moments, and \\"Sugar Man\\" sounds like King Crimson at theirs.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|Great thinking movie.  I is well worth seeing and watching over and over.  It ties in well with the Alien movies.  Add it to your collection, you won't be sorry.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Abolutely fabulous CD! Drake rocks this CD, believe me; he sounds incredible, the music is fabulous, and the lyrics relevant. I highly recommend this!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|As always, I have to say that the book is better but this movie had entertainment value. We've watched it twice and there are not many movies that I like to re-watch. It is violent of course and I still cried the second time.<br /><br />It is a movie that sets the stage for dialogue about our society, government, and shallowness. Any movie that can open up serious discussions between parents and teens is a-ok in my book.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a cleverly and masterfully told story, pulling back the curtain on many mostly unknown parts of the US prison and justice system.  Although fiction, John Grisham opens up a world most of us do not understand.  One of Grisham's best!

0385535147|5.0|I think the bar is set higher because it's Grisham.  Readers expect a clever plot with nuances and a message.  There usually is some social justice theme presented to the readers by his likeable characters.<br /><br />Instead, in this book, John Grisham moves the reader from a prison setting, to southern United States, Antigua and Jamaica.  Grisham does not have a pointed social justice missive, but he does bring home a good, solid page-turner narrated by an attorney who is wrongly sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Malcolm Bannister is African-American, a smart guy, who apparently was very naïve when he was indicted and found guilty of RICO violations along with his criminal client.  Grisham does pontificate about the wrong guys doing time.  There are many white-collar businessmen who are innocent and those who don't deserve long sentences.  That is probably Grisham's sole lecture.<br /><br />Malcolm's wife left him, he no longer sees his son and his father makes dutiful prison visits, which are rather heart breaking with disappointment.  Malcolm has served five years when the novel opens, and he is hell-bent on not spending another five.  He has created a rather bizarre plan to get out of prison, enter the Witness Protection Program and change his physical appearance when a federal judge and his secretary are brutally killed.  He convinces the Feds he knows who murdered Judge Fawcett and his secretary in the Judge's remote cabin. The complex storyline begins.  There are important secondary characters but Malcolm (who later becomes Max) drives the plot from beginning to end.  Is it believable?  No, not really, but Grisham held my attention and Bannister's complicated plan is always one step ahead of the reader.  This is pure fiction and for Malcolm to carry out his plan, all the details must fit into place.  Hardly plausible, but assuredly fun for the reader to enjoy conning government agents, identifying the real murderers and Grisham always manages to teach the reader new details.  For example, I never knew about Rule 35 and the lack of security for private jets in our country. Great escapism on many levels!eader new details.  For example, I never knew about Rule 35 and the lack of security for private jets in our country. Great escapism on many levels!

B0084AZXKK|5.0|I should have read \\"Treasure Island\\" long ago, but it was worth the +/- 60 year wait.  I loaded it onto my Kindle and read it when I had a few moments to spare.  I was pleasantly surprised how deeply immersed in the book I became.  I could almost smell the salt in the sea air.  The characters came to life.  This is a very well-written classic adventure story.  My only regret is that I hadn't read it sooner.

0385535147|3.0|If you like Grisham's stories, you will probably like this one.  It is a bit more disjointed than most of his stories, but at least it is not another preachy story against the death penalty.<br />Now, on to a bit of nitpicking.  I don't know much about the legal profession.  I care even less.  I don't know how accurate any of the legal aspects of the story are.  However, when the author hits something that I do know something about and conveys totally inaccurate information,  it leads me to suspect most of the other opinions/factoids quoted in the story.<br />In any event, the author discusses \\"the shady world of gold trading\\", like it is a big mystery.  The main character has to sell his gold for 20% less than it's actual value(called the spot price by normal people) because the gold is not registered to him.  Huh?  I have bought gold over the last several years(as have an increasing number of Americans after the dismal failure of Obamanomics).  The bars do have numbers on them, but they are not registered to the person who buys them.  This is just nonsense.  As for sales prices, dealers will sell gold for more than the spot price and buy at less than the spot price.  It's called making a profit.  This percentage differs from dealer to dealer.  Some of the fly by night operations will underpay by as much as 50% whereas more reasonable dealers are happy with a 2% profit margin.  Most deals are cash only.  There is no special deals with registered and unregistered gold.  Makes me wonder how many other issues Grisham plays fast and lose with.  I suspect there are a lot of them.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|the movie was excellent, and clear. It makes you want more, and more. the sound was like at the movies, and you want to sit down and watch the movie with pop corn. can't wait to watch something else. Like part 2
031603441X|5.0|Im on disc 10, out of 20.  I am mesmerized,  not only the story is fascinating, but the listening to Keith with his bright cockney tongue and strident intonations really brings a lot to his story. The audio starts w/ Johnny Depp reading and I think its around the 5th disc it breaks into Keith. I had not read the jacket so I did not expect it- but yes, reading it? Im sure its great, but really- \\"Fo get about it\\" ( as Keith loves to say), listen to Keith. I found it at the library. (:
0374214913|4.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is a great read for any bibliophile who also owns a Kindle. Clay Jannon's whimsical journey through not only the bookstore but his own life, tells a tale of the old-fashioned quest for knowledge coupled with new technologies.<br /><br />I read this as a hard-bound page turner, but at points I wished I had it on an e-reader just to see if there would be any technology surprises in a book that captured my imagination.<br /><br />Jannon says it best with \\"I realize that the books I love most are like open cities, with all sorts of ways to wander in.\\"

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book covered a very intellectual analysis from the author based on his medically technical experiences and overall life  story as an impartial and thought provoking view of his coma and out-of-body journey into the spiritual realm.  His accounting gave so much \\"Food for Thought\\" on the body's consciousness, spirit and soul and how it functions. Many who have related their near-death experiences were met with skepticism by medical professionals, and scientist who rely on facts versus unexplained spiritual encounters with little evidence to substantiate their occurrences. Proof of Heaven puts the author's account of his out-of-body experiences and contacts on a spiritual level as much more credible.
0985081821|5.0|How much I enjoyed the book: 10/10<br />How well I think it was written: 9/10<br /><br />The fantasy genre has become a host to an increasingly large number of novels with tired clichés, predictable characters and recycled plots. Yet, Rebecca Hamilton separates The Forever Girl from the rest: she thrusts the characters, their emotions and the world they live in firmly into an everlasting fragment of your heart.<br /><br />The story begins and ends with Sophia, who (to my absolute pleasure) is not only strong and independent but also perfectly imperfect. Sophia has clear flaws, such as her insecure nature, allowing the average reader to relate to her.<br /><br />I love the fact that Sophia doesn't mindlessly follow the instructions of others and isn't quick to trust strangers. It's something I've never understood with other writers - what kind of impression does blind faith in a stranger make on children/teenagers in this day and age? There have been too many real life horror stories circulating and too many impressionable people in the world for writers to continue to allow their characters to have this mentality. It's great that Sophia is also an educated adult - she went to University, got her degree and is of the appropriate age to make her own decisions. Another aspect I love about Sophia is that she didn't completely abandon her previous lifestyle for her new life. Instead, both she and Charles try to embrace the best of both by inviting Sophia's non-elemental friend (forgot her name) to visit. I can't tell you how much I despise teens that just run away from their lives to seek something new and dangerous and forget everything and everyone they've left!<br /><br />On the other hand of the spectrum - at no point did I feel fully invested in Charles' life as a single character without Sophia around. It's a shame because I always love to imagine what the male protagonist was like before he met the love of his life but the lack of attention and detail about his family prevented me from connecting with him as a character. In fact, I'm hoping for some more competition in Sophia's love life - a threat to the canon pair always helps the couple get that much closer! Speaking of which - the chapter on Ivory's memories held me captivated beyond any other. Not only was my mind blown by the sudden twist (that I wouldn't have expected even if it was dancing around in a Hello Kitty costume, playing music using a giant lollypop stick, with a line of bunnies following behind it) the very emotions Hamilton described had me needing to pause my reading after the chapter just to calm my mind and get my breathing back to normalcy.<br /><br />I can't even begin to tell you how desperately to see more of the supernatural world by the time I had finished reading. It both upset me and had me itching for more that we'd only been given a taste of the awesome. Most of the loose ends are tied in a neat bow but the lack of the supernatural world, plus a couple of other question marks prevent The Forever Girl from passing as a standalone book. Otherwise if you're a reader unlike me - who doesn't jump into the book and it's world and then suffer from the dreaded Book Hangover - you could read it alone and feel quite satisfied with the ending.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally had a break from work and decided after all the rave reviews I heard about the series I was going to read it, I was not disappointed!! I bought the book for my IPad yesterday and haven't put it down. I was a little hesitant to read the book for fear it was going to be gruesome (the premise of children killing each other isn't my cup of tea), but so little of the book actually focuses on the kill and the descriptions of the kills are not gruesome or disturbing at all. It is definitely not like Lord of the Flies, which is what I imagined it would be like. The main character is nothing short of wonderful and you can't help but want to jump right into the text and help her. Absolutely fantastic book!

0345803485|4.0|As my title states, I truly have no words. I'm pretty well read, I've traveled a lot. I've experienced a little bit of everything. I have never read anything as appalling and at the same time, as fantastic as this book.  The writing is awful. And by awful, I mean, curl-up-in-the-fetal-position-crying-for-your-mama AWFUL. I understand that this is fiction, but there is a way to write fiction without having the writer cringe in disgust.  ***SPOILER ALERT*** Our heroine, Ana never seems able to speak in a normal tone of voice. Is she that terrified of Christian that she's unable to communicate with him without whispering?  Christian is a self made billionaire? At age 26? For a person who has amassed that level of wealth, he has an incredible amount of free time. He literally never  works. Why is he always muttering to her? Why can't he just speak?  It is also incredible to me how he can just glance at her and she has an orgasm? Really? Is that really all it takes?  Also, can someone explain to me what exactly an \\"inner goddess\\" is? Ana's inner goddess makes an appearance every other page. She stares at Ana through spectacles, she reads books, she mocks Ana, she laughs with her. WHAT THE HECK? Is Ana secretly schizophrenic?  All in all, after all was said and done, i actually enjoyed this book. The writing was so terrible that it put a smile on my face more times than not. Christian was not a very likeable character, and Ana isn't either, but somehow or the other, i ended up pulling for them and hoping for things to work out.  I came across another writer, whose work took my breath away. Stella Gardner will be published by the end of November, 2012. I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy of her book, Love's Acquisition. it was amazing. Check out her facebook page.    [...]

B002ZG97RE|5.0|Chief Miller of the US Army is onto a plot involving bad intelligence. He has been lead on a wild goose chase tracking down WMDs in Iraq. He has the CIA and high ranking military intelligence officers breathing down his neck. He is on the verge of uncovering a major scheme that could change the course of the war. War is tough when even your allies turn on you.<br /><br />This movie is stacked. It's got great acting, suspense, mystery and drama. The screenplay, score, and cinematography are amazing. Green Zone is everything you would expect from a movie starring Matt Damon and Brendan Gleeson. If you haven't seen it you should definitely check it out.

B00005RYKU|3.0|Ruby and Rhett go to live with friends of the family after their parents die in a car crash. Note that I said crash instead of accident. After a strange string of events. Ruby discovers that the car \\"accident\\" may have been orchestrated. After she catches on her new parents pull the reigns in. The siblings lives may also be in danger. They have to decide between playing along or to break free.<br /><br />This movie is a remake so you can definitely say it has all been done before. Even so this movie is fairly entertaining. It isn't great though. The acting and the story are kinda so so. The saving grace of this movie is the suspense. This movie has some good suspense and the tension gets pretty high. If you add all the movies good and bad qualities together I think it ends up being just average. It's not a must see, but if you're bored and don't have anything else to do watching Glass House is better than sitting around and twiddling your thumbs.

B000NU2CY4|5.0|At the height of the Roman Empire Caesar is murdered by his jealous son. The General who was intended to succeed him is left for dead. Rome is now under the rule of a maniac. The former General is sold into slavery and is forced to become a Gladiator. He works his way to the coliseum and is soon the center of attention. He will use his power and fame to avenge the death of his murdered family. He will get his chance. He challenges Caesar himself to a duel and the outcome is legendary.<br /><br />This is probably one of the most famous movies in American cinematic history. It's got tons of action and plenty of drama. The acting and screenplay are both magnificent. This film is breathtaking in all aspects. I can't imagine there being a person out there who hasn't seen Gladiator. If by chance there is, that person needs to buy and watch this movie as soon as possible. It is an unforgettable experience.

B004XISI4A|4.0|While I am thoroughly enjoying this series, I am also a bit worried about it never ending as in some parts of this and the previous book not much happens!  The books are really long and the amount of people one has to keep track of only keeps on growing- for time poor people like me, re-reading them might not be an option, so I hope Mr Martin does have a clear path for the series!

B001QYKXB0|1.0|This is my introduction to APP. I don't recognise anything vaguely like prog-rock or concept album. Sure, the lyrics are all about the moral degradation of society, but that does not make for a concept album and this is hardly original subject matter. And as a collection of pop songs, neither does it work. It all sounds too much like low-grade Supertramp. Shrill vocals, predictable boring pop beats, nothing at all noteworthy in the musicality of the band... only diehard fans would make apology for this. As a newcomer I find this such a poor album that I doubt whether I want to hear any more of APP. IF you want 80s pop rather get the real stuff like Thompson Twins or Yazoo. Utter disappointment all round and I would give this 0 stars if the site would allow that, meaning that I rate it so poorly that I think it should never have been recorded.

B007TK77QE|5.0|Wow, just finished reading The Casual Vacancy.  There should be a warning that the contents can can make the reader think very deeply about the issues covered.  J K Rowling begins quite mildly letting the reader get to know the characters and the countryside in which they live, then I was hooked and could not put my kindle down.<br />I think it helps to understand the issues arising being english, having lived in a small, smug community for a few years but only a knowledge of tough, council estates from tv dramas and newspaper reports.  Be prepared to become emotionally involved, it is an incredibly moving and thoughtful book dealing with social deprivation, hypocracy and expectations dashed.  A fantastic read, worth all of 5 stars and more.  Congratulations Ms Rowling, more please.

The Ripley transition was much more believable.<br />The sets were interesting, but why the giant head and the canisters in the same room.<br />I have more questions than answers and I don't like applying my reasoning over something I consider incomplete.

B00979CS50|5.0|To say that Psychedelic Pill, Neil Young's first album of original material with Crazy Horse in a L-O-N-G time, has been \\"anxiously awaited\\" would be the understatement of the year. A couple of years ago, Ringo Starr was quoted in Rolling Stone, discussing the unpredictable nature of attending a Bob Dylan concert, saying that on any given night \\"You get the Bob that Bob wants to give you.\\" The same is true with Neil. There's every chance in the world that he might follow up this one with an album of Gregorian Chants, or maybe he'll put together an a capella boy band and Old Black will provide a wall of tuneless feedback in the background. Guess all you want, whatever you want him to do next, he probably ain't gonna do it. So when a Crazy Horse album lands it's an event, no matter what's on it.<br /><br />To their credit, Neil & The Horse have only released two albums that could be called \\"duds\\"...first, \\"Re*Ac*Tor\\" (which one critic of the day appropriately dubbed \\"re*pul*sive), issued at a time when he really didn't care about making music beyond fulfilling his contractual obligations, and \\"Life,\\" which lacked memorable tunes and was symptomatic of his entire rambling and aimless decade at Geffen Records.<br /><br />So...what kind of pill are we swallowing here?<br /><br />In 25 words or less, if you took \\"Ragged Glory,\\" \\"Sleeps With Angels\\" and \\"Broken Arrow\\" and slammed them together, you'd have Psychedelic Pill. The raging, redemptive jamming of Young's post-Geffen years that lit up most of the tracks on \\"Ragged Glory\\" can be found here in occasional bursts, as can the long, aimless, almost ambient jamming of Broken Arrow and the weird, David Lynch-ish punky, grungy, outsider views of \\"Sleeps With Angels.\\" What emerges is a new sound with echoes of all three, but anyone hoping for a replay of any one of those albums will be greatly disappointed.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Driftin' Back,\\" clocking in at 27 minutes, may test your patience. There's no real \\"climax\\" to the track, bringing the grossly misunderstood (in my opinion) \\"Broken Arrow\\" album to mind. Lyrically, it is easy to see why Neil and Lou Reed are often mentioned in the same sentence. These musings are private, in-joke goofs and word salads that might not even make sense to Neil himself, but every once in a while he throws in a pure enigmatic gem to keep us on our toes. To further advance the joke, the print in the lyric booklet is so small that it would make an ant ask for reading glasses. In \\"Driftin' Back,\\" following the repeated theme of \\"blockin' out my anger,\\" Young pleads \\"Excuse my religion, I used to be a Pagan.\\" In \\"Born In Ontario,\\" he effortlessly tosses off the single greatest lyric of the entire album: \\"I still like to sing a happy song, But once in a while when things go wrong, I pick up a pen and scribble on a page, and try to make sense of my inner rage.\\" Yes, boys and girls, he's still Neil Young, and he's still a genius.<br /><br />This is a five star album if you're willing to take Young on his own terms. Remember how he closed the \\"Broken Arrow\\" album with a poorly recorded, sloppily performed live version of Jimmy Reed's \\"Baby What You Want Me To Do?\\" That's the Neil who made this album, not \\"Harvest Neil.\\" He challenges you, he taunts you, he rocks you, he invites you along for the ride but really isn't interested in your feedback along the way.<br /><br />Do you miss the seemingly endless fade-outs tacked onto most of the tracks on \\"Weld?\\" Then \\"Walk Like A Giant\\" is for you. It's the third-longest song on the album at 16:30 (\\"Ramada Inn\\" beats it by 20 seconds). \\"I used to walk like a giant on the land, now I feel like a leaf floating in a stream\\"...to use the vocabulary of Neil's fan base, you can really smell the Horse on this one. He really gives Old Black a spanking here (and throws in some odd whistling to entertain or annoy, who knows). For all intents and purposes, the song is over at the 12 minute mark. The next four minutesare reminiscent of the KISS classic \\"Black Diamond\\" as increasingly sludgy one-note thuds from the band wither down into some \\"oooooohs,\\" followed by silence, and then it's over (except for the \\"Alternate Mix Bonus Track\\" version of \\"Psychedelic Pill,\\" which is a little crisper and less turgid than the original track). Thanks to Neil we know know it takes a giant approximately four minutes to make his exit.<br /><br />I've followed Neil's career since Buffalo Springfield, every single peak and valley and all points in between, so I don't know how a \\"first timer\\" would react to picking up this album. I see it as something he wanted to do, with the usual by-product being that it will delight some fans and disappoint others, but is it Horse-y enough to tide you over if he takes another decade before reuniting with Sampedro, Molina and Talbot? If you're a Neil Young fan, you're not supposed to ask that question, you just take 'em as they come.<br /><br />It's 85 minutes of music (88 if you include that \\"Alternate Mix), and the two-CD set sells for a single CD price. Stylistically, it's all over the place...just like Neil...there's no shortage of guitar solos and you will definitely know you are listening to Crazy Horse. The only way I could give it less than five stars would be if I hadn't been paying attention for the last 46 years.<br /><br />Buy it, and oh, before I forget...better not spook the horse.
B007ZFZI8C|5.0|This album is so emotional and true.<br />Very nice selection of theater/musical tracks which are very personal to Melanie C. I adore her as a woman of strength knowing that she is having a bit of ups and downs this year.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album.
B008OOYALE|5.0|just recently got this game and extremely enjoy it even if its a bit slow paced but thats a good thing when you a single parent
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I thought Patricia Cornwell had lost her mojo in her last Scarpetta novels which were ponderous and pedantic. This one was refreshing.
B004WR125O|4.0|This works as described and I would buy again. Importantly, if your router is set to require mac address identification, the mac address is NOT your router's mac address. Instead, temporarily disable your router's mac id requirement, then install the UWF-1. Your router should then list the correct mac address for your UWF-1. The usb does not list the mac address which makes identification difficult for those of us who require all mac addresses be \\"approved\\" by our routers. 4 stars due to this difficulty.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the books, though not a fan of the movie so if you've seen the movie, absolutely read the books, short easy little read but it will draw you in.
B009PU2KIQ|4.0|good album. has a lot of different musical tunes from rock to blues. blak and blue is a good album
B0018QQQK8|5.0|If you've seen the movie and weren't a fan or if you've seen the movie and absolutely love it, read the book! Nicholas Sparks is a great author and unfortunately they leave out generous parts when the make the movies.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander offers a view of consciousness after physical life that is complex and rich.  His account is in no way simplistic or formulaic yet is consistent in many ways with other teachings from various (mostly Eastern) traditions.  Parts of the book are so deeply resonant with what I have sensed in my heart of hearts, that it often brought me to tears of gratitude.  Thank you, Eben!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|For you reviewers like Mike Sehorn,,, don't tell the whole story when reviewing. Sehorn doesn't leave out much and lets you know way to much in a spoiling way.

B000056BOR|1.0|The recording quality of this dvd is so terrible it is unwatchable.  It is faded and the focus goes in and out so you feel queasy watching it.  The sound is even more horrible then I'd expected knowing it was recorded mono.  The whole feel of this recording is absolutely dreadfull as if a chimpanzee recorded it. Do Not Buy This!!  I'm not the only one who has commented on the horrible quality of this release.

B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I think that this is a smart twist to the original Sherlock homes. I really enjoy the interacts and discoveries you make along the way in each episode. It is smartly written and fun to watch. For those fans dedicated to the original a woman Watson and a tattooed Holms maybe to big of a jump of transition. All in all I like the show and look forward to continuing to watch.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its good,  some of the games are hard to get the points but overall its good.  wish that some of the gamed would be more helpfull
1595825045|5.0|This is probably the best Avatar related product I ever bought apart from the three seasons that comprise the series. The book details everything you would want to hear about especially if you are interested in \\"Behind the Scenes\\" things like I am. This book details pretty much the entire production process. It features how Bending was inspired, early character designs, story ideas, even how they came up with the hybrid animals. I love how the creators talk about each character, and every single episode is talked about in this book, even if they only take a page to talk about. This book impressed me beyond words. I loved each page, each drawing, some of the early work on Iroh looks really cool. If you are a fan of the animated series this will make a phenomenal addition to your collection of Avatar related memorabilia. It's a wonderful book and I plan to read it many more times. If I could put one criticism to this book it would be that there is no explanation of where Zuko's mom went but I can live with that until the next comic book comes out.
B0053O89XI|5.0|I love this DVD!  This has always been my favorite show!!  It is so funny and very well done!  I love it!
B007MB5OCE|1.0|I've read 60% of the book and am still trying to figure out the point of the story.  Rambles too much - can't get into it.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|ok I am completely addicted to this game and have been playing it for months. I love games like this and can sit and play it for hours. my only problem with the game is that I have beat it several times and although it has been updated several times with new puzzles it hasn't been updated in a while and I need my fix! ( hint hint! I need an update soon!)
B0047VSW30|1.0|Agora was the marketplace in Alexandria where religious debates took place.  Agora, the movie, is a fallacy.<br /><br />Alejandro Amenabar's portrayal of Christians as a hysterical, filthy, violent crowd of disheveled animals is not surprising since the overwhelming majority of film-makers and novel-writers are either atheists or leftists. His choice of Miss Weisz was a bad one: at the time the story takes place, Hypathia would be on her 50's. The main argument of the movie seems to be that Cyril (the Christian Patriarch of Alexandria) declared Hypatia to be a witch, therefore inciting Christian zealots to murder her. She is portrayed desperately gathering scrolls from the library before the hysterical Christian mob can get to it, and nobly dies, defending reason and science against the ignoramus Christians! Yes, Cyril's uncle (Theophilus) destroyed pagan statues in the pagan temple area of Alexandria, but it was Julius Caesar who it seems accidentally burned down the library. Some sources believe Muslim conquerors in the seventh century A.D. are the responsible party. Accounts of that day, both Christian and pagan, so much as hint at the destruction of any large collection of books. Not even the pagan Eunapius of Sardis (who despised Christians) ever suggested such a thing happened. And pagan historian Ammianus Marcellinus, describing the Serapeum not long before its demolition, spoke of its libraries as no longer in existence.<br /><br />Amenabar's film has an arresting resemblance to Carl Sagan's TV program \\"Cosmos\\" (\\"The Mysterious Fate of the Great Library of Alexandria\\"), where Hypatia is shown as a scientist and philosopher who became a victim of the wicked Cyril. According to Sagan \\"the supreme tragedy was that when the Christians came to burn down the great library of Alexandria, there was no one to stop them.\\" Sagan based his account upon Edward Gibbon's anti-Christian \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\\" Gibbon (who misread a sentence from the Christian historian Orosius) was the first to link Hypatia's murder with the burning of the Alexandrian library. Yet, there is no evidence connecting Hypatia to any library in Alexandria at all. The Sarapeum was sacked by angry Christians in her time, as a result to pagan defilements of Christian houses of worship.<br /><br />In Socrates Scholasticus' Historia Ecclesiastica there is an interesting description of the destruction of the Serapeum temple complex: \\"The pagans of Alexandria, and especially the professors of philosophy, were unable to repress their rage at this exposure, and exceeded in revengeful ferocity their outrages on a former occasion: for with one accord, at a preconcerted signal, they rushed impetuously upon the Christians, and murdered every one they could lay hands on. The Christians also made an attempt to resist the assailants, and so the mischief was the more augmented. This desperate affray was prolonged until satiety of bloodshed put an end to it. Then it was discovered that very few of the heathens had been killed, but a great number of Christians; while the number of wounded on each side was almost innumerable.\\"  It seems Hypatia was caught in the struggle between Orestes (the civil authority) and Cyril (the bishop), and was killed in retaliation for the murder of some of Cyril's supporters by agents of Orestes (it seems by the \\"parabalani,\\" a fraternity originally founded to care for Alexandria's poor).<br /><br />The film portrays Hypatia as an astronomer (clearly in order to draw comparison with Galileo), but she was best known as a follower of Plato and Plotinus. There were Christians in Hypatia's classes, Christian bishops among her circle of friends, Christian theologians--like Augustine, Ambrose, and Origen--enthusiastic advocates of neo-Platonism. (One of her most ardent students, Bishop Synesius, wrote several letters to her, calling her \\"mother, sister, teacher, and withal benefactress, and whatsoever is honored in name and deed.\\")So her portrayal as the noble champion of reason against a bunch of disheveled half-crazed Christian is more than ridiculous: it is insidious! (Incidentally, she was not the inventor of either the astrolabe or the hydrometer. The hydrometer was mentioned in a letter to her by her friend Synesius of Cyrene, where he explained how the device was made, so she could arrange to have one built for him!)<br /><br />But Mr. Amenabar's tricks are also aesthetic. In one scene the camera is on a high point of vantage overlooking the Alexandria library while vandalized by the Christian mob: it is clearly intentional that it makes the Christians look like cockroaches. (Incidentally, and according to historical records, the Jews also took part in the fighting that often occurred among the religious factions in Alexandria.) Another even more perverse scene shows a group of scruffy Christians carting away bodies of Jews they had just killed, a clear parallel to the bodies of the Jews seen in photographs of concentration camps. Had Mel Gibson made a movie depicting muslims the way this movie depicts Christians, he would not have long to live! Yes, Cyril was a harsh ruler; he did expel the Jews from Alexandria against the wishes of Orestes; but there is no concrete evidence that he led a murderous crusade against the Jews nor that he had a role in the murder of Hypatia. It seems her murder was instigated by Peter, a minor layman in Cyril's church. Apparently, Peter and his followers believed Hypatia was somehow preventing Orestes and Cyril's reconciling. And Socratis Scholasticus condemns the deed: \\"This affair brought not the least opprobrium, not only upon Cyril, but also upon the whole Alexandrian church. And surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort.\\" (It reminds me of a certain religion that actually encourages \\"massacres\\"!) Finally, the movie portrays Christians as being opposed to scientific investigations, as if only atheists--or pagans--honored science!<br /><br />To the ones who believe this is an accurate portrayal of that time, here is an article with an in-depth study of the movie's inaccuracies, based on historical material: [...]. And if you are interested in History, I suggest you read \\"A History of Christianity\\" by respected historian Paul Johnson, and David B. Hart's \\"Atheist Delusions\\"--because the real story of Hypatia will never, ever be made into a movie!ampion of reason against a bunch of disheveled half-crazed Christian is more than ridiculous: it is insidious!
