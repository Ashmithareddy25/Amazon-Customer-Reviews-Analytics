B004SRPXWQ|3.0|it is designed very well and also has good graphics. I am sure my grandchildren will like it when they come to visit.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This is one of the best search and find games I have found. The graphics are awesome...so much detail in every seen. Since I downloaded this game it's been my &ldquo;go to game&quot; to relax and escape. The story line is great and keeps me guessing. The main difference between this game and others is that it's just the right level of difficulty...a game that actually makes u think lol . Keep up the stellar work. Thanks.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|WOW. I absolutely love John Greens writing! And his ability to write in a teenage girl's POV? Impressive! I was laughing so much through out this book at Hazel and Augustus humor. This book will definitely make you laugh....and cry! But it is one that I could pick up and read over and over again. Great work.<br /><br />\\"We are literally in the heart of Jesus,\\" he said. \\"I thought we were in a church basement, but we are literally in the heart of Jesus.\\"<br />\\"Someone should tell Jesus,\\" I said. \\"I mean, it's gotta be dangerous, storing children with cancer in your heart.\\"<br />\\"I would tell Him myself,\\" Augustus said, \\"but unfortunately I am literally stuck inside of His heart, so He won't be able to hear me.\\"
B00BBW16HW|5.0|No wonder \\"poignant\\" is a french word. There's very little I can add to what other reviewers haven't already said. I'm usually a movie skeptic; I dislike mushy cliches and predictability, but in all honesty, this film's story and dialogue was original enough (truth, or a dramatized version of it, will always be stranger than fiction) to surpass all the turnoffs. It definitely is \\"feel good\\", but not too corny and exaggerated.I think the strength of this film is its ability to deliver poignancy in a witty, un-PC and unapologetic way. I can totally imagine the movie bombing or diminished to some formulaic Hollywood tripe in less capable hands.<br /><br />SPOILERS: One thing that kinda bothered me is how he often crossed the boundary of what's acceptable into misdemeanors (like theft, shoving, and aggressive flirting, which could be construed as sexual harassment). I find it hard to believe no one pushed back on him or gave him some stern warnings or threaten to terminate him....but maybe his personality won him over. Or maybe they left those parts out of the screenplay.<br /><br />All in all great film, fantastic score and cinematography, superb dialogue and acting, it's another addition to my list of favorites.
1881273377|5.0|Everyone should read this book (or at least listen to it). I have listened to it a few times and have given a few copies as gifts.<br />It has really helped me to better understand different perspectives and given me great ideas on how to improve my most important relationships. There are several versions. The one for children is great too.
B006RJTKYU|5.0|One of my favorite films, this wonderful precursor to &#34;Rosemary's Baby&#34; is that rare mix of atmospheric horror with dark humor that actually works.  Owing greatly to German Expressionism, Polanski hits all the right notes- and the only time he has acted with his lovely wife Sharon Tate (that I'm aware of).  Highly recommended.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Every episode brings new light to characters in an engaging way. Each character is a brilliant balance of vices and mistakes and admiral qualities and choices. I can't wait to watch the third season.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Who'd think a dark prison movie would be so wonderful?  Clearly, one of the best films ever made.  Superbly acted. Fine script.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly sounds like it just shouldn't work--cowboy pirates...in space!--but it is so delightful that I've seen the whole series through like 5 times now. Easily one of my favorite shows ever. Shouldn't have been cancelled, blah blah blah. I am not ashamed to say that there was a time in my teenage years when my entire DVD collection consisted of Finding Nemo and Firefly.
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|Another of my favorite science fiction movies.  This had a good image quality on the DVD.  I watch it often.
1600597963|5.0|I loved everything about this book!  Bead embroidery is new to me and this book made sense to me.  I have collected a lot of fun stuff, now to get started!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, and you also have to think to figure out some of the puzzles. Very cute!
0525478817|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and fell in love with the smart and sarcastic characters that were brought to life in it. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Heavy material, but the story and characters are just so engaging. Loved it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|One I play'd this game it was cool and awesome I love it when I play'd this game it was just like minecraft and I love minecraft
B003O86FMW|4.0|Although I didn't read the first or the last book of the Hunger Games, therefore missing some of the background, I found<br />&#34;Catching Fire&#34; to be a fierce rendering of the human mind. Suzanne Collins' story tells about difficult and important decisions, and their life or death consequences. Her characters are well drawn, her scenes are truly unique, and her good vs. evil makes the reader feel hopeless and hopeful all at the same time. Reading the beginning in the first book, and the outcome in book three of the Hunger Games is a must for me.<br /><br />Bettyann Vakauza
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! Just make sure you have some memory space or it will lag,  but of you get it working it's AWESOME!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Been a fan of the Hulk since I was a little kid (quite a while). Lots of interpretations of the Hulk, some decent, most completely wrong. Finally someone nails it. An absolutely unstoppable force who wreaks devastation with every step.<br /><br />Story is great, acting is good and the effects are terrific. I loved it from the first minute to the last.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|The whole premise of the book is simple: people are not who you think they are.  The one person you are positive you hate in the beginning is the person you see as the ultimate victim in the end.  Reichs does a masterful job of changing your opinion in an intriguing story.
B008N1LL42|4.0|Straight forward plot, no major acting skills required, bad guys, good guys and the Mighty Mo, what else do you need?
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Awesome movie definitely ahead of its time I think for an old movie. I wish it could have been longer but the ending just makes you think what would happen next witch is cool. Can we get a sequel ha ha.
1594203334|1.0|The whole notion of French parenting wisdom collapsed when the author revealed how unpopular breastfeeding is in France. I did a bit of additional research and it seems that statistically France has one of the lowest rates of mothers who breastfeed on the globe. At this point I began to consider that maybe making kids cry through the night at 4 months of age was not wise but selfish. I began to consider that cheerios not ending up in Lous Vuitton bags was just as it seemed - selfish! It is one thing to not be able to breastfeed because of the lack of a maternity leave or some other impediment but not to do it when you have available resources ( as I am sure many of her privileged French mothers do) and choose not to because it isn't en vogue, well, that's just selfish.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know it is the first version, like it just came out but, wool but no Redstone? Dued, why would I play? I do, it's just not that fun. Maybe if the update comes out it will be better. Don't buy it until then unless you just like creative...
B00CDT41RY|3.0|But I realize I should have known to expect it from Tarantino.  Jamie Foxx played a tortuous role like the winner he is: outstanding!<br /><br />If movie ended at the dining room scene it would have been fabulous.
B008RXYOKY|2.0|I do a lot of video editing and have three FireWire external drives that I use for scratch disks and file storage. I can connect them one at a time via the Thunderbolt adapter, but if I try to daisy chain two of them, my iMac disconnects from both drives. So, yeah, it lets me use a FireWire hard drive, but I can't move files between them. I have to copy them to my iMac and then over to the other disk, doubling the amount of time it takes to transfer files. When you're talking about many gigabytes of video files, that's a lot of wasted time. Apple claims FireWire devices plugged into the Thunderbolt adapter can be daisy chained, but I can't get it to happen. Maybe I'll just buy a second adapter; I have two Thunderbolt ports and the other one is just sitting there not doing anything. I shouldn't have to work around \\"improved\\" technology, though.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Wonderful portrait of an unlikely relationship deftly tossing balance of power back and forth to show a true loving friendship that transcends race and economic position.<br /><br />Two terrific acting jobs.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Best movie ever!!! My mom is in a wheelchair and this movie shows that even though a person has lost functionality in their limbs,they still have thoughts , feelings and can enjoy life.
0061692034|5.0|From the stunning opening lines of this heart wrenching novel to the final moments of violence and moralistic conclusions (often reminiscent of American Transcendentalism), Richard Ford's Canada is a tremendous literary accomplishment. On one level, this is the story of a brother and sister whose lives are thrown into violent disrepair--and yet on another level it is a profoundly quiet and wonderful book about what it means to live on the margins, invisibly and without direction. Ford masterfully weaves two narrative voices to tell his story: we are given the immediate observations of the protagonist as an adolescent, and we are also given the narrator's more mature observations from a later moment in time (parenthetically placed). And then there are simply haunting moments of natural beauty and terror--I'm thinking of the Dell's drive with Charley that first night into Canada and the way he focuses in on an owl that flies before the headlights, terrifyingly. Such moments evoke the infinite power and danger of the natural world--important reminders for the often feeble characters who seek to insert themselves against the rule of nature. Canada is many things, but it is indisputably gripping. It is an American classic ready to be loved and canonized.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I am a devoted fan individually to Jon Schmidt as well as Steven Sharp Nelson, and having them collaborate together as the PianoGuys has made me happy! I love their classical twists on modern music. This CD makes you feel good. I bought a copy for myself when the CD first came out and recently for my mom and mother-in-law for Mother's Day. They were so happy to have it! Definitely happy with this CD and would recommend it to anyone.<br />One last thing, it comes with the 'Auto Rip' feature from Amazon, so I was able to download this music from the Amazon MP3 player to my Kindle Fire Cloud. Now I can have great music with me everywhere I go!
8484416895|3.0|I love this autor, and this story is good but maybe is for my experience that I expected more about the book..
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones is always good. Some of the other acting was questionable and the story just dragged a bit. Not bad but not great.
B000002O4X|5.0|I have seen the movie so many times and have admired the music so much, this is wonderful!<br />Glad that I made the purchase!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Second time I have read this book.  Well written and I like to read non fiction.  Plus the fact I well remember WW2  so  I guess I like stories of our  protectors. Recent  new from Texas  prompted me to read again.
B000088E6D|5.0|I enjoy Michael Buble, love the selection of old songs.  He sounds so much like Frank Sinatra, especially on this CD.<br />This is a great buy if you like the old songs and Michael.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|The game play is great but  you need someway to get back your health in the run and there needs to be an steadfastly dogs the missiles. Put a power up where we can always know where the missiles will hit.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Big, big disappointment are the only words I can find to describe the experience of finally being able to read Gone Girl. The first third of the book was really bad. I had to force myself through it. And now I understand why I keep running into people who say they simply gave up shortly after beginning and moved on to another read. The middle third was better, but the last third was another let down repeatedly putting me to sleep as I forced myself to finish. Based on my experience,  I totally understand the 2000 1 and 2 star Amazon ratings and strongly suggest if you don't like it after the first 50-100 pages give up and move along to something else because it doesn't really get any better.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Nowhere near a best picture of any year.  It's a reminder that whatever is playing at the end of the year gets excessive attention and buries better pictures in oscar hype.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Usually an album has one or two songs that I like, but Amaryllis surprised me :) I actually enjoyed every song!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've owned a few gaming mice over the years, and I game like mad. I had a couple of other mice, one a ancient MX700 cordless which I used up until a couple of weeks ago and another mouse I ordered but is way too small for most, the MX300 gaming mouse. I felt I needed to check on what's out there and saw this. Read the reviews and its features and ordered it. AM I GLAD I DID! This is by far the best mouse all around I have owned to date that fits the bill with exceptional quality and precision, and all its many features.<br />Very, very nice looking mouse. The fit to ones hands should be about right for anybody. it is large enough ( not a small mouse at all ) but I have only medium hands in scope and it fits well for me. Even larger hands this mouse would be perfect for as well I suspect. The control panel software is just a nice piece of work that has all ones needs and it operates with ease. Clicking any feature is instant with no delay, meaning it is a smooth operation for changing up any feature.<br /><br />The color panel is very nice and has a wide range of hues with each color one wants. 32 in all. Unfortunately, only the \\"Anker' emblem logo lights up for color change. DPI light setting is blue.<br />The added weights provided will be an asset for many who need a heavier mouse. I am using about 3 myself to try it out. Nice! The click nice and easy, and anything else works great for gaming. IMO, a steal at just $40.00. Buy this mouse. You will be very impressed and glad you did.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandson has this at home and begged me for it. I thought the price was quite high for this kind of game but I got it for him. He loves it and everytime he comes over this game is all he wants to do. He is 9 years old.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|Compelling account of how the then powerful nations in Europe unthinkingly fell into the &#34;Great War.&#34;  His evidence displaces the &#34;it's all Germany's and Austria's fault&#34; for the War.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I've missed hearing good music during these pop filled days.  Always nervous when a group seems to disappear and then makes a comeback.  However, this entire album is fantastic and what I think of as FOB.  Will admit that hearing Elton John on Save Rock and Roll was a bit perplexing.  If you're a fan of FOB and how they've grown over their albums, you should definitely buy this!
B00A2JTEHY|5.0|Great news! The \\"mistake\\" in the PARSIFAL recording (splicing in a different recording with a different cast for the beginning of Act 1) has been corrected for this boxed edition. I'm listening to it right now. It's Hans Hotter and Elisabeth Hongen from the very beginning. I know what the reviewer is talking about though - I listened to an earlier edition of this performance that did splice in a performance with Martha Modl at the beginning. But believe me, I KNOW Modl and Hotter's voices like the back of my hand - and this edition is completely authentic from 1961 Vienna State Opera. Sound is in solid, clear mono as well. This is a great box set - lots of fun with a big spectrum of different performances/artists!
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|This is apparently a version of the board game Blokus. Having not known that and never played it, I appreciated the fact that it was not difficult to grasp or integrate myself in the game by way of the help menu. That was gold. Otherwise, this is an easy and fun game to play when you have those sparse moments of time in your day. It is not difficult at all to get a hang of the structure of this game due to a useful help menu, great graphics and smooth controls. A great added feature would be multiplayer capability.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|Love it. Does every video format that I throw at it. The network part is clunky but I got past it.
B004TI1WME|4.0|This calculator has a lot of the functions that I would need or want. It is an exceptional calculator, especially when you are dealing with percentages, memory buttons, etc. It essentially is a great calculator at such a modest cost.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Using an Amazon Kindle HD tablet. Sure beats lugging around a laptop. My Main use is tracking my mileage and time at work in a custom spreadsheet I use. Works P-E-R-F-E-C-T-L-Y ! and was worth every penny.
B00821OX98|4.0|Liked it and we know scifi shows don't last long anymore so hopefully this one stays around for a while
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Gives you in Windows based PC everything you want. I have it installed on all Android gadgets and it works perfectly all the time. Work fine on my IPad, too.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|This is my no means as good ad the first one.  If you haven't seen either of the footloose movies, skip this one and watch the original.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I have this installed on an IPad 3 and a Amazon Kindle. Works perfectly once you set up the host PC.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This was an okay game.  It had a few puzzles but they were very easy.  There are a lot of HO segments if that's what you like, but don't count on zooming much.  The story was just okay.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I think it's awesome that amazon now gives us 5 gb of free storage. Now I don't need to use some other source for my photos and I don't have to worry about having enough space on my kindle fire.
0439023521|5.0|It is rare that a book with the relentless pace of this one can hold my interest. Ironically, it's usually the quiet, emotional moments that keep me turning pages, rather than than the fast paced action people are generally referring to when they call a book a 'page-turner'. Despite my usual tastes, I think I ended up loving this book so much not because the action scenes were just that well-written, but because the narrative never loses sight of the emotional stakes for Katniss. Often in such books, if a character is in a life-or-death situation, the author doesn't feel the need to show you why these events matter--its just taken for granted that of course the character doesn't want to die, doesn't want their loved ones to die. And though survival is at the center of this novel, the emotional stakes are always high as well. Plus the emotional landscape is varied--often writers will attempt to do what I just described by picking one person the protagonist cares for, and repeatedly throwing in lines about how much they love them. This would have been easy to do with Katniss's sister, but her love for Prim is shown through Katniss' actions, rather than limited only to throwaway lines. And there are many other people she cares about, in different ways. This is all conveyed expertly despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that the narrative is mostly action, not dialogue, description, or internal monologue.<br /><br />I won't describe the plot because I think everyone knows that. I just to encourage people who don't generally like action/adventure type stories to read this book, because it is so much more than just a thrilling and suspenseful story. But it is that, too, so action fans will enjoy it as well.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Great game if you're trying to get your brain working. Games like this are useful for stress reliever--as long as you don't get stuck on a level.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It's okay haven't really used it much<br />We down loaded for back up when we are unable to<br />Use our phones
B007PT1PEY|5.0|For my boyhood hero, a dollar is of no monument to me. I'd already owned the free classics but I figured they may not be up to date so I bought these. Just saying, this will help to keep the Sherlock Holmes story in line. I couldn't figure out which one came first before.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes is one of the reasons I would like to be involved in crime fighting/solving as a career. If you haven't read about him, I strongly recommend that you do. He's one-of-a-kind.
B009K86D86|5.0|Great movie<br />Real eye opener<br />A must see for everyone<br />Stop being a fast foods nation!<br />Eat more produce, eat wholesome<br />Support your local farmer
B009NY43NY|1.0|The last few books were hard to slog through, so this one isn't that surprising. I just kept skimming through the boring parts to get the basic story for the last 3 books. I really enjoyed the earlier books. They had intrigue and life. I suppose this is why authors shouldn't sign contracts to make a certain number of books for a series. She was bored with this a few books ago. At least the long, drawn out death of the series is done.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I also have this game on my Kindle so I can chose between this and Freecell to pass the time while waiting at the doctors office or wherever.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a great game.<br />Really fun to play.<br /> Can't wait until the next one comes out..liked the haunting music too.
B0097K21YW|3.0|I got this app when it was offered as the \\"Free App of the Day\\" because it looked kinda fun.  Kind of like a cross between \\"Angry Birds\\" and \\"Rampage.\\"  It was fun for about the first 15 minutes but then it got way too repetitive and I quickly became bored with it.<br /><br />I love \\"Angry Birds\\" and could play those games for hours.  This one, however, I can't.  It's just not as good.  Worth 99 cents, maybe, but that's it.
B005HE5J7I|3.0|Perhaps because the scope of this history novel is so broad, it really reads more as history than as fiction.  The strategy that worked so well in Sarum, where the history is presented through five or six families and their descendants, the six or so families of London have their histories divvied up into such brief episodes that I never felt that 'caught up' personal identification with a character that good fiction must provide.  I enjoyed the 'cameo appearances' of all the well-known historical personages from Julius Caesar on up to Churchill, but found no central focus that carried me through, unless it was was just the interest of recognizing the fact that London was a greater melting pot than nearly any other city, ever.  And by the way, the maps and the family trees are mostly unreadable on a Kindle 2.  Maybe everyone who reads the Kindle version should buy a Kindle Fire or find another book to read.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|After trying 22L's \\"Abby Monkey\\" app I decided to also get their \\"Alphabet Aquarium.\\"  This one focuses primarily on alphabet recognition, which is exactly what my kindergartner is learning right now.  Every day when he gets home from school, he always has some homework to do that focuses on letter recognition and how to write his ABC's.  Once he is finished, I let him use this app as further reinforcement for what he has already done in school.  Not surprisingly, he enjoys playing with the app a lot more than doing his homework.<br /><br />I should also point out that the app does have some fun games on it as well.  The \\"Build The Animal\\" game even caught the attention of my 8 year old daughter, who then started shouting \\"Let me play!\\" when she saw it.<br /><br />Highly recommended to parents.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I loved this movie.  It is like Rocky for Robots, I mean this is really a great movie.  There is a bit of cursing in the movie but it doesn't go overboard but if you have kids and you are sensitive to that sorta thing, please be aware of that.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|love this series!!<br />I can not wait for season 3! So glad my husband happened to watch the first episode we are both hooked!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Cool extra features showing the making of the movie and the story behind it. Christopher Nolan is a genius and a master in story telling, definitely worth the money!!
0670827592|5.0|Great book for 4 year olds and older. My 3 year old doesn't get it, but the 4 year old does and loves it. It a good book to show different perspectives on things and its one of my favorite kids books :)
B002GYI9C4|4.0|The start was fairly boring and the writing style was a bit grating. I couldn't stand the number of times the author repeated certain phrases and platitudes, but they died down and were eclipsed byt the growing storyline.  The magic system initially irritated me, but as it expanded and took shape it defnitely improved.  Glad i didn't give up early on this one!
B0064QNS62|5.0|now I can take this with me where ever I go...I recommend this for anyone who has a kindle and not just for reading.
082300659X|3.0|I expected something else from this book, but on the overall it is not as comprehensive in terms of methodology. It has a feel of a history book (at least to me). The illustrations are very good and it made reading easy, much like that of a novel in some ways. Many pages are devoted to finished works by many artists including herself, (which is OK) but a beginner like my daughter felt left out. A more systematic and detailed book like \\"The Big Book of Drawing\\" by Andras Szunyoghy for a similar price (see my review there) was significantly superior and I am using that to teach her drawing. The author herself appears to be a very good artist/painter, but as an art \\"how to\\" book this felt incomplete. I gave it 3 stars for the readability, paper quality and the few illustrative examples that were presented.

0446572985|5.0|Is there such a thing as a \\"good assassin\\"?  Loved the character, Will Robbie, and his quick-thinking actions involving a spunky and clever 14-year old girl.  Who are the targets?  He'll figure it out to his surprise!  (I did figure out a \\"too good to be true\\" person early, but that didn't take away from enjoying the end result).  Am anxious to read THE HIT now after enjoying this Will Robbie character!  Great writing!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Very good but wheel guys are overpowered they can't move back from my wind attack and they are hard as a rock to kill but besides those it very good and fun I love raiding but not much on. The timer is a bit short but you should get it
0374533571|4.0|What a thoroughly puzzling novel! The Silver Linings Playbook by Matthew Quick was not at all what I was expecting. I did not watch the movie... thought I'd read the novel first. I adore Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, so I really thought I'd dig the novel.<br /><br />It's about Pat Peoples, a recent patient of \\"the bad place\\" which is how Pat refers to the mental home he lived in for the past 4 years. He has completely blocked out the memories of what led to his being sent to \\"the bad place\\", but he is finally released and allowed to move home to his parents house in New Jersey.<br /><br />Working on his familial relationships, he ends up meeting his brother Ronnie's daughter Emily [whom he has never met before] and wife, Veronica, as well as Veronica's sister Tiffany. Tiffany is a recent widow around Pat's age and Ronnie tries to set them up. Pat is only interested in friendship, as he believes he is still married to Nikki.<br /><br />The friendship between Pat and Tiffany is such an odd centerpoint. They are extremely flawed and struggling to survive their own realities. This definitely made for interesting reading and I loved the story, especially when I got about halfway through the novel. The beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through, but the pay off at the end was worth it!<br /><br />-Sarah<br />http://nobodyputssarahinthecorner.com

B0076DELIG|5.0|The characters are developed so well you felt you could see them.  The same was true for the locations used in the story.<br />You are kept at the edge of the life of the detectives as their minds process the fragments of facts the lead you to a very different<br />and surprising conclusion.  In the end you feel you were with them through dealing with all of the personalities and arriving at the conclusion.  They were fighting city politics all the way.

B00AMBK6J2|1.0|I would not waste my time watching this movie. It was not entertaining nor was it funny. And I love teddy bears but NOT Ted!!
B008YKRRIQ|5.0|I have been purchasing several of the boxes devoted to Otto Klemperer.  I found this one of the best.  Schubert's No. 8 the Unfinished is a favorite of mine, having about 7 different versions in my collection.  This is certainly one of the best I have ever heard.  And the sound as usual is stunning.  There are eight other romantic symphonies in the box along with  some overtures such as the New World, Franck Symphony, Tchaikovsky and Berlioz.  I realize that some of you may already  have versions of these various works but I must say there is not a weak performance in the box.  If you happen to like the romantic period in music, you will really love every work in this box.  As usual, you can purchase it for a small price at good Amazon.  No, I am not paid by Amazon or anybody else for that matter/ I am simply stating my true opinion.
0930289528|4.0|I enjoyed reading this graphic novel. I read The Watchmen before checking this one out. It was a solid story, and it moved quickly. It's an intelligently written comic that has something to say about tyranny and how easily our freedoms can be encroached upon. I enjoyed the message and agree with it fully. In some ways I feel like the message interfered with simply telling a cool story, but I guess you can't have it all. Overall I would say it is well worth checking out.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Just ok but right from the beginning you knew they were getting together.  Just was ok was looking for more.  I ate at the restaruant this took place.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|Inexpensively produced, with a shallow storyline, but enjoyable to watch if you enjoy si-fi and have some spare time. Easier to follow, if you begin with Season 1 and follow through.  People must like Doctor Who, cause its been around for quite a while.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I own the kindle fire and it is awesome!!! Me and my son both share this device. I can set a time limit on my kindle,  for my son to play and watch videos. THIS THING IS AWESOME! !
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The acting is great-- no weak links.  There is ongoing drama throughout the series, yet each episode can be viewed alone and make sense as a courtroom drama.  The series is best viewed in sequence to get the continuing story and character history.  One thing that was particularly refreshing is that the main character, Alicia, is believable.  She has lines in her face, as most women do at her age, and has a real body.  She is slender but not model slender.  She is attractive but not perfect.  I love her clothes, perfect for the part and they suit her.  You will see her wear the same suit again in the series, much as it would be in any woman's wardrobe.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game, nice stress reliever, awesome graphics, game just goes on and on.  addictive and the birds are a hoot.
0743270754|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and missed it after I finished it. I read some of it every day and really liked looking in on<br />&#34;What was happening to the Lincolns tonight&#34;---even though we all know how it ends, getting to know Lincoln and all those around him was a fresh, new experience. I have always admired Lincoln as the leader he was, but had no idea how deeply he would move me as a man. I recommend this book to everyone!! We certainly do not have his equal in our times.
B008VBYN80|2.0|Don't really care for this game, seems too elementary and quite boring.  Recommend this game for children under 6<br />Years old
B006O2QNOU|4.0|This was a fun to watch, interesting lifestyle.  The plot was a bit thin and a tad depressing.  Kevin Spacey was excellent.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|While Brandon Sanderson has done much to revive the series, the greatest novels lie in its early past. And while it's great for Al Thor to walk away with afresh start, it is also extremely unbelievable. A man is defined by his past much more than by a new body, and youthful innocence cannot be bought that easily.<br />I guess the ending had been preordained by Robert Jordan, who at the time probably had little idea how large his series would get, and how many strings would have to be unravelled at the end and carefully spliced together. I doubt a project of this magnitude could be solved smoothly, except if the end had been prepared much earlier instead of having countless filler novels that barely advanced the tale. I am talking about the several immediately prior to Sanderson's involvement. The Seanchan are an awkward addition throughout the narrative, implausible and, hence, lifeless. So are actually many of the other outlying cultures, Taraboners foremost on my mind here.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Again, I love the Jesse Stone series and the Robert B. Parker books which inspired the series. I look forward to watching the rest of the series again.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I had never considered life in North Korea and what it could be, especially for a prisoner and especially for life in such a prison camp. An amazing story.
B000001FT2|5.0|I think that this is perhaps the ESSENTIAL CD for any music collection! Grace was at the top of her game and at the height of her popularity, and this set of songs captures her at her best. While Grace never did have a 'pretty' voice, and some of her music is a bit 'off' sounding, this CD was produced to perfection, and Grace never sounded better. Seeing her on Johnny Carson one night, sitting beside him in a full metal breast plate she described the new style she was exploring as 'talk singing' ... not rap ... but 'talk singing' and this is well demonstrated on Nightclubbing ... this is a 9 song collection of Grace Jones fun!
B00AMPY54U|4.0|With the exception of a couple of not-so-good vocal cuts, most of this album sounds like the Tijuana Brass at its best.  For some reason, A&M has made this album in limited supply, but it deserves its place among all the Herb Alpert albums.  If you like Herb Alpert, you WILL like this album... IF you can find it!
B00785P2QC|3.0|good game but why do I have to like it on Facebook as one of the achievements that would only make me want to delete it. Sheesh!!!
193700788X|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  It was boring and not entertaining like the earlier books in the series.  It was if the author decided to bring in every single character from the previous books for a cameo appearance whether it was needed for the plot or not.  Eric was my favorite character from the series and he was barely in this book.  A very poor wrap-up for his character. I'm not sure if I'll bother to read any of Mrs. Harris's other books now.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Avengers Assemble turned me on to Shinedown.  Some of their work is a bit dark and brooding, but overall enjoyable rock!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Sound effects are clear.  The ability to tap a card and have it go to the logical place is so much easier than the drag method...and quicker as well.  Interesting card backs, and good neutrals for the background.  I have several solidarity games and this is The Best.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|three words best game ever!!!! it's a good game for all ages. U SHOULD GET THIS GAME. the best ever
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I've been hooked on Downton Abbey since the pilot. Season 3 should be free. Season 4 is already gone. Please.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am a huge Downton Abbey fan and am sooo excited to have the first two seasons. I will definitely be getting the next two also.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband and i love this series.  we are so excited about it we till everyone.  Can't wait to watch Season 4
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I was able to see the play on broad way before getting the movie and I loved both.  If you get a chance to see the play I would highly recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved every show and couldn't wait to watch the next.  We are hooked on this series.  We have fell in love with the family and staff are so great
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app makes balancing a checkbook as easy as ABC.  I am glad I found it. It is simple to use, the numbers are a very good size and they are easy to read.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am so sad that this is the last of the series. I am so attached to the characters that it almost feels as if I am losing close beloved friends. Thank you Mrs. Harris or all the years you shared such wonder characters with us. I will miss Sookie and all the other characters so much.
B008AYCSE4|3.0|It's an interesting movie about a sex addict who can't seem to have a normal relationship with his needy and emotional sister, who is played by Carrie Mulligan.  It's kind of a sad movie.  It's okay.  Can't say much else about it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|hard to see some of the &#34;things&#34; they are so tiny.  do many of these types of puzzles ..will keep at it i guess
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I loved this movie even though it was quite different from the book.  Acting was phenomenal by the entire cast.
B004LWZW24|4.0|If you are looking for a good haunted house film, this will fill the bill. Particularly effective, is the Director's (or creative staff generally) ability to mix the routine and ordinary with the supernatural. The less a film sticks on the one note, the more it is going to make the highspots really high. This is the customary mother and father with three children moving into a new house and, almost immediately finding trouble. I like the idea of not putting the action into the deserted cliched mansion  setting but, rather, into a solid middle class housing area and an ordinary nice middle class house.<br />How it will strike devotees of  the genre, I cannot say, but for those who only occasionally drop in on this type of movie (like myself), it should be effective.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun, addicting, puzzle game. You can compete in a weekly tournament against your Facebook friends.  Very easy to play. You just need to match 3 or more colors to get points. The faster you are the more points and bonus you get.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|We rarely have to think about the afterwards<br />... It is a great read and a different kind of twist on the road ahead of us all.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|The special effects in this film are stupendous, incredible, creative ... but more importantly, they shape and support a compelling storyline and redeeming message. For me, this is a film that I had to own and watch on a regular basis: the intersections of art, creativity, and engaging storytelling.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|its a great app<br />I love it.<br />It is so convenient to store all my data.<br />use it from anywhere.
B003A166OK|2.0|I was expecting action and humor, in the line of other Eastwood western films, instead there was too much dialogue that made the film predictable.
B009L32R5I|2.0|The vocals on these tracks are not good.  Not.  Good.<br /><br />I know it is nearly impossible to reproduce, or even re-imagine, the unique styling that Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins brought to the Genesis catalog, but the replacements on this collection (whom I will not name) are not worthy of the material.<br /><br />The instrumental portion is sublime, but it's hard to focus on Steve Hackett's work with these utterly pedestrian voices in the foreground.<br /><br />I didn't want to be disappointed, but I was.  I'll stick with the originals, thank you.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app works so well.  I have never had an issue with it.  It works well on the Kindle.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this . It is addicting and I spend way to much time playing it, but I sometimes can't help myself..
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The only Con I can think of is that the series is over.  Sanderson does a fantastic job realizing Robert Jordan's original vision.  It is just fantastic.
B0063GORYU|5.0|After figuring out how to play this game, I get caught up In it quite a lot. I love that it makes me think.
B0086UXYZO|4.0|THE VACCINES,as a combo,they have the ability to connect with their audience as well throughout their records or performing live!I could appreciate them in Lima/Perú,and of course they really come of pogo age.Their influences are blended by essences of TOM VERLAINE and his TELEVISION  band,THE RAMONES,WIRE,a little from THE SMITHS,THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN,THE STROKES...and the post punk revival<br /><br />What one can also appreciate is the  freedom that they have to perform and elaborate a record as Come of Age with such conviction of being underground.That phrase do it yourself  is sealed with the songs included on this record.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|One Word,,,,,Addicting.. I have sat for hours on end playing this game when I should of been doing house work,,, Love it.
B009NY43NY|1.0|If you like the Sookie Stackhouse series...DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!  Make up your own ending in your head and that will be much better than this load of crap.  I'm pretty sure Charlaine Harris didn't even write this book.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|great board space. fun interaction. cant wait for the next one. smooth floors. great backround and very cool options great game great game
B005PK57NU|5.0|Friends recommended this show to me and I was hooked after the first season, first episode.  It is very well acted and holds your interest and keeps you wanting more.  I've been able to watch all 3 seasons on my Kindle Fire with Prime and do enjoy it very much.  I hope Season 4 will be put on Prime.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|This book peaked my interest from the beginning.  However it started to waver toward the end.  I enjoyed how the author took me through the rough areas of Canada.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This read is great. so emotional. The intrigue is a nice touch. Am excited about book three. A surprise awaits!
0765325950|4.0|There were some loose ends. But overall, a good solid finish to the epic saga. I felt the characters were not being themselves and seemed frivolous which annoyed me as a long term fan of RJ. Apart from that, some of the questions were unanswered which left you wanting more.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Gift....
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Loved the game at first but as you go on there is always two hard to get....and they don't put up them shadow cards for ages....spoilt it for me as you got fed up playing knowing you won't get them...
193700788X|5.0|I must say that I did like the end of this book, it is open with a lot of possibility. I am happy that Charlaine Harris not only stayed true to the character of the characters in this series but also to herself. If you can not look beyond how \\"you\\" thought it should end and enjoy the story as it was told then you are missing out on a wonderful story. I loved how things were wrapped up and I will miss Sookie and the crew.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This is an all time cutest movie, I love it and my kids do as well.  It's a must see
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I finally decided to read World War Z, I was expecting something different not the several &#34;eye witness&#34; accounts presented throughout this book. It works though and the author truly has the ability to gain your interest with every point of view. Essentially the book is a compilation of short stories all narrated by a different person but yet all developed by a single author. His ability to develop these different characters and really give them their own unique qualities makes their stories more believable. I'm getting carried on, don't read any other zombie books just read this one cause it's not campy and is written by someone intelligent.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Could be real street action fiction.  I like the theme, and the characters in Sam Crow. Part I really like are the HD motorcycles.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This was such an absorbing, beautifully written novel that when I finished it, I immediately went back to the beginning and read it again! Also gives an amazing insight into life in Afganistan and the difficulties face by local people.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Started this game back in December after having surgery.  Now finding myself hurting home after work so that I can play for awhile before going to bed!  Very relaxing.  Love it!!!!!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|the killer you root for!!!!!! but let us face it he kills because he needs to , he gets pleasure out of killing so he is still a monster (not as bad as Donald Trump)
B009OYTAL8|4.0|Good story line, great action, perfect actor for the role. We always watch this show and really enjoy it. Bought this episode as we missed it.
037575251X|5.0|i love the story of wolves , i think  that is one reason i have only own german sheperds all these years
B009ME47H2|5.0|Adjustable gain for the microphone makes the app usable when recording a group or close up dictation. The adjustable quality makes this recorder as good as the expensive digital recorder that I own.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Fun movie, relaxing after a hectic day or week at work. If you enjoy music and some comedy you will like this movie.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Yet another HO adventure game that grabbed my attention and delivered! It makes you think and is still fun!! Keep them coming, G5!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game, with realistic features. I really like doing the shows and owning different horses! I always have a great time playing it!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I was introduced to this series by some of my teenage students.  I LOVE it!  I am completely hooked by the engaging characters, the continuity of the storyline and the unexpected twists in plot.  There is a mystery interwoven throughout the series that keeps me hooked for the next in line. It is a very tightly written series.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|it needs more time not cool but ok.  All my trends are playing . When I got it it only gave u three min do not get the game.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|Steampunk at it's best.  A great storey and I'm sad that it is ending.  Strong female characters and some really nasty ones as well liven this storey.  Well worth the time and effort to get to know these characters.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|There is not a lot to say about a free alarm clock app so i'll be brief.  It is a good free app that works as advertised.
B008602KQI|1.0|Where to begin..<br /><br />I waited for the hype to settle before watching this film. I knew the majority of movie goers loved it like it was a Shakespearean classic, and I didn't want to ruin my experience by believing it was a cinematic masterpiece, nor did I want to be overly disappointed by the opinions of the few critics out there (and there are so few). I did the right thing- I listened to neither. So, with a clean slate, I started my 2 hour and some odd minute journey with a clear head. Coffee in hand, I sat through oh, 4 minutes, before I realized it wasn't going to get any better.<br /><br />The empty connections between sisters and friends, the blatant and in your face \\"we're so starved and poor\\" setting, and the script that spells out the conditions of this other world without allowing the viewer to feel that impact themselves, was already a bad start. Yet, I held out hope for other aspects of this film. Excellent graphics-so sharp you could tell they weren't real. Costumes so absurd that you noticed the absence of substance even in the evil, rich people- I couldn't even hate them, there was so little to hate them for. I simply couldn't buy into this version of elitism. The vicious fights to the death that panned away, with the least amount of bloodshed for such graphic means of death. The romance between two people whom I was sure had met only days before (they really grew up together?), looking at each other more as the neighbor down the street rather than the love of one another's life. I wanted them to eat the berries. And most importantly, the outrage from the districts for being used as entertainment- scratch that, no one seemed pissed about that at all- even though they all felt that way (the script told me that, not the actual people in these horrific conditions).<br /><br />The icing on this poorly thrown together film, was at the very end. What does one do when they win a tournament so vicious that life could never be the same? They go home. The end.<br /><br />I honestly felt nothing from this film- nothing. I couldn't cheer for these kids, not a one. Not even the little girl (though she actually did a good job in her role- well done), because of the lack of a heart felt bond between her and Katniss. The scenario of these tournaments and their origins from the rebellion didn't even feel authentic. Who would invent this game as a means of control?? Not even in fiction would a story like this actually make sense. Maybe in book it did, but not in film. Not like this.<br /><br />I do realize that this was a family, blockbuster film, made purely for money, but come on! Couldn't they have tried to make it a little bit real? Maybe cause a sensation of something other than despair for having to sit through it. I wanted to feel outrage for their horrible circumstances, I wanted to feel the injustice that would be real in this society, but it seemed intentionally filmed and written to avoid any realism at all. Such a good story line wasted on the motto \\"asses in the seats\\".<br /><br />If you're looking for a popcorn action film that you'll forget within 6 months, this is definitely something you'll enjoy. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. Dumb films can be fun! But, if you wanted a good story told well, this is not the place wherein it exists. At the very least, don't expect much.<br /><br />Oh, the woods where this all took place was pretty. Liked the cinematography. Other than that..time to forget this ever happened.
B0063M22QO|3.0|It would be more exciting and challenging if you had a limited amount of shuffles.<br />The graphics are very clear.
0553583182|5.0|This book compliments what the Bible says about our mind and its ability to handle any situation.  As a man thinks so is he (Proverbs 23:7).  This book proves that the mind will work for anyone!  You really should understand what God has given us to use for our own benefit and for the benefit of others.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a Nicholas Sparks story where the &#34;boat&#34; does not sink.  One actually feels good, not sad, after reading it.  I usually shy away from Nicholas Sparks because he seems to like tragic endings.  I get enough of that in real life.  This book is different in that the ending is good - so don't be afraid to read it.  Nicholas Sparks is a very good writer in his ability to spin a tale, and this book is no different.  I would highly recommend it.
0062014102|5.0|An amazing book uses great examples and proves it points. I already realized most of mainstream science is based on perspective one thinking or just how we perceive reality. This book dwells far into the confines of quantum physics yet it is understandable and is accompanied by amazing backup stories and evidence.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book gives a unique view of WWII from a German's point of veiw (not a Natzi).  It reveals why a German Ace would aid a wounded American bomber - truly a higher call.  It is well written and extremely interesting.  I would highly recommend this book.
1416909532|5.0|i like this book, it was very good and now i am no longer in a relationship and this book helped me!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's a great  app to keep the  kids entertained. I would recommend this app to everyone. Great app for everyone.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|I must update my review.  I previously accused Blokish of being notification ad-driven, and I was wrong.  Today I found the ad notifications were coming from a different app that I had installed on the same day, and am now reviewing Blokish on its own merit.  So please dismiss my previous comments.  I apologize openly to the authors and publishers of Blokish.<br /><br />This is a really fun game.  I have never heard of it before, nor the board game it's based upon.  Very much like tetris, the concept is really simple and the game's interface is very intuitive and addictive.  I really agree with previous reviewers who recommend you read the help from the main screen.  It really does help!<br /><br />I am playing this on a Motorola Photon 4G, and I will say it probably looks a little bit better on a tablet, but still it is very easy to play and see on the Photon's smaller screen.  The concept doesn't really require fancy or articulate graphics, and if it had that, it would probably just make it harder to see on smaller devices such as mine.  However, for the future I might recommend adding some kind of conservative design elements as a toggle option for larger devices.<br /><br />The game's simplicity is its beauty.  Thanks for making a great game, and again, my apologies for my previous rant.
1883217040|2.0|My creditably:  I have a good understanding of harmony. My 3rd harmony book. I've studied a lot.<br /><br />Problems with this book:<br /><br />-His book has terrible harmony analysis, and thus terrible scales analysis. Mark speaks mostly through examples, and he does NOT give generalizations followed by use examples to delineate them. He doesn't talk about borrowing chords, (which imo is important.) Like he doesn't talk about how any chord can borrow from a relative scale, ie the II chord (normally Ionian) can be from any other mode, like from the Phrygian, Mixolydian, Melodic, ect. And his analysis on 2nd dominants was weak, and I dont' think he even talked about subsitute minor chords.<br /><br />-Some people may like how he puts many examples in his book. I however very disliked that. He did not do a good analysis on them, he very often says \\"play figure 3-28, and listen to the melodic scale in X's song.\\" This doesn't help imo, I could pick up any piece and there will always be a common figure of a sort  (melodic scale, ascending 4ths, ect), but I want analysis on structure of all jazz, not just examples. Surly examples help, but his book had hundreds of examples, that's just too much. It felt like a mesh. These examples are from jazz so they are very hard to sight read. I don't have time to learn how to play hundreds of 4 bars from random jazz standards.<br /><br />-Too wordy. I know jazz is relaxed, and such. But it feels like he rambles.<br /><br />-I didn't like its organization.<br /><br />You will learn some things from this book, but if you are beginning with Jazz you really should not start here. And especially if you're new to harmony you will waste your time reading this. It does not cover as much as it should and its inefficiently wordy. You're time will be better spent reading something else. I would say just download B erkly college's harmony pdfs. I found 4 pdfs (Harmony 1 2 3 4) online some years ago, those were extremely good when I began.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Good. A little slow. Not for people looking to watch something similar to knocked up. I liked it and would watch it again!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I bought the android game, &#34;Bubbles Touch&#34;, for my android smart phone. I love this game, as it has just the right amount of action, challenge and good graphics to make it fun and a perfect android smart phone game. For me this game is worth much more than its low price. I also play this occasionally on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; tablet and it plays well on it also. I highly recommend this android game.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|App would be great if it actually worked! It just randomly closes &amp; haven't been able to finish 1 picture. Sent email but not expecting to hear back. I've sent message before &amp; never got a reply. Very irritating.

B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Doesn't have too many of your typical story lines or cliches. I also bought it because I had a crush on Mila Kunis, but it's a good movie. You could do a lot worse but I think it's worth buying it's really not a bad movie.

1432794426|5.0|\\"Defending A King....\\" in my opinion, is a great book. It is an absolute MUST have for Michael Jackson fans, music lovers, and anyone else who may be curious about Jackson's true character. What I really love is that Dr. Moriarty is speaking to the reader in plain English. It feels as though you are hearing a story told by an old friend. She weaves her own life, thoughts, and opinions throughout the book and it helps us see Michael Jackson through the eyes of someone like us. I also love that she actually took the time to acquaint herself with people who ACTUALLY KNEW MICHAEL. That was very important to me as a lifelong fan. Since his passing, many books have come out and unfortunately, the majority have been nothing but third-rate, gossipy, \\"tell-all's\\" that depend on scandal instead of FACTS. Dr. Moriarty actually did her homework and put together an honest, dignified, book that honors Michael Jackson's life instead of glorifying his struggles and his downfalls. He was a human being, first and foremost and every human being deserves a fair, honest telling of their story however grand, confusing, complex, and difficult their life may have been. Great book!
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|It needs more graphics - after a while, the same scenes begin to get dull and boring.  Please, add more backgrounds and challenges.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|shark is way to hard to move, kind of frustrating when the ppl get away, shouldnt be able to out swim a shark
B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|We enjoyed the movie.  The story is well developed and the acting is great.  The topic is just a little too close to home.
B00785P2QC|5.0|NO LAG. THANK GOD!!!There was on my phone. But with the updated version its better. Its a great game. DOWNLOAD FOR SURE
B004UHL9EK|5.0|A wide variety of alarms, from sounds to music, plus the ability to set both alarms for specific times and timers for any length of time, make this one of my most used apps. I have half a dozen recurring alarms set after just a few weeks' use. My only complaint is that it doesn't play clearly if my kindle is not in use when the alarm goes off. It is audible but it seems to stutter initially. It's mildly annoying, but not enough to lose a full star.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|It wasn't until the end that the story's whole sank in as a great and memorable book that will leave an impression on me to remember for all time... maybe I'll read it to my children some day.
0143122916|4.0|A compelling story of a young man's life beginning in a North Korean labor camp. His escape attempt and life in China and the West is also covered. Harrowing when one realized how many other horrible stories are yet to be told about life in the N.K regime.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This is a very nice game.  It gives you limited time to clear as much as you can.  I love it.

B00992CF6W|4.0|While I myself prefer playing Minecraft on the PC, and thus being a bit skeptical of how well this game would preform because of this experience, I did not look so fondly to playing it. But, when I DID play it, albeit just recently, my views were changed completely. It is phenomenal! It has almost all of the updates the PC version has and even adds a tiny bit to it that the PC version doesn't. Although, as good as it is, the only cons I can see would be it's lack of a larger world, a better control interface, and the ability to actually have all the items in creative mode as it so states. All in all I give Minecraft Pocket Edition a 4 out of 5. Nice job Mojang, this customer is happy.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|this is a very fun app only one thing bad to say. you run out of algea to fast other than that great game I would recommend this game to any one.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The music to Les Miz is the most stirring, passionate music ever.<br />Even with actors (not true singers).<br />Anne Hathaway's performance is the most gut-wrenching, raw emotional performance on screen.<br />But then there's Russell Crowe. Bad casting period.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Beautiful, touching, a work of art. This book reaches people of all ages because it shows love, compassion, war, and death and why all these things can be useful or needed. I read this years ago and loved it then. This time I was able to pick up a story completely hidden to me as a young person. If a person who didn't read often asked for a book to read, this is a book I would recommend, along with The Legacy of Herot. Both books with meaning and lots of thought, but a lot more action.
B000069AUH|5.0|Sounds so much better than my digital copy.  Not many bells and whistles inside (no lyric sheet, the fold out is only a picture, and limited liner notes), but great music.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love books that draw me in and make me want to read on and on! This book does just that. Now I'm sad that I'm done. :)
B0038NN3B4|5.0|The previous Atkins book was good, but the diet would be hard to live with as a lifestyle.  This version starts you off with very much the same diet in the induction phase, but adds in vegetables.  Then, you slowly add in the good carbohydrates as you ween yourself off all the starchy, processed carbs that you really never need.  This is not a fad, but a healthy lifestyle that is easy and simple.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game it works great . It has all kinds of suits! It even has Mark 42 and iron patriot.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a pleasant find. Some people have mentioned that it is overly technical. I didn't think so at all - the technical puzzle solving was a great way to tell this story!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I have really enjoyed listening to this CD, great songs. Love his voice and the sound. Worth getting and listening.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I have always had an interest in Lincoln and the Civil War so I was looking forward to this movie.  Sometimes anticipation isn't rewarded with excellence, but this time it was.  The movie was beautifully done, and Daniel Day-Lewis played the role of Lincoln beautifully.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book. Cant seem to put my tablet down and stop reading!!!!! I'd recommend to anyone. Get it now.
0374214913|5.0|An enormously fun journey!  Combine the world's oldest printed books with the world's most cutting edge technology in a quest to discover the secret of living forever!  Robin Sloan has created a truly unique quest that takes the reader from the narrow high-ceiling 24-hour bookstore, to a secret vault under the streets of Manhattan, to the heart of Google and on to the vast warehouse of the misplaced treasures of the world in the Nevada desert.  The most fun I've had reading this year.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not a full story where you can get into the characters.  Just like reading reports, some better than others.  i still like it, I am sure the movie would have to expand on a few of the reports.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|The Following follows in the Fox tradition of \\"24\\" and \\"Prison Break\\". You are literally sitting on the edge of your seat watching every episode. Kevin Bacon and James Purifoy are outstanding. The overall concept of a serial killer with a cult following is amazing and the scripts are well-written. In my opinion, this is this year's \\"Homeland.\\"
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If the first book gives you whiplash the second will leave you feeling like you'll never get your head on straight again! Don't get me wrong Silvia Day continues her HOT scorching story in this continuation of the crossfire series. This is not for the faint of heart, the second book delves more into the dark past of the two main characters. But it lacked the intensity of the first book. Waiting to download the next installment and hope that the two come to a HEA.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Sad when I finished the last book.  I wanted it to keep going!  Fell in love with the characters and the story.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|I have a 7.1 home theater setup, so that's a lot of wire running around my living room. I was always interested in banana plugs for my speakers but never wanted bite on the extra cost. However with the Amazon Basics line I've been finally able to afford a lot of the accessories I always wanted to try. This set gives you 12 pairs of plugs for a great price. The best part also is that Amazon Basics products have never disappointed me quality wise unlike other retailer's own brands. The plugs make the connections easier, more secure, prevent oxidization of the wire and more. It's fantastic little appendage and after you recover from the initial cost of a home theater I would recommend these guys.
B0097K21YW|4.0|similar idea to angry birds. nice play. although no real instructions it was easy enough to figure out. passes the time nicely.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I think everyone should read this book! We introverts are out there and this book offers an understanding of what that means about how we work and socialize best. I found the book persuasive, it does a good job explaining the different ways introverts act in work and school, and why this works for them, information that I'd love to put in the hands of managers and schoolteachers. I think also that the book could be helpful to introverts who may have come to feel there is something &#34;wrong&#34; with their preference for getting work done alone in a peaceful environment, or socializing in smaller, more intimate groups rather than raucous parties.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|VERY COOL! Hours of fun! I had to use my brain and that was the best part! I do hope they make more rooms.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I found the case studies presented by Ms. Sandberg to be interesting and illuminating. As a woman who works in business, and manages/works with other women, I think she has nailed how women sometimes sell themselves short.
B00BLYFDO2|5.0|This album really surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. I've listened to it dozens of times now since buying it and I love it. I've been an Iggy fan for a long time now and I also really like the album that preceded this one, The Weirdness too, which a lot of people seemed to trash for some reason? Anyway, maybe it's that certain Eighties era sound that I enjoy the most about this album? It's supposed to be a throwback to the 70's sound but I think that it has more of an 80's retro feel to it that sounds like it could have been \\"New Values Volume 2\\" instead. Which really doesnt bother me because Iggy's Arista records have always been my favorites anyway so this album is a welcome addition to my collection. The lyrics, guitars, just everything about it is fantastic.
B00BAF7OYY|5.0|Some people have been giving this album a bad name but they're just hating because there's more and more things of MJ being released post death. I feel it's great to have new or anniversary releases of things. My mom bought the Deluxe edition of the album with the two CDs as a birthday present to me. I love it very much. I'm only in my 20s and may have gotten into MJ's music in early 2006 after his trials were over but I loved every minute of it. This release has demos and unreleased songs on the second CD which is awesome.<br /><br />I'd tell all Michael Jackson fans to go out and buy the Deluxe edition of BAD 25 if you truly love the man and the music. There's no reason why anyone should be calling it crap or a poor attempt for his Estate to make money. I have multiple release versions of BAD and also of Thriller. Hell I have more than one release of \\"Off the Wall\\". I'm a true fan and will continue to purchase every release of everything his Estate has to put out. :) King of Pop forever and always.
B00AOCZOLO|5.0|This is an incredible show with a fantastic cast and stellar writing.  The first few episodes of the show had a little trouble finding a groove, but it has gotten steadily more amazing with each episode.  This second season was even better, with the last ten episodes of the season just blowing all other comedies out of the water.  All the characters are amazing, and the story between Nick and Jess that took off at the second half of this second season has made them THE best tv couple of all time.  Their chemistry just cannot be matched on any other show.  The storylines are fun, but realistic and move organically at the same time.  If the writers see a story developing (like the love between roommates, Nick and Jess) they don't hold back because they think they \\"should\\".  They just GO FOR IT, and the show is so much better because they're willing to take those kinds of risks.  They've developed and matured the characters at a realistic pace, without ever making you feel like they were doing it because it's what we \\"expected\\".  If you watch the first episode and the last episode that just aired you can see how much the characters have grown, but it was all done in such a realistic and believable way.  This is exactly what a \\"family\\" looks like when you're living on your own in your thirties.  An incredibly refreshing approach to television and comedy.  Can't wait for Season 3 in September!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|If you are into the acappella sounds and the ability that folk have to &#34;become&#34; instruments with their voices, you will LOVE this movie just for the music!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I like the art and it has a good story line. Also it helps that it has a amazing multiplayer experience.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really like the way King develops the characters in this story. He also does a particularly good job of capturing the period...very nostalgic for anyone who grew up in the 60's. And of course, there is always the strange, the wierd, the eerie twists that Stephen King does so well. One of his better stories - I am looking forward to the movie.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|My daughter wanted this app to practice for a program at her school.  It helped her with that and more.  She loves it!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I never read a book so fast. I couldn't put it down. Great book all-around,  I  hope the second one is as good as the first.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book, a must read for anyone who is a fan of video games or the 80's
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Once again Jeffrey Archer has written a real \\"page -turner\\". I can hardly wait until the next \\"Clifton Chronicle\\" is available.<br />Well done Mr. Archer.
B009GEPPYC|3.0|Well, if you like musicals that highlight all the hair band 80s tunes, this is the one for you! Best part of the entire movie is Tom Cruise's performance to a classic Bon Jovi anthem. Cruise does his own singing in this movie, for which he took voice lessons for more than 4 months to accomodate the role. It paid off because Crusie is not a bad Rocker! If you're a Tom Cruise fan, it's worth it! If you're a fan of the 80's, it's worth it for entertainment value.
B006M4F67A|5.0|One of my favorite games...can play for hours. Especially like this version over others because I am not bothered by ads.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|Who doesn't love all the hot pilots and Tom Cruise in their prime. Oh and the story isn't bad either!
B001NEK2GE|2.0|Keys badly placed; one has to look at the unit to use several of the more out of the way keys, or risk hitting others.  Oft mistook one key for another due to horrid placement.  Think devs wanted visually stunning symmetrical unit w/LCD to look at instead of the screen.  This is useless for hardcore gaming.<br /><br />M (macro set) keys cannot be disabled (only the coloration of them can) and they switched profiles on me in the 1st 3 pvps i used the unit with as are too close to the G (gaming) keys so they get hit a lot.  Had to pry the keys off.<br /><br />Gave the unit a month, but went back to my N52te, and that is even broken.  52 far superior in design, layout-wise.<br /><br />Next time, Logitec should get ACTUAL GAMERS to design the layout.<br /><br />Waste of $.
B0036OODFU|4.0|Cute, warm and fuzzy movie. Good one to watch if you've had a tough day or week and you just want some mindless entertainment, where you don't have to think about following alot of action or a &#34;heavy&#34; plot line.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Complete disappointment. I could have gotten a better story from one of the free books on Amazon. I will never read a book by Harris again. And if we go off the people in my facebook readers group saying the same thing if she was wishing to end her writing career this was a good way to do it. Not going to lie I don't even want to watch True Blood anymore if this is how it is going to end as well. Thanks for blowing it Ms. Harris, so glad to know you give a crap about your readers *please note the sarcasm there*.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This show never ever fails to entertain with fresh storylines. It's absolutely the best Crime Show with Humor on television and somehow never gets the respect it deserves. These characters become &#34;people you know&#34; because each is so defined. I own every season on DVD and hope this show goes on another 10 seasons... IT'S THAT GOOD!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|have a lot of fun but unfortunately I'm not getting anything done that I should because I play this to long
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great game but it's not long enough!  I hope there is more to come! Very interesting game to play very fun.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Tugs at your heartstrings. I thought the actor who played the oldest son was amazing.  It's a miracle anyone survived that.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|But it really wraps up with a bang and twists and turns that you don't see coming. A great ending to a great trilogy.
B00932DCS8|5.0|A well crafted story with twists and turns and solid acting. Nothing is gratuitous and nothing is what it seems. Brilliant directing and acting do justice to a very good book.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I love this game, it is like a cheaper version of world of watercraft. The graphics are beautiful and I believe a lot of bugs have been fixed. I love the Mendels, they make me think of ewalks from star wars
B008QTVNUI|5.0|It was as good as everyone says it was.  The second season was equally enjoyable, and I am looking forward to season 3.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Its funny, and its true.  I love the actors that played in these roles. If you are a parent or not you will learn a little.  or you can just buy the book that gives you more info
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Picks up close to where the original show ended.  If you enjoyed the original program, you will most certainly enjoy this continuing saga.
0399226907|5.0|I love the format, a board book with varying widths of pages with a little way of showing how caterpillars grow into butterflies.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like the concept and it's easier and faster than searching on the Internet for photos in areas of interest. My one and only complaint is that it keeps crashing. I'm using it on three platforms: Kindle Fire, iPhone, and iPad. Not all the features are the same with each of these. I find it easier to use the Kindle to do some things, but the phone/pad faster for looking. Am new to it, so maybe it's the way I'm doing/not doing things. It's a great inspiration board and like posting ideas and having them handy/
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Don't know too many that Cancer has not touched. This book did not dwell on the sad, but gave a glimpse into how some make the most of the inevitable.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This album seems to flow along with an easy breeziness.<br />The harder staccato vocal deliveries and raggae influences have mellowed a bit on this album, into almost effortlessness.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I used to watch this show when it was new and i love just as much now as I did then
B007FH9GT2|4.0|Dark movie...full of intrigue and ugliness.  But so well acted that I couldn't help but find it entertaining.  Don't know if it was so much entertaining as it was interesting.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Serves the purpose, using it as a back up.  Eleven more words required for what purpose? This puts me off from doing this exercise.
B003QWRA3Y|4.0|Though this is not a typical subject matter for me, the movie was very well done, and the twists in plot kept it interesting. Well acted & haunting theme.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The book is written in such an interesting way that I couldn't wait to make time through my busy day to continue reading it. The author has managed to offer a trusted approach to Lincoln's personality, friends, rivals, and all the politics and main issues prevalent at Lincoln's time and their overall influence in his biggest decisions with such fluency that the many details do not bother but instead enrich the story. I strongly recommend this book. It greatly helps to appreciate the personal dimension of Lincoln's humanity, intelligence and great political acumen, as well as his contemporaries political and personal features.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is my favorite out of all my games but i can't just say that you should buy it and try it out you'll get addicted XD.
0393317552|5.0|I read Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, and was fascinated. This book is equally fascinating and includes language groups and other material on how human populations of the world developed differently, or similarly, in farflung places in different times, and why that may have happened.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A uniquely story well told - surprising and satisfying. Probably the most insightful characterization of borderline personality I've read. Yikes.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Amazing movie it is a must see it is a long movie but it is worth it the actors are amazing I have seen the musical and this movie is just as good
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I love the musical, have seen it several times, have read the book as well as the sequel and love everything about it. So naturally I was curious to see how a movie would compare to it.<br />The movie was well made, kind of in dark tones though, the costumes were good but the singing was just okay for me. A big surprise was Anne Hathaway, she sang lovely as well as \\"Marius\\" (Eddie Redmayne) but Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and also Amanda Seyfried were just plain bad.<br /><br />I like them all as actors but please don't cast them in singing roles. Amanda Seyfried did well in \\"Mama Mia\\" but I guess Abba songs are a different category as a musical and suit her voice and range better.<br /><br />All in all, I think if you have the chance to see the musical you are better off. If all you can do is see the movie, go for it, you have nothing to loose because you have nothing to compare it to.<br />Big names alone don't make a movie, especially if singing is required.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|I thought it was a cute, fun movie. Turns out to be a cute love story. More for young people.
B00C7L4QB4|4.0|NBC is taking fairly large risk in trying to adapt Thomas Harris' books to the small screen - it was always going to be problematic finding a replacement for Anthony Hopkins and then manipulating the material to fit the needs of a weekly police procedural. For the most part it works but I'm hoping they get a second series to fine-tune the elements that don't quite fit.<br /><br />Mads Mikkelson is about as good as a replacement for Hopkins as I could have hoped for. The actor is adept at switching between the cold exterior of the character and showing emotion when the need arises to evade detection. They largely avoid showing him kill anyone and focus on the cannibalistic aspect of the character in between his psychiatric work. He's just creepy enough so that when Will Graham finally figures it out, it feels like the clues were there all along. He doesn't convey the instant savagery that Hopkins provided so well but he seems to get more comfortable with the role as the series progresses.<br /><br />Will Graham on the other hand is a difficult atypical character, cursed with a near-psychic ability to dissect a crime scene, treading the edges of sanity, and ultimately not particularly likable especially for a new TV show. Some of his behavior is hard to understand in the context of the show (the sleepwalking, the visions of the stag, hearing things, etc.) but I've had the hope that ultimately these will be blended into the story line more effectively than they were introduced.<br /><br />Many viewers are going to take issue with the level of violence in the show which is like watching some sort of macabre fairy tale. Personally, I've read the books and watched the films and know that any TV adaptation of the material isn't going to be made for family-friendly viewing. The presentation of the the weekly crime scenes is handled as tastefully as NBC could get away with but if graphic violence bothers you, it may be too hard to overcome.<br /><br />Hannibal is by no means perfect but there are enough positives to keep me coming back each week and it seems to improve with each episode. The writers are trying to explore and push the material in different directions and I think with a little more time it should become a 5-star piece of prime time drama.perfect but there are enough positives to keep me coming back each week and it seems to improve with each episode.

B0076DELIG|5.0|My first time to read a Harry Bosch novel. Have read other books by the author.  The character is strong and the suspense builds throughout the story. Not too many twists and turns, but enough to keep you interested.<br />I will purchase addtional books with this character.
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|Installed and just stays a white screen...I would have to say that a white screens is extremely useless.  Installed, then did not work and then un installed and installed and yet still did not work and the vicious cycle begins.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I just finished the game a second time on the high difficulty level. It took me a few months to complete it and my family can testify that I was addicted! Very fun and challenging, unlike regular match-three games. Well worth a dollar!
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I haven't even finished it because it has such filthy language. I was not expecting that and it was jumping around too much. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it.
B0097K21YW|5.0|This is so much fun!  Blast buildings with fire, tnt, nukes, etc.  Watch them burn, fall over, hit other buildings, blow up, etc.  Easy to learn and play, it will burn hours off of your free time!  Burn baby burn!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I've read the Jack Reacher novels....He is a brute of a man over 6' 6&#34; and weighs in at about 235 lbs. His presence is room dominating. Now Tom Cruise may be a good actor, but he could not carry out the true menace that Jack Reacher was in his novels. The whole movie was just flat because of the absent feeling of  menace that the Jack Reacher character generates throughout the Reacher Novels. Tom Cruise is the wrong star for this picture.
B008Q00BOQ|3.0|This was so hard to watch. Usually, I like action-thrillers but this one dragged on and on until the last quarter of the film. That's when some really spectacular stunts hit the screen, mesmerizing. Somehow also I found Thandie Newton just did not have enough screen presence to make the viewer care about her. Unfortunately, she has only a couple of  expressions repeated throughout the film. So, it's OK, but not that great.
072325804X|5.0|It is so much bigger than I expected. It is a wonderful way to end the day at bedtime. All the classic illustrations in the little books. My granddaughter loves it so much, I had to download the book for my Kindle to continue reading it on the go! Great Value!
B00007BKVC|4.0|Caution: while the movie itself is great, and well worth owning, prospective purchasers should know that the edition Amazon is currently shipping is *not* the one depicted (the \\"Special Edition\\"), and does not have all the special features listed in the description. Most notably, it doesn't have \\"'Thelma & Louise: The Last Journey': a 2001 three-part documentary... featuring new interviews,\\" which another reviewer here describes as \\"the most rewarding extra feature on the disc.\\"<br /><br />When I received it and discovered this I contacted customer service, and was offered an exchange with the assurance that the replacement would be the edition described in the listing. Instead I got another copy of the same (incorrect) edition... leaving me (A) to conclude that's all Amazon has in inventory now, and (B) to return *two* copies of the film to Amazon.<br /><br />If you only want the movie (and the commentary tracks), order this. But if you want all the special features, you're better off looking for a second-hand copy.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is such an excellent series! Every character is perfectly cast. I watch an episode a day and I always end up either laughing out loud or smiling. This is so rare in today's violence driven shows. I started watching because I saw it had Brendan Coyle in it, but all the cast is excellent! I love it!
B002IR9ZSG|5.0|I needed a scene or two for a class I was teaching.  Amazon came through for me with high-quality streaming video.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Perhaps more than almost any other film, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" permeates the soul and stimulates the spirit while challenging the viewer to fully grasp its sequential order or delve into its true meaning. These puzzlements notwithstanding, it exists as a singular entity with a steady stream of subliminal visions, Buddhist gatherings, and outstanding characterizations throughout. Perhaps best when not over analyzing its motives, the stellar performances by Hanks, Berry, Sarandon, et.al. along with the story lines whose similarity can in fact be easily identified, helps establish this film as a major accomplishment that requires singular judgment and evaluation when questioning its viability. If considered more a linear based challenge of unfocused messages and heartfelt moralities, it will satisfy most of its viewing and puzzle those more accustomed to clearly defined boundaries. For those whose imagination can surround its visions it will seem a masterpiece. A project more complex than the usually viewed episode, and more rewarding to those who can bond with its boundaries.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|That's what you are thinking the entire book. Well written, suspenseful, even understandable from a parent's point of view. First the father's, then the mother's, then flipping back again. Wow. A crazy ride and a good, page turning read!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I only hope this isn't the only app Disney puts out. The grand kids and I can't get enough. Not only is it fun it's also educational. Wow can't wait to play it again this afternoon when they come back over.
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|I appreciated the realism of the movie and the depiction of what it would have been like to be on a U-boat in WW2.  One gets the impression of a script written by someone who had the experience.  The ending was somewhat disappointing but a typical European twist - no, no spoilers - decide for yourself.
B00CE379IM|5.0|If you are a Harry Potter/Twilight purist, then you won't be happy with this liberal retelling. Characters were melded, left out. This is a very well written series, so hang on to your familiars, this is just the first. I expect a television series or another film made within the decade.
B00AQLGXTU|5.0|Read it in like one day. Great twists and further complications of the story.  Hope i don't have to wait a year to See what Happens next...
1401937519|5.0|Anita is writing in a way that every one can read it. It is such a heart warming story and it can change every one's life! If one starts to understand that illness is not something we have to be a victim of, live begins without the big shadow of fear that the medical lobby what to us to believe. Illness is an ally that shows us what we did not understand in life and what we can do about it. Cancer is a typical sample of a fear program that is pure propaganda of the medical lobby. This is clear for me since over 3 decades since I had also a healing experience that exposed the allopathic medicine as fraud. So I am very happy that this knowledge is becoming more and more open and mainstream.<br />Nobody has to amputate breasts, like Angelina Jolie just did, this is the most crippling fear mongering to make a person do that! All the side effects from such an operation and fear connected to it, are actually calling for cancer.<br />Anita's experience is a fantastic sample for people to learn what life is about. I am deeply grateful that she came back to share her story and more people can start to understand something that is so profound that it truly can complete change lives.<br />Thank you Anita ~ I love you!  Katharina Bless, Thailand

B00881PTRC|5.0|This game is so funny. The animation that takes place while you are trying<br />to figure out your word is just a riot.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed a game of hangman.  This edition is so fun it just makes<br />my day whenever I play it.<br /><br />If you need a laugh and a little enjoyment in your day then download<br />this game.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I don't like movies without a definite finale.  Hope there is a sequel.  Without Liam Neeson , it would not have been good at all
B007SYWFRM|4.0|LOVE the game but it has some kind of glitz in it. I had to delete my old game. Which I Was at level 60. Then reload a new game from beginning. The old game just froze and would not download to play.It would act like it was downloading, but then go back to the main screen . I found out it was one of the problems that gameloft live knows about and are trying to fix. But after a week of waiting to see if they would answer my questions . Because I have spent allot of money buying acorns and allot of time on the game. I wanted to see if they could retrieve my old game but still have not received an answer. I missed the game so much I deleted the old game and downloaded a new one which you have to start all over again . So it is a little addicting fun game for a 51 year old grandma to start all over. And I do have to add gameloft live did answer other questions fast and convenient any other time when I had a question.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I love watching this series. I keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great story line and great acting. I recommend this series.
B007FU1OH6|5.0|Barcelona is as much a character in this book as the other wonderful characters. This book ties the earlier ones together but still leaves room for more. As soon as I finished this I wanted to read it again. There is something about these novels that gets inside of you.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Good looking and entertaining game. Reasonably challenging, but not overly so. I highly recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games. My only complaint is the length of the game. Identifying abnormalities in the boxes that advance the game moves a little quickly once you recognize the pattern.
B004EI2NM2|4.0|Very well done beautiful set and girls and liked a lot go get if you like this type movie. A great movie,
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I love this movie. It tells the story of how Jesus was crucified very well and touches your heart both at the same time. If your a Christian, Protestant, Lutheran, Catholic, or any other religion that believes that Jesus is the Messiah and you follow his teachings and read the bible, than I highly suggest you buy this movie. Highly recommenced. This movie will make you realize just how much Jesus loves you and the sacrifice he had to make of his own FREE WILL to die for your sins and make all things new. The movie every Christian should watch and buy. Buy it.
B0044VTC0A|5.0|romance and love from a guy's desired perspective. fairly fast paced, with reawakening, action, save the day and all ends happy.
B003Z4JQIA|5.0|I absolutely loved these! I had them for a year a half before they wore out. I think I wore them almost every day, and they must have had several hundred to a thousand miles on them. They are great for walking around and going through creeks. They do take a while to try afterwards though.they are a bit heavy as far as sandals are concerned, but they are worth it.  Originally, I bought a similar pair but they had different stitching and broke after just a month or so. These have lasted so long and I plan to get new ones quite soon. I highly recommend these.
B00BKBCF38|3.0|Opus Eponymous was GHOST'S first disc and I believe is their best.  Infestissumam is good, but does not contain the riffs, hooks, and melodies that made their debut so interesting. This one has the Latin chants, the Buck Dharma drawn-out alto vocals; it really does sound like a companion to Opus Eponymous. I can't help but say I was a little disappointed with this release --- it's not bad, but a little of the sophomore slump thing is going on.<br />I found myself enjoying this one as more of an great \\"atmosphere creator\\" rather than an album that you listen to intently. I'm curious what others think because I really like this band.
1426209584|5.0|The pictures in this collection are specatcular.  I understand that there will be a DVD coming out later and will need to get this as well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the only weather app I use, I even use it over the weather men on television.  This app has not told me the wrong weather yet.  I recommend this app. Keep up the good work.
B004LAIU4I|4.0|The review stated that it was the best CD since Graceland (which is saying a lot as Graceland is a classic).  I liked the songs okay but it seemed short/incomplete.  I actually found the songs on Hearts and Bones more memorable but these are very good as well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like this app because there are so many things pinned on it by so many different people, there is so much to look at and it is great just to see the ideas that people come up with.  I recommend this app.
0767827791|1.0|This is a &#34;full screen&#34; bastardization, not a restoration, of the Cinemascope aspect ratio.  Very, very disappointing.  Don't buy it.
B008602KQI|4.0|This was filmed near where I live and the scenery is awesome.  I enjoyed the story and characters but they were not developed enough to get me really intrigued.  I think the movie had some potentially touching and emotional moments, but these were somewhat undermined by a dependence on special effects and not enough focus on the individuals.  I really wish they had put more emphasis and closure on the romance between the main character and her man back home.<br /><br />- Matthew's Review
015603588X|5.0|Read the book after seeing the movie and was impressed with the way the film captured the book's flavor and ambiguity. Makes you think and examine your life and beliefs. Loved it!
B00BMR5HOO|4.0|I love it.  I like that I can see weather outside of the app. It's very nice but I don't like how when u download it it's starts out at Celsius
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Great classic that needed to be upgraded to Bluray.... I also love it because my granddaughter loves it and we sit together and enjoy....its part of our veggy time movies with each other
B000FC1HBY|5.0|What a great book! I could not put it down. Intense and awesome. If you like fantasy novels at all, read this series!
B0021L9ME6|5.0|I am a great fan of the Batman series....and have loved a few stars that played Catwoman over the years, but Halle Berry is the best when it comes with just a cat woman movie.... I could see her hooking up with one of the new Batman's coming down the line...
B00138CZ8S|4.0|How did I not find out about this gem before now? Excellent, bluesy masterpiece with a laid back, easy feel.
B00AFOS9I6|2.0|Product is identified as NTSC ALL REGIONS  on Amazon and package, but disc is marked \\"FSK ab 0 freigebeden\\".<br /><br />1st 3 attempts to load results in INVALID and CANNOT OPERATE THIS DISC<br /><br />4th: loaded<br /><br />5th-10th: wouldn't load<br /><br />11th: loaded<br /><br />I then tested 5 other blu-ray discs.m several times each....all loaded the first time.  Tried DW again, and couldn't get it to load.<br /><br />So it's either the wrong format or a defective disc.  I will follow up here after I receive the replacement.
B002M87W2W|5.0|I definitely consider watching this movie. It is absolutely amazing. The story line is great and it really portrays the life of the people in the Victorian Era
193700788X|1.0|It's not often I say that the Tv series is better than the books.  At least the series does a better job staying true to the characters.  This series was so good at first and then you could literally feel just where it was that the author was just feeding you garbage in order to prolong the series to make more money.  I stuck through with the books because I had faith that Ms. Harris knew what she was doing and everything would make sense in the end.  I was completely wrong.  This author lost imagination and passion towards the end of the series unfortunately it was at readers expense.<br /><br />If you insist on reading this book then just borrow it from the library or a friend.  Or better yet watch the Tv series.  At least Alan Ball recognized who Charlaine's interesting characters are and how better to bring them to light.  All I can say is that Ms. Harris probably realized what a better job someone else was doing with her characters, felt intimidated, and just decided to end the series in the only choppy way she could.  As much as people like to trash Twilight, Twilight was at least thought out and followed through in a much better manor than this.<br /><br />I will NEVER purchase another book from this author again.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I have giv en googke four stars. However, I am not always pleased with google when I use my phone. Yahoo gives me better service.
B008VVT51U|5.0|I loved the story of the people coming to the hotel and the young man trying to save the hotel - it's especially appropriate for the older generation. The story is surprisingly touching.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Pacing dragged this story down.  Should not have been a Best Picture nominee though Jessica Chastain did do well in the role of a woman with tremendous determination and tenacity.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I was skeptical about getting this app after reading all of the bad reviews,but tried my luck anyway when I realized that the new Kindle Fire HD has GPS. I've not had any issues with getting this app to work. In fact, it works great and totally worth .99&cent;&hellip;
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I can't believe how good this looks. They did a great job on the release of this. I probably think it looks great because I used to watch it when I was 8 on TBS on SD well before HD was ever thought of.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|very good story line and upbeat action...well worth your time<br />a few surprise keep you interested throuhout<br />I would watch again
B008602KQI|5.0|Thought provoking and scary, yet not truly gory. No foul language, just good acting. hard to imagine we could ever stoop to such a thing, but...
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Still loving that sweets craving little guy. The gameplay still fun, and the new levels challenge! Go ahead give time travel a try.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Easy read with lots of action and the ability to keep your attention throughout.  Well worth the price i paid.
0143034901|5.0|Very well-written.  First time reading Zaf&oacute;n.  Plot had depth; characters were personal; history and setting were intriguing.  Could not put it down.<br />Was pleased with price and quick arrival along with second book, The Angel's Game, which I have not read yet.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|The game is great and i got alot of practice but i hate how you can only turn the com up to challenging and i hate the glitches in the main menu
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Inspiring, witty, humorous and beautifully written-author transports you into a world of adventure and incredible challenges.  Recommended to my friends.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Definitely the best big budget blockbuster of the year so far. Does not disappoint on any level whatsoever. While the fans may have been impatient for Abrams to get the ball rolling on this sequel ever since the release of the 2009 franchise reboot, practical reasoning makes it obvious that waiting is always better if the product is successful. In this sequel, the same emotions, feelings, and thoughts from the first Star Trek are all explored again, but on a much deeper and more aggressive level. This also goes for everything else in the movie. Much like the first movie, the acting is superb, the action is crazy but terrific, and the unexpected plot points are of course, always welcome. Some have compared this film to 'Iron Man 3', 'Skyfall', and 'The Dark Knight Rises' in its execution. They say that they are all too similar in plot, because they all feature a central male character that is known to regret his feelings and actions from the past. They all feature an enigmatic villain that defeats and/or humiliates the character on their own turf. The main character then has to make a decision whether or not to step outside their comfort zone, all at potential great cost to everyone else. While I agree that these similarities are true and very interesting, they do not discredit any of the mentioned films. Each of these films is fashioned in a different way, and gives the viewer an entirely different feeling. So I, for one, no matter what any detractors of this film may say, highly recommend this film to any Star Trek or sci-fi fan, or any movie fan in general. It is absolutely amazing.
193700788X|2.0|Before I read Dead Ever After, I decided to read some of the reviews to soften the blow, because I KNEW this book was not going to be good.  Dead Ever After was very boring, and a sad way to wrap up such a great series.  The decline came around book 10 or 11 of this series and each book has gotten worse and worse.  I expected this, but felt I needed to see this series through.<br /><br />I won't give anything away, but there are a lot of cameos that do not make any sense, and Sookie's love life takes a weird turn.  The only thing that makes me sad is thinking about how exciting the start of the series was.  I couldn't get enough.  I remember first picking up Dead Until Dark and devouring it, thinking it was so incredible.  The author simply got bored of the character--and stopped trying.  Such a bummer.  Just be prepared that the conclusion of this series is just as weak as the last three books have been.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I was not disappointed with this purchase. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a great way to pass the time during my lunch break, commute to work, or waiting in line!
B0052Z3IZC|5.0|Superbly interesting book with twists and humor that makes you think about the commonly accepted realities of our lives. Sanity or insanity is just a matter of perspective. Brilliant!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Recommended by a different book club member.  I like WWII books and this had a different angle.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|This book is not really a love story if you ask me but still pretty interesting and totally worth reading it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book shows a different look at the subject of life after death. This book is not the same stories that usually go along eith this subject. I would this book to anyone interested in the subject of this book.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|I liked this better than Wuthering Heights. It was a little long in some parts but that's probably just because I had seen the movie and knew where it was going and wanted to get there already!
B00BTYP6QE|3.0|It was only ok.  I had better apps so I ended u delegating it.  Sorry I just dIdn't like it that much
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it does not have a pause button.  Sometimes you get interrupted but you have to let the time keep going.  I have played versions before where you could pause and it covers the board so you can't see it in pause mode.  Other than that, love all the different boards and ability to continue to shuffle until the end.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it and the kids love it! It's something we can enjoy together :-) They love the kung fu scrat game too!
B008Y79HE6|3.0|A good movie to watch whether family.<br />Action suspense thrill everything is there.<br />Director and actors are nice. I watched this movie 12 years ago while I was boy
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very fun get away from reality. Bunch of hots boys and girls killing demons. It is a definitely fun read.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a re-buy of a great movie.  We've showed this to all of our friends.  We love the values and morals espoused by this movie. The acting can sometimes be a little cheesy, but it doesn't matter.  The subject material is very timely for our day and age and the script and acting did a good job of portraying these values.<br /><br />Thanks so much for making this movie!
B0063IH60K|3.0|What can I say?  It's solitaire.  The card game you play when you are bored.  No bells and whistles.  I downloaded this because it was free and I am starting to load my Kindle with apps.  Not feeling like paying for games right now.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|this mouse is great! feel smooth and it has 3 easy buttons on the left of it where i can macro so much easier when i play games.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's different to navigate on my Kindle.  But it is expected just like navigating FB on my iPhone was different.  It's all good
193700788X|4.0|Dead Ever After wrapped up several story lines and patched broken fences. I didn't find anyone acting out of character and was happy to see all of Sookie's allies come to her rescue. The use of the claviel dor was a major catalyst and seems to have toned down the testosterone.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />I think Sookie made the right choice with Sam, who she had always found attractive and had formed a solid friendship with before any vampires walked into her life. In this last installment, Sookie has come full circle. Anyone who has read the books carefully would know that the romantic chemistry between Sookie and Sam was always there but superseded by the vampires.<br /><br />Sure, Eric was exciting and handsome, but he would never have been able to keep Sookie happy, especially when she started to reach her golden years. The fact that he admitted that he would eventually \\"change\\" her against her wishes proves that he was being completely selfish, which is very Eric. Yet, instead of seeing Eric as weak or out of character for not fighting for Sookie, consider that maybe, just maybe, he loved her enough to finally let her go.<br /><br />If you are a true fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, you have to read how the series ends and accept the fact that Sookie is where and with whom she wants to be.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is a great singer, the cd was received intact and good condition.  We have enjoyed listening to it.
B004FEFS5E|4.0|This is a great book, very clear and practical I learned a lot and would recommend it to any one
B009DH372Y|5.0|I really loved this!  I saw Queen a few times back in the seventies.  This brought back alot of great memories!
B00756GRUE|5.0|There is not enough good things I can say about this watch.  It is without a doubt the best dive watch I have ever had.  I wanted a bigger dive watch, but not Invicta big.  Those are just silly in my opinion because of their size.  The one is perfect.  All the subdials are dead on accurate.  If there is one thing I could change about this watch it would be the band.  I prefer a flat brushed metal look, this one is very shiny. It has nice weight to it.  Its also pretty thick.  I think this is by far the best back for your buck in the Dive Chrono category.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow this was an awesome game. I enjoyed the twists and turns.  It kept me guessing. I will pay it over and over again.
0765328321|5.0|This book answered a ton of questions I had about Halo. It covers the origins of the Master Chief and the SPARTAN IIs, as well as the fall of Reach (obviously). If you're looking to read the books in order, this is where you should start.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The size of this charger is great, it fits perfectly in my Toyota Tacoma truck.  I have an iPhone 5 and use it with this charger daily.  Prior to owning this charger I was using the Belkin iPhone 5 charger.  The aesthetics of the charger is pretty simple, it gets the job done.  I don't care too much about the looks as long as it does not get in my way of driving my vehicle and that it stays plugged in even if the car ride is bumpy.  This charger does all that and more.  My only small caveat about this charger is that I wish it had a status light like the Belkin to let me know that it's plugged in.  Other than that it is 100%.<br /><br />I normally have about a 15 minute drive to and from work where I utilize this charger.  On average I can get about anywhere from 30-50% of a charger on my iPhone 5.  I don't have an Android phone so I can't say how well it does for an Android but for Apple products it works great.  My son has an iPhone 4 and we sometimes both charge our phone from this charger.  I also have a blue tooth headset that I charge with the other USB port.  I have not had any problems since owning this charger.  Obviously long term going forward say 6-12 months and how long this charger lasts will convince me that this is a superior product to all other chargers.<br /><br />The good news is that I have heard nothing but great reviews regarding Anker products in general.  My next purchase will probably be their 20000mAh battery pack.  I look forward to reviewing that soon.<br /><br />This charger is geared towards those who need the most amount of charge from very little time since it puts out the max amount of power the iPhone can be charged at.  Nothing but good things so far.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|A 2012 American romantic comedy-drama in which the male lead, Bradley Cooper, has just been released from a psychiatric hospital and moved back in with his parents. Determined to win back his estranged wife, he meets recently-widowed sex addict Jennifer Lawrence, who also has some significant psychological problems. The two work together to achieve both Cooper's and Lawrence's (doing reasonably well in a dance competition) goals. En route, they resolve their psychological problems and end up getting married.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I want to see this cast in Dallas, Texas I love this CD and I love the cast.  I shouldn't complain the cast that came to Dallas where PHENOMENAL... I am HOOKED ON &#34;WICKED&#34;. I purchased all the books in the series absolutely phenomenal.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  One of those amazing stories that keep you hooked until the end.  twists and turns.  Unbelievable ending.  really good.
B003Y5H5FQ|1.0|This movie is inferior to the original Fright Night in every aspect except special effects.<br /><br />It contains NO horror, NO suspense, NO emotion.<br /><br />I have no feelings for the characters. I do not care when they are killed.<br /><br />Yes, the special effects are much better than those of the original film but I've seen them before. Colin Ferrell  can not save it.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, its Production Budget was $30 million.  Its domestic gross was $18,302,607. Obviously, it's a big flop in North America.
140525355X|5.0|This was a gift for my 5 year old grandson. He really enjoys reading the books himself and having them read to him. The books are small to carry around and enjoy anywhere. My son really loved these books when he was growing up and now the joy of reading these quick and fun books is being passed to the next generation.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|When I first watched its trailer, I thought it was a bad B movie. How wrong I was.<br /><br />- The action scenes are riveting, and intense.<br /><br />- It has some character's depth too.  For instance, the scene where Dredd had to decide if he was going to shoot the kid who was pointing a gun at him.<br /><br />- There are some interesting twists that caught me by surprise. For example, the shooting scene at the end.<br /><br />- I did not read the comic books that this movie was supposed to be loosely based on. Besides, I do not care if it's a faithful adaptation. I just want an enjoyable film.<br /><br />In short, it's entertaining and worth watching.
B000TU16GS|5.0|I may be retired, but I thoroughly enjoyed this exciting book and the entire series!<br />Did not want to put the books down and was genuinely sad to finish the last book.<br />Will reread them!<br /><br />Can be enjoyed by young teens to adults!
098555780X|5.0|I like this book because it is easy to understand and follow him and there are alot of cool bracelet ideas.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|This game is stupid. They dont ever put new dragons in, decorations, or anything else in for 3-47 weeks, this game needs to update that more often. I missed the solar eclipse, diamond, emerald, bouquet, coral, and salamander.
B009EHDU7U|2.0|Could not finish it. too far fetched. The improbability eventually became unbearable. The interaction of the main character and the US president did not ring true.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|If you love Jane Austen's England, you should be sure to watch &#34;Persuasion&#34; for a story of love thwarted then realized. the performances are grand.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|My only complaint for dragonvale is that you can only play it for about 10 or 15 minutes and then you need to wait several hours before you can play again and collect the money and breed more dragons.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I've read almost all the current books from Kathy Reichs and am looking forward to more from her in the future.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Love this show, so sad when Andy passed away,  He had great charisma, and Lucy Lawless is also excellent.  If you don't know already this is not child friendly due to the graphic violence, but that doesn't mean we adults can't enjoy it.
1616551151|5.0|I enjoyed the art and timeline in the book.  I wish there was more character concept art, but it was an interesting read.  I'm looking forward to volume 2.
B004TI1WME|2.0|So, I didn't buy this application, but I gave it a shot. While I saw pictures of where a title was given to each line of math done, I couldn't find anywhere to do that in the application. There really isn't much to miss either, so I'm just not sure. I would advise caution if you are going to buy this app, but if you can pick it up for free then try it out.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Update schedules and unexpected ads aside, this game is just plain fun. It's popular because it's awesome. Lighten up and enjoy!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It is quite addictive to play, but can be frustrating at times. It does seem that you will at times run into kill zones where there is no way to dodge an electrified area unless you were already in that path to start with. The perks you can buy makes the game pretty fun as well, and can't be unnoticed or really change up the game play of the game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Seems to give good info for weather day to day and future like that. I am glad to beable to use this on my kindle fire

B00BWJ91XK|5.0|My first movie for my Kindle. Saw it at theatre and could not way for it to come on DVD, but better for me I can take it with me everywhere on my Kindle.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very good book but a lot of it was not believable and actually got boring after a while.  But nonetheless a good story but reminds me of that movie &#34;pretty woman&#34;  not a likely actual event taking place.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how well this app is organized and the amount of information available. Very helpful. Multiple cities, weather events, weekly forecasts.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|Really excellent movie, that at times really keeps you guessing. It is hard to forget, because so many of the scenes are extraordinarily gut wrenching, but it is by far one of the best movies I've watched. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to see a real screwed up movie that brings out some of the most ugly truths of our society.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun . It's colorful an simple to do. My 8 year has it. He then got it for my 4 year old grand daughter . She loves it. I like it myself even.
B002GHHHL0|2.0|A bunch of enhanced sharks go AWOL at a scientific research facility, feasting on the flesh of mad scientists. That's the basic concept behind \\"Deep Blue Sea\\", starring Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel Jackson, among others. Poor Jackson is caught and eaten by two jumbo-sized makos in a classical scene. Otherwise, \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" is just too long and too boring. But then, I didn't like \\"Jaws\\" either. One thing's clear though: the unsung heroes of this story didn't have time ordering sushi, LOL.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|I was really looking forward to playing this game convinced that it would download but i was mistaken it tells me i have an error while trying to download this really makes me.mad becausr i have paid the money and cant install it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is the best game ever. It is really fun and never ever gets boring. It is really awesome.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I've been a fan of Vampire Weekend since their first album. I liked Contra but not as much as their self titled debut. I can't say where I rank this album just yet, but musically its a real step forward for them. The songs are reminiscent of Graceland era Paul Simon songs. It also seems like there is a constant existential theme that is both thought provoking and inspiring. The songs are as catchy as ever, and experimental at the same time (the chorus for Diane Young is insane).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have not had the time to see the movie, so I was happy to have been able to read the book. Very good.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I gave it 3 starts only because I really wanted to give a 2.5, so I rounded up.  The book seemed to just jump around a lot.  Too much.  I have nothing against who Sooking \\"ends up with\\" but....  it just seems really off (almost an involuntary eewww).  When did their relatin ship shift to romance?  I would never have matched the two.  And what the heck's up with Claude?  He's after Sookie for that!  The doesn't even like... that.  And isn't he homosexual?  What's the deal there?<br />Sorry, it just seems like the author was in a hurry to tie everything up and to tie up any loose ends.  Take it slower and write another book - don't just throw all of this at us at once.  Very confusing.  I had to go back and reread sections of it because of confusion....  Hopefully the new book coming out soon (I just preordered) will bring everything together....
B00A757EFW|5.0|I had bought the game for my grandson for xmas, as it was on his xmas list and was happy to have found it.
B0092MJOMW|5.0|It's classic thrash metal from the '80s!  It's f'n Slayer!  What more needs to be said? If you don't like it, f you.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|daughter in law has got me hooked. would like to get energy faster. if you know how just let me know. thanks
B006MW3UZW|5.0|But impossible to resist!  I suppose the changes in world culture have forever eradicated this lifestyle (with the exception being life in Buckingham Palace).  Nevertheless, it is a bit like watching a trainwreck in slow motion.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Works as advertised! Very pleased with order process all the way to delivery and I really like the more affordably priced accessories available for the D7100. This goes very well with my camera.
B00BQ1DATU|4.0|If you loved Fields, you'll love this one. Textured, ominous songs that reflect Jose's ability to create something that is dark and bright at the same time.<br /><br />The main reason I wanted to write the review is the Amazon download seems compressed beyond belief. I know I'm buying lower quality when I purchase by MP3 but I can't tell if it's just the recording or the download or what but it's worst than most albums I buy. That said, aim for the lossless or CD if you really do like the band. Let me know if it's any better too. With an album like this I want to hear all the instruments and the drums sound muddled, vocals not crisp, and the keyboards buzzing seems to take away from the whole experience. Just my two cents though. I might go and buy the CD now even after I purchased the MP3.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|loved this movie have several different versions of it, never disappointed in any of them including the none musical version
B00991TCOG|5.0|Very talent young lady....beautiful violin  music. My teenage daughter loves her music and we hope to see her in concert soon.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|liked this movie was a little unsure because of the different ratings from people, but found I did enjoy it
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This book delves deep into the old religions, I'm assuming Neil Gaiman did his research on this subject, this book is very interesting and weird in a way but very entertaining.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is an excellent movie for all ages.  My children love it and sing along with the music. Emmy Rossum is outstanding and has the perfect voice for the young character of Christine.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Paulo Coelho is a brilliant writer. He truly demonstrates and profound understanding of how life exists and evolves. The story is captivating and the ending was perfect! Thanks for writing this book!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.......Mr. Baldacci does not disappoint his readers!  He totally immerses you in his story-telling and keeps you in his environs, always making sure you don't want to stop reading.  I cannot wait for his next and future books.  It's always a treat.!!!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good spy-thriller!!!
B001GXYBY6|5.0|Such a fun movie to watch. Last time I watched it was on a 32&#34; tv with standard stereo sound on DVD. Now watching it in 1080p on a 55&#34; plama with 1200W 5.1 was mind blowing! The special effects and gripping story line was awesome! Good for adults and children.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of my all time favorite books is Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\". I loved the post apocalyptic mystery of that book and \\"Wool\\" reminds me of how I felt when I read that one. There's also something of The Hunger Games in Wool and Jules, one of the main characters in Wool reminds me greatly of Katniss. I'm near the end of the 550 pages but I am very conflicted at this point because I desperately want to know how it ends, but I really DON'T WANT IT TO END! There are so many mysteries and the anticipation of discovering what happens next is both delicious and a torment. I absolutely love this book, I can't recommend it enough and I'm so grateful to my daughter and her fiance' for recommending it. Nice work, Mr. Howey. I'll be downloading more by him as soon as I can bring myself to bite the bullet and finish Wool.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|I like this game and was excited to see it available for kindle. It is a good time management game. It is a good game for when you are sitting somewhere waiting. Graphics are good. Game play is good. Not a game for someone who wants continuous action. Get started and be a hero; protect the princess. Watch out for the bat!
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|I liked everything about this movie except two things: it's length and Ben Affleck's acting. Affleck's acting is emotionless. I actually can't believe he didn't give this part to someone who could show a wider range of emotions with his face.<br /><br />The length was also a concern. There were parts that didn't add to the story and didn't need to be there.<br /><br />If you can get beyond these things, it's an okay movie. It's a period piece, which is always fun to watch, and the story is interesting. There are some really good actors in this film. It perhaps got a little too much hype before I'd seen it because I was expecting something a little bigger overall.
0143122916|5.0|The book truly shows the strength of the human spirit. His journey was amazing and it is still continuing in his mind. The horrors of what is truly happening to the citizens of North Korea is revealed. It is hard to imagine how inhumane the conditions and mental anguish they are subjected to day to day still occurs while the rest of the world lives in relative comfort. A must read novel.
B00846REIS|4.0|Any time I start a book and can't put it down until it's finished it must be really good because I don't sit still long.I just read a trilogy which I will not name. But the two books I've read from this series were a lot better. I will be downloading more Sylvia Day to my Kindle.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This product came quickly and was just as described.  It's a fun movie for the whole family, from our grand-kids to us!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Works and is a little easier to use than just emailing the file to your printer (extra settings). I recommend.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|The product came just as described.  The whole family has been enjoying this movie, from the grand-children up to us.
0066620996|5.0|The title says enough!  Well worth more than I paid for!  Jim Collins is accurate in his account of Good vs. Great
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoy romance stories and this did not disappoint. I enjoyed the interaction between the characters as the story unfolded.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Great old time Hawaiian music from multiple sources all on one product. A winner if you ask me. Buy it.
B009K86D86|5.0|Must see this!! Good reasons to change the system and go organic. I strongly recommend you watch this if you don't have any idea where your food comes from.
0307120007|5.0|I had this little book for my sons when they were toddlers and they are 32 and 27 now.  My 1 year old granddaughter loves it.  The interaction is great.  Wonderful baby shower gift.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Definitely 5 Stars!<br />I was not disappointed in any song. I enjoyed them all. Each song has it's own twist and that's what makes this album worth checking out
B0049J3QNG|5.0|You must watch this movie...it's one for the ages. One of the few shows that improves as you watch it again and again and again!
B005LF9OCE|5.0|How I Met Your Mother never gets old.  Every episode if full of laughs and great writing complemented by amazing characters and the actors that nail the performance.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The author is amazing.  What a mind!  This story, like others of the author, causes one to stop and think and wonder!  Comparing and contrasting past and the present in a subtle way is a good reminder of how far we've come but to what good; at the same time, believing the simpler times of our past should be yearned.  Interesting book.
B0088T3B0G|5.0|Legend and who done it mystery classic.  A must see in the genre that is timeless.  I still recommend this move decades later.
B0017VG69U|5.0|If you've taken the time to invest the time and energy into buying at least a season of Star Trek, then you know this review is pretty much just the icing on the cake for you. The graphics have been splendidly remastered and touched up from their original release nearly half a century ago, and if you want a pretty looking collection to sit on your DVD shelves, then this is a perfect copy for you to pick up today. Don't forget to buy the first season beforehand, so you can watch hours of wonderful Star Trekkie goodness!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Reality check: people be crazy.  That doesn't mean they can't find love.  What an amazing story.  It has humor and surprise and romance in the most unexpected ways.  A rare treat
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is an adventure book that takes place in the future, but also in the past.  It's a brilliant mix science fiction and fantasy, and is chock full of pop culture references from the 1980s.<br />The story takes place thirty years from now when a new, more advanced version of the internet exists call \\"Oasis\\".  Oasis is a virtual reality experience that completely immerses the user in a world where anything can exist.  Where a person can be whoever they want, and where they can visit any place they can imagine.  It becomes the escape for all human beings from the reality of a world that has been corrupted and destroyed.  The designer of this Oasis platform is rich beyond all imagination and when he dies, he leaves his entire fortune and control of Oasis to the first person who can find a \\"Easter Egg\\" that he's hidden somewhere in the virtual Oasis.  This sparks a worldwide obsession with the search for the fortune.<br /><br />The book is absolutely addicting and It's near impossible to put down.  Cline's writing is clever, well researched, and very refreshing.  The story is completely original.  I read the book in three days, and I desperately wish there was a sequel.  This is an absolute A+ all the way.  Do not miss this one.  One of the year's best for sure!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|When you see movies from this time period you don't normally have a black male protangonist.  Having a change in hollywood is always nice.  You also get action and adventure.  Great movie.
1451668945|4.0|I am writing this review as a form of apology. Some time ago I commented that Ms. Higgins Clark should give it up, that she was no longer capable of writing good mysteries. Boy, was I wrong. This novel is probably as good as anything that she has written in years. Then, why only 4 stars? I have a problem with a major premise on who the murderer is. It didn't make any sense to me. I am not going to say any more , for fear of giving out a huge spoiler. So, just enjoy this read.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|It's like Robin Hood and Batman rolled into one.  Of course there is the eye candy for the ladies but enough mystery and action that men will enjoy as well.  A favorite in our house.
193700788X|1.0|I was so disappointed with this last book.  I just don't have the words.  It's like a totally different person wrote this, and there were so many inconsistencies.  I'll probably never read any of her books again.  I hated this book!  What a waste....
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Bond is back and better than ever adding a personal dimension through a story of his past.  Can't miss this next installment of the classic series.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Playing it on my Sony Playstation, and discs are clean and played for the first time. No issues with playstation.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Ralph was being what he was made to be but shunned for it.  He overcame and ended up helping others do the same.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Game Loft does it again with this one. Keep em coming. Good adventure..Lots of treasure. Awesome graphics. Good story line.
B0039NK0LE|4.0|If you like awkward humor this is the movie for you.  It made me cringe but I couldn't look away.  I died laughing more than once.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|The video came in perfect condition and I received right away.  Thank you very much! I enjoy the movie very much
B009NX3TB2|5.0|This will make you see life from another lens. Challenges across the spectrum and across the age spectrum allow for a rich experience.  Can't go wrong with this movie.
B004GYY714|5.0|The reason I wanted an app like this is so I can hear French radio, since I am studying French and plan to visit there soon.  It is great to spend a few minutes every day listening so that I hear French speakers talking and then I can see how much I understand.  I really like it!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Bravery in action.  Saving lives against all odds using a unique plan.  Acting and the flow of the story was superb.
B008F2AKUA|5.0|I like to play rock and roll on my phone when I'm walking, and this album fills the bill and is a great addition to my rock and roll playlist!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|To know this family survived something like this make me believe in miracles.  A family of 5 finding each other admit such chaos and against such odds.  Offers life a new perspective.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Although I have not spent a lot of time with this yet, I really like the ability to do word processing on my Kindle Fire.  So far, it is great!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room was very well done. I liked the graphics and some of the puzzles had me thinking for a minute. Looking forward to more games like this.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Nice work to all. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes hidden object games. The graphics were great and the site map was very helpful for navigating through. throw game.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A great combination of comedy and tragedy. Well developed characters .The fact based background surely was a thought provoking premise. I would highly recommend this fast reading novel.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read this book to see what all the hype was about and the fact that it was controversial. I will say that it has its moments and was a fun read. Brings fun thoughts to mind but isn't all that controversial.<br /><br />Most certainly worth the read, fun.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book could hardly put down during second half.  Slow starter but really worth the read. I would recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A very captivating novel that was hard to put down.  I loved the surprising twist at the end & the overall story was rather gripping.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I downloaded it and it worked for a few weeks. now when I open the app it freezes  on the score board and won't load.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the best game ever everybody should download this app. I know because i just now downloaded this but I've played it on my brothers phone
B003OF3R0S|5.0|NIGHTMARE is a great album from AVENGED SEVENFOLD!!! All the songs rocks like the title track, NATURAL BORN KILLER, BURIED ALIVE, DANGER LINE and WELCOME TO THE FAMILY!!!! AVENGED´s sound is melodic but HEAVY, the singer is great and NIGHTMARE may be their best album.....CITY OF EVIL and self titled one are great too....TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Never used it yet! Don't know how!  Maybe some time in the future I'll get the information I need to use it. I need it too!
B005F9CPG8|3.0|bought one, no art work...returned for another, still no art work..as usual amazon was more than helpful, took both back...retuned my money....some favorites not here...I guess they were not #1s
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Thanks for setting it up as you have,  great job!  Saves me time, I hate shopping!  Great thought has gone into making it as pleasant as it can be, thankz again!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved Lord of The Rings, the book and the movies, but The Hobbit is probably my favorite book of all times. I was happy to hear it was finally going to be a movie directed by Peter Jackson. The movie did a pretty good job sticking with the original story line, but a lot more has been added. I think the extra stuff came from his other books and writings, which I haven't read. I mean they're making it into three films and after the first movie we're nearly halfway over with the book, The Hobbit's, story. They added the white orc, I think that was necessary. I feel like the goblins were enough trouble. But overall, I still love this movie. Gollum scared the bejeezus out of me and I knew how that was going to go down already. Still nearly wet my pants... But I'd definitely recommend renting it if not buying it!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's so cool I like iron man and fighting but wish you could walk and run and use buttons to control your man
B004X80QNG|1.0|The interface on this app does not resemble a physical planner. There are<br />no colored tabs in the sides of the app pages. The screenshots are 80% of why I purchased the app because it looked very used friendly. I wanted a planner in an app form. I tried checking the settings to see if there was anything I was missing in changing the page format and I saw nothing.<br />I'm open to help, but until then it gets 1 star.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This game crashes CONSTANTLY on the 1G Kindle Fire. It's a fun game, they even got me to spend money to move through it faster, but it does NOT PLAY WELL with the KF.  Takes 2 minutes to load each time (always with the 'Mystery Manor is not responding' Force Close or Wait dialogue box).  This hanging also happens at various times throughout the game play.  Then, almost always after completing a successful high value room search (after it has taken the 'cost' in energy from you up front)it crashes prior to putting the items you won into your inventory or increasing your experience points - effectively stealing what you should have won.  Lately it has been freezing my KF completely, requiring a hard reboot to fix the problem.  Having this happen multiple times per day is infuriating.  I give up!!! I was also getting bored with getting the same 'rewards' whenever it did not crash - low value misc items that are not collection items - and rarely what you are needing at the time, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER again.  This happened a lot, even when I was using supposed 'charms' to increase my chances of having the game 'drop' collection items and bringing helpers with me into rooms.  I have come to believe that this game is specifically designed to get you to spend money as many ways as you possibly can to move forward at a reasonable pace.<br /><br />I did contact support.  They responded with canned email responses that said they would look into it - and then promptly closed the case with a 'solved' status.  KF is probably a platform they do not care very much about, so buyer beware...<br /><br />I am DONE with the frustration and will NEVER purchase another game from GameInsight.  I think that although they have come up with an intriguing game that could be a lot of fun if it worked as it should, that they are deceitful and disrespectful of their paying customers.
1476734941|4.0|This book will help me with tailoring my dietetic needs. It is a simple book about a simple plan. I appreciate that.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This book was entertaining in a weird way, but it took death and murder very lightly.  The people in the book also got away with some preposterous activities that no one in real life could manage.  It's like a slightly violent and somewhat silly cartoon for adults.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I read the book and decided to rent the movie. To my surprise they were both great. Although the movie didn't follow the story line, the acting was superb. Don't miss this one
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Waited this long to watch it. I can see why people got worked up when it was cancelled. Funny, serious, intelligent, and Nathan fillion. What more is there to say?
B00BJUQP4A|5.0|Delightful photographic essay on a boy and his dog.......on all manner of things!  Very witty, endearing, intriguing and wonderful.  I love Maddie!
1609613937|5.0|Someone stopped me once while I was carrying a copy of The Starch Solution. The person said something that indicated she assumed the book was meant to help the reader eat less starch.  Wrong.  And I love the irony. The cover image of a baked potato is appetizing enough to get me thinking of food shopping, chopping, and cooking, looking for the pot at the end of the rainbow.  John McDougall is a magnificent and reliable guide to the radical health benefits of eating a whole foods, plant-based diet low in fat and sugar.  But don't take it from me.  Consider the testimony of T. Colin Campbell, a Cornell University scholar of nutrition and author of the bestselling landmark brief on this way of eating, [[ASIN:1932100660 The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health]] (2005) and its sequel, [[ASIN:1937856240 Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition]] (2013).  Campbell effusively praised McDougall: &#34;His nutrition and health knowledge is phenomenal, greater than any other doctor I've met and greater than any of my nutrition colleagues in academia.&#34; (p. 329 of The China Study).  That's what I call street cred.  The Starch Solution packs a brisk, lively, and easy-to-read survey of what's wrong with the standard American diet including animal products, and what's right about eating plants in whole form with no added oils, low sugar, and watch the salt.  Actually it's worth noting that McDougall is a bit more relaxed about salt than other authors in this ilk, who I also like very much, including the people behind [[ASIN:1936661381 Everyday Happy Herbivore: Over 175 Quick-and-Easy Fat-Free and Low-Fat Vegan Recipes]] (2011) and [[ASIN:1615190619 Forks Over Knives - The Cookbook: Over 300 Recipes for Plant-Based Eating All Through the Year]]) (2012).  Besides excellent discussions of health and food, the recipes include a bunch of real winners.  Not everything I've tried has been fabulous, but some dishes have been, including Broccoli Bisque (p. 273) that now is a regular item in my home, and Tunisian Sweet Potato Stew (p. 277) that was my first love in a vegan stew -- and helped turn me vegan!  What's more, the recipes strike a nice balance midway on a scale of simplicity to complexity in preparation -- time-conscious and not requiring high skills, but enough there to make the dishes come out delicious. Honestly, not every recipe I've tried has been a winner in my family, but everything has been well worth trying, and some recipes have been prepared eagerly in repetition.  In short, this is a fabulous all-in-one book.
B005OZE9SA|3.0|My 3 stars is because When I first tried using the product simply connecting it to my computer it would blue screen my computer. don't know why never figured it out. Just after the 10 retry and restart it worked so eh. It still will crash my computer every so often but I haven't started any work since i'm connecting it so I don't lose anything.<br /><br />Also customer service sucks.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Ever clever twist and turn will have you marvelling, jealous, and loving the main man in this story. A tale of what it is to truly live. Enjoy the ride!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|So glad to have found this app!  I was seriously upset that google is doing away with my beloved Reader.  Well, Feedly is my new best friend! It so easy to use, especially easy to link up your reader account and I love how customizable it is.  You will not be disappointed!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really like this game the graphics are great. The story is great enjoyed playing it. So worth the money.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Nice tidy ending but not the usual fun fast read I have come to expect from the Stackhouse series.  I easily guessed the ending after the first chapter.
0385737947|4.0|I loved this book. I liked it bc this was my type of book kinda like the Hunger Games. it was for younger kids i see and i am 19 but i still enjoyed reading it. I've passed it one to my little sister and i started on book two. also it was in perfect condition so i'm glad i purchased from this seller.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|This is a nice game, but it's soo similar to ones I've played before...the gems are a bit big so my eye doesn't scan as fast...i play it when i have no other games to play...
B005HJU7HA|5.0|If you like mysteries and have time to forget daily problems, this is a good read. I like it and am currently watching Elementary on Tv. I'm a fan of both. Sir Arthur draws an excellent picture in your mind as you read through his stories. Having only seen one or two black and white movies, I find this book very entertaining.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Great to have extra caps around when you are changing lens. These are high quality and fit for F or DX lenses.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|These were the best books ever...kept me on edge and I couldn't stop reading. I read all 3 books in 6 days! Now I can't wait to see the movies!
B00846REIS|4.0|Really liked the book. Could be longer. Great for quick reading as long as you aren't looking for something really deep
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is my favorite pass time game that gives me a bit of a challenge. I love it. Really fun game
0670026603|5.0|There's a whole waiting list of family & friends in line to read this book as I couldn't stop raving about it!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I think this is a awesome game but I won't download for me it does not work for me and I watched pewdiepie play it so yeah
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|Other than the fact that the picture did not fill the screen, I thought the re-production was excellent.  I firmly believe everyone should experience Schindler's List sometime in their lives.  It surely is a poignant story told well.  The movie is probably as good as the book , which I have read.  That says a lot for the movie.  Thanks for putting out the 20th anniversary edition.  John Williams ' music is spectacular!

B00BJS7LHC|5.0|This might be my favorite of the Quentin Tarantino films, which is a strong statement considering Pulp Fiction, but this one is very close.  It's very long, but I don't know what I would suggest cutting to make it shorter.  Over the top gore, snappy dialougue, and very good casting.  I even like DiCaprio in this movie, and he often gets on my nerves.
0984183523|4.0|This book is the best book for preparing you for the case interview structure and process. It is the most insightful book about case interviews I've ever read (I have read a lot...) However I'm giving 4 stars and not 5 because of following reasons:<br /><br />1. The book doesn't make you familiar with basic business knowledge. Victor Cheng is likely assuming the reader already knows. However, it would be helpful to have a summary of e.g. the three major ways to evaluate an investment and how they work, Supply & Demand curve and mechanics, major fixed and variable costs.<br /><br />2. The book doesn't include practice cases. At 10 standard business cases with insights, solutions and problem trees. You can buy it though from his homepage<br /><br />3. More visualisations would be helpful to understand his structure of thoughts. Especially when using sample cases.<br /><br />In summary. This book to read is a must, but for the three particular areas, other resources shall be used to be prepared for a case interview.

0812452240|5.0|I have already read IT and loved it. I was looking for a hardcover version of the book because, honestly, the mass market paperback version is kind of crap looking. The cover is just awful. Looking through Amazon, I came across this really cool looking cover. And it was a hardback! The price was decent, too. Sold!<br /><br />Little did I know that I would be getting a mass market version size book, just with a hard cover on it. It's just kind of...odd. I was really hoping for a regular size hardback of this book but those seem hard to find, at least for a reasonable price. But, really, it's my own fault for not looking at the product description and reading more into it.<br /><br />Oh well, still love the book!

B004QOB8SY|5.0|If you can't find any other reason to watch this show, do yourself a favor and watch it for Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. With the first season under their belts, the two have even more chemistry than before. This is evident from the first episode, A Scandle in Belgravia, when the two are laughing their asses off while sitting on a couch, with Sherlock wrapped in nothing but a white sheet. The stories are great, with good mystery, don't get me wrong. But this show wouldn't work, and probably wouldn't be moving into it's third season, without these two to knock their respective roles out of the park.<br /><br />While going on about the two main stars, Andrew Scott is no slouch as Moriarty. It took me a little bit to get used to how he speaks, which is kind of over the top, but it fits the role of mad genius perfectly. He is quite the match for Sherlock, especially in the awesome finale, The Reichenbach Fall&#34;. The character and actor are quite brilliant in the episode.<br /><br />Basically, the short of it is: watch the show! My personal favorites, out of the two seasons, are:<br /><br />1: A Study in Pink<br />2. The Great Game<br />3. The Reichenbach Fall

014312336X|5.0|This is a fascinating story of a true-life crime committed in the last days of old Peking as the threat of invasion, war and revolution spread fear amongst the Chinese and foreign inhabitants of the city.<br /><br />Author Paul French has researched the murder of 19-year-old Pamela Werner thoroughly and tells the tale well. Was Pamela an innocent schoolgirl or an independent and rebellious young woman bent on sampling some of the excitements Peking could offer? Was she murdered by a maniac or by someone closer to home? French shows how the investigation developed, first through official channels of the Chinese police and the British Legation, then when that led to nothing, through a private investigation funded by Pamela's father. And French's solution, when it comes, is as convincing as it is horrifying.<br /><br />While the story of the murder is intriguing enough in itself, the added interest of the book comes from the light French sheds on the city of Peking at this time of fear and change. He is scathing about the diplomatic cover-ups and corruption that hampered the investigation as the British Legation tried to stamp out any word of scandal that might reflect on their community. He shows the contrast between life within the gated foreign quarter, with its dances and tea parties, and life outside in the Badlands, a place where vice of all kinds was available for a price, a place where some of the ultra-respectable foreigners led a very different life. French gives a clear account of the political picture of the time as the Japanese surrounded the city prior to invasion, as the ideas of fascism and communism were spreading throughout the world, as war seemed an ever more likely prospect.<br /><br />A very well written book about a dark episode in a fascinating period - highly recommended.<br /><br />NB This book was provided for review by Amazon Vine UK.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|If you are looking for an over-the-top exciting read about navy seal missions, this is not your book. However, it is a very interesting read into the lives of the seals. You won't hear secrets or complex details, but you get enough of a taste of the complexity and the depth of these guys' lives, missions and trainings. The writing is casual and imperfect, which is to be expected since it is written by a seal, and actually adds to the authenticity of the book. Worth a read, but it wont blow your mind.

B00BF11STU|4.0|She was very credible as the CIA agent doing all the tedious work to hunt down Bin Laden.  The climax which was only 5-10% of the movie was difficult to see on my computer and some of it seemed to shorten parts to make it all fit.  I would have liked to see some sense of  remorse from the trained killers (soldiers and cIA people)  Yet it is easy to focus on who this man was and what he did.  Vengence is a frightening part of our pyche.
0439023513|5.0|Recently I finished the last book of the Hunger Games. I liked the ending, but I don't think anyone could say they loved the ending. The world consists of oppressors and the oppressed so naturally things would go towards war. From other reviews some people may have expected lighter events happening, but I'm glad the author stuck to her ideas of what war can really do to people and the society. I also noted some reviews dislike Katniss. I admit she was hospitalized for most the book. I saw her descent into \\"just giving up on her life\\" since the second book. She was coming unhinged and I think the author did a great job showing this has a gradual change since the first book really. Also, it seems there are some comments criticizing her choices etc. Katniss isn't a character you should expect to make morally righteous choices. She often chooses to act on her anger and to take vengeance. She's imperfect, but I felt like she was real as opposed to Peeta the idealist. Yet everyone needs a person like Peeta around, as Katniss herself said many times. Peeta is a great character and all, but I could relate to Katniss more. Another criticism I read was the book is too violent for young people. I couldn't disagree more with those remarks. I believe young people should read on this topic, especially young people who enjoy the freedom and relative safety in places they live. They have to realize that other young people are not as lucky and live in war torn areas every day. As for the ending I thought it was the best for Katniss considering what she lost. There's pain there, but she has very precious people with her at the ending. The ending was a little short on how she spent her life, but that's all I needed to know. Finally, I think one of the main themes of the Hunger Games trilogy is to face the reality, the truth in the face, fight it or embrace it, but don't ignore it. Katniss represents this I think. The Capital is a symbol of illusion and decadence and passive acceptance of what is wrong. This is my personal opinion, so if you disagree you can leave a comment. However I'm not going to respond because I think trying to change an opinion of another on a work of fiction is quite futile. Thanks!of what is wrong.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Gee, so much hype about this book, how could I not read it? But now that I'm finished, I can't undrstand the hype...<br /><br />The story began well, with enough intrigue to make me wonder what the heck was wrong with this picture. And the language of the story (the writing itself) was very pleasing to follow.  But about half way through, after we discovered what was really happening with Amy, the plot became (in my opinion) implausible and a little silly.  The mystery started off seriously enough but then deviated into a soap opera tale of !megalomaniacal treachery! None of the potential plot lines from first part of the story were developed into anything diabolical ( e.g. the purchase of the gun, Nick's father's strange behavior at the housewarming, Amy's cryptic friendship with Noelle)--most of the mystery was dropped altogether--and then all of a sudden I was forced to accept an unbelievable (& I mean really not believable) turn of events unfitting of the characters thus far developed.  It was not like &#34;Wow! I didn't see THAT coming!!&#34; , it was more like &#34;No way! It wouldn't (or shouldn't) happen like that!!&#34;<br /><br />Another issue for me, that I realized about 3/4 of the way through, was that the main characters, Nick and Amy, were falsely developed. The first part of the story portrayed them, in depth, to be certain personalities, but then those were discarded in exchange for the more wicked traits of the revealed characters. I understand that this was supposed to be the big twist, but the second-part Nick and Amy were never really fleshed out to make them believable.  I felt as if I never had a grasp on Nick's character at all--was he a handsome streetwise literary? A small-minded, small-town dullard? A scheming, twisted match for his sociopathic wife? How was Amy ever beautiful and gracious, if she was only ever calculative and malevolent? And at what point did they become poison for each other? I was never made to understand how their relationship became a &#34;sick, toxic Möbius strip&#34;:  that would suggest long-standing dysfunction, but that part of their story was not written here.  I felt that, in order to appreciate the grand turn-of-events, I had to blindly accept that Amy, and to an extent, Nick, were, and had always been, evil.<br /><br />I have many other small issues with the plot, and was perplexed by the resignation of the ending, but suffice it to say that a story with great potential for intrigue and complexity veered off to become a typical bland, superficial, best-seller-list mystery (in my opinion).

0316228532|2.0|I was a big fan of the Harry Potter series.  I was looking forward to this book when it was announced.  However, I have to say it was a real dud.  I finished the book, but when I closed it, I asked myself what was the point?  The only decent person in the city of Pagford died in the first few pages!!  If this is Rowling's outlook on life, I find that very sad.  To say that people are so selfish is disturbing.  Everyone is only looking out for themselves!!  It is a real twisted look on \\"reality\\".  Some of the reviews called this real life.  I have to say I disagree.  This is definitely not the life I know.  Maybe you have to be English to understand.

B00ANGICRE|5.0|Movie: 5 Stars  Extras: 2.5 Stars<br /><br />During the 50th Annual American Atheists Convention in Austin, Texas, I had the good fortune to run into Dr. Darrel Ray, author of [[ASIN:0970950543 Sex & God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality]]. After I explained my situation to him (somewhat similar to that of the movie's main character), he graciously took time to have a private conversation with me and offered some possible solutions to my issue.  One suggestion he made was to watch \\"The Sessions\\", as according to him it gets a lot right about sexual therapy.<br /><br />The movie is based on the true story of journalist Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes), who as a child became paralyzed from the neck down by polio.  At the age of 38 he decided it was time to lose his virginity, and encouraged by a sympathetic priest (William H. Macy) he ends up hiring sex therapist Cheryl Cohen-Green (Helen Hunt).  At first their relationship is somewhat awkward, but as time goes on they develop a closeness that awakens jealousy in Cheryl's husband (Adam Arkin).<br /><br />The performances of all the principles are uniformly excellent, with Mr. Hawkes and Ms. Hunt as the standout actors of the ensemble.  Their interactions were so frank and intimate I almost felt like an intruder while watching them.  After the movie ended, I checked out the sparse but informative extras, although this was one film where a commentary was sorely missed.  However, at least I was able to purchase Kindle books by the real Mark O'Brien: [[ASIN:B009VNXVXA How I Became a Human Being: A Disabled Man's Quest for Independence (Wisconsin Studies in Autobiography)]] and Cheryl Cohen-Green: [[ASIN:B00A2N81BU An Intimate Life: Sex, Love, and My Journey as a Surrogate Partner]].<br /><br />I was also able to find an online article written by Mark O'Brien about his time with Ms. Cohen-Green, and the movie hews fairly close to his actual experience, although some dramatic and relational liberties were taken by the filmmakers.  I'm thankful that Dr. Ray recommended \\"The Sessions\\" to me, although I'm not sure I'm ready to hire a sex therapist at this stage in my life.  But I'm glad the option exists, and that this movie was able to portray the controversial subject of sexual therapy in such a dramatic yet accessible manner.  Recommended.I'm thankful that Dr. Ray recommended \\"The Sessions\\" to me, although I'm not sure I'm ready to hire a sex therapist at this stage in my life.

B004I8WD7S|2.0|This product looks good and seems to have suitable protection (although I didn't use the screen protector), but it has one major flaw.  The flaw is that the edges of this case are not smooth, but instead quite \\"sharp\\" hard plastic.  I keep my phone in my back pants pocket, and the hard edges therefore are constantly rubbing against (and wearing through) the pants fabric.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's likely a non-issue if you carry the phone in other ways, but the case just didn't work for me for that reason.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This movie tried it's best to demonstrate the teachings of reincarnation and how we are interconnected with each other.  Karma is really a bitch.  It proves the age old saying,&#34;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you&#34;.  I understand the teachings of reincarnation even though I do not believe in it.  The movie does teach a great moral.  It is a moral that true across the board of religions.  Wether you accept it or not, it is still there in your face.
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|After my fancy two-piece phone case began coming open on its own, I set off to find a better case.  This one was certainly one of the cheapest, and looked like it would do the job, so I figured - why not?<br /><br />Mainly I needed a case for grip (because a naked iPhone in all its smooth metallic industrial glory is very difficult to hold securely) and as basic protection against drops.  The case fulfills both needs - excellent grip and basic shock absorption when dropped on hard surfaces.  There are definitely bigger, bulkier protective cases, but I didn't want those because they are, well, bigger and bulkier.<br /><br />As a bonus, the smooth edges and soft material of this case means I can put it in my back pants pocket and not worry about the case wearing holes into the fabric.<br /><br />The case isn't perfect; it's so grippy that sometimes it's hard to get out of my pocket, and the soft rubbery nature of the material means the case will slip off more often than you'd like, but on the whole it does the job and at a price that can't be beat.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love her in ANYTHING! This was a real treat to see her in this classic tale. three words required?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|some levels were too hard from the one that preceeded it. but overall, an amazing and very addictive game! keep up the good work!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This app is fun. You can play along with the keys or make your own tunes, record them, etc. Lots of fun while you're waiting for the kids, etc.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. Best bingo on kindle. I play it everyday.wish I would win more but so excited when I can hit bingo. Love to come and find new things added. Check it out you'll get hooked too.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Very cute graphics, easy tap controls.  Challenging enough for adults.  It's very addictive trying to fill your catalog with all the different types of fish and plants.  The one downfall I have is that after the first few levels, it takes a LONG time to level up and attract new fish.  Feeding the plants also takes a lot more algae.  Seems like all you do it tap, tap, tap for hours!  You can travel to your registered friends reefs and check out their reef.  Had lots of fun with granddaughter and mother who are ages 7 to 76!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I liked this book, as well as Flynn's other novel Gone Girl, but foundd some of the plot twists a bit farfetched. I think with her compelling characters and ability to capture flyover country in all it's dreariness and desperation, the books would actually be better without the &#34;wow&#34; factor of highly unlikely, overwrought endings. However, millions of readers disagree. Note I gave four stars, so obviously Dark Places is a good read. There were some stomach-churning details involving both animal and human cruelty that I had to zip past. I get why they're in there, but don't want to read them.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|The receiver gave great reviews, I haven't seen this version of it but I trust its good, because he isn't that easy to please.
B00466HN6S|5.0|GREAT PURCHASE THE GRAND KIDS LOVED THIS MOVIE GREAT VALUE FOR THE PURCHASE WILL BE MORE MOVIES IN THE FUTURE
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Best TV Series EVER !!!!!!!!!  I chose it because we had totally misses watching Season 10.  I just gets better and better.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game it's awesome and I just defeated crymson dynamo I woupt his button and defeated 250 bad guys.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This is a great app for catching up on the news and all things social!  I absolutely love it.  Great!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Thank you for making this such a bright colorful and fun game for children.  I have to read the information to my 4 year old great nephew, but he knows how to navigate.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|This app may be fine for kids, but it is very simple to complete the construction and simply not very much fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Everything that was fun about Temple Run but with more variety.  More level variety, more power ups, more fun!  Perfect kind of game for when you want to kill a few minutes, or hours.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm not usually one to buy games, but Amazon gave me 500 coins so I thought I'd give The Room a shot. I'm really glad I did! I was impressed with the graphics, and even more so with the story. This game is complex and challenging without being impossible. I'll definitely be purchasing the next one!
B0086700CM|5.0|Great fun for a free game, a lot of enjoyment without having to make in-game purchases.  Overwell a very good game.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Om Nom is unfathomly adorable, and every single new Om Nom is veteran the last. I can't wait for more! Luv the game so much!!!!! :P
B00BF2RTO2|3.0|We're spoiled by the sharpness and audio quality of Blu-Ray, so this DVD will naturally not compare well to other recent concert Blu-Ray discs.<br /><br />The audio sounds pretty decent, given what it is.<br /><br />Top marks for the concert, however.<br /><br />Worth buying for the die-hard fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games you can ever have. the only problem is same people have a hard timeupdateing the game.my friend and my cousin all ways want to play sudwaysufer because the cant get it on the nook .
B009VL28W2|4.0|As great visually and sonically as you can expect from Blu-Ray.  Just like being there, and I was.<br /><br />Metallica are bigger than they have ever been, however, the long-time fans will still miss their best days when they were at their artistic peak.  This was between 20 and 25 years ago.
B003JHKORK|5.0|Awesome modern movie that makes strong connections to Greek Myths.  This is fun to watch withy students after completing our Greek Mythology unit.
B00030590I|3.0|I don't want to compare this movie, Hero (Ying xiong) with other classic martial arts films, but this one was made in areas of stunning scenery, and the arrow scenes were fabulous.  The plot is one of the stories associated with the forging of a unified China - Our Land.<br /><br />The slow motion, floating, artsy fight scenes, however, are wearing thin for me.  Just saying.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Depeche Mode has been one of my faves since the 80's!  The CD is not there best, but it is so very well done music and if you liked them before you will be happy to add this to your collection!
B008P9M614|5.0|We loved this series. And I am glad we waited until the entire series was available in one boxed set.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This CD is a great compilation of some JT's best music to date.  I highly recommend it because its not bubble gum... It's  very well done!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child's second book in the Jack Reacher series is every bit the page turner as the first. Great read!
B0055PGUYU|2.0|I enjoyed this book and ordered it since the reviews suggested it would teach us much. We all have habits, to a certain degree. How do our habits--and the habits of others--- help inform our productivity--or help push us toward success? What habits, if any, might impede the enjoyment of life? Well,  I found the &#34;lessons&#34; were somewhat shallow and forgettable, nothing riveting seemed to push through the narrative. I enjoyed it--but could I offer up a few cogent points as to exactly what the author's takeaway might be relating to business and life habits? I'm afraid not--this was more like a magazine article one reads in an inflight magazine-- perfectly fine. But ultimately somewhat forgettable.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I'm sure I'm biased because I'm around Tina Fey's age and live in Philadelphia (area where she grew up). So much of what she said that was funny about her life wasn't because she's famous, it's because it's relateable.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|The consistent best seller has been recommended to me by many and I finally downloaded it via Kindle. I thought the tale was fine--nothing terribly awe inspiring but certainly pleasant, the narration is not replete with exciting imagery and the ending was--for me--no surprise. If the book had not received the degree of &#34;hype&#34; that it has, my sense is that I likely would have placed it in the totally forgettable category.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|This veteran model is the ruling monarch of the studio-monitor level headphone kingdom. You may search high and low, pay a king's ransom for trendy, colorful set of cans, but you will NEVER (let me repeat it for the sake of clarity:) EVER find better more transparent and true-to-the-source set of phones.<br /><br />Easy to use and wear, interchangable earpads and cords make it a practical choice as well. The sound is lively, extremely detailed, no frequency-range is too inflated or &#34;beautified&#34; yet the sound is never 'cold&#34; or to technical. They are a pleasure to listen to and are somehwat more forgiving than other monitor style sets in cases of not-so-great-quality sources (e.g.: older MP3 files with lower sampling rate; audio tapes or radio quality sources).<br /><br />Use it for recording or prodduction, audiophile level listening or just fun.<br />Less suitable for DJ work or for social settings seince it is not closed-back and leaks sound.<br /><br />Given its price - it is one of the best value-per-money headphones in the market right now.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a good brain teaser.  It really makes you think.It is also good brain exersize. Kids will really enjoy as well as adults.
1936850028|4.0|What a fun read about an epic event! Some books that portray sporting events require an energy bar or cup of strong coffee to help you finish them. Not this one. If anything, it only energizes me to get out there! The poignant interview with \\"the legend\\" Dave Landgraf was inspiring and sad knowing that Dave left us far too soon. Rhein's experience, thrown in with ample humor, made this a relaxing and really fun read. . . until I got to the part about \\"Bitch Hill.\\" The description was far too good and having experienced that pitch, I found my heart rate accelerating and my breathing coming in full draws!  So whether you are a seasoned Birkie veteran, a newbie, a wanna-be or even a happy vicarious skier, this book is a joy to read. Finishing this book might not be the accomplishment of finishing a Birkie, but it will make you smile and want more.
B000001GX8|5.0|There were a number of great recordings of Mozart's \\"Figaro\\" in the 1950's and 1960's, and this is one of them -- Kleiber/Siepi and Guilini/Schwarzkopf are two others -- and I have heard great things of the Solti/Te Kanawa recording of a few years later, but I don't own it.  Any of these needs to be heard in the context of Rene Jacobs's recording with Veronique Gens and Simon Keenlyside as the Almavivas: it is fully au courant with period style, very well sung and conducted, and has the most imaginative continuo playing for the recitatives that I've ever heard.  After hearing Jacobs, any of the earlier ones I've mentioned will seem a bit plain, but that's no reason to dismiss them.  This one of Bohm's has a stellar cast, all voices fine and distinctive -- Janowitz (sometimes accused of being merely a lovely voice) is expressive as well as beautiful here; Prey is a saturnine and sharp Figaro, solid at the bottom of his range and singing with fine diction;  Mathis is a lively Susanna in both recitative and concerted music; Fischer-Dieskau is an imperious Count, singing well and totally inhabiting his not-at-all likeable character; and Tatiana Troyanos is a sensationally good Cherubino, her voice in lovely condition and fully alive to the dramatic demands of her part.  The balance of voices and orchestra is just about perfect -- listen to Peter Lagger's \\"Vendetta\\" aria to see what I mean -- and the sound overall is fine.  I wouldn't be without Kleiber, Guilini, Jacobs, or this one -- or the Glyndebourne slightly abridged one conducted by Gui and with Jurinac as the Countess.  You can't have too many Figaros -- perhaps Mozart's finest.
B00371XIJE|5.0|This is the kind of movie the entire family can mine for gold. A man and his dog, with the reluctant wife following behind. This film explores friendships, loyalty, devotion and even ethics. I can think of nothing I didn't like in this movie.<br /><br />It will work your emotions, but in a good and noble way.
B004TI5N38|3.0|It was a smooth read I am in love with his all in approach.  I read the follow up already and waiting for the new one.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|There are several surprises in this movie. A pilot with a drug problem is just the beginning. A pilot faced with an impossible emergency situation who saves lives. It is well done, believable and just a great movie.
0345522478|4.0|\\"Hounded\\" (Del Rey, $7.99, 289 pages) isn't going to make you rush to Goodreads to post about the most spectacular new piece of urban fantasy ever written - but it will deliver 289 pages of likeable characters, solid plotting and a sure narrative voice.<br /><br />The setup is this: A long-lived Druid (think many centuries) has settled in modern Arizona to dodge his various enemies among the gods, witches, demons, werewolves and ghouls that hover just beneath our everyday consciousness. His idyll is interrupted by the Celtic god of love's desire for his powerful magical sword, and complications ensue involving other gods, witches and even nosy neighbors - and of course his faithful Irish wolfhound Oberon.<br /><br />\\"Hounded\\" is simply lots of fun, and Kevin Hearne walks the narrow path between too flippant and too dark with a deft authorial touch.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I am not sure if I will remember much about this book in a year or two, but it was a really fun read, and I recommend it strongly.  The story is not exactly believable -- a centenarian with a stolen suitcase of cash, a petty criminal, a well-educated dropout, a redheaded woman and an elephant (among others) on the run across Sweden from the law, the mob and the old-folks home --  but it doesn't have to be.  Just relax, laugh and enjoy the ride.
B003VS0CX8|1.0|This is a really nice version of a classic I've enjoyed for over 30 years. The colors and the music are wonderful on this disc. The multi-disc set is great. Unfortunately, in the first set I ordered the audio would pause during play on the Blu-ray disc in many spots while the video continued on. I'd have to completely stop play to get audio back. This was very disappointing given that I bought the classic for the music. No problem - Amazon replaced the set at no cost (really great service there!). Unfortunately the second set had the same problem.<br /><br />At this point I contacted support about the problem and was told that they would have someone look into the supply and suggested I wait a few days and reorder. Meanwhile, he would also expedite my refund and the free return of the second set. Again I thought the treatment of the problem by Amazon was outstanding.<br /><br />The support tech also suggested that I consider the streaming version of the movie but since I'd just watched it twice in the last 10 days and I actually wanted the multi-disc set, I didn't pursue this option. I ultimately decided not to reorder the set since I expect that the odds are I will end up with another set that doesn't play.<br /><br />I own a two-year old Samsung Blu-ray player and I've had no problems with any other discs I've watched on it.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|The only thing that keeps it going -- or that kept me reading (though I started to skim a bit) -- is the moral ambiguity: did the teenage son murder the schoolmate, does his father know, and what should-would a parent do when faced with those awful circumstances.  It is well written, but left me cold.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It is rare to find a captivating, ongoing story with little graphic violence or sex the offers so many loveable characters. Each episode leaves you wanting more and feeling good about having seen it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|loved everything about this movie. will definitely watch again. serious bloodletting as with all tarantino films. he makes gore an art form.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|First Contact is the best Next Generation's movie they have made. Great story and acting carries it from beginning to end without losing the audience.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas and thought it would be a good place to store her Barbies. She absolutely loves it!! The inside of the box once folded out looks like a house & the lid is a swimming pool. She plays with it all the time. Great buy!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Fantastic music and characters! Great story for all ages! It's a lot of fun! Everyone from my 2 year old GrandTwins, their Granparents and all the aunts and uncles are addicted!
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are awesome.  They always make fun movies.  Paul, is my favorite.  Sci-Fi with humor.  This is a great tale from beginning to end.  There is something for everyone in this movies, but most of all, there is enjoyment.  This movies will be one of those that are appreciated more and more as time passes and more people get to see it.  If you are thinking that you might buy this movie, I urge you to do so.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I bought this product because I was trying to open a document on my kindle, and the message kept popping up that I needed to purchase this app in order to get a better view of my documents.  I purchased it, and I have not been able to open this app since.  I am very pissed off and disappointed.  Should this stuff not come standard with the kindle fire?  Why charge me to use something that doesn't even work?  A waste of my time and money is what this was.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I have always liked this games and was glad to have found it on the site .. have liked everything so far
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I dont understand all the movie snobs that give this such low reviews.  It was fun, good for all ages, and great 3-d to boot.  My kids LOVED it, and the wife and I could enjoy a good movie to boot.  The china girl was priceless, and the acting choices were great.  I disliked the wizard at first, and then as he grew as a character he became more and more likable.  The three witches were all perfectly cast.  The only thing I didnt like was the first sisters instant transformation from the nice girl to the wicked witch just by one small device.  It was great and we cant wait for the 3d bluray to come out to watch it again.
1451695195|4.0|I suppose we'll all have to wait to find out if Dr. Alexander is right, but this book was convincing that there really is a life beyond earth.  I've heard of NDE, the tunnel and white light, and I have also heard neurologists say that the dying of the brain would cause that condition.  However, people have come back and there is a striking similarity in their descriptions.  Dr. Alexander's testimony has more credence because of his scientific background.  I basically think that people will believe what they want to believe -- remember, some even doubt the Holocaust, even though the Germans kept records of their atrocities!  But this book was well-written and should leave everyone with a sense of awe about the universe.
B004TJ1H2I|5.0|Watching the whole 2.5 hr movie in one sittings an undertaking. Sergio Leone's close up on faces, the long scenes, combined with Ennio Morricone's music make this a mythical movie.<br /><br />The uncut has overdubs done by the original actors--it is very noticeable. I would have preferred the overdubs to be done by voice actors who could match the vocal pitch like the rest of the movie. But the overdubbed parts don't last long so the movie is definitely not ruined.<br /><br />I'm very happy with my purchase and with blu-ray's HD quality. The picture looks great and clear, and the sound is perfect. Blu-ray really makes an already great movie even more enjoyable. [Make sure you buy the correct disc format for your player.] Enjoy the movie!
B00007GZR5|4.0|My husband and I saw this movie at the theater when it came out and were impressed at the beauty of it!  While the storyline is sad or disturbing, it is still good and we both enjoyed it.  I find Robin Williams hard to take sometimes-- he comes across too 'odd' to me.  But I thought he did a great job of serious acting in this movie.  4 stars
B000JLPMPS|4.0|I love western type movies (with Clint Eastwood in it), but this is different than anything I've ever seen. The story is well played, well written, and well acted. When I first watched it I couldn't remember character names, it seemed to go too fast, but after I watched it again I realized that I just have bad memory.<br />I would say this movie is more &#34;real&#34; than other westerns. What I mean is that when you watch certain parts; it just seems more realistic. Like in the movie, some one got shot in the tummy--and he didn't die right away. He was screaming for help, and water; for crying out loud, you don't see that in old westerns much.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I wish that the Mahjong picture could be  bit larger, since I am sight-impaired.  Than I could possibly play this game a bit<br />faster.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I wanted to find a mahjong, but didn't find one with appeal. Happy to see this one come along. Thanks!
B00AF6B22E|4.0|It was very entertaining.  Nail-biting for the first 1/2 and pathos for the rest.  Denzel was at his best acting.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Haven't read Stephen King in a long time. I could not put this book down once I started. Very well written and a great read
B003G4W49C|5.0|Nicely paced, draws you in as it materializes the personalities. Nicely finished and set up for the next book without trying too hard, as in this is a complete story by itself but yes I bought the next one already :0
B0043WHRWA|5.0|A revealing episode. Beckett always comes so close to solving her mothers murder and this episode does not disappoint. This episode will hook you into buying the next season.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really loved the puzzles in this game. It a thinking game and a puzzle. What more could you ask for ? Can't wait for the next room !
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great continuance from book 1!  Just love the story. Would recommend it for every couple, it's a must read series!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I didn't know what this movie was about when I started it, but my wife wanted to see it.  Turned out to be a great movie.  The acting was fantastic, and it was a great story with interesting characters.
B000XUBFE2|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and so I started reading with great expectations. I really believe the story was good but I could not get past the writing style. I found it clumsy and actually a distraction to the story. I made myself finish the book though I wanted to stop several times. I liked the last 15% of the book and was emotionally touched by the ending but really struggled to like the book because of the awkward narrative style.
1933492953|5.0|This book is really good explaining film techniques for camera production. The idea here is you can have a great scene but the the use of the camera (and tone using colors) is the real bread and butter! A must have for visual thinkers!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I've tried to download it twice now, and both times I get an error message.  Good thing I used my free Amazon coins to purchase this so I don't feel I've lost or wasted money.  Please fix!!!  My kids would love to play this game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time! I have read all 3 in record time, much to the neglect of my house! I almost cried when I finished the trilogy!
B002HFJ77S|4.0|This is probably my favorite Sophie Kinsella book because the story was unusual, and the ghost character was different--not always that nice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Download it it's free and its really fun. I spent like a bunch of hours on it just to get my high score and its better than temple run
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am so hooked on this show...I just love it...please include ALL seasons of The Good Wife...such quality...love it alot
B000063TS9|5.0|A truly incredible collection of Shostakovich that everyone MUST have! This is the exemplary art of an absolute genius! Bravo!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I laughed out loud & enjoyed every second of reading it! What an uplifting and comical book to read every night. :)
B003WMA7BU|4.0|If like me you saw the movie first, you might find yourself jarred when events and characters do not synch up to the film.  I was sad that certain people got killed who survived in the other version...ah well, it's a tragedy and I dig it.  The nameless Driver character is not exactly likeable but he is INTERESTING which is why we read books, am I right?  And the action never stops, even when he is waiting in desert motel rooms for bad guys to hunt him down.<br /><br />Not sure if I would read other Sallis novels because the subject matter is so masculine (a lot of info about cars and engines) but this was definitely worth the money.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Not your typical story of Snow White...to be sure!!! Very dark and very action packed. I loved the different twists they put on the story. I loved Charlize Theron's role. Beautiful scenery.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|its a good game. okay combat. my big problem is the jewel one. these jewels you have to buy and certain things can only be bought with them. its pretty good considering its an app. I like it
B009G78EE2|4.0|It's more than just a proclamation of having &#34;arrived&#34; this cd makes some hard hitting statements about life and being judgemental. Definitely worth checking out.
B004XC5LP0|4.0|this was a movie that i can watch more than once....it was interesting and the action was good.....the photography was good and i learned things i didn't know about volcanos
B001QWBM62|5.0|Is a perfect on the go recording machine, for any requirement you have, in some situations we trusted in it to pick up field sound in a long featured film without any problem¡¡
B009LRE040|5.0|It was a great rap up of the Batman trilogy !!!  Plus the introduction of Robin... Love the new cat woman ..
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever! The letter format made the story seem personal. I felt like I knew the characters personally and did not want the story to end! And I learned about a piece of history that I didn't previously know.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Like that it protects my Kindle, but wish could have more openings for plug in so when Kindle in use can keep plugged in. Still very useful when traveling.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!! ya its had a few glitches here and there but nothing really to worry about. it is sooooooo addicting!! I would recommend it for everyone of all ages!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great game for my kindle fire. I used to play on my pc@ home and loved it, but was tethered. This I can take with me!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really fun and awesome trying to get the people.<br />Also If you get coins you can get birds and stud also<br />You can get boxes.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The Five Love Languages of Love is a magnificent book to show people how to understand and relate to other people, especially to those in a relationship.  A must read for newlyweds, middle weds and senior weds!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|simply awesome; I look forward to many more episodes; the acting is terrific and the special effects are great for a TV show;
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Even no i am 14 i love it. I do not like most other games and this ones i cepper.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I thought it would change time when I went through time zones. the alarm worked so that is good and easy to set
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|It seems as though today we have to take all of our historical people and try to drag them down to a much lower level.<br />I know Lincoln was a mere mortal, but he did some mighty amazing things, and I prefer that we remember that.  Also, I don't know how historically accurate it was.  Not sure if everyone will think about that.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I made the mistake of viewing this film based upon the large number of high ratings.  The story is principally about Pat, an unstable bipolar man released from a mental hospital where he spent eight months in lieu prison time.  When he is discharged we find that the people in his life are almost as sick as he, leading one to suspect that they may have been the cause of the condition causing his hospitalization.  Through guilt trips, lies, trickery and insensitivity, his family and friends create an almost impossible return to reality for poor Pat.  While there were a few comical lines and scenes, I was annoyed by the film more than entertained, perhaps because I have a family member who was diagnosed as bipolar and his reactions to life's normal events are not a potential subject for a romantic comedy.  The film could have been a drama if treated more seriously.  Conversely, it could have been a black comedy exploring the absurdities of bipolar behavior.  To try to cut drama with comedy in this case does not make for a great film.  However, given the film's popularity, I would urge you to make up your own mind if the cost of the rental is something that you will not regard as a material loss if you are disappointed.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The surgeon's detailed story is very personal. It was believable because it came from a very intelligent and well-educated individual. This is no made up story but a very factual experience. I highly recommend this book to anyone that has had doubts about an after-life.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|I can't say I &#34;enjoyed&#34; this book , I don't think that is possible. The intensity of emotion that you are expecting versus the almost clinical detachment of the writing is deeply compelling. as I started to read this book, I kept saying I didn't want to continue. Instead, i put it down to take a shower, to pack for a trip the following day, and to make dinner, I read this in one day and was riveted the whole way. Ms. Sebold is an amazing woman.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I would never in my wildest dreams imagine that the Hobbit could be made into THREE movies! The shortest and least complex of the ring books, the intro and stage set as it were, is represented in film by the same amount of movie footage as the entire trilogy! Astounding!  Aside from that, it is one of the few times that ALL of (the first part) of a book is in the movie, and so far, I find I like it. The dark riddle sequence with Bilbo and Gollum is excellent. I look forward to the riddle scene with the Smaug in the next movie. My only real criticism of the film is that the actor, Martin Freeman playing Bilbo, very slightly resembles the actor, Billy Boyd, who played Pippin in the trilogy. It was disorienting to me at first, but I got over it. Couldn't wait to get the DVD after seeing the movie, and Amazon offered it at a very reasonable price, so soon after the theater release, that who could pass it up? Of course you know there will be collectors editions and sets after all three are released, but as I am no longer young, why wait!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you are having any thoughts about buying this book, do it. I have bought the first and second one for my wife (will be buying the 3rd one as well). I haven't read the first sentence of these books but I love them. Every time I see her reading it I know it's going to be a very good day (night)!
1476734941|5.0|My husband and I have been on the Fast Diet for about a month. Even though I am on the diet for the health benefits rather than weight loss, I am very pleased with the results. It is totally a doable lifestyle fasting Mondays and Thursdays.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I would expect that everyone is already acquainted with the Hindu concept of reincarnation.  If we are reborn as people (and not as frogs or poodles) then we are destined to meet the same souls from our previous existence -- although your wife could be your daughter, your father could be your brother, etc.  The movie revolves around this belief, although someone helpful in world \\"A\\" could be someone who wants to kill you in world \\"B\\", etc.  A movie this broad hinges on being able to create strong bonds through times/worlds, and it fails to do that. With so many A-list actors onboard, you'd think the movie couldn't fail.  Wrong.  I couldn't see any reason for the film being nearly three hours long -- most people will find this to be a colossal bore. The only saving graces are the cinematography and the special effects. There is a very brief homosexual scene toward the beginning, and this alone caused a number of viewers to stop watching -- although their comments never actually identified what the big turn-off was about.  A much better metaphysical movie to watch is \\"The Fountain,\\" which is far more artful and moving.  I gave \\"Cloud Atlas\\" a generous three stars because it is very ambitious and tries to be original.  I think if you go into it with an empty mind, you may find a few scenes that are engaging, but no guarantees.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The app, is good to go! It may be an awesome app, if you could save your purchases, onto the devices, but, you need to be online... Can you fix this?
B00BGV0YD0|5.0|Anyone who likes the blues with an up beat sound has to listen to this!  It is the Doors at their best.  Waiting For The Sun and The Spy along with the rest of the songs are mesmerizing.  For a person who could not read a lyrical note, Jim really mastered the ability to keep the listener their money's worth!
B0028MBKVG|3.0|This book starts out slow and a bit strange, however if you stock with it. It provides great wisdom for running and a great ending.
B008A5H78K|5.0|The Doors can never be replaced.  The lyrics combined with Jim Morrison's voice are sometimes haunting, and at other times playful.  Either way, the Doors were ahead of their time. It was an era of turbulent times and tragedies, but one that brought out the best music!

B008JLEUD0|4.0|This fine 2012 debut from Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara showcases her distinctive melodic voice singing her own songs in her native Bambara tongue with themes as serious as personal betrayal, the effect of wars in Africa, the plight of illegal African migrants in Europe, arranged marriage and female circumcision.<br /><br />In addition to accompanying her own voice on simple acoustic guitar traditional western rock guitars, bass and drums are deployed alongside West African instruments like the kori, calabash and ngoni, so the result has a distinctive `world music' sound.<br /><br />Most of the album was recorded at Livingston Studios in London and produced by Diawara and Nick Gold, and the quality of the mix is superb.<br /><br />The album's main feature is Diawara's melodic voice and it has some beautiful, poignant moments. However it somehow lacks that indefinable quality (which for example Salif Keita has in spades) which really sets your hair on fire. It also needs to be said that at by the end of the album the tracks are starting to sound very much the same, with little variation in dynamics. But there's no doubt about it: for a debut recording it's pretty impressive and knocks the spots off most `popular' music manufactured to feed the tastes of western audiences. Fatou is still young, an obviously talented natural singer and composer who seems - on the evidence of this collection - to have what it takes to develop into a significant force in world music. We should look forward to her follow-up album to see in which direction it grows.<br /><br />The CD package is excellent with a 24-page booklet offering all the song lyrics in the original Bambara with translations in each case into French and English.
B008B1BL4E|3.0|This is a very detailed history of the events in Europe leading up to the First World War.  Perhaps too detailed.  While the events are meticulously researched, it is easy to lose the thread of the causes of the war in the detail of all of the happenings in various countries.The book is nonetheless fascinating, but if all the reader wants to know is how the war came to be, a less detailed overview would be instructive.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I can't seem to stop this game. I am simply drawn to continue playing over and over. very fun!<br />wish the live didn't dissappear sometimes but overall great game.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|If you've been wondering about DevOps, or if you're already interested but are unsure where to start, or how to convince the right people, read this.<br /><br />I suspect this book will be very entertaining to anyone who's worked as a developer or in IT. It did remind me of a few horror stories!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|JoJo Moyes has a base plot to her books.  Someone gets in a life altering accident and love flows from there  . . . might I add under the most unlikely circumstances.  This book has you willing the characters to do this or that or make the next move. It was touching and sentimental and filled my &#34;I need a romantic love story&#34; craving.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Very good quality. The adjustable compartments are handy. The price is fantastic. Very happy with the purchase. My son has the same one and recommended it to me.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I typically read historic fiction and romance. But, I wanted a change of pace and was curious to see if Lee Child's character Jack Reacher could keep me interested.  He did.  That is --- THEY did.  Child has an interesting story as a writer which is shared in the preface and Reacher is a modern day Robin Hood with a touch of Terminator in him, who thinks like a robotic genius under pressure.  It kept my interest indeed, and I looked forward to picking it up and finding out what was going to happen next.  I think I'll read Book 2 next.
B009GED3HS|4.0|Love this show. We missed season 8 on TV and started watching on Amazon. Can't wait to finish the season!
B000V1Z8KK|4.0|It was an action packed movie with some humor. Itshows how corruption happens even in the military. They got what they deserved in the end.
0439023513|1.0|The first and the second books show many bright qualities of the main characters such as Katniss and Peeta's determination to keep each other safe, Peeta's caring so much for Katniss, etc. On the other hand, the book is so depressing. It may seem to be exciting for some readers, but the beauty of love and imaginations are gone completely in this book. I felt broken and shattered. I was so gloomy all the way to the end. I did not expect this because the previous books show some hints of hope for something good (or may be I personally hope for it).<br /><br />And it's very disappointing that many characters that made reader fall in love with, such as Prim and Finnik, dies like a blow. The dying moment was so short and so unimportant.<br /><br />I find this book very hard to comprehend. Many times I made a wrong imagination of what happen to who.

0316113514|5.0|This book is so clear amd well written on a subject that can be confusing. We all know we are supposed to exercise for our health, but learning the hows and whys in a way that is so understandable is inspiring. This book is a conversation changer.
1400067820|5.0|If you recognize the complexity of the modern world is increasing exponentially and would like to understand how to cope more effectively, this is a must read.  It has provided for me a context from which to parse the increasing amount of data we encounter allowing a clearer path to information and separating signal from noise.  This is not to say one will agree with all points made in this book, but the basic premises are sound and enlightening.<br />To be sure, it can be a difficult read with its obscure and worldwide references, but I'll suggest that with an open mind and some thought, you will come away with a better understanding of what's going on out there and how you can adapt more effectively.

B00C49H3WI|5.0|Other than Dexter, this might be my new favorite tv show.  I am typically struggling to find shows that I like on tv, and never would've thought a show like this would be on BBC.  Kudos to BBC!! This is a mix between Alias and Dollhouse.  The acting is excellent and the characters are exciting.  I am so glad that BBC renewed for a second season. Tatiana is an amazing actress (great in Eastern Promises and Picture Day). That is how I stumbled across the show.  I can't wait for season 2!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Awesome book! Would definitely recommend reading this book. The movie was awesome too but I like the book a lot more.
0525478817|4.0|It took me several chapters to get into the dialogue  and style the main characters used when speaking. It felt a bit contrived, but once I got into the lingo of the main characters the story moved. The book is very engaging and Green introduces numerous themes throughout the book. The plot is very simple, and character development focuses only on two individuals, but the story held my interest and I found it difficult to put the book down.

In any number of ways, this book is a real find for comparative lawyers as well as IP lawyers interested in acquiring a truly international perspective on developments in this field.<br /><br />The book, says the editor, Toshiko Takenaka is the result of collaborations between European and Asian scholars who participated in a ten year project co-sponsored by the Research Center for the Legal System of Intellectual Property (RCLIP) at Waseda Law School in Tokyo and - in addition - its counterpart at the University of Washington in Seattle: the Center For Advanced Study and Research on Intellectual Property (CASRIP).<br /><br />Interestingly this fruitful collaboration resulted in, among other things, the translation of over 1500 cases from France, Germany Italy and Spain and more from India and the UK being translated and eventually incorporated into the RCLIP database --available publicly, you will be pleased to discover -- and therefore a good thing for IP lawyers to know about.<br /><br />To commemorate this important 10 year project, the articles contained in this volume have been especially written for it and are therefore reassuringly up to date.  IP lawyers on both sides of the Atlantic will be particularly interested, for example, in the article co-authored by the editor with his colleague Martin J. Adelman on a lengthy patent law debate in America over what is known as the `first-to-file-priority'.  This chronically controversial matter has now been resolved with the signing by President Obama of the America Invents Act (AIA) of 16 December 2011.<br /><br />We were also taken by the article in the appendix on `The patent laws of old,' by Mario Franzosi who explains that the concept of a patent law was a feature of the ancient world as well as the modern.<br /><br />Franzosi quotes a law from Sybaris in southern Italy circa 510 BC - that often notorious city of luxury and excess as well as innovation.  In part, the law states that `where one of either the caterers or the cooks invents an original and elaborate dish, no one other than the inventor is allowed to use the recipe therefore, before a year has passed and such that the inventor has the exclusive right to derive a profit there from'.<br /><br />This intriguing insight, as well as the wealth of other information and comment in this book makes it a worthwhile acquisition for IP practitioners everywhere, particularly those making a comparative study of IP in both common law and civil law jurisdictions.e were also taken by the article in the appendix on `The patent laws of old,' by Mario Franzosi who explains that the concept of a patent law was a feature of the ancient world as well as the modern.<br /><br />Franzosi quotes a law from Sybaris in southern Italy circa 510 BC - that often notorious city of luxury and excess as well as innovation.

The three editors are Professors in the Faculty of Law at Monash University, Australia (John Duns is an Associate Professor) and offer an entirely international perspective on the topic.<br /><br />Other contributors hail variously from a diversity of prestige institutions from, for example, Oxford University, the Universities of Cambridge, Glasgow, California, Illinois and others besides.<br /><br />The springboard for the book was a conference in 2011 on this diverse subject held in Italy at which a number of papers were presented on the legal field of research in innovation and invention. The book is the enlightening - and enlightened - result.  As the editors point out, Italy was an appropriate setting for such an initiative `as many great inventions and innovations have emanated from inventors in that country - - from Da Vinci to Marconi and beyond.' Also, may we add, the food's great!<br /><br />As the editors explain, innovation is a central pillar in government policy agendas that aim to produce a \\"resilient economy\\" through competition and productivity.  In a modern society, these activities are linked to entrepreneurial activity, which in both the shorter and longer term drives prosperity.  Can there be a better incentive for business-oriented lawyers to read this book!<br /><br />Grouped into seven sections and extensively footnoted, the book provides a useful tool for researchers and covers public as well as private sector issues and corporate governance.<br /><br />As the publishers Edward Elgar point out, it is particularly relevant to policy makers, university administrators, and lawyers involved in labour, employment and competition law as well as technology transfer and IP.  The publication date is cited as at June 2012.es prosperity.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|Very easy read. Plot was good and suspenseful. However authors writing style was hard to follow. Good book nothing to exciting though. I wouldn't have spent money on this book.
B009K6DKTS|2.0|An entertainingly written book but quite difficult to put into context. Clearly Taleb is a brilliant thinker but also challenges many conventional wisdoms. I cannot agree with many of his radical assertions, eg that analysis is useless (must you rely on the lowest common denominator of ignorance? Or just believe Taleb?). He also derides predictions and even has the arrogance to express anger at someone making a prediction. I don't know if he has ever worked in a corporate environment. Managers need predictions -it doesn't matter how correct they turn out to be because you can at least look back and learn from it. I have always said to my consultants that I want them to give me a number, to take a stand. They won't be crucified if they are wrong. I just need the best estimate they can give. Of course there are always predictions (usually the lower middle road) and scenarios (High to Low roads with probabilities attached) which protects the planners from total ridicule. After all the great scenario planners from the Royal Dutch Shell school (from Pierre Wack, to Arie De Geus, Kees van der Heijden Peter Schwarz and Joseph Jaworski et al) have made a huge contribution to business learning - which Taleb can only hope to aspire to.

Bilbo played an important part in the finding of the ring and Gollum's part in the story as well as the Dwarves and the Misty Mountain where the ring was found. Loved it. It belongs a part of The Lord Of The Rings story.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|An ideal story for those interested in pushing themselves to their limits of distance running over 20 miles, I immediately got back outside into running &#34;easy, light, smooth, [and hopefully] fast&#34; (soon enough). Mcdougall reminded me of why I have always been able to find solace in setting out for a run ever since Middle School.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the evolutionary hypotheses of the &#34;Running Man&#34; as well as the latest studies of the benefits of cheap, if not, nonexistent, running shoes.<br /><br />Americans should use this book to explore NOT how little exercise they can get away with, but rather what they could actually accomplish if they are to return to their healthier, naturally-running roots.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|In order to appreciate this film, one must be familiar with the original series as well as the film series. To talk about the plot is pointless, other than to say Khan is back. Benedict Cumberbatch is a rather boring Khan who lacks the exotic look and class of Ricardo Montalban. Fortunately the cast of regulars can carry the film.<br /><br />The film also introduces Carol Marcus (Alice Eve). In the original film version Carol Marcus was an early conquest of Kirk (Chris Pine). She would have his child, a son who was ultimately killed by Klingons. If you have never seen the Khan film, then the juxtapositions in this film will be meaningless and the genius and enjoyment hindered.<br /><br />Another aspect of the early series is that it was reflective of the era with Klingons representing Russia and Romulans being China. That symbolism is meaningless today, so our writers cleverly use the aspect of terrorism as a way to maintain the original flavor of the series. Likewise the character of James Kirk, who did things on hunches and &#34;out of the box&#34; is maintained in this film, perhaps the only real reason we tolerated Shatner in that role in the first place.<br /><br />Dialogue is recycled. Zachary Quinto captures Spock. The role of Uhura has been expanded and Zoe Saldana kicks a lot of women to the curb. Bones (Karl Urban) still throws out the metaphors. Simon Pegg still needs to work on Scotty. John Cho is working hard to fill the big shoes of Sulu, whose stardom has multiplied as an Amazon reviewer. There is mention of Nurse Christine Chapel from the original TV and film series which didn't fit into the plot, perhaps a clue to the next script, or maybe I missed something. Perhaps some nice Trekkie could toss me a bone on this one in the comments section and I can edit this review.<br /><br />Be warned, there is zero character introduction. If you don't know who these characters are, the film will just be a special effects meh. The picture has its light moments, but I thought could use some more. Hopefully the next film we can re-introduce Harry Mudd a Star Trek favorite who made two episode appearances.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. A man wakes up in bed with two women. Alice Eve bra/panties.but I thought could use some more.

B00364K6J2|5.0|A great movie for young and old.  In the place of curse words, the characters will say cuss...&#34;as an example, Mr. Fox might say, What the cuss do you think you are doing?&#34; (instead of what the hell do you...).  I highly recommend it!

B009NG1Q96|5.0|I couldn't wait to get my hands on this! After reading the first book and the short novella, I dove right in. The plot is furthered well, and presents some unique challenges to America. I would LOVE another short novella from Maxon's point of view for this one. I think his point of view would lend itself better to this sequel better than it did to the first story.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game is great. It is definitely worth the money. It plays great on my kindle fire. And its fun. Very addictive and keeps you interested. Great graphics and very cool music. I havnt had any problems with it yet. I cant wait for another one
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Loved the show and loved the movie. Of all the movies or shows I have ever seen I would like to see this carry on more than any other. I have now bought the series twice and the movie three times. And I am not usually the type to watch a movie or show more than once.
B0054YHB8Q|5.0|I originally owned this CD as an eight track cassette & have enjoyed listening to it.  Brings back LOTS of fond memories from the late '70s!
B002GSXKN8|4.0|It's worth it, I'd get it again. I wasn't expecting anything extravagant, just movies. They work, they're not scratched, buy it.

1451624468|5.0|I had seen Dr. Krauss' talk on the subject, but I was interested in a more detailed exploration of the topic.  This book did not disappoint.  Recommended.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Each episode keeps you coming back for more. Full of everything from suspense to disaster on daily basis. Whats next?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|granddaughter wanted this game.  she really likes  and plays when she's. empty handed at grandma's without her kindle. personally i have'nt tried to play yet.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i loved this game it has pipes and stuff and is reallly supa good and like i love being able to connect colora to each other and like do awesome plummer related tasks yummy.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|My four year old grandson loves this game and has even shown me how to play it and I enjoy it too.  No problems with freezing up.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I used my free coins to buy this game and am enjoying it very much. It keeps my mind active.
B00CRR5YA0|1.0|Too much noise. No melody. Nothing memorable. Every track the same noise. I love all things Star Trek but not this soundtrack.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|The game was fine--typical build something and maintain it game with quests to complete. The graphics were well done and it worked well on my Kindle. Unfortunately, some quests require you to use more &#34;pearls&#34; than you can easily earn through the game, and that makes it hard to complete quests and move ahead. I broke down and purchased the smallest number of pearls, just so I could advance in the game, but they were never credited to my account. I contacted customer service and never received a response, and that is what completely turned me off on the game.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot it brings back that goodness of retro game play. I love the comic mischief mixed with action pack punch-n-go play.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is very enjoyable.  It focuses too much on social media.  Once you hit a certain point it becomes hard to expand the city without having to pay for it.  That is the main reason this game gets a 4 instead of a 5.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved all the characters. Didn't want to put it down. So much action. The end brought a few tears. Get it you'll love it.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|when it was my turn it was a check and I had a chance to move away but then on the screen it said sorry checkmate when it was my turn and I didn't move.
0525478817|5.0|I was not able to put this down! It's a great story and it's weird because I am not one to gravitate towards books about young teenage love but this was so much more than that. Thank you Tumblr ;)
030758836X|5.0|Amy and Nick Dunne were a lovely couple, their love one to rival the sappiest romantic pairing in the history of romances...that is until Amy disappears and Nick is the prime suspect in the disappearance. Things quickly escalate and ol' Nicky looks to be in a world of trouble. Though, this isn't the entire gist of the story. Oh no, it gets much stickier and leads you down roads that twist when you think they'll turn and zig when you think they'll zag. This novel is a thrilling mystery that had me scratching my head at its brilliance unfolded before my eyes. I was shocked at how things turned out about three-quarters through the book, and the ending is one I surely didn't see coming. Gone Girl is one of the best reads I've had this year so far, and I would recommend it to those who enjoy a...different view on unhappy marriages \\"changing things up.\\"
B00AB7HESI|4.0|this app is very cool but it runs out of levels very fast so you have to buy knew<br />ones
B003NRYMZQ|1.0|Torchwood is supposed to be this uber-elite team protecting the world from the alien menace.<br /><br />If they we need them for protection, we are doomed!<br /><br />They act like a bunch of untrained middle school kids (and no offense to middle school kids, actually I would rather have you protecting us than this pathetic \\"team\\").<br /><br />I put team in quotes because they never act like a team. They constantly bicker and feud and turn on each other. And it is obvious that they have never trained to efficiently and professionally undertake the missions that they are supposed to be doing. They seem to just show up at the \\"crime scene\\", randomly run around, get very lucky, allow the death of multiple civilians and then solve the mystery, more or less.<br /><br />They're supposed to outrank the police and the military, but they could benefit from taking a little basic training from both.<br /><br />The worst part of the show is that there is very little consistency from one episode to the next (and sometimes not even within each individual episode).  In one of the early episodes, one of the team members endangers the entire team, directly causes the death of two innocent civilians, directly disobeys the direct orders of the team leader, threatens to kill that same team leader and by his actions threatens to destroy humanity.  Again, the team gets lucky and the menace is dealt with.<br /><br />Now in real life, the errant team member would be punished. At best, he would be kicked off the team.  But in the world of Torchwood, there are no repercussions.  Even worse, the offending team member exhibits no remorse.<br /><br />I could go on and on in great detail, but I don't want to give away any spoilers.  Of course, I shouldn't worry, because I would not want to inflict this nonsense on anyone.  I recommend you not waste your time.<br /><br />I wanted to like this.  I really did.  I have always like the Doctor.  I liked Jack Harkness' character when he appeared in Doctor Who, but I do not like him in this.<br /><br />If you want a show that does an excellent job of showing trained and talented individuals protecting humanity from the alien menace, I recommend \\"Fringe\\".
B000FCKPHG|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Some really useful insights, however, some of the anecdotes went on and on and on...  I am a teacher and a parent and will be taking some of Dr. Dweck's suggestions into my classroom and my children's rooms.  It is worth the read.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|I wanted to see this in the theatres but never found the time. I saw it tonight for instant video and bought it right away. Glad i did it is worth the $12.99
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|I just loved my cds.... I have been wanting this for soooo long it is just awsome Thank you sooooo much.
0060987464|5.0|Loved it!  I really learned a lot about Manson and where he comes from and this sheds a lot of light on interpreting his work.
B0084670FU|4.0|This movie is good with excellent interaction of the different story lines.  But that also means you need to pay attention
0800141849|5.0|It is a wonderful movie I love the meaning and the soundtrack is one of the reasons I love the movir
B004VFMCWE|4.0|Excellent movie with Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall.  simple but good plot development right through to a slighly unpredictable ending
B00540G3G6|2.0|The film itself,  quality. The 3D format  rather disappointing.  My mistake as I was expecting it to be the quality of a newly made film.
B0095P33IW|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Well done story line a little implausable as you might expect as it is a fantasy genre
B0013FDM7E|1.0|I am very disappointed...I opened the case and looked at the disc and noticed th as t it was a totally different disc, not even cool
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Can't stop reading these stories. Lee Childs is such a great author whom I hope keeps more of these stories coming.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My kids waited patiently all day for our family movie night.  When the time came, and the highly anticipated Tangled DVD began, it became clear right away that our copy is damaged and way beyond use or repair.  Everyone was terribly disappointed until I remembered Amazon Instant Video.  Within two minutes Tangled was up and running without a glitch, hiccup, or delay.  Perfect!  Family movie night was saved and we had a great evening.  I love this service!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Love the story line. Jack Reacher stories are the ones you just can't stop reading about. It's addicting to read about.

B00CATSONE|4.0|This shows how uncouth and deceptive some men can become through their jealousy of some things that proves better than theirs.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|This movie keeps you guessing through the whole thing.  You have questions.  At the end, you find out why, and you want to watch it again to put all the pieces together.  Suspenseful.  DiCaprio did a fabulous job with this very intense part.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the app because it is a fun and take my word for it and it was the  first app for my kindlefire and I really love horse's so I totally recommend this game
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a great app for any equestrian enthusiast... definitely worth a free download. Don't be put off by the child-friendly appearance. This game is fun for all ages!

B00BPXKWGS|5.0|In regards to the new Green anniversary edition, the concert on disc 2 is the same show as featured on Tourfilm.  However, Tourfilm only featured 17 songs so if you count the Record Store Day EP (or if you get the itunes or MP3 version) you get 9 more songs than on Tourfilm.<br /><br />The only song from Tourfilm that is not included in this set is their cover of The Velvet Underground's After Hours that played over the credits.  It can be found on the UK Losing My Religion CD single from Mar 91 and the UK Losing My Religion 12\\" single from Feb 91.<br /><br /> There were a couple of snippets of other peoples' songs that Stipe sang as song intros that were on Tourfilm but are not included here.  These were before I Believe and King of Birds.  However, the spoken intro to I Believe is still in tact, they just edited the song snippet out that came between the intro and the song.  Other songs on this CD (and/or mp3) that keep their spoken intros from Tourfilm include: You Are The Everything, and I Remember California.<br /><br />Other songs that had spoken intros on Tourfilm but lost them on CD are: Turn You Inside-Out, These Days, World Leader Pretend, Get Up, Begin the Begin, and Finest Worksong.<br /><br />Also, for the b-side collectors and completists, some of these same Tourfilm recordings had previously appeared as follows:<br /><br />1.  Stand:  Losing My Religion (UK CD) (Mar 91).<br /><br />2.  Turn You Inside-Out:  Losing My Religion (UK CD) (Mar 91).

B007HC3LHS|3.0|ok once you got used to how it jumped back and forth...<br />i dont have 8 more words for this book. did not really grab me
B002FQOI0A|5.0|First of all, I read this on a kindle. It was really nice. Second of all, I love how Rebecca Stead used all these different elements of A Wrinkle in Time (another one of my favorite books). She used them give hints about her story.<br /><br />She uses some of the characters that end up being you, to not be good or intriguing in the beginning. I also love how  it is from Miranda's point of view and that she talks to you and incorporates you in the story.<br /><br />One more thing, the book explains everything (such as time travel or the laughing man or why Sal wouldn't walk with Miranda) in I away that really makes you think about it and process it in your brain a lot longer then most books do.<br /><br />So overall, this book is wonderful and I recommend that everyone read it. It is great, but you should read A Wrinkle in Time first because it is very like that book and it tells some of what happens.
B009QW6ZT8|1.0|What started out as a great series that had an edgy appeal and great story-line has slowly faded into a typical sitcom. The back-story of all the characters has been told in the last two seasons and they have found a safe haven (Prison). Enter the gratuitous antagonist, the governor. He is a real bastard and his two-faced approach to his town is awesome and aggravating to the point of wanting to quit the show. The third season could be thrown into a pot and boiled down to about 4 excellent episodes culminating in the death of the governor. Instead, you get a drawn out plot with predictable and boring story lines building to the biggest television disappointment in years. Killing off Andrea and letting the governor slip away. Many of the episodes seem contrived and the outcomes can be predicted in the first 5 minutes. You hope against hope that it won't end as guessed, but sure enough it does. Maybe I can recharge my watching batteries before the next season, but for now I would not waste money paying for this on demand, wait for it to hit prime or Netflix.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Game is colorful, easy to play.  Some layouts are more difficult and keep you on your toes when trying to make the forward matches so future matches are possible
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|His new novel is exactly what I have been waiting for. Right from the beginning I was caught. I had to read very slowly, and reread to really enjoy how the story develops, and also not come to the end to fast. It is a novel i will read again in a year's time with same pleasure. I am looking forward the his next.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I played this game on my galaxy s3 and loved it.  It finally became available for my Kindle HD and it is even more amazing.  Especially since I have the big screen kindle.
B001JU4S44|3.0|OK, I know it's like James Bond.  Huge money and care spent on stunts and expensive special effects and no realism whatsoever.  But the problem is ridiculous stunt followed by ridiculous stunt followed by explosions that don't make any sense followed by ridiculous stunt end up becoming boring.  I swear the most exciting part was the beginning where TC was climbing.  Just because it was different.  I've seen where a semi crashes into an SUV sideways and the SUV blows up completely because it's a stunt.  I've seen where people do impossible things with vehicles and things blow up for no reason.  But at least the climbing was different.  How many times can a person watch something blow up that should not blow up? And then getting shot at with the fake sparking and bullets completely around TC but of course he isn't hit.  That's pretty old too.  Three stars for the money and time spent and for TC doing many of his own stunts and the effort.
B00AM7E4P8|5.0|Michael pollan never disappoints, providing historical and philosophical insights wrapped up in wit and wry humour - my humour, my politics and concerns are all catered for nicely - and I don't mean he smooths the way by reinforcing my beliefs, not at all - his prose gives me pause for thought and laugh out loud moments during the course of the read.  Although as i am an ecologist I can see he's missed the point on some issues, it doesn't detract from the book.  I highly recommend this author.
B008ENA74E|4.0|Deep behind-the-scenes profile of life at Goldman that dispels the perception they conduct business in the best interests of their clients. The fact is that Goldman at least played by the rules, though they creatively molded them to their advantage.  Others did far worse.  Some are in jail.  I commend Mr. Smith. Good read, but some of the personal stuff was not germane.
B009NY43NY|1.0|OK I waited for a year for this and totally hated it.  i could rehash what everyone else has stated but I won't.  What I will say is that it felt as if she ran out of ideas and went with such a far out of left field idea to pair Sookie with Sam that I had to put the book down and walk away for a day I was so angry.  Seriously?  I get the whole \\"Sam is my best friend\\" piece but that was exactly it, Sam was her best friend and hello just the week before he had been in lust with Janelynn and before that it was several other women.  Sookie has never even hinted at wanting to be with Sam.  Then the whole ridiculous plot about Copley,  please give us a break.  Beyond boring.  Why out of the blue would this guy suddenly decide he needed to have total control of his daughter.  My wish had been that through all their ups and downs that Sookie and Eric would finally get their happily ever after.  I had hoped that Bill would ultimately ride off into the sunset with Freida as a substitute thanks to all his business/computer acumen and the money he had made Area 5.  But interactions with Eric were reduced to less than 5 pages and Bill had a grand total of 3 pages if that.  Pam, a favorite of mine got equal treatment.  So completely upset with how this series ended.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Learned a lot about French history. Such a great story! I loved how or connected the two time periods and the people. I highly recommend it! Sad but so worth reading!
B00632HWOG|4.0|The best app for Yahoo mail on the Kindle Fire that I've used. I highly reccommend this app if you have a Yahooo mail account you want to access from your Kindle.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|very very basic, nothng new, limited in all ways...save your money,  other progams offer more interesting effects etc, this one was a total boor
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|This album is important because it illustrates Jimi &#34;coming into his own.&#34; There can be no telling what heights he would have obtained, if he would have had a couple more years. I bought this album for a friend that appreciates the blues much more than I do. When I feel like some good blues, this album would be on my list along with Stevie Ray Vaughn.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great game many varieties to choose from never gets boring.  Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys MahJong. The best of all the MahJong games!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Maybe I'm an &#34;instant gratification&#34; kinda guy now?<br /><br />Or, maybe, more to the point, being over 50 I'm not too crazy about the idea of waiting; being aware of my mortality and all.<br /><br />Still, this was a great movie.  Not &#34;traditionally Tolkien&#34; but close enough to satisfy even the less than easy to please.<br /><br />I rented it but will definitely buy the trilogy pack to go with my Lord of the Rings box set.
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|It just wants to start a game, maybe I'm too dumb but I can't figure out what I'm suppose to do. It does not seem to have an option for explaining the game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is really really adickding so if you have children you can let them posy but they will never want to give your divice back
B00006LPEY|5.0|This is an excellent edition of Akira. I have the blu ray version. which is beautiful, but this dvd is by far much better. the picture is crystal clear and the audio is suberb. I'm very pleased I got this version. It is region 1/a. It does have subtitles, which are crystal clear as well. Would I recommend buying this version. Oh, Definitely. It is actually far superior to the blu ray version
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this a lot and don't think it could be improved upon.  The interface is what a good calculator should be.  What more could be said? - I'm not sure.  Highly recommended...
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Always a good, entertaining episode. Can't go wrong with this show, looking forward to the next one. If you watch this you're just 5 away from the season finale
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Son and I watched this movie together and really enjoyed it. It was funny and clean. I would definitely recommend for all ages. Can't wait to watch again.
0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond is an evolutionary biologist, specializing in the birds of New Guinea. Twenty five years before the writing of Guns Germs and Steel he would be asked by a New Guinea politician: how is it that the white world seems to have developed so much stuff to bring into New Guinea and the native population had so few material things to deliver back to the west? By extension this book is a bio-scientists effort to answer there generic question: why is it that the cultures of the western world seem to have dominated over so many others?<br /><br />Before commenting on his answer some things should be clear. First, Jared Diamond's expertise is not comparative religion, economics, or geo-politics. His approach is to emphasize fundamental factors that lay below or prior to later, and clearly more human driven differences. Second, in science when you are attempting to propose a new way of thinking about a topic, it is virtually assumed that your original hypothesizes, may prove to be false or in need of refinement.<br /><br />Jared Diamond's proposal is that to the degree that western forces have been dominate in world history, it is due to advantages that western forces have had first in geography and secondly in becoming the collection point for technology.<br /><br />There are more possible answers and some better answers. These are the ones Diamond will detail.<br /><br />It is a military principle that land is fate. The army that begins a battle holding grounds better than those in the hands of the opposing forces has a significant, sometimes irreversible advantage. Jared Diamond, argues that Western Europe begins with the advantage in geography. First; humans arrived in Europe before humans arrived in other lands, New Guinea for example. Second, Europe would combine a number of natural and theoretical advantages in terms of the food and animal species that can lend themselves to domestication; that were native too, or would migrate to or migrate with the European population. Having made a case for east west transmission of plant and animal species, Diamond makes a similar case for the transmission of culture. Through culture, learning, science and technology would also tend to accumulate in Europe. These factors combine to promote the formation of an economy that can fund accelerated technological development.<br /><br />Diamond theorizes that Africa, for example may have had an older population, but that natural migration for these kinds of plants and animals is easier moving east to west than north to south. The basis of this theory is that transcontinental movement, north to south tends to mean movement across more kinds of environments and geographic barrier and therefor more kinds of threats to specie survival.<br /><br />Incidental to this older association between man and domestic animals is that the transmission of animal born disease to humans would have occurred early for the European human population. This allows for centuries or even millennia for the Europeans to develop immunity. This fact would be crucial in one of the first direct contests between invading Europeans colonists and native New World populations.<br /><br />Jared Diamond uses the battle at Cajamarca as a demonstration for his suppositions. The Native Inca population would meet in battle against the smaller army of His most Catholic Majesty, King Charles I of Spain. This battle was not necessary; the Inca nation had no committed desire to fight a people they had the right to consider as invaders. The Incas would be slaughtered. The slaughter would be attended by approving Catholic priests making a poor case for comparative religion. What preceded this battle was an epidemic that had decimated the Incan royal family and destabilized the culture. The European forces were not equally laid low by this disease, because they had, unintentionally brought it ahead of the military invasion.  European victory was built on a few guns, more steel and a pathcleared in part by disease.<br /><br />From this ugly example of raw power and unconscious genetic advantage, Guns, Germs and Steel explores a wide number of biologically based factors that appear to underwrite the spread of European cultural and political dominance. Almonds, for example would seem an unlikely example of geological/biological advantages for the west, but here such a case is made.<br /><br />There are two major reasons why I recommend this book. Jared Diamond is an example of a scientific mind capable of creative thinking, published in a language that is instructive and inviting. The flow of his argument is logical and scientific in its comprehension, but accessible and a pleasure for the reader. Second he is proposing a new approach to historical analysis. Jared Diamond has not invented the theory of human history as a logical outcome of geography and biology, but he has applied it in a new and creative manner.<br /><br />My initial response to Guns, Germs, and Steel was more enthusiastic than the four stars would suggest. My caution is that you, the reader will have to create for yourself or actively seek out alternate answers to Yali's question.cleared in part by disease.<br /><br />From this ugly example of raw power and unconscious genetic advantage, Guns, Germs and Steel explores a wide number of biologically based factors that appear to underwrite the spread of European cultural and political dominance.

B0083P1QUM|5.0|My favorite author, does it again.  Three different deaths, three totally different types of personalities with diffusely different jobs,hobbies,work, tied together so masterfully in such an unexpected plot.  The entire Scarpetta &#34;family&#34; and cohorts, each involved in his/ her own way to further entangle the mystery and carry the reader along to the exciting conclusion makes this book a &#34;don't want to put it down&#34; read.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Maybe I didn't give it a long chance but its not very engaging. Made it through the tutorial but only slinging the birds isn't very fun with a few extra actions here and there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this game probably too much. But it never gets old and they are always coming out with updates.
B005HSL626|3.0|A nice time waster if you're waiting or bored. Has three different modes and you can minimally customize your game exp. Nice game.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|He can write, he can sing!  Always lovin Justin Hayward!!  He is definitely the voice of the Moody Blues.  Worth checking out.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Hard to put down. Was a bit confusing at first but all the hints helped. Enjoyed many games by this company.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Great show, specially if you are into that genre and terminator movies. The series gives great background to the movies and serves as a great filler and foreshadows what's to come in the movies.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Great looking app and easy to use. No apparent issues with battery life so far and I've been using it for a couple of months now.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I LOVE THE CHRISTMAS ALBUM. I LOVE ROD STEWART AND HAVE JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING HE HAS RECORDED. I EVEN HAVE HIM AS MY CELL PHIONE RING.

193700788X|4.0|I think all the people who are so upset about this book are either actually just upset that the series is ending or they are just acting like childish brats having a tantrum because they didn't get their way. Ms. Harris tried to tie up some loose ends, give a nod to past characters and give the happy ending to Sookie that she deserved. My question to everyone who is upset is what did you think was going to happen? Sookie was clear from the begining about not wanting to be turned. How was she going to get her happily ever after with Eric? If you are saying nasty things about Ms. Harris, after enjoying the series up until now, you are being a fair weather fan. I only wish this book would have been longer or for the series to have gone on forever. Thanks for everything, Charlaine.

1419705849|5.0|Bought this book for my little brother to read on the plane when we went on a trip. He had read all the others at school but they didnt not have this book. He was so excited to see that I had ordered it as a surprise and it kept him quiet and entertained the whole plane ride there and back.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|Outstanding film, the cast is top rate, and the plot is a two bagger ( popcorn with butter ).<br />The film is &#34; don't bring a knife to a gunfight' type of script. Twists and turns, comic relief, and a tad of bad violence lead<br />to a very &#34; YES &#34;  ending.<br /><br />  Thank you<br />  Dan Plas  at  danzoyd872176@hotmail.com
0142421715|1.0|Okay, I tried. I really did. I went into Crossed with an open mind after getting it from the library, even though I wasn't a big fan of Matched, I decided to give this series another try. But I'm beginning to think that it's meant for a certain type of person. Not to say that these are bad books - they're not - they're just not my cup of tea, personally.<br /><br />To begin with, it aggravated me that I constantly had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see who was narrating. I mean, obviously Ky and Cassia have different lives they think about, so for a while this wasn't a problem. But towards the middle and the end they sound exactly alike, like one mind, and not in the good way.<br /><br />Another pretty major issue I had with Crossed and Matched is that I simply do not care much about the characters. I feel like, if, in the middle of this novel, Cassia and Ky accidentally walked off a cliff, I would just say \\"Oh\\" and move on with my life. They are bland characters. She is boring. He is boring. They can go off and be boring together, I guess. I honestly didn't care if they lived or died. And I think that during a book you should feel connected to the characters or it's just going to feel really flat. So the fact that I couldn't make that connection really took away my enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />One thing I did enjoy were the side characters. I liked Indie. I liked Vick. I liked Eli and Hunter. They were more interesting than the main characters. Oh, and Xander. I like him, too. I am totally Team Xander in this series.<br /><br />Let me just say, I like poetry. Sometimes a good poem in a book can add a lot of depth or meaning or beauty to the story. And while this was sometimes the case with Crossed (Ally Condie really is capable of some beautiful writing), there were Just. Too. Many. It got to the point where I felt like, if one more poem was presented to me, I would tear out my hair in agony and frustration.<br /><br />This book was just slow paced in general, though. Where was the action? Where's the suspense? I do not know. There was no point in the novel that caused my heart to race, for me to get that I-gotta-know-what-happens-next feeling. No, it was more like the ugh-how-much-longer-is-this feeling that I hate. Reading should be fun, not an extreme exercise in patience. A lot of time, when I rate novels on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, I factor in how much I wanted to come back to the book. I did not want to keep picking up Cross. I wanted it to collect dust on my nightstand. The climax felt kind of dull to me. Like, \\"Oh, Cassia found the rebellion. Good for her. Only a few more pages to go now.\\"<br /><br />The ending of this was rather abrupt. Just a bad place to end a story, in my humble opinon.<br /><br />Also, we weren't given much more knowledge about the Society, like how they came to be and who runs it. Is there a president or something? I would like to know. Now, in dystopians like this where the author creates a world from scratch, it's understandable that we're not going to get how everything works in the first book. But the second? Yeah, I think there should be a little more information presented, and we should have a pretty clear idea of the Society. To me, they're still just one big question mark (that I'm in no hurry to recieve the answer about).<br /><br />If the third book in this triology ever comes my way, I might pick it up if there's nothing better for me to do.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|The game is fun but sometimes you get bored with it. And also I don't like the lives and the little critters that you have to kill.
0525478817|5.0|Okay. So. Aside from The Fault In Our Stars, I have not read anything by John Green. I see what a dumb decision that was now. After reading this amazing work of literature, I feel like running to the bookstore (even though it's midnight here) and buying everything else he's ever written.<br /><br />I have this thing set up here on Goodreads called a '2012 Reading Challenge'. This year, I decided to try and read 60 books, because last year I read 55. Now, I really want to complete said challenge. It gives me a nice feeling of accomplishment. The reason I mention this is because, sometimes, when I read a book, I'm counting the pages till it's over so I can move onto the next one and be closer to fulfilling my goal.<br /><br />But sometimes, I find a book that I just don't want to end. I want it to go on forever and ever; screw the reading challenge. I'm just gonna sit here and read The Fault In Our Stars for the rest of 2012. This was how I felt after completing the novel.<br /><br />I cried on and off during the book. I also laughed. Sometimes I laughed while I was crying. It was weird. But anyway, I love it when I read something that touches me so deeply. In my opinion, if a book brings out strong emotions in you, it must be good on some level. The humor and the sadness are mixed together so well - I believe Marcus Zusak had it right when he said \\"you laugh, you cry, and then you come back for more\\".<br /><br />The characters were quirky and they were fun. I adored Augustus and Hazel. And Isacc,too. Can't forget about him.<br /><br />All in all, even though it's still pretty early in the year, I have the distinct feeling that this book will be among my top five favorites of 2012. I can only hope that I find another book soon that lives up to the awesomeness of this one, because, at this very moment, I feel I may be underwhelmed by anything else.<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars is a solid five star book.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|A great gift for any little princess who just loves the Disney princesses!  My granddaughter is thrilled with them --- she decorated her room with them all by herself!  Now if she can just keep her little sister from peeling them off!  I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this product.
1250012570|4.0|On my own, this isn't a book that I would see and immediately think, \\"Oh My God, I have to read that!\\" But then, I need a little encouragement with most contemporary books, at least these days. Eleanor and Park looked cute enough, but then I started seeing all these raving reviews, and THEN I read something about John Green saying it was good, so of course I had to pick it up. It didn't take me long to figure out what all the fuss was about. There's something about this book that makes you feel like you have to keep going until the end - and then, when you get there, you wish it hadn't come quite so soon.<br /><br />I loved, loved, loved the main characters, who are, of course, Eleanor and Park. I loved seeing their relationship slowly develop from awkward seatmates on the bus, to sort-of friends, to being in love. Park is an easy character to like, just because he's funny and sweet. I connected more with Eleanor because of her sarcasm and such; I, too, am fond of sarcasm, and have red hair. Just her overall attitude reminded me so much of myself. And it wasn't just the two of them; I really liked Park's parents.<br /><br />I will be the first to admit that I didn't really get all the references spread throughout the story, but the ones I did get were awesome. And even though this novel does tackle a lot of serious issues, it had me laughing throughout.<br /><br />The only reason I'm taking off half a star is the ending. I realize that some authors like to leave it really open-ended, with just a hint that things are going to go in the right direction. But I'm kind of a spell-it-out type of person. I wish there had at least been an epilogue set a few weeks into the future, at the very least. I guess I'll have to content myself with imaginings about how the rest of Eleanor and Park's lives will play out.<br /><br />4.5 stars.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I saw the movie and loved it and had to read the book..enjoyed every min of it!! Couldn't put it down.
1250007208|5.0|Okay, so I'll be honest: going into this book, I was a little skeptical about how everything would play out. I mean, I'm all for fairytle retellings, but a cyborg Cinderella? Moon people? A big plague that has wiped out a big percentage of the population and New Bejing? Hmm . . . This is a very strange summary. How could all this possibly center around the classic story of Cinderella? You know, the slave of mean stepsisters and a stepmother that went to ball and left before midnight, leaving behind a glass slipper that the prince used to track her down?<br /><br />So, basically I was hoping that this novel would be amusing; I wasn't expecting to be blown away or anything. But, let me tell you, I WAS. Cinder was a strong and awesome heroine, and the whole plot really did follow the classic Cinderella nicely. This may be my new favorite retelling.<br /><br />I loved Kai. And I really felt for him; he was under so much presssure to do a good job at being Emporer, but Queen Levana was constantly manipulating him and trapping him. He was sweet and he was honorable, and his romance with Cinder was really quiet interesting. I'm looking forward to seeing how their relationship progesses, especially since the book ended with the pair being on such bad terms with each other.<br /><br />I also appreciated that one of the stepsisters, Peony, was actually Cinder's friend. And I liked knowing why the stepmother was so evil. I mean, in the original fairytale, she's just mean for apparently no reason. In Cinder, she's not the way she in for no reason. It really added depth to her character.<br /><br />I hear that the sequels are going to center around other fairytales, and I'm super excited to read them! Really looking forward to Scarlet - and the end of the series, where Queen Levana will hopefully go down in flames.<br /><br />This is a solid five star novel. I can't think of anything that annoyed me at all.
B0097K21YW|2.0|I wanted to like this.  I'm a huge Godzilla fan, so this should have been right up my alley.  I could excuse the crosshairs being a bit off.  If it is a clone of this or that, I couldn't say or care.<br /><br />On a Kindle Fire HD, the next/level select button is underneath the Kindle menu button.

With my Blackberry, both of those email addresses notified me through the email app. This app doesn't seem to do anything for a web mail account.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Excellent read wasn't able to put it down.  Very thought provoking......hard to really put yourself in that situation and truly know how you would react.
B004GCPJDQ|3.0|This Mobee product worked fantastic! I have had it for over 7 months with no issues at all! but the only thing is it has died and it says the battery is at 100% but it does not last long at all. I would say it lasts about the same amount of time with Duracell at 25%. It's a great idea, not a great design or performance.
0786109912|5.0|This is a great book! Francie, and the rest of the people populating the book seem totally real and remember-able. The streets and shops in Williamsburg are detailed. Which leads to my question: Why is the Broadway (Brooklyn) El, which dominates the area, not mentioned in the book?

B000E0LB7C|5.0|Backhaus has a very straightforward approach that sometimes sounds indifferent and matter-of-fact compared to other great interpreters of these works. However, there are qualities to his approach that I find hard to live without and even harder to describe in a simple statements, but I'll try. Backhaus extracts the simplicity in Beethoven and lays it down with a firmness and masculinity that somehow reflects the composer's personality that I read about in his biographies.  If there are mannerisms here, I think they're Beethoven's. Even his idiosyncrasies, such as his extra bass notes and arpeggiated chords are things that I can some how imagine the composer slipping in. I also love the way the music sounds like parlor playing, not 20th century concert hall playing. The intimacy and closed-in fullness of the recording, along with Backhaus's strong left hand certainly contribute to this sound. It's chunky, blocky, rhythmic, gruff - but it still manages to reveal everything that I've learned about these works in the past 30 years. He somehow really understood Beethoven. Again, I couldn't be without this set.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The most captivating book I've read in many many years! The solutions presented in some situations are just brilliant in their completenes.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This is the old Rod!! Rock'in new songs and beautiful ballads.  I put the CD in my car and have played it over and over.  Just shows talent knows no age.
1451695195|5.0|What I love about this book is not so much the subject matter, but because the author was a scientific professional/doctor, and  the fact that most people will not accept someone's testimonial on NDE (Near Death Experiences) unless they have been a skeptic, scientist, non-believer, etc.  This book is reaching millions of people around the world as the #1 NY Times Besteller which shows how many people are awakening to these higher truths that death is NOT the finality of life, but only a new beginning into a life that is much less limited and expansive than what we experience here in 3D.  It is time for humanity to awaken to their inner spirit and realize that our true Self are not these physical bodies, which temporarily house the indwelling soul and spirit.  I am very grateful for Eben Alexander that he has shared his profound journey with humanity at the crucial time of humanity's awakening from the slumber of illusion.
B007JZGIMS|5.0|Rocket Player is a terrific music player for the Android os.  This unlocker gives you the premium version of the player.  The improved graphic equalizer is worth $4 by itself.  The sound is truly wonderful.  The additional capabilities are nice too.  I mostly bought it because the developer deserves to be rewarded for such good work.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app works fine for me. So much more info than relying on tiny battery on kindle. Thanks for the freebie!
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|This my favorite music player for the Android os.  It delivers superb playback, the controls are highly intuitive, and the equalizer presets are very well designed.  If you have Rocket player, you won't need any other music player for your mp3 music collection.<br /><br />If you are looking for a free internet radio player on the other hand, this app is not what you are looking for.  This player is designed to provide a high quality playback system for people who actually own their own music collections.  It is not intended to compete with Spotify, Pandora or anything of that sort.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|We are Tarentino fans, but were very disappointed with Django.  We felt that the plot was incredibly predictable and that there was just too much blood spray.

B004SRNH10|4.0|This is good. I have enjoyed this.  This product is helpful and usefully.  I would recommend this to others. HELPFUL
B00AO2TREY|5.0|I found amusing how those guys are not playing massively in North America. In \\"Exile\\" they still deliver high quality pop, with \\"Blind\\" and \\"Sandman\\", but the cherry on top of the cake goes to \\"Somebody To Die For\\" and \\"Help\\". This album is one of those that has no bad songs at all, lots of meaninful lyrics and probably became an all time favorite of me. If you didn't have a chance to listen to them, you can check on you tube their songs and you will understand why this album is that good.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|You are able to check on different people and what they are talking about. You can also tweet your friends.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I could not put this down and have read it 3 times now while I wait for the next book in the series.  The characters are well developed and the story is rich in detail.  It is one of my favorite fantasy books of all time.  Now, if Mr. Sanderson would please release the next book, I can stop rereading this one and going through withdrawal. :-)
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|For years now I've wanted to buy the original series but the DVD and BluRay versions were just too expensive for me to justify.  I had streaming Netflix to hold me over and that sufficed for a while.  Finally I saw the price on Amazon drop to a level that I thought was a really good value so I pulled the trigger.  Damn I'm glad I did.  The BluRay set looks and sounds GREAT!  And, on top of that, this set works for both purists and those of us who enjoy the &#34;remastered&#34; versions as you get BOTH!  I've watched the entire first season so far and the quality is very consistent.  Every episode is nice and sharp with spectacular color.  You simply cannot go wrong with this set.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is great! So much better than the website - just wish I could see my eBay Bucks balance in the app instead of having to go to the site!
B009R659L8|5.0|It is a good read that holds your interest until the very end. Mary Higgins Clark always keeps you entertained.
B008KRBTU0|5.0|We have the original spot it and spot it jr. When I saw this game, I immediately purchased it. My 4.5 year old daughter has been reluctant to learn how to start sounding out words. This has made it into a fun game for us! We don't play it in the usual manner of spot it but have adjusted it.<br /><br />When we first started it, I would tell her this is the word can you find the pic that goes with it. She would sound it out and be very happy when she would get it. After she got better on that I would tell her which card had the word and which card had the pic. Now she is getting to the point where she can play it without needing to always be told which card has the word on it, some she recognizes, some she identifies based on pattern and other times sounding them all out.<br /><br />If you have never played any of the spot it games, do not buy this first. Get the original version first, have your child love that one before starting on this one.
B00BOQPSGU|5.0|This is truly my favorite book! One I'll return to again and again. I've watched the movie with Colin Firth to many times to count. I find I learn something new every time. Reading the book has only increased my understanding of the dialogue in which only Jane Austen could write. It gives you a greater sense of the feelings and thoughts of the character which only adds to the story. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading this book or watching the Colin Firth version of the movie do yourself a favor and make up a big batch of popcorn and put your pajamas on and enjoy an enchanting moment in time!
1452105111|5.0|Great garlands!  I can't believe that they were priced at about $12 and I was able to spell out \\"Happy First Birthday\\" and my son's name.  Great quality!  I was looking to purchase a similar birthday banner on Etsy for almost three times the price when I stumbled across this set on Amazon.  I also love that I can re-use the garlands for other events since although they are the Eric Carle colors/theme, if you didn't use any of the illustrated pieces, others might not realize and just think they were fun primary colored letters. Great purchase, great price, good quality!

B00BESM14U|5.0|One of my favorite books turned into one of my favorite movies. The cast did incredibly well and they did a good job of following the book and not mutilating it like some book to movie translations(Eregon...).
B004TI1WME|5.0|I love this because it allow you to see with little effort when something is incorrectly entered. Also love it because you can copy the calculations.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|You really have to pay attention to this game. I wish I could spend more time at tis game but I watch my 4 year old granddaughter and she takes a lot of time.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|As always, awesome vocals by Cornell. Great song writing (very unique and fresh but still Sound Garden). Very clever guitar work that was missing during the Audio slave years (BTW, I love Audio slave).  I'm so glad that Sound Garden reunited and made another album. Don't hesitate to make this purchase.  You won't regret it.  In all honesty, I listened it to the whole thing once and then again a week later.  On the third listen, everything came alive and I haven't played much else since.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Great movie. Great for a young female audience. Lots of laughs. Harrison ford is excellent. Rachel is endearing. Would watch again.
0743243153|5.0|One of the reviews on the back of the book says that this book is a great gift to the world. I wish this was required reading; maybe the world would be a better place.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Good movie...very interesting...and different.  I recommend it for sure.  If you like to see films that are DO NOT use the typical &#34;Hollywood&#34; movie formula...I think you'll like this movie.
B00004Y6NX|4.0|Quality is timeless if you are a fan of Dire Straits. If you are not a fan this CD could just change your mind . The music and recording quality are both good to the extreme.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I really like this game and my 10 year old daughter and I play it together. The only downside is that some of the requirements have to be done w  gems and you have to pay for that many.  Other than that we love it
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Have owned the platter for a long time and now Amazon has released the re-issue of the CD. Almost as good as the platter for you LP purists out there.
B00004Y6NT|4.0|Proving that old stuff still has a lot of entertainment value. The digital quality of this re-issue is top notch and worth every penny.
B00A83075M|5.0|The storyline was deep and intelligent enough for adults to appreciate it, but not so much so that it was above a small child's head. The retro throwbacks-- adorable. And Fix it Felix and Vanelope and Calhoun were very much just Jack McBrayer and Sarah Silverman and Jane Lynch in animated form-- the personality shone completely through all three.<br />And, of course, how could you not love Ralph, the anti-hero of the story?  The old video game jokes were cute, but the fact that the \\"bad guys\\" went to \\"Bad anon\\" like alcoholic anonymous? That was hilarious. (Though, when he was clutching his cookie medal and saying the creedo? I CRIED...)<br />This hearkens back to the old Rankin Bass in that Misfits have a place too, but, it's more than that. It's about yes, everyone has their place, but YOU decide who YOU are. It was a beautiful movie and message. Loved it, loved it, and my kids have watched it eight times since getting it last Sunday (it's Friday)!<br />I think the part that choked me up the most was when he was talking about how if that one little girl loved him, he couldn't be SUCH a bad guy... and truly, Ralph WAS a hero. Cannot recommend this enough.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Proving that Quality is better than quantity. This album proves that a few excellent songs is better than a lot of mediocrity. A real joy to listen to if you are a real Dire Straits fan.
B001FA0W5W|5.0|Do not doubt the seriousness of this somewhat tongue-in-cheek - with a good dose of sarcasm - look at the world we actually live in.  Once you've read it you will look at the world a little differently, and many of your 'expert' friends and colleagues will suddenly appear to be just lucky fools.  You may even discover that you are as much fooled by randomness as they are; in fact, if you think you're not, you most likely are!<br />The book is outstanding with enough subtle complexity that even re-reading it is as rewarding as it was reading it for the first time - the mark of a classic.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|For an easy, yet intelligent game, I HIGHLY  recommend Quell.  Best dollar I've spent in a long time! Looking forward to finishing it...
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Got this for $13 from Amazon used warehouse, but it was brand new when I received it.  I can fit 2 bodies, a 70-200 and about 2 more lenses in it.  Fits better on the back of a little kid though.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I purchased the Blu-Ray copy as I use a projector to view them. When you are filling a 120&#34; wall it really helps to have that extra bitrate on your side. Colors, framerate, and fluidity of motion is beautiful.<br /><br />There's also a story line associated with the movie... I guess that was cool too.
B001LOPYHI|4.0|This is one of the very first Sci-fi films I saw in a movie theater.... I was blown away, to say the least.  The fact that I'm willing to pay $ to see it again, should answer the doubters... it is [and always will be, in my book] a terrific social commentary...
1400069289|1.0|I had originally heard about the habit loop from Life Hacks.  I was very excited about this as I thought this was going to illustrate some conditioning techniques.  I was personally wanting to use this book coupled with other books to improve my studying, eating, and exercising habits.  What I had hoped this nearly 300 page book would be about was how to achieve this.  Instead it's a lot of anecdotal stories about who has good habits and who has bad habits.  It's almost as if the author's idea was to list a name of famous people we've all heard of to validate his \\"technique\\" but left out the chapter where it really breaks it all down.  Oh no wait...that was the appendix right?  The 6 page instructional breakdown that's the equivalent of a Dick and Jane book.<br /><br />Here let me break this down for you.  We have literally 250 pages about Tony Dungy, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Target, Starbucks, and the successful people who run those places.

Does he wear pastel purple when promoting Stillness speaks, or pastel orange when he promotes New earth?  I think I need to go shopping and get all three colors then maybe I can laugh all the way to the bank also.

B00AIBZM40|4.0|Producer Guillermo Del Toro teams up with first time director Andy Muschietti to bring us this first rate little creepy horror film. Oscar nominated actress Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau star in this thriller about a businessman who kills his co-workers, his wife then abducts his two little daughters and drives them to an isolated cabin in the deep woods. Five years later, the girls are found, but living in a feral state, and slowly integrated into normal society by a child psychiatrist. Their uncle and his goth-rock girlfriend adopt the girls and attempt to give them a semblance of a normal life.....yet all is now what it seems....because in all those years, a ghostly apparition they called \\"MAMA\\" watched over them, and she's a bit possessive!!! Megan Carpentier and Isabelle Nelisse, as Victoria and Lilly, are amazing in their roles. You sympathieze with them and at times, fear them as well. In Mama, we get a wonderful and terrifying presence that's not too over the top! And when we find out the motive to why she protects the girls, it strikes a deep note in the viewer. Deep scares abound. I liked this movie a lot!
178211002X|4.0|I rather like Simon's cat, and even though the second and third book were not as fresh as the first one, this one has recovered some of that charm.<br /><br />What sets this book apart is that it has larger pages and everything is a colored drawing. This clearly makes this much more effort for Tofield and there are far fewer pages, maybe a third of what the previous books had. Also, where other books had some evolving scenes, here every \\"event\\" is a single drawing.<br /><br />As before, the cats and other animals alternate between being cats and other animals and being stand-ins for children or humans. Whilst to me this always takes me aback when I consider that cats can't do some of these things, and the change from the being cats to stand-ins is sudden, but I appreciate it, and it is part of the charm after all.<br /><br />Is the book funny, yes it is. Is the art beautiful, yeah, probably the best looking Simon's Cat yet. Is it short? Yes, very very short, you can flick through this in fifteen minutes and even though you will revisit it (possibly with your kids if they like the mischievous cat) it went by too quickly. But then, to be realistic, all of these books are too short, though we know that going in so you can't really mark it down for that, still this one is especially short and thus it is a shame that at the time of writing Amazon isn't listing a page count.

B003EYVXT6|4.0|The movies that get made are about 99% the same. I don't mean Star Wars == Fight Club, but Star Wars is very much a Samurai flick and Fight Club's twist has been so overdone for a while I dreaded watching thrillers. It all comes down to formula, and there are a few, which is probably more evident to me as I was just trying to find a generally known film to name against Star Wars that doesn't share the same features.<br /><br />This is a film that doesn't operate solely on what you see, rather it is based on the characters' character. Their ego is played against their flaws and their identity against their desires. The two main characters are Clive and Elsa, both highly regarded scientists working on (or in fact beyond) the forefront of their field which is genetic engineering. For reasons that are never fully explained (though heavily implied) they create a genetic sequence including human DNA, which clearly is a taboo issue. Things play out as they must for this to get started and although you constantly expect at least Clive to do the right (necessary) thing, this is a 104 minute film, and because you saw the trailers, you know he's not going to.<br /><br />The first hour of the movie is generally tense as you don't know how things are going to evolve and you are constantly expecting something to go terribly wrong and it does, but you'll have to watch it. This is all very skillfully done and if you've seen Natali's earlier movie Cube, it follows a very similar development arc.<br /><br />After that hour a lot of things become quite clear, and then there is the finale, and that's an experience onto itself.<br /><br />What makes Splice special are a few things:<br />1) The characters feel alive. I don't mean they are well acted (which they are) but rather that they have an existence outside the movie plot itself. This doesn't feel like it is a gimmick (and it should not be anyway) but works in well with the story.<br />2) The movie doesn't linger, instead it constantly progresses through what it is trying to convey. At no point do you feel it is spending time on something, rather it does what it needs to without outstaying its welcome.<br />3) It is topical without being preachy, it does make some statements about corporate motives and such, but as already mentioned it doesn't linger, and when it makes them, it is in the context of the story. As for the evils of genetic engineering, that doesn't float as a topic, rather it is about the human element in this.<br />4) At no point do you feel that science is being manipulated / simplified to fit the story, the way I find grating when IT is portrayed. That said, I don't know about genetic engineering and scientists might cringe, though what's shown on screen presents a good visual analogue for what is happening. Sure, it is simplified, but it doesn't feel dreadfully so. More importantly though, the science is part of the setting rather than the plot, and the story is about human factors more than science. It should be mentioned here, IF it were about cold, hard and unfeeling science, this probably would not play out as it does, but no one wants to see that movie.<br /><br />So let's look at the flaws. The movie is not for everyone, there is nothing I can point to as being \\"bad\\", except some hollow statements about Dren's visual evolution, and the Elsa character being entirely unlikeable, some of it will make sense in the long run, but some facets are not explained especially one statement Clive makes which really left me hanging. My main problem is the ethics are too blatantly ignored. Essentially, the plot is just a little too convenient to get started, though once again without this there would be no film.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a creature horror flick, that feels intense pretty much all the way through. It works on a few levels, with things that are happening existing in a whole world rather than just the movie. There are no \\"convenient\\" surprises, and you will consider some of the facets for a while. If you can take the tension and want something that will give you something to think about, this is a movie to try.der some of the facets for a while. If you can take the tension and want something that will give you something to think about, this is a movie to try.

B001LYD2K4|5.0|I'm a recent huge UFO fan that decided to venture into MSG to see what they had to offer. The first album was a solid offering with some incredible songs and this one absolutely smokes. It seems as the song writing is a bit tighter and I love the production of this CD unlike what a few other reviewers had stated. My favorite tracks being the first three and the 7th. I have not listened to the UFO tracks yet but it seems to me it would be very hard to hold up to the original. Unfortunately the third album seems to have lost the magic with a different lead singer and more choppy slower songs. If you like heavy metal and rock you cannot go wrong with the first two.

B00B5A9FLY|5.0|To say I am a fan of the show is an understatement.  Hands down, it's the best show out there.  Unfortunately, it was the last of the 5 series that will be aired and to say I am disappointed is also an understatement.  So it is only natural that I would buy the last of the series on DVD.  Of course it goes well with my Merlin Series 1-4 DVDs.<br />This season is the best of the group.  All the episodes are exciting and leaves you wanting it to go longer than the scheduled times for that episode.  Each of the 13 episodes tie in all the loose ends from previous seasons and it is done well.<br />Although, I wanted to have Merlin reveal who he is to Arthur right from the get go in this series, it doesn't happen until later.  Too late if you ask me.  The first 2 episodes are action packed.  Episode 3 was terrific with Anthony Head coming back to this show.  Episode 4 and 10 brought back some previous actors/actresses. Episode 5, to me, was the turning point and fates were sealed.  It's one of my favorite episodes.  These fates will be shown in episodes 11-13.  The only sorta slow episodes were 6-9, but they tied in Morgana's/Gwen's parts according to the legend.  They are still great episodes.  The last three are where the real action comes in.  It completes the story line of the great legend of King Arthur and Camelot.  Note to oneself... store lots of Kleenex to use for the final episode.<br />The entire cast should be very proud of their accomplishments because each and everyone of them delivered their best this season.  Colin Morgan (Merlin) has set the bar for one of the best young actors, worldwide...IMHO.  To say he is anything less than brilliant would be gross misjudgment on anyone's part.  To prove my point, Colin earned the best actor award for 2013 beating out all other highly favorite British actors.  An accomplishment that was not suppose to happen...but did.  He has come so far and it is so good to see someone who deserves the best get the best acknowledgement.  Colin IS the main reason I watched Merlin for 5 years straight.  Bradley James (Arthur) was magnificent and without his presence, the show wouldn't have reached it's full potential.  Katie McGrath was perfect to play the part of Morgana.  She really portrayed the evil, high priestess well.  Richard Wilson (Gaius), never better as he was in this series.  So glad to see they kept him a constant in the 5 series.  The newcomer, Alexander Vlahos (Mordred), was perfect in his role.  He (to me) was the one character who was so vital in this series and Alex contributed so much to his part.  Very talented and not to mention he has such stunning blue eyes.<br />As I write this review, I realize that it should be on the product (DVD) itself, but for some reason, I feel it's more important to write about the series.  I will add that the DVD was shipped fast and I bought it at a good price ($29.99).  I definitely got my money's worth and then some.  There is no other show, TV or DVD I would rather watch.  I will continually watch Merlin, starting from Series 1, episode 1 all the way to Series 5, episode 13.  It never gets boring and re-watching it, I pick up more each time.  Classic legend with a relatively modern twist, makes this show the #1 show...ever (to me)!!<br />I will miss this show deeply and pray that the cast will come back at some point to make a movie or a TV show...even if it is for one night.  The cast and crew from England made one terrific legend into a five year brilliant TV show.  BBC, you outdid yourself and I am so glad I was able to enjoy Merlin each airing week.<br />Thank you Merlin cast, creators, producers, and all involved for making the last 5 years the best ever TV entertainment for this US citizen.<br /><br />Well done Merlin, well done.ment.

B002SRQ214|4.0|I have a HP retail desktop I purchased in 2010.  Typically there are very few upgrade paths available for retail systems.  Usually it's a generic motherboard tailored by Foxconn or other foreign manufacturers to the PC manufacturers specifications.  In my case, my system was upgradable to this processor.  I of course had to drop a new power supply in, as the stock 250W was just not good enough.<br /><br />The packaging was nice, survived shipping with no issues and appeared well secured and protected.  The processor itself came as advertised.  The only problem I ran into, was the stock fan.  My computer only has a 3 pin CPU fan connector and the stock fan that shipped with it was 4 pin, with no adapter.  So I had to purchase a separate system fan/cooler.  This processor does run rather warm if you don't have appropriate airflow.  However, every AMD processor I've purchased seems to run warmer than the Intel equivalent.<br /><br />While the processor can be overclocked, I did not overclock it.  My chief concerns of course having more to do with stability and longevity than speed.  All in all for a drop in replacement processor for this off the shelf system, it runs well and performs as advertised.

To be able to travel over the world, rob banks-unsavory though that may be; and to win over your childhood sweetheart all makes for a good story. That the jumper got away with the lavish lifestyle for so many years was stretchy at best, but then the story would have made different story. Overall It has enough action and villiany to make it interesting and fun to watch.

B005FISBV2|5.0|After reading all of the reviews about the 2 minute \\"Showtime Promo\\" at the beginning and making sure not to read any spoilers, I ordered the season six Blu-ray. I figured that I would somehow avoid it when it popped up. As it turned out, my luck had changed. There was \\"NO\\" promo, nothing. It just went straight to the menu. I didn't look for spec features or anything I just watched every minute of every episode. I thank everyone for warning me and especially thank those that complained enough to the powers that be. It worked. I got to watch the season. After the final scene I almost called 911 because I actually had an extremely serious panic attack, anxiety attack or even a minor heart attack. Not to mention the fact that I needed to change drawers. Thanks for making it so I could actually enjoy the season finale. Tomorrow night I begin watching season 7 and have not read anything about it so nothing can spoil it for me. Season six truly was the return of Dexter, worth 5 times what I paid for it. Now with the anticipation of the season 7 1st episode raising my blood pressure, I am wondering how I am going to deal with the end of season 7 and then the end of season 8 which will be the end of Dexter. No show or movie has ever gotten to me like this and I hope one day there will be something to being as well written, acted and produced. One can dream, right? I am glad that I do not have Showtime right now because I like being able to just watch it when I want, as many times as I want. Michael C Hall is one of the few that have taken chances with their career choices, from Kissing men to killing them. Like Christopher Meloni, running around a prison naked kissing and well, uhem guys to arresting them as Stabler and saving the world as an animated Green Lantern. Then there's Jake G. Brokeback to......

0670014893|4.0|I've been waiting somewhat impatiently for this one ever since seeing the announcement of its publication. Le Carr&eacute; is, in my experienced estimation, one of the greatest stylists writing in the English language during the past half-century -- and that's how long he's been turning out exquisite works of fiction, too, beginning with the introduction of the inestimable George Smiley in Call for the Dead in 1961. Among other things, he's a master of the present tense masquerading as past tense, which isn't easy to pull off. Le Carr&eacute;, naturally, makes the technique invisible.<br /><br />Le Carr&eacute; is best known, of course, for his spy stories set in the Cold War, but there are other issues of interest to him in the modern world. When George Bush responded to the 9/11 attacks by invading Iraq, a country which nothing whatever to do with it, Le Carr&eacute; joined a number of other noted writers in publically denouncing not only the resulting war but Tony Blair's willing complicity in it. That brought about the downfall of New Labour, among other things, and the rise of what it took us awhile to recognize as the insinuation of private corporations into the province of government. War for profit has now become amoral big business, and that's the background of this story and the substance of the author's literary warnings.<br /><br />Kit Probyn is a moderately senior Foreign Office careerist, a \\"low-flyer\\" waiting out his last years until retirement (\\"his future is behind him,\\" as they say), when he's summoned to the office of the junior minister of state and recruited to be the government's observing representative in the planned kidnapping of a supposed terrorist in Gibraltar. There will be a squad of Special Services men there, but the main action will be handled by a group of mercenaries employed by an international security corporation out of Houston. Of course, Kit isn't told everything, or even the truth about anything.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Toby Bell, a much younger rising star in the diplomatic corps, and private secretary to the junior minister in question, is becoming nervous about the way his boss has shut him out of everything. That's now how things are supposed to work and he fears the worst. His ethical and moral scruples are going to get him into serious trouble, as he pokes into things he ought not.<br /><br />The didactic plot and the characters are subtle and complex and the story will entertain you in a thoroughly spine-chilling way as the author makes you aware of the unpleasant truths of the modern world. And if he sometimes teeters on the brink of polemic, well, . . . I don't have a problem with that. (Parts of the book may remind you of The Looking Glass War in flavor.) But he never descends to caricature, in my opinion, and he certainly doesn't believe in happy endings. Le Carr&eacute; is well into his 80s now but I hope he has another dozen books in him.ll, a much younger rising star in the diplomatic corps, and private secretary to the junior minister in question, is becoming nervous about the way his boss has shut him out of everything.

193700788X|3.0|I usually try not to read too many reviews of a book before I write my own so as not to be influenced by others' opinions. This time, however, I couldn't help myself; I had to peek to see if other readers felt a distinct lack of emotion for this final installment into our beloved Sookie's tale. And while I won't go so far as to say this is the worst book ever written, I will agree with the reviews I've read:  I am very disappointed overall.<br /><br />There are some things I liked about Dead Ever After, so I will state them first. I liked the fact that I got to spend time with characters I've grown to know and love, including Mr. Cataliades, Diantha, Pam and Bill (despite his flaws). I liked that Sookie realized she has friends she can call on who will help her, no questions asked. I liked that there was resolution for Claude.  Wait...I'm trying to think of more things.  Oh, and despite my overall lack of enthusiasm, the story did move along fairly quickly and I kept turning the pages to see what would happen next. That's a positive, right?<br /><br />But oh my gosh, the problems. This is going to be spoiler-y, so consider yourselves warned.<br /><br />I'll start small. After being in financial straits for so long, suddenly Sookie receives a bequest from Claudine that will basically take care of her for life? Wow. How nice. Oh, that nasty break-up with Quinn? It's in the past and all's forgiven. That convoluted murder and arrest? Never would've happened, even if Alcee had not been under the influence of a voodoo object. Amelia's father wanting the cluviel for simply to control Amelia? Yeah, right. And where was Bubba?<br /><br />But then...the Eric situation. It was handled so badly, even with the lead up from the last book, that it was unbelievable. These two loved each other madly, and yet Eric couldn't and wouldn't find a way to get out of the marriage with Freyda? I understand the problems with an ongoing relationship between an immortal vampire and a  human, but there would have been something Eric would've done. For him to ride off into the sunset, even with his token gifts, was totally unacceptable, even if I did see it coming. And the non-chemistry between Sookie and Sam, no matter how much Sookie tried to make it sound wonderful, was anything but. Sookie would not, under any circumstances, have simply let go of Eric and moved on so quickly.<br /><br />If I keep writing, I'm going to talk myself out of the three stars I'm giving this final novel. I wanted to love it, I was expecting closure, and hoping to at least like Sam and Sookie together, and got none of it. Let's just say I'll give it 2.5 stars and round it up for old times' sake.t there would have been something Eric would've done.

It didn't take long for me to realize that these guys are incredible musicians! They lured me in real quick and now I appreciate how the vocals work with the music. They turned me on to checking out other similar bands.  I've looked hard but haven't found anyone better. Converge is a special treat for those who appreciate detail and complexity in what they listen to.  This is a great album and great compliment to their previous releases.  Just please keep it up and stay real... that's all I have to say.

0307951529|4.0|This is a good book. I've found the content to be actionnable and very practical. If you want to be even more inspired and more thorough I'd recommand Tim Ferriss' Four Hour Work Week.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|well i read this book last out of all his books and i did love it but i could see how much better his following harry hole books are. one of the best crime writers ever.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This program works well for me. Lets me know how long my battery will last with different functions. Comes on every time you plug your phone in though which may be a problem for some.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the best book I have ever read.  If u r thinking of turning it down cause of all the blood and violence<br />That's SILLY<br />Read the book you won't be disappointed I guarantee it
B0063IH60K|4.0|like most other reviewers I like the game but tire of the constant ads. cannot complain too much since it was free.
1439102813|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I will read more by this author. I've recommended to several friends who have Alzheimer's in family.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|dont really use it that much still go to google on the web  need to play with it a little more and see if i like it
B004WMKSH2|5.0|The Harry Potter series as most people know is one of the best stories to ever. So what are you waiting for? Go watch Part one of the final chapter in this fantastic magical world
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Great movie. Makes you think. I never saw the earlier Star Treks, but it seems as if they stayed very true to the characters. Very entertaining. Good action but not too over the top. Love you, Spock :)
B005IQ39AY|1.0|Not that good of a game it just don't have ant thing exciting to do but bubbles do not recommend it is boring to play
B005XLN97M|4.0|My girls also love this product.  They use it in conjunction with the 3 storey Barbie Dream Townhouse and works because I have two girls, however not necessary to have two of them.
B0064QNS62|3.0|Have not figured out to play this game it looks like it could be fun.Will try to play it again sometime
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I watched the first 10 min of this movie and turned it off. The worst remake of any movie. They better not touch Back to the Future.
B008Y79IUE|4.0|This movie was well produced.  The acting was very convincing.  Its one of those movies that leaves you feeling haunted for likely years to come. The story hits on an all too common scenario that perhaps many see all the time and others can see into a world that exists outside of their comfy suburban lives.  Highly recommend this one
1433502429|4.0|Since translation/interpretation is largely personal preference, I will not discuss the ESV translation itself here.<br /><br />First as a product, this bible is well constructed.  The faux leather binding is soft but durable.  The letters ESV are embossed into the spine ant the rest of the text is in gold paint.  The gold painted page edges aren't perfect, but they do look nice. They were mostly stuck together when the bible was new.  Some of the stitching around the edge of the cover has started to come undone, but it doesn't appear to be structural.<br /><br />Now for the annotations, They are quite complete, and sometimes take up more than half the page.  They are easy enough to understand. If you can read the text, you can read the annotations. The color maps and pictures are nice but occasionally feel intrusive.(a few of them take up multiple pages).
0060755598|4.0|Disappointed i bought new and there are disc that wont play it skips kinda feel ripped off  Three more words
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun for beginners and for more advanced with the time challenge.  Seems to be enough variety and skill levels.  Recommend for kids as well as adults.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I was late in discovering the big bang theory. My granddaughter got me wactching it. I ordered this dvd to see the beginning. I was not disappointed. I have no complaints at all.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter is a great source for tracking breaking news with insightful news analyses. It is also a fascinating way to track the sublimely ridiculous commentary of the powerful but stupid.
B007MDQW3W|3.0|This is an eleatic sound where sometimes the music and voice do not match....while I enjoyed it is not an album we play often.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|What an incredible story. I had never read Nicholas Sparks before this. I had watched the movies, but never the books. His writing is so easy to follow and the story doesn't drag on. It was perfectly spaced out and the right amount of pages. Amazing.
B00BBQXQFI|3.0|I got this for my 3 year old thinking she would love all the characters, I was wrong she probably watched bits and pieces of it here and there but it never held her attention for more then a few minutes.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Only show I can watch these days. It's fiction folks. And even with its gore, it has excellent plot and conflict. More filling than the dry and horrific reality TV that pollutes the public these days. Now in HD!!
015626224X|5.0|Orwell's story is this: He was in Paris and had trouble finding work. He went hungry, and eventually found a job (while waiting for work in a restaurant that was to open), and then worked in that restaurant when it opened. Then he went to England to work, but he had to endure a month having to depend on charity before this job was ready. Orwell is excellent at cooly describing the small details that make up one's life. And he is competent at writing specifically enough that I have concrete pictures in my head of the places and people about which he writes. Even when he describes the sky, for which other writers pull out a thesaurus of colors and variations of words like incandescent or iridescent, he says sparingly: \\"The sky was like a vast flat wall of cobalt, with roofs and spires of black paper pasted upon it.\\"<br /><br />The street artist (screever) Bozo that Orwell meets while a tramp in London is the only fully admirable character in the book. Although homeless, he has more desires than how to find cigarettes, food, and a bed for that day, which are the only goals the other tramps Orwell writes about have. Bozo doesn't seem to have a plan to become rich or even to ever not be homeless, but he cares about the world. \\"Well, you got to take an interest in something. It don't follow that because a man's on the road he can't think of anything but tea-and-two-slices.\\" (Chapter XXX; tea and two slices is tea and two slices of toast with margarine, which is the basic diet of most tramps in Orwell's story.) \\"He had managed to keep his brain intact and alert, and so nothing could make him succumb to poverty. He might be ragged and cold, or even starving, but so long as he could read, think and watch for meteors, he was, as he said, free in his own mind.\\"<br /><br />I am delighted by Orwell's method of describing particulars and then giving a concise generalization of what he has been talking about. Perhaps I am wrong, but I feel that Orwell does not come up with these generalizations first, but describes what he has experienced and then distills them. This is a better way of writing (and probably a better way of thinking) than having some vague general idea that you try to illustrate with whatever examples you can think of. Some of the instances I circled while reading this book:<br /><br />\\"The Paris slums are a gathering-place for eccentric people- people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent. Poverty frees them from ordinary standards of behaviour, just as money frees people from work.\\" (Chapter I)<br /><br />\\"For, when you are approaching poverty, you make one discovery which outweighs some of the others. You discover boredom and mean complications and the beginnings of hunger, but you also discover the great redeeming feature of poverty: the fact that it annihilates the future.\\" (Chapter III)<br /><br />\\"Is a plongeur's [dish washer] work really necessary to civilisation? We have a feeling that it must be 'honest' work, because it is hard and disagreeable, and we have made a sort of fetish of manual work. We see a man cutting down a tree, and we make sure that he is filling a social need, just because he uses his muscles; it does not occur to us that he may only be cutting down a beautiful tree to make room for a hideous statue.\\" (Chapter XXII)<br /><br />\\"Tramps are cut off from women, in the first place, because there are very few women at their level of society. One might imagine that among destitute people the sexes would be as equally balanced as elsewhere. But it is not so; in fact, one can almost say that below a certain level society is almost entirely male.... It is obvious what the results of this must be: homosexuality, for instance, and occasional rape cases. But deeper than these there is the degradation worked in man who knows that he is not even considered fit for marriage. The sexual impulse, not to put it any higher, is a fundamental impulse, and starvation of it can be almost as demoralising as physical hunger. The evil of poverty is not so much that it makes a man suffer as that it rots him physically and spiritually. And there can be no doubt that sexual starvation contributes to this rotting process. Cut off from the whole race of women, a tramp feels himself degraded to the rank of a cripple or a lunatic. No humiliation could do more damage to a man's self-respect.\\" (Chapter XXXVI)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book for kids and adults any age I really don't know what else's to write so ok bye now.

B00908DDZM|3.0|I really loved the song &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; so I expected to love the CD.  It's OK, just not what I expected.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Really works extremely well.  Organized and very intuitive.  As a new Android user, I really appreciated how easy it was to learn to use.
B0028R3G5O|5.0|I grew up listening to Cyndi Lauper and absolutely love this CD.  I always love when an artist compiles a best hits album.  That way I can listen to my faves on one CD.
0143122061|5.0|This really is an important book. Wish all lawyers would read it, as it touches on the chaos they have created in the process of building the foundations of personal protection and property, then the morass of what is left when it becomes the playground of the great American lottery of &#34;Sue the bastards&#34;.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Very useful and easy to use. Like to have option of off line access to certain files. I used it on every devices, I phone, I pad, kindle fire, pc computers, desktops, laptops.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|It was a very interesting book,written in the 1800's.<br />It had a most interesting twist<br />I enjoyed reading it all they way to the end.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can't wait for more of this game! So addicting! Very challenging and fun. I'm going to go through withdrawl without it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Nikola Tesla may be the greatest Engineer of our time.  ...and, by the way, a true scientist as well. This book is a true and excellent compilation of Tesla's achievements and adds to the complete knowledge of this man. My 7 year old daughter is reading it now, and she is stimulated enough from reading about Tesla to ask more and more questions about him and his amazing designs.  This is the kind of book that also teaches us all to think critically.  We need to see more critical thinking skills in our education. This book does that.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I would like this game even more if we could trade cards with other players hence the word trading card game...
0446615641|4.0|In the 3rd book of the Camel Club, Oliver Stone and crew go to new levels.  I could barely turn the pages fast enough.<br /><br />It is clearly written, with a well incorporated plot. Once I think I know where the story is going, Baldacci is very talented at creating a page turner.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This has to be the most rushed, slapped together book I've ever read. I even question if Ms Harris even wrote this book or turned it over to a ghost writer because she was bored w/Sookie. I would not recommend this book to anyone & if I can get my money back from Amazon I will. Such a sad way to end such wonderful characters.
B0085RZGYU|4.0|I have never been so shocked at the ending of a book.<br /><br />It takes a lot of courage for the author to put this ending into his series.  Stone is caught in a web of lies, as the dark secrets of his past keep rearing their ugly heads.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  It is well written and fun story
1451675046|3.0|NOt a bad book, you could learn something, but don't expect the high standard typical of Dawkin's book. Nothing spectacular, you'll probably already know everything in the book. Basic science it is.
0446615625|5.0|This was the first Baldacci book that I've read. It was a good choice.  Oliver Stone and his gang of merry men were fun loving and their adventures were impressive.<br /><br />It was a great mystery for this unsuspecting group to solve.  His characters are engaging, complex and you get the sense that there is more to their stories than meet the eyes.<br /><br />I couldn't read this fast enough<br /><br />This is the 1st book in a series now of 5 books
B00ADLCC9I|1.0|I bought this despite all the poor reviews.  The second I turned it on, I saw a bright red stuck pixel nearly in the center of the screen.  I knew I was going to be returning it, so I was disappointed instantly.  The unit feels cheap, if you press on the back while holding it, the lcd will swirl in colors on the front, indicating that it is being pressed on.<br /><br />I updated the firmware, which supposedly fixes simultaneous button presses, but it did not within all apps.  It just isn't worth $180.  Also, the viewing angle from one direction is significantly poorer than all other angles, which makes no sense.  It is not a good screen, and honestly, the buttons could be better as well.  For one, make a D pad instead of 4 individual buttons.  Not a huge deal, but you do notice a difference.<br /><br />I would wait until other mainstream companies start making gaming tablets, stay away from this unless you can get one for about $100.  I returned it, I won't get another one, even if it had every LCD pixel working.
B007EZJKS2|4.0|I purchased this by accident, because I thought it was the actual novel, by Peter S. Beagle.  The kindle description is not very clear and I didn't read any of the reviews which warn you of this being a comic book before I made my purchase.  With that being said, it was The Last Unicorn which I am a huge fan of...and I couldn't give it a low rating!
030758836X|4.0|I loved this book. The twists kept me coming back! If you want an interesting read, I highly recommend \\"Gone Girl.\\"
B00CFOXBX2|4.0|I watched the film on a flight from Las Vegas to Austin; a great choice. Very entertaining and the story line will keep you interested.
B000FC10MU|5.0|I have read several of Gaimans novels and this one has been my favorite so far although Anansi Boys is a close second. I love his use of allusion. I reading this work was empowering. If you enjoy Mythology, that's taken and transformed into something modern and hilarious, then consider reading this.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I'd been excited to buy The Hunger Games, and I'm so glad I chose this product! The shipping was so fast! It reached me within days of placing the order. The DVD combo was just as it had been described by the seller (so no unwanted surprises about the content/quality) I was very happy with my purchase!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This works great the way you'd hope it would. Use it - Enjoy it - Love it! Now somebody please solve the Adobe Flash issue!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game.  I always like the SIM city type of games and this one is pretty good.  Easy to play.  Easy to learn.
B000PC1JKS|5.0|Meaning 'better than imagined'. A gift, I am quoting the recipient here, &#34;I want to collect all his albums.&#34; Perfect.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I love this book!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't wait to get the next book the death cure!!!!! I loved all the action and adventure in the book!!! I like the new charters as much as the old ones!!!!  I ran out of money on my kindle so I can't get the next book yet! :( most of the time the next book is bad or not as good but the next book is amazing!!!!!!! Thomas is as stupid as in the last book and you get to see the bad side of treassa! :)

B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is the best slender game i found on the fire. The graphics are decent. The sounds excellent and slender is the scariest than with my computer with the original. I gave it four stars because its not exactly like the original but not as scary but still scary. And remember slender always watching you...jk
B00992CF6W|3.0|This Is A Good Game The Only Thing That Sucks Is I Can't Join Any Games And You Can Change Name And I Can Even Change Skin So I'm Lucky So Get This Game
B007VUA7VO|4.0|works pretty well for me! must have application in  wich helps to manage my battery life. tells me wiyh accuracy how long my is battery life.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I bought this because I loved the movie and the dvd is a great price and value ontop of being a good movie.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The story is incredible.  The music was incredible.  The singing was incredible.  The sets were incredible. My only disappointment was in some of the music.  I didn't realize it would be mostly singing.  Some of the songs I simply didn't understand the words.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|This is a very effective offering to help people understand the challenges of people who are differently abled.  I used it in one of my seminary classes.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|This is a retread of old film and TV stories with a cliche \\"terrorism\\" story grafted on top of it with the \\"shocking\\" revelation that the government is the bad guy. Really cheap looking sets don't help either. Its very fannish and almost at the level of homage. Both the TV episode and the film being riffed on had far better writing and better stories. Its less a film than a fan event or a recreation. This might be excused in the first film, But two films in and there is really no original story to speak of. By the audience reaction, lots of red meat was being thrown to the fans. But it didn't mean much to me.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch has no charisma in a part that required it. Compared to the first film, the action scenes were either derivative or unimaginative. The battle in space was the usual non-event with an uneven match up. The \\"Boiler room\\" design of the ship is really starting to get old as is hanging around earth all the time.<br /><br />The film confirms why a certain person is perfect as the first director of Disney's industral explotation of the Star Wars properties. The director is great at projecting the illusion of change while doing material that is derivative, \\"safe' and rather empty.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Great game to play when you need to unwind and clear your mind.just what a creative mind needs for creative process
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Game was typical hidden object game. No real story just location to location searches. Game was over before I knew it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|,I think it is amazing, but it just needs more to the package. . Mojang needs to add more. Johan should be able to add more than now. But it's cool.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I believe in  heaven but this book seems to be different from others. It might  be because of the authors great intelligence that he experienced this differently.  I preferred other books about the afterlife much better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The hunger games series is amazing!!! I love this book! I am probably going to read this over and over.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved it, but a bit too short.  Def worth 2 bucks.  Waiting for the next one, hope its even better!
B00CFQMVLS|3.0|Wow, this movie is about as brain dead as they come! Horrible story involves son of John McClane who is an undercover CIA agent getting rescued by Pa. Why the average review? Well the action scenes were very good in my honest opinion which balances out the weak script. Loved the ending when the Helicopter flies into the building and Bruce Willis flipping the bird! Only sad thing was that this is every bit as bad as Die Hard was good (if that makes any sense) and if this is the last one of the series, its a shame it ended so poorly.
B001AG52AG|5.0|Great movie my grand daughter loved it. It got here in great condition and on time. I was impressed, wonderful.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is interesting at every corner. It is worth the read.  Wish life connections were so easy. Please do read u will definitely enjoy it
1400064287|4.0|Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die by Chip Heath, Dan Heath<br /><br />\\"Made to Stick\\" is an interesting book on how to make ideas stick.  Taking a page from Gladwell's insightful book, \\"The Tipping Point\\" The Heath brothers, Chip and Dan identify traits that make ideas stick and others not.  Making good use of interesting research and an engaging writing style helps the main ideas of this book \\"stick\\" to you. There are few stellar examples but what's here is good. This intriguing 291-page is composed of the following sic chapters: 1. Simple, 2. Unexpected, 3. Concrete, 4. Credible, 5. Emotional, and 6. Stories.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Engaging, accessible prose on how to make ideas stick.<br />2. The authors have a great command of the topic and made it fun for the readers.<br />3. The authors identify and share the main traits that allow ideas to stick.  The use of research and interesting stories to convey their main points. The key behind how effective ideas are constructed.<br />4. The six principles behind sticky ideas: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions, and stories.  In short, the six principles can be compacted into the acronym SUCCESs. \\"The book will teach you how to transform your ideas to beat the Curse of Knowledge\\".<br />5. Solid easy to follow format which allows for ease of reference.  Each chapter covers a specific principle of sticky ideas. The authors periodically introduce \\"Idea Clinics\\" which provide practical examples of sticky ideas.<br />6. The key behind simple ideas. \\"The Commander's Intent (CI) is a crisp, plain-talk statement that appears at the top of every order, specifying the plan's goal, the desired end-state of an operation.\\"<br />7. Making it easier to learn new concepts by tying it to concepts you already know.  How schemas enable profound simplicity. \\"Analogies make it possible to understand a compact message because they invoke concepts that you already know.\\"<br />8. The art of getting attention. \\"The most basic way to get someone's attention is this: Break a pattern.\\" And just as importantly, how to keep it. \\"Unexpected ideas are more likely to stick because surprise makes us pay attention and think.\\"<br />9. The value of concrete language. \\"Concrete language helps people, especially novices understand new concepts.  Abstraction is the luxury of the expert.\\" \\"Concrete ideas are easier to remember.\\"<br />10. The power of details. \\"The use of vivid details is one way to create internal credibility - to weave sources of credibility into the idea itself.\\" The Sinatra Test.<br />11. Statistics in perspective. \\"This is the most important thing to remember about using statistics effectively. Statistics are rarely meaningful in and of themselves. Statistics will, and should, almost always be used to illustrate a relationship. It's more important for people to remember the relationship than the number.\\"<br />12. The importance of emotions with regards to decisions. \\" The mere act of calculation reduced people's charity. Once we put on our analytical hat, we react to emotional appeals differently. We hinder our ability to feel.\\"<br />13. Many great examples of effective ads.  What made them so effective.<br />14. Effective campaigns. Understanding the audience and the best methods to appeal to said audience.  The \\"Don't Mess With Texas\\" Campaign is an excellent case study.<br />15. The power of stories. \\"Stories are effective teaching tools. They show how context can mislead people to make the wrong decisions. Stories illustrate causal relationships that people hadn't recognized before and highlight unexpected, resourceful ways in which people have solved problems.\\"<br />16. One of the best examples of the book is the well-known story behind Jared and Subway.  The example showcases the SUCCESs checklist.<br />17. The three basic plots behind stories: The Challenge Plot, the Connection plot, and the Creativity plot.<br />18. The authors do a wonderful job of summarizing their key points of the book.<br />19. Easy reference guide.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. No formal bibliography.<br />2. Many good examples but few stellar ones.<br />3. Repetitive and sometimes for a reason.<br />4. With regards to math proficiency in Asia over American children, the book ignores the fact that Chinese children can memorize more numbers than Americans because their numbers are remarkably brief.  The memory gap between English and Chinese is apparently in large part due to difference in length. BTW I got this information, from the book \\"Outliers\\" by Malcolm Gladwell.<br />5. Honoring the game and Lance Armstrong should no longer be in the same sentence.  Of course, the Armstrong scandal occurred years after this book was published.<br />6. I felt the book lost its rhythm in the midway through the book and stumbled to the finished line.<br /><br />In summary, this was a fun book to read.  The Heath brothers have an engaging style that is matched by interesting research in support of their main arguments. The book is good but it's not great...there are few stellar anecdotes (such as Jared from Subway).  It also drags a bit midway.  That being said, there are great ideas on how to make ideas \\"stick\\".  3.5 Stars, recommended with some minor reservations.<br /><br />Further suggestions: \\"[[ASIN:0385528752 Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard]]\\" by the same authors, \\"[[ASIN:0316017930 Outliers: The Story of Success]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]]\\" by Malcolm Gladwell, \\"[[ASIN:1400069289 The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business]]\\" by Charles Duhigg, \\"[[ASIN:1594484805 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]]\\" by Daniel H.

B00BR0SEAK|5.0|This was a classic piece of music from Deep Purple.  The tracks were short, like in the 60's with wonderful 'riffs'.  Could have used more tracks, though.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Would be better if there were daily rewards and a chance to trade money for hearts. To upgrade past a certain lvl u need to put in your own cash, to by credits.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|pretty much diablo3 on your android. fun and addicting. respawning health pots help to keep you playing. touch screen controls work well.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|The movie was fine but it was only half the story.  Nobody said that it was a two part movie (or is this a trilogy)
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clard always keeps you in suspence and she has a way with her books that no one else seemd to have.
0062238868|5.0|Once you start reading this book, it's hard to put it down.  While we sleep in our comfortable beds and enjoy a bar-b-q out back, Chris reminds us why we are able to live the American life here at home.  People like Chris are a select few who will do anything to protect American's, and I do mean anything.  America last a great hero and a wonderful man.

076115678X|4.0|especially if you buy Deva Curl products...(if color treated hair- try the no Fade line).  there is a travel kit for $19!

B000I9U75G|3.0|Too predictable and Broderick was not a believable character.  Plot was thin and the subplots were transparently thin.  Surprised I watched the whole thing.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is really good. it starts off fairly easy. then the challenges get more difficult. great graphics and gameplay. keep up the good work&hellip;Gameloft.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This is a great show. Actors are true to form. Characters are from history (as many as can be traced). Real acting not CGI! Filmed at locations ranging from Ireland to Scandinavia and probably more in the future it make for an authentic setting to view this History Channel favorite.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It is a very good game, is perfect as the other versions, everyone needs to have this game on your tablet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down once I got past the first few chapters! The twists kept coming until the very end of the book!
B00BMQDM10|5.0|A typical Kinsella! Great page turner with loughing out loud moments. Also made me think how much we depend on our mobile devices these days.
0525953728|5.0|A short book considering all of the information and details that are out there.  The first hand insight is great.  Makes me prouder to be an American.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I got this because we have a game like this on our computer. Like it because you can play different ways.<br />Only thing I don't like is the clock running, but no big deal.<br />Would recommend to anyone who likes a challenge.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|Delivers fast performance when viewing small or large PDF files. When performance counts this is the app to go with. I have tried it will very large PDF files that I downloaded from Scribd and it has no problems. An equal to the desktop version. I would give 6 stars.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|I ordered this item 3 times to try and get one with a clip and it doesn't have one. I bought it last year and it had a clip..
B00932A4XE|3.0|All the funny moments were in the previews. This movie could have been so much better. I was disappointed but I guess it was entertaining enough as a chick flick to give it 3 stars.
B000OV85AW|5.0|My husband has this on VHS...I was worried it would either break or the VCR would finally die. This was a perfect birthday gift for him :)
B004GYY714|5.0|This is nice, now I have a radio in my Fire HD.  I can tune in to my stations on my Fire and still surf the web.  I like it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I have followed the Star Wars Saga since it was first released.  So glad to have purchased the beginning of the story.<br />If you are a sci-fi fan this is the one for you.  Great action packed story.  Fast paced and exciting.  I love it and I think you would too.
B00BR4QNJ0|1.0|Like almost every Glu game this game requires you to purchase in-game currency to get farther then about wave 20. The only problem I have with this game is that it's a typical catch and release game. There was an article in Game Informer last month that details the disturbing trend of games now a days especially tab and mobile games that require you to pay real money to complete their &quot;Free&quot; game. In my opinion no game should require you to constantly make in game purchases to complete their game. So I recommend you not downloading this game unless you have deep pockets. This game doesn't deserve a low star rating but until this game stops trying to rope in people then bend them over a barrel and force them to cough up cash to play it I shall stand by my 1 star rating.<br />Besides that it's a great game.<br />Amazing graphics.<br />Nice sounding.<br />Good story line.<br />And a great way to waste time!<br />Just not worth it unless you have deep pockets.
140131046X|5.0|Excellent book and a great value.  Albom is a great writer.  I would suggest this book to almost anyone.  It has been said it is, &#34;A faith journey that could be become a classic.&#34;
