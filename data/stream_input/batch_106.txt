B00FZE2U72|5|Looks great. Arrived in time and stuck to car easily. Would recommend anytime.
B00SRW9DVA|5|Cheap and effective.  should have bought more
B008BR7A1G|5|I just installed it in my 2008 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS. It was an exact match, even the serial numbers matched. Installing it wasn't too hard, but u have to go in from the tire well. Pop the plastic rivets pull back the plastic. 3 or 4 screws and a wire harness for the bulb. Someone posted all had to do was turn the silver bezel, but the screws are on the other side. Turn your wheel or take your tire off to get at it.
B005Y14Q96|2|This did not shoot well.  I had to purchase another product.
B006K8V5M8|5|Other Items Pictured: Bolts on Power Rings - [[ASIN:B00AA3HUNW Stainless Steel Socket Cap Bolt M8 x (1.25mm) x 25mm]]  Power Rings - [[ASIN:B001DL27NS StreetWires PRI4 4 AWG Inter-Lok Power Ring Pair]]  I bought same/similar product years ago. At that time it was an Esoteric Audio-stamped product. I loved it then and now, even if it is a commodity design sold under different names and through various outlets. Of particular note is that these are rugged and the gold plating has not flaked even where I have applied tons of torque. Regarding torque, I have heat-treated allen wrenches with extremely tight tolerances, and have practically jumped up and down on the ring screws and the clamp screws to tighten them, and... well, these are just indestructible! On the other hand, they are quite difficult to work with if you need to expand them for any reason. I installed them on an Optima Yellowtop (Group 35) and have StreetWires Inter-Lok 4 AWG Power Rings and Blue and Gray positive and negative 4 AWG power cable for vehicle and audio system power duties. It looks nice and clean.  No, the edges are not as rounded as the photo suggests, but neither are they sharp or crude or burred. They are chamfered ever-so-slightly which, in my opinion, retains the rugged appearance of sharp angles combined with the common sense application of exacting finishing. They are excellent and, at this price, a steal.
B0083H4SMI|5|Corrected the mirror not moving. Delivered as posted
B0002JN2EU|2|put it in my gas tank when there was maybe 4 gallons left. Then ran it until it hit empty and filled it up.  Didn't really do anything noticeable.<br />Might grab another bottle to run through my oil system.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Excelent
B012XIP074|5|I installed these in the center high mount stop lamp and licence plate lights on my 05 Town and Country. I wouldn't say they're any brighter than incandescent bulbs. They do produce a nice clean white light and that's important. I'm also hoping they last longer. It's only ba couple weeks but I'm happy with them so far.
B001QV9XW8|5|They worked great.  Just need to have the front end checked and adjusted now.
B00ONH1TE2|4|It fit my Ford Mustang well. I did have to buy the gaskets separate, though. A real bargain compared to what the dealer was asking.
B005617OJI|5|Love it!  My husband and I love to ride.  With the old rack, I would stare into the rearview mirror ready for a bike to fall off.  With this one, I feel so much more secure.  We've had up to three bikes on it and no mishaps--even with going over bumps.
B00K9YZO4O|5|Driving a Jeep Wrangler 2001 and this was the best fit and reliable cat that wasnt from the dealer
B008652VLM|4|I like to put it several places and I think it pretty well gets the point out.
B00T5G53ZM|1|Completely worthless. Thankfully not costly enough to constitute a total disaster. Not discoverable with my Android Samsung Note 8 tablet at all. Tried it in my 2002 Dodge Neon and my !995 Ford Ranger. Gave it to the Salvation Army.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Just completed 2400 mile cross country trip from Philadelphia to Scottsdale. Keeper was amazing! No issues. Never touched it once. Multiple rain storms no leaks at all. 36 hours of driving up to 85mph including mountains and desert. Washed the bugs off with a hose and rolled it back up. Was filled to capacity on top a of Nissan Armada. I would highly recommend this product. Doesn't come with locking system so I zip tied the zipper ends together. If someone wants in bad enough they wouldn't be stopped by a lock anyway.
B000H81BUS|5|Nice Plate... It looks great on my vehicle..
B001Y93RKQ|2|They seemed fine until I put them on my 2008 Yaris. Then 2 of them cracked next to and around the valve stems. I fixed the wheel covers with epoxy and Fiverglas, but this is seeming to become a new full time career.
B00KTJ4N9Q|5|Bought this for a 1999 Chevy Venture and it works amazingly! It programmed easily and has made a great difference! I was happy with not only the quick delivery, but the sheer fact I didn't have to pay 35 each for new fobs is also amazing! .<br /><br />Both fob's came with batteries and they are going strong!
B0051OOQMI|5|The fit and look is perfect!
B009OBVRY4|2|I returned it. I had been using a 3/8 inch drill motor with a wool bonnet and assumed this would be similar. But it seems to be geared down so that it turns much slower than the drill motor. If I have a variable speed drill, I should be able to set my buffing speed--but not with this. It worked more like an applicator--which I can do with a hand held sponge. My old direct drive wool bonnet buffed a 1958 aluminum boat to a chrome like finish--after a lot of work of course, but I would still be working on it with this slow-motion machine.
B00MB8XT8E|1|Ordered two of these lights.  First day one completely quit working and a replacement was sent. Day two four LEDs went out on the second. Poor quality. I'm returning
B009HYO88K|5|Perfect
B007ZPLSL8|5|Nicely made and quick shipping
B00P2DB1EO|5|Perfect OEM fit and seem accurately labeled as a bit brighter than OEM bulbs were.. they are the same color, not those daylight-white or blueish tinted ones.
B00FR2JF0W|5|I've used it several times...does what's it's supposed to...the instructions are useless...I just wired it to my battery and hide the wire under my seat..it goes into my saddlebag...only charges while bike is running but other bikes might be different
B00AK91JCO|3|They look sleek, but they interfere with the operation of the window. Can no longer use the auto-up feature. Also, the drivers side one, the window struck the part along the aft side and broke a chunk off.
B00NFSNAS8|4|Seems to work well. The only thing is that when I opened it,  the glass lens that covers the gauge was lying in the bag. I had a hard time getting it on. Hope it stays on. Sometimes its hard disconnecting the hose from the tire valve without losing to much air. Just received it so I will give it more time.
B000A09MFE|5|Fit my 2010 Mazda CX7 2.3l turbo. Not much to say other than that ...its just a filter
B00EF3SAJQ|5|It was exactly as shwn and it helps to get my kayak where I need to take it.
B00BCRMB34|3|Kinda difficult to install
B00OBA5FYQ|5|Works perfect keeps water out
B0002JMIEK|5|This is the best car polish I have ever use.I was about to order some more,and notice the price went up.(Liquid Glass)
B00PYZ00RY|5|In time.
B005T6VA86|4|works great and has definitely made people aware of me coming. I have had several people tell me they can see me from a long ways away. WELL WORTH it
B000BUQOFO|5|works just fine
B000TYJY72|5|Very nice addition to my Star 950 ! Good quality!
B0002X520S|5|Awesome stuff.
B00ANZHG7C|5|Great product.
B00BFM5NSG|5|When I called the dealer they wanted $400 to purchase this with installation.  I was surprised that Nissan did not include this as standard equipment.  Apparently,  the Japanese do not consider center armrests important.  I recently had a Mazda CX-5 that was an excellent vehicle, but with a half-baked center armrest that sat too low to be functional.<br />Nissan did do a good job designing this one.  Excellent quality that sits at the right height.  I was prepared for a small installation project but was surprised that it fit tightly enough in the back cubbyhole for forgo this.  They offer many generic versions of this armrest on eBay that are cheaper, but I doubt if they match the quality of this one.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Easiest thing to use. It has great coverage and it just plain works! Great customer service. Definitely a product I would recommend to my friends and family
B00S82LICQ|5|Switch and harness worked great!!!
B00Q8FUAO2|4|My truck sounds much better.  Seem to notice a bit more power as well.  The fitment could be a little better but I made it work!
B00REJXAZC|5|looks good easy install well worth the money
B000C7VUSW|5|Fit great on my 2001 Dodge Dakota.
B000EQ2O9U|4|Installed and worked if this thing lasts reasonable time frame will come back and give it a five.<br />Everything included to make the install. I did reuse the original gasket for tank to pump as the included one was really thick probably would have worked but that's what I chose to do.
B0001EFSTI|5|Great size to carry on your key ring - bought this for my husband who travels.  Will be buying more as gifts.
B000VXBGV8|5|Fits great. Smells great. Works well.
B002935IV2|4|Protected the finish on the roof.
B005M3ITAI|5|great item
B00PDENHWQ|2|Fits loose. At first a pin wouldn't even fit in it, had to drill it out bigger. Not great but it will do the job
B000C9WLEW|5|Good right parts
B004ME11FS|4|No worries from this product- just remember you probably need a pressure regulator that does not come with this hose.
B00IR90FG0|5|look great on my truck  thank you
B00ZECEDBQ|5|It's exactly what they advertise true CREE LED I seal the unit myself using windshield seal it just in case
B006YBBSWI|5|Love this.  Fit my 2012 Toyota Prius V 3!  My first complete set I bought.  Deluxe look with the rugged built.  Better than any other so call custom all-weather floor mats!
B000YAYLZ6|4|Fits to size. Good quality material and tough enough to last a couple of years. However it didn't keep out all the rain as some water seeped throught0 the center zip. Nevertheless keeps warm and protect against the elements
B00OKJ4WRY|5|Arrived on time, fit perfectly, about a 1.5 hour job on our odyssey.  Starter was new as far as I could tell, but price was more in line with rebuilt models.  Says made in china, and no stickers indicating re-manufactured.  Happy with outcome.
B00CG5RYEW|5|great product PLEASE LOOK UP SELLER FIRST!!!!!, there are many and some have great reviews and some don't...item is just as it appears
B00077WG2G|2|Did not cover entire trunk area.
B000CF5ZF8|5|Great price on high quality product. Seem to be equal to and possibly better than OEM parts. Longevity is the key, will they last as long as a pair of VW wipers? We shall see. Expect update when they are in need of replacement...
B00BTGSGFK|3|2-3 washes and they start to open up at the seams. They are great while they last.
B00CCIM1YQ|5|I use this for locking my moped up at work and for quick errands. I've had it for a couple months and am very happy so far. The weight doesn't bother me, as it is under my seat when I'm riding. I think it is high quality and works for these relatively safe areas. I probably wouldn't use this as my sole protection overnight in a high crime area, but for basic security, I think it is great. The long reach is great for locking the wheel to a bike rack or solid post and keeps me from having to maneuver a chain near hot parts. Overall, I am happy.
B001H1O688|5|Had mine for over four years without any problems. Great item highly recommend.<br />My vehicle: 2009 Ford F150 4.6L 3V 6spd Pickup.  Best $20 you'll ever spend.
B00MB0E21U|4|UPDATE: This pink cover lasted almost to the month 2 years! Bought it in August 2015, Its Sep 2017. The black starting falling apart, pulling away from the pink material. I WILL buy another one, the exact one, because I loved the feel of it so much, but be aware it lasts for 2 years and I was pretty careful with it.<br /><br />Old Review:<br />This to me was pretty easy to get on, You do have to do some pulling and tugging but I had it on beautifully within 3 minutes. I love how it feels, it has that memory foam material. You deff do not want to have dirty hands. Keep it clean. I took 2 pics to show how it looked in my Nissan Frontier truck, the one pic I tried to get close up so you see how it fits on the steering wheel. This is deff worth buying!!! Oh and my steering wheel measured about a 15 and a little over that. This is a 16 and it fit perfectly.
B00684TAYY|4|Great fob for about a week. The instructions that came with it were spot on and was quick and easy to set up for my vehicle and then the battery went dead in the remote. Thought it was odd that the fob was brand new and battery didn't last a week. Replaced the battery which was half the coat of the remote purchased and all is good. 4 star rating just because of the battery issue.
B000RLPNLI|5|works well
B005NLQAHS|4|combined with the &#34;Torque&#34; app on Android phone this is really cool.
B0002SR4Q8|5|Nice tool to use.  No problems at all!
B001KZFENC|1|Did work very well already need replaced after 4 months
B00JSDZQDQ|5|My first time ever doing work like this.<br />It was a cinch putting the light in. It lights the raid beautifully amd is clear.<br />Beware though make sure the lights are screwed in tight! Lest they fall out and catch fire on cords. Just I speak from experience lol.<br />Just make sure it's all in tight.<br />Bulbs all worked.<br />Thanks azon!
B000BZI4JI|5|THESE SENSORS ARE GREAT!
B0076AKISQ|5|Works great
B00KB5G0EO|3|They are ok, wish the pads were thicker a little too thin
B00BCRMBGQ|1|Horrible. Very cheap material. Only good thing that came out of this set was the steering wheel.
B00LOO380K|5|Perfect fit 2015 Golf Sportwagen MK7. Nice durable mats. Easy to take in and out. Easy to clean.  Hooks to stock floor mat mounts well.  I could see the weather tech brand covering more area around the edges. I like the way these look more.
B008FCE7ZO|5|It's just what I needed. Super easy to install and very practical. Love it!
B000QDHENM|5|Great for the price
B001LHVOVK|5|Works great!! no problem it is easy to use has code chart with it and cancels code warning thanks!!
B00GMQ1MTY|5|product works great
B00LXVSCXM|3|Doesn't fit most cars I've tried it on, cool concept, wished they had more sizes
B002QGVW3K|5|A high quality, low price product.
B005DLLVWC|5|Just what I needed. Works great.
B0002F67ZK|5|Easy to install and works great.  Water heats fast and we have plenty of hot water even having a family of 4 showering in our camper
B00R3LYF7S|5|Its great for the truck. I love how it help keep everything in one place.
B000NPUJQC|2|Not the best, but what you would expect without spending big bucks.  The clips tend to come off at times and sockets are difficult to get on and off them.  Sharp edges on ends can and will cut you while placing clips on the slides.  Wear gloves.
B00ANZHG4U|5|I love these rags! I use it for everything!
B00P6ZI0DI|5|Just as described. I replaced the hinges on my ford escape in less than 20 minutes. Fits perfectly. Only thing is you have to tape/hold the glass in place when replacing these. Fast delivery as well!
B00B1VBQRS|5|My truck drives and runs like new and I intend to use this stuff to help keep it that way. I use a fuel system cleaner each time I change my oil (about every 5K miles) just as a preventative measure and for my last 4 vehicles, I've yet to have an fuel system related issue. To that end, I can't say that this product fixed an issue for me - I try to &#34;prevent&#34; any (expensive) issues before they occur. So far, so good! Royal Purple seems to have excellent quality products.
B00UJ5YL6U|3|Very bright... the adjusting screws are awful to deal with.  I mounted two next to each other and found that it was nearly impossible to get to them to adjust.
B000KYT2QY|5|The ad said it was used but in &#34;good&#34; condition&#34; heck this thing is in new condition! Works perfect, couldnt be happier.
B000B8U61O|5|Perfect match, even the holes lined up with existing holes. Please note: vent didn't come with screws and I needed to repaint my old ones to make fresh. I also painted this vent with plastic chair paint before installation with the hopes it will stay white longer. This vent is bright white but my other older vent yellowed over time.
B00EKEGRVS|5|BOY DID THIS COME IN HANDY THIS SUMMER
B00062YVWU|3|Was missing one of the adapters. Otherwise works fine.
B005PYIT0Y|5|Thank you for the headlight it saved my day! Good quality for the price and great customer service would definately buy something again.
B000GZKN42|5|Excellent product. Sounds great on my Blackbird. Fit and finish are great as well.
B00S4HFNXK|5|Who would even think that a major improvement could be made to something as simple as a boat fender.  I like the Extreme Max BoatTector better than the standard boat fender because it takes up less room when it's inside the boat and it protects the top of the gunnel from damage from the dock.
B007EEVKZE|4|Carburetor worked fine but I had to do some minor modifications and purchase a new sponge air filter. I have a 1984 Honda XL80  that is original and bone stock. The carburetor that I received was smaller in size and so was the air intake side. Here is what I had to do to get carb to work, change top throttle cable cap from existing old carb (same diameter cap but slides are different size), if you note in picture the location where throttle cable goes is straight, mine has a bend in it so throttle cable will clear gas tank. The air intake side of carb is much smaller in size then original stock carb so stock air cleaner attachment is too large in diameter, also the distance of new carb to air cleaner attachment is about 3/4&#34; less in reach. So to keep it simple I bought an after market sponge filter for now, it does detract a little from the stock look.  Thanks, I will attach some pictures. Product did come fast and without issue
B009OT0Z30|5|The facets fit perfectly. They even looked better than the ones we replaced.
B00L5KJQCC|4|Works great, not the best but it is more then serviceable.
B00A9WOS7A|5|It fit perfectly, thank you:)
B000YCAMNY|5|one side on passenger front is out from side but other wise love them
B00DHQC5Q6|5|It really works
B007TN520Y|5|Love this stuff!  Removes oil grease and especially paint very well.
B004ROPQ2C|4|Look great, Seals had issues with coming off during unscrewing.
8093000658|5|Nice bulbs much brighter then OEM . There is no substitute for keeping you and your family safe.
B00TUJWGG8|5|Very good for my 2007 m35<br />Thanks
B002QAC66I|5|Great product, quality, very satisfied.
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Excellent product, fits my 2014 Tacoma quite well. The only ding I give it is that the storage cover could be larger. It's a bit cumbersome to get it back in there and when you're out making multiple stops in a day, a larger cover would be that much more convenient.<br /><br />Beyond that, it's a good product and I would buy again.
B00GIXF9ZE|5|Excellent
B004I0PP4Y|5|Easy to install and way cheaper then going to the mechanic/body shop.
B00V39FLOW|1|Well, this was a waste of money.  Shipped with no instructions, only a sticker on the packing telling me to go to their home page where they have links to youtube install videos.  The youtube video shows a template is taped onto the factory grille and then a drill is used in strategic areas to remove the emblem, then the billet bowtie is secured in place with two sided tape.  No template was included in the packing and I haven't found it on their website.  If I were to follow the video instructions I'd have to remove my winch bumper/grill guard due to clearance issues getting a drill in there.  Not happening.<br /><br />Maybe I took the product photo too literal, thinking I could swap out the whole emblem assembly (it sits recessed into the grille), I don't know.  I do know that I won't be drilling into a brand new truck and will look around for a different bowtie solution.
B000CNC6A2|5|Fel pro never disappoints
B003VLBPJA|1|cheap, wont securely attach anything really
B00GFI2XYM|5|Good choice
B000NZPK1G|4|Pros:<br />The pinch plates snap into the buckle very nicely without any force and also eject from the buckle via small springs once the lever is turned. The pinch plates also move from side to side a fair bit allowing for greater adjustment compared with some other buckle designs.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The chroming on one of my harnesses pinch plates is very thin to the point where you can see the copper base plating showing through the thin chrome. Not a huge problem but it doesn't look great on a new harness. The cam-lock buckle does not weigh 165g as advertised, maybe the housing alone does but certainly not the whole buckle! The stitching is not great in places but i'm assuming would be safe and as some other reviews have stated Amazon still seems to be selling harness that have short SFI dates. My two harnesses run out in two months!<br /><br />Overall i would recommend these harnesses. The cam-lock buckle works very well with great harness adjustment the quality is generally good (the chroming on my second harness is fine) and the price is also nice. It's a shame Amazon is still selling sets with short SFI dates.
B004LQISC6|4|This was a perfect match, just like everyone else says wish it wasn't made of plastic.  No problems installing quick & easy.
B00JVWDWPS|5|Works great. Living in AZ the sun in brutal here in the summer.  I have a soft top and my plan was to install this top under my factory soft top with insulation (comforter) between.  It worked great and really keeps the heat from the top radiating down on you.  Can't even tell the insullaton is even there.
B000O3U2UQ|5|item sent to someone else. was very happy to find this at a good price. they have a battery light that won't go out on their S10. load tester will settle question of is battery okay or not.
B00RZPIT92|5|Great gloves for the price. They don't compare to the $30 gloves you can buy but they are nice for the price.
B00EFDW39Y|5|Great product!  Fit is perfect and works better than the oem struts ever did. Price was nearly half of oem price
B00S4PL3UY|5|A very good item to purchase for vehicle drying.
B00DJBQ1SW|5|look great, haven't used yet.
B00TPKKS3A|1|Not worth a damn. Starter turns way too slow. Slower than the old original starter that the bendix finally froze up on. Save your money and buy the $130 upgrade motor replacement. Cheap china crap probably doesn't have enough windings in motor. Not worth sending back. When this one dies I'll get the upgrade.
B001PJS4LW|1|BEWARE.... This is the strap ONLY.  The picture is completely deceiving.  The picture needs to be changed and the description should say 'STRAP ONLY'  Very dissatisfied.
B000MS1SO2|5|Excellent!!!!!!!!
B000JFHNEC|5|work good
B00B3BKM1M|5|True
B0000AYBTO|1|I was excited about this item. It was going to free up much needed space in my cabinet. Then I get it and my paper plates won't fit. There too big they hold a smaller than the normal paper plate.
B00574TAXC|5|Exact length as indicated, installed easily, and works as advertised.<br /><br />I used this to connect a powered AM/FM antenna on a Ranger UTV to connect to the head unit.
B00U0NRPD2|5|Fast shipping....love this battery!
B000CITK8S|5|Works great can't beat the price
B00809X2EY|5|as described nothing more to say it's a filter and seems of good QT would buy again.
B002XLHUQG|4|I noticed a difference the moment I walked into my trailer.  Much less rocking.  I still us the stabilizers that are installed in the trailer, as well as using standard tire chocks.  I've read where some people just use the X-Chocks.
B005MZUQA2|5|nice magnet flag, just remember this is large.  Measure where you want to put it.  Nice final finish - strong magnetic  pull.  semi - flexible to wrap around minor curves.
B00AAHTTDC|3|These did not fit my E39 headlight sockets very well. In stock form, they did not do a good job of locking the H7 HID bulbs into the sockets. They allowed too much movement of the bulbs, which in turn permitted one of my bulb's return wires to get bent during installation. I was able to get them to seat better by injecting a liberal amount of silicone in through the rear of the adapter, which held the bulb in place better. The adapters now fit very snug, so much so that it is difficult to now remove them, but I would rather have that over a loose fitting. The silicone should also keep moisture out of the headlight lens, which was a concern of mine.
B00KJ8PP58|4|UPDATE: After 2 months, I had my first issue.  When getting out of the car, my wife accidentally moved the turn signal stalk down, turning on the left side &#34;coming home&#34; lights.  They did not turn off with a timer and stayed on all night long.  We awoke to a dead battery.  The light sensor that makes this switch automatic is not adjustable.  We have noticed that at twilight, the lights will turn on and off as we pass under trees and between buildings.  This product would be better if there was a timer to delay the switching off of the lights to prevent the on-off-on-off-on behavior.  When this happened the last time, I know the person in front of us thought we were crazy, turning our lights on and off!  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Just received this today. Purchased from Amazon on August 1, 2015 and received on August 13.  This is for a 2012 VW Tiguan S. Installation involved removing the dash end panel and the &#34;A&#34; Pillar cover.  Then I pulled the original headlight switch out of the dash, disconnected it and routed the sensor to the corner of the dashboard through the access created by removing the end panel.  I tested the switch and all functions work as intended. This is a bargain and I couldn't be more pleased on day 1.
B000CIRA3A|5|Once the correct part was received as promised it was a great transaction
B000N5U5VG|5|A++++++ worth every penny
B00GONRC44|5|Makes night driving a breeze! Especially with a tinted windshield! Like nothing is there. Not had a single problem yet!
B0081SQY1W|5|Protects my placard from the hot sun in the windshield.
B002MQDY4O|5|perfect  fit !
B00GBVHPV4|4|Xl did not fit me runs small, but they did fit my buddy he likes them. I will update if they break.
B0009OR8V6|5|very good tool for the shop especially when working by yourself
B009GOV4O2|5|exactly what I ordered and needed.
B0060A83IK|4|Okay, so a wild turkey flew into my wife's 2005 Ford Freestyle and busted the mirror so I decided to fix it myself. Easy to install, good quality, and probably saved me a bunch of money compared to taking it somewhere to get fixed.
B008M1WB7E|5|Fit perfect, light and durable.
B004IJILFA|5|Good quality filter. My husband replaced it in minutes without a problem. Bought for a Suzuki Sx4 2008.
B0076PXV4Y|5|Very good!
B0048F61AQ|5|I was pretty sure that these were going to be too dark. The picture with the 4 piece mat needs to be replaced. These rugs are perfect size and perfect color. Score!!!!!
B000E3EWNE|5|2 years and it still in perfect condition. Good quality!
B004ZF4MW8|5|I recently install the same HID in another car Aug 8 2015 for a friends. It looks great and you can really notice the power, distance and clarity. very fast to install and takes up no time. the shipping was awesome, very fast and way before the estimated deliver date.  it very well design and doesn't take up space. However the one i order for my use didn't work. one light bulb didn't work. the return was fast and ill just get a replacement when i have the time.
B0033DOKX4|5|just right
B00496RE82|4|Great price.  My father in law was in need and this fit the bill and did what it needed to do.
B001ABMM3G|5|fitted my 2010 FJ
B00OYEBRRS|5|It fit petfect
B00AQ29FOY|1|Cheap
B007TYFFTG|5|Highly recommend them. Quick delivery, with Prime.<br />It was a perfect fit for our Sebring.
B00OBGQUVM|3|I just need to learn to put them on, great idea though.
B00SH1SN6C|5|very good
B003SSGVBI|5|Great!!!!
B0058FETMM|5|Worked great on my 1980 CB125S! Love the look.  One issue though, the bar end mirrors were hard to get installed.  The swell fitting is almost to hard of an alloy to be able to tighten it in the bar, I had to swell it and tap it it with a mallet to get it installed.
B00D8Y6ZWM|5|Griot's products are the BEST.
B004B5W9VS|5|Installed a Ford 8.8 on the rear of my YJ and a Dana 44 on the front. This makes it so the whole set is 5x5.5 and now the rear is just an inch narrower than the front. Good Quality.
B007V2EF2Y|5|My 2007 Prius would get so hot that I dreaded getting in after it's been sitting in the sun. This shade is big enough to cover the whole window on my Prius and cool it down significantly. Now just need to tint the car to cool it even more. The product itself is rather cumbersome but works great
B005OS5DHI|4|These connectors made rewiring my CB550 a breeze.  A little more compact would have been nice for a bike, but these look clean and professional.<br /><br />Only complaint: I purchased these and more genuine Weatherpack connectors from another vendor and I'm not sure which is at fault, but the 3-pin male and female connectors were not compatible between the two.  There are tiny alignment slots in the bores so you can't hook these up backwards, and they were on opposite sides of the connector from one brand to another.<br /><br />The rest of the kit and all pieces included were perfect!  I'm glad they labeled the bags of terminals and seals, the other vendor did not.
B00B5A7C9Q|5|Good product! Very good quality
B00WVVIHCY|1|Bought these for my 06 HHR along with the resistors and WOW am i amazed. If you own an HHR you how much of a pain in the but it is to change any light up front. It was pretty difficult to install the resistors with the limited space (even with the tires off) but with an extra set of hands it wasnt too bad. Took 2 hours from start to clean up and i LOVE THEM! Extremely brighter than stock and they disperse light just like the hologen bulbs and for only $25 with reaistors its a great deal. Way cheaper than superbrightled amd of the same quality.  UPDATE 6/21/16 So both bulbs have already gone out within only 8 months. My incandesents lasted longer. These are obviously made poorly with little to no QA. For the price it is understandable. Cheap is cheap. They did replace one but it took 3 weeks to get which is a long time to go without a front turn signal. Im done with jdm.
B004L5WLZ2|5|Very awesome product for any black vehicle, Achieved a mirror finish. I recommend the entire black paint kit sold by chemical guys
B000BOAX1G|5|Excellent item
B005BNYY26|5|We broke our vent cleaning the roof and got this as a replacement. It looks and works great. This lid doesn't let to much light in but you can still see out pretty clearly. No leaks and we haven't managed to break it yet. Even though our other vent lid hasn't broken yet I'm seriously thinking about just buying another one of these and replacing it anyway. Really easy to install, just need some pliers to bend the hing to lock it on and your done.
B001G7O7VY|5|Did the job and was available even though the local Honda service department said that they did not sell these brush assemblies - you had to buy the entire alternator!  Major cost savings with this part for the DIYer.
B00651CIL2|5|I just bought a used 2014 F-150 and the radio antenna looked like it had been in a fight and lost. I think that the antenna had been replaced, but I decided to give my truck a new look. I saw this 14 inch radio antenna and really like it. Looks good on the truck and gives it a sporty look. My truck is silver so I am doing some face lifts in black color. This slim and black antenna fits right in on my plans for sporty up this truck. So far the reception has not deteriorated. I pickup the same radio stations and some are far away, but still works OK.<br /><br />Update: I have uploaded some photos to let everyone know what this 14 inch antenna looks like on my F-150.
B00I971KD2|5|Great sticker! Very satisfied! Fast shipping!
B0054WI7CW|5|What a wonderful little tool.<br />The magnet is strong.<br />The shaft is perfectly flexible.<br />First time I have changed the oil without getting oil all over my fingers.<br />I loved that I was able to let it hang over the pan and let the oil drain off the plug.<br />Very pleased, highly recommend.
B00ASY7HI6|4|They look great on my 2015 jeep rubicon and they fit perfect I just wish they snapped in like the factory ones. But they are thick and look good:)
B0025UGOVW|5|this grease gun is awesome at a great price. I bought it to work on my bike but since I got it I've greased everything i had around me
B00B3WDLTG|5|Fit my R56 S perfectly!
B001EAQTRI|2|Downgrades the music quality far too badly. Obviously, this was purchased to increase sound quality by reducing feedback and hiss, but overall it just makes the music sound tinny and weak. Not satisfied at all.
B001V6I9RS|5|Was shipped very fast and my husband loved it!
B00374XFHQ|1|came dirty as if already used.  disgusted. unacceptable when NEW item is ordered.
B007CDYX7Y|5|Great filters at a great price!
B00B7P8RS4|5|Item came pretty fast!!took out box installed less than 5 minutes.
B00SISD6TI|5|This is a great product that fits perfectly on the bumper bar of my Jeep LJ. I was a little skeptical but once I got them on and fired up they put my regular heads lights to shame. In fact, I could not see my hi-beams with the light bar on! The only problem...they made my normal heads lights looks so bad I had to replace them also.
B006R2RZOY|3|They flicker sometimes.
B00GLXHM6K|5|These are great and now quite as heavy as the other ones
B000CSW7S8|5|The Maxie runs so much smoother now.
B00BOVDCPE|4|I've been using this ez-pass holder for about 2 years. It certainly holds the i-pass very well, but removing from the holder isn't easy. It's better to just leave the i-pass in the holder if it's necessary to move it to another vehicle.<br /><br />After about a year the suction cups would become detached if the car was parked in the sun on a hot day, not suprising. It would be nice if an extra set of suction cups came with the holder. Regardless of that small issue I like using the holder better than using the adhesive backed strips that came with the i-pass.
B00MG5JB3Y|1|Torsion keys were not ever a close fit very aggravating and frustrating. I do not recommend this product.
B006C1NTEU|5|Fits perfect and was just what I needed for my car
B009DJWBK6|4|Definitely a great replacement. Looks exactly the same, but it was quite snug on my Frontier. Anticipate a lot of pushing and pulling to make it fit exactly, but better tight than loose, right? No predrilled holes for fender flares, and this plastic was a little thicker than my original bumper, so all the clips won't fit. It is just the bumper, no screws, securing roads, fog light caps, or chrome colored plastic that goes along the front. Prepared yourself to get little creative to get it on, but all in all, it's the cheapest replacement I found on here and it fit.
B00480N0SC|5|light looks amazing on truck!!! thank you :)
B004MSZC6S|1|They are blinking randomly...
B003V57NUQ|4|Nice item @ fair price and fast delivery.
B007ISYE2W|5|Great deep note and great rumble. Best price online!
B007KPUXVY|4|Needed a replacement after scratching a lens. Good quality plastic smoked lens.
B003CK75LC|4|It works after  fashion.  It sealed my tube, so I am happy.  The stuff dries out very quickly, so it is a one shot, use it, throw it away.  They give you plenty of patches, but you must use them pretty much the same day or at least fairly quickly.  At least that was my experience.
B00D7AJT2A|5|Thanks
B00LNCU3LU|5|Great product. Good quality for the price.
B005DVIUAI|4|Great Fit!
B004GE7BSU|5|For the price I'm impressed, definitely not factory quality but it works
B00V5Q74YI|1|this item failed to function properly according to my technician who let me ride with him and watch his computer readings.<br />To return the item would have been more trouble than the item was worth.
B000C59XGU|4|I have yet to really do any serious driving with these. Just finished installing, which is why I'm posting.  Sway Bar #1 - After being totally baffled I found & followed another reviewer's suggestion: used some vice grips to hold the top stud while tightening the nut with a open-end wrench. Not the greatest IMO, but it worked.  Sway bar #2 - On a lark, decided to USE THE TOP NUT FROM THE ORIGINAL HARDWARE. Oh man, so much easier. It has a self-contained & free-moving washer that somehow allows you to keep the appropriate tension on the stud while simultaneously tightening the nut.  I literally went back and replaced the nut on Sway Bar #1 with the original hardware.  (Hey, Moog, how about you spend a few cents and add the stupid washer/nut combo - or at least recommend that to the customer?)<br /><br />If you do this, be careful during removal not to pound to hard on the top stud such that you don't bend or &#34;flange&#34; it.  If you have to, remove the original nut/washer combo and use the Moog nut as a &#34;head&#34; to pound the stud out.  Again, proceed with caution.<br /><br />Instructions on the hardware package indicate to lube after install.  I did so, but the bearing/joint already looked well lubricated before adding the dust cover.
B00LG07MZE|5|Great product!  Quickly unfolds for use & quickly folds for storage.  Provides complete windshield coverage.
B0080HJL7S|5|I bought this bag for my friend whom is a taxi driver.  He was driving a customer and was stuck on a busy fast moving roadway where there was no place to pull over, and he said it saved their mats and upholstery recently as they had a intoxicated customer that had threw up in the bag instead of the car.  Now I know this bag is not intended for this use, nor did I buy it for him for this purpose but it’s nice to know that he found benefit in this. - item received as part of promo for review
B001JT1IPM|4|Great Thank you
B0009J4FHQ|5|perfect fit
B00J62PHCY|5|Easy to install, great product for the price!
B004XG2FEQ|5|Exact fit for my Chrysler 200! It was a pain in the neck literally trying to get the carriage bolts into place. But once installed it was perfect. We towed a 4x8' trailer across country with this and didn't experience a single problem!
B00S7545ZQ|5|Good one for old car without TPMS, or you want more details information for your tires. Easy to install( I get a new tire from discount tire and they install the sensor for me for free, settings are very easy)
B003CKFKI2|5|Fits on the handle bars of my Polaris 850xp touring and the front rack of my grizzly.
B00UCIOW4A|5|Perfect:)
B00AAIRII4|5|met expectations, delivery was a little slow (little over a week through USPS)
B00K5A8WNM|1|Hubcap did not come with the &#34;spring ring&#34; that is needed to snap the hubcap in place.  Without it, the hubcap just falls off your wheel.  I wish I had just gone to a local automotive store to begin with as the hubcap costs me $7 to send back.
B00HWUY7W8|5|Good quality image. I am a repeat customer!
B00IZNZOYQ|3|Tool works great but I had a really tight filter I had to put a breaker bar on and the 3/8 drive twisted in the socket. Use a big socket on it. Not the 3/8 drive part.
B00EPA7CZC|4|Not as bright as I had hoped, but they got the job done at a good price.
B00MST15KA|5|Nice item.  Good seller.
B00VHQF0TC|5|Good sunshade.
B003L7T57S|5|Absolutely, without a doubt, the perfect cure for a vehicle that isn't driven very much.  I gave my 91 Suburban - with a 7.4 liter (454) the &#34;treatment&#34; down the throttle body injectors.  Kept switching back and forth (2 injectors on mine&#34;) until the can was empty.  Let it sit about 20 minutes, and regaled the neighborhood in clouds of smoke and burning rubber.  I can't believe how well this stuff worked.  Years ago, GM carried a Delco product called &#34;Q66 carbon eliminator&#34;.  This is the equivalent, but I believe it works better.  The throttle response on my Sub is absolutely amazing after the &#34;treatment&#34;.  Just make sure your engine's hot, and let it rest after you've fed it this cocktail.  Can't say enough good things about this product!<br />PS - I'd recommend changing the oil after the treatment; God know how much carbon/schmutz is released into it.  Did I say I like this product?  Yep, thought so.
B002LKT5HQ|5|AAA
B002NEUOGG|5|Good quality product.
B00Y5LODUS|4|As advertised, came with one small scratch on the front.

B00027H33S|2|They keep moving up the pivot pin
B000CQOIVO|5|Worked well. good price!!
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Product is just as described. Nice design I may even order a few more.
B0055DVH1S|1|The mounting shaft is almost to short it needs to be at least 1/2 inch longer
B0009XQUKC|5|using it and works good
B0037YN846|5|They look awesome. Not the best grip though.
B0043063JU|5|Love this rug! We use it outside of our RV.  It's heavy duty and it's comfortable enough to walk barefoot on it. My dogs love laying on it and they don't get dirty.  Love it!
B0024GU1U2|5|Very satisfied. I feel it is worth the price. The storage bag is a bonus!
B00YXTZOY6|4|arrived as stated and appears to be what was described on facebook.
B000BYD6EM|5|Very good an nice price
B00V6WWM1G|5|GREAT PRICE GREAT PRODUCT WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT
B00D9C2CDO|5|Yes, it was waterproof, and it lasted the total 600 mile drive that we took, and didn't even scratch. It's also very easy to install.
B00HH8KLMA|2|Items came in a good amount of time. I've had them on my e36 for about 2 weeks now and the hood and trunk roundel have already discolored. Would have been rated higher otherwise
B0101A0C38|5|Loved them. Gave some to family members!.
B004R389M2|3|There was no opening at the rear of the frame rail big enough for the bolt to fit through.
B000C9GYOA|5|Worked like a champ.
B00B1TNQCS|4|Perfect fit
B00KGCN6LW|5|Directions aren't 100% clear, but it's not hard to install. Just take your time and look at it a few times.<br />Quality is very good and parts fit together well.
B007AOQORC|5|Good Product
B009W8HCUC|5|I really like the drawer.  The box is solid and the drawer opens nicely.  I do wish the drawer had an adjustable foot at the back of the drawer for support but it is not a deal breaker.  It was reasonably easy to install.
B002G38WLI|5|I am very satisfied with the purchase!
B000VBAHJC|5|Perfect fit, as expected.
B00HSXZ0PW|5|Item actually looks like a real 3D carbon fiber weave under a layer of clear epoxy protector.
B00ARURLZA|1|This is not a oem replacement part for a Ford Focus.
B001DDN0U0|2|Looks OK even tho its filled with vent holes. Problem is that it peeled up. I cleaned the tank as should be and let sit with no gas for 24hrs.
B001O2T43M|5|love it
B00SL34B08|5|Awesome and super easy to stick on
B00480BWCI|5|got these for under the corners of the popup stabilizers. First trip out, need 5 under each rear corner. Worked perfect.
B00MUF1APW|5|Extremely Bright they are!!!!!
B00HN4GTQK|5|Great price and delivery time
B007NNPFSY|5|Fast shipping perfect oem part  fits great
B00GPJPBBI|3|These might be great if your bulbs are easy to change.  Mine are not.  Bar chart on back of the package (not shown in seller's s photos) shows expected bulb lifetime is about half of a standard bulb.  Dec 21, 2015: Added pic of package in view of SanPa's comment.  To clarify, my headlights still work but I am not expecting a long lifetime because the manufacturer does not either.  I'm sorry that this chart does not have enough information to tell you exactly how long they will last.
B00HCROOR4|5|Great high quality ones, better then i expected.<br /><br />thanks a lot.
B00230EGXM|3|Didn't fit in the throttle housing,  had to sand the end down a bit. Other than that it works great
B00BGZ3DNE|5|I have a 2011 Kia Sportage. This fit perfectly over my key fob, I can even easily remove the back up manual key because the holes line up correctly.  It matches my orange car, and it doesn't have that weird film on it like some cheap rubbers do. I would definitely purchase again, I'll probably buy a second one for my spare keys.
B003VAYRNM|5|Hard to say much about an anode, heck, it is an anode.  This fits and is the recommended model for my SW10DE.  I must be lucky with water sources and I can go as long as 4 years with only about a 50% deterioration rate.  When they do get to about 50% I replace the anode.  I keep two spares as you never know when you or a buddy or neighbor will need one.  There is no &#34;O-ring&#34; for these.  I use sealant paste or tape, depends on what I have in the tool box that is easy to get to.
B00B5L3BT0|5|Fit perfectly, less then 3 minutes to install

B004YK4S1O|5|These valve stem caps dots all of the iiiiiiiii
B00UXJFQ8Y|5|Just as described and fits perfectly!
B00S5HRAS0|5|I purchased this for my 2011 Suzuki GSX1250FA, which is basically a Suzuki Bandit, but with an added lower fairing.  Installation was very straightforward and only took 30 minutes.  You can see my installation video on YouTube under RedonKiLaus if you are interested.  Comes with 3 sizes of hexagonal (Allen) stick wrenches but you will also need a small wrench set, and a Phillips type screwdriver.  Made in USA to the highest quality standards - well worth the money in my opinion.
B000765MHI|5|Helps out waiting on the wife at the grocery store.
B000GVD0VE|5|Purchased for my 2009 Yamaha TW200, and I love it.  I mounted it to my OEM Yamaha luggage rack, and it's really handy to have to haul some rain gear, tools, lunch, etc.  Like some other reviewers, I found that if I tightened the nuts on the mounting plate too tight, it tended to bend the mounting plate just enough to make it impossible to attach the case.  I solved that by leaving the nuts a little bit looser, but I added blue Loctite to them to make sure they don't vibrate loose.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I was not bothered by the injection molding mark under the dumb sticker on top; it's not nearly as bad as they made it sound.<br /><br />Having ridden in an couple of brief showers, and also left it outside during a torrential downpour, it is waterproof.  There was no leakage inside after a regular gully-washer blew through, which I thought was pretty impressive.
B000630HW2|5|great product
B00UJ9BPC4|4|It is not hot pink as stated but still cute. So I gave it 4 stars
B00XR4HN3S|5|Excellent fit, quality, and delivery time.
B00BQLVPWE|5|Worked great and fit the car perfectly.
B00EF3RC90|2|Very slow shipping but happy with
B005VA5PEK|5|I bought this to replace an older Nolan.  I really enjoy the convenience of a flip front helmet and this is probably equal to any others on the market.  I need 3XL and have been satisfied with the fit.  At this point I have about 2000 miles on the helmet, riding on a BMW R1200RT - bikes with less effective windshields may show a different experience.<br /><br />Most of the other reviews are fairly accurate.  The micro-click chin strap is convenient, but I wish it was a little bit longer.  Ventilation is OK.  Flip front helmets are noisier in general, I recommend ear plugs no matter what helmet you wear.<br /><br />The controls are very notch when new, and don't quickly get smoother, although I can feel a change.  The advantage is that the flip shield stays cracked at higher speeds than my prior Nolan...still flips down about 80-85 MPH.<br /><br />The release button has not worked a couple of times as reported in a couple of other reviews.  What I have found is that firmly pressing the chin guard as though you were trying to close it rather than open it gets things seated better and the release normally works normally after that.  Avoiding this may just require closing the helmet more firmly.  But I can still take off the helmet without opening it anyway.<br /><br />If you don't have a flip front helmet, this is a good place to start.  If you are looking to replace yours, this is a good choice.  And keep the helmet side up...
B005CUG1EC|5|This was an easy install, have to cut off the tail pipe, since I didn't have a hoist. But the instructions tell you that.<br />Sounds great!! The wife even like the way it sounds.
B00393NDHW|1|I put these on my scooter and you can't even tell they're on
B00LTMW5YW|5|Amazing look for the bike!
B005GX3GFW|1|Unsafe. My friend said it could catch on a sleeve and hang up the steering wheel. When I tried to return it the company gave me a refund, but did not want the item back. ?
B00SH33Y00|1|None of the 8 worked for me, these are extremely cheaply made.
B001V3131A|4|Really good quality sun glasses! Even when its a bit over cast or for driving at night it helps with the glare. I would buy them again!
B00BCRMA9Y|1|Those two seats on the front are the only fitted the rest no,including the steering cover
B00CJHKQ1A|5|Very basic patterns but informative on setting up warp threads
B00J8F1BGA|5|Came on time. Fits my 2012 dodge 1500 quad cab like a glove!! Thick, durable feeling material. Didn't get to test in the rain yet. Over all really happy with this cover.
B00VS0T7IC|5|I had my tires filled at my mechanics to 30psi. I used this gauge to check the pressure and it read exactly 30psi.
B000NNON7U|2|The construction is much better than other covers on here, thicker material that will last longer. For the price I think what you get in that area is excellent. However it is too small. I have a 2007 CBR600RR and this cover does not fully cover the rear tire. So if your bike is in the sun and you don't want the tire rubber getting sun damaged this won't work.  I bought the &#34;Sport&#34; thinking that would be correct.
B001C6Q6X6|5|Fixed the problem and it was a great price.
B00X04JRMU|5|This is the best product I have ever used. Cleans, shines and removes bugs.
B001AIZ5HY|5|I used this kit to restore one of the plastic opening hatches on my boat, and it worked GREAT!  One hatch used about 1/2 of the material in the kit, so there is a plenty to do 2 or more hatches.  Mine was REALLY bad, you couldn't even see through it, and now, it's as clear as a brand new one.  VERY easy to use and comes with detailed instructions.
B004RSYTIA|4|Good buy - good fit
B00D3QQUGG|4|We are trying to give a heads up to other drivers that we are teaching a new driver to be safe on the road and asking for a little patience and space.  These magnets go on easy, look great, are noticeable, and really do what we hoped for.  However, they go on when the student drives and off when the adults drive.  After just a couple of weeks of use, the corners have started to peel (see photo).  They are not falling off but starting to show signs of wear too early.  Yes, I would buy them again.
B000VL9WTS|1|says it will fit with the soft top folded down NO IT WILL NOT.  Even with out the soft top bows installed it will not fit the 2013 Sahara worth a crap. the sides of the back are still partially uncovered at the base which means rain will come right in.  Also why would you make it water proof and then put two holes in the sides of it mid front door to tie it down?
B00QDWQSBO|5|Works perfectly!
B000WKAV52|5|Handy information with complete instructions
B002VPLB32|5|Good price
B001GC2LVM|5|I can not say enough good things about these levelers and I know your probably on the fence about purchasing becuase of the price but after using them just once it was perfectly clear they are well well worth the investment! For most fellow travel trailer owners you probably have two axels so you will need to purchase two of them, but as I said they are well worth the money and are a huge time and frustration saver. I did read that a few people had problems with them cracking but I just don;t see that happening to me, they claim they hold up to 10,000lbs and if your properly using two of them you should never break one. I have used them on straight up concrete, grass, and rocky ground and they did not crack, sink or move on me at all as of yet and I have used them a great deal already this summer. Now the one thing I will also mention in regards to the double axel and having to use two of them is that my axels are fairly close together to each other and so I had to use a circular saw to shave one of them down so it was shorter, they actually have instructions on this when you buy them that if I recall say you can safely cut off up to 4 inches but I only needed to cut off two inches for mine to work.<br /><br />Buy these and stop overthinking it already they are a  great invention and should come standard with all RV Travel Trailers!
B013MKW2AU|5|Product is a tiny bit darker than the oem panel, but I actually like it more.<br /><br />Overall awesome product. Great quality, and way cleaner than using a pillar gauge.<br />Customer service is A+<br />Perfect fitment
B000SL0R9K|4|Good first-aid kit, a little bigger than you'd expect but I still made space for it in my Camelbak. I don't recommend hanging it off your backpack by the Carabiner, as 1) the Carabiner is cheap and will break easily and 2) the bag could easily be caught on something.<br /><br />Still, it's a decent kit and case-quality is solid. I'd recommend it!
B008CE0R5E|5|great!
B00AQZB0V2|5|The installation was straight forward. Now some four months later the unit still continues to work well.
B000C2EE3U|5|Top of the line. Can't ever go wrong with felpro
B00EXGRRJE|5|Excellent item, Too Brigth
B00YIBJ8AU|5|Super bright LEDs! They look great even in the daytime. I wish they were a full circle but still very happy with the product
B003CK0PCS|5|Yeah
B001H1O688|5|The product is exactly what it says. Had a 2010 Fusion, it will not fit a 2013 - xxxx current bodystyle, as there is now an additional flap in the filler nozzle.
B001BK4A7W|5|Better than original, my original had a add on spot mirror this passenger mirror is convex in order to give you a better view so you don't need a spot mirror.
B002ZTOOI8|5|Excellent
B00OQS6CYA|5|These are my favorite use them on about every job
B000LGW58I|5|I purchased these as a gift and thought I was purchasing a pair. This is not the case, they are sold separately! I purchased a 2nd one & all was well. Purchased for an 09 Yamaha Grizzly 550.
B0089LSFJ0|5|item as described. Excellent customer service.
B0089HRTIW|1|This product is flawed along with their claims of sending a manual. Had this item installed in my truck and it worked for just over 30 days. Now the unit is failing to work properly and engages the engine kill feature even after you hit the unlock button. it disarms and rearms the unit right away. When I contacted their &#34;tech support&#34; I was told to take it back to the dealership and have them uninstall the unit because it is not their products fault it does not work right. The &#34;tech support&#34; is their warehouse and they can not fix anything. Their &#34;high tech support&#34; can only be reached by email because they have no phone, are in china, and do not speak English. So even if the unit is obviously not working properly like the button to turn the arm beep sound off now locks and arms the unit instead of turning the beep off this is not a system malfunction it must be a fuse or installation issue. But either way its not their fault and i just need to have my car towed to a dealer and pay to have it uninstalled. This product and its company are a joke and should be avoided at all cost.
B00997QADQ|5|Work g.ood
B00L1S0JU6|5|Towel works great,would definitely buy again!--Mark, from NH
B001AWU6KQ|3|Not to stronger
B00A14QNP6|5|works great
B000CMDCKQ|5|Nice added protection and a great help on getting into the back of the truck.
B008BCDKNI|3|Product doubled in cost since last year.
B0016HURK4|3|There are many volume knobs out there and it is difficult to pick the correct one for your radio. This one looked the same but was not. However it did fit and does work to control the volume. The only thing it won't do is turn off the radio as it does not sit flush enough to be able to push it in.
B000C7LYTW|4|I haven't had to actually use the 4wd yet but quality seem good all metal think I might buy an extra set just to have on hand..
B007XE8C74|5|Works great! I/M ready check is quick and easy. After giving the manual a quick read the tool was more than self explanatory. The screen size is perfect and the unit feels comfortable in the hand.  Quality seems to be sufficient as well.
B009DJYQZ4|5|works great they wanted $40 for the same part at the store
B000C8Z7PI|5|I bought it to replace a broken rusted muffler and I liked the sound of it so much I just bought another one for the other side on my 79 Corvette.
B000KKLLX0|3|hard to install in my 2004 dodge 1500 P/U
B00BCRMAAS|2|Not Easy to put the seat covers like this. very sensitive one's. Not that much happy with this
B00V5BTCYI|5|Good stuff, water beads right off
B0034HNNHS|5|Shipped quickly, arrived as described.  Very solid filter, it feels good :)
B0023VE172|5|Great price, quick delivery, and good fit .could not be more pleased ..
B000EQQ5MC|5|as advetize
B0001EWQUW|5|This was ordered for another Jeep we just purchased. We have on our other Jeep and are very happy with it.
B00GUS5UUG|4|Good quality rubber.  No odor. Fit 2015 Nissan Rogue SV AWD. But the cuts of the corners of the back mats are a little too deep to my like.
B00GLLW3AM|5|EXCELENT
B000O825QU|5|Great tool save me time and it's very handy. No need to pry under the car.
B000WZVYRQ|5|Product arrived 2 days before the extimated time and the product works pretty good
B005VWRAIC|5|After lots of research ordered genuine Toyota hatch latch for my '04  4Runner SR5. Checked forums for installation instructions. Part arrived one day early and looked identical to original latch.  Followed installation procedures from other reviews but latch would not unlock. Tried both disconnecting battery and disconnecting computer module inside back liftgate in order to reset computer.  It would lock down but not release. DO NOT REMOVE PUll CORD used to manually open lock until you get it working! After a half hour without success I had a Zen moment and tried using my vehicle toyota valet key to lock and unlock the liftgate. It worked! Now the latch works perfectly and I'm a very happy camper.
B00NGFP5S8|1|Ball screws necessary for installation were not provided.
B00E1JO6CO|1|It didn't fit
B005CMPM0Y|5|As expected.
B00HESFIJ4|5|Arrived quickly and works great.  :-)
B00QEC0ANA|5|fits perfectly.
B004PBC9LS|5|Great product!  Install was easy and they look great!
B000NE7TJ8|5|Perfect fit for my 96 silverado k1500
B00OLRCKQK|5|The pump was worth every dollar. I have been using the low dollar budget pumps and they do not last. Time to step up and buy a pump that will work more efficient and wont require me to replace it every 12 to 16 months.
B00OBWKFXU|5|Good product! Very good quality
B000BOA0BY|5|Perfact for my job
B006CSSKCO|5|Worked like a charm.
B004JHBKLS|5|good product  I will buy it again
B004GFTC0E|5|Complete kit  Took about an hour for two head lights (Ponitac Grand Prix)
B000OP6KLY|5|my Massey Ferguson 231 seems to like it fine - still has a purple tint after 55 hours.
B00VGL71X6|5|It works and looks good.
B000C7S0W6|5|Fast and as described
B00S7KQRVG|4|This item was exactly as described and fit my needs. It was about a 1/4&#34; longer than the one that came out but that was of no concern to me. Fits and functions as needed.
B000SL0R9K|4|I keep it in my car; fortunately I haven't had to use it, but it would be quite handy. Everything was exactly as listed.
B00H1THXWG|4|Plug and play ... Haven't failed and that's rare for cheaper hid kits!
B004XX5RJE|3|the diameter is what it should be but the bits snag on hard wood--better to spend a little more or buy a different bit than have the bit catch in wood (on a drill press at that).
B005S09XUA|5|Well made product , easy to install by one person. Used it to load 2 bags on a 300 miles trip. So far so good. It did make the car a bit noisy especially going at 70 mile/hr. It looks identical to OEM.
B0002UNON8|1|does not work on my scratches I hope I can return it
B0002YUQ4E|2|I bought this because of the good reviews.I work on a boat and we have aluminum doors that we polish every 10 days.Semichrome,with an electric Autospa polisher does a job equivalent to cheap Mothers.Better off saving a bunch of money and use mothers,which the boat supplies because it's cheap.This is my opinion of how the product works on aluminum only.I haven't tried it with any other metals.
B00K9BGFHM|5|Fast shipping, will purchase in the future
B008MISF54|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B009DJSJ8E|5|Works great. Better than the one it replaced
B00LU4K6QS|5|Love it.!!  So cute my son said.!! Thanks. 😀😀
B00CPTBEZO|5|We keep this in our tornado shelter at home, to force the door and any debris that may be on top of it. Thankfully, we haven't had to us it for that, yet, but I've also lifted an SUV with it, and it did just fine.
B000CCDNSW|5|Awesome part !!!
B00JMCCSRK|1|when the package arrived, opened, there is one bottle leak.  it is spill over the plastic bag and also bottom of the outside package.  And when I measure it, it leak total of half quart.
B00LTHWLTQ|5|Adorable and easy to install. It is just the right size, not too big.
B0085D0QEE|5|Good fit
B00OXSALUY|1|This came in two pieces. One double sided sticker and one rubber piece. Not what I assumed this would be. The sticker wasn't even the same size as the rubber this would have cause a lot of issues later. Don't order youll be kicking yourself later.
B001AXBON8|3|it gets a 4 for looks only..  when i got this it was 3&#34;  and i need 2 1/2&#34; can't seem to find 2 1/2&#34; .
B00B8Z79FK|5|Good!
B000IYR7HC|5|fit perfectly
B00HS8X53Q|2|Got these for my 2006 Honda Rebel. I already had Biltwell Frisco bars on the bike, and the stock mirrors just sat at a bad angle with the straighter bars. These mirrors fit well, and look pretty good on the bike. The mirror housings are just plastic, but look nice. The mirror stalks are solid, beefy metal parts.<br />The only reason I only give it 2 stars is because when the engine revs up, the mirrors vibrate horribly bad! Sitting at idle, the view is clear, but when you're moving, everything is a blur in the mirrors.<br />They look nice, but I wouldn't buy them again. Better to spend a bit more for sturdier mirrors.
B007Y86RRG|5|We ordered this part for our truck that my husband refuses to trade in and was very pleased with the product, the time frame in which we received the part and the fact that it is working great.  Will recommend DB Electrical to our friends and family.  Thank you for your help.
B000GU5V2G|5|Replaced what it was ment to replace. Worked better than the dead one that this replaced! My motorcycle now charges it's battery again! Woo!
B00S4J0HFC|5|One of the better drying towels to purchase.
B002P8AST8|5|Worked out great - fit like a charm, easy to install.
B00BI2APMW|5|Works perfectly in my 2010 Ford pickup. Small size makes it east to store in the glove-box or console.
B00GHMO6W8|1|I submitted an earlier review. The product was not as advertised. Was not padded.
B00C59DSYO|5|Nice - made will - fit perfect - sure do have to be a little person to get in there to fix it - but it wasn't hard
B00B81772Y|4|This is nice, but then you can not use the OEM connector for GM vehicles.  I just zip tied mine to it.  That works fine.  This is design just for the Curt receptacle.
B00M8BR4SU|5|just what we needed to lock the awning in place for travel.
B004J6KFME|5|So far so good
B000S2VXRE|4|Exactly what I needed.
B00DZKCXD4|5|good quality
B003JTYGPO|4|Seems to work well, though Red Line seems to work better.
B006HFV2XQ|2|Product did not specify what Wench it would fit. It was the wrong one for our wench.
B004GYY2FK|1|Poorly constructed.  Internal switch broke in only two days after installation.  Internal switch was not properly secured and moved up causing backup lamps to remain on all the time.
B00E9HWSV4|5|Item match description; very useful. Thank you
B00K35RSRA|5|Fits great
B008G1WI4G|5|fit perfectly on my 04 gmc canyon
B00042K39C|2|Setting up lamps for install - installed bracket on lamp and one of the bolts broke off in the housing.<br />Not sure of what to do next.
B00B0YYVP0|5|A++++ perfect right part good seller.
B0065UNT16|5|direct replacement for my vehicle
B007WW3DAI|5|Exactly as described. Thank you easy to replace.
B003VGL20W|5|Excellent quality. Fit perfectly and no need to bend anything to make them fix ..KUDOS to you
B00VF7HZF0|5|USB works great,  haven't had to use the cigarette lighter side yet
B00ZQ16674|5|Nothing else can say. Love them
B001Y8NF90|3|If you are in someplace with soft ground, then you can use these, but so far, the ground is to hard where I go. I have used the straps though, just attaching them to other things. would not buy this again.
B00MPXMLHU|5|love it thanks again !!!!
B00E1JBQOA|5|Using under recycling bin. Perfect size and solves a messy problem.
B0058SGFLM|5|heavy duty switch
B0016LG2G8|5|This stuff is amazing. I actually bought it for the environmental features. But this stuff performs far far beyond my expectations and experience with other products environmentally safe or not. My cars are cleaner than I've ever seen and afterward dirt doesn't stick! I live in a harsh costal environment with salty air and fine blowing sand. Also...makes bugs really easy to remove, hardly need to scrub. Amazing stuff. Buy it.
B00K6D487C|5|Excelente producto
B0018YIL4O|4|This fixed my Death Wobble! It wasn't hard to install. The instructions need to explain better why to file the metal. The only problem, is the main bracket continues to slide down around the front axle. I have tightened it again... still drops.
B003T0611A|5|Exactly as advertised and needed.  Mounted easy.
B002ZTNV6Y|5|Love them
B00EJOT6A8|5|Definitely much better than the plastic factory screw.  Would highly recommend it to others in need.
B001IZKDZI|4|Nice cover but seems to be very large for a 10'
B00HQEL5PM|5|Great product
B00M0443ZW|3|These are now spares for another use.  Quality is there but you should measure your existing bulbs before ordering.  The base is the right # but the bulb is about 1/32&#34; too long for the unit to go back into the housing on my F150 license plate fixtures.  Luckily I had a different bulb set that was just a touch shorter that fit.
B0017J7NQ2|5|Very easy to assemble. SWR 1.2:1 on Ch 19; 1.3:1 on Ch 1 and 40. The A-99 is also a fantastic receive antenna on VHF low band. Patriot-12 ground plane kits will fit the A-99 if you enlarge the hole in the aluminum collar with a 1.25&#34; hole saw bit from Lowes.
B00KZJQ2L2|4|Fits very well and folds intuitively without much effort. Simply fold it in half than in half again and allow it to begin to twist and it almost folds itself.  Fits well, not perfectly, but good enough to keep the truck cooler and the sun off the wheel and the dash.  I bought this for a 2014 RAM 1500.
B000KYX25G|5|Works great! No problems
B008G4YMHY|4|works fine, I had to make a few minor changes to the wires on my 83 Honda Silverwing but it works. I had to add wires to the loom for my clutch switch but was no big deal. nice compact size.
B006FXUMO0|5|I've read other reviews that say the green wire is too short. You will not have that problem if installed this way. Open the jack compartment and remove the jack. I also removed the air compressor and put it in the stow n go storage bin so I can keep the hitch ball and tongue in the jack compartment. Remove the left taillight. In the rear corner of the jack compartment there is a square rubber grommet. Pull it out. Then, behind that grommet is a square air vent. Pop the air vent out and put the brown and yellow wires through. Pop the air vent back on with the wires going through the top of the air vent. Put the grommet back in, connect the taillight, and reinstall it. Next remove the right taillight. Remove the panel that goes along the bottom of the tailgate opening. It just snaps out. Run the green wire under the carpet. Next, remove the cargo hook on the right side of the rear panel and pull the rear panel back. In the corner you will see the square grommet just like the other side. Remove it. Remove the air vent, just like the other side. Run the green wire through the hole. Snap the air vent back in. Replace the grommet. Connect the right taillight and reinstall it. Push the rear side panel back in and reinstall the cargo hook. Reinstall the lower tailgate panel. Inside the jack storage compartment, find a bare metal spot and drill a hole for the ground wire. I like to sand the paint off around the hole just to ensure a good ground. Attach the ground wire. For the power wire, start inside the jack compartment and run the wire along the left side of the vehicle. Just push the wire under the plastic panel as you go along. When you get to the sliding door, pop the lower panel off and run the wire through. Next remove the front door lower panel. You have to remove 1 nut from the umbrella tray, then the panel pops out. Pop the B-pillar cover out enough to run the wire under it. Run the wire along the bottom of the front door. Pop the kick panel off and run the wireunder it. Next, find the hood release cable under the dash and pull in the grommet from the firewall. Slide the grommet down the cable. Push a screwdriver through the grommet and stretch the opening so you can push the wire through. Keep pushing the wire through the grommet and through the hole in the firewall until you can go under the hood and reach the wire. Replace the grommet in the firewall. Go under the hood and pull the wire into the engine compartment. Be sure to leave some slack. Replace all the door panels making sure the wire is underneath them. Go back to the jack compartment and connect the wire to the black box. Go under the hood and  trim the excess wire and connect the fuse and connect the wire to the battery. You are done! When in use, pull the four pin trailer connector out of the jack compartment and run it out the back and shut the tailgate on the wires. When not in use, keep the wires inside the jack compartment. If installed this way, the wires are never exposed to the weather or elements. There are no zip ties required, and the wires are invisible when not in use.
B000O0RVC6|5|Before I installed this, my truck wouldn't start without having the ignition switch hanging out of the dash.  Needless to say, it looked like I was driving a stolen truck.  But after three hours of wrenching and a lot of cursing, this bad boy now helps makes my truck start and keeps the cops from asking too many questions.  Yay for new parts.
B009ET15MU|1|i was told they were for my car and they were not for my car they didnt fit and i cant put the head rest back on because there are no holes for them.
B007VR8PA2|3|Kinda cheap, point  doesn't hold up, wire can easily roll in the cradle.
B004809YBE|5|excellent heavy duty cord
B0002JMIEK|5|Great
B00KSY3HFS|5|I made the mistake of ordering the medium size which according to measurement was very close to what I needed.  Upon receipt, I found that it would not stay in place and my visors are stupid small.  I contacted the company and they told me of their impending &#34;Large&#34; size and offered to do an exchange when the new product was available.  I have the new large size and everything is wonderful.  Thanks very much to Brialin (seller) for the great customer service.  The little pouch that comes with the sunshade is very handy also.  I tuck my folded up shade between the front console and front seat when not in use.
B0057Y5EFK|5|This is a strong well made socket and I am sure it will last a lifetime.
B00VB2OE9O|5|Perfect fit for my GS300 lexus!
B0017K69MA|4|Just used this for the first time to clean the windshield of my car that is pretty steeply raked.  I found the microfiber cover to fit snug and the usage very easy once I got it in the proper orientation.  No more having to stretch to clean the furtherest corners towards to the dashboard.  This tool makes cleaning the windshield a breeze.  Recommended.
B00T36KG42|5|Works well.  I was concerned that junk would get trapped in the blocks making them difficult to stack back together - that doesn't happen.  The carrying handle is especially useful.
B002MYG8L2|5|Looks great and I installed it in about 1 hour. I like it!
B001LA18WM|5|Cool!
B00TY78HKA|5|Beautiful and great material. I love it!
B002807WV0|4|Worked well
B0002NYDYO|5|Clean and no messy fingers!!!
B005PODERM|5|I was a little skeptical at first but did some research and said what the heck I'll give it a shot. I'm restoring a 1996 Volvo 850 and this WORKS GREAT!!!!  It took 2 coats and i have 75% of the bottle left. I highly recommend this product. Thank you it is worth the money
B00EF1EW6S|4|product is as advertised. not fond of the tape strips to hold the top corners in place. not sure I see them holding on for long. seems like some kind of clip could have been designed to avoid drilling. I will talk to a friend with a machine shop - or break down and drill a whole on each side...
B00G4RXQDG|5|Good
B008PIHAY8|5|Great, in place and performing well. Thanks
B00HS5DRG4|5|Great fit.  Easy to install.
B000TROIGQ|5|Makes life easy on the knees
B00EU265R6|5|Great
B005G5R5LQ|5|Well made. Filter is a plus ! Recommend
B00F74IP74|5|Great little bench and handy storage space, can be sat on and even turned up on its side to serve as a step or stationary stool.
B004SF3PMI|5|used this in my 97 f-250 HD fit like it should, good parts.
B0083G3AXC|4|Fit our chairs with no issues. Very pleased especially when considering the reasonable price.
B003CJCCKM|5|The part was easy to install and took me no longer than 30 min. to get my bike back up and running...
B00XKY89AG|5|This item has kept the back of my SUV organized. Bought one for my son after I saw the back of his SUV.
B000COVO90|5|Great product and everything was great after installations.
B005JU5W54|5|Really like these wipers, so much better than the ones that came on my Accord.
B00JN0U4SQ|5|Works great and easy to install.
B00BITI7KM|4|just like the factory ones that came off of the car. Perfect fit and true to color.
B000BOC2E2|4|Keep it on hand for problem days and works for me
B00D0MSX36|5|ungefär 250 svenska bagis var den verkligen värd. visserligen 430 med frakt men fortfarande !!
B000C7YR5U|5|I have already used
B000C9Q1MK|5|Had a thumping noise and now I don't. Bolted right up. I changed both sides in less than 20 minutes. And these look like they are a better quality than the originals.
B00LHKRV72|5|Ok I have on my Motorcycle and trailer for months!  Reliable and easy to install.
B0013UBC7Q|5|Perfect sound, deep rumble, is not very load just enough to say I'm here!! built very heavy, welded very good. I used a glass pack as a resonator then the thrush...
B00FFH0RT2|5|Just a perfect little sticker for your car. Nothing to complain about, it`s just a very good buy.
B000GZVIJG|5|Very nice tool kit. Compact and everything needed for Harley FLSTC
B00BCRMC3I|1|Bad Quality Don't buy
B000GU0HW0|3|did not match OEM installation OK but lens attached differnt than original very obvious from behind when viewed.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Excellent product, very sturdy.  We used it for a 20h road trip.  I watched as we drove other people that had the cheaper models and they looked as if they were sagging or bent under the weight of the cargo.  This one had no sagging, was larger than most and therefore help more items.  The flip side is that since it is so sturdy it is pretty heavy material when putting it on or taking it off.  I was able to do it by myself but it's a slightly awkward 60+ pounds.
B00EAM749O|1|Cheap wiring harness broken before it even got to the car ground wire already been cut and taped back up.
B0000AXC24|5|Great quality Milton product.
B00GWWVXO2|5|MY SECOND SET OF COVERS FROM RAZER,SUPER NICE PRODUCT,LOOKS LIKE CHROME METAL,STAYS PUT,VERY WELL MADE TO FIT,FAST SHIPPING,SUPER SERVICE,THANK YOU
B009S9RURU|5|This is the coolest baby sticker you can have. Everyone asks about it
B000JFJLQA|5|Great fluid pan, holds tons of fluid.  I have been using this pan for oil changes, transmission fluid changes, differential fluid changes and have not had one problem with it.  It has a nice large opening for the fluid to drain and a spout for easy emptying.  The spout helps you pour your used fluid into your containers for easy recycling.
B004ZMU13K|5|Product is good.  Just make sure you get the original and not a knock-off.
B00LUS8K9Y|5|Great price for a quality product.
B000J41VAA|5|I love it. It works great for me.
B00Y4IPN10|3|Product received wasn't as pictured. Granted, it was red as I'd ordered, but the emblem was completely different from the one pictured, and the one received I don't care for the look of. Good thing (I guess) that the emblem wasn't even affixed to the cap itself.  Oh well, it serves it's purpose.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|This works really well for my husband's car.  He could not keep the tissue box where there was access.  This solves that perfectly.  Also having a place to keep trash has definitely cleaned up his car.  Thank you!
B0055OEZDY|4|Works great with the helmet and holds the flashlight very nicely
B00IZZJYOU|1|It's a nice cap but the color was no where close to what was shown! It's not dark blue it's aqua and looks horrible.
B00COYNZJ8|4|Hilarious product! Looks great in the car and lines up perfectly.<br />BUT!<br />Looking back at my order, it looks like I ordered it June 2014. Little over a year later, I have found myself in need of a new sunshade unfortunately...<br />The hot Florida days we have had has just made the shade go limp and fade pretty bad. By the time I get out of work, half of it has fallen out of position from the visors, and to make it even more sad, I find little flakes of it in the car. Don't dare touch the steering wheel! Ouch!<br /><br />This is by no means meant to be &#34;the sunshade to last forever&#34; - it's for a good laugh.<br />When it was in its prime, it really did do its job and kept the car cool. (It was ok to touch the steering wheel then!) Was a great purchase, just wish it lasted a bit longer.<br /><br />If you're interested in this then you obviously have a sense of humor. For the price, do it. But I won't...(looks around)...FORCE you. Heyyy ohhh.
B006WDQZ2G|5|For my electric guitar mod.
B00TI0DE4W|4|I used this fan as my AC condenser fan on my 91 Civic DX that was having overheating problems. I can say that it works well, but the mounting tabs are subpar. I ended up zip tying them of all things. I think my relays/power dont allow it to work at its full capacity, but it DOES work very well for my needs. I wish I had gotten black but it wasnt in stock at the time I ordered. red just clashes with my green engine bay HAHA.
B00080QHMM|5|Accurate. Simple and easy to use.
B00479SK66|5|i was very pleased with the updated look the emblem gave my cedes
B00OXPXUAK|3|it doesnt work with my car!
B004I14AKS|4|EVEN WITH ALL THE HUSTLE AND HECTIC PACE OF E-RETAIL, THIS WENT WELL, THANKS
B01147R3FM|5|I've ordered these bulbs for my VW Touareg, and I'm completely satisfied with my purchase so far. I had no issues with replacing the old bulbs with these new ones, and these bulbs provide clear and powerful light. Will see how long they last.
B009H51XBO|5|Great
B00318NQL8|5|so far so good.
B008O0MTUC|4|Quality is ok
B00CICZBH0|4|OEM Honda pads os the ad says
B005H49GTA|5|bought it to use with the Pioneer AVH-P6300BT DVD Receiver in my Ford van and it worked as advertised and was pretty straight forward to install.
B00CEKNB0K|4|Good brightness, there are brighter out there, but at this price point, these are good lights.  Sync cable nice feature.
B00YQA7FFI|4|Nice pants for the price. Haven't tested in heavy rain is r super cold conditions yet. Not the best fit. A bit bulky and slick on the seat. Can't really beat it for the price though.
B000OO0TO4|5|It's good
B00BITKCIW|4|good
B00EO5ZBOM|4|This product works well, although not better than the other eco car washes I have used. It's just a basic, good product, just not better than the others I have tried. If you're looking for a decent  eco  car wash, this should do it.
B0002KR88A|5|This is just what I ordered work great.
B003171YWC|5|Quick delivery and looks great!
B00GJK4X8U|5|Stepper motors did the trick save me $350.00 dollars to fix my 2005  Monte Carlo cluster will recommend.
B006872DFO|4|Received with thank but it has a minor thing that it doesn't cover the headlamps.
B00PW30ZPU|5|The thin ice layer that forms on the surface of the windscreen is very dangerous and makes the whole windshield very fragile. This product from Exlight is intended to this specific reason, that is, is to save your windshield from snow and frost issues without shedding loads of money.
B001KO875U|5|Fits 96 Suzuki dr350se, works well for the money, quick rebuild of you can get the stripped out screws out of your bowl from the previous owner.
B001GMN6FM|5|Beautiful!  Mom loves it~  Quick ship<br />Thank you ~
B00FZM4YHS|5|Had error P0446 on 2003 Avalon.  Diagnosed problem being this component.  Verified with seller that it would fit 2003 Toyota Avalon and installed with no problems.  Error corrected and working as expected.
B007RWV9TU|5|Awesome bag. A lot of pockets, lots of space. Great price too
B00KNMKRU8|5|Great little charger!  I would buy again!  In fact I sent one to my father!
B000ALJ4NS|1|I've used many Permatex products over the years and have always been satisfied with them. Previously I've used the 30 minute two-part epoxy and have been satisfied. I don't particularly like the applicator - would prefer two separate tubes. However, with the 30 minute stuff, I've never had any harden in the tube - I'm always careful not to cross-contaminate. However, after using only about 20% of the five minute stuff I bought only a couple of months ago, one of the materials could only be forced out of the tube with great pressure applied, and then as a bead of rubber which could not be mixed with the other part. Maybe I had a bad batch, but I think I'll stick with the 30 minute stuff.
B00CDXBFHO|5|Matches, what else do I need to say?
B009OQ13XY|5|Love this!!! Got this to rep my sons ball team called Tigers.
B000BWCG2M|3|WILL NOT FIT SQUARE PORT HEADERS
B0018EPX7M|5|Great seat. Very comfortable. Great service
B000HTNPLU|3|This solvent is very oily, so it look quite a bit of compressed air to clear it from my evaporator core. I probably would not use this product again if I had another option. I tried this product [[ASIN:B000E0Z6NM Four Seasons 69991 Dura II Flush Solvent - 1 Qt]] and felt it was much more effective.
B005P5DLGK|5|Good treatment for the zippers and seems to help with binding. The best use is to use it just before storing the top for the winter months.
B008CE0R5E|4|These are not cheap light weight blocks. But, the don't slide of move. So far they have been great. There is a chemical/ruber order to them, but that is going away with time letting them &#34;Air Out&#34;.  They work, the price it good.
B00CKKFDPA|5|Awesome lights, easy to work, easy to install. Only one thing is I broke one of the strands and cannot find a replacement for them. For $27 I will buy another set and have back ups.
B00ID7FKK2|5|Worked great
B00ADHQ0LI|2|Didnt work put the old part back & acheived one locally...
B00KBAJSOS|5|Exactly what I wanted, very nice!
B000CO7WPK|5|Great shocks...great price!
B00OPMIR2M|5|works great.
B009IJQ8HS|5|Meets expectations for portable boat hose. My old one lasted 10 years.
B001MXL71A|4|Good
B000F6F99G|5|This is very easy to install and set up.  From earlier reviews, people said you can only rotate them inline, not side to side.  This version at least has a full ball socket connection for the lights, so there is full adjust-ability.  Nice bright laser light, no problem with it turning off too early.
B000BG1X54|5|I use this just about every day at work to siphon diesel from our gas cans to our cat 416e. This thing works wonders we were always having to suck the diesel out with a piece of garden hose and of course somebody always ended up drinking a little bit. Since i got this product nobody in my crew has drank any diesel. Other crews want one too because they see how efficient it is. I already ordered an extra one just in case the one i have fails.
B00BQVH442|5|I bought these hoping for a bright white light that matched some PIAA off-road light I have and they look just as bright and white as the PIAA lights.  Vary happy with them.
B00KCQSOAA|5|On time and looks and feels great.  great value
B0039ILD42|5|Work like OEM filter.  It cost nearly $12 at Amazon.  It took me 10 minutes to replace filter.  Honda dealer will charge more than $100 including installation.
B00FF8PGRY|5|These are the original factory rubber mats for the Forrester.  They are rugged, well finished, and have a perfect it.  Make sure you remove the driver's side carpet mat before installing the rubber mat, so you can latch it to the floor prongs, to prevent it from sliding forward, and jamming the accelerator pedal!  The others can just be placed above the existing carpet mats.  I saved $20 buying them from Amazon, instead of the dealer.
B008VSYDT2|5|Just what we wanted
B00079V5ZI|5|i installed these horns on elantra 2011, it is very loud, but not annoying, the sound is good, the tones are good, i love it, so far

B000C6IXKG|4|Pure oil now!
B0026KSMYI|5|It's what we expected.
B00DJAHN0I|5|Looks great, even used it on my 2014 avenger :) arrived on time also
B005HJODS4|5|Must have show off for your car haha
B00H6XPZN6|4|They work fine.  I wish they were just a little larger so they fit the mini-van window better.
B005QPDFEW|5|Look & fit awesome.
B000IYBF48|5|That's fit and work good on my 2003 handa crv LX
B00BOVDCPE|5|LooKS like the pic fits the new expats aND holds it great no problems and  it has been stuck on my winow since Monday and has not falling
B00BYNJ90E|4|Difficult to install because of added length, stretches a-frames out to maximum, clearances look good once the truck is back down on the ground.Top threaded ends need to have a longer section of threads, barely able to get the nut started with the washers and grommets on, flattens grommets down further than I would have liked.<br />Seems to be fine once completed.
B002LI172Y|5|looks great, easy to put on...looks like it will last a while.
B00ED3YVWS|5|Great bulbs! Super bright white light. Using as reverse lights in 2015 jeep rubicon.
B009IFIGR2|5|Fit like a glove
B004PX8BC2|5|I wanted a small jack that would not take up much space in the cargo trailer that I pull behind my Honda Goldwing on my roadtrips and this one fit my needs perfectly!
B00JA80PEO|5|set this up yesterday... call quality for me and the caller is great! they can hear me and i can hear them just fine. Plays music well personally id like it louder but i guess that wouldnt be safe! overall great product... so far im stoked and i dont have to deal with ear buds which is painful and annoying.
B00DSD4HKU|5|Mom luvs this cat.
B00473T1O2|5|They look exactly as they are were shown and they look amazing on my car!
B000BNH0I6|5|Sounds good
B00FI0MS34|5|Must have tool.has come in handy so many times it's unbelievable. .
B001KRY6AC|5|great price, shipping and worked great
B000KKXQLU|1|Not even close to what was needed.  Total waste of money
B00IPS3GMI|5|I'm a total Castrol man and every time I use this oil my car just seems to perform like new again. Not to mention my engine has no build up internally for 100k that's awesome. Although I typically change it every 3k to 4k anyway because I'm a little rough on my car. Plus you can't beat the price amazon has this for. Must get if you prefer Castrol.
B000GUWCVO|1|I am very happy with this product.
B00KRJ9X20|5|love it
B001DRL6IE|5|Exactly what I needed.
B0075J2R3C|5|This sticker is so cute!!  I love it
B005O0BUAK|5|I own body shop fit perfectly no over hang exectly fitment i recommend purchase
B00993PBX0|5|I am sure I am not the only 2013-15 Prius owner that has scraped the lower part of the bumper on the sides at least. I love my Prius and after 1.5 years I already scraped both sides.  The bumper is just designed too low.  Touch up paint just made it more noticeable. I was lucky enough to track these bumpers down.  I think they look great and look like part of the car. I only needed two, but I have the other two for spare. Make sure to take your time to follow the instructions. Hopefully they will last throughout the different seasons. Not only have they covered my existing scratches up, they will protect the bumper from further damage, although I am much more careful parking near curbs. Thanks again for thinking of this product! Quick delivery too!
B00HLUOYT0|4|Seems to be nice quality. The red color is a little light though. Does the job. Fit is pretty good.
B0058I0T7S|4|Performs as expected and priced right.
B00PXKTQ9S|5|Great product quick shipping
B00I9IP1MM|5|Awesome floor mats! Match exactly like my front mats from Gander Mountain.

B0011N1TDC|5|Used in and old motor and they seal up good in cast iron
B005R0ADG4|5|Father said this was the cutest lil outfit
B00GGGWWK8|5|Great item which arrived expediently.  Thanks.

B00NTU18KY|1|came out of the box inoperable,didnt keep a consistent currant, the back light also doesnt stay on long enough,i would recommend another type
B004RH6A4W|5|Perfect for my 98 5.9 Limited ZJ. Great quality as always, Mopar.
B005FN2FZA|3|Headrests do not fit too well.
B008Y9K0OU|5|Had trouble finding this part at the auto shop, they only sale the whole assemly at 60 dollar, the lights was very hard to turn on, try amazon, find under 1 minutr, for almost nothing.
B00XHJMIWE|1|Does not work with ODIS 2.2.6<br />Unable to update to latest firmware
B010JRHAAQ|5|well pleased
B00EPF7680|5|Works great and has good pressure. Put it in a 1996 Ford F700. Saved $300 by rebuilding the unit instead of buying a new unit from the dealership. Wish I knew you could just replace the motors years ago. Seems better than the OEM.<br />Note: when transferring the rubber seal and plastic like ring, if part of the ring does not fit into the plugged outlet hole do not try to drill a larger hole or the plug will come out. Better to trim the plastic like ring. I had to get set screw to plug it up.
B000CRKOHK|1|The package said exact fit replacement.  The wiper provided was 10&#34; to replace the original equipment 12&#34;.  That is not right
B0076AKISQ|5|Be careful when applying, once it sticks it is stuck!  Fits nicely, and prevents scratches when loading and unloading.
B004ADR2RM|5|nice looking lamps
B0053XYUUK|5|Awesome
B00DSVMCT0|4|Good quality..for the price
B007YS12QW|5|Used this with children's booster seats and it works very well.
B007ZHZ7EK|5|got laid the moment i put them on
B002YKK234|4|Worked great. Has a decent chrome finish, but it lacks any markings to identify what it is used for.  I wrapped mine with vinyl tape and labeled it, so in ten years when I need it, I will know.
B0009OMYCO|5|as advertised--Well packaged --Very quick shipment! Thanks
B001I7EMN0|1|Covers the chrome<br />I returned the item
B00AXXEL5Y|5|Funct&#62;ns exactly as expected. Even more compact than I expected.
B000A8J97C|5|Fit my 2016 Tacoma perfect and took about 10 mintues to install.
B009DPT6YO|5|The mat is good quality and I expect it will last many years under all types of cargo.  The two piece design allows flexibility with easy access to the under deck storage.  It fits the 2011 RX350 perfectly.  It arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  I recommend this to anyone needing a protective mat for the trunk.
B00UA6NAGA|5|I love Gemini styff
B00B7MRCM4|4|Better than factory lighting.
B00HLW18T2|5|Very good lights and a good price
B008HACIIC|4|Well, if it was in color, gave codes for ABS, and massaged my feet I'd have given it five stars.
B00WVVIHCY|3|Very bright. Must be installed in the socket a specific way. If it does not turn on, pull it out and flip it around. The color is a shade more yellow than wanted.
B00BGJ0KEU|5|Top notch product!  Works great for Motorcycle Air ride!
B00U1PCLVK|5|As advertised. Functional, looks exactly as the one I previously had and blinks like a charm.
B002VVIR1A|5|Ok
B000C8ZA9Q|5|What a difference a new exhaust system made on my 2005 Grand Caravan.  I needed a new catalytic converter, and opted to replace the whole system in one move (especially since I am in New England and the components all rot out from the winter salt).<br /><br />I highly recommend having a local shop do the installation, as it is well worth the $$ to have the job done in an hour, and you still come out WAY ahead from having the local muffler shop sell you the material and labor.
B006GJKIVU|5|Kung of the hammers approved. Work awesom.
B000UK9DA8|5|Nice flag
B00CPE694U|5|Very fun and loud
B006A6JLLC|5|Works great for homemade corn hole set.
B000BYB2WA|5|Excellent product.
B0075XHDHI|3|Never can flare straight. Buy one with the black hardened flare screw.
B00UYEAC96|5|The 9007 Kit works great. I have compared this kit with my original halogen 9007, this LED kit produce more bright and far compared with the OEM 9007 light bulbs. Good replace your OEM yellow halogen headlight.
B000I1JXJ0|5|Worked great on an antique fire truck.  The job would have been much more difficult without this tool.
B00VXYR3UC|5|In my opinion this is the best oil in all categories, provides tangible fuel economy, engine wear, Subaru  forester 2013 stopped eating oil!!!
B000TRBOK4|4|Good quality. Fits well in the small apartment sink.
B00GLL2VR2|5|It was easy to install and it heats up the water perfectly.
B00F22M5PO|5|Bought for my husband for Father's day and he loved it! Very cool distressed look!
B007EA6R0Q|4|Great construction and great for adult bikes....kids's bikes; not so much. I had to turn my child's 16 in. upside down and in between two other bikes to secure it well.
B00BGZ1WWS|5|Great products
B00LBA6O5I|5|A+
B006ZGLREG|4|good part long lasting for the money
B00E9F1KHE|5|After trying generic sunshades, I decided to get a custom fit shade and it fits perfectly.  The difference in temperature inside the car is dramatic.<br />Very well made, this should last the lifetime of the car.
B00J4QFK38|4|My Daughter-in-law and Son vacation in Hawaii 2 times per year.  I thought that the Hello Kitty would be a nice gift.  She loves it!!!!!!
B000GV8UTQ|5|they had all the hard ware  and fit like a glove
B00VSDZAXK|5|Perfect and looks awesome on my tinted truck rear window.
B00D4F1278|5|Aweson great lusk
B00SK12X5Q|3|It's better than the original one that came on the bike, but I think you could get just as good of results with a lot less expensive wind shield, was not  impressed.
B00UCAQR6O|1|They are not side specific, so they work on one side and you have to change locations to the other side. Also, the viewable area of the 'blind spot' is extremely small due to it's narrowness. Even tried to remount vertically but was even worse. Just not a good design.
B005MZUQ0M|2|I like the magnet and it was as advertised but it melted onto my car. I would not suggested putting this on anything valuable that may have to sit in the sun.
B008KVSFC6|3|doesn't fit all Mazdas. so i ended up giving it to a friend. but delrin doesn't get near as hot so its a good shift knob if you live somewhere with a lot of sun.
B00FEZM99Q|5|After 6 months so far so good, no rust or anything
B00NVSENRE|4|nice
B001UFRWHI|5|The kit installed quickly and easily on my 2008 ram 1500 4X4. The only problem I ran into was, one u-bolt interfered with my tailpipe. On the bright side the truck rides firm without giving a stink bug look and best of all, there is very little rear sag while towing my 5000lbs camper-trailer.
B0073W8TI8|2|My lights stop working bulbs are good I think the box die early any warranty?
B0009IBJBM|5|I kept hearing from my Dad that he loved my uncle's old battery charger that he was constantly borrowing.  I heard this from him on multiple occasions so I asked my uncle the model number.  I was pleasantly surprised it was a Schumacher and found they still made it after all these years.  I ordered him one as a present and he uses it all the time since its small and easy to move around.
B003JIMN0U|4|This programmer has worked just great so far with my 2014 GMC Sierra! It seems to have improved mileage by a little and definately notice a change in shifting and the throttle response!  No issues so far with the programmer! I like it quite a bit but even for such a low price I'm not sure how worth it a programmer is for me but excellent product all around!
B00D96TWC4|3|The screw caps were too small. I kept the item as the rest was satisfactory but it was a shame about the screw caps
B000EON01I|5|I looked at a lot of covers before deciding to purchase this one. I asked around at a few truck accessory dealers regarding pricing as well.<br /><br />Installation: I am not a mechanic, or a technical person at all. In fact, I work at a desk full time where the most work I do with my hands is punch keys on my computer. That said, I was able to install this cover by myself, in only about an hour. I will say that having a second set of hands would be extremely helpful when attaching the side rails to the truck bed, but it is certainly possible to do it alone in a reasonably short amount of time.<br /><br />Use: The cover operates exactly as described. The latches and the velcro hold the cover solidly in place when in transit, but yet it is extremely easy to roll out of the way when it's time to haul something. The adjustments were, at least for me, a little tough to figure out exactly how tight to set it for at first, but with a little patience it's pretty straight forward to get it dialed in just right.<br /><br />Style: I suppose this is opinion only, but I love the look this adds to the truck! It is very sleek, and with the low profile, doesn't stand out as being out of the norm.<br /><br />Durability: I've had the cover for several months now, and it still looks and functions exactly as it should despite being rolled and unrolled dozens and dozens of times. It seems to be very well made and has stood up to everything that's been thrown at it thus far.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anybody looking for an economical solution to cover their truck bed!
B00CHDHFR4|4|some holes doesn't match. so you will think about it.
B001DH81N2|4|good quality,, fits perfect.. saved my day.
B000HBIAGS|5|Works well

B003VAXC4M|4|Worked fine..
B001BB4LBG|5|For a inexpensive cover it fits well
B001CSA61W|5|Perfect fit and well constructed.
B001U6DMSK|2|I couldn't use it on my back seat, I checked all the specifications before I ordered, but I decided to keep it because it fit ok on the front seats, but so far the material is good and once you sit it won't ride up
B006XG71Z2|5|Arrived on time, excellent product, have not yet fitted them i am sure they will suit my needs. Peter C.
B0085G9P84|1|I've had it about a month and bulbs already blown out in parts. Not happy with it.

B00BT1CFE8|5|Great product! works great in my 2001 Corvette
B000J15TBU|5|Great product at a great price. Works great in my 2003 Pilot.
B002R0YOMG|5|it is good, thanks
B0002Z9QO4|5|Love it came quick and used it for a camping trip right away ! great quality and a lot thicker and tougher than other onesi have used and tried before . Great size  , just make sure you place it on your roof first and load it from the side or back since it would be to heavy and hard to do otherwise. Packed a lot of gear in and left the top part for softer stuff ( blankets , coats  tarps and air mattress`s , seen people have sharp and awkward hard hardware pushing the limit on there bag only asking for a rip or zipper tear !  Great strong zipper and thick large canvas area to load lots ! I have had 3 before and looked at 4 or 5 more ( from other campers and friends) and this is your best bang for your buck !!!!
B004I5TOJQ|5|great item A++++

B0055FDSJA|5|Comes in handy. Saved my clutch when bike fwll over.
B00J2GK5I0|4|This cover is nice, I have a Yamaha Stryker and it fits well. I use this to cover when my bike is sitting in the garage so it doesn't collect a lot of dust. For Stryker owner make sure to purchase the bigger size.
B004GC90SG|5|Perfect fit!! Love it!!
B000VKRQH4|5|Will order again
B00INCCN9S|5|Hubby is very happy with the purchase I made for him. :)<br /><br />Thank you
B00J0ABS5M|5|Works on f150 2014
B00B2YHHCW|4|I bought these items to replace the burnt out bulb in my camper refrigerator.  They were inexpensive and work well.
B00H6ETIWY|5|These work great.  Installed on Can AM.  Slope of roll cage makes passenger side hard for driver to use so I have adjusted it for passenger.
B000UVGK5I|5|Fits my 2012 Highlander perfectly!
B002ZWON2C|5|Awesome jacket. Yes it runs a little small so just order a size or two bigger. Zip out liner is a nice feature. And armor pads are a great touch but not to big and bulky. It rained on me the first day I had this jacket and stayed dry and warm! Awesome product highly recommended
B00IEYDZTC|5|Perfect
B00I8SHGHG|5|This is a must buy if you want mean sounding bike.
B008JP1TL2|5|Fit perfectly!
B0039LDF4A|5|This saved me a bunch of money and time
B00C873Y60|5|Good value
B00KI2QUSQ|3|cns egr delete kit.  not labled as cns and plugs are not blue anodized. no silicon.  no instructions.  otherwise everything fits as it is supposed to.
B00RW3QXUO|5|look great love them
B000CP8N52|5|Worked great!
B008G1X6X8|3|Very good
B00IZIBJ04|5|This is the stuff to use on the Time Sert thread inserts.
B003VAYRNM|5|Fits just like stated.
B000F0QWVG|5|Extremely pleased with this purchase. Good shipping/delivery time and a really great product. Fits perfectly in my '06 LR3. Thank you
B00KNBD3XW|4|The jury is still out on this one . I replace it because the  original head cracked where the hose went on and leaked .
B00COYZKS2|3|Seem to vibrate a little no matter how tight I tighten the bolts.  Looks great though!
B002UC1AYQ|2|It was the part I needed and was fairly easy to install. But it is flimsy and cheaply made and I have every expectation of having to replace it in the future.
B004XESO9I|5|GR8 item THX
B00851QMVM|5|Have only used it on four nights, but so far..it works just fine. Plenty bright for the outdoor patio light by itself.  ...and when I use rope lights on the awning; between the two, I've got lots 'o light.
B00141781I|5|Great sticker with good detail.
B001QIUGVI|5|great item A++++
B000C9HAOI|5|Makes my E300 mercedes stop quick and quietly

B00SX9U1FY|5|Fit perfect. Arrived quickly. Includes all the correct fittings. Installed on a 96 4x4 s10 blazer 4.3.
B00R6PZDMM|5|Exactly as described and pictured
B00JFALCVW|5|Work great easy to install
B00NOKPPK8|5|I installed this light on my War Eagle (duck boat) and it is exactly what I wanted. The mounting hardware that is included is great if you are able to use bolts and reach the hardware on both sides.<br />If you are mounting this to a boat, be prepared to improvise. I used stainless marine self tapping screws because I was not able to reach under the bow to tighten the bolts down. Now, the light is secure and isn't going anywhere.
B011Q18D14|5|This works very effectively. Well worth the price.
B005BN46TM|3|A little sparse; but OK for the price.
B0083KIWHW|5|Everything arrived well<br /> I am a customer and I will continue buying amazon in Mexico and the United States<br /> thank you
B001KOIZZ2|5|Sounds great, love my pipe.
B00GS9ENAK|5|Got rid of nasty smell in the car. Good quality!
B007W7Q8ZK|5|Worked well
B0041Q1GAM|5|Looks great on my motorcycle!!
B00VS7FZIG|5|The sticker is perfect.  I was hoping that it was a little bigger but that's ok. It is the ONLY sticker that will be on my vehicle. !!!
B00S09T8M4|5|Pretty neat little product here. We used it once so far and it definitely helps get the job done! My car is clean! The seller made sure the package was new and got to our home without damage. I recommend both the product and the seller.
B0036IA6JI|4|It workdd
B00B2KBCY0|5|These lights are much brighter than I thoight they would be. I have 80w low beams and these lights wash out the low beams, great for spotting wildlife at night to avoid collisions.
B0012BL8LG|5|Used this with a Wagan 2577 Personal Fridge and it worked like a charm for &#34;lite camping&#34;.
B00E0NSL54|5|Very good
B00B1ENJ7K|5|Cheap and they look great on my car!
B005KDOAP8|5|nice
B00U6G3HDU|5|The tint was better than expected. I got it on time. With no scratches. I only bought it for the clear part of my taillights. I didn't wrap the whole light. It's a light tint. If I needed more I'd buy again.
B005SUU2HS|5|Had an issue with tool itself, rectified by vendor. Good overall
B00ENKH2BI|5|Amazing!!! I dropped the new spindles off at the shop, they installed them easily and that was that! My brake lines had to be readjusted because of the lift, but it wasn't a problem. Be careful with anything more than 3&#34;. My truck looks younger, sexier, and I have bigger tires under there. Thank you!!
B000BQOV80|3|So am am am an extang human.  Like them on small trucks and big alike.  This one tho, does not come to the edge of the bed.  It's about 2&#34; off on both sides.  I suppose it does provide protection of bed contents, I'd just like to see it better fitted to the bedFrame.<br /><br />I like the trifold, the ease of placement/removal.  I like the way it secures attatches.
B00029WRKU|3|Bought these mirrors for my 2015 Ford F150 - had the CIPA slide on mirror on previous tow vehicle. Mirrors worked loose twice in a four hour haul. Had to stop and retighen. Wished CIPA made a custom mirror for new truck that is a much better system
B00RYPBHNI|5|Exactly how I pictured it, great quality. I have it on my car window, no stick problems at all!
B000HAEPAO|3|will work for lite gobs
B004OK5SS6|5|Best deal available !
B007BZHUFU|5|Very comfortable and functional.  It also doesn't make me look like a mushroom!  The drop down visor and the adjustable head band are very nice features.
B000G3MQVW|5|Really looks great
B0086JI9AU|3|Not the color represented in the photo.  They were more of a blue/grey instead of the regular handicap blue.
B002N2OMUW|5|Installed so easy. less than 5 minutes to install.
B00X9CWJ5K|1|Order was not fully full filled
B008B5X5GC|5|worked great
B00LAAVK76|5|1/4th cost of local suppliers.....Did the same job.....go figure
B00MB0F9DA|3|Kind of small.  Very see through so the colors are very light.  Except the black of course.
B005Z28IZC|5|Fabuloso!
B005H5XTX8|5|good
B00A3XYV3G|4|It was well worth the price!
B00S74AQN2|1|Doesn't even fit on my 2015 jeep wrangler...waste of money
B00DYSDSBI|2|Pretty &#34;streaky&#34;.  I had hoped for better quality...
B00KTIUG5C|5|Feel nice and solid.<br />These remotes were way easier to program than I thought. Unlock the car, keep driver's door open, cycle key off to run (not engaging the starter) 8 times very quickly, on the 8th time leave in run position, door locks will lock and unlock automatically, press a button on the remote, the doors locks will cycle again, press a button on the second remote, doors locks cycle again, turn the key off, you are done.  The only trick is you have to program them both  in the same go.  If you do one and then repeat the whole process on the second, then the first becomes &#34;unprogrammed&#34;
B00VJQ799O|4|Bar feels solid.  Light output is outstanding.  I was planning on giving 5 stars, but after some heavy thunderstorms all day yesterday and this morning, there was some condensation build up.  For the amount of rain we got, I was surprised but how little condensation there was yet there still was condensation... hence 4 stars and not 5.  Once the temperature and humidity rose, it cleared right up.  For the price I'm happy with it.
B000CODPFG|5|Perfect
B00BTSDLKI|3|Need a holder like at the back portion,so the plate won't be moving and noisy. The front design is excellent.
B004I12MXK|5|WAS GREAT
B0012ZEZ8A|5|Lots of great stuff!
B00LO0M918|5|excellent product
B000VJR102|5|I was recommended this brand for my 2011 Kawasaki ninja 250 R (Carb Engine). Although I am a new rider, I truly didn't notice much of a difference in anything from the old oil to this brand, which the bike rode 3,000 miles before this oil change (I know, crazy) but that might just be because I'm a newbie and can't really tell. Some people say the engine rides smoother or the clutch catches a little better using this brand, (I truly didn't notice anything) no complaints though, 5 stars it is!
B00JINPJD8|5|Fits the std home depot bucket, works as expected
B005MVB4RU|3|Get on ebay and buy a snap on 3050 and be done for the same price but wayyyyyyyyyyy better tool.
B00S9VEA5I|5|Looks exactly as pictured!
B000CO7QLK|5|no problems did the job and had instructions. thanks!
B00KCXMCTM|5|fast shipping, good product
B00LIC63UU|3|Drove 4,000 miles with these on my travel trailer in July. At random, it would lose signal with any given sensor. Even when the modal was placed in the back seat and rear windows. I love the device overall, but cannot live with random signal loss on a short trailer such as mine. A booster is needed I guess, but for the short distance I just could not swallow that fact.
B0043DSGBA|5|Works great and did exactly what I needed them to do highly recomend theses to anyone
B00CPGQ1GO|3|Biggest i thought,  you can not even lift the kickstand normally,  i think this pad should b smaller than now.
B00QF0SPP6|2|It was cheap and hollow and filled with some kind of white foam with adhesive..it's not 3m...I added additional adhesive...hope it stays on.  You get what you pay for. I Should have got the Nissan part.
B002PGRJN8|5|Nice!
B00CAY4TSI|5|Works like its supposed too!
B009NOZ4SC|5|a great yellowish white colour and very bright.
B0068G22M4|5|Fit in my Suzuki Quadrunner LT230GE as expected and works great. No issues at all with the product or the transaction.
B0069ARUKI|5|This product is very well made.  It's heavy duty and easy to use.  Even the instructions were easy to understand.  The principle is simple:  slots along the inside tube engage a spring loaded key on the other tube, holding the assembly at the desired width.  Once in place, a locking pin slides into place, ensuring the bar doesn't collapse, what with the bounces and bumps of the road.  Turning the outer tube further extends the threaded feet into the pickup's sidewall, tightening the fit.  Rubber feet insure damage is not done to the truck bed.  Simple, well made and affordable.  What's not to like?
B007H2Q07G|5|Very comfortable chairs
B00DR67P9I|5|The waterproofing for this has been phenomenal, I installed this and synced them as reversed light when backing up. Boy these things shine really bright for the size that they are. I'm thinking about buying a second pair already
B001COAS78|5|Late 2002 ML320 -  170,000 miles - If your ML will not start and just goes through the 5-6seconds cranking cycle w/o starting - seems like no gas or no spark, probably CPS.  find U-tube video to make it easy.  Need 8 mm torex socket and 9&#34; socket extension.  The MBZ dealer said &#34;have it towed in&#34; well that is 250 miles one way!  Napa could order part for $95.  Got this overnight.  Started immediately after replacement.  Had check engine light for first 25 miles then it went out.  Good to go!  Have 4 MBZ 3 out of 4 have experienced CPS failure.  Buy one and carry in your car with right wrench so you won't be stranded.
B00D9C2CDO|5|It worked great. I was a little worried because I didn't have crossbars on my rack but I didn't have any problems with it loosening or moving
B000EALHH6|5|fantastic!!! cleans EVERYTHING well!!
B000Q7HBOU|5|Excellent product, it works perfectly.
B009ES3F0Q|5|Great lights especially for the price. I have no complaints - they are very bright and light up the work area on my tractor just like I wanted them to. The Stainless Steel hardware is a nice bonus too.
B00MJ7U0FC|1|The vinyl inside the tube was peeling and wrinkled.
B00EAJY5TO|5|great oil filter cheaper than the store
B00LT2G95S|5|I am very pleased with my purchase. I received my life vests 2 days after ordering, just in time to take my new jet ski out! Both vests are very high quality and an excellent value at just under $100.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Thx
B00BKNW6WQ|5|Fit like a glove
B000F8ERBU|5|I was in need of a replacement radiator to replace the stock 1&#34; core radiator on my 2004 Dakota . After doing some research I learned that I should have a radiator with a 1 1/2&#34; for towing a travel trailer that I would be towing in just a few days.. After reading all the reviews of this radiator arriving not as described I initially decided against ordering it. I ordered a &#34;severe duty&#34; radiator from a Dodge dealer...I learned that the OEM &#34;severe duty&#34; radiators are hard to locate and usually require a 5 day wait. I was lucky enough to find one readily available...but it had a huge bow in it so I decided to return it.  I was out of options so I ordered the Valeo 732622 radiator from Amazon and hoped for the best,,,Worst case scenario was the radiator would be too thin and I would need to cancel the camping trip. The radiator arrived in two days.and when I opened it I was pleased that it was a full 1 9/16&#34; thick with two rows just as advertised! I installed it today and all fit perfectly,
B00QSNW81C|1|16,500 not 16,5000 lol
B0006SU3QW|5|Awesome
B00KTJ1FKQ|5|Everything worked. 1 minute programming. Excellent
B000HS1356|5|I've had this product for over a year and it has held up wonderfully. It IS waterproof and it does a great job keeping my motorcycle safe from the elements while it sits outside. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. It only includes one loop for a security/locking cable so I run a six foot bike lock through the pockets located on the front side by the wheel, through the brake discs, and then loop them back around and lock the cable on top of the buckle that connects the cover on the bottom. Easy to do and it ensures the cover won't get stolen though it won't prevent someone from lifting the cover up from the back of the bike and taking it almost all of the way off.
B006ZDY2W8|5|Little bing makes big difference
B001FLOP0Y|5|Works fine.  Thanks!
B0019BSGTQ|5|To cool. Love it.
B00HEEXJ9O|5|This fitted my rsx 03 base. Acura wanted a couple hundred to fix it this only cost me around 50 and an hour to replace it.
B00HZH66ZY|5|total transformed my jeeps motor into a beast and gave me better gas mileage to. best thing I ever did for my 2013 Rubicon
B00D1CQVIY|5|Good wiring harness
B00K5VNF2E|2|worked great
B000BQY6LW|5|very well made lights. put them on my compact tractor. worked great A+A+A+
B00HVHHJZ4|5|I bought this because I had a problem with my alarm going off when I sat in the car (2009 Maxima) with the key in my pocket. It would even happen if I was inside the house, and sat down with the key in my pocket. This fob cover provides enough space between the buttons, and ME to keep these inadvertent button pushes from happening.
B006VENTAM|5|They worked great for the once a year they are used for Hawaii safety inspection on my lifted jeep.
B00192JFYA|5|Great product. Holds up well.
B000C57L7I|5|A great deal on top quality product.  Extremely easy to install on my 2005 Grand Caravan and now it rides better than ever!
B00SD2KJJ4|1|Candles are brighter than these things.  The wording in the title is misleading, there is no way these could ever be used as headlights and they are not super bright.  Super dim!
B00WAOS7YA|2|djd not fit the best
B00CULEPDA|1|Stuck in the middle all the time.how do you reset it?
B005EMOQ6I|3|Just as expected.
B0060LTPM2|5|Fast shipping, was what I needed to replace old headlamp units
B00JPBED30|3|Was what I expected. Great quality just had to buy more to make it work for me.
B00JIHC36K|1|Bright but one led blinks after 15 mins junk
B000WSPV0E|3|Not the quality of vinyl I was expecting but was satisfied
B00J8D31OC|2|one broke right away
B003SS62PS|3|Cheap fan works and blows air! Stops working or breaks?...pitch it for 12 bucks!
B00OYADE6Y|1|Beware of seller. I ordered two sets and only received one. Seller doesn't seem to care. Lights work just fine. No instructions so good luck and hope you don't need anything from seller because once he has your money he could care less if you actually receive the product.
B00OO181NO|5|Perfect fit for my 2000 ML320,<br />Very happy !<br />Thank you !
B009UYO3D2|5|looks great , was easy to install
B000NBVFN2|5|does the job, good for the money
B00L7FC9JW|1|Not really user friendly.. Hard to get back into original packaging after use. Doesn't fit well on the Hummer
B007TNLWM6|5|Perfect
B004WJPN2A|5|Good Stuff. Worked well.
B000HBNX38|4|It was much thicker than I expected. It did turn the rust black though.
B006YGFF4K|3|They look nice but were too small to fit the seats in a YJ.
B00C1O3QCM|2|Look cool but they don't smell. You're basically just buying them for looks.
B004C1Z508|4|Shipping was slow. Tinted lenses. Ok value.
B010ADEGFG|5|I needed a new shroud because mine had cracked....this new headlight shroud is very strong and nice....fit perfect on my jonway 50cc...and arrived quickly! !
B00GSAUHB8|1|How disappointing. This sun shade broke after a week, the wire broke out of the side. It was almost impossible to get back into it's storage bag after the second time using it. Avoid this and find one better made!
B00DD7Z2LY|5|Got this for my daughter who will be starting kindergarten. It arrived weeks sooner than expected. The quality far exceeded my expectations. It is nicely lined and had a bunch of pockets and zipper compartments. Large enough for school folders. Recommend using scotch guard to protect the canvas as the colors are light
B00RL43BXG|3|It's not that bright as I was expected
B000CPI5Z0|5|Works great I can notice a difference after one use
B006H05DSG|5|Perfect!
B009WDX1NE|5|Needed a replacement for one lost on last trip, same holder. I like it because it is light weight, easy to remove and doesn't retain moisture.  I like that it wont fill up with condensation.  We use it on our Victory Cross country
B004YD9LWC|5|Absolutely love this keychain!  Really well made with good detailing.
B005R4KXUG|4|Nice lights look good Took a couple hours of playing with trying different connections and 3 burnt fuses before I figured it out and they work great now no directions on my 03 silverado I had to leave the middle wire on the light not plugged in and just the other three but when you plug in the the connector match the black grounds on both the small connector wire you might have to unplug it and flip it around to get the polarity right hopefully this helps someone there was no videos to help anyone out can be frustrating !
B000C8PD9I|5|heated it with MAP gas, cooled the wheel and it dropped right on.
B004XRAOX4|5|Love it!
B00MRV83G8|5|In a 2008 Sequoia, I've replaced all 4 door bulbs, all the dome light bulbs, and the license-plate bulbs with these.  Definitely has a blue tint, but looks great with the grey interior.  I put these in a few months ago and they've worked perfectly.  You might have to slightly bend the contact wire or flip the bulb if the bulb doesn't come on when you first seat it.  The door bulbs were the hardest to do because of the plastic housing, but be patient and they'll fit.  Hint for the door bulbs on the Sequoia, fit the raised LED on the top of the bulb into the round hole in the clear housing--then you won't feel like you're cramming the bulbs in.
B000FBUOAA|4|worked good
B007EFUTQY|5|Amazing quality, fit and finish.  Smoke is very light but no more squinting during sunny days!  No more warped plastic window from the stock shield in front of your nose!
B006OQ35GU|5|Never in my life have I ever seen such a marvel of modern engineering. Had I know about this earlier, I would have bought a travel trailer just so I could use this. Highly recommended. Guaranteed to complete you.
B000CPC8Y4|5|got when promised and fit on our truck
B00ZC20NUS|5|I like it because it is small and easy to use. The multiple tools on it come in handy in the most unfortunate situations.
B000HBNT1O|5|Great
B00B6QET2M|5|Looks factory installef. The wife loved it. Much cheaper then what the dealer wanted. Instructions were easy to follow, they give you mounting templates to tape to the trunk lid. Just take your time and measure, measure, measure. Cause once you drill that first hole your committed. It's been on the car now for about 5 months. Been thru many car washes and no leaks, no fading so far. Only thing I can say is don't slam the trunk lid, try and support the wing with one hand while closing the lid with the other. Less likely to weaken the metal at the mounting locations over time.
B00RV46YBC|2|I've purchased switchback LEDs before and had a bad experience so I was hesitant on purchasing these but I'm glad I did! These bulbs are beautiful and work exactly as described. So much so that I ordered a second pair for my other car. I can promise you you won't be disappointed in these bulbs. The bulb does take a second to go from Amber to white but honestly that should not dictate whether you buy these or not. You have to be really anal if the very slight delay bothers you. White to Amber there is no delay. I am very pleased and will do business again.  EDIT: So a couple days after I reviewed this product, one of the lights would stay orange when activating the turn signal. I requested a replacement be shipped and it was shipped ONE DAY. Excellent! Customer service is great. My replacement bulb, however, will sometimes not come on for whatever reason. It's really frustrating that I paid $30 for these bulbs for 3 of them to have something go wrong. When they do work though, they look amazing. But with the trouble I've had and how expensive these are to break so easy, I had to bring my rating from 5 stars to 2.
B001D20X4W|5|Cleans the air
B00BJ9J7V4|4|Smells great just wish it lasted longer
B00HFLGZKQ|5|Excellent !! this is just what I needed
B0002SQU9K|3|A little small for trucks, does great on my car calipers though.
B00IUSGHCO|5|It took longer to gather the tools than it did to install the light.  It looks great and with the relay it works great. The plate bracket is also top notch. Thanks.
B00KN0MHLW|5|Heavy-duty.
B00KQTH95E|5|So easy to install.
B000SHYXJE|5|Easy install and good price.
B007IPBEGY|1|Not very good.
B001RS6PJY|5|Item works flawlessly & is heavy duty, product is as advertised with fast shipping! A must need when powering big boy audio systems!!! Fast shipping! Awesome product, theses are boss for big boy systems! I'm powering 4 15 L7s, 2 mech man alternators big four and 2 SSL 5k.1 amps. This is a must product!
B00N5ZVOUC|5|Luv the key case protector ordered two colors.
B004VLPZNG|5|Worked great. Problem solved and a lot cheaper than my local auto shops.
B008F91ME6|3|I bought this product for my dinghy. I dropped the front Nav light in the water by mistake for 2 seconds and the interior started to rust within 2 days. The back light never touched the water but has signs of rust inside now, a month later. It's an okay quality product.
B00792IU7W|4|fit as original
B000S2SHZK|5|Just the part I needed for my Tahoe. It was winter time and no matter what I did I could not get Hot  air to come out of the rear vents. Only thing I found was after installing the part I did not get an immediate reaction. I tried all the different things it says online to get the immediate action of hot air. I was almost ready to send it back when after driving it for an hour all of a suddenly the rear started to respond to the heat I had it on
B001CI8DVC|5|Product, service and shipping was exactly as expected
B0076HUGVS|4|it work
B004O9WC18|5|good product, works well.
B00IO8IY7Q|5|Good product, cheaper and workable
B00080QHMM|3|I want accuracy!<br /> I tested 4 of  better quality tire pressure gauges including this one, Tektons #5941, Victor 100psi gauge with hose and my cars own digital gauge.<br />I chose one of my tires to test the readings on each gauge.<br />The Tekton, Victor and my car all had the same reading of 35 psi which is correct for my car.. This Accutire MS-4021B gave a reading of 34.5psi. Obviously showing a reading of a half-pound less.<br />I will go with the three matched readings as being the correct measurement.<br />Therefore, although good enough, I think this Accutire gauge would not be my first choice.
B0012INT98|5|This product worked great we went over 1000 miles with this strapped to the top of our van. Had no incidents with tears or rips. It even kept all of our stuff dry. It can hold 3 very big suitcases and still have plenty of room...
B00FDQPCR2|5|Great light!  Ordering two more!
B00AN5RFZA|5|Installed like any other brake and rotor.  The break in procedure was interesting.  Find a large parking lot and have fun power stopping.  Been on 2 weeks now and so far they are working well.  Of course time will tell.
B00BCRMA9Y|5|Good
B00II5YADC|4|These work great on the car or on windows!
B00CJ0KS88|3|made a little bulky, but still do what they are designed to do.
B00JDPRBQO|5|Quick delivery and really made the bike look new again.
B004TBXXDC|1|Reserve of Substitution of Bad Quality and to save money the cheap thing it leaves expensive for not buying original parts
B0055P5MEO|4|Really cool headlights, the only thing that disappointed me is they are not black on the inside, its more of a dark chrome and during the day the are really bright.
B0016I6CCA|4|As advertised
B004RCOU7Q|4|Sway control worked well . I also installed the rear sway control by Road Master and install air lifts to front .
B00GQBFQVU|5|Outstanding quality and color match for my pearl white Ford Escape!  Very pleased!  Can't find a better price either!
B0071I2WZ0|5|Came in great condition and as expected. Fit the car model (2007 Hyundai Sonata) perfectly.
B00L4TF32G|5|Beats ArmourAll hands down!
B000GV4NJM|1|Doesn't fit s&S 96 properly, and doesn't come with hardware. 2 thumbs down
B00UW2LN0C|5|awesome fit
B00L84EKI0|5|This product is a life saver.  Dealer torqued the old plastic housing too tight and cracked it, got a replacement made of aluminum and this fits perfectly on it for easy oil changes...finally.
B002SSGAQU|3|The angle that the spring is connected at is such that I don't see how the spring can work in a usefull manner.  I'm not sure that it is any better then just an ordinary tie down using turnbuckles.
B00XQ02NLU|4|Excellent color match easy to use.
B006YCK2F6|1|I got the wrong part
B00MQ19A20|2|Not a perfect match it says it is
B00D6YF5UC|1|I was disappointed with this product.  It did not fit at all.  I returned it.
B003UHX5WU|5|Great fit and function!  Definitely keeps the car cooler. Is a bit awkward to handle when rolling up, but worth the effort.
B005M16QY6|5|When I first put these on I was extremely skeptical that they would stay on when peddling a bike for downhill and taking jumps/drops. To my surprise they stay on very very well and do not move. They are comfortable and allow for a lot of movement. I would recommend them to anyone who needs knee/shin protection while biking. These have saved my shins and knees a group of times.
B000N37BCO|1|Leaks grease out when stored.  So when you need it it's empty.
B00K35VI4O|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B004I0MOIY|5|Fit like a glove!
B000ARPVOI|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B004VJOV2Y|4|Good transaction, timely delivery, and exactly what I needed.<br />excellent
B00V30J86I|4|Great
B0014M1XFO|3|I like it the first 3 years, but now it rusted. I think I will invest in plastic.
B0007WXJDQ|5|perfect
B004A2IFII|5|OEM quality
B00NEL7BWM|5|this made my AC even more powerful!
B006EGAIII|5|They were the right price and exactly what I needed as I have a low profile vehicle,they will come in handy
B000BRQ0TW|1|put it at the bottom of some indoor pots and they all leak. :(
B002YI969C|5|The lens is great but resent having to buy it separate from the light!
B001TIV1KA|3|not sure how good it is, but its not helping my RV black water holding tank reading sender
B002BHWZFI|5|One of the few things I want to give 10 or 20 or 30++ STARS<br />I use this on every lens, or optics I use cameras, magnifiing glass, eye glasses, touchscreen phones, hand held devices with display ..........<br />I have used for years I love it and I take friends glasses and use this and then they eather buy some or ask me to clean their glasses every few days lol<br />I tell them to buy some it great
B000N2WAVC|5|Quick delivery, easy install for a 1968 Dodge D100 pickup with a slant six engine. Maybe 45 min of work. Didn't even need to adjust my timing. Quicker start, smoother idle, and more power on acceleration.
B0101A0C38|5|So true! More comments on this bumper sticker then any other I have on truck.
B004AGEWPE|5|exceeded my expectations will purchase these again for any of my cars
B00S4HFNXK|5|We have two Sea Doos (the largest size) and these bumpers are really nice for use when visiting someone else's dock.  They're compact to stow, are a very thick and dense foam, and stay put when in use.  In fact, that's one of my favorite features of these - typical round bumpers roll back and forth if the watercraft is not tied super close/tight to the dock.  These flat bumpers stay in place and make it much easier to ensure that your boat isn't going to get beat up when those big wakes come.<br />We are very pleased with these and recommend them without hesitation!
B008BLPMOO|2|only good for small cars. Not long enough for the hood.
B001AVB78W|5|works great
B00KRQQXDU|1|Sadly I ordered two of these on two different occasions and neither of them has working glue... the glue is old and stuck to the paper so the sticker will not stick to anything.  I thought because it was only $3.99 no big deal to order a second one but it was bad too.
B000CB0U7U|5|Arrived ahead of schedule and fit my 95 MPV 3.0 perfectly.
B000QGZXCS|5|nevr-dull all that has to be said. used it in the navy still use it today.
B002G248L2|5|Everything arrived well<br /> I am a customer and I will continue buying amazon in Mexico and the United States<br /> thank you
B00GSAUHB8|5|A little oversized--my bad for not checking the dimensions-- but I can definitely tell the difference in temperature! I live in San Diego, CA, own a Subaru Forester with tinted windows and I always leave my windows slightly cracked, yet my steering wheel would burn my hands and the general internal temperature of the vehicle was grossly hot. I started using this shield and, I assure you, it keeps your vehicle much cooler.<br /><br />I had returned the original one given because it came broken but they were quick to replace it and provide a shipping label for the defective one, so great customer service.
B00KTHZ8CY|5|Other than not having a logo on the back side of the key, the case fit perfectly.  just need to have the key cut.
B0002JMIEK|5|I have used Liquid glass for years.  It is easy to apply and you get a superb lasting shine.
B0041DZ48K|5|Love this look!
B003ZWL24S|3|Quick easy install for $11 dollars (Youtube helps with the install). OEM handle would have cost $25-40 bucks from the Dealer or &#34;estore.honda&#34; in the correct color.<br />BLACK HANDLE FIT my 2000 HONDA ACCORD LEFT REAR DOOR.<br />I will update in 6-12 months IF it fails/breaks<br /><br />Only 1 Negative is that it didn't match the color of the car
B004LGHPQ6|5|These fixed the miss-fire problem on my 2008 Honda Fit!  Should have got them a couple years ago.
B004INCV3Y|4|When it arrived the box looked pretty bad. Opened it up and it looked to be undamaged. After I had it on I noticed a couple of light scratches. It was really easy to put on the 2014 Edge. All you do is remove 4 push pens holding on the rubber weatherstripping. You slide the defector between the rubber and the hood and line up the holes. I used the factory push pens and it worked great. It would be a 5 star review if it were scratch free. You would need to look hard to find the scratches, but I had rather start with no scratches. I took a 2 hour interstate drive the day after I put it on. I seemed to get less bugs on my windshield than before. I would buy it again, and would recommend to a friend.
B00H4Y4DEE|5|With a bad shoulder, it doesn't take much pressure for very long before the shoulder seat belt is bugging me. I tried the metal types and Forget It, they are way bulky and don't work at all. These plastic ones do the job and are light weight.
B003M4OAY8|5|This is durable and well built. Sent quickly.
B00H873X8E|5|A perfect fit to get rid of the back seat gap, which is about 6&#34; for stuff to fall it. it has a neat feature that follows the seat when it is retracted. Well made and worst the money. Cheaper that at he dealership which is $135.00. I wholly recommend it to anyone that has the proper vehicle. A simple install by placing two rods in the factory installed mount.
B000KINHN4|5|great fit for my 2013 Gmc sierra. Hopefully they hold up well. They are so easy to put on.  You could not possibly mount wrong.
B00U0UWQ2A|4|Very well made and looks great on my car. The metal ring for the keys started to scratch and turn silver very quickly but I bought this for the air Caps anyway.
B006OQ115C|2|It's does the job but it's cheaper at Walmart
B00LF94JHA|5|Perfect color match.  Easier to use than expected although I didn't smear it with my thumb I used a stiff piece of paper to squeegee it into the chips.  I highly recommend.
B004YTOZ90|5|Not my first use of this product. As always fit is excellent and it serves well to protect my cars mats
B001HATY36|5|nice locks
B00ZG3T480|1|Came empty
B00A43KYA4|4|Color match and directions were good.
B008LTJ6IY|1|very cheap quality
B003HOWSYC|5|Every decal I have ordered is 100% great.
B00XNPAEOQ|4|It is a pretty good fit but it says half when shield it's more like one third doesn't come up half way so if you're kind of tall you still have wind in your face but other than that it does block most of the wind if you are short
B00MXRV9AI|2|Product works but received dirty from manufacturing - not use, and is not the best quality. I purchased it for necessity and the novelty factor but I wouldn't recommend it.
B00L3KDUD0|5|These wheel brushes work very well.  Much easier and faster to clean the various wheels I have on my cars.
B00063X7KG|5|the best there is!
B0034HWNDS|5|Best filter to get, holds more dirt and consistent quality.
B0010E00T6|5|Excellent product.... excellent transaction!!!
B002EBSLA4|5|Excellent filters for BMW k75S and good price point.
B00LEBLI82|5|Just what I was looking for.  Thanks.
B000CMH8SI|4|I installed these myself and they were not as hard to handle. Just be sure to do the tinting in a clean space.
B00B5UJ9HO|5|looks good on my truck.
B00EJOT6A8|2|don't waste your time on the factory fuel filter.  I ended up having to remove it and bought an AirDog instead.  Now my truck finally runs correctly. This product ins't necessarily bad but if you are getting air at the filter through the old plastic screw like i was, you may also be getting it from all the other seals like i was.  I could have done a rebuild for under $100 but Amazon sells AirDog's for under $500.  A good investment to me
B00FQEC65C|5|Thank you  for providing me with the perfect fix for my car. It fit like 'a glove' - job well done. I appreciate the opportunity to share what a wonderful service you provide.... Thanks again! Great product - exactly what I asked for!!!
B009R667NM|5|great
B009DJQP80|5|Great looking and nice fit
B00T2GT9L4|2|This thing is amazing!  Jump started a large SUV with no trouble at all!    UPDATE:  WITHIN A YEAR THE DEVICE STOPPED WORKING.  It wouldn't even charge a cell phone let alone jump a car.
B003GYV8A8|5|I read the description of this product and was intrigued.  Could it really pick up all the dirt and schmutz we accumulate on auto vents, and other hard-to-reach, hard-to-clean surfaces?  I think it CAN.  So far, I haven't made it out to the car -- I've been curious trying it on various things in the house.  For example, I have a swag of artificial apples, and I've never been sure if they were supposed to be matte-finished, or if there was embedded dust in them. (Regular cleaning had been inconclusive.)  Surprise!  It turns out some are shiny and some are matte -- that's what the manufacturer intended.  How nice to see the shiny ones shiny again.  There's something about the THOROUGHNESS of the cleaning that stands out.  It pulls dirt out that other cleaning techniques miss.  So I would say to use Cyber Clean not just on surfaces that are hard to reach, but on things you suspect need a DEEPER cleaning.  (Like the should-be-shiny apple.)  You'll likely find there is a layer of dirt hiding down in the micro crevices & pits.  No big deal in most cases -- dirt is a part of life -- but for those things that need to be super clean, this is a godsend.
B00II7S7BG|1|these didn't fit junk
B00QVTDV0K|5|Gasket sealed great where the factory one wouldn't. Great product!
B0048770KE|5|Great.
B00ONDM07G|5|Bolts to the dashboard! It's amazing. Sturdy as hell and looks great. I totally suggest this for any iPhone 6 Plus user because we all know there isn't really a safe place to put your phone aside from the mesh ouch located below the AC controls.
B002RYBS76|5|Received as expected, good paint
B000CJ2V1U|5|perfect
B0024NSMWY|1|Lasted five months before seal broke on the light. Since I was past the &#34;return period&#34;, seller won't provide a refund or any help.  I'm back to where I started + a lot of frustration.<br /><br />I would not buy again. I would buy higher quality and from a seller that stands behind their product more than a few, short months.
B00A7YUIO2|1|I orderded a 18&#34;  and received a 13&#34; Where is my 18&#34;?  Delores
B00LV8P9R4|4|ood value for the money.  That beug said, I found it very stiff and I am hoping that it softens up with use.  not real leather and made in Pakistan, although it has USA all over it...  oh well, what do you expect for the money, over all I am not dissatisfied...  just gonna have to work it
B001GQQTMK|5|nice kit
B00BQYCKE8|5|I use these towels to dry off my car and to wipe away Meguiar's Quick Detailer spray. They are a nice size at a great price.
B0006FK7YS|4|Works really well.  I like that it can extend and retract.  Could possible be too wide for some, but if you have a large open area this is the way to go.
B001UCB1C8|5|did the job for half of the price
B002GKYWG0|5|very good product for my 2003 dodge ram, used the screwless mounting brackets<br />and it worked great. trim went on perfect and looks great.
B009UYO3D2|5|Very easy to install and looks great.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Works great and comes in handy at difficult times
B000PL07J8|4|four stars because they are kinda small. i wanted a little bigger but this will work. keep in mind this is for small repair quarter size
B00LM02COO|5|Previously it had bought 2 caps of different brands and these soon broke . This is the best I bought, sorry but do the translation in Spanish
B00Q7A46DY|5|Great fit, easy to install. Love them, gonna see if they have a set for the car next.
B00K1N43R2|4|So I have a BMW convertible.  When it's hot outside and not too hot for the top down your back can get wet from the sweat.  Of course that's why you're even looking at this seat.  So here's my take on this seat:  It does NOT fit correctly on seats that have the seatbelts built in the actual seat.  It comes with a strap that's supposed to go OVER the seat.  Can't do that if you have a seatbelt set up like mine.  So I didn't use it.  Next thing is it comes with straps that are supposed to go around the headrest.  On my car, the headrest is mounted off to one side and not in the center.  So those straps wouldn't work either.  I ended up &#34;stuffing&#34; those top straps into the headrest.  It worked, but not the way this thing was designed.  Keep in mind this seat does not create cool air.  It takes whatever air you have circulating below your seat and pushes it into the seat.  It does help with the cooling of the seat back and bottom.  I will leave my A/C running even with the top down so the cool air is running under the seat.  Speaking of under the seat, if you have powered seats you need to make sure you have room for the air intake under there.  If not, you'll have the air intake sitting in the back floorboard.  I was pretty happy with this regardless of the strapping issues for the first couple months.  Then I realized I had a &#34;bulge&#34; right around the lumbar part of the seat.  I think some of the cushioning of the back part of the seat had come loose and moved down.  I couldn't get it to move back up.  So now there's a bulge in the seat.  Doesn't feel too bad since it's at the lumbar area.  One last thing: it comes with plenty of cord for the power adapter.  I ran mine under the molding in the interior of the car and you couldn't even see it.  Overall, it's a good seat for it's purpose.  They need to redesign or make another version for seats that have seatbelts attached.  And also work on the padding issue.
B00877SL2M|5|Fast delivery, very satisfied.
B004NKYJ9G|5|Fixed the hiccup my Mazda was having. Saved hundreds of dollars
B00M1Y3KZA|5|great deal.
B008Y71HXU|5|a+
B001DR7VX8|5|What a difference a new exhaust system made on my 2005 Grand Caravan.  I needed a new catalytic converter, and opted to replace the whole system in one move (especially since I am in New England and the components all rot out from the winter salt).<br /><br />I highly recommend having a local shop do the installation, as it is well worth the $$ to have the job done in an hour, and you still come out WAY ahead from having the local muffler shop sell you the material and labor.
B00DHVOKF0|5|Second order and great as gifts for biker friends.
B00316Y57Y|5|Shipping was quick and painless. This starter clutch gear is half the price of the harley davidson oem, and this one appears to be much better constructed as well. The gear comes with a ball bearing that can easily be overlooked in the sealed gear bag. Just a heads up.<br />IM very happy with this item so far and the entire transaction.<br />The install was for a 2010 Harley Davidson Touring motorcycle. Very easy replacement.
B001EOWQAS|5|Installed on my 2010 Highlander Limited with no issues. All the bolts line up perfect
B00LOYCIXI|5|great fit and addition to my dodge ram
B00V6XSMVE|5|Great product and quality. I wish the smaller ones had something on them too ;-(
B001BCK4A2|5|Perfect replacement.  Easy to install.
B00B82XA3S|1|I had a horrible time attempting to use this stuff. I purchased new headers for my car and the plan was to wrap them. Now to give you a little back story, I am a mechanic and I work at a dealership. I know my way around vehicles and have to do some pretty patience testing work at times. However working with this stuff infuriated me. I double wrapped the end of the wrap as you are supposed to. Then spiraling down the tube overlapping 1/4 inch. I watched a few youtube videos as well before I started just to make sure. Well I quickly found out that once this stuff starts to fray so does your patience. This stuff moves so easily that it also makes it difficult to keep in one place. In the end I got frustrated and pissed off throwing the whole thing in the trash minus the cuss words and the header. To those of you that have successfully wrapped your header and like how it looks kudos to you!
B00EPKZAQK|5|I love this helmet.  The pics on here doesn't do it justice.  The blue matches my atv, and looks mean.  About the sizing, go with their chart.  I know a lot of people says to go a size down.  I typically wear a xxl helmet.  My head is wider.  I measure 24' even,  I bought the xl, which says it goes to 24 1/2'.  It fits me snug, The paddings thin before it hits the styrofoam, so don't expect to sleep in it but I have worn it all day.  What it lacks in comfort it more than makes up with it's looks.  Not to mention the price is great!
B00M4YPWUS|4|Item is easy to put on the car and easy to put away. It keep the car cool and it does protect it from the rain. Great item!
B002P33854|5|Good quality tape for autobody refinishing. Great price can't go wrong.
B00ALI2R0M|5|Absolutely loved it! It shipped a lot faster than expected and when I put it on my car it turned out to look beautiful! Very happy and satisfied.
B0060HVFO2|1|This stuff does nothing whatsoever. I used increasingly fine wet and dry sandpaper on a plexiglass sheet, then tried this Scratch Out stuff to polish the surface and remove the fine scratches. The result was no polising effect or scratch removal. If anything, the scratches were even more apparent, and the surface even more dull.
B006N97F1E|4|parts are on & car working great :)
B0041CADZU|2|The battery I received was 2 and a half years old. A good battery but more than half its life was spent on a shelf. Worth going to another retailer for something newer.
B005OEA8YA|5|Cool stickers! And a lot of them.
B007PENKI8|5|Very well made, and works well, thanks!
B000GTVOGY|5|it's what you need.
B00VX2BCFG|5|Perfect
B002304W90|4|I ride my 2005 DRZ 400 SM as a commuter and wanted to reduce RPMs. I purchased this in combination with a JT 39T rear and it dropped about 12% of my revs in 5th and really settled down cruising on this bike from the 15/41 combo I had. As for power, I've got a bigger can and stroker crank so at 460cc I can't comment on the power difference from stock.<br /><br />There's a lot of mixed information on whether or not the 16T will fit, and I can proudly report that this one does... However it will take some modifications.<br /><br />The stock case protector is this little metal piece that runs parallel with the chain so if it ever breaks, the protector is destroyed before the case. I read about people just grinding it out about half an inch but it leaves you with a sliver of protection once everything's clear. Others just pulled it off all together. Instead I welded some metal tubing (spacers) to scrap steel cut out into the crescent moon shape and made my own. It took a bit more than I was expecting just to get the 16T sprocket in there, but the new protector is twice the thickess and more durable than stock. Well worth the upgrade.<br /><br />The other exception is you will have to take the rubber chain guard off the swing arm and grind out a line where the sprocket spins. Not a big deal, and this sprocket won't rub the swing arm itself.
B001UOYNK8|5|Worked like a charm

B009B9KWGS|1|Color not even close
B000FGEF6Y|5|Very nice product!  My husband bought it for his Chevy truck, to just add a little more storage for all of those little things - extra cup holders, phone, etc.  This is a good weight.  He put a little velcro on the bottom just to keep it from any movement at all.
B001ABPKUS|5|Works great excellent price......
B00GSAUHB8|5|Easy installation will buy again
B000RZPNOQ|4|Removed mildew.  Took some work and a little bleachy but worked as advertised.
