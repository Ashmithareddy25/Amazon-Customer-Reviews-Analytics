B00003CX5A|5.0|This film is an American horror classic, just like Washington Irving's  story.  I can't think of anyone better than Tim Burton to do it; and can't  think of anyone better than Ray Park to be the stuntman in the costume.  In  the director's commentary Burton says, &quot;when your character doesn't  have a head, you don't have a lot to go on except your ability with swords  and axes.&quot;  That's very true.  This movie would be excellent for a  Halloween party!
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is definitely a worldwide classic.  Everyone will love this one.  Although long (2 hrs. 57 min.) it doesn't drag.  I agree with the  reviewer who said that Mel does an excellent job of portraying a Scotsman;  unlike Kevin Costners sad attempt at being an Englishman.  A must for Mel  Gibson fans!
B00000K0E5|5.0|My favorte James Bond movie.  I've seen them all from Dr. No (1962) to The  World is Not Enough (1999).  Up until I saw Goldeneye, my favorite Bond was  Goldfinger (1964) which is now a close second place.  Goldeneye was the  second-best movie of 1995 next to Braveheart.  A movie set in modern times,  stunts, technology, actors, and characters, but still managed to preserve  that 1960's feel that 007 movies are known for.  Martin Campbell did a  magnificant job!
B000002J1F|5.0|The penultimate progressive rock disc, by the penultimate progressive rock  band.  This disc is beyond judgement, and ought to be used as the  definition of 70's progressive rock.  All other progressive rock bands  strive (whether they know it or not) to attain this level of perfection.   If you want to know what Yes is about, this is the disc to own.
B000002HK4|3.0|Unfortunately, the impression I got from this disc was they went overboard  with trying to put out a concept/progressive rock disc.  The first track  sounds completely contrived for this sake, and I never felt enough emotion  in the music.  It didn't have that &quot;grind&quot; or  &quot;massiveness&quot; that Images and Words had. Just a lot of  pseudo-intellectual attitude.  I think this is because each of the  musicians are probably above average, but no one stands out as an  innovator.  The cover tunes are impressive for the range of songs chosen,  but again it was a sign that they were simply too tired to write another  tedious 23 minute proletariat opus.  The rover is great work out music.   That's about the only track I listen to anymore.  By the way, it's  painfully obvious the singer is no Steve Perry.
B000006OAM|5.0|I became a fan of Natalie Merchant with the release of  &quot;Tigerlilly&quot;. This second release is more meditative and less  radio oriented, but is an excellent collection of music. I am suprised to  read critics of the CD unhappy with the moods and themes Merchant has  produced. It is a more meditative collection more reminicient of &quot;San  Andreas Fault&quot; than &quot;Carnival&quot;, or &quot;Wonder&quot;; both  radio hits. &quot;Ophelia&quot; has its share of radio music, but is also  full of meditative works that listeners will enjoy.
B0000027RL|5.0|THE BAND: Eddie Vedder (vocals, guitar), Stone Gossard (guitars), Mike McCready (guitars), Jeff Ament (bass), Dave Krusen (drums & percussion). On the initial tour, drummer Krusen was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who was then replaced by Dave Abbruzzese.<br /><br />THE DISC: (1991-debut) 11 tracks clocking in at approximately 53 minutes. Included with the disc is a 9-page foldout containing the large/full picture of which the album cover comes from, song titles/credits, song lyrics, and thank you's. All lyrics written by Vedder. All music written by band members (the most belonging to Gossard - 8 credits). There is a European release as well containing 3 bonus tracks (a live version of \\"Alive\\" and two unreleased studio songs). Recorded at London Bridge Studios, Seattle, WA. Label - Sony/Epic.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Pearl Jam was part of the whole Seattle 'grunge' movement back in the early 90's... along with Nirvana, Alice In Chains and Soundgarden. Nirvana may have started it, but in my opinion Pearl Jam finished it. Pearl Jam's albums and songs were more mainstream rock with a grunge edge - and faired way better on the Billboard charts. Success might spell \\"sell out\\" for some, but for me an entire Pearl Jam album was easier to listen to than one of Nirvana's. 12+ million units sold and growing every year, \\"Ten\\" was one of the best selling records of the 90's. Four big hits came from \\"Ten\\" - \\"Alive\\" (#16 on the charts), \\"Even Flow\\" (#3), \\"Black\\" (reaching #3 on the charts, though never being released as a \\"single\\"), and \\"Jeremy\\" (#5 and an MTV favorite - winning 4 awards... including best video of the year). The song \\"Oceans\\" received minor airplay as well. This album also won Pearl Jam 2 American Music Awards (Favorite Pop/Rock artist, and Favorite New Metal/Hard Rock Artist). Rolling Stone magazine ranks \\"Ten\\" at #207 on their '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' list. The first 6 songs on \\"Ten\\" are great rocking tunes... not to mention the best on the album. If there was ever a perfect album side - this would be it. As good as the hard rocking tunes are, the slowest one, \\"Black\\" might be my favorite. Of the six songs, all but \\"Why Go\\" made their \\"Rearviemirrow: Greatest Hits 1991-2003\\" release. Along with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" defined the grunge movement. A classic album (5 stars).fect album side - this would be it. As good as the hard rocking tunes are, the slowest one, \\"Black\\" might be my favorite.

0893815500|5.0|Mere words cannot do justice to the images contained in this book.  To  describe them as powerful, moving and dramatic only hints at the impact  that they can have on the sensitive viewer.  Salgado has poured his heart  and soul into these photographs, and it shows in the intense humanity  contained therein.  I find myself returning again and again to  &quot;Workers&quot; and each time feeling greater empathy for the people  whose lives of labor are so stunningly displayed.  Salgado's technique and  vision are unsurpassed, but it is his passion that makes these photos so  awe inspiring.  He has indeed performed a great service to  manual laborers  everywhere by showing their struggles to the rest of us, who now must  accord them a very large measure of respect and admiration.
B000001EL3|5.0|THE BAND: Gene Simmons (Gene Klein), Paul Stanley (Stanley Eisen), Ace Frehley (Paul Frehley), Peter Criss (Peter Crisscoula).<br /><br />THE DISC: Released 3/15/76. Recorded at The Record Plant, NYC. 9 songs clocking in at approximately 34 minutes. A classic album cover painted by Ken Kelly. Originally released on Casablanca Records in 1975; this remastered edition was released in 1997 on Mercury's label. Much improved sound in my book (deeper bass guitars and crisper highs). Liner notes are slim - a 3 page fold out with song titles, writing credits, song times, lyrics to one song (\\"Detroit Rock City\\"), and a KISS Army logo. Underneath the disc on the inside cover, there's an informative 5 paragraph history of what the band was going through at the time.<br /><br />COMMENTS: A classic studio album from KISS, and easily one of their best efforts. Decades later, it still rocks like no other KISS album. How to keep the momentum going...? New songs, new costumes, new feel, new producer... enter Bob Ezrin. A KISS album with a choir, orchestra and lots of sound effects. This was Ezrin's doing. Along with Paul and Gene each co-writing 4 songs, and Peter with 1, Ezrin helped co-write 7 with the band. Ezrin gave the album depth and a very theatrical and polished feel. I truly believe 7 of the 9 songs here are some of the best the band has ever written... the exceptions being \\"Great Expectations\\" and \\"God Of Thunder\\" (always a better song in concert). Not many KISS albums (outside of \\"Alive!) can claim that. \\"Flaming Youth\\", \\"Sweet Pain\\", \\"Detroit Rock City\\", \\"King of the Night Time World\\" and \\"Do You Love Me\\" are all hard rock classics. The unexpected ballad \\"Beth\\" is Peter's best song (earning KISS a People's Choice Award in 1977). \\"Shout it out loud\\" was a tune created in the same vein as \\"Rock & Roll All Nite\\".... one of those anthems written for the youth. \\"Destroyer\\" is filled with great songs - a KISS studio classic.
B00000J2KY|2.0|As much as I admire the work of Stanley Kubrick,I have to admit this if  one of his lesser films. There are wonderful performances by James Mason  and Sue Lyon. Though Shelley Winters' character did start to get on my  nerves. I hope ALL women aren't as pushy as she was! And as for Peter  Sellers. Well besides the first scene,he really started to annoy me. The  main problem with the movie is the script which was written by Vladmir  Nabokov,who also wrote the novel from which the movie is based on. But  after a while you just start to not care about the characters invovled(at  least I did). The script doesn't have any &quot;heart&quot;. You don't care  what happens to Mason or Lyon. Or anyone else in the movie. After a while  Mason just seems pathetic chasing after a 14 year old girl. For what seemed  to be a good begining,everything just seemed to go downhill from there.  Maybe if there was more comedy to it. How about Woody Allen remaking the  movie ..... Then maybe you might  have something. From all of Kubrick's films this is one of a few you should  stay away from.  ** 1\2 out of *****
B0000039LE|5.0|A GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVED IT! SUPER! SWEET! COOL! OUT OF SIGHT! GET  THIS MOVIE1 THE BEST OF THEM ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000002UW1|5.0|Mr Knopper's review was so off the mark, it is laughable.  the quote from  'Disturbance at the Heron House' goes: &quot;Try to tell us something we  don't know&quot;.  It is to me a song about the citizenry trying to  confront a distant and arrogant government that is ready to quash any sign  of discontent.  It shows a focus and depth of thought by Stipe (and any  others who helped), not some ramblings of a star bemused by his band's  growing popularity or something like that. This album has many songs about  American political views and cultural forces that I think are very  perceptive and beautifully rendered artistically.
B000002L7J|4.0|Although this wasn't as amazing as their debut, it still remains a great  album. The subjects on this album range from school abuse to the vegan epic  &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;. This also had one of The Smith's big hits  &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;. Morrissey's anger comes out more in these set  of lyrics than their first self-titled album and Marr progresses musically.  All and all its a great album but not their best.
B000002U88|5.0|I recently listened to this album for the first time in five years or more  and was really impressed with strength of the album. Seven of the nine  songs are the type that are not skipped to reach another more favorite  song. <br />The album also features perhaps Seger's best song of his career,  &quot;Roll Me Away&quot;, and the top notch &quot;Shame On The Moon&quot;.  The rest of the material is solid rock music that make Seger the best at  what he does.
B000000W5L|5.0|Five songs into &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot; and I'm thinking there is  thirteen more songs to come? It could end at &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; and  I'd be happy. This album has everything; Rock, Soul, Blues and even a  little jazz. Everytime I listen to this album it makes me think of walking  around the streets of New Orleans. See how &quot;I Just Wanna See His  Face&quot; infuelnced Tom Waits and this album infuelnce Noel Gallagher to  write &quot;Live Forever&quot;. Everyone must own this album. Most likely  The Rolling Stones best album.
B000003337|5.0|This is a great album, and as one of the other reviewers said it is great that Kevin Dubrow took the time to put out this tribute to the late great  Randy Rhoads. Even though his playing is nothing compared to his later  works with Ozzy, and the lyrics are kind of cheesy, and the overall sound  of the band is pop metal doesn't mean that it's not good. To be totally  honest even if Randy Rhoads wasn't on this album i'd still be inot it. I  think that Kevin Dubrow has an amazingly powerful voice and the rhythm  section at that time which featured Kelly Garni on bass and Drew Forsyth on  drums was very powerful and solid, and Randy's playing was top notch.<br />The  album begins with the song Trouble. This song was originally on Quiet Riot  2. The first 2 Quiet Riot albums were only released in Japan. There was  also another album that was recorded but never released. Trouble is a great  song and probably the best on this compilation. Randy's solo is great as  usual. The next song is amazing also. It is a live version of Laughing Gas  which features an extended solo from Randy and was recorded at the  legendary L.A. club The Starwood. It's also cool because he plays parts in  the solo that he used in Ozzy. In the middle of the solo he plays parts  from Dee and Goodbye to Romance, and when the band comes back in they play  the beginning of Crazy Train. The next song is Afterglow (Of your Love.) It  is a great song. It's all acoustic except for the solo. It was originally  from Quiet Riot 2 but this is a different version. Killer Girls is an  upbeat pop metal song. It's a pretty good song. Again like every other song  features amazing guitar work by Randy Rhoads. The next song Picking Up the  Pieces is as pop as you're gonna get on this album. It was taken from the  album Quiet Riot 3 which was never released. It is definately one of the  best songs on this album. It also features Randy Rhoads playing bass after  Kelly Garni quit the band. Last Call for Rock and Roll isanother  unreleased song. It was originally written for QR1 but never made it on the  album. Breaking Up is a Heartache is the next song. This song like Picking  Up the Pieces was on QR3. It also features Randy on bass. The solo in this  song is also great because it is prett much the same solo that Randy used  in the rare Ozzy song You Looking at Me Looking at You which was the b-side  to the original Crazy Train single. On the next song Force of Habit Randy  is playing the riff from Suicide Solution during the verse. The next song  It's Not So Funny has an amazing solo. It's great because Randy double  tracked it. It sounds amazing. This song is also similar to their post  Randy songs. The last song on the album Look In Any Window was written by  Randy. It is another amazing song with amazing guitar playing. I hope that  one day there will be a Randy Rhoads Years Volume 2 becuase there is still  many amazing songs that haven't seen the light of day. I suggest this album  to anyone, especially guitar players and pop metal fans. I also reccommend  the Ozzy albums Blizzard of Ozz, Diary of a Madman, and Tribute because  they feature Randy's amazing guitar playing.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Star Wars-Just the name brings the senses in your mind flying. In my opinion the best movies of all time, it has everything you want in a good  movie:Action, romance, excitement, danger and adventure. These elements are  rarely found all together in a single film franchise and if they are it is  usually put together very badly. For adults this takes them back to their  childhood years, pretending to play games like cowboys and indians, I mean  tell me someone who has watched star wars and not pretended to have   lightsabre fights with their little brother, and for the kids these movies  give them a sense of adventure inside. These three movies are the best of  all time. Trust me if you haven't seen star wars already you might as well  order this now, you will want to watch it again and again.
0140277447|5.0|Hmmm . . . the Japanese right-wing propaganda machine has swung into  action again. Just read the latest review by this reader from MA, USA. I'll  bet my bottom dollar  that it's submitted by one of the previous Iris  Chang-bashing Japanese reviewers  masquerading as an American reader,  complete with an American location.  <br />In fact, many negative reviews here  have obviously been submitted in the same way.  There is clearly a  systematic, ongoing effort to discredit Chang and her book here.  These  fanatic Japanese emperor-worshippers are nothing if not tenacious!<br />On a  related note, I just read in the papers the other day that a Japanese  far-right  organization has proposed yet another revision to Japanese  high-school history textbooks.  The proposed revision, if approved by the  Ministry of Education, would again gloss over  Japanese aggression during  WWII and take back even the extremely vague and limited  reference to the  Rape of Nanking that Japanese textbooks currently carry.    <br />Sickening,  isn't it? Let's hope for the sake of peace and humanity that the Japanese  never  get tired of merely buying up the world with their money.
B00004U9MS|4.0|Well with all the hype surrounding the release, not to mention a BIG delay  of the domesitic release. (looks like November at the earliest) I broke  down and shelled out the import cash for this disc. Believe me I'm glad I  did. Fans of everyone from Jeff Buckley, Travis and even Dave Matthews will  find things they like about Coldplay. This is a well put together record  full of nicely crafted slow tempo, alt/pop tunes. Nice couple of singles in  Yellow and Shiver but we've all heard this stuff before. As well as the  other gems that really do exsist here. If your looking for a disc to blow  you away, as well as justify an import purchase, I'd first get the Doves,  &quot;Lost Souls&quot; record. A much more complex and far superior  release.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Fleetwood Mac went from being a little known blues rock group with tons of  admiration to the biggest pop/rock stars of the seventies and parts of the  eighties with the additions of Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, and  Stevie Nicks.  Each of them brought not only personal ideals of music into  the group but enchanting rock songs that laid a spell on an era.  Let's go  through the selections of songs that each member is known for as  signatures.<br />Buckingham is a brilliant guitar player with a great plucking  style.  The words of his music are often personal and very engrossing.   Lindsey is known for everything from heartbreak of &quot;Go Your Own  Way&quot; to a powerful combo of drums extravaganza that is  &quot;Tusk&quot;.  I personally really like the modern big pop twist on a  journey for Miss right on &quot;Big Love&quot;.  Not only are writings  introspectively great, but his playing really gave the group a great rock  sound that isn't to light or to soft.  His influence as a producer is felt  all over this collection.<br />Christine really sent the group into the  stratosphere of pop hits.  Simple but elegant little nuggets of AOR  goodness like &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Over My Head&quot; are  cute accounts of romance yet very upbeat and not to encompassing.  Light  touches of eighties wonder are found on &quot;Everywhere&quot; and  &quot;Little Lies&quot;.  You wonder if the latter was about her  relationship with ex-husband and bass player John McVie after years of  divorce.  The songs have that simple quality of not being too much, but  making you think a little.  While you might find her pieces on love a  little bit thought provoking, something like &quot;Don't Stop&quot; is just  uplifting and positive with that great rock sound.  <br />Last but certainty  not least is the great little gypsy herself Stevie Nicks.  Her mesmerizing  arrangements captured something special in the band and the era of the  seventies.  Her music become some of the most intoxicating of the band's  with spooky sounds yet still staying very much into the groove of there big  rock/pop sound.  &quot;Rhiannon&quot; is darkly hypnotic and the guitar  arrangement reflects that.  This sound of sincerely fascinating lyric and  sound continued on everything the heart pouring &quot;Gypsy&quot; to the  light California rock of &quot;Dreams&quot; (most certainty about Lindsey).   She created a very unique sound with the group that can't be copied.   Listen to her solo records, which are worlds apart from this sound.<br />Much  credit should also go to the great playing of founders Mick Fleetwood and  John McVie and their willingness to evolve with each record to sounds of  the seventies and eighties radio yet still keeping to their roots.  The set  is full of great rock songs that aren't too loud but aren't wimpy either.   The group has made a great pop rock sound that can't be duplicated.  A must  have set for lovers of the band and just anybody interested in the  seventies and eighties.  I do know that &quot;newer&quot; Fleetwood tracks  with &quot;newer&quot; members are no here, but those are honestly though  away.  The band lost it's edge big time when Lindsey left.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I went into this film with low expectations, and came out absolutely thrilled. Personally, I think this is one of the best movies I've ever  seen.
B00003CXE6|5.0|An outstanding portrayal of the barbaric customs of the Romans!  From the opening battle scene to the climactic duel in the end, you're on the edge  of your seat!  Nonstop intense action and excellent acting make this movie  a top-5 for me and my dad.   <br />A clear line is shown between just plain  revenge and duty to country- going along with a dethroned General's motto:   strength and honor.  A classic, good guy vs. bad guy movie where the  protagonist is someone to look up to, someone with leadership  qualities.<br />A hand also for Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, who did the  score for this film!  Bravisimo!
B000002BE9|4.0|Fiona Apple's &quot;Tidal&quot; is the soundtrack to my life.  Every song  on the CD is beautiful.  Apple's sultry voice brings life to lyrics that  read like Keats.  One can't help but sing along to &quot;Criminal;&quot;  after all, aren't all us girls &quot;bad, bad girls&quot; every once in a  while?  It's incredible that these songs were written and performed by a  nineteen-year-old.  Apple brings a very adult wisdom and worldliness to her  songwriting, and the end result is a CD which you will listen to all the  way through and applaud at the end.
0440224764|4.0|This is a good book that will keep your interest.  Not on par with  Grisham's best novel, The Firm, but still enjoyable.  The one flaw in the  book comes with the ending.  I'm still not sure why the book ends the way  it does or what it adds to the story.  Cut the last few pages out and it's  a five star book.
6305537798|4.0|&quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; is a teensploitation movie. Don't get me wrong, because that's not a bad thing. At least, it doesn't *have*  to be a bad thing. But the reason that most people over the age of 21 groan  when they hear about yet *another* movie about teenagers, is because the  teensploitation fad has given us the recent &quot;Scary Movie,&quot; and  less-recent releases like &quot;American Pie,&quot; &quot;She's All  That,&quot; &quot;Varsity Blues,&quot; &quot;Can't Hardly Wait,&quot; and  the abysmal &quot;Drive Me Crazy.&quot; Now, there's nothing wrong with  putting a bunch of attractive twenty-somethings in a plot about the trials  and tribulations of high school. But (and this is my only complaint about  &quot;10 Things&quot;) could they at least aim for a little more realism?  Whose high school looks like a castle? Who has gone to their senior prom to  find all the attendees dancing in unison? Who's ever had an inappropriate  sexual encounter with an apple pie, and who has ever had a hot exchange  student masturbate on their bed, live on the internet?<br />Other than the few  instances where the viewer is forced to suspend disbelief (come on, we all  know that Joey Donner is a closet nancy-boy), &quot;10 Things&quot; is a  pretty good movie. If it weren't for modernized versions of the Bard, many  of us wouldn't be able to stomach the mandatory studying of &quot;Romeo and  Juliet,&quot; &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream,&quot; &quot;Macbeth,&quot;  and of course &quot;The Taming of the Shrew.&quot; By putting the plot and  characters in a setting that most people understand-high school-the  filmmakers have proven that Shakespeare's work is truly timeless, and  definitely worth studying. (I don't mean to insult Shakespeare fans out  there-in fact, I admire you; you're a lot smarter than I am!)<br />&quot;10  Things&quot; is funny and has its touching moments-like when Patrick (Heath  Ledger, &quot;The Patriot's&quot; adorable Aussie) serenades Kat (Julia  Stiles) in the stadium. When I saw that scene, I thought, &quot;Who cares  if it's believable? That's so sweet!&quot; Several notably good scenes  include the party, where the writers say (by way of the students'  acceptance of social outcast Kat only after she performs a drunken  table-dance, something she would never normally do) that &quot;everyone's  popular when you're drunk.&quot; During the inevitable prom scene, when  Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fights with Joey (Andrew Keegan, in a  wonderfully snotty performance) to defend the honor of Bianca (Larisa  Oleynik), it shows that likes her for who she is, and not just because  she's pretty.<br />The movie has good character development and some great  acting, especially by Ledger, David Krumholtz as Cameron's A/V Club pal,  and Allison Janney as a demented guidance counsellor. Don't write it off as  just another teen flick-it's a big fish in a small pond, and it's not only  watchable, it's enjoyable.
B00003CWNR|4.0|John Irving adapted his novel for the screen and kept many of the best parts. The film is set in rural Maine in the late 1930s. Much of the film centers of the orphanage run by the crusty Dr. Larch, wonderfully played by Michael Caine. He cares deeply for the orphans, especially for the grown-up Homer (Tobey Maguire) who has remained at the orphanage. The scenes in the orphanage are very touching, and the hurt that Larch feels when Tobey chooses to leave the orphanage is quite real. The movie also tells the tale of Tobey's life outside of the orphanage (and shows the doctor trying to get him back) as Tobey works on an apple farm. The characters are very well-drawn and very believable. Most of the film is quite engaging, though I found that it sometimes dragged when we moved from the Larch/Tobey relationship. In particular, there was a very rather extended and unsettling subplot of incest in a farmworker's family that really did not add much to the movie at all.<br />By and large, this is a very good movie with great characters, real human interest, and and an excellent viusal look in terms of the period it covers. If you like the movie, the book builds on it very nicely, though the plot diverges in that it takes the story well beyond the time covered by the movie.
0451191153|5.0|As a student of architecture (now recently graduated), I found this book  inspiring, powerful, elegant and philosophicaly rich. Although it sometimes  feels long and slow, the philosophy, struggle and goals of the characters  are quite convincing and exhilarating. I recommend it to architecture  students who want to find a source of inspiration and a connection between  architecture and its creator.
0790731452|4.0|The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was a big dissappointment.  Then I started to think about it.  Usually, when I dislike something for no  reason that I can really put my finger on, it is because it has challenged  my expectations in some way.  For this reason, I like to re-examine my  feelings about those things.  And often, after reflection, I realize what  it is that disturbs me, and I realize why the thing that I hate addresses  that, and often it makes me enjoy the thing I &quot;Hated&quot;  more.<br />This movie is like that. One of the things that bothered me so much  was the lack of reason for the alien attack, and their resulting brutality.   A little after I watched the movie, I found out why this is so, while  reading a book &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me,&quot; which related the  following tale concerning Columbus:<br />In 1492, Colomubus landed in what is  now the Dominican Republic.  He got off of the boat, and read a short  proclimation that said (essentially,)  &quot;I am taking this place over,  you must now immediatly renounce your pagan gods, convert to Christianity,  claim Isabella of Spain as your ruler, or I will make you slaves, and you  will work until you die, and I will not be held responsible for your  souls.&quot;  Columbus read this proclimation in Spanish, which of course,  none of the native people of the Dominican Republic could understand.  They  greeted him with a huge party, and Columbus proceeded to decimate the  natives.  The Spaniards forced the Indians to work, and rode on their backs  rather than walk from place to place.  Does this not strike you as  ridiculous? The same kind of mindless destruction for the sake of  destruction that the movie portrays?<br />What disturbed me about the movie  was it's quiet censure of our society, our modern world, our own arrogance.   In this movie we get our comeuppance, and it is delivered with the same  heartless passion that our uncivilized ancestors imposed on the indigenouspopulations. There is no why or how, there is only the relentless onslaught  of a technologically superior race that finds glee in our destruction, who  no doubt, intend to usurp our world.<br />In the War of the Worlds, we are  saved by Influenza, in real life, Influenza and small pox, brought by  Euroopeans, decimated indigenous populations.  Wells original parallel was  intended to be a subtle irony, a tribute to our tiniest, and most  unobtrusive weapon.  <br />Here we are saved by Slim Whitman's &quot;Indian  Love Call,&quot; an outrageous twist, but not one without it's irony.   Whitman wrote the song as an appeal to the romanticization of the American  Indian that occurred in the late 50's. It bears no real ties to native  american lore or tradition, other than it's name.  It is a romantic view of  a past that never happened, our &quot;plasticization&quot; of the very  people we've killed.  Isn't it odd that we would be saved by a cheesy  lounge song written about a people we killed with smallpox and war, while  we are being decimated with no hope of survival, in much the same manner?   Its doubly ironic that something so insidious, both in sound, and concept,  should turn out to be invariably fatal to our invaders.  Our bad taste  killed them. <br />I might suggest to those that are easily angered when their  expectations of an &quot;Independance Day&quot; style romp are foiled, that  they examine their dissappointment and ask themselves, &quot;why did this  bother me so much?&quot;  When you do, you'll often find that you are being  challenged to think or look at a thing in another light by your brain,  which is often smarter than you might think.
B0000046PE|5.0|Ella Fitzgerald was simply the best.  No two ways about it; that's the  best way to describe her.  And this boxed set showcases nothing but her  very best recordings, pulled from the best years of her career at the Verve  Jazz label.  Starting in 1949 and going through the late '60s, there are  three CDs and nearly twenty years of pure perfection to enjoy here.  <br />All  the ones you've always heard about are here.  Her heartbreaking &quot;Angel  Eyes,&quot; &quot;April in Paris&quot; with Count Basie and His Orchestra,  and the untouchable recording of &quot;Summertime&quot; with Louis  Armstrong.  You can't listen to that one and not think, &quot;Wow.&quot;   Satchmo and Lady Time do one of the greatest duets in jazz with &quot;Can't  We Be Friends.&quot;  Her &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; is included, with the  brassy classic &quot;After You've Gone.&quot;  The two best tracks from her  concert set with Duke Ellington at the Cote d'Azur, Jobim's popping  &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; and Duke's rowdy &quot;It Don't Mean a Thing,&quot;  are present also; listen to how saxophone-like she sounds in her scat  session on &quot;Samba,&quot; and how she wails like one of the trumpets  and becomes one of the band on &quot;Don't Mean a Thing.&quot;  &quot;Let  it Snow&quot; represents her 'Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas,&quot;  one Christmas CD every jazz fan should own; and yes, the legendary live  Berlin version of &quot;Mack the Knife,&quot; where Ella forgets the words  halfway through and goes through a mean scat before launching into her  crowd-pleasing Louis Armstrong impression, as well as the unbelievable  scatting on the track that followed it, &quot;How High the Moon,&quot;  which sealed that song into Ella's repetoire along with  &quot;Mack.&quot;<br />Good helpings of Ella's 'Great American Songbook'  series are here.  Her treatment of Cole Porter's &quot;Too Darn Hot&quot;  matched with that great arrangement is jazz perfection.  From her kingly  Duke EllingtonSongbook album, &quot;Just a Lucky So and So&quot; is one of  Ella's best, bluesy and soulful, with letter-perfect solos by Duke and the  marvelous Johnny Hodges.  She has great fun on &quot;Get Happy,&quot; and  the beautiful arrangement of Arlen's &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; (you know,  the song from 'Big'), with its heavenly waterfall of strings in the intro,  gives Ella just what she needs to make this one a keeper.  Irving Berlin's  &quot;Blue Skies&quot; is Ella at her finest, swinging free and easy, as  the song starts off light and builds to a screaming climax.<br />Along with  the famous ones, this set is also notable for so many great Ella recordings  that cannot be found on CD elsewhere.  This includes the stomping  eight-minute-plus Jazz at the Philharmonic All-Stars version of  &quot;Perdido,&quot; with Roy Eldridge, Charlie Parker, and a bandful of  greats backing Ella, a gorgeous live &quot;Lullaby of Birdland,&quot; a  Latin cover of &quot;A-Tisket, A-Tasket&quot; from the 1950s, the breezy  &quot;Swingin' Shepherd Blues,&quot; and Ella's superb &quot;Don't Be That  Way.&quot;  Other not-so-well-known treats are a smooth, poetic &quot;Night  in Tunisia&quot; that rivals Dizzy's wild original; Ella blowing every  other version of &quot;Black Coffee&quot; out of the water; sugar-rush  scatting on &quot;Air-Mail Special&quot;; the blues with Wild Bill Davis on  organ with &quot;Hear Me Talkin' to Ya&quot;; and a seductive and swinging  &quot;Hernando's Hideaway,&quot; with lyrics set to the tune of the popular  tango melody.  Ella's &quot;Makin' Whoopee&quot; is, I guarantee you, one  of the funniest songs you'll ever hear.  It goes on and on, drawing bigger  laughs with each verse, and Ella sings it with a wink and milks it for  every laugh, especially that last verse!  Perhaps the best, and most sadly  little-known, recording here is Ella wailing through a bold, brassy  arrangement of &quot;Can't Buy Me Love.&quot;  While Ella's reading here is  nowhere near the golden treatment she gave it on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' in  1964, the arrangement never fails to stun, and is still one of the best  jazz arrangements I've ever heard.<br />There will never be another Ella.  Buy  this set, and see just why.
0446605409|3.0|While this book was very predictable it was still very entertaining.  I  didn't enjoy it as much as The Gold Coast but it is more of a DeMille style  book.  There is good suspense the book is very funny.  I found myself  laughing with the main character, John Corey, at his comments on other  characters in the story.  The story is very formulaic but there are couple  twists that keep it interesting.  It was very obvious to me early one what  was being smuggled off the island but it was done pretty well.
B00000JGOJ|4.0|I found the movie to be a real find and worth watching several times over.   All of the acting was superb and I loved how the  individual stories  eventually were tied together for a very moving and surprising ending.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! NOW!:Be forewarned tho, that the DVD version of the  movie is very, very poor in image quality - fuzzy, grainy, with the images  breaking up into blocks.  I had two copies come to me and had them both  returned with identical problems.  Miramax appears to have had a bad  transfer or the original master damaged.  The videocassette version is of  better visual quality (which is a contradiction unto itself when compared  to DVD!).
B000001G1E|5.0|Bigger fans of James Brown may know, but I am just guessing that many of the jewels in the James Brown anthology STAR TIME had been out-of-print records before they were included in this collection. As overpriced as CDs are (according to rock critic Dave Marsh, CDs only cost pennies more to manufacture than tapes or vinyl but retail for several dollars more), their popularity seems to be enough reason for record companies to re-release the songs for which fans have searched.<br /><br />Buried treasures of the prolific, multi-decade R&B career of James Brown were unearthed to shine once again on STAR TIME. You cannot listen to STAR TIME in one sitting not because of its four-CD length but because you will want to get on your feet and dance.<br /><br />Those who find box sets overblown should have no complaints with STAR TIME. James Brown has been grooving so long that even a collection this lengthy leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />Amazon's lead review points out STAR TIME's inclusion of the full-length, correct-speed \\"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag.\\" The shorter, hit edit you hear on the radio is a sped-up version. Maybe they had to cut the time for radio play but who knows why they changed the playing speed - the original smokes like a forest fire! More STAR TIME surprises include the full-length \\"Sex Machine\\" and \\"Cold Sweat.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the STAR TIME versions of \\"Say It Loud\\" and \\"Hot Pants\\" turn out to be edited. Bummer. And why were essential James Brown songs \\"I'm Real,\\" \\"Living In America\\" (perhaps his biggest hit) and the instrumental \\"Popcorn\\" excluded? I could almost rate STAR TIME at just four stars because of those flaws. But the souvenier booklet that accompanies the four CDs raises its value back up to five stars.<br /><br />Long live the music of James Brown. Get STAR TIME!
B00002Z88D|5.0|What happens when Metallica, the world's best rock band, joins up with The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, the best Symphony Orchestra in the U.S.?  You get an album like S&amp;M. This is basically a Metallica Greatest Hits  Album with two unreleased songs (No Leaf Clover and -Human), &quot;The  Ecstasy of Gold (by Ennio Morricone), and an orchestra giving their music  an entirely new dimension. The album starts with two solos: the orchestra  playing &quot;The Ecstasy of Gold&quot;, and Metallica playing &quot;The  Call of the Ktulu&quot;. Then it goes into &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;,  which the orchestra and audience join in and add something enitrely new and  exciting to a Metallica classic. &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot;, and &quot;The  Thing that Should Not Be&quot; are also made extremely better using the  orchestra. &quot;Fuel&quot;, which has always sounded better live, is  played here sounding the best I've ever heard it. &quot;Memory  Remains&quot; is also enhanced, with the crowd yelling out the &quot;na na  na's&quot; at the end, as well as singing some of the chorus. &quot;No Leaf  Clover&quot; is the better of the two unreleased songs, and one that  Metallica should defenitely put on their next album if they make one.  &quot;Hero of the Day&quot;, &quot;Devils Dance&quot;, and &quot;Bleeding  Me&quot; finish out the first disc.<br />Disc 2 starts with something slower,  &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; (which sounds the same as on the Black  Album because orchestral instruments were used then, too), then jumps into  &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot;, which, along with &quot;Fuel&quot;, is faster  paced on S&amp;M than on the original albums. &quot;For Whom the Bell  Tolls&quot; is exceptionally better on S&amp;M, thanks in part to the  crowd, who sings about half of the song. &quot;-Human&quot; is another  unreleased song, and, along with &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot;, it is a great  Metallica song that could be played on an album without the orchestra.  &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; is a bit weaker at the beginning because of  the orchestra droning out the egyptian-like music that starts the song on  the Black Album. &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot;, &quot;Sad But True&quot;, and  &quot;One&quot; are all well performed by both Metallica and the Orchestra.  Finally we come to probably the most widely known Metallica song:  &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;.  The orchestral music adds two minutes onto the  song, but that makes it all the better, with a very dramatic finishing part  by the orchestra. S&amp;M finishes with a standing ovation,  &quot;Battery&quot;, and the thanking of the fans and orchestra by  Hatfield.  Certainly a job well done by Metallica and a five star album.
B000002AH7|5.0|You are a Spaniard living abroad and suddenly someone comes up with a  Miles Davis record called &quot;Sketches of  Spain&quot; and they really  want your opinion about it. So you begin to fear the worst about listening  to a &quot;jazzy&quot; Saeta or a Solea and prepare yourself for a shock,  you close your eyes and all of a sudden you are in Seville. From that very  moment I could not stop listening to it, It is not the quality of the Jazz  played, it is the fact that Davis was able to understand all the strong  feelings involved. I do recommend everyone who loves this album to get hold  of a &quot;flamenco cd&quot; and you will really understand what it is so  great about it.

B000008H1Y|4.0|This album is a very strong collection of songs, even for Tull standards.   There is a lot of acoustic instrumentation on this album, but its the  arrangements and tension between the sweeter acoustic passages and the  chaotic, almost symphonic prog that leaves its mark.  &quot;Songs From The  Wood&quot; has some outstanding vocal arrangements, almost choral-like in  their intricacies.  And what Tull album is complete without a classic Ian  Anderson &quot;dirty old man&quot; song like &quot;Hunting Girl&quot;?  The  second half of this disc, starting with the mini-epic &quot;Velvet  Green&quot;, is absolutely faultless.  The tone of the disc is celebration  and merriment, and it really shines out in songs like the frenetic  &quot;The Whistler&quot; and especially &quot;Ring Out, Solstice  Bells.&quot;   Only Jethro Tull could make prog out of a wedding song.   Although they only really rock out on &quot;Pibroch (Cap In Hand)&quot;  -which starts out eerily enough with an ultra-heavy delayed Martin Barre  riff that could have come right out of Aqualung - don't make the mistake of  assuming this album is light and airy.  If you're a fan of really  distinctive progressive rock, Tull is the band for you, the arrangements  and songwriting on this album are fantastic, exciting and without peer.  If  you're unfamiliar with Tull, this is also a great album to start with,  perhaps not as classic as _Aqualung_ or _Thick_As_A_Brick_ but you really  can't go wrong here.
B00004U3UG|2.0|Right off the bat let me say that the visual quality of this DVD is THEE  worst i have ever seen. I saw the movie twice in the theater and at least a  half dozen times on VHS and i never remember that quality being this bad.  Some of the scenes are restored beautifully, while some are just horrible.  The action scenes are a blurry mess, especially the windmill scene. Very  distracting. The fact that this is Director approved makes me question Sam  Raimi's ability as a Filmmaker. Another big problem i had with this film is  that it's not Dolby 5.1. A six speaker system is wasted here. 2.0 is weak  weak weak! The deleted scenes are interesting and the commentary is  entertaining but it's not enough for me to recommend this DVD to anyone.
B000002LRX|5.0|Angel Dust is one insanely schizophrenic trip into the warped minds of these five gents. You can analyze it endlessly, but its a work of  undeniable artistic daring (some might say commercial suicide). If you take  it from any point A to any point B it never travels in a straight line. Who  else would put a undeniably frightening song like &quot;Malpractice,&quot;  which is bordering on death metal, on the same platter with the undeniably  hard and funky &quot;Crack Hitler&quot;, travelling straight through  stream-of-consciousness indictment of white trash with &quot;R.V.&quot;,  sidelong with a not-so-subtle plea for oral sex on &quot;Be  Aggressive&quot;, and then end the album with a perfectly faithful  rendition of the theme to &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; ?  These guys define  eclectic and then step all over it.<br />The key to this band, and this album,  is &quot;the keys&quot;. Instead of soloing endlessly Roddy Bottum uses his  keyboards to provide minimalist, eerie soundscapes to Patton's nasal  demented ramblings.  On _The Real Thing_ they were almost poppy, here they  are menacing - check out the pipe-organ ending of &quot;Jizzlobber&quot; -  and they set the tone for the album wherever you  look. Patton, by the way,  is the most versatile rock vocalist around. He can pull off anything from  grindcore through doo-wop straight to prog-metal operatic wailings without  batting an eyelash.<br />The only complaint is that guitarist Jim Martin, who  cemented his place in rock and roll history with one of the greatest guitar  solos ever on &quot;Epic&quot;, isn't nearly as effective here as he is on  &quot;The Real Thing&quot;. I can't believe the weak solo on &quot;Crack  Hitler&quot; ever made it close to the masters for this album.  Still, that  doesn't stop this album from being anything short of a masterpiece.
0553274503|5.0|I read this book for school when I was in 7th grade, and just finished re-reading it ten years and a degree in biology later.  I loved it when I  was a teen, and (after forcing myself to ignore my instinctive scientific  skepticism) still love it today.<br />It's a very thought-provoking story, all  the more so when you consider that it was written about 40 years ago when  society was a bit less tolerant of the mentally retarded than it is now.   Charlie is a man in his 30s with an IQ of 68 when the book starts; through  a controversial experimental operation, his IQ gets higher and higher until  it soars at one point to 185.  The story is told through the journal  entries that he is told to keep for the researchers in charge of the study.   Through Charlie's words, you can see how sharply his intellect grows and  how difficult it is for him because as smart as he becomes, his *emotional*  intelligence is still that of a child.  <br />Charlie's emergence from  ignorance is painful for him; imagine learning all of life's hard truth's  in a matter of weeks rather than the normal development from innocent child  to worldly adult.  And the ending of the book is heartwrenching.  Everyone  should read &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; at some point in their life.   It's a classic.
6303908306|5.0|My daughter told me about this movie after it was homaged in &quot;Scary  Movie.&quot;  She brought home the VHS for us to watch.  I was amazed.  You  have got to admire a screenplay and direction so intricate and  manipulative, and yet iron-clad in its finality.  I cannot find a flaw in  the plot or the presentation.  I was extremely entertained, so what more  can I say?
6305137293|3.0|&quot;Halloween II&quot; picks up directly at the end of the original  film, and sends survivor Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to the hospital  to nurse her wounds.  Unfortunately for her and most of the cast, Micheal  Myers follows.  Donald Pleasence and Nancy Stephens also reprise their  roles as well.Directed by Rick Rosenthal and scripted by John Carpenter and  Debra Hill, &quot;Halloween II&quot; is a very respectable sequel.  There  is a lot more blood and gore in this one (which came in the  post-&quot;Friday the 13th&quot; era), but unlike some of the later  sequels, this one still has that &quot;Halloween&quot; feel about it.  The  finale is also very tense and wraps up the story pretty well -- you could  view the original and this one without any of the other sequels and have a  complete story.The DVD is presented in 2.35:1 ratio and does not contain  any extras aside from some brief production notes.  But the movie is good,  and its a bargain price, so pick it up and make it a &quot;Halloween&quot;  night.

B000001I0Q|5.0|The sound on this cd is really good for being an early '80's cd. With all the famous hardcore punk bands with low quality production, this band  stands out strong. Whether you listnen to goth,punk,metal or any other  label, this is the band you want to listen to next if your hungry for  something new. THE LORDS OF THE NEW CHURCH cd is a great getaway from  whatever you're listening to now!  FIND IT, CRANK IT AND ENJOY!
0790731002|5.0|Okay, this isn't anything like Batman or the best Batman film, Batman Returns. It is like the James Bond films going from the serious, dark, ON  Her Majesty's secret service to the dazzling, colrful, witty diamonds Are  Forever. Batman Forever it fun, colorful, and action-packed. Two-Face and  the Riddler are great villains, and I love Val kilmer and and chris  o'donnel as Batman and robin. The sets are lavish and amazing, especially  Claw Island. Special effects and sound are amazing. Cinematography is  imaginative and interesting. The action scenes are crowd-pleasing and very  entertaining. Nicole Kidman is sexy, and the music and soundtrack are good.  Overall, very much worth seeing!
0691023565|5.0|Pardon the cliche, but: no home should be without this book.

This is to  problem solving what Strunk and White are to writing. BUY IT.  I've lost  track of my copy, and once I finish this review, I'll be replacing it.
0140434089|4.0|I thought The Moonstone was enjoyable until about the last quarter of the  book.  Forgive me, but my 21st century thinking couldn't reconcile the  opium story line.

B00004VWA2|4.0|This is designed for Sony's audiophile Super Audio CD player.  Sony maintains that SACDs will still work with standard CD players because they  have several layers of data, including a standard CD layer for those of us  who have standard CD players and not a $3,500 Super player. Please note  that the rating has nothing to do with the CD itself; I had to put  something in there!
B00004XPOZ|5.0|The reason the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies have held up for over 20 years is the way that George Lucas has created a brilliant world that a moviegoer  can disappear into.  Sure, sometimes the dialogue is a bit creaky, and the  characterizations can turn into Saturday morning cartoon bits, but when you  buy a soda and popcorn, and sit down.......the films take you away to  another galaxy, and you sometimes forget you're just watching another  &quot;flick.&quot;  As I get older, I still picture myself using a  lightsaber and leaping straight off platforms, I still picture myself  flying into the Death Star, and I sometimes wish I could use the Force to  mind-control indifferent friends......

B000002GEY|5.0|There aren't many albums that a person listens to &amp; enjoys every  single song on without feeling the urge to skip past this or that song, but  this album is one of those rare goodies for me.<br />Every single song is a  gem, and when I buy a new format of music (i.e., CD's when we changed from  vinyl) this is always the #1 first album I order.  I simply can't be  without it.  When I listen to these songs it takes me back to my senior  year of high school, staying up all night to type out my senior theme that  I had procrastinated too long on...while listening to this beautiful music  over &amp; over.  I remember driving aimlessly for hours just so I could  listen to it cranked up high without parents yelling to turn it down.  A  true classic that is like visiting an old dear friend.
B000023VR6|5.0|Wonderfully produced! Not all of the songs were amazing but the  bigger  portion of them was extremley good. If you don't approve of cuss words and  violence then don't buy the album! I bought it cause it had Eminem on it  who I love but after listening to it I loved it. Dre makes great albums  nothing more to say about that. Not exactly good for anyone under 13 but  hey thats why there is a Parental Advisory sticker on it. This is good hard  core rap.
B000001DTM|5.0|When joining the record clubs to get those 11 albums &quot;free&quot; to  build up my collection fast, this album is always among the first I get.  The lyrics are Soul-touching and have such a huge impact on me, especially  when reading along while the music plays.  (The lyrics to every song is  included) The singing ...WOW!!  Don't miss this album.  I'll never be  without it.
B000002KCI|5.0|Released in 1975, not that long after the classic Harvest, this album  shares the same downbeat mood though this time, the backing band were Crazy  Horse and not the Stray 'Gators. Thus, the musical style is more rock than  country.<br />This is a great album with no weak tracks at all. Dangerbird is  my favourite here. What a terrific song. It is one of Neil Young's best  ever efforts. More than that, it is one of the best rock ballads ever with  some superb guitar and bass licks.<br />Barstool Blues is another great song,  Neil's singing at its best and the classic Crazy Horse guitar sound is here  at its finest.<br />Cortez the Killer is perhaps the best known track on this  album and it too is a knockout song. Where Dangerbird was surreal and  Barstool Blues dealt with modern day angst, this song refers back to the  brutality of the Conquistadors.<br />Along with Harverst, this CD stands out  as the top of Neil Young's early years and it is essential part of any  collection of his work. If you particularly like this album then you will  surely be interested in some of his later work with Crazy Horse such as  Ragged Glory.
0425107469|4.0|This was a very fast paced well written book.  I was constantly on the  edge of my seat.  With the exception of the (sometimes) sappy love story  subplot I would give it five stars.
B000005HBI|5.0|If I compare the CD's Cassandra Wilson has released so far, in retrospect  this one is the best sounding and the most honest one. Listen to her  version of  \\"Come On In My Kitchen\\", a blues song also performed by The  Steve Miller Band on their CD \\"The Joker\\". Cassandra Wilson shows here the  same talent as Holly Cole, that is to internalize the song. Her voice is  rather demanding and often somewhat domineering, but you can also  experience here the phenomenon of her voice becoming an instrument under  instruments. According to me the best songs on this CD are: \\"Tell Me You'll  Wait For Me\\", \\"Hellhound On My Trail\\" (beautiful guitar accompaniment and a  grumbling cornet) and \\"I Can't Stand The Rain\\". These are strong songs with  little but adequate accompaniment and they sound like life performances,  which is rather a compliment in these days of sonic trash!
B0000062Y2|5.0|When this came out on broadway last year I was so excited to see it, but  after I saw it on the Tony awards the modernization of it drew me away.   This CD is remarkable.  Ted Neeley is terrific!  I judge my JCS recordings  by my favorite song &quot;I only wanted to say&quot;.  And Ted Neeley  rocks!  The entire cast is awesome!  This is the only recording to have!  I  also recommend to have the movie to go with it!
B000005EJL|3.0|First of all, I think most of the lyrics on this CD are too cheap to be true. All cliches are used, and feed my suspicion to guess that the  songwriters lacked inspiration, to say the least. The rhythm is okay, but  the rime is lousy. Moreover, there's a tendency of tawdriness in all  arrangements, the jingling little organ, the harmonica of Toots Thielemans,  the awful synthesizer in the background for lack of decent accompaniment of  strings (which is often almost as bad). The nice thing though, is the  ironic use of musical styles, every dancestep comes along and if you listen  to it you can't help grinning, at least there's some inventiveness here.  The number \\"Some things never change\\" is one of the better on this CD.  It  bears reminiscence to former Supertramp songs, there's change of rhythm,  and there's a nice flutesolo, plus a nice guitarsolo, rather hypnotizing  drums, some of the ingredients former Supertramp work made so irresistible.  The only thing I miss is the use of a real piano. The trumpets at the end  are superb.<br />The overall impression: rather nice popsongs, but a lack of  inspiration causes no real surprises. The HCDC recording is very good,  although a bit loud in parts.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I agree with everyone who had reviewed this recording.  It is the only one to have a listen to over and over again!  I heard the 1996 London Cast and  they're not too bad, but this blows it away!  Ted Neeley is remarkable!   Being a loyal Lloyd Webber fan you've got to get this!  (better than the  current cast in NYC).  Happy Listening!
B000002MTR|5.0|This is a mindblowing album, easily pepper's best work. This album has  given the band great recognition and respect in the hard rock world,  although dissapointed the mainstream following with it's hard rock attitude  and Navarro's heavy guitaring. Still, having said that it still has the  catchy, memorable songs that all previous pepper's albums have in  abundance. Antony's golden voice is at it's usual best and anyone who says  this is a poor CD has absolutely no taste. The best song is the single 'My  Freinds', a slow, mellow yet passionate song-- an absolute classic.  'Aeroplane' was the hit single and although it is a great, upbeat and well  produced song, it is a nightmare it's so catchy. It could just stay stuck  inside your head for days. 'Coffee Shop' is one of those heavier,  Navarro-styled songs and it is breathtaking. The band make no secret of  where the song's influences lie with the line ''Meet me at the coffee shop,  so we can dance like Iggy Pop''. 'One big mob' is a rave song with Antony's  vocals amazing.'Walkabout' is a really cool tune and provides for rap  lovers. 'Tearjerker' is a slow love song and is one of the finest songs on  the album. 'One Hot Minute' is the heaviest song on the album and dosen't  dissapoint. A great pop song on the album is 'Falling into Grace'.  'Trancending' is another  mindblowing epic on a great album. Soundgarden  fans stand up and take notice to the greatest rock band in the world.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I had purchased the original London cast recording, and after I heard it I was not too happy.  I compare recordings by my favorite song  &quot;Gethsemane (I Only Wanted to Say)&quot;.  I was so disgusted that I  gave it away to my cousin and bought this album!  ;)
B000002572|5.0|I'm a musician myself.  I play keyboard, guitar, and harmonica..If I had a  choice of only one record...Yes record, I have Boston in LP format....I  could keep, this would be the one.  Brad Delp is a great vocalist and I  love the sustained power guitars through the whole album.  I don't think  people give the rest of Boston's albums/cd's a fair shake though.  I loved  Third Stage too...Especially the Takeoff...The walls shake in my room on my  system when I play it.  Boston rules man!<br />Peace,<br />Mike.
B000002N2Z|5.0|I love this album. The Deftones are without a shadow of a doubt my  favorite band. They create music unlike any other band out there and  everytime I buy a Deftones album I know that I will not be dissapointed  because they rock so much. I have had this album for awhile and I have had  many opportunities to listen to it. I wouldn't say that this is the best  Deftones album, but it is just as good as all of their others. Adrenaline  has some rockin songs on it including Engine No. 9(My personal favorite), 7  Words, Bored, Minus Blindfold, Root, Lifter, and Nosebleed. This is a must  have for all Deftones fans and for any fan of hardcore music.
B000003BF1|5.0|By 1969,the Rolling Stones were starting a new chapter in their  career.Brian Jones was quietly asked to leave,and 21 year old blues prodigy  Mick Taylor was asked to be his replacement.The resulting album,LET IT  BLEED(a parody of the Beatles' LET IT BE) charted the course that the  Stones would take for the seventies and early eighties.Not only was the  blues rock of BEGGARS BANQUET conitnued(check out MIDNIGHT RAMBLER,GIMMIE  SHELTER and the Robert Johnson cover,LOVE IN VAIN);but the new found  friendship of Keith Richard and ex-Byrd Gram Parsons added a country tinge  to the proceedings(on the tracks YOU GOT THE SILVER,LET IT BLEED,and  COUNTRY HONK).LET IT BLEED is the final album that has Brian Jones playing  on some tracks;however this is Keith's album.Many critics hve accused Keith  Richard of copying Chuck Berry's riffs,but LET IT BLEED places him in the  top ten guitarists of all time.The emotion Keith gets out of his axe on  this release is just breathtaking.Mick Taylor is a fine replacement for  Jones,as his static electricity performance on LIVE WITH ME and the  single,HONKY TONK WOMEN.Jagger has never sounded better and really gets  into the heart of the lyrics. Charlie Watts never stops showing why he is  one of rock's top drummers(the cowbell intro to HONKY TONK WOMEN is  legendary). Nicky Hopkins paints aural pictures with his piano.Also,I can't  forget the work of Ry Cooder,Merry Clayton,and Ian Stewart.I will go so far  as to say there is not one duff track on LET IT BLEED; just when you think  you can take no more,you are transported  skyward by the gospel rave up of  YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT.Jimmy Miller produces his second Stones  classic(he would go on to produce three more).If you want to get to the  true heart of the Rolling Stones,get a copy of LET IT BLEED.
B0000024SI|5.0|This album is simply fantastic. But I wasn't quite sure when I first listened.........I at firstwondered why this was considered better than the  later &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot;. But nowI love it and grasp its  importance. One of the reasons I didn't like it was that I was tryingtoo  hard to figure out what the songs ment, but what I know realize is that  there isn't justone meaning for the songs. The meanings came naturally to  me after I took time tocomfortably absorb it.I was at first turned off by  lines like &quot;the sun's not yellow, its chicken&quot;, but that  particularline I believe was in there to trick the listener. I think he's  using the 'definition' of chickenthat children use to indicate a lack of  bravery, like they do 'scardy cat'; it makes sensebecause the  commander-in-chief that says that in the song is a kind of barbaric  characterwho thinks he can conquer all(death to all that should whimper and  cry). Yellow may alsobe being used in the coward sense. I think this is a  good and rather obvious explanation ofthat stanza. &quot;Ballad Of A  Thin Man&quot;, while chilling, took a while for me to like as well.  Thelyrics, while not always flowing perfectly, are quite interesting. I'm  not sure if the titlerefers to being physically thin or thin as pertaining  to some personality traits. Mr. Jones isa well-educated wealthy man who is  one of the many nuisances to society &amp; perhapspersonally to Bob Dylan,  someone that would fit quite well in the amazing &quot;Like A  RollingStone&quot;. He may be lonely, but he definatly isn't quite aware of  exactly what he sees, whichothers may possibly use to harm him (think of  when the sword-swallower gives him backhis throat). Perhaps the only way he  stays alive is because people he knows help him(thelumberjacks get him his  facts...Dylan may have used lumberjack either because they workharder than  Jones does or he used it to exaggerate just how lost Jones is). There are  evenmore details about mr. jones, but i think I'll just leave it at  that.And finally, the song that people curse and praise at the same time  for the same reasons.That's right, it's &quot;Desolation Row&quot;.This is  a hard song to dissect, but I'll give a very brief synopsis. This is  obviously about aplace...what or where exactly this place is may be up to  the listener, but it's obviously aplace of isolation. He may be talking  about what America was becoming, already was, orin the end became. I often  wonder if it's where social outcasts go---Einstein disguised asRobin Hood  may be just that. It's important to point out that not everyone in the song  isfrom there---some are going there, overlooking it, etc. I sometimes think  the song has amessage similar to &quot;Gates Of Eden&quot;, telling not of  what a place like America is but ratherwhat it is not.........this is  fueled by lines like&quot;And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing,  he'sgetting ready for the show, He's going to the carnival tonight on  Desolation Row&quot;---thatcould mean that all the truely good people are  hard to come by and perhaps ultimatelywasted. Anyway, what I'm ultimately  trying to say is MOST DYLAN SONGS,INCLUDING THE ONES ON THIS ALBUM DON'T  HAVE TO HAVE JUST ONEMEANING.........NOT EVERY LINE HAS TO HAVE AN EXACT  MEANING;DYLAN OFTEN PUTS WORDS OR PHRASES IN SIMPLY BECAUSE HE LIKESHOW IT  FITS IN THE SONG, AND ALSO JUST IMPROVISES---VERY WELL!  Okay, that's  just about all for this review....actually I was mostly defending thisalbum  from the people that gave the album less than five stars. I urge anyone  whoconsiders themselves a music fan to at least give this and other Dylan  albums a good try,perhaps starting with &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; to  get a good feel for Dylan. Then perhapsskip down to &quot;Bringing It All  Back Home&quot;.....I think his will help prepare the listener forthe  raw-edged ways of  &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;. The sound is still  very natural &amp; I loveKooper?sorgan playing...it's amazing that someone  who had no previous experience withan organ played thatperfectly. I  understand there are those that for some reason may never like Dylan, but  atleast respect him for his towering significance. I don't the Rolling  Stones much but I don'tgo around cursing them, so in the same vein of  reasoning don't just wander about your lifecalling this album a waste of  money &amp; telling them to go buy the Beatles' WhiteAlbum(still, a fine  album).......doing so will drive you into the dark but very real world  ofmystery tramps, napoleons in rags, one-eyed midgets, and dr.  filth.........
B0000248L1|5.0|The first album of Canadian Annihilator and definitely their best!  Mind-blasting songs like &quot;Alison Hell&quot;, &quot;Welcome to your  death&quot; and dark - schizophrenic songs like &quot;Ligeia&quot;,  &quot;Human Insecticide&quot; are going to haunt your brain!
B000002GD8|4.0|When discussing Supertramp, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; and  &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; are usually mentioned as this group's best  efforts -- &quot;Breakfast&quot; certainly wins by virtue of sales, while  &quot;Crime&quot; gets the nod for its rich, dense, art-rock sound. It's a  shame that &quot;Crisis&quot; doesn't get more attention. Sure, it lacked a  radio hit, but it's a great listen from start to finish, continuing (and  perhaps even exceeding at times) where &quot;Crime&quot; left off. There's  a full range of emotions here, marred perhaps by &quot;The Meaning&quot;  which was positioned right at the climax of the album. Standouts include  &quot;Ain't Nobody But Me,&quot; which builds wonderfully and dissolves  into &quot;A Soapbox Opera;&quot; &quot;Lady,&quot; sounding very much like  the album's hit single with its similarity to &quot;Dreamer&quot; from  &quot;Crime;&quot; and &quot;Poor Boy.&quot; There really isn't a dull  moment here. If you own and enjoy any Supertramp albums, you should own  this one as well -- it stands head-and-shoulders among their best and keeps  rewarding after repeated listenings. It's a personal favorite as well.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|Jeez, what can you really say about this movie? I was told advance word on  this was fantastic.  Every person I knew had seen an advance screening of  it assured me that it was a brilliant film, and they were dead right. U-571  tells the story of an American manned submarine on it's way to retrieve the  Engima message coding device from the nazis. One of the nazi subs with this  machine on it, has just been attacked &amp; disabled.  Through a  intercepted message to Germany, the Americans pinpoint the location, &amp;  head out to pick up the machine. Suffice to say, things do not go to plan,  and the American crew, near obliterated by nazi fire, are stranded on the  enemy sub, where everything is written in german, and no way to get back  home, without coming under fire from their own men. Matthew McConaughey is  brilliant in this movie, a true action hero.  It really makes you wonder  why he isn't used more in this type of film. Bill Paxton - I've been a big  fan of his for a long time, and it's a shame that he isn't used as much as  he could be here.  But that said, what he does do is worth watching. Harvey  Keitel - Looking like Mario from Super Mario Bros., Keitel as always does a  great job.<br />Buy it!  Buy it now! You will not be disappointed, you will be  rocked!
0440217563|2.0|I wouldn't buy it. I'm glad that I only bought the hardcover edition at barnes and nobles for 5 books. It was slow, dumb, and quit boring. The only  good book in the series was Dragonfly in Amber. Here, in this book, it is  slow and repetitive. Yawn.
B000031XCR|5.0|Frankly, i have to admit that i have never heard a more beautiful voice  than Celine's.  I have been reading the bad review's about Celine and i  find them rather nauseating myself. It is an honor to own all of Celine's  CD's I especially like this CD, All the Way.  I love her duet with Frank  Sinatra and i know there's no one who can sing a duet better.  So what, if  some of the songs aren't in this CD go out and buy her other CD that  contains your favorite song.  Celine is remarkable in singing, personality  and always having time for her fans.  So tell me what other singer is like  that. So sit back an enjoy this CD and stop being so jealous of this  talented woman.

630588255X|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films and one that I watch often. I  was pleased to hear that it was being released on DVD and it looks great.  This movie will certainly not be for every taste but I have always found it  hilarious. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are excellent, of course, but my  favorite in the film is Vivian Pickles as Harold's mother. For fans of high  camp, her performance is a treat. The dvd offers no special features,  except for trailers, which is a shame. Still, this one is a must have!
B000002VMH|4.0|Ignore the critics who say she has not earned her title to be a diva. I have to disagree she has been around for over a decade and has put out an  amazing string of pop hits. She has more than earned her title. This album  is heavy on ballad songs that fit her voice. My favorite is the midtempo  &quot;Walkin on broken glass&quot; Which is an infectious melody noone can  resist. In this current age of fake divas who havent even been around for  that long its time that Annie Lennox gets the spotlight. She should be on  the next Vh1 Divas Live show.
6305751706|4.0|The movie &quot;Gothic&quot; is not nearly as awful as some reviewers here have represented.  Russel more or less puts the viewer in the minds of the  characters as they experience drug induced hallucinations and whip  themselves into a climactic frenzy.  If you can accept this frame of  reference, you can enjoy the disjointedness and wierdness of this film.   Both Byrne and Sands are excellent as the two poets, although Richardson is  fairly wooden in her role.  There is some poor editing, particularly  towards the end, and some unexplained shots that require knowledge about  the actual characters (especially Lord Byron). However, the film does a  good job of conveying the goings-on of a crazy night at Byron's swiss  chalet.  In short, Gothic is a fairly wild (and short) ride that has to be  approached with an open mind in order to enjoy.
B0000027RL|5.0|While many fans of the newer, more &quot;toned-down&quot; and less  commercial Pearl Jam (I count myself one of these, btw) may decrie Ten as  simply mainstream, radio-friendly anthems for the masses, this album stands  undeniably as one of the best albums of the 90s. From Once and Evenflow to  the more laid-back (and still wonderful) Black, the album is absolutely  tremendous. The often-underrated second half of the album deserves credit  also in that it foreshadows the greater complexity found in PJ's later  records. Fans of Binaural &amp; No Code (again, I am one) may want to deny  it, but Ten is most likely what inspired them to follow the career of PJ  amd is truly one of the band's strongest albums.
B000001EQT|5.0|The Slider is great. The lyrics are silly, the music is mostly energetic.  &quot;Chariot Choogle&quot; has a fantastically dark guitar part.  &quot;Cadillac&quot; is a fun song and an essential bonus track.  &quot;Ballrooms of Mars&quot; is another song that I must mention. 5 stars  to good-hearted rock n roll.
B0000203YT|4.0|I am not an avid reader of Shakespeare's tales for fear of being bombarded  by verbose prose, but SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE directed by John Madden is simply  a lush tale of twisted love which is accessible and is bolstered by staunch  performance from Gwyneth Paltrow who deservingly won a Best Actress for her  role as Viola and the smouldering Joseph Fiennes as Will. It tells how Will  scripted Romeo and Juliet and the delighful comedy spirals in when Viola  dressed herself as a man for the role of Romeo. She yearns to break free of  the shackles from her loveless marriage with Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) and  march to the exuberance of the reel life by getting herself the part. There  lies the beautiful poetic imagery that heightens the intensity of their  passion - cutting and excruciating - even I am touched by the desperation,  the madness of their love. It is a comedy, but it does not extract itself  from the realities - the couple must face their separation with courage,  beliving love is not a transient thing but a commitment. <br />The great  supporting cast of Judi Dench, who holds up the majesty as the Queen,  Geoffrey Rush and Ben Affleck is suitably buoyant. The story offers a  tantalizing history of how his work came by and sometimes it is even hard  to distinguish between fiction and truth. Ultimately, the love story is one  of wits, of passion and love - and we herald willingly long live the Bard.  The film is fantastic - but I do wish the ending would not be that abrupt -  although it does serve well.
B000000H4V|5.0|There are four classic sepultura albums, those being arise, beneath the reamains, roots and chaos a.d.. For the thrashers the choice pic is either  arise or beneath the reamains, for the trendies who just happened to come  across sepultura or heard Jonathan davis was on the record it's roots. I  find myself unappealed my the kornish work of roots and although arise and  beneath the remains are great cd's chaos a.d. is my personal favorite. Some  of the all time sepultura classics are on this disc, including slave new  world, refuse/resist, amen, propaganda, biotech is godzilla, clench fist,  territory, and nomad. Sepulutura are flawless on this album, the political  lyrics, the deep growls of max, the great guitars by andreas, and drums of  igor. This is where i feel sepultura reached thier musical hight and  released an all time classic.
0897500482|5.0|This si by far the best book i have ever read this is the book that got  bruce famous. If you are looking for a good work out and how to take down  people or minipulate them in many ways this is the book for you i have  learned many things from this book i recomend it with all my heart u wont  be sorry u bought it
B00003CXDG|2.0|This is a example of how special effects has been taking over films rather than acting. Don't get me wrong i love big budget action scenes but it  helps to have a plot. Its clear that the plot has been written to fit  around the action sequences not vice versa. Lets hope there is no M:I3
0792839234|5.0|Phantasm (1979)<br />Phantasm is a cult classic worldwide that spawned three  sequels and has many &quot;Phans&quot;.<br />The story is highly creative and  original.13-year old Michael Pearson (Michael Baldwin) spies on a funeral  and notices a creepy tall mortician known as &quot;The Tall Man&quot;  (Angus Scrimm) lift up a casket all by himself and load it into a  hearse.<br />Mike does some investigating and along the way meets plenty of  nasty baddies.Hooded midget monks,the now infamous flying silver killer  spheres,and &quot;The Tall Man&quot; himself.  <br />The film has a lot of  defintions of horror,and very powerful ones at that.The music score is  absolutely brilliant and fits in perfectly.Angus Scrimm does a wonderful  job as &quot;The Tall Man&quot; and the special effects are actually very  good.The sphere scene is unforgettable,the car chases are splendid,and the  gore effects  are superb.<br />This film is also extremely frightening,and  will surely give you nightmares if your very young or sensitive.Out of all  four Phantasm films,this ties with Phantasm II as the best of the   series.Buy this and Phantasm II.The other two entries in the   series,Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead and Phantasm: OblIVion, are watchable  and very well done,but just can't hold a torch to this and the epic  sequel.<br />REAL horror fans HAVE to have this in their collection,along with  Phantasm II.
6303187064|5.0|This film represents a complete film full of everything necessary for a  great film.  There is love, violence, action, revenge, and of course  trajedy.  A masterpiece.
B00004STPT|5.0|Possibly the best soundtrack from possibly the best movie I have ever  watched.  Before seeing the movie, I had seen some previews in which the  battle scenes had been set to &quot;Bawitiba&quot; by Kid Rock and I was  incredibly dissapointed.  However, once I saw the movie, I was blown away  and bought the soundtrack that night.  While there is some dead space in  the middle, tracks 3,9,10,11,15-17 more than make up for it.  Like any good  soundtrack, listening to it brings back the movie in your mind and can  almost play back certain scenes.  I great work.
6304259093|1.0|This movie is a complete insult to Brandon Lee who starred and died in the  making of The Crow.  The main character is a wimp.  He is scrawny and not  very intimidating.  This movie is a complete insult to the original and  should not even be associated with The Crow.  Do not buy it!  Do not even  bother watching it!
0783229569|5.0|...&quot;Fear and Loathing&quot; IS best when viewed under chemical  influence. How else could one watch this film righteously?  I haven't tried  watching it with a head full of acid, mescaline, or ether, but I have  watched it after having far too many Jim Beam-Cokes.  It's amazing how much  easier it is to follow along with the film after chemically altering your  perception of things.   If you haven't seen the film yet, READ THE BOOK  FIRST.  Terry Gilliam is a genius, but even HE can't quite do the book  justice.
067972768X|1.0|Out of the many books I have read I would consider this the most confusing  and mind-bending. I expected the second section of the novel (Scar), to be  a continuation of the first part (The Joy Luck Club). Half way through  reading it I asked myself &quot;What in the WORLD is going on??&quot; The  book is somewhat difficult to follow. Sorry Amy, but that's the truth!
B000001FS3|5.0|There is yet simply one minor thing to be said about this cd, the one  thing which matters.  You have not TRULY EXPERIENCED the beauty of this  album unless you have driven underneath a desert sky out on a lonesome  highway, really blasting this on the stereo. (can you imagine listening to  &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; without being able to yell  along)  So. You are going at least 90mph, your windows are rolled down,  your hair is wild - and your feeling? Sheer and utter ecstasy...
0792835700|4.0|Although it may not be the most realistic film, I really enjoyed this  musical.  The first time I ever saw it was in in January 1980 when I was  only 8 years old .  My grandfather and I watched it and I have cherished it  since.  I think it is a good story showing that love crosses all  boundaries.
0767817478|1.0|If I could give this movie a rating of 0 stars, I would. Boy was I  dissapointed. The trailers were awesome, I thought this would be all the  fun of the cheesy Japenese movies and all of the glittering special effects  of Hollywood rolled into 1 fun package. Unfortunately, the writing wasn't  so much a script as it was a collection of one-liners and cliches stolen  from other movies, the &quot;love&quot; scenes and others were so strained  it was clear even the actors weren't into it, and the effects seemed like  someone had lifted all the footage from Jurassic park and ran it through a  bumpy skin filter.<br />If you are a godzilla fan like me, I recommend  catching the trailer and passing on the actual movie.
630407185X|5.0|Perhaps one of the best &quot;classic&quot; World War II films ever.   Ranks up there with &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, &quot;The Great  Escape&quot;, &quot;The Big Red One&quot; and other fact-based movies.   However, the movie is like a fictional drama in that the story moves  quickly and keeps the viewer's interest throughout.  It's a long one...so  bring lots of pop corn and soda to the TV area!  Highly recommended for  those who enjoyed &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and other more recent  WWII movies too.
B000002LB6|5.0|Erasure, the English synth-pop duo of Vince Clarke (ex-Depeche Mode and  Yaz) and newcomer Andy Bell, debuted in 1986 with &quot;Wonderland,&quot;  an enjoyable, though spotty, collection of simple, danceable pop songs.  With &quot;Wonderland,&quot; despite many brilliant highlights, Erasure was  still finding its voice and the Clarke-Bell songwriting team was still in  its earliest stages (Bell's only contribution to &quot;Oh L'amour&quot; was  the title and a couple of the album's other songs were written entirely by  Clarke).  But by &quot;The Circus,&quot; the partnership had solidified and  Erasure's forte was clear: writing melodic, hook-laden pop songs devoid of  the angst or gloom so characteristic of other '80s synth-pop bands.  On  &quot;The Circus,&quot; everything clicked, and the songwriting was among  their most consistent.  &quot;Hideaway,&quot; &quot;Don't Dance,&quot;  &quot;Victim of Love,&quot; &quot;The Circus,&quot; &quot;It Doesn't Have  to Be&quot; and (of course) &quot;Sometimes&quot;--where is there another  album released in the '80s so full of intelligent, finely crafted,  brilliantly arranged pop songs?  I can't think of one.  Alas, the boys  would follow up with 1988's dreadfully inconsistent &quot;The  Innocents&quot; and 1989's OK &quot;Wild!&quot; before going on to make  their finest records in the '90s.  But if you want an early Erasure album  that sounds like a greatest hits collection, buy &quot;The Circus.&quot;
6304935811|5.0|Gritty, awesome, scary...and he was on our side!<br />Highly recommended  &quot;biographical-drama&quot; for any World War II buff.  George C. Scott  does an excellent job portraying one of the most enigmatic American heroes  of WW2.
B000000OAN|4.0|I bought this album hoping it would be as good as the other Queen albums I  got, and thankfully it was.  I love the first song, &quot;Death on two legs  (dedicated to...&quot;, it is a great rock song.  &quot;Laxing on a Sunday  Afternoon&quot;  is short but sweet.  I think I would probably like  &quot;I'm in Love With My Car&quot; even better (if it is possible) if it  was sung by Freddie.  I'm just used to Freddie's beautiful voice singing  all the great songs.  &quot;You're My Best Friend&quot; is a great classic  that I already have. I'm sorry I can't say the same for &quot;'39&quot;, I  don't like it.  &quot;Sweet Lady&quot; is an average song by Queen, so it  is great!  &quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot; is, um, interesting.  &quot;The  Prophet's Song&quot; is a great long song that really rewards the patient  listener with some good rock at the end.  &quot;Love of My Life&quot; is a  breath taking love ballad that I think everybody would love if they  listened to it.  &quot;Good Company&quot; is by Brian May so that already  says it is great.  Now, everybody knows &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; so  that doesn't even need anything said about it except-amazing.  &quot;God  Save the Queen&quot; is a Queen version of the classic tune that everyone  hums while in London.  Wrapping things up, a great cd, the only reason I  give it four stars is because of &quot;'39&quot; and the wierd parts of  &quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot;.  I would recommend this album to anybody  who is even remotely interested in Queen
B000009QPG|5.0|Good heavens, where to start. This album is nothing short of a masterpiece  in rock history. Metallica only wishes they were this intense.<br />Things get  off to a fine start with &quot;War Ensemble,&quot; a thrashing, merciless  rocker that bores its way into your skull for five loud, loud, loud  minutes. The riffs sound like machine gun fire from a war film, the drums  never let up, and Tom Araya's screaming makes Metallica's James Hetfield  sound like Julie Andrews. I could listen to this song every hour of every  day and I would never stop being blown away by it. It's a brilliant piece  of metal and it sets the stage for the pounding nine songs that follow.  Need I mention that not one is a ballad?<br />I consider &quot;Seasons in the  Abyss&quot; to be Slayer's masterpiece, which is saying something when you  realize that this is the band that revolutionized thrash metal with  &quot;Reign in Blood.&quot; &quot;RiB&quot; is fantastic, no argument here,  but &quot;Seasons&quot; is better; the songs are more complex, the  songwriting a step above, the overall impact more devastating.<br />If you  think you like heavy music, by all means get this album. This is the gold  standard right here.

Jonas just left that space and found the  real world. Also it might interest you that there are colored lights and  singing, and Jonas left right before December, It could very well be  Christmas. I would like the think that Jonas will go to expirience the  memory that was the givers favorite, the one that taught Jonas about love.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I noticed a lot of 1 star reviews but those are people who don't like rap.  This is offensive yes but that's how Eminem is, you should known that! He  raps and insults people! He takes a drop of anger and turns it into an  ocean it just makes it funny! If you don't like it then he's just not for  you plain and simple. But don't dis him 'cause many of us do love him!
B000001GQB|5.0|With classical music it's often very hard, even impossible, to get out of the shadow of the first interpretation of a piece that you ever heard.   Particularly if that version was an excellent one, it will always be  imprinted on your brain as the &quot;best&quot; version.  Yet this set of  Mozart's last symphonies by Karl Bohm and the Berliner Philharmoniker  actually made me forget about Marriner and Walter, at least for a while.   Vibrant, convincing, moving performances, in fact, you might say altogether  persuasive.  And this 2-CD set is a steal for the price.
B000001FY5|5.0|this album shows all of which is good from bob marley from his uptempo  waiting in vain and to what i think is his best song of this album a  romantic slow and secluded &quot;Turn your lights down low&quot;. New fans  will apreciate this album as it shows marley as both political and romantic
B00003CXFV|5.0|This is Julia Robert's best role yet. Fueled by a great story and superb acting from Albert Finney, this film delivers on all fronts. Most enjoyable  are the sparks that fly between Roberts and Finney. Sharp,witty dialogue  between the two makes the film worth watching in itself. For me character  is everything and in this film Roberts plays it for all it's worth.  Brokovich is a multi-layered character combining a sassy chutzpah with a  good heart and a sharp mind. A superb job. Deserves an Oscar nod for both  Roberts and Finney.
630587493X|5.0|In this movie, a family of the near future purchases a robot(Robin  William's character, Andrew) to help out with the housework (a very nice  idea, right)?  Only THIS robot wants to be viewed as more than just another  household appliance!  This robot can actually think for himself!  He also  displays amazing intelligence, empathy, and creativity.  We travel furthur  into the future (200 years, to be exact!) as we follow Andrew's quest to  become a REAL human being!  This very intriguing plot creates a most unique  movie.  How to categorize this movie is difficult. Is it a comedy?  Is it a  drama?  Is it romantic science fiction (if there even is such a category)?   Perhaps this is what makes Bicentennial Man so unique!  There's a lot more  to it than just:  How do you make a hankie dance?  Put a little boogie in  it!  There are some very touching emotional parts, so be prepared to have  your own hankie handy!  Give this movie a try; it's definitely worth  viewing!  (Everyone says this movie is NOT for children, yet my five year  old daughter absolutely adores it!  Yes, we had to do a lot of explaining  at times, but she definitely got the gist of the plot.  As a matter of  fact, she wants me to add that &quot;little Miss&quot; (The Pepsi Girl) is  her favorite character)!
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 is unparalleled at creating images from their sounds, and this album is  probably the absolute best of their attempts. In some ways its sad that  none of their other albums were ever able to truly capture all this album  had though some of them came close &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; in particular.  Though that has a completely different sound to it.<br />This is an absolute  great album, I bought it mainly because though I have so many of these  songs already on the greatest hits collection I still wanted to get the  feel of the whole album and it is definitely worth it. This album really  works together to create a feeling and mood of being that I have never  really felt with any other album.<br />I love this album because of the  pictures and images it conjures up. It's actually one of the songs that  doesn't receive much airplay that works the best for me. &quot;In God's  Country&quot; is just a great poem in some ways, but everytime I hear it I  just visualize myself walking along through this wood path when I was a Boy  Scout and coming out upon a meadow that was atop of a small plateau from  there I could see out across a valley. That is the kind of detailed imagery  that this song and the rest of this album bring to mind.<br />Of course there  are the other great songs on this album. &quot;Where The Streets Have No  Name&quot; could be a modern classic in and of itself and will be heard for  years to come. &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;  reminds us all that life is a search and that everytime we get caught up in  the details and unpleasantness of life we have to look ahead to what we're  truly aiming for. &quot;With or Without You&quot; is a great song, in many  ways emotionally tearing. And what I believe to be one of the most  emotional songs on this CD is &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; which was  supposedly written in part because of a friend's death.<br />If you like this  CD I would also recommend War which is another good early U2 CD. Achtung  Baby is good but has a completely different, much more modern sound.<br />All  in all, I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes modern rock music.Achtung  Baby is good but has a completely different, much more modern sound.<br />All  in all, I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes modern rock music.
B00003CWL6|5.0|AMERICAN BEAUTY! American Beauty is a winner for a life time. After  reading some of the other reviews, I would have to agree with all of them.  The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't really paying much attention. As  the movie progressed, I just got mad when people were talking when walking  into the living room. My friend's mother thought this was equivelant to a  porn movie, but it is so much more! It has so much beauty in it. It is  really an amazing movie. Since it is already out of the theatres, I would  definately agree that this a movie to BUY!
B000001GPX|5.0|I must agree with the consensus: This IS the definitive modern recording  of Beethoven's 5th.  The opportunity to have a copy without distracting  suface noise is not to be missed.  (Surface noise is perfectly acceptable  on old jazz 78's, but with classical it's anathema.)  Add to this the  welcome news that this is (for a CD) budget-priced, AND that they tossed in  Kleiber's version of the 7th, and it becomes well-nigh irresistable.  This  is one of the great classical music bargains on the market.  Take it from  one who has two vinyl copies of the Kleiber 5th, and also a CD with JUST  the 5th.  If you get this, you're sitting pretty.
0913022101|5.0|Definently an interesting work, a glimpse into the mind of the man who brought nazi-germany to power, and his plans for the world. The third  reich's campaign brought the nazis to a war the would engulf the entire  globe, and bring death to over 35 million worldwide. I would highly  recommend history-buffs like myself, and anyone who has a particular  interest in wwII or Nazi Germany to read this book, it brings to  perspective hitler's plans for the world, and a slight peek at the  character behind the leader of the third reich that will never be  forgotten.
B000002J09|1.0|Ok first off I'm not a Zeppelin hater, Zeppelin 2 is one of my favorite albums of all time, and I think everyone should own it. I also love the work they did after this album with Houses of the Holy and Physical  Graffiti.  But this album is so bad it makes me sick.  The people who wrote  these reviews giving this album 5 stars are either... or totally  consumed with the image brought on by the name of the band.  Not everything  this band recorded was good, no matter what their millions of worshipers  say.  And nothing proves that point more than listening to this album.  So  if you're looking for a Zeppelin album I suggest buying either Houses of  the Holy or Led Zeppelin 2. But no matter what you do leave this piece of  trash on the shelf because trust me you will be disappointed.
0201633612|5.0|Definitely the best book on object oriented design. Need some knowledge of  the OO paradigm and some previous experience to be really appreciated.
0385484518|1.0|The success of this book and the many gushing, syrupy reviews here just go  to show how far the dumbing-down of North American society has gotten,  more's the pity. Emotion is the highest good, and the reviewers who say  that this book is a cut above most things out there are unwittingly  revealing how gullible, mushy and anti-intellectual they really are--do  they ever read anything challenging, or just pap like this? Does the book  say something valuable? Is it written with talent and verve? Can we discuss  it on an intellectual level? Nah, let's concentrate on all the gooey  emotions it conjures up. Shame on all of you.
B000001Y5X|5.0|Portrait Of An American Family is one of the best debut albums I've ever  heard, and an excellent album in it's own right. The theme and references  to Willy Wonka are priceless, and the music and lyrical content is very  deep, as with all other Manson albums.<br />Perhaps Portrait's most redeeming  factor is its humor and the fact that it's extremely catchy. That's not to  say this album isn't serious. Manson has a lot to say here, and he  expresses it well. As with all of his works, Portrait concentrates on a  subject and sticks with it. I highly recommend this album to new and old  fans of Marilyn Manson alike. It's one of his best works to date, and it  provides timeless entertainment and humor.
B00004TJTS|5.0|Ok, so no sooner than you try to gulp that lump down your throat and along  comes a bigger one.  This movie is what America was and may never be again.  It is refreshing to see a young boy grow into his own and become a  successful writer in spite of the difficulties he encounters along the way.  I feel that Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane were excellent as the parents of  young Willie (Frankie Muniz).  See this movie with a loved one as I did.  My 7 year old daughter,my wife and I sat with tears rolling down our cheeks  as the final credits scrolled by...then we watched it again!! Wonderful  movie that is worth buying.  You will watch this one again and again.
B00004TJTS|5.0|By no means is &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; a perfect film. There are several  segments that are ridiculously far fetched, the theme of race is only  slightly touched on, and certain characters appear cliched and flawed.  Having said that, however, I can rightfully say now that anyone who does  not admit to even remotely liking this movie is an absolute fuddy-duddie!   This brilliantly executed film touches on so many emotional levels that I  not only found myself laughing throughout much of the story, but crying  throughout the movie's final sequence. &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; is not your  run of the mill family flick about a boy and his dog. It is instead a  beautiful, if not heartbreaking, eulogy to childhood, innocence, and an era  of America's past that is sadly lost forever. Though several reviewers have  argued otherwise, I found that &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; never fell into a  trap of sentimentality due to its honesty and truth. Towards the picture's  end, for instance, when the narrator asks &quot;Why in childhood do we wish  time to pass so quickly, when in adulthood we wish just the opposite?&quot;  I felt as if I had been hit by a ton of bricks. <br />I recommend this film to  anyone interested in nursing their inner child, for to watch this movie is  to embark on a journey into ones past. To the filmgoer who is willing to  dismiss cynicism and simply sit back and enjoy this gem of a picture,  &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; will undoubtedly conjure up a plethora of memories,  both painful, and cherished. <br />As you might guess, I flat out loved this  movie, and cannot say enough good things about it. Therefore, I make no  apologies for giving this movie 5 stars.
B00004SCX6|1.0|OK, this is just sad that anyone would want to listen to this!  Britney's nothing more than a model who they thought they could teach how to sing!  She doesn't even write her own music!  I assure you that you're wasting  your money if you buy it.  Oops!...I did it again is even worse than Baby  One More Time.  I still can't believe she stole the awesome song,  Satisfaction from the Rolling Stones.  If she's going to redo a legendary  song like that, why not at least put some feeling into it, if possible? I'm  sorry if I'm harsh, but I personally don't believe that Britney deserves to  have her so-called &quot;music&quot; on the market.

B00000064E|5.0|I am a recent fan of Nick Drake and came across him entirely by accident.  I remember being completely wooed by the VW commercial with Pink Moon. I  came across his name in a recommendation from a friend and I've been  devouring everything he wrote since then. <br />I think that the magic of his  music is the range of emotions he portrays without resorting to the common  pop/rock tricks: scale modulations, pounding drums, and screaming. His  lyrics are also thoughtful and unique. I can't recommend his music more  highly.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix has got to be,alongside T2,the decade's BEST sci-fi action  flick.Why?a)It's got action by the bucket loads,b)it's special effects are  clever and artfully done,c)it is original and d)it has BRAINS too!The  script is very intelligent(cheers go to the film's creators) and the film  itself is very artistic too(in a sci-fi kind of way).Believe me people,this  movie positively ROCKS!
6305878323|4.0|Well, most people I know have seen Mary Poppins at least once.  It's a  classic children's movie.  My 15 month old son just adores this movie and  all of the songs in it.  He can just sit there and watch it any day of the  week.  Mary Poppins was always one of my favorites as a young girl &amp;  now my son can enjoy it as well.  The DVD does have some extras to speak  of.  Although I haven't seen them yet.  Only because everytime we put it in  we just start watching the movie.  What 15 month old cares about extras?  I  would definately reccommend this to anyne who has children.  They will love  it.  I find myself singing along while my son dances.  Who says everyone  has to grow up?
B0000024RQ|5.0|This album made me cry, smile, and laugh within a span of twenty minutes.   That about sums it up.
B00004THAY|5.0|Two legends combine for a great album!    Almost every track is a winner.  HELP THE POOR and RAIN OR SHINE are stand outs.

B0000021RB|5.0|When you hear this record you find it hard to believe that it is a debut  album.  This is a result of Manager James William Guercio's advice to build  repetoire and play together for a few years before cutting the record.     This album has a good variety of styles, a prime example is the aptly  titled Introduction, the first track, which features multiple stylistic  changes and solos. This tune also displays the strong improvisational  skills that the boys possess, most notably the late Terry Kath.  Terry  Kath has some monster solos on this album.  If you are a guitar fan this  album should be in your collection.  His solos in Poem 58 and Liberation  are amazing.  He proves that he is just as inventive as Hendrix on Free  Form Guitar and that he can carry a solo seemingly forever, like on  Liberation.  This record is a contrast from many other Chicago albums  due to the absence of ballads.  Peter Cetera sings on only one track as  does Kath.  Robert Lamm provides 90% of the vocals on this album and this  is Lamm at his best.     This is the best example of Chicago's  Jazz-Rock fusion and is arguably their best album.  It spawned numerous  singles, but you'll love the tracks that weren't singles too.  Any  music fan should have this record.  Whether it's for the Jazz-Rock fusion,  Kath's mindblowing solo work, or just to see what everyone was talking  about.   10/10
B00001QEE9|3.0|First of all, before any of you fine Amazon.com readers get the wrong idea about my mediocre 3 star rating, Pinocchio is and probably will always be  the greatest animated film of all time. Calling Pinocchio a masterpiece is  an understatement. I am writing this review on the basis of how fed up I am  with the stupidity and greed that Disney has shown of late. Like so many of  the 40+ reviewers have said, why was this classic thrown together with such  little respect? The transfer to DVD does not improve upon the VHS version,  in fact it actually looks downright fuzzy at times. And boy was I ticked  off when the &quot;making of Pinocchio&quot; was not included on the DVD,  but WAS on the VHS! What am I spending the extra dollars for? Like another  reviewer said, Disney just wants the consumer to buy the next version with  the extras included.  They're no fools, they probably figure if they  include the extras on the DVD now, no one will buy it again because DVDs  don't wear out! It all comes down to the almighty dollar, right Disney?  When Disney does include extras, like on A Bug's Life, they make you buy 2  DVDs! Has anyone at Disney noticed how many hours can be stored on a single  DVD? Take Dreamworks for example, they produced a great film in the Prince  of Egypt and loaded the DVD with a ton of extras. You don't mind paying a  little extra for DVDs like the Prince of Egypt or The Iron Giant (another  superb film). Wise up Disney, you won't be able to live on reputation for  much longer if you continue trying to rip off the public. The competition  is stiff, and darn good! I bet Walt must be turning over in his grave. I  would love the folks at Disney to read this review.
079073639X|5.0|WOW, it really is one of the few movies that actually are as good as the  book!!
B000002IHD|5.0|Otis Redding had the rare ability to take a well known song and make it  sound all his own.  The best example of this appears on this essential  album.  He takes the Stones &quot;Satisfaction&quot; and transforms it from  a guitar-driven rocker to a southern fried R&amp;B number.  He replaces the  familiar guitar hook with horns and turns the Stones' complaint into a  plea.  As with many soul singers, Mr. Redding has gospel roots and he  covers three songs from the original gospel turned soul singer, Sam Cooke.  &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;, &quot;Wonderful World&quot; and  &quot;Shake&quot; show his versatilty as a singer.  The first is a gospel  driven tune, the second is pop music and the third is frenzied shouter.  &quot;Shake&quot; would become a staple of his live shows.  Mr. Redding  wan't just an interpreter of other people's songs, but a solid songwriter  is his own right.  The album contains the original version of  &quot;Respect&quot; and while it doesn't contain the defiance of Aretha's  version, it still moves. &quot;I've Been Loving You Too Long&quot; contains  one of the most heartwrenching vocals ever.  Otis Redding's life was  tradgically cut short, but he left us with this record as a reminder of his  immense talent.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul for me shows the amazing artistic effect drugs can have on you (ha ha). But seriously, this marks the Beatles move towards more complex  issues than just love and truly represents the idea of a complete album  written for itself and not as a veichle for a few singles.  The album shows  the Beatles flourishing into brilliant songwriters, masters of the studio  and more complex instrumentation such as a sitar on norweigan wood and a  fuzz bass on think for yourself.  This album is not only great in its own  right, it marks the beginning of the Beatles richest period of music with  this only really a taster of what was to come next on the Revolver and Sgt  Pepper albums.  But still, in its own right this stands as a highpoint in  the evolution of the greatest band of all time.  The lyrics are clever and  thoughtful especially on John Lennons part who was beginning to show his  own individual identity and voice within the band, establishing himself as  probably the more adventurous of the two premier songwriters, never content  on resting on his laureles with songs like &quot;Norweigan Wood&quot; which  35 years later is still a wonderous pleasure to listen to as well as  &quot;girl&quot; which considering was written the night before was both  outstanding and bitter. Paul wrote one of my favourites &quot;you won't see  me&quot; with some great vocal harmonies present as on much of the rest of  the album also.  Even though the Beatles would acheive even greater  artistic sucsess in the years following, this still remains an undeniable  classic of rock pop and folk as any band can offer, a masterpiece.
B00003CX9E|5.0|people don't watch good movies anymore. they are so brainwashed by the current crop of junk (which they have come to accept as good movies, eg waterboy, mi2, klumps, etc.) that when they DO see a good movie, they'll  shuffle it away as &quot;junk&quot;. going back to the phrase &quot;they  don't make them like they used to&quot; this is one of those happenings.  one of my friend (who worships the blockbuster era created by spielberg and  lucas and loves current films) constantly nags to me about liking black and  white movies... especially ck (citizen kane). the era this film was made in  comprised of writers and good story telling. authors that wrote really deep  and moving stories to be told visually. gone with the wind, casablanca,  etc. authors/storytellers dominated the scene whereas the hollywood of  today is dominated by corporations and company manifesto: greed. when first  released ck never did well at the box office despite critical acclaim then  it was on some dustbin somewhere collecting dirt. not only til the recent  decades that we've seen a revival, because of the given amount of junk we  have today. if you like movies that will make you change the way you live.  this is it. if you want entertainment, go elsewhere, this is not for the  light of intellects. the way that the broken childhood of charles foster  kane is displayed with such heart wrenching scenes that the symolism of the  sled (innocense)is immediately established. the bitterness of the man and  the irony of the rules that he full heartily set out to achieve yet breaks.  the naivety that came with his youth and the growing pains that came with  his lack of love and hiw unwillingness to be close. THAT is citizen kane.  it is the everyday man facing the toughest drama of his life: to love or  not to love...<br />wanna fight?...
6305657939|1.0|I know I am reviewer number 160 and no one will read my review.  Nevertheless, this movie was terrible. The love affair between Russo and  Brosnan was completely unbelievable, Russo was a horrible cast for the lead  female, seeing as how she is just tooo old for a traditionally young part,  why she is allowed to continue to hang around the police station is beyond  me, you CANNOT roll a painting up, and you CANNOT get a painting wet, and  you CANNOT paint over...this movie is just soooo stupid in so many aspects,  it is dificult to pick just one. I suppose I might as well just say that  Brosnan is made out to be the perfect male that every woman would want...if  you fell for it, you have been successfully suckered.
0060977264|4.0|This is a book written for all romantics at heart. Paulo Coelho has  written another superb novel based on the power of love, faith and hope.  This book is inspirational, and pushes us to believe and learn to recognise  the little miracles that appear to us each day. Dreams do take hard work,  patience and a lot of tears, but the author teaches us never to loose hope.  Paulo manages to move and inspire through this story. Excellent! It made me  trust in love again!
B000003TA4|5.0|This for me is one of the best albums of the 90's and one of the best of  all time.  It succesfully blends primal rage with beatlesque guitar hooks.  It's also a revolutionary album, making the alternative the mainstream to  this day with soundalike bands attempting to recreate the power and urgency  of this album.  Only problem is, Kurt Cobain really meant it!  This was raw  power, raw emotion and a truly gripping and vital listen.  It flies out of  the starting blocks with &quot;teen spirit&quot; one of the most angst  ridden anthems ever followed by the even more ferocious &quot;in  Bloom&quot; which traverses between a soft verse and a ferocious chorus,  come as you are though for me makes the album cohesive and the classic that  it is with a classically simple riff with some of cobains best lyrics, the  album continues at a ferocious pace and is an album you can both headbang  and listen to, sucsessfully starting the alternative revolution that had  been threatening before, no one however could match the apocoalyptic  heights of this album in terms of anger and true raw emotion, Kurt Cobain  was a one off, it wasn't that he invented grunge, he was grunge.  the  genuine article.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|Pathetic USA rewrite of history. British sailors died in the real  incident. Please boycott or suffer more stupid reworks.
B00003CXFU|4.0|This is definately a great, feel-good flick about Brockovich's attempts to win a court case against a PG&amp;E powerplant, in order to stop it from  continuing to polute the environment, which has been causing numerous  diseases in the local townsfolk, and to award those who have been harmed  with money. Yeah, yeah, a lot of stuff has been said about the amount of  cleavage in every shot, and I can only say that it really isn't that  distracting (and for the male viewers, it does give you some entertainment  for some of the slower portions of the movie!).  On a different note, this  does not tell you the whole story, including the part about many of the  residents never getting awarded any money. Oh well, i suppose it wouldnt  have been as good an ending.
B000002H97|5.0|Forget anything by Nirvana.  Metallica's self-titled release (also known  as the &quot;Black Album&quot;) is the BEST CD of the 90's.  It led the way  for other major rock acts, including Nirvana, and it brought heavy metal  out of the 80's and into the 90's.  Metallica plays with so much energy, so  much life, thats what makes this album amazing.  And with Metallica  exploring mew types of music on this album, it just makes it better than  &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; (Both of  which are EXCELLENT albums, but only contain one element of music, the  thrash-metal type).  &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; has to be Metallica's  best-known song, and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; is my favorite  Metallica song, whether it be a &quot;ballad&quot; or not.  Songs like  &quot;Sad But True&quot;, &quot;Of Wolf And Man&quot;, and &quot;Wherever I  May Roam&quot; also make this album a complete winner from start to finish.   The only song I don't care for is &quot;Don't Tread On Me&quot;.   Like I  said, this is Metallica's best album, and everybody (critics, fans, ets.)  know it too.
B00000J7JO|4.0|After years in confusion and problems, the chillis have got their act together ans produced a very, very good album which is well paced and  impeccably produced.  Around the World shows the chillis are back to their  old selves with a super funky bass groove and the brilliant jonh Fruiscante  back into the fold showing why he is the best chillis guitarist.  However,  what makes this seem more than just a re-run of thier classic (and best)  1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik is that Kleidis is now actually singing  rather than chanting showing that he has matured as a vocalist and as a  lyricist.  The songs are in general less hardcore and funky than before  with a more varying canvas evident from the songs with the 80's feel of  &quot;paralell universe&quot; and the standout song for me &quot;scar  tissue&quot; showing a mature, musically proficient and cohesive outfit.   The title track has a simple and melodic feel unlike any other Chillis song  and the standard throughout the album is a very high one.  I would not rate  this above Blood Sugar Sex Magik for the prime reason that, Blood Sugar is  that much more funky, nervy and raunchy, however the sheer diversity of  this album means that it is not far behind by any means, and depending on  your taste in music, you might even prefer this one.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Thank goodness this girl is cute because that is all I can say for her. This CD is full of tired rhythm tracks, sloppy ballads(Dear Diary), and bad  singing. The title song is listenable but only once. I did'nt know where  she was coming from with the RollingStones remake(Satisfaction). It seems  so out of place and awkwardly done. I received the CD as a gift and believe  me,they should'nt have.
B000001EKX|3.0|Despite a gold album,KISS wasn't satisfied with the final outcome of their  debut album.The band felt they weren't reaching the public.Determined to do  so,they went back into the studio to record their second album.Released  several months after their debut,Hotter Than Hell was their weakest selling  album.It climbed to #100 and stalled there for a while before dropping from  sight. Disappointed but undaunted,the band went through rigorous extensive  touring opening for Rory Gallagher,Savoy Brown,Manfred Mann and Blue Oyster  Cult(little did B.O.C.realize that they'd be opening for KISS when KISS  started headling their own tours).<br />Too bad,their sophomore effort was  another helping of good songs. It also marked some progression  artistically.This time,Ace Frehley contributes two songs(Parasite and  Strange Ways).He also co-writes one with Paul(Comin'Home).This shows that  Aces strangely underrated talent as a songwriter was developing. Gene  contributes two more songs(All The Way and Watchin'You)Gene also co-writes  two more(Goin'Blind with Steve Coronel and Let Me Go Rock and Roll with  Paul).Paul contributes three more(Got To Choose,title song and Mainline).It  was also their first all original album.<br />Peter does lead on two  songs(Mainline and Strange Ways),showing that his vocal talents were being  put to maximum use.Simmons and Stanley do lead on the rest of the album.The  band rocks hard.They also give us some more rock and roll party  tunes.<br />While it sounds like its predecessor,it's also softer at the same  time.The songs are also well written and unforgettable.<br />Overall,this is a  good album that is a must have.No fans music library should be without it.
B00003CXGG|1.0|On a whim, I saw this in the theatre, expecting a Jackie Chan sort of  movie. Essentially, the fight scenes aren't worth sitting through the joke  of a script. This film is an utter waste of time.
B000005H4K|5.0|Yes, this is as good as everyone says!  These masters complimenting each  other with tremendous balance and empathy. This is a wonderful opportunity  to hear Ellington's versatility: some dissonance and minimization, and a  whole lot of Ellington swing.  Mingus, as usual, is a powerhouse  throughout, with his great bowing bass and creative lines and pairing  generating energy and interest.  The (few) bass solos are entirely  engaging.  As noted elsewhere, Mingus seems almost to challenge Ellington  on some numbers, threatening to take over with his inspired bass. But  Ellington more than meets the challenge with his own aggressive stylings.<br />Max Roach is probably my favorite drummer and he just shines here (as he  does on his collaborations with Clifford Brown).  A dazzling display of  popping sounds, syncopation, splashy cymbals, and on-the-money drum rolls;  he creates a symphony of percussion.  \\"Solitude\\" merits (as too few  alternate versions do) the inclusion of alternative takes, as the second  take is slower and more in the Ellington style.  A beautiful collection,  very well recorded, with brief liner notes and a nice cover photo of these  three giants in the studio. Highly recommended!
B000002UA9|5.0|Please Please launched 4 Beatles classics which includes I saw her  standing there, Love Me Do, Title track and of course the energenic Twist  and Shout, but also includes the often overlooked gems &quot;misery and  &quot;There's a place&quot;. The covers are pretty good(well most of them)  and the rest of the songs are pretty good exept A Taste of Honey which  isn't . Overall a very good debut just not as good as there glory days  65-69.
B00000099Y|5.0|words cannot describe how tool has had an affect on my life. their music  is so brilliant. danny carey is such a talented drummer(and extremely  underrated), adam jones is an excellent guitarist, justin chancellor is an  awesome bassist, and maynard james keenan... i can't even begin to list how  great he is. he has the most unique voice of any vocalist i've ever heard.  whether he's screaming or whispering, he always sends a chill down my  spine. aenima has got to be one of the best albums of the 90's(along with  tool's other releases, undertow and opiate). every song is powerful and  hits you in the face, so to speak. i'm glad to hear new material from  maynard(a perfect circle has a great album), but i'm looking forward to  hearing new tool stuff soon. if you like good metal(not junk like limp  bizkit and papa roach), check out tool. by the way, maynard has a guest  appearance on the new deftones album... it's a beautiful song, of course.

B00004BZ0N|3.0|This album is O.K. - although I don't think it's a classic, I don't think  it's resale bin material either.  On the contrary, regardless of what the  self-serving writers at Rolling Stone think, this wasn't the best album of  the 70s (&quot;Rumours&quot; was) or the 80s (&quot;Joshua Tree&quot; was).   Additionally, it isn't even the best of 1979.<br />As for the music,  &quot;Train in Vain&quot; is great, but there are too many  &quot;skip-over&quot; tracks to rate this better than 3-stars.
6305750750|2.0|This is going to be short and sweet.  The only good character was Darth Maul (Ray Park), he definitely had the best onscreen prescence and menace.   KILL JAR-JAR!   Liam Neeson's performance was flat, and Jake Lloyd was  just plain unbelievable.  Ewan McGregor was little better, all the acting  was very boring, and there was no emotion!  What attracted people to the  original trilogy wasn't so much the special effects, but the great original  acting and emotion that the actors poured out.  I felt Episode I was  basically a 2-hour commercial for Star Wars toys and to line Lucas'  pockets, rather than remain true to the Star Wars ideal.  Sorely  dissappointed...
B00004R997|1.0|Just to (maybe) give the last reviewers some hint about Disney's motive: I  think they don't want to be sued alongside with Marlboro &amp; al. 45 years  from now when the present viewers will look for some entertainment (and  some more money for their lawyers) during their old days, by making  somebody else responsible for their choices. By the way, G. Orwell (1984)  thought only the communists were prone to alter history so it suits what  they wanted you to know/believe.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought this cd for the Roswell theme and was pleased that it also has  the music from eminems &quot;stan&quot;.The whole cd is amazing.I also had  the pleasure of seeing her in concert at the Showbox in Seattle last  week.Incredible show!!!I'm just in awe of this  woman.Talented,beautiful,inteligent,funny and that voice!Breathy and  powerful at the same time.How does she manage that?A must have cd for  anyone who likes music.If you get a chance to see her in concert don't miss  it.
B00004THAY|1.0|Better than Sominex.  This gets old fast.  I don't understand all the  acclaim that either of these artists have garnered over the years.  Eddie  Van Halen, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Page and dozens of others are better  guitarists.
B000021XR5|5.0|Let me get this out right now.....before this album, I was a casual STP fan.  I have &quot;Core&quot;, and I always felt it had a good, hard,  driving sound to it.  So, I took a chance on &quot;No. 4&quot; .... and am  I ever happy I did!<br />Like another reviewer points out, it takes a few  listens before you truly fall in love with this one.  For me, on about the  3rd listen I was totally hooked.  Now, I can't stop playing it (in my car,  on my PC at work using RealJukebox, etc).<br />I truly like every song on this  album.  My first love was &quot;Sour Girl&quot;, and I still favor it.   However, I have come to love &quot;Glide&quot; and &quot;Atlanta&quot; (you  can tell I actually favor the softer STP songs, since they absolutely know  how to rock and those types of songs are more of a musical stretch for  them).  &quot;Sex &amp; Violence&quot; is an awesome,  tap-the-steering-wheel kind of song (remember &quot;Sex Type  Thing&quot;?).<br />Bottom line:  if you like &quot;Core&quot; at all, then  give this one a shot.  I have to believe you won't be disappointed.
B00004T9UF|4.0|This cd is a must have! It has great beats and good lyrics. Everyone is so  eager to diss this rapper when all they do is read about him. You cannot  take everything he says as for real, he is a comic rapper that has two  great cd's.
B00004THAY|5.0|Being a fan of both B.B. King &amp; Eric Clapton, I had always hoped they  would do an album together.  B.B. King is known for his classic blues  style, and Clapton known for a more contemporary style.  They blend  magically; Truly a great collaboration.
0780624890|1.0|I submitted a review of this before - but it must have gotten  lost.<br />'Blade' is about as gothic as Kermit The Frog. It's more of a blend  of 'I'm gonna get you sucka' and 'Demolition Man' with a little bit of the  failed TV mini-series 'Kindred:The Embraced' thrown in. [Director] Stephen  Norrington obviously got too caught with MTV videos as the film is so  stylized it becomes funny. <br />Because his mother was bitten by a vampire  shortly before his birth, Blade (an uninspired Wesley Snipes who becomes  his own action figure) has all of the powers of a vampire, but lacks their  weaknesses. He is even able to live without drinking blood, through the  routine use of a garlic-based serum. He has based his existence on the  destruction of other vampires because they caused the death of his mother.  Brandishing both blades and bullets, he is as fearless as he is determined  in battling the undead. Now me must stop a vampire punk (a slumming Stephen  Dorff) from resurrecting the blood god of old, with the future of humanity  hanging in the balance (Gee, with all the humans 'coverted', what would the  Vampyres eat?)<br />With its cartoon martial arts, 'Blade' should appeal to  those who like their movies slick, flashy and devoid of substance. An  insult to the Vampyre myth, I would avoid this thing.
B00004TH83|3.0|I have been familiar with Lara Fabian for most of my life. Lara has much  talent, but her English album is disapointing. I would reccomend this to  most people on the street just to get acquinted with her, but her French  language albums are supier in quality and context to this one, maybe one  day they will release an all French CD.
B000002U8G|5.0|The cover of \\"Meddle\\" is tinged with blue, comes off as blobbish and looks like murk from the sea. The six tracks listed on the back of the CD appear downright anemic, looking like EP material instead of a full-fledged album release by an up-and-coming band in 1971. But don't let appearances fool you -- \\"Meddle\\" is quietly one of the best Pink Floyd albums ever released.<br /><br />It begins with the modern-sounding instrumental \\"One of These Days.\\" Drummer Nick Mason provides his sole lead vocal performance for the band (one measly line) at the start of the gusty song, and things get off and running at a surging pace. \\"One of These Days\\" was a unique choice to lead off such a mellow and atmospheric record, and it remained a concert staple in the Floyd cannon for years, even into the 1990s. \\"Meddle\\" truly begins at \\"A Pillow of Winds,\\" which comes off as a beautiful reverie, a simple song with gentle guitars, both acoustic and slide, plus easy lyrics not far from Syd Barrett-penned ideas several years earlier (see [[ASIN:B000002U9Y A Saucerful of Secrets]]). \\"Fearless\\" is just as laid back, yet possesses a sense of fight, typical of a Roger Waters-written tune. Also of note is the cool upscale chord pattern within the song that is addictive, courtesy of new full-time guitarist and huge influencer, [[ASIN:B000ELJBAK David Gilmour]]. Gilmour shines on \\"Meddle,\\" finally settling in with Floyd on a full-length LP and getting a chance to flaunt his licks. He was a welcome addition and a huge part of the band for many years to come.<br /><br />\\"Meddle\\" is also noteworthy for its soft, lush singing by various Floyd members, which adds to the dreamy effects. \\"San Tropez,\\" sung and written by a younger and seemingly less angst-filled Waters, has a loungey vibe to it, half exotic, half cheesball, but actually an unexpected curve from this usually spaced out, psychadelic foursome. Richard Wright shines nicely as the five-star restaurant piano player on this tune, while his buddy Waters is the A-list singer for the night.<br /><br />The four members collaborated on the short blues number about their howling dog, \\"Seamus,\\" and worked together again on the much better song that follows, the mighty \\"Echoes,\\" one of Floyd's all-time best tunes.  It begins with a soft submarine ping that sets the tone for a faraway, dreamy, underwater feel. When the words, sung by Richard Wright, kick in, it's hard not to be mesmerized, so hypnotic is the vibe and sound. \\"Echoes\\" contains several bridges, starts and stops, with the music sometimes progressing at a snail's pace. However, it's originally orchestrated and planned, with nothing left to chance, no matter how disjointed the song may seem at times. The dreaminess formulates into a rythmic drum beat, which soon turns eerie as several familiarly Floydish screams weave into the music like poisonous snakes. If you give \\"Echoes\\" time to sink in, it will reveal just about every reflective mood you can conjure. Toward the end, Gilmour pops in with an anthemic guitar melody, and soon Wright is crooning his last stanzas, getting the song back to its original melody. If you're up for some musical experimentation, \\"Echoes\\" is a mood piece that transcends the senses a bit and offers up something different.<br /><br />I've always had a soft spot for this underrated Pink Floyd classic, and in some ways it equals the band's succeeding albums that sold better (see [[ASIN:B000002U82 Dark Side Of The Moon]]). The only way to understand \\"Meddle\\" is to give it a try; it's worth your time if you dig Pink Floyd.he A-list singer for the night.

6305609691|5.0|I submitted a review of this before - But it must have gotten lost<br />Based on the Joseph Conrad novel 'The Heart Of Darkness', Apocalypse Now ranks as  one of the greatest movies of all time, totally stamped on our pop-culture.  Forged by the awesome vision of both John Milius and [director] Francis  Coppola, the film is set during the Vietnam War where Captain Willard  (Martin Sheen) is ordered by the Army to take a navy patrol boat into  Cambodia and kill the renegade Colonel Kurtz. The journey of Captain  Willard not only becomes a lesson about the horror of war, but also about  the very nature of humanity. While most films are lucky if they contain one  or two great sequences, Apocalypse Now is nothing but a series of great  sequences tied together by the river, the river that takes Captain Willard  straight to Colonel Kurtz and the films misunderstood ending. Confusing to  some, the end is perfect as fails to answer any questions about 'right' and  'wrong' - Questions easily lost during the Vietnam War.<br />Apocalypse Now is  better that Platoon, Full Metal Jacket or even the overrated 'Saving  Private Ryan' because it simply goes beyond those films. It goes beyond war  straight into the soul where it discovers things about humanity many don't  want to know. It is, in short, a tale of Human Nature.
6304595247|5.0|I don't want to repeat what has been said about this moving video. I just  want to draw people's attention to the AUDIO element of this feature film.  Ryuichi Sakamoto's music is absolutely spot on. The BITTERsweet (more  bitter than sweet) melody, the heart-tearing violin lines, and the  hopelessly despairing mood it conjures, all work painfully well with the  story. For those who are not so familiar with Sakamoto's music, he's the  composer of film music for Bertolucci's Last Emperor and The Little Buddha  (whereby he rearranged the famous Barber Adagio with a subtle yet perfectly  appropriate change of mood). I'd strongly recommed those who love this  video to indulge themselves in the AUDIO counterpart of it by getting the  newly released Sakamoto CD &quot;Cinemage&quot; released by Sony.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is an all time classic and my pick as the bestfilm of '99.  Impeccably designed by Rick Heinrichs, and with striking costumes by Colleen Atwood, this visually arresting film is lit by Emmanuel Lubezki in a stylised, desaturated colour scheme which borders on monochrome and fuels the spookiness of its milieu.  This rich imagery exists on a thin line between the dreamy and the nightmarish, and can be tilted in either direction with a mere flick of Burton's unerring sense of the macabre.<br /> In Burton's film, Ichabod Crane is a New York City constable in 1799, a forensics freak with a penchant for pragmatism and a burning need to get the city to employ more scientific means of solving crimes. To test the efficiency of his devices - large, ornate metallic &quot;tools&quot; - his boss transfers him to Sleepy Hollow, N.Y, where there have been a couple of mysterious beheadings. Irving imagined Crane as lanky and naive; Johnny Depp plays him as an inquisitive priss, at once sexy and fumbling and fey, like Donald O'Connor doing his best slapstick Cary Grant. <br /> His arrival upstate is greeted with evil eyes of the literal and figurative variety. In addition to the Headless Horseman riding around, there's talk of witchcraft, for it seems someone is conspiring with the Horseman to murder suspicious locals. No one is spared, not even the kid whose severed head we never see but can imagine airbrushed on a jar of Gerber strained peas. Ichabod is assisted in his detective work by Young Masbeth (amazing Marc Pickering), who plays quiet Watson to Ichabod's pompous Holmes. <br />With a wonderful preformance by Christina Ricci, Sleepy Hollow is Tim Burtons finest hour and a must for anyones DVD collection.  END

B00004TJTS|2.0|I was prepared to like this movie more than I did.  I love animals and,  well, with &quot;Skip&quot; in the title, I expected a lot of cute animal  stuff.  Well, it was there, but it wasn't nearly enough.  Roger Ebert raved  about this movie; it's obvious now that his love for his childhood pet  grossly clouded his usual Pulitzer prize-winning judgment.  This movie is a  compendium of tired cliches.  The voice-over narration is truly laughable.   I suppose the &quot;messages&quot; are &quot;meaningful&quot; if you've  never seen any other movies.  But if you have, you'll cringe at the  ham-handed efforts of this movie to be &quot;deep.&quot;  This is a movie  with a well-intended heart, a heck of a dog as the lead pet, but short of  execution.  Don't buy this DVD - rent it (at most).

158234082X|5.0|As a chef-wannabe, I found this book full of insight and intrigue.  I loved the conversational style and behind-the-scenes that Chef Bourdain  provided.  I felt like I was a fly on the wall of the kitchens he described  (be that good or bad). The kitchen scenes were fast-paced and really let  you get a sense of what it is like on a busy night in the kitchen putting  out hundereds of meals.  At times my heart was racing!  It has just the  right sprinkling of gossip and scandal to keep you turning the pages.  This  book is a must read for anyone who enjoys dining out, Food TV (as long as  you're not an Emeril fan) and other chef wannabes.
B00000JCB2|3.0|I think it is crazy how fast everybody jumped onto the Limp Bizkit band  wagon. I guess we all got hooked on &quot;Faith&quot;, then  &quot;Nookie&quot;kept us all listening. I like this Cd, but it is  incomplete. It needs another good song to add to &quot;Nookie&quot; and  &quot;Break Stuff&quot;. &quot;Rearranged&quot; was ok, but I don't see how  it was always on the top of TRL and &quot;Break Stuff&quot; never made it  big. If you buy this Cd, buy it for the rock side, the true Limp Bizkit.
B00004W5UA|5.0|Stop everything you are doing and go see Fight Club, then see it again with pen and paper.  I cannot even  begin to describe the profundity and  visceral power  of the movie; sorry, &quot;movie&quot; is not an adequate   term to describe this life changing, paradigm shifting, introspective  journey.  Semantics aside, Fight Club  was 2.5 hours of intense adrenaline  pumping mayhem that oscillated between intensely poignant and brutally  disturbing.  This &quot;movie&quot; is an unapologetic critique on the  empty consumer/consumption/recycle idealogy that has defined our existence  on this planet.  It is not until you see this movie from the perspective of  our pathologically insane protagonist do you really see your life and  question YOUR sanity.  <br />Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give a tour de  force performance; quite possibly the best in their lives.  They symbolize  the polar extremes of abandon-restraint, freedom-bondage and  fantasy-reality; yet their distinctions are not entirely black and white,  but instead meld into a weird Yin-Yang.  You cannot help but to empathize  with both characters because they reflect our conscious and subconscious  desires.  Their underground, anarchic lifestyle, existing at the edges of  society affords them the ultimate freedom to live with impunity.  The  direction is sleek, the cinematography is graphic and the sex scenes are  downright salacious.  The fight scenes are graphic and brutal, but  necessary.  These are men emasculated by their meager pedestrian lives,  regaining their sense of power through the spilling of blood and endurance  of pain.  <br />Go see this movie, it will change your life.
B000009ED0|4.0|Kid Rock is amazing. &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; is a great song. It is true  Rock. Also, my favorite song, &quot;Bullgod&quot; is sweet. It is another  plain and old rock song. &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot; has a different,  easier beat, but it is a good song. Now for the only song on the Cd that I  don't like: &quot;Cowboys&quot;. Something about that song just says: Not  rock, not rap, something odd. The whole Cd is generally good, though, and  it is a great buy.
B0000013G9|4.0|The only reason why I reated this 4 startes rather then 5 is because Fanmail is a little better. If you're a TLC fan, I would highly reccomend  it. But as for CrazySexyCool...<br />Creep--you all heard this so you  decide<br />Kick Your Game--my favorite track. It's so cool the way the base  is in the beginning.<br />Diggin' On You--a sweet song. Personally, not reall  a favorite but I still like to listen to it.<br />Case Of The Fake  People--awsome! It really explains what the girls are thinkin at the  time.<br />Red Light Special--kinda discucting. I usually skip this  one.<br />Waterfalls--you all heard this so you decide<br />Let's Do It  Again--kinda sick. I usually skip this one.<br />If I Was Your  Girlfriend--phat beat. Faster-tempo then others...a nice one to listen  to.<br />Take Our Time--sweet. I like it anyway.<br />Switch--the chorus bugs me  after a while but the first few times you listen to it, you'll love  it.<br />Sumthin' Wicked This Way Comes--creepy. It's the truth but  creepy.<br />For all of you who enjoy waterfalls and creep, then you HAVE to  get this album. But, if you're not all to crazy about it, try Fanmail.
B000001Y42|4.0|Almost everybody has heard &quot;Faith&quot; and just started going crazy.  It is that kind of song. In my eyes, it might be the best song of the  ninties, but it isn't a song that you just sit down and listen to over and  over. That is why you can't be fooled and think that &quot;Faith&quot; is  the only good song on this Cd. The whole Cd is great. You can listen to  every single song over and over and never get bored. This Cd is great. I  love it and I know all of you do too.

If you are going to start off with AIC album  I think that  you should get DIRT!  I think that DIRT is a greater album then this.  But  do not get ME WORNG is is a good album too.  The song MAN IN THE BOX is  play alot on the radio and can be heard in the movie THE PERFECT STORM. Out  of all the AIC albums I think that this one has the most radio play,  but   that just all depends on were yo live.   ENJOY!!! ROCK ON FOREVER!

At first when this came out  I did not camp out at the stores looking for the first copy.  I was a fan  of Nirvana's pre-work but looking at the mixed reviews and every one said  it was hard and evil. and the lyrics were sick is twisted and the Nirvana  just got lucky with Nevermind.  Every one said that Cobain had just totaly  lost it and would probly kill him self in the year to come ( OK so that  were right about one thing but once I got this album I enjoyed it alot)   After hearing some songs on the radio I got it and enjoyed it form the  first time I put it in to the last time.  I enjoy this more then Nevermind.   I enjoy Nevermind alot and I think that Nevemind is a more fun album but I  have many probles with it.  All for all this is a greater album.   It has  one of the greatest ending of all time! One last little thing this album  dose not have [EXPLICT LYRICS]!  No were dose is say [EXPLICT LYRICS]! I  think that they say that becuz they have a so call [EDITED] one so that  Wal-Mart can have this in stock but nothing is cut out of the album.  The  only thing that the is deferent is that the back of the cover has flowers  and the so called [EXPLICT LYRICS] one has well flowers and other stuff.  Enjoy this album!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney sure has matured! In her 2nd CD, she dooesn't have that baby voice like she did on her 1st CD. After hearing 'Lucky' for the first time on the  radio, I knew I had to get the CD so on the same day, I went and bought it.  There are other GREAT songs on it too like 'Stronger' and 'What U See (Is  What U Get'. But my fave song is 'Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know'. This  CD is way better than her '...Baby One More Time' CD. Way better.
B0000214F2|4.0|I wouldn't really say that it would be a tragedy if you didn't see it, but  try if possible. It was crass, funny, heartwarming, and obnoxious.

B000003BF1|5.0|This albums is just amazing. Absolutely classic. When I listen to this  album, I remember why I love Rock n Roll. Released in 1969 at a point when  the Stones were in the middle of a stretch where they constantly one-uped  themselves. Let It Bleed was the 2nd of 4 albums which are completely and  undoubtedly masterpieces. Midnight Rambler is the best song on the album  and ranks as 2nd best in the entire Stones catalog, only Sympathy For The  Devil is better. The lyrics, menacing beat, Jagger's wonderful harp  playing, and Richard's backward guitar beats at the end make this classic  great. Next best song is Gimme Shelter. No song better gives the feel of  what Vietnam was like than this tune. You Can't Always Get What You Want is  an epic and brillantly written, perfect way to close the album. Live With  Me rocks. The title track is just really, really cool. Monkey Man is the  most underrated song the Stones have ever put out. I mean, what could be  better than Mick Jagger singing &quot;I'm a monkey&quot;? You Got The  Silver is Keith Richard's first lead vocal and it's a good one. Love In  Vain is ok. The only reason I don't rate this as their best work is Country  Honk. If they had used the rock verison, Honky Tonk Women, I don't think I  would be able to say this wasn't the best album ever made, but as it stand  now, Exile is the best, this and Sticky Fingers are in the top ten and  Beggars Banquet is in the top 20.
6304613199|2.0|It's been a while since I've seen a movie this bad. Lost in Space from  1998 was about as terrible as this. This movie was absolutely repulsive.  The plot made very little sense compared to the book and the people did  totally incompetent things in this movie that a normal person put in these  situations wouldn't do. Don't even rent this at the video store
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem is pretty much the only rapper I really like other than metal rap. But I like this album. Not only is it a fallow up, but its a sequel. In  this album, there is a second PSA, a second Paul skit, a second Ken Kaniff  skit, The Real Slim Shady (Like My Name is), references to the first album,  and Kim which is him fighting with his wife and killing her which is a  prequel to &quot;97 Bonnie and Clyde&quot; on the first album. He also  makes a refference dissing  that pop trash like Britany Spears, *NSYNC, and  I don't blame him for Christina Agulara. In &quot;Marshal Mathers&quot; he  spoofs the LFO song &quot;Summer Girls&quot; and talks about his 2 arch  enimies ICP, and I don't blame him for that either. So in closing, this  album has some of the best songs ( &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;  &quot;Kill You&quot; &quot;Marshal Mathers&quot; &quot;Stan&quot;) and  skits (&quot;Steve Berman&quot; &quot;Paul&quot; &quot;Ken Kaniff&quot;).
B000001FA4|5.0|This was the first U2 cd I bought (allthough I've listened to death Joshua  Tree, which is a tape) I love this Cd. One of my favorate tracks is Wire,  which is wonderfull.  Heck the whole cd is wonderfull.  In fact if you like  U2 this is one of the Cd's you should buy.  If you like 80's music this and  the Joshua Tree are some of the best ever made in the 80's.  (Boy is sposed  to be good too.)
6305075492|5.0|****************************   REVIEW REVISED NOV-18-2014  ****************************    I'm lumping several editions of this film in a single review so it would appear on all Amazon product pages of this film.  The editions I'm reviewing are:    2014 Kino Region-A Blu-ray (ASIN: B00N5ND6PU) and Region-1 DVD (ASIN: B00N5ND88U)  2014 Eureka Region-B Blu-ray/DVD combo (Amazon UK ASIN: B00KT67Q0W)  2002 Kino all-region NTSC DVD (ASIN: B00006JMQG)  1997 Image all-region NTSC DVD (ASIN: 6305075492)    \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" is a visually stunning German silent film that tells the story of a mad doctor who trains a sleepwalker to commit evil deeds.  It was a groundbreaking film in many ways, such as its use of an unreliable narrator as a framing device, and its expressionistic images resembling one's nightmare (or the mind state of a mentally-ill person) -- distorted views, deformed spaces, bizarre lights and shadows.  This film, in 1920, ushered in a new era of German Expressionism on film, a period that produced such classics as The Last Laugh, Nosferatu, Metropolis, and others.    There have been many public domain copies of \\"Caligari\\" sold in stores and online, or available free to view online.  Many of them use plain, static intertitles and have running times as short as 51 minutes.  The only versions worth seeing are the four I'm reviewing here due to their completeness of footage used (with running time over 70 minutes), the use of stylized intertitles, and, of course, improved picture quality.    Currently, the best edition for North America is the 2014 Region-A Blu-ray from Kino (ASIN: B00N5ND6PU).  A corresponding Region-B Blu-ray is also available from Eureka for European customers (Amazon UK ASIN: B00KT67Q0W).  These two editions are the result of a restoration, conducted by Germany's F.W. Murnau Foundation, that used the original camera negative for the first time.  Hence, the picture quality is exceedingly good here.  Even though the film's first act is missing from the camera negative (thus inferior footage had to be used in its place), the result as shown on the Blu-ray is still pretty good-looking, as attested by the screen captures at DVDBeaver.  The running time for both discs is 75 minutes, excluding restoration credits at the beginning and end.  This is the longest running time of all the editions reviewed here, possibly due to a slightly slower frame rate.  I noticed more footage as well: early in the film, for instance, the title card \\"The annual fair\\" is preceded by a shot of the protagonist not found in earlier DVD editions.  The stylized intertitles are in German only (supported by English subtitles), since they are from the camera negative's original flash titles.  As bonus features, both the Kino and Eureka discs contain an excellent 53-minute documentary on the history and significance of \\"Caligari\\".  The Eureka disc also includes a comprehensive full-length audio commentary by David Kalat, as well as a Region-2 DVD copy with the same content.  Kino's edition also comes in DVD, but it is sold separately (ASIN: B00N5ND88U).  Both the Kino and Eureka editions offer two music accompaniments: an original score composed and performed by Freiburg Conservatory of Music in Germany, and a more modern-sounding score by American hip hop musician Paul D. Miller.    The 2002 Kino DVD edition (ASIN: B00006JMQG) was based on a restoration by Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv.  It runs 73 minutes, excluding restoration credits.  Stylized intertitles were recreated in English, but the DVD picture quality is not as good, with more noticeable print damages, especially near the beginning.  Two synthesizer music scores are included, by Donald Sosin and by Rainer Viertblöck.  One noteworthy extra on this disc is a 44-minute version of the 1920 silent film \\"Genuine: the Tale of a Vampire\\", an expressionistic fantasy film that was director Robert Wiene's less successful followup to \\"Caligari\\".  The full-length, 88-minute version of this film is not available on home video.    In 1997, restorer David Shepard produced the first worthwhile DVD edition, released by Image Entertainment (ASIN: 6305075492).  It runs 71 minutes, excluding restoration credits.  Like the Kino 2002 disc, it uses stylized, recreated English intertitles.  But unlike the other three editions mentioned above, there are no title cards indicating the film's different acts.  Although the print quality seems to be quite good, the DVD is a \\"port\\" from the Image laserdisc edition, thus resulting in all kinds of video artifacts inherited from that outdated video format.  Also, due to an error made when the print was struck, there is a horizontal line near the top of the picture for much of the film's duration.  The DVD's picture is also window-boxed, which has now become a useless mode of presentation for modern TV sets.  Even with a nice chamber orchestra score by Timothy Brock and Mike Budd's insightful full-length audio commentary, this DVD is the least desirable edition among the four reviewed here due to the shortcomings mentioned above.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Although not the most original science fiction film, Pitch Black is a blast to watch. From the at times disorienting tinting of the early scenes  to the excellent use of sound effects, Pitch Black is a worthy addition to  any science fiction lover's collection. The creatures themselves are fast,  viscious and scary. While there could be more character development, there  is enough so that we actually care about the criminal's apparent  redemption. This one is worth watching again and again. It's destined to be  one of the most under-appreciated films of the year.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Yeah ! I may be like 70 in the year 2050 but in that futuristic era I can predict that Star Wars will be there because is part of the american  culture Star Wars will exist forever in the hearts and minds off all  americans. ok let's get to the review before I get sentimental This trilogy  box set is a re-issue of the special edition trilogy it has the same movies  with no new enhancement   but..... the only thing that is going to made me  buy it is the 10 minute EP2 documentary
B000002LEM|5.0|OU812 is probably one of Van Halen's most enjoyable(after 1984 and For  Unlawful Carnal Knowledge). When It's Love, Cabo Wabo, Source of Infection  and Finish What Ya Started are the best songs on here. Eddie's crazy guitar  sounds of Source of Infection and Sammy's loud vocals on Cabo Wabo are  worth buying the CD for. Van Halen was and still is the greatest rock band  on earth.
B00000JCB2|1.0|This cd is a prime example of whats wrong with our country. A fool such as  Fred Durst is a teenager's idol, and the music is insipid and stupid. This  is not metal either (despite what all these fools and posers think). Metal  is In Flames, Children of Bodom, Testament, Opeth, King Diamond, Megadeth,  Arch Enemy and countless others. Melody and aggression mixed. This is  nothing but childs trash from a bunch of talentless clowns. And thats not  in reference to slipknot, though they share a similar problem.
0316921173|2.0|On business trips I pack this block of pulp in lieu of iron dumbells.  Great for preacher curls. Its contents though are lightweight. I, of  course, speak in the realm of the postmodern spectrum. An introduction to  the dreamscapes of plot-phobic, allusion-rich, tangent-frenzied  postmodernists would surely use DFW as a takeoff point, if only to break  literature's laymen into the more finely wrought and intellectual pointed  works of Thomas Pynchon, Don Delillo or even the significantly less  talented William Vollman. By comparison, a pugilist should spar with Willie  Pep(DFW) before stepping into the ring with Sugar Ray Robinson(Delillo) or  Muhammed Ali(Pynchon). That I would use such an adversarial metaphor is  part of the problem with IJ. You never quite endear yourself to the  supplicants of this tome. The difficulty of course lies in the fact that it  is troublesome trying to befriend cardboard cutouts. The characters hardly  ring true as real people or even the shallow people from  &quot;reality&quot; based shows such as &quot;The Real World&quot;. They  are more often than not no better than the punchline to some tedious joke.  Sure, this is an experimental piece of work that may or may not rely upon  conventional constructs of characters, but even in its unconventional  manner, no depth is achieved. Slothtrop, Pirate, Mexico, et al of Pynchon's  &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; invade my dreams without warrant whereas I  can hardly recall the names of Wallace's creations. <br />When comparing IJ  with Michael Crichton sci-fi thrillers or romance novels graced with images  of Fabio(as some other reviewers have done) it is easy to grant IJ a full  five stars. <br />However, to be fair and to be just, IJ must be measured  against other postmodern epics to which it hopes to become colleagues with;  &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Underworld&quot;, etc. In that sense,  it becomes nothing more than a little brother. Immature, bratty,  self-centered and self-important.
6304383177|5.0|This is my favorite comedy of all time. I've seen it more than 30 times. I once watched it three times in one day. The entire cast lead by the wonderful Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant deliver immaculate performances. This film is regarded as the greatest screwball comedy of all time and even made AFI's prestigious list of the 100 greatest movies of all time. I highly recommend this movie. If I could only watch one more movie this would be my undisputed choice. This classic will never get dated because of its high quality.
0671867369|3.0|While Band of Brothers is well-written, I made the mistake of reading it  immediately after finishing Ambrose's book Citizen Soldiers.  While the  latter was excellent and cannot be praised highly enough, I had a sense of  deja vu while reading Band of Brothers.  Quite of few of the stories were  duplicated.  Unfortunately, Band of Brothers comes across as a  sequel.<br />That said, Band of Brothers is an enjoyable book and Ambrose is a  good writer.  However, I believe that Citizen Soldiers is a significantly  better book.<br />My only real complaint about the book is the constant  praising of one of the soldiers (Winters).  While the soldiers were  uniformly brave and extremely competent, the praise does go a bit over the  top.  Continuous repetition tends to be counter-productive.
B000046PVN|5.0|In spite of this being one of John Willaim's earlier scores, it still  remains his best. The score is faithful to John William's usual style, id  est with the odd echo of Star Wars : New Hope but definately does not copy  any of his other soundtracks. What makes this particular title well worth  listening to is his ability to convey emotion in his music, with each  character having his/her own theme and intruments. It is like listening to  a musical play wherein you can actually picture the action.  &quot;Superman&quot; simply wouldn't be the same if it were not accompanied  by this stirring score.
B000007NZ5|4.0|...Not as high as in 'Tyr' or 'Eternal Idol', but still high enough to get one's attention. Compared to Tyr particularly, this CD trails behind in  themes and ideas. It still is, a very good album, though, and by 'very  good' I don't only mean sonically. The main value of 'Headless Cross' lies  elsewhere.. Even though this is a rather conservative release for 1989 and  from the pioneers of progressive hard rock, it does manage to convey a  dark-hued, metaphysical feeling. There are some really great songs here,  alongside some not so great ones. The introduction is cute and the title  track 'Headless Cross' that follows is both powerful and memorable. 'Call  of the Wild' and 'Black Moon' are standard hard rock tunes, nothing  special... 'Devil and Daughter' a bit better and more pleasant, and 'Kill  in the Spirit World' is interesting and original. But the two tracks that  make the difference here are the touching 'When Death Calls', and the eerie  'Nightwing', by far the best song of the album. All in all, this is a  rather personal, introspective album, the kind of album that you have to be  in the mood to relate to. There is power here, though, and there is an  intensely evocative, almost overwhelming feeling behind the wall of sound  of 'Headless Cross'... I wouldn't say that this is Sabbath's best album,  but it is definitely a winner.
B00000J7JO|1.0|What a disappointment after One Hot Minute. Sounds like a feeble attempt  at a late 90s BSSM. But hey, the radio likes so it can't be that bad ??!!??

B00004XPP0|5.0|This contains the first three Star Wars movies ever made.  I'm not going to do a synops of these movies because you can't without reveiling the plot  twists and excitment that makes these movies loved by many.  For those of  you who are die-hard Star Wars fans(like myself)you will want to grab this  because of the special making of Episode II preview.  Anyone not familiar  with these films should look into them.  They are timeless classics and are  the primary reason Episode I was created.  So if you enjoyed Episode I,  you'll love these videos.
B00000J7J4|2.0|..in my rateing now, but that doesnt mean Im not into new-thinking! I  like Santana in every way, and Im not into being boring stubbern  refusing-to-play-new-stuff-of-old-masters... I just HONESTLY like their old  stuff better. But hey! Go ahead and get this CD, offcourse, its Santana,  so it is worth the money!!!
B000002G23|5.0|Can you answer this question by getting the single CD greatest hits or do you need to splurge for this Anthology? I debated this for 6 months (not  full-time), let the songs run through my head and then (with the help of a  gift certificate) went deluxe. If you remember these as albums, then you  cannot give up those catchy oddballs like 'Man in a Suitcase', 'Bombs away'  and dozens of others that you'd miss on the abridged version. I know that  if I had choosen to skimp, I'd eventually have gotten sick of the pop tunes  (too rich) without their more underplayed fillers and quickly shelved the  CD for later days. Interesting to hear live cuts, b-sides and these help  recreate the period, flavor, especially if you've never heard some of them.  Easier to buy if it were $10-15 cheaper but in the end its worth it.
B000001FS3|5.0|I hadn't listened to this album in almost 7 years....not sure what  possessed me to pop it in my player, but I'm glad I did...This is one of  the finest expressions of yearning, searching, and discontent I have ever  heard.  A true soundtrack to the soul-searcher.  From the opening  church-like strains of organ on &quot;Where the Streets Have no Name&quot;  to the final tones of &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;, all the songs  have strike a chord in the heart of a seeker.  It is much more  contemplative than the pop singles it produced, and those singles strike  harder and more to the heart when heard in the context of the entire album.   It truly captures the feeling of unrest that exists and festers in many of  us in the search for meaning and something better.  &quot;A+&quot; many  years after its release....
0805062971|5.0|Fun philosophy...I watched the movie first, and was blown by its thinking  and wit.  Now, I've got the book and it sure made my Fight Club experience  much better.  A quick but compelling read.
B00000J7JO|4.0|Please let me start off by saying that normaly I do not consider myself a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.  I found some of the groups early work to be too  in your face with little substance.  Though the group had quite a  breakthrough in musical style with the early 90s hit Blood Sugar Sex Magic,   I never really saw the fuss over that CD.  My love for Californication is  simple really started with my soon to be wife jamming out on radio to the  first single Scar Tissue, which I admidt is the deepest most introspective  song the band has ever done.  That hard in your face, jangle guitar group  wrote something with some real substance I thought.  I bought her  Californication for Christmas and I must say after hearing this gem a few  times I have grown quite fond of it.  We all know the singles Around the  world, Scar Tissue, Other Side and Californication which are four stong  candidates for best Chili Peppers work to date, but what people whitout  this disk are missing is its allmost perfect flow from track to track.  Its  like a little trip on the road of life and troubles with the band and at  the end with tracks Right on Time and Road Trippin there is feeling of  victory, of togetherness and joy, which I think the members of the band  wanted to get back to.  Californication travels into introspective darkness  to only reveal the light at the end, a Fantastic CD,  all rock fans should  enjoy.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of rap.  Hip Hop is OK but it can be very redundant and  phony.  So it was with a cautious hand that I bought Hill's first solo cd,  but after my first listen, I was amazed!  The cd felt totally real and  un-seflconscious.  I got a sense of a true artist with something to say, a  message to send and not a carbon copy out there going through the motions  without a shread of conviction.  The cd made me laugh, dance, think, cry,  and FEEL som eof what she was singing about.  What more can you ask?  I was  moved.  So glad I bought this cd and listen to it often, sing it in my head  when I'm not.  Anyone with any reservations about this purchase take note:  You WILL be suprised and amazed at her poetry and realness.  Don't pass up  on this opprotunity.  I only hope her follow up can be as incredible as  this.  I'd rank it in the top 5 best albums ever!
1558801871|4.0|You don't have to be a musician who has found himself grappling with the  same fundamental spiritual issues as the main character (and similiar  romantic dilemma) to enjoy this movie.  MO BETER BLUES is one of my  favorite feel good/life lesson movies because of the sheer nobility that  underlies and underscores every nuance of character, plot, situation, and  every note of the music.  Denzel Washington as a self-absorbed, brilliant  trumpeter and band leader, discovering the fragility of his life and the  unrealized strength of his heart; Wesley Snipes as his ambitious, equally  brilliant- and equally alpha male- saxophonist who, though on the surface a  seemingly ungrateful rival ready to break and emerge with his own band,  loves him more than he loves himself;  Turturro as the fundamentally  disinetersted producer, an archtype of the music business; two women- one  who loves the music more than him, the other him more than the music; a  score by Spike's father, musician and composer Bill Lee; performances by  terrance Blanchard and Branford Marsalis... deft screenwriting by Spike- in  one of the few movies he's made where his presence as a character doesn't  take away from the ensemble product... what's not to like in this beautiful  film?  If you are not a jazz fan, trust me, you will become one after  seeing this.  A feel good movie that does not let you down; MO BETTER is,  &quot;Mo' better&quot;.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Not since Starship Troopers have I gone to a movie and been totally impressed with both the special effects and plot.  This movie was the  Sci-Fi sleeper of 2000.  The plot twists were an actual surprise and you  felt something for the characters.  And the aliens were completely  original.  The actors actually acted as opposed to most Sci-Fi filsm were  the cast thinks the special effects and story means that they don't have to  work.  I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD for months.  This is  one disc that won't sit on your rack collecting dust after you watch it the  first time.  If you haven't seen Pitch Black ... buy it.  If you have seen  Pitch Black ... buy it.  If you want to be pleasantly surprised .... buy  it.
B00000IAU3|4.0|Wondering about the title of my review? Well, it's how this album sounds  to me when I listen to it from start to finish. For elaboration, I will  note that it's interesting to me the way that Cd's are arranged. It is  almost as if when they are being produced, the artists put the track that  they know will sell the album up front. This is true with Live's The  Distance to Here, The Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack, among others.<br />In  the case of Dido, she begins with the fantastic single &quot;here with  me&quot;. This is one of the better tracks that I've heard from anyone in a  long time, and I tend to put it on a lot of the compilation discs that I  make for myself from time to time. <br />The problem is that right out of the  starting gate, the album seems to falter a bit. Because following the  excellent &quot;here with me&quot; is the decent &quot;hunter&quot; to the  atrocious &quot;don't think of me.&quot; <br />Fortunately, with that small  stumble, the album continues to improve right up until my second favorite  track on the album, &quot;take my hand.&quot; <br />As far as Dido herself  goes, I predict that we have a major new talent on our hands. She has the  kind of whistful &quot;Sarah Mclachlan-esque&quot; voice that seems to  improve with subsequent releases. <br />I for one hope that I am not wrong  here.
B00001MXXG|3.0|Ok, so eversince I was a really small kid, I always loved  &quot;Ferris.&quot; The movie was always appealing and when I got the DVD I   thought that it would come with some great perks. I mean, this movie is  practically a cult classic, and the DVD should have come with some trivia  or at least a little bit about the actors. All the movie came with was  commentary by John Hughes. I think the DVD should have at least come with  some deleted scenes or outakes. The only good thing about the DVD was the  quality, the sound was great and the picture was absolutely perfect.
6305013578|2.0|OK, I bought this disc--I'm hugely disappointed this wasn't the version that was broadcast on WNET, Ch. 13 in NY about 20 yrs. ago with a sinister  synthesiser-music score. I DO hope at some  point we see either the aforementioned Moroder version on DVD or the one I  saw, or at least SOMETHING resembling the original film!
B00003CXHJ|4.0|I am anxiously awaiting the DVD release of the relentlessly suspenseful WWII Submarine Adventure, U-571.  I saw this film in theaters, and have  since decided that it is one of the greatest adventure films of recent  years.  The performances are exeptional and loyal to their era.  The  charcters are multi-dimensional, and the suspense is nearly unbearable.   <br />Sound plays an unusually key role in the full enjoyment of this movie,  and the DVD release of this film should prove a worthy addition to the  collection of Dolby Digital enthusiaists.  The scenes involving the  depth-charges in particular rely heavily on the use of rear speakers for  full dramatic effect, and with the a good sound system, should improve the  intensity of these nail-biting moments tenfold.
6305627401|5.0|This has to be the funniest movie ever. I'm not a big South Park fan, but  i bought it because i heard so much good stuff about it. Theres so many  jokes in it, i had to watch the movie a couple of times just to get them  all. Each time I watch it it's better then the first. This is a must buy
B000002BUY|5.0|This album may not be new but the music is outstanding and better than alot of the bands out there now. Thanks to the Family Values Tour '98 cd  put out by Korn(SELL-OUTS) I got my first experience of Incubus. I know the  cd has been out for two years already but I think people will like there  style.  There a cooler and more serious 311 if that helps anybodies  thoughts on what this band sounds like.  They are the freshest band besides  the Deftones to come out of the rap/metal scene.  They like the Deftones  don't rely too much on typical rap/metal screams and same guitar riffage.   Brandon Boyd is one of the greatest singers I've heard in a long time  becuase he can actually sing.  Michael Einswinger also happens to be  another standout of the band as he is one of the best new guitarist in the  90's besides Tom Morello.  The best songs on this cd happen to be all of  them while my personal favorites are Redifine, Vitamin, New Skin, Idiot  Box, and A Certain Shade of Green.

0764110284|4.0|Get ready for a memorable showdown! Prepare to meet write off, check in,  chat on, show up, kick back... and even more two-headed creatures that  Anglophone people call Phrasal Verbs!<br />I had sought a textbook specialized  in phrasal verbs for a very long time and this one is the first I found  that deserves this appellation. You will find tons of phrasal verbs in  there, almost 400, among the most popular. <br />The book is divided in 40  units or so containing a dozen verbs. Quick grammar rules relative to  phrasal verbs introduce each unit. Here are treated, little by little, the  following issues which are salient characteristics of the phrasal verbs,  i.e. What is a particle? Is a particle always separable? How to make the  difference between a particle and a &quot;vulgar&quot; preposition? Where  is the accentuation of a phrasal verb? Is it possible to find a common  abstract notion between some meanings of verbs that share the same particle  (e.g. break in, call in, give in)? Yes, you'll have the answers to all  these riveting questions!<br />In each unit, each verb is followed by its  inflected forms (gerund, past and participle). Its different meanings are  described and you'll see that sometimes the particle of a verb can go from  a non-separable state to a separable state depending on the sense given to  the verb! A couple of practical examples illustrates each meaning.<br />Now,  exercises! You'll find a lot of them in the book. Five, six, sometimes more  per unit, including a recapitulation exercise using verbs that you studied  in previous units, so that you can train your memory and check your  knowledge. <br />A unit will take you quite a certain time and sometimes  you'll need up to 1 hour 1/2 if you do them seriously. Perhaps my mistake  was to try hard to complete a whole unit in one time. Because of that, I  admit I felt discouragement from time to time, especially because I had to  interrupt my working session for domestic or professional reasons. If you  don't get time, make two or three exercises a day and the day after, review  the main points and carry on your training. <br />You'll quickly realize that  mastering phrasal verbs is no child's play and requires steady and hard  work. But it's a fascinating world and it's so funny to see the power a  single particle can have over the meaning of a common verb and hence, over  a sentence :)<br />This book is a premiere. If you already enjoyed it and are  looking for a useful complement, buy the Cambridge international dictionary  of phrasal verbs, it will give you a pretty thorough overview of the power  of these verbs. But I would suggest it for people with at least an  intermediate level.
B000008H1Y|5.0|This is not the best Tull simply because there is no such thing as ONE  best Tull. Heavy Horses, Too old to rock'n'roll, Songs from the Wood, War  Child, all of them would qualify. This band is great, nobody sounds  similar. If you don't know Jethro Tull, buy this and prepare to be blown  away!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004R99J|3.0|You can read other's opinion on the actual movie.  I just want to comment  on how terrible the DVD resolution is.  It looks as if we're watching a  well worn video.  Horrible pixalation.  No where up to the transfers of A  Bugs Life or Tarzan.<br />Ugh.
B000000OAN|5.0|Nobody, and I mean nobody, gets even closer to their vocal work. Great songs, all of them with a distinctive feel. You should have it, because I can't imagine why one wouldn't love it...
B000000OQF|5.0|I grew up listening to this.  Read that first sentence again.  I mean, I  GREW UP while listening to this record.  It's pretty darn rough and ragged;  but it is what rock n' roll is all about.  It is my favorite album (I won't  say it's the best...that's a matter of other peoples'  opinions) of all  time.  Every song rocks.  12 years after the fact, I still know every word.
1556154844|5.0|I cannot understand the previous reviewer's complaints about this book.   It is a dense, somewhat demanding read, but I found NO fluff at all - yes,  there is some theory, but I found it all very logically explained and  completely practical and applicable to my everyday life as a programmer.   The careful study of this book will pay great dividends.  I'm largely self  taught, and found I still had a lot to learn when I got my first  programming job.  This book has made my life as a programmer MUCH easier,  and I believe has made me a much more valuable asset to my company.  Most  of the other reviewers have said it all - I cannot recommend this book  highly enough.  Thank you, Steve McConnell!
B0000399WI|5.0|This is truly one of the finest films ever made.  It is sweeping,  heartbreaking and uplifting.  It has surpassed Star Wars as the movie I've  viewed the most times.  I never get tired of it and the emotions never  cease to pull me into those prison walls.  The characters are a part of my  imagination now.  They carry stronger memories than some people I've known.   I can see Andy and Red now on the shore of the Pacific.  Do yourself a  favor, buy this without a doubt.  You will never regret it.
0446677450|1.0|I bought this book because the author was profiled on Oprah.  I was extremely disappointed.  The focus of the book is money and how it leads to  power.  The author disregards education as basically worthless. He gives  examples of how his &quot;Rich Dad&quot; basically cheats people to get  ahead.  I thought it was an example of how to follow someone who has lost  his moral integrity.
0767802470|5.0|The movie is nothing short of incredible. While the mini series was even better since it had more time to recreate those periods of boredom which  are described in the book in such meticulous, almost boring detail, I could  watch the movie on DVD, which meant DD5.1 soundtrack. The sound effects  alone would warrant the 5 stars, but... there is more. The picture. It's  fantastic, but we're used to that on DVD. Nevertheless, I found it quite  exceptional in its quality. The Making of... is a masterpiece in itself,  astounding you with creativity of the movie crew as well as their quest for  ultimate realism.  And then there's the movie itself. You feel as if you  were part of the crew, cursing your heart for beating so loud when there's  an English destroyer above you. You scarcly get to see the sunlight, and  when you do, it appears almost mocking. From the hilarious beginning, free  of any political correctness (no, they're not advertising for Nazis, if  that's what you think) to the end, which is, to put it mildly, shocking,  you never truly enjoy the movie in the traditional sense of the word.  You're scared, wet with sweat, you can hardly breathe...  It's the lost  great Greek tragedy, uncovered only now. You'll turn off your DVD player  sad, perhaps crying, but somehow, you will feel cleansed. And that's what  Greek tragedy is all about.

B00004XPOZ|5.0|Now if George Lucas would get off his bum-bum and release this on DVD!<br />The 20th anniversary series is a great series to the die-hard fans,  who always want to see something different.  Lucas takes advantage of the  situation and creates some extras and adds deleted scenes that were not in  the original movie.  <br />While adding a few seconds here and there, it  provides small changes, but do not add or subtract away from the story.   Star Wars is the greatest affected by the changes (even though Return of  the Jedi has a completely different ending) and Star Wars fans will eat it  up.<br />The picture quality is excellent for a VHS tape and sound is very  good.  However, tape just doesn't have the &quot;sparkle&quot; of DVD, due  to it's lower resolution.  The colors will always look a little washed out  and grainy to the disc.  Also, the pre-movie stuff (interviews, behind the  scenes stuff) should be taken off or put on another tape.  Do I really want  to sit through 15 minutes of Lucas ranting and raving the second time I see  the tape?<br />If you haven't gotten this series yet, now is ther perfect  time.  With Lucas' THX technology, this is a great tape and it's  WIDESCREEN!  However, if you are a die hard DVD fan, you might want to  wait, although no one really knows for how long...Rating: A
0064471837|2.0|I didn't like this book in the slightest. first off it began too quickly. the author just threw you into a world completely different than our own  with very little explanation. He talked about Charter marks and all sorts  of odd things that weren't very well explained. And most of all he didn't  define the problem clearly.  I think Garth Nix had a great idea, he was  excited about all the things he could do with his book and then quickly  drew them out on paper, not bothering ot explain anything to the reader.  don't get me wrong, I'm not one that likes pages and pages of explanations,  but I would like to know a little more about the charcaters, the problem  before he's already searching for an explanation.I wouldn't recomend this  book at all.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|I just want to say that this is one of the best film ever produced with  The most impressive soundtrack I ever heard.
B00001NFCY|4.0|The first Creed song I heard was &quot;Higher&quot;. Just listening to the  music that they make, the voice, and the lyrics made me want to get the CD,  so I did. And I liked it a lot. I like how Creed can make sense and inspire  with rock. They have a good message that everyone should know in all of  they're songs. The only problem that the CD has, which is fine if you like  that style(like me), is that some of they're songs sound too much alike. I  haven't heard they're debut CD, &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, but contunuism  of beats and ryhthms are shown. Though I loved some of they're songs and  they really gave me more respect for Creed after I read some of the lyrics,  as well as made me go around singing &quot;Can you take me higher...&quot;
B00000HYXB|5.0|This has to be Blind Guardian's best.  This CD is full of fantastic guitars, drums, bass, and orchestral type infulences.  If you've never  listened to Blind Guardian before, this CD is a good place to start.  This  is honestly, the most prized CD I own, and my favoutite CD of any I've ever  heard.  I'd give it  20 stars, but even Amazon has it's limits =)
B000001ZS4|5.0|Excellent space music.  The man really made this music accesible to the  masses and we should recognize that to him. He did not invent electronic  music as a lot of people think. To prove my point by 1976 Claus Schulze had  already released: Irrlicht, Cyborg, Blackdance,Picture Music, Timewind and  Tangerine Dream had already released: Electronic Meditation, Alpha  Centauri, Zeit, Atem , Phaedra, Rubycon, Ricochet.Listeners that like the  style of Equinoxe should also listen to those. Claus Schulze's  &quot;X&quot; is also very close to this one along with Vangelis' Albedo  and Spiral. I warn you that you will be surprised. I was. I thought that  Jarre was the beginning and end of electronic music. Not true at all. <br />In  Oxygene and Equinoxe we find tremendous influences from Schulze's Picture  Music and even more from Tangerine Dream's Phaedra and Rubycon. It is very  interesting to explore how different ideas and sounds evolved in the cosmic  music scene throughout the 70's.<br />All in all the music is groundbreaking,  I think that Jarre really took the music one step further than the people I  mentioned already. His sounds are more care free more ethereal and above  all more TRANSPARENT.<br />Schulzes biosphere evolves in the wastelands of an  unfriendly planet. Jarre's Equinoxe is the crystal clear water of a new  promising world. Its really sad that Jarre's experiment did not last beyond  his first 3 albums.<br />Equinoxe and Oxygene should belong to the collections  of all serious listeners of electronic music. Great material.

0671449028|5.0|This is an enjoyable bedtime book with the customary adorable Boynton  fantastic animals.  One and all, big and small, this boatload of animals  undertakes a bedtime routine.  They  wash up, put on pajamas, brush their  teeth and get ready for bed.  Although some parts require a limited  suspension of logic (as adults, we would never exercise in our pajamas on  deck, under the moon, immediately before retreating to the bedchamber), the  flow is rythmic and relaxing.  The biggest problem is that, like all  Boynton books, it is so short that you will read it again and again and  again.  Still, it is not so annoying that you will mind.
B000002LAC|5.0|I wore out the cassette and am upgrading to the CD.  This is a collection  of some of the best harmonies I've ever heard!  These ladies are wonderful  individually!  As a trio, the are fantastic!!
0694003611|5.0|This is a great book. No question.  I heartily recommend the board book version, which will withstand the wear and tear a little better.  <br />Gift  Buyers:  beware.  This is a popular gift choice (there is a nice gift set   -- book and stuffed bunny).  Just remember -- its everyone else's gift  choice, too.  Another great gift book by this author is The Runaway  Bunny.<br />Of course, if you get a non-board book version, chances are that  the extra copies will come in handy, as pages can tear easily.  This is  sure to be a favorite.
6300263673|5.0|It really touched my heart. It made me think of the love I had hoped to  have one day. Baby reminded me of myself. Being the shy person I was. When  I was little I would watch it over and over again. It drove my parents  crazy. But it such a true love story. People say how 'Grease' is the top  dance movie, but I don't think so. It is 'Dirty Dancing' I recommend it to  anyone who is looking for a true love story
B00004THAY|5.0|Don't listen to some of the negativity that has been written in these  reviews about this album.  I think the majority has it right in saying that  this is a very enjoyable album, not to mention a long awaited duo we've  been waiting to hear for a long time.  The negativity seems to surround the  fact that this album is not necessarily the &quot;blues&quot; sound of old.   Well, your right, it is a blending of modern and old school blues that  sounds terrific.  The blues has always been a music that evolves in all  directions.  Just because the sound of this album doesn't fit the  definition of blues to one person, doesn't mean that it isn't the blues.   Remaking some of The King's classics into a more modern sound is great, and  will probably open up the blues to a whole new generation of listeners who  are overexposed to modern music.  So buy this album, sit back and enjoy.   It will take you on a wonderfully, laid-back ride of dueling guitars and  vocals that you will not soon forget.
B00000J2PH|5.0|If I could give this album more than 5 stars, I would! I grew up in the  70's listening to my older sister's copy of Tapestry and eventually had to  get my own when she moved out.  I now need to get this in CD form so I can  listen to it in my car.  I love Carole King, no one can compare to her.  A  must for anyone who agrees with me that the best music was made in the  70's!!
B00004XPP0|5.0|The star Wars Trilogy is more than three great movies in a box. it's a  whole culture that was created by the great Lucas.  Lucas introduced  important social, pshycological, and political ideas in a sci-fi frame that  attracted and still attracts millions of viewers arround the world.<br />Each  character in the movie, including the aliens and the immaginary ones, is a  human archtype that depicts human behaviour,and phsychology.<br />The first  Movie in the Trilogy &quot;Star Wars&quot; was produced in 1978 and it was  recieved by a huge success that 2 days before the premier of the second  part &quot;the Empire strikes back&quot; people were sleeping in front of  movie theatres.<br />It is hard to review the Trilogy without mentioning  It's soundtrack written by John Williams that has become a classic tune  engraved in a whole generation' souls.<br />Even though I doubt that there are  still people out there who didn't see any of the Star Wars trilogy, I  strongly reccomend that you get the set. It's a collectible Item.
B000005IRG|4.0|I may well be a victim of high-end hearing loss, but I have such vivid  memories of the guitar tones on the vinyl album, and I find myself  straining to hear the thrilling edge in Verlaine's and Lloyd's playing on  the CD.<br />I am not an anti-CD warrior - I no longer have a turntable  (although if I still had my original copy of Marquee Moon, I might be  tempted to buy one) - but my impression is that this was a quick-n-dirty CD  release, and I would gladly buy a re-engineered version (esp. with  unreleased songs).<br />It's still a fantastic CD, but I feel like the guitars  were much more gutsy on vinyl. If Richard Lloyd or Tom Verlaine are out  there, I would love to hear either of their opinions.
B00000IPAX|3.0|This CD is definetely not Blink's best. Sure it's a great CD with a lot of  really cool songs but I think Blink became less of a mature fun punk band  and released Enema satisfying little immature boys. The best songs on the  album are Aliens Exist, going away to college and adam's song. Most of the  other songs are about the same dumb thing, althought they sound cool, this  CD isn't quite as good as their earlier stuff- if you have their other CDs  I'd reccomend you buy this CD because in the end it is a good album but if  you're new to the Blink scene and wondering which CD to buy, I wouldn't  start with this one, I'd reccomend Buddha, or Dude Ranch.
B000002LKF|5.0|I have a collection of hundreds of cd's and this is by far my favorite.   The music on this cd is timeless.  This is the very first cd I bought and  it sounds just as good today as the day I purchased it nearly ten years  ago.  Extremely rare are the recordings that you can put on and listen to  the whole way through without skipping tracks, I can honestly say that I  have never done that with this cd.  When I play this, it plays all the way  through.
158234082X|2.0|In VH1's rocumentary series \\"Behind the Music\\" the format goes something like this: rock star struggles; rock star makes it big; rock star self  destructs and nearly dies; rock star gets the band back together; rock star  triumphs but doesn't know why or how considering all the sex, drugs and  rock &amp; roll.   Substitute Chef for rock star, toss in a few useful  tidbits of how to buy a good chef's knife and where not to buy smack on 9th  Ave., and so goes the life and times of Anthony Bourdain in his  \\"tell-nothing\\" book Kitchen Confidential.    <br />     For a book presumably  about food, this one is neither fish nor fowl. Bourdain is all over the map  on this one.  In fact the spine is the only thing holding this book  together. Sometimes it's Bourdain's life stungout, other times it's food,  and sometimes it's how Ecuadorians make better line-cooks than &quot;white  boys.&quot; The only constant is that Bourdain is a bully in the kitchen  with an incredible appetite for cigarettes and an ego the size of  Manhattan.        <br />     Bourdain should stick with the cote du boeuf and  not let those two years at Vassar lull him into thinking he's a writer or  even as interesting as Motley Crue for that matter. Readers are painfully  reminded that indulgences of the 70's and 80's continue to pay dividends in  the 90's and beyond.  By the way, his wife Nancy deserves a medal.
B000002ULO|4.0|When this album came out, I was 13 and just coming off my obsession with  the Beatles. My dad got it, and I listened to it many times. At the time, I  loved the album. Even though now I don't like it as much as I did then, I  still think it's one of Paul's best. &quot;The World Tonight&quot; and  &quot;Young Boy&quot; are great rockers, and the title track is real  Beatlesque. Like all McCartney albums I heard, a couple spots are sorta  weak. &quot;If You Wanna&quot; is a good rocker, but the lyrics aren't that  great. &quot;Used To Be Bad&quot; and &quot;Really Love You&quot; are  throwaways, but the former features Steve Miller. Overall, this is one of  McCartney's best, along with Tug of War and Band On The Run.
0671034065|5.0|It's murder mystery subgenre romantic suspense, but forget all the categories.  It's just a hoot! It has the war been the sexes, the guerrilla  warefare between corporate management and employees, the conflict between  the media and those [un]fortunate enough to be caught in their fifteen  minutes of fame --as well as a serial murderer and the victims caught in  the cat-and-mouse attentions of a twisted personality.  I laughed so hard  while reading this my upstairs neighbor pounded on the floor to object.   When I finished, I lent it to my next door neighbor &amp; she refused to  give it back!  If she wasn't 80, I'd have mugged her for it.  Instead I  bought two more copies --one to keep pristine on my  &quot;collectibles&quot; shelf and one to read -- not to lend, I learned MY  LESSON on that.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.
B00003CX7L|5.0|Toy Story 2 was cute, funny, and interesting. It had quite a cute story  line to follow which made it a hit for both adults and children. Parents-  think you can't sit through an hour and a half of talking toys?Then you'll  enjoy the inside jokes carefully tucked into different parts of the  movie,(clips from Patton, and Jurassic Park, just to name a few).Also the  vocabulary of the toys works well with both parents and kids- Kids  understand it-and Parents catch the little jokes and phrases.All in all,  very cute movie. Rent it, buy it,or just  watch it. Thank you, AL
B00004U3UG|3.0|I now understand why there was an earlier limited collector's edition  which included two versions of the film -- one being the original  theatrical version and the other the director's cut. As some other  reviewers have noted, the &quot;restored&quot; footage/scenes look  absolutely horrible, something like bad video. These occur mostly during  the windmill scene and the long final battle scene. While much is added in  these scenes, it's nothing all that spectacular (nothing to warrant the  severe drop in quality).<br />What I enjoyed more was the deleted scenes  section. This added a great deal of continuity to the film, particularly to  the windmill scene. The whole bit with the mirror in the windmill always  seemed a bit odd, but the deleted sequence which covers the period where  Ash is running from &quot;evil&quot; and later smashes into the mirror has  a nice feel and simply makes more sense. Further, it answers how Ash  recovers his horse.<br />The commentary is solid as various camera and effects  techniques are explained, also the DVD features an innovative film to  storyboard comparison with the storyboards appearing simultaneously in the  lower right-hand corner of the screen throughout the film. Lastly, I prefer  the original theatrical ending, and it should have been included as  well.<br />All in all, I think you should only get this, if you already have  the original theatrical version and want a supplemental disk.
B000001ELF|5.0|My friend first ran off a copy of this album for me, a few months back.  I  have to say I was knocked over with amazment.  Here is the driving force  behind KISS on this album.  With each track you have the hints of what Ace  has added to the band over the years, and what was missing when he left.   There is a certain chemistry among the original four that cannot be  duplicated, so definately listen to Ace's stunning work on this album!
B00004WG28|3.0|Jodie Foster seems like an intelligent woman.  That's why I can't understand why she agreed to star in this vapid remake of The King and  I.<br />The producers tried hard to give it a modern twist.  They even cast  Hong Kong star Chow Yun-Fat as the King in an effort to be politically  correct and give this role to an Asian.<br />Alas, though, the ghosts of Yul  Brenner and Deborah Kerr haunt this production.  The King and I is just too  ingrained in the public consciousness. Most of all, I missed the songs, and  found their melodies playing in my mind throughout.<br />We all know the  story.  Anna, a proper Englishwoman, comes to Siam to tutor the King's  children in 1862. Supposedly this is based on fact, but I understand that  the Thai government has never permitted any of the versions of this story  to be shown in Thailand and, especially in this version, the history seems  too far-fetched to be true.<br />As all movies tend to reflect the times in  which they are made, this version introduces the concept of colonial  oppression, and in several scenes portray the British as pompous  colonialists.  There are also atrocities by the Burmese and a war that is  generated by a traitor general who wants to depose the King.  However,  although there are some spectacular scenes of the palace, we never really  gain  any real insights into the culture of the Siamese people from their  own point of view.<br />Basically, though, the story is a romance. And it  fails here too.  Jodie Foster plays Anna a bit too prim, and her British  accent seems forced.  Chow Yun-Fat is handsome, but lacks the energy of Yul  Brenner, and the sexual tension between Anna and the King just doesn't  sizzle.<br />Some of the conversations between the characters are much too  long and I found myself either looking at the clock or actually dozing off.  This video just doesn't make it.  My advice is to save your money, and buy  The King and I instead.
B00004TLMC|2.0|I have talked to Kubrick fans who just didn't like this movie.  He is a hard cookie to crack, but even for those who normally like his work, this  isn't that good.  I'm sorry he had to end his life with this movie.  The  acting is good and the set design and costumes are worthwhile.  The music  stinks.  If you notice the music throughout a movie, it is subtracting to  the film.  The score's role is to draw you into the film.  This does  nothing of the kind.  It's jarring.  I understand that is what the theme of  the movie is about.  You are jarred from your perception of the world, but  when I'm jarred from the movie I get upset.  <br />The biggest problem of the  film is the overall point of the movie.  Things aren't as you know them to  be and how do you react.  The Matrix is the same thing, only fun and  futuristic.  This is just belly-button watching.  No dramatic conflicts.  I  don't care how the characters react, because psychologically it's not very  interesting.  The overall feeling is &quot;that was great.&quot;  You have  invested too much time for no payoff.  I will not be drawn into liking this  because it is fashionable to like Kubrick, like it is fashionable to rebel,  etc.  I am not anti-intellectual or anti-slow pacing.  I'm  anti-pointlessness.
B00003CWTH|4.0|This three hour film of several intersecting stories regarding various  tortured parent-child relationships set in modern California has some good  things going for it.<br />The directing by Paul Thomas Anderson (of Boogie  Nights fame) is superb.  He knows just where to cut, just where to add  tension, just when to do a close up probing a character's deepest  feelings.<br />The acting was outstanding.  The entire cast, including Jason  Robards, Julianne Moore, Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H.  Macy and John C. Reiley were great.  Each part was meaty, giving the actor  ultimate opportunity to showcase his or her ability.  It's as if the writer  wanted to create good roles, and he certainly did.  Specifically, the roles  for aging men were outstanding.<br />The music was well used too, sometimes  introduced discordantly, creating and enhancing the several themes.<br />In  spite of its length, the movie wasn't boring as the audience kept craving  more and more of the unfolding several stories which were character driven  and intense with startling changes that kept me wide eyed and  interested,<br />However (and this is a big however), there were a few  elements that just didn't work.<br />There was a complicated introduction and  ending which was supposed to illustrate coincidence and destiny which left  me puzzled as to why it was there.<br />I never was able to figure out why the  movie was titled &quot;Magnolia&quot;.<br />And, after all the buildup and  tension and fine acting performances, about three quarters into the movie,  all the characters broke into a song which was totally out of place.  From  then, it was downhill all the way -- with a startling unexpected climax  that came out of the blue with no foreshadowing and made no sense  whatsoever.<br />This film is an intense emotional experience and will  undoubtedly have several well-deserved Academy Award nominations.  Too bad  it just doesn't hold together.<br />Recommended for film buffs for some of the  aspects that are nothing short of pure genius.  But if you're looking for a  story that makes sense, and a feeling of completeness, stay away.r some of the  aspects that are nothing short of pure genius.

B00004U30D|4.0|Sometimes someone is trying to get a message across just too badly.  This was a fine movie with some great writing and acting.  I even like the plot a lot.  I only have two qualms with the movie:<br />1) the alienation in the  suburbs motiff has been done before.  It's just too much.  The plus side is  that the message is multi-layered so it is worth repeat viewing to just  examine what exactly the story is critiquing.  You know it is complaining  about something, but the story is too engrossing to bother thinking too  hard about it on the first viewing.  But after you see it again and you  think about it, I found it too preachy.  In a liberal, holier-than-thou  sort of way.  Maybe I'm reading too much into it, I don't know.  The movie  aimed high and achieved a lot...<br />   That's why I leave off a star.  You could see this coming a mile away.  You  just have to acquainted with leftist dogmas.  You see, everyone who  disagrees or hates gays is just self-repressing their own emotions.   Shallow, shallow, shallow.
B00004TH83|5.0|I like so many others had to hav this CD after hearing &quot; I will Love  again&quot; only once. I got the CD and could not stop listening to it. Not  only do I think she has a voice more muture then Celine (Not that I would  stop listening or buying Celine's CD's because I will always love her  voice) but she writes hr music.<br />If its Lara writting the words then I  have even more respect for her. The words are that of life lived, and love  had and lost and found again. &quot;Love by Grace&quot; is just one  excellent example.<br />Please give this CD a listen it is worth the money, in  my opinion.
6301871952|3.0|i saw this movie hoping it would be like the origanal. IT ISN'T. If you  liked how the first one had some scary parts or if you liked the charm of  the small town , forget about seeing this movie. This time they're in the  big apple and they don't even leave one big building . i liked how it was  nightime in the first time when the magui hatched, but it's daytime when  when these guys hatch. not even scary . not one bit. it's just very very  silly.
B00000255F|5.0|I had heard the song &quot;Born To Run&quot; for the first time ,after  buying the greatest hits album of the boss ,a year ago. Instantly, I  realized it was one of the best I've ever listened to. It kept playing in  my head for days, so I decided I'd better go and buy the whole  &quot;ancient&quot; album.<br />  And so I did. Ever since ,this is one of  my all times favorites CDs. I listen to the songs as often as once a week  ,not wanting to really stop. I highly recommend it to anyone who would like  to get to  know a great performer,  composer and writer.<br />  All of my  matured years I've yearned to discover new superb songs and singers . My  revelation of Bruce Springsteen music is one of my best self-discoveries  yet.

6304288433|5.0|Halloween 2 can be summed up in one word EXCELLENT.  One could go even as  far as to say that it is better than the original.  I certainly can admit  that I tend to watch the second one more than the first because it has a  better ending and a better beginning.  The opening scenes start up right  where the first movie left off and the ending is thrilling.  PLEASE watch  this movie!  Some may say the sequel is not as good as the original but  that is nonsense.  I have watched practically every horror movie more than  once and this is one of the top ten of all time easily.  Besides do we  really watch a horror movie for its acting or ability to fit into popular  culture as critics argue.  The answer is NO.  Halloween 2 is a perfect  example of a great horror movie one which attempts to entertain not win  awards.  After all aren't horror movies the most entertaining and fun to  watch anyhow!

0441172717|5.0|Dune is astounding.  I read it at age 15 from cover to cover.  I'm now 21,  and have just begun reading it for a second time.  Set in science  fiction--but with enough H20 molecule-sized, real-life metaphors to fill an  empty glass--Dune is an almost unbelievable marvel in literature.  The  manifold italicized character thought-processes nestled within allowed me  to truly feel as one with the characters, to actually understand them, and  to almost feel as though it is the year 10,191.  To say this novel has  outstanding character development is like saying the human body has only  1/3 water.  I look forward to re-reading this novel and may post more  reviews in the future.

B00004TH83|2.0|Well where do I start. Celine imitation comes to mind. Celine wanna-be. Celine rip-off. Shall I go on.  The thing is I really thought she had one  original bone in her. Turns out she tries too hard to copy other artists  and it shows. Embarassingly shows. She steals from Celine like crazy, even  the gestures, breathing, and emotives. But she can't pull it off. Her voice  is not as refined or powerful and huge like Celine's. She'll always be  second rate and pales in the shadow of Celine but I guess that's as far as  she will go. Let's be clear here. She's has nothing that could catapult her  into the world of super stars. She's not original or talented enough. But  everyone I guess has their 15 minutes of fame.
B00004R99L|5.0|After buying this DVD for my five year old daughter and watching it a few times myself, I finally get it!  Alice, a young girl, is tired of following  the rules in &quot;her world&quot; and longs to live in a world of her own  creation; a world where there are no &quot;boring&quot; rules to follow and  nothing is as it appears.  However, after Alice's wish &quot;comes  true&quot; she discovers that maybe a world without rules is not quite as  wonderful as she imagined it would be!  Okay, so maybe my daughter doesn't  quite grasp the full meaning of this story, but it doesn't matter.  SHE  LOVES THE MOVIE, ANYWAY!  She sits rivetted to the screen; ethralled by the  silliness, the non-stop action, and all the strange and interesting  characters Alice meets along the way!  In my opinion,Alice In Wonderland is  a fascinating trip through fantasy-land that most young children  (especially girls!)will find absolutely captivating!
1558807381|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It is one of my favorites. However, since it  is one of my favorites, there are things in it that I have discovered. This  version is not the best one out there. If you want to see Legend and live  in the US, I would say look for it to be shown on TV. There is not one  version of Legend that is the best but this is as close as we can get. The  versions released on TV, in the US, and in Europe are in some ways quite  different and each have there good and bad points. The US version, I  understand, is the worst. Since we cannot get the European version here,  the TV version is as good as it gets. Watch that, rent this one, and  compare the two.
B00000J7JO|5.0|WOW THIS CD IS REALLY REALL Y CATCHY IT HAS A LOT OF GOOD FUNK MELODIES  AND CAN SHOW US HOW IT CAN BE REALLY HEAVY BUT REALLY MELLOW ALSO MY  FAVOURITE SONGS ARE AROUND THE WORLD. CALIFORNICATION AND THE OTHER  SIDE<br />BOTTOM LINE GOOD CD ___________
B00000J7J4|2.0|Is this Santana or a bunch of other artists. It seems they took the  commercial safe way out on this one - thinly disguised as contemporary  cultural melange. Pugh. Santana by himself has more soul and integrity.
B000002P5W|5.0|Not the tradidional in-your-face Hendrix work, Axis: Bold as Love stands  starkly apart from Are You Experienced &amp; Ladyland, and defines Jimi as  a full-force artist, not just a guitar hero.  Like his later work with the  Band of Gypsies, this is Funky Stuff, part of what makes Jimi the  mysterious genius that he is.  <br />From the weird intro of &quot;EXP&quot;,  followed by the smooth &quot;Up From the Skies,&quot; to the classic  &quot;Spanish Castle. . .&quot; and &quot;Little Wing&quot; through the  funky &quot;If 6 was 9,&quot; &quot;You Got me Floatin'&quot; and  &quot;Bold as Love,&quot; this is Jimi at his best, running the Guantlet,  with not a toss-off in the bunch.  <br />Axis: Bold as Love goes a little  deeper than the casual Hendrix fan may be used to, but the trip is well  worth it.  Certainly not the first Hendrix album most fans will buy, this  set is a diamond in the rough, if such a thing is possible in the Hendrix  catalogue.  Don't miss it.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia triumphs as gripping human drama,some people think magnolia is one of the handful of true film masterpieces,there are some that say it's a  crapy movie. Dont believe ignorance this film got voted as one of the best  3 films of 1999, and it also got an Academy award nomination for best  original screenplay now the movie is out on vhs and dvd,now you could take  your time and enjoy fine dialogue. I think it's an excellent film, enough  about the movie let me tell you about the DVD it comes in 2  discs full of  great stuff like deleted scenes, making of documentaey, and more Iam not  going to tell you everthing its up to you to find out more or just go on  and get the movie, by the end you will be happy to own Magnolia on DVD.
6303921248|5.0|This classic story of love and marriage has captivated people for years. The beautiful English countryside, the costumes and the wonderful actors  bring this story to life.      At the center of the story is Miss Elizabeth  Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Will they or won't they get together?      I've seen  Sense and Sensibility, Emma and Persuasion. This movie is Jane Austen in  the very best of circumstances. Also my favorite.
1559409010|5.0|Criterion, please make new editions of holy grail and meaning of life asap!  This edition is worth twice the price they charge. You get the  movie, two separate audio commentaries, and a nearly one hour as I recall  &quot;making of&quot; documentary. The beauty of these special editions,  especially monty python, is that the additional material is often as funny  as the feature itself.  You also get a window on some of the  personal/professional conflicts within the troup, as well as learning the  collaborative relationships.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I love this cd!  I play it constantly.  My 2 favorite songs are 'HIGHER'  and 'WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN.'  This cd has more great songs then the ones  listed above.  If you like alternative music this cd is defintely for you.   Human Clay is Creed's best work to date.  So if you like what is on the  radio and the video is appealing to you then buy it already!  What are you  waiting for?
0553108034|5.0|Martin reaffirms that fully developed characters and a well written plot will make any work of literature exceptional, no matter what garb the  author cloaks his story in. Martin bestows a great gift upon the long time  fantasy reader, that there is still hope for this genre. The plot lines and  characters continue to develop from A Game of Thrones; the constant cycle  of deception, alliance, conflict and betrayal can make one's head spin. The  family index is vital to keep track of who's who and where their  allegiances lie. Martin shares a quality of Tolkien's in that  &quot;magic&quot; is not so commonplace that it becomes tiresome or  predictable. Martin uses magic as a mysterious, misunderstood, and uncommon  element and thereby increases the perceived reality of the story. I hope he  writes another dozen.

0446677450|5.0|I was first told about this book by a coworker.  I then camehere to see what others had said about it.  . . . So I took a chance.  It arrived on a Tuesday.  I thumbed through it quickly, and noticed the ad about the CASHFLOW game by the author.  I also noticed the price...I told myself, &quot;For that price, not a chance!&quot; I started the book Wednesday morning.  I finished it Thursday evening.  It was excellent!   A few of the ideas were things I practiced before reading the book, but the lessons really tie everything into a neat package.  I was skeptical in the beginning, so I wasn't expecting the mind-opening experience I received.  On a related note, the timing of my reading this book couldn't be more perfect.  I recently got a new job with a significant increase in salary.  Before reading this, I probably would have put the overflow into my savings account or something silly like that.  Now, I have some REAL tools at my disposal to make my money work for me rather than the other way around.  I'm planning to buy the Cashflow game for my wife and, especially, my children.  Conventional wisdom says that $$ shouldn't change my life...but it did.

B000002WPI|5.0|This is by far the best wu-tang album out. It is their most focused  effort. I think it is a lot better than wu-tang forever becaused it seems  like they put a lot more effort in this one. This cd put the wu in the  spotlight and really made them who they are. If you don't have this go out  and get it!
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD is funny! It trashes boy/girl bands because they are quite pathetic. The Stan is sad. PSA 2000 is proof that he doesn't care what  anybody thinks. It's just like his &quot;Slim Shady LP&quot; CD. If you  like the &quot;Slim Shady LP&quot; you have to get this!
B00004U3UG|2.0|It is unfortunate that I have to agree with previous reviews listed here that this particular version of Army of Darkness is not the one to get. I  already owned the 'theatrical edition' (also available here at Amazon - the  cover is different to this one) but bought this as well just to get the  extra 15 minutes of footage and deleted scenes. This was somewhat of a  mistake.<br />The menu is the same as the theatrical edition, with just a few  changes to content. The deleted scenes I did find amusing, particuarly the  &quot;windmill scene&quot; which adds 6 extra minutes to Ash's growing  insanity, very much in the style of Evil Dead 2 (quiet, no dialogue, blank  stares..). Also the original beginning gives a darker impression of the  movie, like ED2 - I would assume both of these were removed simply because  of that fact; Universal wanted to market this movie as a seperate  entity.<br />The quality of the movie varies. With the scenes that are the  same as the theatrical edition, the quality is perfect. However, when a  &quot;directors cut&quot; bit kicks in, the entire scene drops into bad  rental VHS quality. This simply is not acceptable, and I don't see how  Bruce Campbell could put his name on the back of this (perhaps they only  showed him the scenes from the other version). It is good to see these  scenes, but unfortunately it is hard to watch them. I know I will only  watch this version of the DVD when I want to see the extra footage  itself.<br />Another bad point is the soundtrack. The theatrical edition has a  full 5.1 soundtrack, yet only the menu in this edition exhibits this  quality - the movie itself is presented in 2.0 Surround sound.<br />So once  again, do yourself a favour and buy the theatrical edition of the DVD  listed above, and not THIS one unless you have money to burn and really  want to see the extra footage.
B00000JCOV|5.0|When the song (sic) started to play i was blown away by the intensity.  i  came to the conclusion when the cd was done that slipknot was my new  favorite band. this cd is really brutal and intense. it is original also  especially with the 2 percusionists and the drummer joey (who is extremely  good). also this isnt ur average howling shouting metal singer. corey  (singer) could sing regularly and scream good to. the guitarists are good  too playing riff after riff. bassist has good sounds.sampler makes some  crazy sounds mostly in songs:scissors, prosthetics.
6300183211|2.0|After reviewing The Deer Hunter, I was shocked when they reccomended Scarface!<br />Based on Al Capone, but instead of alcohol, it's cocaine,  fictional Cuban Tony (Al Pacino) rises from petty crook, to rich drug  dealing murderer with a soft spot for his sister (Geena Davis).<br />Tony  moves to Florida with a couple of his best buds and goes to work for major  criminal Frank (Robert Loggia), but falls in love with his wife (Michelle  Pfeiffer).<br />After being sent on a job to a cocaine factory with Frank's  long time companian and now dead employee (F. Murray Abraham), Tony works  out a deal with the owner of the factory (I like calling it that) and  steadily rises.<br />Supporting characters are weak, however accents are good.  Acting is bad however everyone must make a bad film.<br />SCARFACE is a  violent, poorly acted attempt at an epic crime.<br />Also weakening the film  is the fact the it was made in the eighty's and the soundtrack and score  make you sick.<br />Nevertheless, certain parts of Scarface, such as the  storyline, which could have been made into a great film, make it worthwhile  for a peek.
B00004U9MS|2.0|I know saying this now might eventually cause a riot, but Coldplay ARE copycats!  So are Travis, so are Muse, at least Doves do have some degree  of originality and dignity. Everybody is raving about the album now, I've  listened to this for a few times, tried to make myself like it. Well, the  conclusion is... they are just ripping off Radiohead, not in the same way  as Nirvana ripping off the Pixes,but in a way that makes the album sound  cheap,  maybe(? ) Coldplay will be the next Radiohead, they do make a  few good tunes here and there, but NOT NOW!  There are just toooooo many  'the next Radiohead' around, Travis, Muse...even Grandaddy(at least they  try to make another 'OK Computer' instead of making another 'The Bend') now  there is Coldplay. A parade of wannabes. It's time!  Radiohead is releasing  'Kid A' soon, the landscape is going to change again!You don't believe? We  will see!
630242335X|2.0|Spoilers within, beware. <br />Here's a few of the things that bug me about ST6 now that I'm a bitter old man:<br />Sulu's ship just happening to be hit  by an energy wave that apparently traveled faster than light.  Computers/scanners that can't tell whether two photon torpedos were fired  from someplace *outside* the Enterprise, but can detect a little piece of  Velcro from a hundred light-years away. Communications officers so stupid  they have to look through books--and old books at that--to translate  Klingon. (I thought \\"we'd never been this close...\\" so who went  to the Klingon Public Library? And weren't they close enough to beam  Tribbles aboard a Klingon cruiser in TOS? ) Line after endless, aggravating  line of unnecessary, distracting literary references--at the expense of  real dialogue. The thrilling \\"searching through closets and dresser  drawers\\" scene. Valeris just happening to frame the only Enterprise crew  member with size 19 feet. Assassins so stupid they hide bloodstained  uniforms in a ventilation duct in the Officer's Lounge. Conspirators so  stupid they hide assassins' bodies in main turbolifts. The shapeshifter  inexplicably shifting into Kirk's form...and then not shifting back--why?  So we could have a nifty shot of Kirk disintegrating for the movie  trailers. Oh, and it was EXCELSIOR that was scouting out the \\"gaseous  planetary anomolies,\\" not Enterprise. This is not nitpicking. These  are major plot points--and I hate to say it, but they're really quite  stupid. Last but not least: UHURA. Not UHURU. Sorry if I sound a little  cynical and jaded, but the best part of this movie was the smarmy  manipulative pap--and that was smarmy and manipulative! I love classic  Trek. But ST:TUC doesn't do it for me anymore. Now pass the Romulan Ale. I  gotta get tanked.
B00003CWNR|5.0|This is a beautiful transfer onto disc for a wonderful classic movie!
B00004XPOZ|5.0|O.K. First off I'd like to say that George Lucas only repaired the old trilogy he didn't ruin it! Watching the original version of Episode IV is  boring and the special effects are pure cheese, when watching the special  edition your watching what Lucas invisioned when he wanted to release the  film back in 1976. I think it's great, it ties with episode I. Imagine if  you show'd your kids the original versions and explained to them why there  weren't any CGI creatures in the last three films! I actually think that  Lucas could've done a better job in restoring some other scenes that  weren't tweeked for the Special Editions. Episode IV needs more CGI shots  especially at the Battle of Yavin scenes, the CGI scenes blended with the  oldschool special effects are pure cheese (this is the slowest episode in  the Trilogy) it needs something to tweek it up. Episode V needs more CGI  creatures, and the asteroid scene needs to be fixed (this one lacks in  creatures). Episode VI, do something about the Rancor, the matte lines kill  the whole experience, digitise the speeder chase on Endor. I'm just worried  that the Original Trilogy wont blend with the Prequel Trilogy. I'll watch  Episode I-III in the near future then pop in IV and say to myself  &quot;what the f@#k happened here?&quot;
1881273156|5.0|Gary Chapman's theory of the five love languages is as follows: each of us  has a &quot;love tank&quot; that needs to be filled.  If our love tanks are  full, we are happy, fulfilled, and have a positive view of our  marriages/spouses.  If our love tanks are not full, we feel empty, unhappy,  and have a less positive view of our marriages and spouses.  Each of us has  a primary &quot;language&quot; of love, which we both speak when we give  love, and in which we expect to receive love.  The five languages are:  Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Acts of Service, Gift Giving, and  Physical Touch.<br />The theory behind these five love languages is, in order  to completely fill your spouse's love tank, you need to figure out which  language they respond to most, and then begin expressing love to them in  that way, even if it isn't your natural inclination to express love that  way.  When you do this, they will automatically feel much more loved, and  they will reciprocate, thus, your marriage will stay much more fulfilling,  and you will be able to share love much more effectively.<br />Chapman's  theory has been proven by hundreds of couples to be a valid one, and the  book almost reads like a &quot;Get Rich Quick&quot; pamphlet for Love.  However, according to Chapman (and all the positive reviews for this book),  this theory really works, and can &quot;radically change your  marriage.&quot;<br />Five stars!
B0000062GK|5.0|In my humble opinion...the greatest album in the history of music. And cut  number 4, &quot;Love Thing&quot; the most emotional guitar playing in the  history of the 6-string.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album is one of the best Metallica albums ever put out.  First of all, all of Metallica's greatest hits are on it.  As an extra bonus  Metallica made two new songs for the live album.  Michael Kamen and the  band combined the two richest types of music to make one intense sound.  The orchestra added dimension to all of the songs.  Here's a breakdown of  what I thought about the songs. The concert starts out with an exciting  intro by the orchestra only, The Ecstasy of Gold. From here it moves into  the Call of the Ktulu.  Each member of the band is introduced one at a time  until it explodes into a loud rock song played mostly by the orchestra.  This to me is the best part and perhaps the greatest song on the album.  Master of Puppets was greatly improved by the orchestra as well as Of Wolf  and Man. Fuel, an intense song to start with, becomes more powerful with  the addition. No Leaf Clover is a great and powerful song not previously  released before S&amp;M. Devil's Dance is pumped up as well. Bleeding Me  becomes a very moving song with the sound of violins added to song. CD 2  starts out with Nothing Else Matters which already had orchestration when  it was originally released in Black.  It was even better on S&amp;M. For  Whom the Bell Tolls, one of the best, is also improved and Hetfields deeper  growls and better singing also make it better than the original. One I look  at as the biggest success of this album.  This song was musical to start  with, but when the orchestra was added, it was even better. Enter Sandman  was the only non-success to me.  The pumping guitars of Metallica's  greatest song ever were drowned out.  This one was a failure. The concert  ends with a the powerful speedmetal song of Battery.  Not improved by the  orchestra but still good, it made a very powerful ending. If you don't own  any Metallica CD's you should start out with this one.  This was my first  album and now I am a huge fan of Metallica and I own every CD.
0790731983|5.0|Cabaret is if not THE best musical, but certainly one of the best musicals ever made. The story takes place during World War II in Nazi Germany. Liza  Minelli plays Sally Bowles, an American who performs at a local Kit Kat  Klub, and who has an English professor staying with her who is a bisexual.  The movie mostly focuses on their relationship and Sally's life outside and  inside the club. Cabaret was an excellent musical and not just because of  the music in it, but because of the story and of the history it takes place  during. It does have some excellent musical numbers in it, including The  Money Song, and the title song. A must watch for everyone!
B000001DYJ|3.0|This album is an example of a band trying to capitalize on past successes  and failing, to say the least. Alive! and Alive II were fine efforts from a  great band, but Alive III didn't measure up to my expectations. Alive III  probably would appeal to younger Kiss fans who have no recollection of the  band which featured Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter. It provides an inkling of  what the band used to give fans with classics such as &quot;Detroit Rock  City&quot; and &quot;Deuce,&quot; but I think hard-core fans of the  original band would agree with me that these songs were not well-delivered  this time around. Furthermore, although Eric Singer may be able to emulate  Peter Criss' style on the drums, and while I applaud the effort given by  Bruce Kulick on lead guitar, he's no Ace Freshly -- one of the key  components that helped draw fans to Kiss early on and which kept them  coming back. Kiss is a a great band, but Paul and Gene should have quit  with the live albums while they were ahead.
B00002Z88D|5.0|1 The Ecstacy of Gold -classic metallica right here starting off with this great score from the good the bad and the ugly...the best opening for a  concert ever ( I wonder why they didn't do it for the one I went to...)  Rated: 10/10<br />What follows is one of the greatest cds ever recorded, and  it's all done LIVE! Yep that's right, Metallica, unquestionably the  greatest live band of all time has released a greatest hits album. And they  thought it would be cool to have a symphony play with them. Good idea, this  is not metallica, it's beyond metallica, beyond anything you've ever heard  before. Classic classical metal (with classical overtones) hehe :)<br />2 The  Call of Ktulu -This version sounds absolutely incredible with the symphonic  additions, and the ending, with all that tasty bass, is a real suprise.  Rated: 10/10 (Better than Ride the Lightning version)<br />3 Master of Puppets  -One of Metallica's best classic songs sounds beyong amazing with the  classical touches, especially during the light riffs in the middle of the  song... Rated: 10/10 (Better than Master of Puppets version)<br />4 Of Wolf  and Man -Fun version of this song, especially with the crowd interaction  with James and Jason. The howling sounds too cool. Rated: 10/10 (Better  than Metallica version 1991)<br />5 The thing that should not be -Ok, I'm a  huge fan of this song, but it still sounds great here. If you love this  song, you will go nuts with this version. Rated 9/10 (Better than Master of  Puppets version)<br />The next three song on this CD are the three best tracks  I've heard Metallica burn onto a CD. They are simply breathtaking:<br />6 Fuel  -Gimmie fuel gimmie fire, give me that which I desire!  OMG this song  rocks so much I just can't describe it...sorry Rated 11/10 (that is good)  (Oh, and it is better than the Load version...)<br />7 The memory remains  -This is the single greatest track ever recorded on a tape, LP, CD, LD,  DVD, MD, 8 track, VCR or what have you. This is what entertainment is all  about, I get so pumped up from this song I really cannot contain myself to  one fixed point (In short; I go crazy and hurt anybody remotely next to me)  The reload version wasn't the best song ever, but this IS the best TRACK  ever recorded... Rated 12/10 (Very not bad)<br />8 No Leaf Clover -Na nanana  Na na na na...sorry. So this is the new metallica huh? Well I couldn't be  more impressed, this song is great and so is Jamez vocals. Rated 11/10  (YEAUH!)<br />Ah, now we can take a little break for that glimpse of  insanity...<br />9 Hero of the Day -This version may or may not be better than  the Load version. I think the load version was a little more subtle which  suits the song better, but this version is still good stuff Rated:  9/10<br />10 Devil's Dance -This version of the reload song is a huge  improvement! The whole basic riff of the song sounds so much better with  the ochaestra behind it. Rated: 10/10<br />11 Bleeding Me -I like this song, I  really do, but after all these amazing songs, I just can't hold out any  longer, I get a little, well bored. Still a great song, I think the load  version was better. Rated: 9/10<br />I'll stop there since I think all you  need is to be convinced that the first CD rocks and you will get the double  CD set. The 2nd CD, while not as amazing as the first, has some great  moments peaking with For Whom the Bell Tolls (YEAUH!) and that new tune  -Human. Well, I'm pooped, I think I'll listen to some lighter music now. I  like to call it &quot;recovery music&quot;.is is what entertainment is all  about, I get so pumped up from this song I really cannot contain myself to  one fixed point (In short; I go crazy and hurt anybody remotely next to me)  The reload version wasn't the best song ever, but this IS the best TRACK  ever recorded... Rated 12/10 (Very not bad)<br />8 No Leaf Clover -Na nanana  Na na na na...sorry. So this is the new metallica huh? Well I couldn't be  more impressed, this song is great and so is Jamez vocals.

Well, I'm pooped, I think I'll listen to some lighter music now. I  like to call it &quot;recovery music&quot;.
6304057709|5.0|I honestly loved this movie from start to finish again and again. I rented  it several times and then bought my own copy once I realized it would  probably be cheaper that way. :) Its very close to the jane austen novel  and a real treat to watch. I thoroughly reccommend this to everyone, jane  austen fan or not.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I love Eminem to death! I am a huge fan and have like 24 cds of him. I  love this cd a lot. Honestly it is really harsh, but it will make you laugh  your head off. It shows all sides of him and he'll make you laugh at things  that you never thought that you would. Critics are tearing this cd appart,  but it's just because he is brutally honest. So, if you like humour,  seriousness, don't mind violence, then this is a SUPER cd for you!!!
6303965415|5.0|I have honestly nver read the book, for which some Austen fans will hate  me:). But ever since I read and watch pride and prejudice I've been hooked  to jane austen. From northanger abbey to Emma and Mansfield park I've loved  each and every story. I rented, then bought this movie about six months ago  and have watched it quite a few times since. Its interesting and well-acted  with on location shots and scenery in England. I thoroughly reccommend this  movie.
6303481272|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this film is not for the timid. Anime has always shown a tendency to be quite violent, but this film is possibly one  of the most violent anime films on the market. My friends and I found  ourselves rewinding the tape several times while saying, &quot;did I really  just see that.&quot; The animation is great, and the storyline is more  complex than you would expect. While Jubei is a great character, the real  stars of this film are the villains with their various abilities and  powers. If you havent done so, and you like this style of animation, then I  think you will enjoy watching this film over and over again.
6302719631|3.0|I thought that northanger abbey was actually a very good movie, but, while  it had some scenes where it was like the book, it was overdramatised and  things were added in until it became more gothic fantasy than jane austen  originally put it. I saw the movie before I read the book, and I enjoyed it  very much, but when I read the book, it was plainly different. So here's  what I reccommend. This is a five star moive if only it isn't supposed to  closely resemble the original book. The two are very good by themselves,  but not together. :)
B000002IO1|5.0|I sure miss the mature, rockin' talented women of the 70's, 80's to late 80's ( Heart and Pat Benatar specifically).These gals could belt out with  the vocals and their wild feminine charms without ever becoming sugar  coated caricatures of pop music...<br />Then,Myles shows up to prove that they  still existed towards the closing of the 80's.After Alannah's explosive  chart topping album from '89 it seemed she was destined for more  success.After the Black Velvet hit, she released a couple of lesser well  known and harshly critiqued albums...<br />Alannah Myles debut, containing  Black Velvet ,showcased her as a sexy rock n' roll siren with sultry  throaty vocals without coming across as dry sandpaper but rather smooth  silk. There were no filler tracks or songs penned at the last minute. Each  song, while collectively they worked together, had it's own unique  flavor...
B00002Z88D|5.0|I have been a Metallica fan for years now. They too have been around many  years, but this CD start's a new beginning. This is a CD that is better  than you expected! I believe that some songs on this CD are better than the  original! Eg &quot;Mastor of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Battery.&quot; The  power on &quot;M.O.P&quot; is unbelievable. This is, and will remain my  Number 1, favourite CD. I'm looking forward to their new CD. METALLICA  ROCKS!!!  Buy this CD where ever you may roam! IT'S WORTH IT!                                Rock on.

0780020685|5.0|Well, that's the only comment I can add to all the praises that I  wholeheartedly agree with.  Everyone from Shmura and Mifune, to all the  extras, perfectly fit in this movie.  If I had read this as a book  beforehand, I couldn't have even imagined who look their part more.  Also  would like to add that it's quite unfair to trash The Magnificent Seven in  light of this movie.  Asking that movie to live up to the standards of  Kurosawa's masterpiece is like asking a little league player to hit a home  run off of Pedro Martinez.
0553502271|2.0|I own and have read all 11 books by John and personally feel this was far  from his usual standard.Perhaps the pace of a book a year, ala Danielle  Steel is too much for many writers -- even a great one like John Grisham. I  have read a lot of criticism regarding &quot;The Brethern&quot;, however I  enjoyed it much, much better than &quot;The Testament&quot;.
078322818X|5.0|This film is packed with wonderful moments that reveal a yearning for a  time gone by and innocent metaphors.<br />Richard Dreyfus is the soul of the  film as events seem to revolve around his character. How many times has  anyone walked down the hallway of their old High School past their old  locker? <br />The emerging hormonal energy of the teens that populate the film  are on display..with comedy, hi jinx and regret. My favorite scene is where  Dreyfus encounters the Wolf Man in the studio.  The Wolf Man does not admit  to being himself and tells Dreyfus that the Wolf Man is on tape. After a  sticky handshake Dreyfus leaves only to see the Wolf Man carry on through  the glass  (Rock On ).<br />If you are of that era then you are also in this  film of Universal Language. Unique
B00001OH7P|5.0|...what's the concept! Like the Beatles SGT. PEPPER, what started out and what was revered as a great concept album has fallen from such lofty heights to be just another album of really great songs. In the end, that's maybe how Mr. Bowie would have preferred it. For the three years after this, the Ziggy Stardust persona would take over and eventually suffocate Bowie's creativity. But what really may be a long-running musical sham is really just a wonderful album in disguise. At the time, David Bowie had hit a creative peak, and he was running all 6 cylinders, so he thought why not leave England and go global, which he did. The genre he'd spawn, called glam rock, would eventually be remembered for just bringing theatre, make-up, and what else, glamour into the heretofore pedestrian genre called rock and roll. And if there is a reason ZIGGY should be remembered as a landmark in rock history, that is it. Other than that, it's still a wonderfully crafted album that basically saw Bowie electrify HUNKY DORY. &quot;Five Years&quot;, which could have been a shoo-in on that album, features one of Bowie's most affecting vocal performances and is positively the greatest opening song in rock history. That standard is followed on &quot;Moonage Daydream,&quot; &quot;Starman,&quot; and the greatest closing song in rock history &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Suicide&quot;, still frightening after all these years. That's the ballad side of the album, the songs that really defined glam rock were upbeat rockers like &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Suffragette City&quot;. Bowie's &quot;Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am&quot; on the latter is still as leeringly sexy as ever, and probably the best dance song Bowie ever created (no, it's not &quot;Let's Dance&quot;). Pardon my proselytzing throughout most of this review, but I just thought I should use this as more than just a review for an album, but also my philosophy on how it has been remembered in music history. Those who love or hate my reviews can expect more of the same.can expect more of the same.
B00004TJTQ|5.0|There is not much I can add to the wonderful reviews that have already been written here.  It is a MUST OWN movie and adults will enjoy it every  bit as much as the children will.  Years from now I will still laugh and  cry watching this wonderful video.  It is a story that will never grow old.   You should also read the book...and I'm sure Amazon has one to sell!
B000001FI7|5.0|Like almost all other reviewers before me, I love this CD. Beth Gibbons  voice is so unique!  Sometimes I wonder, though, if this truly is her  voice, or if most of it is due to technology.  Nevertheless, it is a great  CD and I encourage anyone who has doubts to wipe 'em all away and buy it.   After all, if you find you don't dig this scene there's always something  called a &quot;REFUND&quot;...
B000002P48|5.0|For those of you who know and appreciate Lynyrd Skynyrd, this album is a  must!  For the rest of you, please don't deprive yourselves!  There is a  reason this band is still around after almost 30 years -- they are simply  the best honest, down-home, Southern Rock band of all time! Heart-tugging  vocals, amazing guitar playing and awesome melodies that will keep you  coming back for more.  Don't miss this one -- or any of the other Skynyrd  albums either!
6304143184|1.0|I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and i asked myself : &quot;what is it about ?, is it a joke ?, why so much fuss about nothing ?&quot;. The movie  is very weak, there is neither acting nor plot in it. The alien looks like  my old carpet. I think we could make a better alien with computer special  effects today. Have you seen aliens in Independance Day ? these look like  real aliens ! The movie is very representative of the eighties, that is to  say with an american family of the middle class, with a good dog and a  great barbecue. The music is often tearful with a lot of tremolos. I don't  think honestly that E.T could be appreciated by children nowdays, the poor  E.T looks like a fake doll. Poor E.T, if i were him, i would go home  immediately.
0767830547|5.0|First, a phenomenal faux pas on the part of Columbia Tristar Home Video's marketing department: on the cover of my copy of this landmark movie is a  quote from Liz Smith: &quot;Jodie Foster is Delightful.&quot;  If there was  a more inappropriate term for anything about this movie, it is  &quot;delightful.&quot;  For anyone who hasn't yet seen this modern REAL  horror masterpiece, it is one of the most effective studies of frustration,  isolation and suppressed (for the most part) anger in today's world that I  have seen on film.  And, the movie works brilliantly despite all the  strikes against it; Paul Schrader's psychodrama/part pulp creation may have  fallen apart, were it not for Martin Scorsese's adept direction and the  gritty, committed performances of the lead characters, not in the least  Robert DeNiro as the alienated, deadened ex-Marine Travis Bickle.  I am  always fascinated by movies that have major contrasts in tone and style  within them; consider the scenes with Albert Brooks and Cybill Shepherd at  Palatine Headquarters, played at a (bad) sitcom level, then contrast them  with the hyper-realistic scenes of Travis's customers (Scorsese has a  bravura cameo as a murderously jealous husband), Harvey Keitel's greasy  pimping duties, the final massacre, and for me the most unexpected and  shocking display, the aftermath of the convenience store robbery which  Travis is involved in.  This is the stuff of nightmares.  The movie is also  populated with wonderfully odd supporting characters, including Travis's  fellow cabbies who have a camaraderie which feels real, and the  fast-talking gun salesman who brings his arsenal to Travis's apartment for  a sale.  After you've viewed it a few times (if you're so inclined!),  questions come to mind:  Why does Betsy even give Travis the time of day,  especially after their incredibly awkward &quot;lunch&quot; together?  Why  has Travis's character been written as SO clueless, sometimes distracting  to the point ofamusement?  Doesn't Bernard Herrmann's loungy main theme,  complete with emoting saxophone, seem at odds with the unadorned realism  the movie is presenting us?  As it is, though, these aspects,  contradictions and all, are what make &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; a unique and  unforgettable experience.  There are a hundred different things worth  commenting on, from the look of the film, to the ironic &quot;message&quot;  of the movie, etc.  But, for those with the mettle, this is one of the  best, and should be seen for those with any interest in contemporary  cinema.  And, oh yes, Jodie Foster is as delightful as any pre-teen  prostitute could possibly be.
6305750750|5.0|Kick-butt lightsaber duels, adrenaline pumping podraces and exhilarating space fights push this film to the brink of a billion stars! Just awesome!
B000002HK4|5.0|A Change Of Seasons, is a re-working (kinda) and completion of the magnum  opus orignally composed during the Images and Words sessions. This version  has both lyrical and musical additions and clocks in at an astounding  23:06. ACOS is just like all of DT's material, an lesson in musicianship  along with lyrics and vocal delivery that gives it more heart and substance  than most material in the past 10 years. Screw Nirvana, these guys are  better suited to be the voice of our generation. John Petrucci (guitar),  Mike Portnoy (drums, lyrics), John Myung (bass), and Derek Sherininan  (keyboards)are each virtuosos a their instruments and continue to shine in  ACOS, while James LaBrie really stretches his vocal range to throw you head  first into Portnoy's story. My only complaint with ACOS is that because of  the way it seems that James annunciates certain letters, some of the lyrics  sound like entirely different lines and meld together and are not  understandable, but this only happens rarely during the song. Part 2 of the  disc comes from the &quot;UNCOVERED' show the guys played in early '95. The  covers of progressive and hard rock classics, put a DT spin on the songs  and make them a lot more fun than the originals. (I can't listen to the  orignal Achille's Last Stand Anymore, this version is that much better)  In  closing this, like all DT stuff is an excellant work that should be  enjoyed, im sorry that not more people appreciate the kind of music that  bands like DT and Spocks Beard are making. Carpe Diem my friends.
0780627024|5.0|I think this is one of those films that has to be seen twice to be liked,  you know? The first time I saw this film, I wasn't very impressed. But  after watching it again, I was not impressed, I was amazed! Pleasantville  is a highly enjoyable, poignant, witty and unmissable drama that turned out  to be one of the best films I saw in 1998! The screenplay is highly  original and unfortunately turned down by the Academy, the whole cast give  excellent performances, and Gary Ross's direction is noticeable and  effective.<br />I rate Pleasantville 9 out of 10. It is one of the best films  of 1998, and very close to been a modern day-masterpeice!
0788821075|5.0|This modern day Cinderella story is simply a timeless classic. Charming in its story and likewise the two leading stars this is a surprisingly  touching old fashioned comedy. The timing is just right throughout the film  and all the players are excellent. There is great chemistry between Richard  Gere and Julia Roberts in roles that seemingly were tailor made for them.  Truly wonderful stuff!
B00000K2SC|5.0|The first time I saw The Matrix I was bored out of my life. But recently it was advertised on cable and I couldn't help having another look. I was  absolutely breathtaken! I think this film has to be seen twice to be liked,  because now I agree with those who say The Matrix is one of the best  science fiction films of the century! It is smart, engaging, fun,  action-packed and thrilling entertainment that impressed the living  daylights out of me.<br />I rate The Matrix 9 out of 10. It is a movie you  just can't miss, so anyone who hasn't seen The Matrix, see it now!
6300263673|5.0|Dirty Dancing is one of those timeless classics that you simply just can not get bored of. How wrong i was to think that this was just going to be  another sentimental and sloppy teen movie when it was first released in  1987. The story is charming of a sweet but headstrong teenager who comes  from a wealthy family who falls in love with dancer, Patrick Swayze. The  chemistry between these two stars are great, the dancing is electric and  the soundtrack is pure magic. The ending is classic!
6304938276|5.0|Scream 2 does not quite pass the high standards of the first film, but it  sure is an awesome sequel! The cast all do great jobs, Neve Campbell is  incredible, Courteney Cox is hilariouslly scared, David Arquette is quiet  and cool, and without Sarah Michelle Gellar as a supporting female, the  movie would not of been complete. The mix of genre's in this movie make it  even better, it is a hilarious comedy, a horrific horror, a mysterious  mystery and a great sequel. Don't miss it.<br />I rated Scream 2 10 out of 10.  And I know many people would not agree with this rating, and I do not  believe it is an absolute masterpeice, just one of my personal favourite  films.
0887307280|5.0|If you own a small business or are considering starting one, put this book  at the top of your \\"must read list.\\"  As a personal coach, I recommend the  E-Myth Revisited to our entrepreneurial clients, especially if the business  has \\"taken over the client's life.\\"<br />Gerber's E-Myth Revisited offers  salient points with the most important being, \\"Work ON your business not IN  it.\\"  We are introduced to three working personalities:  1) the  entrepreneur who always has ideas,  2) the manager who keeps everything  organized,  and 3) the technician who knows that \\"If it's going to get done  right, I'd better do it myself.\\"  Through the eyes of a business  owner/client, Gerber unfolds the story that allows us to see the importance  of each personality preference and the necessity for balance between them.   We also see the different stages of business growth and come to appreciate  the benefits of implementing systems at the beginning of developing a  business.<br />Humor throughout the book makes this an enjoyable read, and as  I tell my clients, savor your chuckles when you find Gerber describing you  almost perfectly.
0783235607|5.0|There is hardly anything to dislike about Psycho. The performances from Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are breathtaking, and the screenplay and  cinematography are absolutely incredible. The direction from Alfred  Hitchcock is excellent, this is easily his best work yet, and you can tell  it is the one he worked most hard on.<br />Psycho is a brilliant, ingenius  peice of work that anyone could easily call a masterpeice. The best film of  the 60's, and a definite runner up for Best Horror Film of All Time, Psycho  gets a 10 out of 10 rating from me!
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is the best Peppers CD ever!   I bought this after hearing Scar Tissue, Around the World and Otherside.  After that I figured &quot;god  damnit, I HAVE to get this CD!&quot;  So I did, and after listening to it  for the millionth time, I was still just as pleased with it as I was the  first day I bought it.  It is the best CD of all time.  It got me in to  RHCP.  I also went off and bought Blood Sugar Sex Magik after hearing this,  and again, 5/5, I was really happy... but that's in another review.  So, if  you have not bought any Chili Peppers CDs, and are thinking about it, with  no hesitation, get this one first, without a doubt!  I am now hooked on  RHCP, I love them, they are my favourite band ever, I have heard EVERY song  of all their albums, I know tons about them now, and it's all because of  this one CD!   Now, just to finish up, I'd like to say, Anthony's voice  has never been better, and his lyrics are outstanding.  John always lays  down the best guitar stuff possible (I can play most of all his stuff on my  guitar), and he really pleases me... Flea, Flea is just amazing!  The band  would never be the same without him.  He is the best bass player in the  world, sorry to our runners up :), some will know who they are.  And Chad,  he's ALWAYS excellent, he's always getting better too, amazing drummer, and  with 4 awesome talents like that, this is what you get!
0790738139|5.0|L.A. Confidential is almost a completely faultless film. The cast is great. Kevin Spacey is awesome, New Zealander Russell Crowe is amazing, Kim  Basinger had an Oscar well-deserved and James Cromwell is as mysterious and  interesting and he needs to be. The direction and writing from newcomer  Curtis Hanson is remarkable. He shows effort in directing, and his script  is well thought-out, engaging and full of effort. <br />I gave L.A.  Confidential 9 out of 10. It all areas it excels with effort, and it is  easily one of the best films I saw in 1997.
0800141326|2.0|Godzilla could of been a really good movie. That is, if it didn't have  such a stupid and pointless plot, bad acting, awful direction, was more  scary and actually had a purpose. It was a poorly-done, deeply flawed,  pointless disappointment that I don't recommend.<br />I rate Godzilla 5 out of  10. The special effects were sort of effective, and it is a total shame the  whole movie wasn't as good.
B00004XPP0|3.0|I have no problem with the Special Edition but a re-release on VHS no thanks.  Why can't they bring this special edition on DVD, 'cause 15 years  ago a bought the original trilogy, 5 years ago the restored version, and  three years later the special edition, all on VHS.  So, I think I will not  buy this one, and wait...   3 stars for the Special edition and a big, big  5 stars for whole trilogy.
B00003RQNJ|2.0|I loved this movie from the first day my dad made me sit down and watch an  &quot;old movie.&quot;  What they've done to the sound quality here is an  absolute atrocity.  MONO sound???  Let's get real.  The least they could  have done is upped it to Stereo so that I wouldn't have to listen to it  through the center speaker the whole time.
B00003CX97|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time. Though it lacks action and dramatic depth it is so honeroble and heroic you can never predict what  will happen next. It is my 2nd favorite movie of all time, my favorite is  Lawrence of Arabia but they are both directed by david lean one the best  directers in the world.
0440180295|5.0|Not only is this gem of a novel a good introduction to Vonnegut, it is, as well, a great way to get back into the habit of reading again. This book is  an effortless read. The sentences fall of the page as meat from the spare  rib (when they're cooked just right). Vonnegut's genious lies in his  apparent simplicity, yet without realizing it, he invigorates your  intellect.     It is fair to dub Slaughterhouse Five an  &quot;anti-war&quot; novel, but unfair to pigeonhole-it as such.  Progressive in its structure and style, it is a refreshing journey with no  beginning and no end; fragmented and focused at the same time. Vonnegut is  a master humorist with tremendous style, not depending on boring  explanations or lofty prose but simply throwing beautiful, original, yet  simple phrases and sentences at us and relying on his acute sarcasm.     Fans of writers from Bradbury to Heller to John Irving will love  Slaughterhouse Five.
6305949638|5.0|The idea of this movie captured me long before it first hit theatre. An orphanage where hopes never die, and a boy who needs to make it in the  world before he learns his real calling in the place where he was born and  raised. It almost has a mesmerizing quality to it. Combined with the  amazing writing talent of John Irving and outstanding actors such as Toby  McGuire and Michael Caine makes this movie memorable and strong! <br />The  movie, set in a time period where many children were orphaned by the  various changes the era had to offer focuses on a small orphanage in St.  Cloud's, Maine, where abortions are not uncommon, the children grow up, and  learn the feeling of dissapointment, when a little girl with blond hair and  blue eyes is chosen by a family before a little boy with a runny nose and  charming smile, and so the competition continues with only small glimmers  of hope for each child, and some, like Fuzzy Stone, a small boy with lung  problems, never gets to have the family of his dreams. When the lead boy,  Homer (McGuire) leaves to find a new future by the ocean and earning a  living working at a small orchard with Migrant workers, he learns about  life, the kind of love he never knew he had experienced, and where he truly  belongs.<br />This story, although it is pretty far off from the book, is a  masterpiece all of it's own. Amazing acting, strong characters, and a  healthy dose of reality from that period of life makes this movie memorable  and a definite find. Check it out, and you won't be dissapointed!
0790749998|5.0|I saw all Jet li's movies that where available in my area and my conclusion is that this is  one of his best. It has funny parts and the  fighting scenes are just great! i love the scene where he uses tie wraps to  attach the enemies. I really love the concept of seeing a X-ray photography  where you can see where the ennemie got his bone, skull or chest broken or  pierced! Other movies of his that are worth checking are Twin Warriors (  Tai Chi Master), Fist of Legend, The Enforcer (My father is my hero), Black  Mask and Lethal weapon 4. People complaining about wires should watch these  movies out and they'll see how much they are used and that they actually  didn't use them much in ROMEO MUST DIE!
0446525537|3.0|After reading (and enjoying) &quot;The Notebook&quot;, and listening to &quot;Message in A Bottle&quot; on tape (seeing the movie which was, as  usual, not nearly as good as the book), I had big expectations for this  book.  I was let down.  It wasn't a waste of time to read.  I think the  charachters were developed well.  Maybe, the emotions and actions of some  are from an earlier age (1940s or 50s) or from a different place (NOT  Manhattan), but I would like to think there are still real people who feel  and act the way the charachters in &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; did.<br />I  guess my biggest dissapointment was this is an old story line and unlike  &quot;The Notebook&quot; - Sparks didn't really approach it in any  different way that hasn't been seen before.  Having just come from  &quot;Autum in New York&quot; - I can use that movie as an example.  Same  set up with characters, i.e. boy and girl who seem most incompatible - a  big age difference in &quot;Autum&quot; as opposed to the religious thing  in &quot;Walk&quot;, fall in &quot;love&quot; then face death of the girl.   But in the end the male characters do the same thing, which is very  predictable - fairy tale-ish.  What if the girl had gotten better after the  marrige and not died?  I would have liked a different approach, somewhere  in the story.<br />Thank you for evaluating my review!
080017948X|5.0|This is my favorite movie. Buy it. Too bad the DVD doesn't have any special features. It should be part of the Criterion collection. <br />Ned  (Needle Nose Ned, Ned the head) is the funniest nerd in film histoty. It  just doesn't get any better,
B000002KXV|5.0|I've been a Fagan/Dan fan since the early 70's.  If I had to live with one  CD, it would be this one.  The album has a concept, a mood and lyrics that  still stand up over these 17 years or so since its release.  He is a  perfectionist and it shows on this masterpiece.    You will not be  disappointed spending 14 bucks on this.  Be in the right mood and give it a  couple of listens.  Matter of fact, I'm pulling it out and give it a listen  again myself.  Enjoy.
B00003IPFK|5.0|Lonesome Dove is truly an epic film.  The characters are developed in such  a way that you will feel as though you know them.  Some will make you hate  them, some you will love, and others will disgust you.  It's amazing how  attached you can become to this movie, it's characters and the story line.   You will get mad, laugh, cry, and ponder.  This is one of the best movies  I've ever had the priviledge and pleasure to enjoy.
6305307261|5.0|This is a great DVD for horror and cinema fans alike to add to their collection. First of all it is packed with those great DVD extras that film  fans love: director commentary, trailers, etc. The cover art and the film  itself make this a horror classic even in this updated form. The director,  Herzog, gives an illuminating commentary of the various set pieces and his  actions and most of all what is was like working with Kinski and the  others. GREAT dream-like atmosphere is plentiful. That slow-motion bat  wonderfully creepy....Kinski's AWESOME performance (almost insect-like,  keeping with the notion that the vampire is really an obscene animal more  than a man!) and that haunting, visually amazing ending all make this one  excellent edition to your DVD horror collection. This film deserves a much  higher place in the horror-film hierarchy even though it is a remake it is  the best kind: one that pays homage to the original and has an atmosphere  and individuality all its own.  note: This film also has one of the best  musical scores that I have ever heard. It perfectly matches the surreal and  hauntingly eerie mood of the picture.
B00003CXFV|4.0|In its story, `Erin Brockovich' breaks little new ground. Essentially, it joins the ranks of earlier films such as `Silkwood,' `The Insider,' `A  Civil Action,' `The Rainmaker,' among others, each of which tells the tale  of a common `David' (be it in the form of a whistleblowing employee or  compassionate, righteous lawyer) who, against all odds, mounts a seemingly  quixotic crusade against a corporate Goliath. All the above five films  expose the shoddy and often malevolent business practices of companies that  have resulted in major health care crises for both their own employees as  well as the residents who live near the companies' facilities. In the case  of `Erin Brockovich,' the villain is the PG&amp;E electrical plant located  in the desert community of Hinckley, near Barstow, California. It seems  that the residents of this small town have been experiencing a  mind-bogglingly high number of serious illnesses and miscarriages that  PG&amp;E has assured them are not in any way related to the activities at  their site. The company has even brought in medical professionals and  toxicologists to assuage the residents' growing fears. Almost by chance,  Erin Brockovich stumbles onto this information and takes up the challenge  of fighting for the rights of these victims and exposing PG&amp;E's gross  malfeasance in the process.<br />Looking at its bare-boned plotting, one must  concede that there really isn't much that is new here. However, thanks to a  pair of utterly smashing performances by Julia Roberts and Albert Finney  and a beautifully well-rounded portrait of a real-life heroine, this Steven  Soderbergh film emerges as a true crowd-pleasing triumph. This may, in  fact, be not only Roberts' best performance, but her finest role as well.  Erin is not a conventional do-gooder heroine. First of all, she is often  abrasive and off-putting in her demeanor. Dressed more like a fashion  devotee of Roberts' `Pretty Woman' call girl character than a serious legal  executive, Erin often launches into unrestrained, obscenity-laced tirades  at her boss, her loving boyfriend, even the corporate lawyer bigwigs sent  to help her when the case she is making comes close to completion. Yet, it  is just this no-nonsense directness that earns her the confidence of the  people she is trying so desperately to help. A twice-divorced mother of  three, she is as passionate in the defense of her own children as she is in  the defense of her case. Yet, she is a woman made up of any number of  internal contradictions. Much as she loves her children, she has made a  shambles of her life in recent years. Rootless and lacking the skills  necessary to procure a well-paying job, she practically has to beg to get  hired in the office of a lawyer who has failed to win her a settlement in a  traffic accident case. Staunchly individualistic, she refuses to tone down  her rhetoric or her temper - or to adopt the more `professional' attire of  the business world - even if it might mean that she would be taken more  seriously by those around her. She assumes that no man would be willing to  consider having a serious relationship with her because of her children and  marital track record, yet, when a man enters her life doing just that, her  insecurities and her intense commitment to the cause for which she is  fighting begin to drive him away - and her children as well. Most  fascinatingly, perhaps, we are led to wonder whether it is really the  suffering people who motivate her obsessive commitment or rather, as she  herself admits, the personal recognition she receives now when she walks  into a room and people clamor desperately to know what she thinks on an  issue. All credit to Susannah Grant for writing a character so full of  believable paradoxes. Obnoxious as Erin is at times, her innate vitality,  wisdom and warm-hearted compassion consistently shine forth. Grant, by  making her such a three-dimensional figure, mitigates much of the  incredibility that lies at the root of this story, true though it may  be.<br />And, given this juicy role, Roberts is nothing short of a revelation.  She conveys each conflicting mood and character trait perfectly. Never  before has this actress brought such a breezy assurance to her every action  and statement. She literally holds this rich film together, forcing us to  focus intently on the storm of emotions taking place deep inside this  complex woman. This is definitely Oscar-caliber work. Equally brilliant is  Albert Finney as Ed Masry, the lawyer for whom Erin works, a jovial,  easygoing man who watches with a bemused appreciation as Erin hurls  colorful invective at him, rages against the system and dresses down with  withering sarcasm not only the legal representatives from PG&amp;E but the  seasoned lawyers Masry himself has hired to help bring home the case. One  of Erin's most endearing traits is that she is an equal opportunity  harridan - a fact that wins Masry over every bit as much as it does  us.<br />If `Erin Brockovich' has a weakness, it comes in the form of Erin's  romantic relationship with the unemployed motorcycle rider next door. He  seems simply too good to be true, and, although we know that it is  necessary to fill in this particular part of Erin's life to make her  portrait a well-rounded and complete one, it is still the least interesting  and believable part of the tale. We feel we are being too often distracted  from the meaty center of the story.<br />Still, this is a minor quibble about  a film that works so beautifully on so many levels. As Erin Brockovich,  Julia Roberts has finally found the role uniquely suited to her enormous  talents and she blazes forth more brightly than she has ever done before.  I, for one, will be roundly rooting for her come Oscar night.y that lies at the root of this story, true though it may  be.<br />And, given this juicy role, Roberts is nothing short of a revelation.

B00004R99J|2.0|This poking, plodding snoozer barely rates two stars.  The songs are  dreary and poorly rendered, and the plot is almost nonexistent.  Everybody  in America knows the Pocahontas legend and can state it in a paragraph;  Disney fluffs it into 80 minutes of wooden characters and lousy songs.   This movie has none of the zip of Alladin or Hercules, and none of the  charm of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast.  Unless you want to  collect all the Disney animated shows, take a pass on this one and spend  your money on Tarzan instead.
6305810109|4.0|I saw the preview for this movie and thought: &quot;Wow. That looks good. I'll rent it when it comes out.&quot;<br />When I did rent it, the  twentysomething cashier at the counter was like: 'are you sure you wanna  rent it?' as though a movie solely about an old man was too lame to watch.  I didn't let him deter me though.<br />I liked the movie. But not that much. I  don't understand why everyone loved it. It had a nice message, good acting,  and beautiful cinematography, but still . . . it didn't exactly grab me and  pull me in.<br />Definitely four stars, but definitely not five.

B000005HBI|4.0|Cassandra Wilson has a great voice, and her arrangements of &quot;Black  Crow&quot; and &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; are really nice. But overall, the  arrangements and production on this album are too similar for my taste. I  have a hard time listening to the album from beginning to end because it  really doesn't change too much. In short doses, however, there is some  great material here.
B000023VR6|5.0|Dr. Dre came out with The Chronic in 1992, and since then has been  producing great albums from Snoop to Eminem.  With this cd he blew  everything he has done out the water.  Since his last solo effort, Dre has  grown up but has not forgot to find a bangin beat for every song on the cd.   First off any album that includes Snoop, Kurupt, Eminem and Nate Dogg  needs no introduction, the fact that Dre finds the perfect beats to fit  these perfomers is astounding.  Dre stil brings the same ryhmes but it is  the way the beats make you feel that makes this the best rap cd in a long  time.  All I got to say is look out for Hitman, whose talents of Explosive  and Ackright are bound to spring him for a solo career backed up by Dre.   There is rarely a rap cd that can be listened to from the first intro to  the last song, but thats what I've done since I got it.  Very few weakneses  in this album, except the fact that it doesn't have a 30 tracks instead of  22.  Still D.R.E wil be remembered as Dre's newest classic within a few  years.  I wouldn't we surprised to hear this cd make waves through the year  2001 even though it came out in November 1999.  Don't come out for this cd  to be the g-funk Dre once made famous... expect it to be what Dre will make  famous next.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I saw this movie the first day of the showing and it was great! The plot is typical of all horror flicks, the picking off one by one of the crew,  but it is done in a manner to keep you guessing what will happen next and  who will be left. The movie did not have the typical ending where the  audience already figured out the plot and how the movie would end. This  flick does keep you envolved and intrigued from beginning to end. Not a  yawn to be found. I can't wait for the DVD!
B000002KYB|5.0|Just the usual excellent music from Dire Straits, like one reviewer said  &quot;timeless music&quot;. In that sense Mark Knopfler stands as a kind of  modern version of a Mozart or thereabouts even though the music is so far  apart in style. His lyrics and extremely cool rendering of the songs which  epitomize modern rock even define it to some extent. Who can say they've  never heard of Dire Straits as long as you're not 15 or younger. Through  the 70's and 80's they strode the world as the best band. I saw them in  Hobart, Tasmania (Australia), the air was full of pot and the beam of light  hit the lone guitar player as he started off &quot;Walk of Life&quot;, just  incredible. You don't get any better than these guys.
6304510861|3.0|In Lost Highway, David Lynch returns to some of the things that worked so well for him in Blue Velvet in 1986. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a very good script here, and to make up for that he tries too hard to be mysterious and arty. The first part of the film plays like an experimental low budget amateur venture (although the acting is professional). The sets are too dark and the games with the lighting lead to nothing. The long takes on the faces of the actors add nothing, and the long time spent fading to black creates nothing more than a mood of impatience. The supernatural hooey is strictly grade \\"B.\\" The barroom lighting in most of the interiors recalls the apartment in Blue Velvet, but the apartment in Blue Velvet worked well because of its lay out and how it was set up to work effectively in the plot of the movie. Here we just have a lot of barroom lighting with little purpose.<br />Robert Blake, with his white clown face makeup as the \\"mystery man,\\" expands on the cameo character of Dean Stockwell in Blue Velvet, but he is not so interesting as we eventually see he is another tired personification of some kind of Lucifer. Patricia Arquette plays the female sex animal as Isabella Rossellini did in Blue Velvet and she is as sexy as sexy can be, but not as interesting as Rossellini because she is a little too perfect physically, and too psychologically familiar. Lynch's idea that women are evil temptresses leading men astray is worked on here, but yields nothing new.<br />Main problem besides the script is Lynch has no Dennis Hopper. And he has no contrast. Laura Dern in Blue Velvet was a perfect foil to Rossellini, really etching their contrasting characters for us, but against Arquette plays only a variation of herself. Bill Pullman is good in a grim, spiritless role. Balthazar Getty, with more to do, does it very well.<br />The movie is also very poorly edited. A lot of the first half hour could have been profitably tossed. The film only gets going after the prison scene. (The \\"road rage\\" scene in the Hollywood Hills was good.) The desert scene where Arquette seems to turn into Blake was a wonderful opportunity lost. Instead of sex by the headlights of the Mustang in front of a dreary wooden structure (I don't think the crew got farther than Victorville) how about sex among the cacti in the blazing sun in front of something adobe? And the Lost Highway Hotel? Gee, how did everybody end up there apropos nothing and without rhyme or reason? How convenient for the requisite gore to follow.the prison scene.

6305657947|5.0|I love this movie, it is my favorite dvd.  I think that this movie has  great visuals and a great soundtrack.  The concept and story is also  killer.  The replay value of this movie is almost the highest of my whole  collection!
157330087X|2.0|With the possible exception of Buddy Guy, SRV played with more intensity than any of these guys. In his interview Clapton says that, after he heard  SRV he (Clapton) was embarrassed to go on stage. And rightly so. Buddy Guy  &amp; Bonnie Raitt are terrific; B.B. King is B.B. King. Robert Cray  continues to underwhelm and Jimmy Vaughan does his best. Eric continues to  be a crowd pleaser but how far he has fallen from All Your Lovin' or Layla  or White Room or Crossroads or....
B00003CWN2|5.0|This very powerful movie is based on the true story of Teena Brandon,<br />a troubled young person who saw herself as a boy.  At the age of 21,<br />she cut her hair, does what she can to change her identity and moves<br />from Lincoln Nebraska to another small town 70 miles away.<br />It's<br />Brandon, not Teena, who the audience sees, as he struggles with his<br />identity in an area of the country where alcohol is the liquid of<br />choice, dead-end factory jobs are the rule, and a violent machismo<br />sub-culture dominates the landscape.<br />It is here that Brandon falls<br />in love, finds happiness for a very short while, and is then raped and<br />murdered.<br />Directed by Kimberly Peirce, Brandon is brilliantly played<br />by Hilary Swank. It is obviously an extremely difficult and demanding<br />role and she has been nominated for an academy award, along with the<br />Chloe Sevigny who plays the young lady who falls in love with<br />Brandon.<br />This is the kind of film that is brutal in its intensity,<br />not just in the scenes of violence, but also in the depiction of<br />relationships between the characters and the stark and sad world they<br />live in.  It is also an example of filmmaking at its best, from the<br />casting to the close-ups of the subtleties of young love.  In<br />addition, it makes a social statement as to the price that Teena<br />Brandon had to pay for being different.<br />Excellent.  And a movie I<br />will long remember.
B00004THAY|4.0|Like many others, I was skeptical when this was first released.  B.B. is  the undisputed King of the Blues, and I wondered how well he and Eric  Clapton would mesh.  But then, I heard &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot;  on the radio, and I was hooked (some times, I think it is impossible for  someone to do a bad job with this song).<br />The title, &quot;Riding With the  King&quot; kinda lets us know who is the Boss here.  Clapton and B.B. both  did themselves proud with this album, though.  There is more than enough to  make this a worthwhile purchase.  The instrumental work between them is the  best, and their two distinctive styles mesh well together.   However, Slow  Hands cannot hang when it comes to the vocal aspect of the Blues, and is a  tad short in some blues classics.  <br />They positively burn down the house  with their rendition of the Isaac Hayes/David Porter classic &quot;Hold On,  I'm Coming&quot;.  That alone makes this worth the price of a ticket to  ride.   This is a fine fine disc.

B00003CXDV|5.0|My kids (5 and 9) and I watch this movie over and over.  As an old Star Trek/sci fi fan, I find it a crack up.  But you don't have to be a Trekker  to find the movie funny - its a hoot. And the plot and acting are terrific.   I never expected the movie to be so good.  Any one who likes sci fi or  just a good adventure film will LOVE this movie.<br />The violence (weapons  are used, a few somewhat scary aliens, and there is one death) is on the  level of the original Star Trek, not excessive and in context of the  plot/growth of a major character - most 5-6 year olds would handle it  easily (definitely less offensive than most Saturday morning TV shows).
0307155102|5.0|This is the best book for pre-readers.   Great drawings and characters that little ones love, such as Lowly Worm and  Kenny and Kathy Bear.    Between my two daughters (now 13 and 8), we have read  this book so many  times when they were little,that we have  worn out three copies.    I have  bought two other copies to put away for when they   have their own little  ones.   I only wish I would have written Richard Scarry a thanks  before he  passed away.
1884822312|5.0|Although this book hardly gives any text except for a few introductions, this book can teach chess very well.  The book is full of diagrams on one,  two and three move mates.  It also gives miniature games which show how to  play the openings and the middle game, especially on how to attack the  king.  There is an excellent section on engame technique as well.  Also  included are some games of the polgars illustrating various principles of  chess.  The beauty of the book lies in two aspects.  First of all, by  constant repitition in solving the diagrams one is on his way to pattern  recognition, which is essential to chess mastery.  This means that one can  see mating positions and various weaknesses in a position far ahead in the  game.  Secondly, the diagrams if closely studied show chess strategies and  tactics that can be applied to other positions as well.  For instance, in  one diagram some moves were made, forcing the opposition to block his own  pieces.  This can also be used in the openings and other positions that may  arise.  Probably the lack of text in the book, makes the student WORK  harder to find similar tactics in other positions.  The book is somewhat  expensive, but worth it.

I especially love  the songs &quot;Brave STrangers&quot; and &quot;The Famous Final  Scene.&quot; This is definately an album you can not sit and listen to  passively. Its energy pulls you in and keeps you there until the very end.  I have worn out one cassette and on my way to wearing out the other.

B00003CX95|4.0|The story of William Wallace and his struggle to free Scotland is beautifully brought to the screen by Mr. Gibson and his excellent cast.   Although not personally familiar with the history behind the man, I  understand that Mr. Gibson took liberties with facts, but it is commonly  understood that Hollywood will sacrifice accuracy for entertainment.<br />The  plot is simple: Scotland is under the yoke of Britain and its evil ruler.   Wallace, brought brought up outside Scotland, returns upon reaching manhood  to his village and his people where he falls in love.  Although trying to  live in peace, the English oppression on his people prove to be too much,  and he takes up arms against the powerful enemy to the south.<br />There are,  of course, the requesite battle scenes, despicable actions by the king to  show how truly evil he is, as well as the double-crossing and the romance.   However, the scope and scale of the movie is truly breath-taking.  The  battles are long, arduous affairs, with decapitations, mutilations and lots  of blood.  Think &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; meets people with really  big axes.  But the battles are not merely graphic; they are beautifully  choreographed, and extremely well shot.  The spectator can follow the  action and understand the tactics involved.<br />Ms. Marceau brings fire and  strength to the role of the English King's daughter-in-law.  She is  introduced as a pawn of the King, but she reveals to much more than  that.<br />My complaint of the movie is that the pacing is a bit off.  Three  quarters into the movie, it reaches a point where I thought the movie was  over.  All of a sudden, the plot resumes.  The ending is also a bit too  dramatic, but then again, we are dealing with larger-than-life  characters.<br />Overall, this is a highly recommendable movie, and definitely  a must-see for all Mel Gibson fans.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|In the art of film making there are always some pieces that capture ones interest, but very few are able to capture ones imagination and send it on  a wild ride of adventure and fantasy like the Star Wars trilogy has, over  the last 23 years.<br />Now we can enjoy it all over again as if it were the  very first time in this new Widescreen version of the saga, that promises  to send you through hyperspace into the farthest reaches of outerspace  right from your living room, giving you the feeling of the real movie  theater, but of course, without all those things at the movies we can  certainly do without.<br />It also packs a special bonus to all Star Wars  fans, old as well as new.  That's a special preview on the next film, Star  Wars Episode II, that also promises a bundle for all to enjoy.<br />It comes  with all that good stuff we have come to expect in the ways of the Force  and much, much more from the galaxy far, far away that we all have come to  love.<br />I don't know about you, but I hope you get yourself a copy of this  magnificent piece of movie magic right away, I know I will, and soon.
6303942830|4.0|Easily one of the best American films of the Nineties.  A moving tale of love, war, revenge, and redemption.  Wonderfully shot on location with  rousing battle scenes. I found the battle scenes to be more interesting  than those in, say, Braveheart. This intelligent film has fine pacing and  is graced with a very interesting music score. Wes Studi gives an excellent  portrayal as the sulking, vengeful Magua. This film was directed by Michael  Mann who also directed The Insider and Heat (as well as Miami Vice). If you  want an action film with intelligence, The Last of the Mohicans is it.
B000031WD9|4.0|I hope you have seen the movie so I will just speak about the extra things  on the dvd.  There is a great commentary by the director and some of the  actors, it makes the move even more hilarious!  I also loved the  blooper/outakes.
B00003CWTH|1.0|This is such a director-wishes-he-was-Robert-Altman film (with an utterly meaningless title), it's laughable. Following the pitiful, self-pitying  characters through their tragic lives is dull, annoying and tiresome. Tom  Cruise's terrible performance is totally embarrassing, almost as  embarrassing as his haircut. But that's fine because he's such an overrated  &quot;actor&quot; anyway. How so many good actors (Julianne Moore, William  H. Macy, Jason Robards, Michael Murphy, Melora Walters, Melinda Dillon)  ended up in this miserable film is beyond me...especially considering that  many of them (Moore, Macy, Murphy, and Henry Gibson) have all been in  Altman films, which are WORLDS better than this horrid bore-fest. The frog  scene was just ridiculous, and the sequence where all of the main  characters are singing along to one of the dull Aimee Mann songs was so  trite I laughed out loud. What a dumb gimmick to try and relate the dismal  lives of these characters, most of whom are living in self-created misery.  Boo hoo. How is an audience supposed to feel sorry for people that have put  themselves into such grim, pathetic situations? I just couldn't care less.  Save 3 hours of your life and watch a *truly* brilliant ensemble film:  Altman's &quot;Nashville&quot;.
B00003CWNR|4.0|The title of the movie has spelled out the theme, though it takes you some time to know what it means at the very beginning.<br />Overall speaking, it is  a very balanced movie that can attract your attention to the end. The theme  was dealt with through the dialogues of different characters inside it -  why should someone set down rules for things which they don't really  involved in? The theme was brought up by the abortion controversy and the  cider house rules.<br />Nonetheless, there are some side lines which worth  further thoughts. One of them is the &quot;affair&quot; between Toby and  Charlize, who claimed that she was not good in being alone. Was there real  love between them? Or is Toby just a means for her to satisfy her physical  and emotional desires? That was not really tackled. Charlize returned to  her original boy friend to take care of him, but is this out of love or  duties? In fact, was the affair between her and Toby really necessary? I  tend to take the orientation that, this part of the movie has in fact  spoiled the plot of the movie instead of coloring it. This movie can still  live without emotional love for it still has peer love, love between a  teacher and a student, care among colleagues, friendship etc. Why bother  adding this part to it?<br />The other one was the incest relation of the  cider house rule manager and her daughter. It did provide a dramatic effect  to the whole story and of course it paved way for Toby to return to the  orphanage to succeed Michael's role as the doctor and manager. However, at  the same time, it made the atmosphere of the story very heavy, and  sometimes too heavy for the audience.<br />Michael's view on abortion is  disputable, but worth some deeper thoughts. However I personally do not  agree his doings of faking qualifications, despite it was for good. Also  the management of life and death, the King Kong movie show, the nurses at  the orphanage etc. all added up some good elements to the  movie.<br />Nontheless, the superb performance of each of the roles in the  movie did really help to make the movie a real good one. You can feel their  feelings and draw yourself in the story as if you were among them watching  and participating in what was happening. Of course, needless to say, the  perfect match of the soundtrack has given the movie a pair of wings to take  flight.r />Nontheless, the superb performance of each of the roles in the  movie did really help to make the movie a real good one.

B000002BUY|5.0|First off, anyone who calls an Incubus song on MTV &quot;so sweet&quot;  (not sweet as in cool, I'm talking teenage girl language now) does not  understand where the band is coming from. Incubus are an amazingly talented  band out of Calabassas, California, who play funk metal with hip hop. Their  long, almost progressive melodies are too far reaching for your young minds  to understand. To you, it's just music, but for the more intelligent of us,  it's highly skilled musicians playing music better than anything on MTV  right now. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is way more thrashy than Make Yourself, and to  me, has more meaning. Make Yourself is a great album, but this is better.  DJ Lyfe was an excellent DJ, especially here, adding even more funk to the  band. Mike Einziger is one of the best guitarists today, mixing stuff from  bands like Rush and the Police with bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers and  coming out with something original. Jose is an excellent drummer, despite  not having a ton of experience, using punk drumming with hardcore funk  music. Brandon is wonderful when it comes to djembes and great singing,  adding new vibes to the already trippy music. Alex/Dirk's bass lines are  drum n' bassy with loads of funk, but you can actually hear them as in Rage  Against the Machine or Primus' music. Suggested tracks: Redefine, Vitamin,  New Skin, Favorite Things, Hidden Track, Calgone, Glass. Suggested bands:  Primus, Faith No More, Thrak-Era King Diamond, 311, Floored/Lemonade and  Brownies-Era Sugar Ray. Suggested CDs: 311- 311, Sugar Ray- Floored. Highly  recommended.
B00003CWLE|5.0|When I got this I really wasn't expecting much. I have seen the King and I so many times I thought Anna and the King would be just like that without  music. Let me tell you it is so much better. Chow Yun-Fat's preformace is  really outstanding and Jodie Foster is great. What really makes the movie  is the chemisty between them. It is just such a romantic movie. The  cinamotography was really exceptional as well. This movie is well worth the  money.
0380713802|1.0|I did not find this book funny. I DID find it mean-spirited, intolerant, and whiny. And let me state for the record that I have backpacked through  many of the countries Mr Bryson visited.<br />I have only the following to say  to him:<br />- The idea of traveling is to be able to experience and  encounter new cultures societies and accept them for what they are, not to  criticise, criticise, and then criticise some more. So the Germans and  Swiss have an inordinate number of rules, and the French cut queues.   Nobody asked you to visit, and if you don't like it you can always go  home.<br />- Not everyone speaks English.<br />- The Second World War  ended 55 years ago (or 45 years at the time he wrote the book). It is not  nice to keep harping on it, when those responsible for it have expressed  their contrition and been punished. (If he has a problem with the Second  War, go pick on the Japanese, who seem able only to whine about 2 nuclear  bombs being dropped on them and have conveniently forgotten the countless  atrocities they committed in Asia.)<br />- Industrial development is an  inevitable part of progress. It cannot always be done in a pretty manner,  and even if it could, that might cost money which the country can  ill-afford to spend. So too bad if you find that your sense of aesthetics  offended; the decisions of governments are not made with only you in  mind.<br />- It's perverted to want a place to have more dangerous,  reckless drivers just to fit your image of what that country should be  like.<br />- Things change in 18 years. Doubtless you were a lot more  tolerant when you were 20. It's sad to devote a holiday to revisiting the  places you went to long ago and, instead of reveling in the familiar amidst  the different, spend it tut-tutting about how different it was 18 years  ago. Quit dwelling in the past!<br />- It would be nice if you could be  happy about more tourist dollars enriching the local economy instead of  whingeing about the inconvenience additional tourists pose to YOUR personal  comfort.<br />- You complain about hordes of American/Japanese/German  tourists spoiling everything, and bemoan the prospect of more tourists on  group tours clogging up Europe. That's not the problem, the problem is all  the whingeing that emits from these tourists, and unfortunately, in terms  of attitude, you are indistinguishable from them.<br />- A holiday goes a  lot easier if you PLAN and BOOK in advance. Then you won't have to spend so  much time queueing for tickets only to be told they were sold out ages ago.  Then you won't have to complain so much.<br />- On the last page, you  state a desire to forge on ahead and see Asia. PLEASE DON'T COME HERE. You  can't even survive Europe without complaining about the crowds and the  litter and the service and the people. What makes you think you can survive  here? And we can do without the worst kind of tourist of all - a cross  between the American whinger and the intolerant Englishwoman he complains  infests Italy.
B00001OH7P|4.0|This is a strange album. I got it on CD, with about four bonus tracks. The  one above you is not that CD, but I think I saw it on the way here...  <br />Anyway, the album's quality is at its peak (in my opinion) with numbers  1,2,3,4, and 11. The others are good as well, but those five are really my  favorites. They're melancholy, but they're telling the story of Ziggy  Stardust in a really subtle manner. Good! Still, I deducted a star because,  it's, well, it's a pretty pretentious album. Most progressive rock stars  were for some reason. That's okay, though, because the music matches up.
0833509454|5.0|I rented the movie from a local movie rental store and it was the best movie I had ever seen (and that's saying a WHOLE LOT!). But, the movie  pales in comparison with the book. There's so much more detail and  background information about the people and the town (Derry, Maine) in the  book. I feel like I am close friends with The Lucky 7. Bill Denbrough  (stuttered terribly when he was a kid and is a horror novelist in  adulthood), Eddie Kaspbrak (had &quot;asthma&quot; when he was a kid and  co- owns a limousine company in adulthood), Ben Hanscom (was fat when he  was a kid and is an award winning architect in adulthood), Beverly Marsh  (was abused by her father when she was a kid and co- owns a designer  company in adulthood), Richie Tozier (loved to do funny voices when he was  a kid and is a comedian/impressionist in adulthood), Stan Uris (a Jew who  was a boy scout when he was a kid and an accountant in adulthood), and Mike  Hanlon (a black man who was an expert on Derry's history as a kid and the  Derry Librarian as an adult). It also allows you to know a great deal about  the bullies of their childhood: Victor Criss, Belch Huggins, and their  leader, Henry Bowers (Commited to an insane asylum in adulthood). The Lucky  7 encounter an evil when they are children that takes the form of Bob Gray  (better known as Pennywise The Dancin' Clown). They battle IT but they  don't get the job done. IT returns 30 years later and Mike (the only one of  The Lucky 7 who was still in Derry) called the other 6 and asked them to  hold true to a promise (to come back if IT ever returned) that they made  when they were kids. To come back and face IT one last time. I commend  Stephen King and the job that he did on this novel. I HIGHLY recommend this  book. ENJOY!
B00001NFCY|4.0|Today the Christian Rock genre is...well..sort of weak in my opinion.   This album is a great way to get the Christian message into the mainstream  of American culture.  The songs are cool too.  The only complaint is that  some of the songs sound a little bit too similar.  All in all, its a very  good cd.
B000002J0G|5.0|Sorry to all those who don't appreciate this CD but you simply do not have  a clue. Yes, I've been a fan since the first album and with the exception  of The Ritual, I'm proud to say my tastes have expanded exactly along the  same lines. While I'm not too huge on the 100% death vocals on Demonic,  Testament got even better on the Gathering. Chuck mixes his voice up  perfectly and shows what Metallica should be playing nowadays-technically  and melodically superior in every possible way. The fact that this band is  not very popular anymore says alot about modern metal fans tastes. Nirvana  and that whole grunge scene seemed to destroy an appreciation for talent  that even today is having a hard time making it's prescence known
0140186409|5.0|Steinbeck's chilling masterpiece about the American dream gone bad still resonates loudly and hauntingy today as it did sixty years ago.  Police  brutality, racism, and unfair labor practices still manage to take center  stage and thwart the idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness  being entitled to everyone.<br />The superhuman strength and will of Ma Joad  will rudely wake you up from your slumber and inspire you to go out and  make a difference.  Steinbeck eloquently takes you on a lengthy journey of  faith, hope, and despair that, at times, requires patience, but that  patience will be rewarded a hundred times over.<br />Through Ma Joad,  Steinbeck hints that the world is a better place to live in and more  conquerable if people saw outside their own families and became one big  extended family.  A practice that is sorely needed today as technology  increasingly diminishes the human element.<br />STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T  WANT TO KNOW ENDING.<br />In the greatest ending of a novel in American  literature history, Rose of Sharon, who just delivered a stillborn child,  offers her full breast to a hungry stranger in a barn.  Steinbeck paints  this beautiful picture of the ultimate act of human kindness with an  amazing combination of power and poetry.  This brilliant ending clinches  &quot;Grapes&quot; as one of the greatest American novels ever.
B00003CXFV|4.0|Is this, as some have stated, a NORMA RAE for the 90's, uh, 2000's (well, it takes place in the 90's)? Well, yes it is. Hollywood likes to turn out  these &quot;little-man (or more recently, woman) against the system&quot;  spectacles, and they can be counted on to have many in the audience  cheering on the quixotic main characters in their fights against a.  corporate polluters b. union busters c. corrupt politicians d. the powers  that be in any of their permuations.<br />So in that regard, ERIN BROCKOVICH  is not especially original. It is, however, effective--as good an example  of the genre as any you're likely to find.  As a tough-but-sensitive broad  with a heart of gold, Julia Roberts turns in another winning performance.   She cements her much vaunted &quot;comeback&quot; with a somewhat more  serious role than she usually gets and may well walk off with an Oscar for  her efforts. (Think of MASK-era Cher with a social cause.) And the rest of  the cast is very good indeed.  Much attention has been paid to Albert  Finney, who is very good as Erin's irascible boss.  More attention should  have been given to Aaron Eckhart, Marg Helgenberger and the all too briefly  seen Cherry Jones.  <br />Following on the heels of THE LIMEY and OUT OF  SIGHT, the film represents another step forward on director Steven  Soderbergh's comeback trail as well.  It is, of course, a much less daring  film than Soderbergh is capable of.  But he is entitled to enjoy the  success (both artistic and commercial) achieved here. So it's a tad  formulaic, EB is solid work all around.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I had never really liked Metallica before I was introduced into Napster.   Now, I own several of their cds and can testify that this collection is a  great one.  Metallica's &quot;greatest hits&quot; are well represented on  this cd and I feel that the Band/Orchestra collaboration is one that is  original and enjoyable. A very good cd indeed.
B000002U82|5.0|Back in 1973 (when Dark Side was released), coming up with an album with  many &quot;special effects&quot; wasn't easy.  In fact, I heard it took as  many as 8 months to perfect the sound on this album.  Roger Waters had  written a story around a whole record.  When you read the lyrics of  &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;, these songs are closer to everyday  life than you think.  Some of the dialouge you hear was taken from  interviews Roger had conducted as part of the album's experiment.  <br />This  was the 1st Pink Floyd album where all the songs ran together, like a long  medley (of course, the Beatles and the Moody Blues had made this technique  popular prior to this).  This was one of the 1st albums where the special  effects were a vital part of virtually each song: take for instance the  heartbeat and the dialouge during &quot;Speak to Me&quot; (&quot;I've  always been mad&quot;), the running and various effects for &quot;On the  Run&quot;, the alarm clock at the beginning of &quot;Time&quot;, the  dialouge &quot;I am not afraid to die...&quot; on &quot;The Great Gig In  the Sky&quot;, the cash register and the voice that says &quot;Yes,  asbolutely!  I certainly was in the right!&quot; for &quot;Money&quot;, the  echo on &quot;Us and Them&quot;, the laughing lunatic for &quot;Brain  Damage&quot;, and the speech &quot;There is no dark side of the moon  really, as a matter of fact, it's all dark!&quot;.  Both &quot;Time&quot;  and &quot;Money&quot; became big hits.  <br />David Gilmour's guitar and  vocals are great, especially on the blues shuffle &quot;Money&quot;.   Richard Wright was able to capture the right moods musically, particularly  on &quot;Any Color You Like&quot;, the melancholy &quot;Us and Them&quot;,  and the gospel-flavored &quot;The Great Gig In the Sky&quot;.  In addition  to playing drums, Nick Mason's voice can be heard in the dialogue (I  believe it's his laugh you hear on &quot;Brain Damage&quot;).  And of  course, Roger Waterswrote the lyrics, sang half the songs, and played  bass.  As a result, of all this work came 1 of the best selling rock albums  of the 1970's.  If you haven't heard this in its entirety, you're in for a  big surprise!
B00004XPP0|4.0|This is the Special Edition version, not the Original classics as we saw 20 years ago.  I have mixed views towards the Special Editions.  I like  some stuff, like the pan galactic celebration in Jedi, and getting to see  more of cloud city in Empire.  But I thought Jabba looked too CGI, and  Greedo does NOT fire first, period.  The films were just fine.  Did we  really need this? Anyway, I wish they'd put out the Originals, I've heard  that Mr. Lucas is destroying all the original prints of the trilogy so that  the only version left is the Special Edition.  Perhaps we'll see it on DVD  someday?
B000001IQH|5.0|Without a doubt the best punk album since Nevermind The Bollocks. Rancid has been accused by critics of selling out , and not staying true to punk  by adding reggae , and dub sounds . But critics don't buy cd's the fan's  do. This is one of the greatest punk albums you are ever going to find.  With Tim Armstrong's deeply personal lyrics (&quot;Daly City Train&quot; ,  &quot;As Wicked&quot; ) , and the anthem &quot;Roots Radicals&quot; , and  the classics &quot;Ruby Soho&quot; , &quot;Time Bomb&quot; , &quot;11th  Hour&quot; , and so many more , you have just got to own this album even if  you don't like punk , this should go down as one of the greatest albums of  all time.
1573226521|5.0|After having read some of the other reviews I don't have much more to add.  I read The Beach this summer on my holiday in France - it was supposed to  be a family-holiday but I just could not put my book down. Alex Garland is  such a talented author - the way he sees people and describes their  relationships with eachother. I was surprised in a positive way! You should  definitely buy the book - and read it over and over again! But take this  advise along with you: Do NOT go and see the film - huge disappointment!  Oh, and you should read The Tesseract by Garland as well - this book is  more mature and different than The Beach in many ways - but it is fabulous  as well.
B00004U8H4|1.0|I love horror/terror/suspense -- all those movies.  I waited with anticipation to see this movie... I wanted, I really really wanted to like  it, and it just sucked.  Many reviewers comments are ambiguous because they  can't think of much good to say, but feel they have to.  The movie was  moronic.  All that 80's humor, WOW!  And another Kaiser Sose type ending.   GEE!  zzzzzzzzzzzz....
B00004SZBC|5.0|I consider this album to be one of the most important turning points in  the Pet Shop Boys career.  Before this one came out, they had been focusing  strictly on electronic music, basic &quot;hit music&quot; style recordings  (although the album Actually is a piece of artwork on it's own).  But when  this one was made, they began to do, what now we have come to accept from  them.  Yet it was looked at as experimental by us, and most likely by them;  it was a combination of electronic music now mixed with an orchestra.  Example is the first song on the track, &quot;Left to my Own Devices&quot;.  I remember listening to this song over and over again.  Incredible  combination of orchestrations and electronic music with Neil's voice gently  talking, and a woman singing in the background.  I personally enjoy the  version on this album, the ORIGNIAL version better, than the single release  of this song.  It always seems to me that the versions of the song that  were put on the actual album are better than the quick renditions for the  radio.  And that can be said of every song on this album.  This cd contains  alot of hit songs that Pet Shop Boys are known for including &quot;Domino  Dancing&quot;, &quot;Always on my Mind&quot; and &quot;It's alright&quot;.  All of these pieces are different from the next, as can be said with every  one of their albums, yet Introspective seemed to be them finally finding  themselves, and liking the groove that they finally have settled into.  Making it more enjoyable for us, that's for sure.  Because this album is so  good, that I couldn't see a Pet Shop Boy fan who doesn't have it.  It  certainly is worth any price.  Even if just for the originality, alone.
0553108034|2.0|I awaited this book with great eagerness after reading the first book. While a first book in a fantasy series has more objectives to accomplish  (characters, politics, nations, etc.), it must also realize the normal  objectives of a plot: suspense, climax, and tying up of at least some loose  ends. A Game of Thrones does all this. Sadly, A Clash of Kings does not.  The best hope for readers of this series is to read some kind of synopsis  of what happens and go on from there. I felt, as a reader, that the end of  the first book left me with an appropriate amount of suspence (and enough  climaxes), being that I was involved with the characters and their goals.  The second book simply felt mired in the details of the characters' goals,  without ever getting anywhere. At the end of this book, I felt like I  didn't care what would happen next because it seemed like I had read 700+  pages of nothing very important since the last book and I was very  frustrated. Again, a short summary of this book in the third book's jacket  would do nicely in place of all these pages.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Read the reviews from &quot;Remo&quot; and &quot;Crispy&quot; and pay attention!  This is a great, great CD - may take some 4,5, or more listens,  but, be patient. Very innovative, very diverse, and it rocks! I am an  old-timer (50) and have a 13-yr old as well and its our favorite CD out  there right now. Don't listen to the few music &quot;snobs&quot; that  reviewed it &amp; dogged it out. It's not like the first QOTSA album (which  I also have) - it's better!  I have some friends that hated it upon first  couple of listens, but after begging them to hear again, they finally  agreed. Get it!
0790738074|5.0|The Music Man is a great story (If you are a girl  mostly! ) but it has some great songs like the (most famous one) 76 trombones, Shipoopi,&amp;  Marian. It is a story about a con man (Robert Preston) comes to   River  City Iowa  and pretends he is a music man.And only Marian ( shirly  Jones)Knows about him! I am sure that most of you will enjoy this movie As  much as I did!
B000002H2H|5.0|a lot of people think that the self-titled &quot;metallica&quot; album was the purest example of metallica's music.  while it's an awesome album, i  think &quot;ride the lightning&quot; is what metallica is all about.  the  very best thrash/speed metal you will ever hear, in my opinion.  a lot of  songs are in the style of &quot;kill 'em all,&quot; but the album has a  much more mature sound to it.  complete with a ballad (about suicide, of  course), biblical references and a song based on a work by h.p. lovecraft,  i think this album has it all.  now, if you don't like hearing songs about  death, steer clear of this album.  but if you call yourself a metallica  fan, this is a must-have!
1563890410|5.0|I haven't read all 10 books yet, only through 5, but this is probably my favorite so far.  Just because of the prologue.  The art in the prologue is  fantastic and the intense featuring of the endless all togethor (except for  whathisface...) and there's death.  I love death.  Best character in the  series and she's drawn perfectly here.  Oh and the rest of the story is  great (except that horrid picture of death halfway through where she looks  like a fat middle aged woman dieing of a drug overdose (it's that ugly)).   I love the whole death leaving hell idea.  Gaiman has already prooven  himself a master of character development in a short time.  I really cared  for all the characters introduced in this book.  Even the mythological  characters were really cool.  I wholeheartedly reccomend this novel!  Go  order it now!
0782008364|4.0|In &quot;Bound&quot;, I'm sure that you're already well-aware that Gina Gershon and Jennifer Tilly play two lesbians (Gina being 'the butch' and  Jen playing 'the femme') trying to steal two-million dollars from the mob.  It's an edge-of-your-seat thriller where you're wanting them to be together  and to get away with the two-mill.<br />The DVD edition has cool commentary  with the directors, an extra, and the three main stars. Suffice to say, it  is a little boring until Jennifer arrives and livens things up. She's  really a funny woman. And then Gina arrives with about thirty minutes left.  But you can tell just by listening to them that they had a chemistry among  them, which helped make this movie work.<br />You also get the trailer, and  scene selection. The only reason I'm giving this movie four stars is  because I think the mob guys in the movie do tend to grate on one's nerves  after awhile. I mean, Gina Gershon is in the movie...could it have hurt to  have her in it more? *LOL* Oh well...it's a very cool movie, and the DVD  experience only makes it more worth your money!
0385493622|5.0|Pierre De Fermat was in my opinion the greatest mathematician of all time  except possibly for Pythagoras.  We are still discovering astonishing  things about him.  He lived in the 1600s, mostly before Newton (with a  slight overlap), but he invented/discovered large parts of the calculus  before Newton.  He invented analytic geometric before Descartes (Descartes  was so furious at his secretiveness that he spent much of his life trying  to ruin Fermat's career as a government lawyer/official in France).  With  Pascal, he invented probability theory.  He invented modern number theory,  which is key to cryptography among other things.  The search for the proof  of Fermat's Last Theorem resulted in the founding of several major branches  of advanced algebra and number theory.  He discovered major results in  physics including optics before Newton and in fact in my opinion may have  anticipated parts of Einstein's special theory of relativity because of his  interest in optics (where he correctly found that light slows down in  water, contrary to Descartes' findings) and the similarity of the  quadratic(square) expression in Fermat's Last Theorem to the vital beta or  1/beta factor in the Lorentz contraction of special relativity.  Fermat was  roughly 300-350 years ahead of his time, and the only scientist who was  more ahead of him appears to have Leonardo Da Vinci of the Renaissance who  may have been 400 or so years ahead of his time.  Even Einstein was only a  few years ahead of his time because the mathematics apparatus was already  in place when Einstein reinterpreted it from a physics viewpoint.   McInerny's review is very good, but don't be surprised if somebody  discovers a much shorter proof than Wiles' based on the reinterpretation of  the word &quot;margin&quot; to mean difference in variables/numbers.  Go  out and buy this book.
B00000IREA|5.0|Well, I finally did it! I got &quot;Barbarella&quot; on DVD! And wow...what can I say? I definitely should not have waited. The picture  quality is amazing and sooo much better than the video I had. I was amazed  at the clarity of it, it was almost like watching a different movie (but,  come on now, can &quot;Barbarella&quot; really be mistaken for anything  else?).<br />You also get the classic trailer with this DVD. So it's very much  worth your time and money! Plus...along with Barbarella, you get the foxy  and vivacious Great Tyrant! Ooh! ;)
B000001E7T|5.0|&quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; is easily my favourite album and one of  the very best ever! &quot;The Dancer&quot;, the closing track for the  album, is one of the most touching, brilliant and utterly devestating songs  I have ever heard, along with &quot;Roads&quot; by Portishead. But don't  you dare think that this song is the best song in the album, because THIS  album doesn't have a best song, they are all flawless masterpieces. Songs  like &quot;Meet Ze Monsta&quot; with the lyric &quot;big black monsoon,  take me with you&quot; and &quot;Long Snake Moan&quot; are cosmic and  terrifying, just amazing pieces of brilliance, surpassing everything Patti  Smith has ever done, songs like &quot;Teclo&quot; and &quot;I think I'm a  mother&quot; are triumphs of how a song can reach into your soul and just  take over, while songs like &quot;C'mon Billy&quot; and &quot;Send his Love  to Me&quot; under the beautiful string arrangements hide darker elements,  and are characteristic of the album's theme: love. But not the kind of love  that you hear from Celine Dion and Co., but destructive, passionate love,  love that defies logic. And also death, and religion and your very   existence. This is a remarkable album from start to finish. Buy it, put in  your stereo, turn out the lights, unplug the phones and you will experience  the glory of this album and of PJ Harvey. And don't you dare skip any  tracks because the demons in PJ Harvey's closet and in yours will certainly  hunt you down and destroy you. It's her voodoo working alright.
0792156684|4.0|Some critics have been complaining about James Cameron's script, and every complaint I've read or heard seems to miss the point.  What movie-goers did  NOT see/hear is the entire script: a polished, literate and thoroughly  professional piece of writing.  This includes stage directions, scene and  character descriptions, etc.  I think this is why so many who participated  in the making of the movie vigorously defended the script.  They'd read  what the audience never heard.  What viewers DID hear, unhappily, was  dialog that was often inane, anachronistic and unreal.  The distinction I  want to draw is between a great script as a whole and mediocre dialog.   Cameron showed poor taste in some of his choices of literary devices in  speech: a mild joke to relieve tension, for example, came across as a  preposterous line that wrecked the mood entirely.  As for the anachronisms,  I'm willing to overlook words and expressions of the 1990s put into a story  set in 1912.  If authentic dialog sounds fake to the audience,  communication is lost.  And this point brings me to the one thing that  really set me off:  Cameron's dropping &quot;the&quot; before the name of  the ship.  &quot;On Titanic's main deck ...&quot;  &quot;We're sailing on  Titanic.&quot;  No one, absolutely no one, ever talked this way, in 1912 or  any other time.  Dropping &quot;the&quot; before a ship's name is an  artificial convention invented in the 1930s by the famed historian Samuel  Eliot Morison.  He liked it, apparently.  His name carried great weight  (with justice) and he dictated that the phony usage should be adopted.   Some historians followed his lead, but fortunately the the practice seems  to be fading from history currently being written.  Not, however, from  James Cameron's script....  My only real question is this: How could  Cameron have researched the Titanic and her period so thoroughly and missed  the fact that the splendid liner was &quot;the Titanic&quot; to everyone  who ever mentioned her name at that time? ...  But he turned out one hell  of an entertaining movie.
B00000AFFI|5.0|&quot;Is This Desire?&quot; is one of those albums that have the ability  to enter the very depths of your soul and then just tear it apart. As with  her earliest masterpiece, the cocmic &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;, this  album manages to capture the very essense of desire, through 12 majestic  songs. All of the songs are unique and beautiful and it contains some  all-time classics, such as &quot;The Sky Lit Up&quot;, &quot;The  Wind&quot;, &quot;The Garden&quot; and the title track. But don't you  believe that the other songs are inferior. This record manages to send  shivers up your spine every time you hear it, and that is because it works  as a whole rather than a couple good songs. Different than &quot;To Bring  You My Love&quot;, the music is a bit toned down, so it will be able to  capture the melancholy and depressed passion expressed in the lyrics.  Desire in all its forms and emotions is in the core of this album.  Surrender to its beauty and the experience will be cathartic.
B000002UAX|5.0|It's not the most consistent album by any means from the beatles, but the  best moments show some of the greatest music ever put on a record.  The  premier trio of songwriters (Harrison had come into his own on this album)  all have their moments of sheer brilliance and amaze us with not only their  songwriting ability, but their musical ability also, the playing on this  album is something else and it proves that the Beatles are as good  musicians as they are songwriters.<br />It could be said that there is a fair  amount of fluff on the album but what this helps to show is that The  Beatles never took themselves that seriously.<br />&quot;Back in the  USSR&quot; is a great send up of Beach Boys Rock and roll.<br />&quot;Dear  Prudence&quot; possibly one of the most beautiful songs John Lennon ever  wrote and is only matched by &quot;Julia&quot; on this album. Lennon in  general on this album shines like a beacon with some of the best music he  has ever done with &quot;i'm so tired&quot; &quot;happiness is a warm  gun&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; which all show Lennons bitterness and  dissatisfaction will many aspects of life, but it does make for some great  music. McCartney deserves much credit for this album though with some great  rockers and some beautiful, soft, melodic songs such as &quot;i Will&quot;,  &quot;mother natures son&quot; and &quot;goodnight&quot; as well as his  most infamous song on the album &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; which shows the  beatles could still rock. By the time of this album though Harrison had  come into his own as a songwriter with his best effort being &quot;while my  guitar gently weeps&quot;, a beatiful and yet despairing song made all the  better by Eric Claptons guitar playing, &quot;long long long&quot; isn't  far behind either as well as the harpsichord driven  &quot;piggies&quot;.<br />Despite it's shaky moments, the good points easily  outweigh the bad, otherwise countless generations of people would not still  be listening to it.  And it most certainly wouldn;t still have the cult  status it has kept for the last 32 years. This is the album where they show  just how untouchable they are and for an overwhelmingly penetrating listen,  buy this album and you'll never question them again.
B000001FQI|5.0|Don't you just love it when artists take risks with thier sound and image, and the listening public gets to reap the rewards? Curt Smith and Roland  Orzabal are a prime example, when this duo took an eternity following up  the multi-million selling &quot;Songs From The Big Chair&quot;, fans were  beginning to wonder if thier success was a one time fluke. But from the  first time &quot;Sowing The Seeds Of Love&quot; was played on the radio,  and the million dollar video (one of the best ever produced) began airing  on MTV, they effectively blew everyone away!  Instead of following the safe  path and producing a remake of the last album, they took 4 years, wrote  some deeply personal songs, set them to ambitious, sprawling musical  arrangements and became true ARTISTS.  Opening with &quot;Woman In  Chains&quot; is a bold move in itself, a slow meandering, soul drenched  ballad featuring the wonderfully emotive vocals of Oleta Adams, the group  chooses not to knock you over the head with a fast, hook laden pop number,  but rather they make you pay attention, listen and relax. &quot;Badman's  Song&quot; is a lengthy, rave-up with some of Roland Orzabal's best  singing, a backing choir, and very tight playing from a crack backing band.  The title track is without question the band's greatest recorded triumph  combining much of The Beatles late period music into one brilliant 6:15  song, an accomplishment that remains untouched by imitators to this day.  This masterpiece was justifiably a hit and the group's creative peak.  &quot;Advice For The Young At Heart&quot; is the most overtly hook-ey song  on the album and a great showcase for Curt Smith's gentle, soaring voice  (check out his falsetto on the bridge), and sports an elegant, jazzy  arrangement that leaves the listener floating on a cloud. &quot;Standing On  The Corner Of The Third World&quot; is a languid ballad that continues in  the same classy vein as &quot;Advice...&quot;, but slows the tempo down  considerably, cradling you in it's warmth. &quot;Swords And Knives&quot;  starts the same way, but immediately picks up the pace and houses one of  the prettiest melodies you'll ever hear on a pop record, it will remain in  your brain for quite sometime. &quot;Year Of The Knife&quot; is introduced  by the sound of a loud, cheering audience and dives into a blistering, hard  rock/progressive jazz sound that fits in perfectly with the rest of this  program. Again, Roland Orzabal strethes his voice to new dimensions on this  selection, the presence of Oleta seems to bring him newfound soul and  inspiration. &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; is simply a heartbreaking vision  of the apocalypse set to even more haunting music, and closes the album on  a note that is both saddening and thought provoking. 8 songs, spread out  over nearly 50 minutes, and not a single note is wasted.  Tears For Fears  were obviously not interested in just releasing 'product' and the effort  they put into this kaleidescope of sounds, images and textures is evident.  This is simply brilliant music, made for people with intellect and an  attention span. It also gets my vote for &quot;Best Album Cover of  1989&quot;.  The creativity shown in assembling this &quot;Sgt.  Pepper&quot; inspired sleeve spills over into the music, and the listener  is rewarded.  Buy this LP immediately, and it will become an indespensible  part of your collection.y, cradling you in it's warmth. &quot;Swords And Knives&quot;  starts the same way, but immediately picks up the pace and houses one of  the prettiest melodies you'll ever hear on a pop record, it will remain in  your brain for quite sometime. &quot;Year Of The Knife&quot; is introduced  by the sound of a loud, cheering audience and dives into a blistering, hard  rock/progressive jazz sound that fits in perfectly with the rest of this  program.

B000002TQV|5.0|These guys really know how to wind you up! The music on this album from start to finish is startling emotional and very very unpredictable which  means writing a review for the album in less than 1000 words is a very  tricky thing to do.<br />But here goes:<br />The thing about radiohead is that  they are geniuses of experementation in the studio and create some of the  most densley creative soundscapes you're ever likely to hear from any album  (except OK Computer).  But at the same time they love to play like a  anthemic U2 style rock band which they do very sucsessfully thanks to the  accomplished playing from all the members of the group helping to bring the  music into sharper focus.  What makes the album work well though is the way  they switch between the two and the way it keeps you interested throughout.  &quot;Planet Telex&quot; is a heavily produced echoey song which sounds  like it was made on another planet with the music made even more distant by  thom Yorkes screaming vocals which painfully break the music down.  &quot;The Bends&quot; though shows their love of just simply rocking  without abandon with a powerful chord that charges into the song like a  bullet, when the music stops however we see the depressiveness of this  album as yorke says, &quot;where do we go from here&quot; showing a deep  vat of lonliness that he feels, bringing the song into much closer  inspection before rocking out again. &quot;High and Dry&quot; is a  beautiful melodic song with very dark undertones to it &quot;don't leave me  high, don't leave me dry&quot;.  But to hear Yourke sing it it seems like  more of a love song than anything else, but on closer inspection you see  what it's all about.  &quot;fake plastic Trees&quot; is and sounds like a  thorougly depressing song about how our lives have become cheap imitations  of what the real thing is showing how empty our lives have become and the  fact we're missing the most important things &quot;whee's the love?&quot;  as yorke says. &quot;Bones&quot; is a great song, i don't know why it just  is (give me a break music isn't that deep really)! &quot;Nice Dream&quot;  is just that, it's a song that is beautiful while it's playing but then you  can't quite remember it afterwards, weird huh?. &quot;Just&quot; is Just  great, it's a fantastic rocker that prevents the album from alienating  listeners too much, evryone can &quot;rock out&quot; to this one. &quot;My  Iron Lung&quot; is an achingly melodic song with an excellent guitar motif  at the start which belies the painful lyrics that go with it before  spiraling downwards into a hard rocking set of power chords in a way only  Radiohead could pull off.   Basically without going on too long this  becomes the format of the album with the music hopping between OK Computer  style soundscapes and classic rockers.  But what always sets this music  apart from any other music from the 90's is the lyrics and voice of Thom  Yorke which sound thoroughly depressing yet strangely life affirming.  I  don't know anyone who has sat down to this album and felt thoroughly  depressed, it's not so much a message that says &quot;life is horrible lets  all kill ourselves&quot; but more a statement saying &quot;what can we do  to make our lives better&quot;?  I love this album and no matter what mood  i am in i can listen to it and always be happy again.<br />A masterpiece
B00000J2KT|5.0|this movie is absolutely unbelievable. everything about it is good. it is as if the camera men went to a real boot camp and filmed this. it is so  real. my uncle was in the marine corps and he said this movie is a vivid  picture of what he went through before going to vietnam. if that isn't  enough proof to show how good the movie is i don't know what is. all the  elements of war are in this film. i take my hat of to the boot camp  sergeant. was he a real sergeant, because it sure looked like it. full  metal jacket, shows the downside of war, and the upsides of war, although  there aren't that many. private joker, gomer pyle, private snowball, all  these names are the people youu will get to know in this movie. it is a  depiction in what the boot camps are like in this time. i give it a high  five!
B000002UB3|5.0|If there's anything that shows us that the Beatles were the greatest band  ever, it is the fact that they were able to make an album thst sounds so  unified so close to the end.<br />It's probably not their best album, but it  still ranks as one of their best.<br />The Beatles have continued to move  forward in their studio experementation using moog synthesiser and creating  an intelligent medley of songs on side 2 of the album. Lennons songs on the  first side stick in the mind with &quot;come together&quot; a brillant  memorable track and &quot;I want you&quot; which is weird yet wonderful.   At this time , McCartney seemed to be going the other way with some more  portentous efforts such as &quot;golden slumbers/carry that weight/the  end&quot; vingette on side 2, but &quot;Maxwells silver Hammer&quot; is a  devilishley humurous and black song which you can only laugh at really.   &quot;Because&quot; probably contains one of the best harmonies you are  ever likely to hear on a song with soaring melody throughout.  George  Harrisons contributions to the album are second to none with  &quot;something&quot; one of the best love songs by any of the Beatles and  &quot;here comes the sun&quot; a beautiful, chiming and melodic song that  fits into the albums fold perfectly. You can't help but enjoy Ringos  &quot;Octopus Garden&quot; which is a lovely singalong which fits his voice  perfectly. What make the album work as a whole though is the felling of  unification in the group and the excellent production and songwriting of he  album. The playing has also reached a new level on this album with all the  instrumentation from the group reaching a new level of excellence. The only  thing that prevents it from being their best is that &quot;Revolver&quot;  was better!<br />Buy it now!
B000003BF4|5.0|The collage of Sam cutler was a great idea. He coined the phrase that the  stones have been carrying ever since&quot;The Greatest R&amp;R Band in the  world&quot;. But right away the excitement is palpable. Bass is tuning up.  Those were the days when a drummer had to make his Snare talk by being a  badass drummer, instead of relying on effects to do that for him like  today. Charlie's snare is magic. &quot;Jumping Jack Flash is as tight as  can be. NO frills. &quot;Carol&quot; has Keith in heaven answering everyone  of Jagger's lines with one of his own. &quot;Stray Cat Blues&quot; takes on  a completely different feel in the live arena. It is big and majestic.  Taylor Solos are outstanding and the rhythm guitar during the bridges is  just classic Keith. &quot;Love In Vain&quot; is stunning. Beginning with  the rhythm section, Watts uses beautiful swells on the Ride and crash  cymbals, but ever so soft, while Bill is all over the place. Remember we  are talking about a SLOW Blues here. Keith is the anchor who picks the  basic chords. jagger delivers the great lyrics with none of the -isms, that  would later sometimes taint his delivery. but &quot;Love In Vain&quot; for  his whole tenure with the Stones was always Taylor's baby. His Slide and  his solos will never NOT leave you in awe. &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; has  come a long way since &quot;Let it Bleed&quot;. It was truly frightening in  the Studio. Live it becomes a Showstopper, with the fast part going at  110mph's and jagger already doing the voodoo on the chicas, and then of  course the slow middlepart on this disc had not yet developed into the  theatrical piece that Jagger would turn it into. But did it ever need it?  You clearly hear the crowd in between the BOMP's! And they are wild.  &quot;Sympathy&quot; is just outstanding with Keith and Taylor really  showing each other their best side of a Solo. Watts and Wyman just keeping  the train at full speed. &quot;Live With Me&quot; is short and excellent.Keith as the anchor and Taylor as the doubleanchor. Both guitars playing  very straightforward and every once in a while one of them will bust out a  few lines. The feel is EVERYTHING in &quot;Little Queenie&quot; It is  perfect! Wyman is great. (Man I miss him) Jagger is superb and Keith in his  own private heaven, &quot;&quot;Honky Tonk Woman&quot;. It was probably the  last time they played it really the way they loved it. It got too choppy as  time goes on, because the press could not quit about the minimalistic  approack of the &quot;less is more&quot; and open G-Tuning. To me this has  always been one of the absolute best versions of &quot;Street Fighting  Man&quot;. Jagger is said not to like this song too much. A lot I think had  to do with Taylor being gone, because by now everything on stage is at  Volume and energy 11! Wyman playing the famous Bassline, Keith and Charlie  just flayling away at 8 beats per bar, with the two Micks really running  it. Jagger showering the crowds with roses, Taylor with runs up and down  the fretboard. He would go on later to get even wilder at it. But even  though they did some overdubs, they did them for the sake of the Fans.  &quot;This it what we want to say to you&quot; and if it takes afew  overdubs to get it right, fine. The BEST!
B00004T9UF|3.0|On this LP, slim trys a lot of things and the production of this album  helps to push these ideals and beleifs along, the problem is, he never  really says that much despite being brutlally honest about things, and when  he does say something interesting and insightful, you can't really ever  take it too seriously, after all he doesen't.  But once you get past the  lyrics which are at times too overwhelming for the average listener,  everyone can appreciate the excellent production work Dr dre has done on  this album, the bass is populsive and in your face, the melodies played on  the keyboards create quite an amazing soundscape and the feeling of rhythm  and timing on this album is second to none.<br />Despite slims attempts at  times being somewhat flawed by the fact he is trying to be almost too  honest there are times when what he does say really does hit home.  Stan  for me is the song that makes this album.  The lyrics are very good and  does give the message quite clearly that you have to take everything slim  says with a pinch of salt, the emotion in the song feels genuine and the  tragic end is something that could haunt you.  Hovever, as sophmore efforts  go this is pretty good, but i think slim needs to find his own voice  somewhat, we now know a lot about him and it's time for him to talk about  something beyond his own mind in order to gain a wider audience.  But  still, nice work slim!
0767903854|3.0|Much like listening to grandpa's long drawn out stories.  you know they  can be funny and that there is a point to them...you just wish he'd get to  the point!  Bryson is able to find the humor in the most unlikely places,  this time in Australia's vast expanses. But he tends to ramble and drag on  and become tedious.
B000002HAF|3.0|I've heard Talking Heads' David Byrne cry like a wounded geek (River Euphrates). I've heard the B-52s fifties housewife camp rock (Bone Machine,  Broken Fist). I've heard the Ramones' two-chord speed derivatives  (Something Against You, Broken Face). I've heard the spit-in-your-face anger of the Sex Pistols (Break My Body). I've also heard vulgar expletives  so many times (Vamos, Brick Is Red) that they're meaningless. Get a  thesaurus, select a few suitable synonyms, and use them. I've got $100 that  says Adam Sandler is the lead singer on `Cactus' and `Oh My  Golly!'<br /><br />Surfer Rosa by the Pixies is the CD that I love to hate. The more  I get accustomed to its stop-go composition structure, the easier it is to  discover hidden melodies and rhythm, and some clever humor. `Gigantic' is  an energetic rocker with a vibrant bass rhythm and an attractive melody.  The melody is there, it just isn't strong enough for me to want to sing  along (at least not yet). `Tony's Theme' is filled with sunny Ventures'  surf guitar, and there is a touch of sarcasm to the title. I have a gut  feeling that the bass guitar work of Mrs. John Murphy isn't quite as  amateur as she lets on - check her sophisticated chord manipulation on  `Cactus.\\" The knockout here is `Where Is My Mind?' The cut features a  gorgeous rhythm guitar and some angelic voices from heaven. There's  something else very important that I noticed about Surfer Rosa. I believe  that the Pixies are having \\"fun.\\" You remember don't you. Fun. It's an  activity that one usually gives up at about age thirty to pursue other more  mature goals such as opening an Individual Retirement Account. Fun is a  good thing. The Pixies are fun. The Pixies are good.
B0000047CX|5.0|The true  bossa nova must be played low, the purists say. And that's what  Joao tried to explain Stan Getz during the recordings while he blew his sax  like a madman(so the story says). Nevertheless Getz got to do the final  mixings afterwards and you know what ? He decided the sax sounded too low !  All this to explain what you'll hear here - after the delicate and  intricate vocalizations from Joao and Astrud, Getz sax comes from nowhere  like a hurricane, threatening to blow your speakers away. Now that's not  very bossa nova, but still this is one of the best cds ever...
B000001FFJ|3.0|Rain Dogs is one of several items in my collection that I'm \\"supposed to\\"  appreciate, but rarely listen to. The reason I say \\"supposed to\\" appreciate  is because Waits is a critic's darling, a musical vanguard, an artist's  artist. No argument from me on that point: Rain Dogs falls easily into the  category of \\"novel,\\" and his first rate \\"I've been down so long\\" poetry is  as moving as that of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. When Waits' sticks to the  minimum contemporary standard of melody, harmony and rhythm; his  compositions are tender examples of melancholy. `Hang Down Your Head,'  `Time,' `Downtown Train,' and `Anywhere I Lay My Head' are accessible,  melodic and heartbreaking. The key to the success of these tracks is  \\"accessibility.\\" They're \\"musical\\" and accessible because they provide a  melodic framework for Waits' poetry.<br />Other tracks may be defined as  either primal, rough or boring; depending on perspective. `Singapore'  sounds like a march. Disagreeing with Waits' fans, tracks such as `Midtown'  and `9th &amp; Hennepin' are simply \\"abrasive noise,\\" not musical  compositions. Rain Dogs contains some the finest tearful compositions ever  penned, and some of the worst garbage anyone has attempted to pass off as  music. Love him or hate him, Tom Waits is Mr. Alternative, a trailblazing  rule breaker.
6303913881|5.0|Showgirls is one of my favorite movies, but many people just don't get the point of it. Escapism and entertainment at the movies I guess have become  out of style. Hello, the whole point of going to the movies is to have fun  and Showgirls delivers the goods!  This movie is schlocky, ok I admit it,  but it sure is entertaining. It's kind of a cult classic now and for good  reason.  Elizabeth Berkley, from Saved by the Bell tv fame, is Nomi, a  wannabe dancer who claws her way to the top of a Vegas hotel show,  encountering colorful characters and seedy situations along the way. She's  ruthless but vulnerable, and you want her to succeed,to be the best, but  you don't like her methods of getting there. But then you can't help but  applaud her for knowing at the end that all of the fame and money in the  world isn't worth losing your self-respect. I loved Gina Gershon as  Crystal, Vegas show Goddess reigning queen. Gina is one of the best  actresses out there...see Bound and you'll know what I mean. She has great  onscreen chemistry with Ms Berkley and their frail strained relationship  finally culminates into a deep understanding between them about what you  have to give up to have it all. They're like sisters in their relentless  ambitions. Sure the dialogue is laughably bad, but the atmosphere of Vegas  is dead-on. Paul Verhoeven did a fantastic job of capturing all the sleaze  behind the new Disneyland and the music, sets and dancing are fabulous. The  show Goddess itself is way over the top, and I do mean way over the top,  but so mesmerizing that you'll feel like a voyeur watching from just meters  away. But what a show!  See this movie and judge for yourself.
6305858764|3.0|This movie is a bit difficult to review because of some real highs and lows.  The plot seems a bit farfetched.  A father, meeting a young man who  claims to have known his son in college, pays him $1000 to go to Italy to  persuade the son to come back home.  (I kept wondering why the father  himself didn't go or why he didn't just cut off his allowance.)  Two of the  bright spots are the beautiful Italian scenery (really does make you want  to visit) and the acting of Jude Law, the spoiled, erratic son who is  wasting away his life in Italy.  He makes a rather sterotyptical character  seem complicated and sinister.  The pace of the movie is good and did keep  up my interest, wondering what these troubled young people were going to do  next.  Gwyneth Paltrow played Jude Law's love interest and seemed like a  doormat for his eccentric whims.  Matt Damon discovers that he likes Law's  and Paltrow's lifestyle and goes to any lengths to make sure that it  continues.  He attaches himself to them and learns the mannerisms and  habits of the idle rich.  When they tire of him, the action turns decidedly  dark.  The last part of the movie is the weakest and the viewer is left  rather empty and disappointed at the end.
0345350499|5.0|This is a big book and glad it is, because as each page turns, you want it  to keep continuing.  It is about the intuitive powers of women and  reinforces the possibility that we all have those powers within us.  There  is romance, mystery and fantasy.  This would be enjoyable mostly to those  who believe in intuitive powers.
0671034065|4.0|This is one of the most entertaining books I have read recently.  I love  the banter between Sam and Jaine - I was completely enchanted with them.  I  would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading and can stay up all  night to read it from start to finish which is what I did.  I simply  couldn't put it down.

079284470X|5.0|In this movie, the old John Wannemaker Dept. store in Philidelphia is  used. It is the beautiful old dept. store in danger of closing and John and  the Mannequin to unusual window scenes to bring customers into the store.  That store shows the need to preserve older buildings in their original  form. Not gut the insides out and rebuilt the inner section. In fact, in  Washington D.C., the Woodward and Lothrop dept. store is about to be torn  apart, all of the beautiful designs in that building are almost gone. If  you do something to an old building, take away something original to it, it  is gone forever. As I am saying, this movie shows the need for historic  preservation.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|After seeing the original and special edition Star Wars Trilogy, I can honestly say that this is probably going to be the best version of them  all, and with widescreen to see more of the movies'. As if the Trilogy  wasn't enough, Lucas Films has put 10 minutes of Episode 2 which should  make all Star Wars fan love this version of the movies than the others made  before it. Though I haven't seen it yet, I'm sure it deserves 5 stars and  that this is a movie made for everybody.
B00003CX59|5.0|I saw this movie 3 times in the theater and I could watch it a zillion more!  The atmosphere, characters, plot, architecture, and director all  worked together to convey this creepy flick.  Of course, with Tim Burton  you're gonna have a dark film with characters to match.  Although the movie  doesn't match the sketch by Washington Irving 100%, it is still an A+++  feature. <br />Defininately, one of the best parts is when the Hessian enters  the house of the midwife, her husband, and their son.  Is it that dreadful  Christopher Walken!   No!   It's the one-and-only Ray Park!  So if you  liked Darth Maul in Star Wars, all his spectacular saber-fighting, you're  gonna love Ray's axe battles! I know I did; but I LOVE Ray Park  ;)<br />Besides Ray, Johnny Depp provided another wonderful, creepy, and  downright humorous performance. Even if you're not a Depp, Park, Ricci,  Walken, or Burton fan, you need to see this movie. There's nothing more  exciting than seeing some heads get lopped off by a headless horse-rider!
B00004TDRD|5.0|When i saw this movie as a kid i was almost scared to death,but the the movie was old and the sound and  picture qualety was bad.But now FINALLY i  can see this movie with crystall clear picture and sound without buying an  dvd-player is that good or what.Anyway a great movie and i highly recomend  that you buy it.(the Collectors edition of course,i guess youv'e allready  seen the old version before)
0767817478|3.0|What I have to say here will probably upset a lot of G-fans, but I honestly didn't like the Japanese Godzilla films. They were all pretty much  the same story recycled over and over: a grown man in a fakey rubber lizard  suit, trashing a cardboard replica of downtown Tokyo. And that horrible  dubbing, PUHLEEEEEEEZE!  The later films that were made within the last  ten years, I will grant you, were somewhat better in terms of F/X and  dubbing, but that's still not saying much.<br />I, personally, found the 1998  American version a whole lot more entertaining. It was a fast-paced, fun,  awe-inspiring rollercoaster ride! The story may not have been on the level  of Shakespeare nor, for that matter, the caliber of acting. Still, for me,  it was a major improvement. Roland Emmerich had stated, in no uncertain  terms, that he had deliberately ignored the Japanese mythos behind  Godzilla. Clearly, there were many moviegoers who did not realize this.  They were among the hardcore Godzilla fans who very foolishly assumed the  creature in this film was carried over from the original releases and would  cross the ocean to pick up in New York where he left off in Japan. If, like  them, you went in expecting a scenario like this, of course you were  disappointed. This was, after all, in the director's own words, an entirely  different animal.<br />Yes, the film was a tad overlong, and the human  characters may have spent more time onscreen than they should have. But, I  have to say, this was still every bit the movie Emmerich had promised. I  saw it four times in the theater, twice with my father who, despite his  prior misgivings, absolutely loved it! It's all a matter of what you look  for in a film like this. You just have to know how to approach it. If you  don't take it too seriously, you will find it is actually a whole heckuva'  lot of fun.
B0000009RT|5.0|Even though this is Zappa's first album I think its one of his best. FZ will never leave you not wondering what he meant in the lyrics of the  songs. Sometimes its hard to figure out what he means in the songs and it  will make you listen to the song over and over again to understand what  he's saying. I think by doing that its made me a bigger fan everytime by  hearing his music over and over again.
B00003CXGP|1.0|It's not that bad for a movie that was obvisously only finaced because some fat hollywood producer was hunting for more copies of a 'gen X' black  comedy fight club clone, satirical? sure it was meant to be the 1980's but  we have progressed, the movie is naive of it stupidity.   Christian Bale is  perhaps the most tragic figure here, having altered his face and body so  dramatically to play a role that spits him out onto the screen and makes  him look like a tragic copy of Tom Cruise. If you see the film and you hate  it, read the book, no print to screen translation can be worse than this,  seriously.
B00004RFDW|5.0|Al Pacino's character says it best in one scene:  &quot;They're ordinary people under extraordinary pressure.  What do you expect--grace and  consistency?&quot;  A bit slow, but very rewarding.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I can't tell you if i like it or hate it. I have had it for 2 months and i  still don't know. Some parts are funny. Some parts way to extreme. what is  going on with slimy. WORD OF CAUTION DO NOT LET ANYONE UNDER 18 LISTEN TO  THIS.
B000002H5I|5.0|Wow... Tracy's strong, unique voice shows us what we can't always see, or  choose not to. Tracy's song &quot;Behind the Wall&quot; which is sung  acapella sends a chill through my body, and tears to my eyes. Chapman's  music is uncomparable to work of others... talent, and truth seeps from her  mouth, and delights my ears. I can't explain the true brilliance of this  album, but deeply encourage you to purchase it.
B00004U1F8|5.0|When I first saw 'Ghostbusters' I was blown away. I mean four guys going around New York catching ghosts, I find something entertaining about it.  The blend of comedy and action is terrific. When I first saw the previews I  knew I had to see it. The special effects are fantastic. Now I have  purchased the movie and I watch it frequently.<br />When I heard that a sequel  was being made, I didn't believe it. I thought that a sequel would in a way  be bad for 'Ghostbusters'. Most of the sequels that I saw didn't do the  first movie justice. I feared that the 'Ghostbusters' sequel would give  'Ghostbusters' a bad name. But I saw the movie anyway. After I saw it I was  plesantly suprised. I in fact liked the sequel, 'Ghostbusters II', more  than the original. The comedy was funnier. The action was more exciting.  And the special effects were out of this world. Sadly I don't own  'Ghostbusters II', but I surely rent it a lot. I can't wait to see the  series again. I do recommend this series of films to anyone and everyone.
B000021Y74|5.0|I just rented the subtitled version of this movie (after it was  consistently unavailable at my local video store for the past three  months). Other renters must have been holding it hostage. Absolutely loved  it! Watched it three times back to back. Will definitely buy this gem at  first opptortunity. Any die-hard Hollywood moviegoers squeamish of arty,  foreign language films will need to get over it if they're ichin' to see a  first-rate action/adventure movie. And I loved the music as well (the  soundtrack is also a keeper!). The music played an essential role to the  story-telling (especially in the beginning where it sets the frenetic  pace). I can go on and on about it, but just watch it and see for  yourselves. And I strongly recommend the subtitled version. I haven't seen  the English dubbed version, but I found that the German version added to  the richness of the story's setting (at least it did for me). Enjoy!
B000002LQR|5.0|It doesn't have the same number of hits or eventual singles.  It is  however still its equal their first huge success.  For many a god reason  its been around for 8 years and is still popular.
052594527X|2.0|I found this novel impossible to finish, mainly because the clumsy,  self-conscious style started to grate with me pretty quickly. The narrator  is a servant girl; so the author adopts what she thinks is a child-like  narrative voice. But this does not stop her indulging in an endless parade  of clumsy metaphors. Eyes are 'gray like the sea'; hair 'red like wet  brick', her mother's eyes are 'two warnings' (because she has two eyes? Oh  dear) - and all this on page 1. The idea, it appears, is that, despite her  lack of education, this simple girl is possessed of an artist's eye. But do  painters think in endless drab metaphors? I doubt it. Visual art, by  definition, is a process that's impossible to evoke in words. And these  artless efforts, for me at least, fell woefully short. While there are some  carefully researched period details, this doesn't compensate for for an  dreary prose style that never feels anything other than late 20th Century.
B00000253N|5.0|Wonderful, eclectic, heartfelt and amazing.  Buy it, plug it in the CD and  it will stay there.  His best work.
6304362498|4.0|Michael Radford, better known for the sweet-tempered (and to me, insufferably heart-tugging) &quot;Il Postino&quot;, made his early mark  with this fine movie.  He and his production designer do an excellent job  in bringing the grungy half-life of Orwell's novel to the screen.  John  Hurt is, as usual, superb, although from his very first appearance he looks  so baffled and hurt (appropriate name for this actor) that I'd have tagged  him as a thought-criminal straight away.  Suzanna Hamilton is extremely  good as Julia, not just fitting my idea of what Julia would look like but  wonderfully vulnerable and real.  (Glad to see that she's gone on to do  fine work elsewhere.)  Even Cyril Cusack, who I saw on stage in Dublin as  one of the most nauseatingly indulged Shylocks ever, is great as the  mild-mannered Thought Policeman.<br />Special word for Richard Burton in his  last film role - quiet, gravelly, almost visibly dying, and never less than  riveting.  Shame he had to wait all his life for such a good role.<br />The  Eurythmics did a fair bit of the music, and I can't think of a better band  to have provided music for a totalitarian state.  Unfortunately they tried  to come on all romantic, and are wisely kept down in the mix.  Far better  is Dominic Muldowney's largely unnoticed contribution as official composer  - his faux-fascist anthems have an unnerving, alluring power, maybe because  they're not a million miles away from any typical national anthem.<br />It was  shot in the London Docklands, the same location Kubrick used for the urban  bits of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;.  In those days they were derelict  and falling apart.  Now they're full of bright, clean offices and light  industry.  With which another bit of the England Orwell was nostalgic for  got bulldozed over.
B000002H2H|5.0|Everyone says that &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is the best Metallica CD,  but they're wrong.  This one is.  Every song on it conveys a serious  message, along with awesome sounding music.  Here's the breakdown:<br />1.   Fight Fire With Fire - This song opens with a soft sound, but it quickly  picks up speed for all those concerned about that.  It's about the end of  the world in nuclear armegeddon.  In 1984, when the album came out, Ronald  Reagan was up for re-election and he was for nuclear arms.  Naturally, the  issue was on a lot of people's minds.  Maybe somebody in congress heard the  song, because we're still here. ; )<br />2.  Ride the Lightening - The title  track is a bit overly long, but it's still a great song about anti-death  penalty, from the persective of the guy walkin' the mile.<br />3.  For Whom  the Bells Tolls - I haven't read my Hemingway in years, but I doubt that  the title is a coincidence.  A very powerful opening with the bell tolling,  and almost two minutes of awesome music before Jaymz starts to sing.  This  is a great song about war, but I have to admit, Desposable Heroes on  &quot;Puppets&quot; is better for lyrics, but not sound!<br />4.  Fade to  Black - Every album takes a break for the softer side of life, and this one  is no exception.  The music here is much calmer, but just as good.  This is  about what goes through the mind of somebody just before they committ  suicide.  Oh, I'm sure it sounds to parents like it's pro-suicide, but I  think it tries to convey a deeper meaning.<br />5.  Trapped Under Ice - This  one is very forceful after the the softer Fade to Black.  It begans almost  immediately with a wild riff and from then on, it doesn't let up.  Some  people say it's about drowning, but I think it's a metaphor for  helplessness in general, and it can be applied to many situations.<br />6.   Escape - An instant classic!  The music isn't as hammering as Trapped Under  Ice was, but the message is simply beautiful!  It's about doing what you  want and not conforming to society's little standards.  The line, &quot;See  them try to bring the hammer down; no damn chains can hold me to the  ground!&quot; followed by a siren is just awesome!  This is one of my  all-time favorites.<br />7.  Creeping Death - Another classic!  This one has  awesome music and is still popular at concerts today, even after Metallica  changed their style.<br />8.  The Call of Ktulu - This one is an awesome  finisher.  There are no words, which makes it even better, because you can  lose yourself in the music and imagine anything you want.  When the song  ends with its slam-bang sound, you can't help but think, &quot;Damn, what  an awesome album!&quot;  I actually listened to it all again!<br />&quot;Ride  the Lightening&quot; is perfect in every way.  The serious topics make it  very intelligent, and the awesome sound makes it perfectly entertaining.   &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; only comes in at a hair's width second-place.   It sold millions of copies right off the bat without one single or music  video.  I think it owes its success to &quot;Ride the Lightening,&quot;  because if it wasn't for that album, people wouldn't have ran to the record  store in such a crazed frenzy after hearing that the band released another  one.  It would have been just as successful in the end, but &quot;Ride the  Lightening&quot; was what really defined the Band's popularity.<br />As Lars  Ulrich himself said of the album on this very website, the band DID focus  more on melody than just crashing guitars, and it WAS a really cool album.
6304983778|5.0|I love this movie! I have watched it so many times, not because it is believeable, but because it allows you to fantasize and become a child  again. I originally taped it and now am ordering the video because I wore  my tape out. I took the tape to France and showed it to a three-year-old.  He didn't understand any of the words, but he was mesmerized by the movie.  Anyone who doesn't see the fantasy in this is a stuffed shirt who needs to  lighten up!
B00000BKDV|4.0|i actually give this album 4.5 stars but since you cant give half stars  and this album is certainly not worth 5 stars(masterpiece) i had to give it  4. people who say this album is maidens best probably have never heard any  others of maiden. this is not a bad thing though because the first maiden  album i got was piece of mind and until i got another maiden album i  thought it was the best album ever.but then i got number of the beast and 7  son of 7 son and realised that this album had too many weak tracks( 3-  revelations, quest for fire, sun and steel) to live up to the maiden  standard. however these tracks are only weak for iron maiden, if another  band made them they would be classics. i reccomend this album to anyone new  to maiden as it will prepare for their other albums. UP THE IRONS!!!
158234082X|4.0|At least for this guy!  I didn't find this book funny, though there was some (very) dark humor in it and a few really hilarious laugh-out-loud  passages. I don't understand why people like to laugh at those pathetic  souls throwing their lives and talents away. That said, I must admit I  couldn't put this book down.  The high points for me were the advice on  what kind of kitchen equipment is useful to have; the advice on what to  look for, what not to order in a restaurant; the interesting descriptions  of restaurants and the owners.  The low points: well, Mr. Bourdain comes  across as a real low-life; he sneers at the common, Great Unwashed, tacky  hordes of tourists and weekend diners cluttering up restaurants he toils  in. Hey, Bub, we're paying your salary!(This is akin to a piano, if it  could talk, protesting anyone except Mozart pounding on its keyboard!)  There are long, loving descriptions of the many geeks and freaks he has  befriended and worked with, and just as many long, loving descriptions of  the many drug benders,toots,runs and all-nighters they indulged themselves  in, though how they managed to go to work every day is beyond me. (Note to  self: if served another bad restaurant meal, storm the kitchen, determine  if chef is conscious.)  There is a shadowy wife mentioned but what part she  played in all this is ignored completely. (Not that I was exactly  interested in, say,  what the color scheme was for their wedding; but  didn't his wife notice their Christmas tree was still up in August, and why  couldn't she dispose of it?)  I grew weary and disgusted with Mr.  Bourdain's non-stop doping and drifting, but I loved reading about food and  restaurants and kitchen knives.  One thing stood out, a chef's job is  difficult and dangerous, and the hours are long.  I recommend this book,  but mostly as a hair raising autobiography. Please read &quot;The Making of  a Chef&quot; by Michael Ruhlman for a more &quot;palatable&quot; and  in-depth book about chef-ery and the love of food.chef-ery and the love of food.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|this is probably maiden' best album since 7th son of 7th son(i liked  futureal and fear of the dark too)but it is definitely not their best ever  or even close. for one thing, the sonic maiden sound has changed a bit with  heavier, louder guitars. there is no problem with this but the riffs are no  longer technical and as melodic as before. also the choruses are reapeated  much too much making one think that they are in a time continuum. and  another thing, some songs such as the wicker man and out of silent planet  have too many modern rock sounding riffs while the thin line between line  between love and hate is modern rock!!(just listen to the chorus!!) i hope  htat maiden will realise this and cahnge it on their next album which i  anticipate eagerly. all in all this a great album and all maiden fans  should buy it-they shall not be dissapointed!! UP THE IRONS!!!
0375707972|4.0|&quot;The Reader&quot; was a book that was very difficult to read and more  difficult to put down.  It was over-whelming to read again of the  atrocities that were allowed to occur in Germany during the war, but also  it opened up my mind to know those atrocities did happen over and over  without people doing anything to stop them.  It made me question myself and  what I would have done had I lived in that era?  I was surprised at the  ending, but now feel, it couldn't have ended any other way.  I was &quot;in  that era&quot; for a very long time after reading the book.
B000002KDO|4.0|its funny, you people will give 5 stars to anything even if only half the tracks are good! for one thing the album is much to short. another thing is  that htere are three pointless acoustic tracks spread out in the album.  finally the only excellent songs are sweet leaf, children of hte grave, and  into hte void. the other to songs worth listening to are after forever and  lord of this world. the other 3 are rubbish. you have to understand htat 5  stars means masterpiece and masterpieces can have no weak songs. i have  only heard 3 masterpieces so far and they are iron maiden's number of beast  and 7th son of a 7th son and black sabbath's sabbath bloody sabbath. oyu  also have to understand that 3.85 stars means htat it is a very good album  and worthy of being bought but it is certainly no masterpiece
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is the best cd...... it contains around the world, scar tissue,  californication, and otherside, four awesome songs
B00000BKDZ|5.0|this is a maiden masterpiece. from the spectactualar intro to the final  riff this album demonstrates that maiden can make heavy yet melodic albums  with scorching riffs and plenty of our european emotion. the first time i  listened to it i thought it wasnt so great becuase of its very progressive  feel, but after listening to it 2 or 3 more times i realised just how good  it was.now 2 years later i listen to this at least once a day!! UP THE  IRONS!!!
B00000IMCW|1.0|I don't understand all of the reviews above on this film.  My honest opinion is, that this was simply one of the worst films I have ever seen,  if the worst.  The ending was terrible, unrealistic, and poorly acted.  The  special f/x were the only thing good about the film, but it was still too  gory for a 1970's movie.  I felt I was watching a &quot;Faces of  Death&quot; film, with a little bit of comedy in the mix.  Please do not  eat while watching this film.  I saw this movie for the first time a few  months ago on Cinemax.  I wanted to see what all of the talk was about on  this film.  Two and a half hours later I found out.  The film was so corny,  that I taped it and brought it to my cousin the same day to watch and  suffer through.  He felt the same way as I do, and was angry that I  suckered him into watching a movie like that. I guess that because I was  bitter about the movie, I had to take my anger out on someone else.   Unfortunately, it was my innocent by-stander cousin.  It was definately 2  1/2 hours of our lives that we wanted back.  I can't believe production  companies would even consider coming out with a special edition, director's  cut of this film.  If you have not seen this film, and have heard all of  the talk about how good it is, please be my guest and watch it, and form  your own opinion.  Hopefully you will feel the same way I do, and be really  bitter about the time you wasted watching the movie.  If not, then i'm  wondering what is happening to the world.  This is definitely a &quot;CULT  classic&quot; among people who enjoy B-movies.
B000002SYG|5.0|I can't get enough of him.  Can anyone say his lyrics and tunes aren't  mesmerizing?  No musical genius has matched him since.  First they framed  him, and then they went after Michael.  But we know he's the best!!!!  He's  just toooo much.  I spend my nights just staring at my posters on the wall  and listening to the Boy Wonder.  Go boy, go!  What a wonder?!
0783226063|5.0|After watching the film a thousand times you truly begin to see the epic scope that is Dune and we must approach it as such.
0805017305|5.0|i have just finished this book and i think it will take me a long time to  get it out of my mind.  i found this book sad and at times had to put it  down just to clear my head.  i feel ahamed to be white and as i live in  england i was ignorant to the terrible sufferings of the &quot;red  indian&quot;.  <br />i feel compelled to read more and wish to learn as much  as possible about this noble, honest, kind race.<br />if i could swap places  with a &quot;red indian&quot; i would be proud to do so.<br />may you weep no  more.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 isn't really a critique about war or about the military in specific.  It's an allegorical critique of Capitalism and the whole Western  system.  In the twilight of socialism that has descended since the fall of  Communism, the book's critique seems unduly harsh, but the warning message  is worth remembering.<br />What is &quot;Catch-22?&quot;  There are at least a  dozen examples in the book, and seem very difffernt.  What they have in  common is that each one is really saying &quot;the rules of the system  prevent reform of the system.&quot;  Examples include &quot;you can only  enter the Major's office when he isn't in it,&quot; and &quot;you can get  out of the war if you're crazy, but if you ASK, it proves you're not  crazy.&quot;<br />Milo, the arch Capitalist, is in many ways the worst  villain in the book.  Milo traffics with the enemy, steals medical supplies  (leaving his worthless IOU), and even contracts to bomb his own side.  The  corruption of Milo's money reaches far up the chain of command, and many of  the worst absurdities are tracable to Milo's schemes.<br />The only way around  the system is to break the rules -- to overthrow it.  The new recruits who  throw out the personal effects of the dead man in Yossarian's tent show how  in a small way; Orr demonstrates it in a large way, and the fact that Orr  ends up in Sweden points to socialism as a solution to the problems of the  capitalist world.<br />Obviously, in today's world, the example of Sweden  doesn't look so appealing, and the Capitalist West has shown substantial  ability to reform itself inside its own rules.  Still, the book is a great  read, and the lesson is worth learning, if only as an example of what we  have avoided -- and need to continue to avoid.
0671042858|4.0|I used to read a lot of Stephen King's novels. In fact, &quot;The Stand&quot; remains my favorite novel of all time. But I quit reading him  in 1993 after I read &quot;Gerald's Game&quot;- too gross and scary for me.  I felt forced to finish it against my will because when I stopped I kept  having horrible imaginings and dreams about how it would end. I feared my  imaginings might be worse than the book's own ending so I begrudgingly and  fearfully finished it, but I swore that I would not read anymore King. I  turned to the less frightening (and often less interesting) &quot;literary  fiction&quot; section of the bookstore and have been happily buried there  for much of the last 7 years. Then I unexpectedly caught site of this  little book at the check-out aisle at the grocery (a place where I had  never previously purchased a book). Hit with a burst of nostalgia for my  previous fondness for the author of my favorite book, I tossed it on the  counter. I read this book in a single night and yes, I was scared. But, I  remembered that I like that!  Also, my years away made me realize what a  fantastic writer he truly is. His characters and stories are the best of  the best. Since then I've been making up for lost time, reading (and  listening to and downloading) all the Stephen King I can find.  Long Live  the King!
B000006FNX|4.0|Enough with the crappy Roger Moore, the REAL James Bond is back in this 1983 Bond release.

Add  this to your James Bond collection today!
630588255X|5.0|Harold and Maude is just a delight to see.  Somehow, the wonderful acting of Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort seem to get away with their relationship (which  at the time, was QUITE a scandal!)<br />What is so great about this show is  that it was written so beautifully and sensitively.  I don't know of any  other movie that talks about life and death in such a sensitive, but yet  lighthearted manner.<br />My favorite scene is when Harold and Maude are in a  daisy field and Maude says:  &quot;You know Harold, I'd like to come back  as a sunflower most of all.  They're so big and hearty.  What would you  like to come back as?&quot;  Harold responds by saying &quot;One of  these&quot; (meaning one of the daisies).  Maude says &quot;How come&quot;  and he replies, &quot;Because they're all alike.&quot; <br />Then comes the  Kleenex box when she replies  &quot;Oh no, Harold, They're not all alike!   You see, some grow to the left, some to the right, some have even lost  petals, all SORTS of observer able differences . . .  You see, Harold, I  feel that much of the world's sadness comes from someone who is this&quot;  (she picks a daisy from the field) -- &quot;but yet ALLOWS themselves to be  treated as that&quot; (gesturing to the entire field of daisies).<br />You  can't beat this show for its marvelous acting by Ruth Gordon, especially.   You will also never find another movie that can portray all of these  intense subjects in such a carefree way that they seem commonplace.<br />Get  this movie and watch it several times to really enjoy it.  I've seen it at  least 30 times, myself and have enjoyed it more and more each time.
0812580346|3.0|The action in this book starts fast; in fact, the main idea of the story occurs on page 5.  The appealing part of the novel is the philosophical  consequences of people seeing three minutes of their life 20 years in the  future.  I thoroughly enjoyed the 'news items' at the beginnings of the  chapters.  <br />My problem with the novel is that most of the main characters  are either unlikeable or unremarkable.  I especially found the Theo  character loathesome; I was rooting for the villain to kill him at the end.   The main character was harmless enough, but his finance was annoying.  The  only intriguing character was the 'geeky' scientist who courts the woman  who he saw in his vision of the future (making love in their lab, no  less).<br />The dialogue in this book was somewhat stilted, but it didn't  bother me as much as the characters.
0780631153|5.0|Tragic.  Hopeful. Frightening.  Optimistic.  Brilliant!  The movie starts with a simple seeming apologia of &quot;coincidence&quot; and the ultimate  willing suspeension of disbelief that movie viewers are asked to apply each  time they sit down to ingest a film.  The thoughts and sentiments that  Anderson wishes to convey with this sweeping opus take some time to  develop.  This outstanding movie has some dragging moments at the start,  but make certain to watch carefully!   Virtually every detail is critical  to piecing together the entire story.  In fact, you must view the movie at  least three or four times to fully appreciate this young master's complex  work.<br />The casting is flawless with the exception of Cruise.  His  portrayal of Mackey is too over the top and his &quot;star&quot; image is  distracting;  however, the balance of the cast captivates.<br />Mr. Anderson  has graduated from the fluff of &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; to the pith of  &quot;Magnolia&quot;.  True movie afficionados wait for his next movie with  enthusiastic anticipation.  Will he outdo Tarantino (i.e., build to a  &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;-like crescendo) or will he slide down hill like Ed  Burns?  Hopefully, the former rather than the latter!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is brutaly violent, disturbing, gross, and one hell of a movie. I can't say I was much of a fan of Brad Pitt, but he shines here. As does  Edward Norton. Helena Bonham Carter, who made some really boring Merchant  Ivory movies in the past, holds her won with Pitt &amp; Norton. And unlike  the so called &quot;surprise&quot; in The Sixth Sense, Fight Club pulls off  a surprise that knocked me for a loop. This movie kicks some major ass.
B0000024ZC|5.0|I am only starting to get into Gentle Giant, having heard only this album  and Octopus thus far, but i must say, start to finish, this album is  flawless.<br />Prologue has a fantastic intro, which leads onto an excellent  song, containing all the things i love so much about Gentle Giant, the  tremendous vocals, great bass lines etc. etc.<br />Next up is Schooldays,  which i find a very haunting little track. It starts of quirky enough, but  soon you will see what i mean.<br />Working all Day is very different from the  other tracks on this album, but no less brilliant. Gentle Giant's bass work  is probably my favourite aspect of the band, and this song contains my  favourite bass playing on the album.<br />Peel the Paint is the most rocking  song on the album, with excellent guitar work that really drives this song.  The solo that kicks in at roughly 4:10 will blow you away.<br />Mister Class  and Quality is the track that i find the most catchy on the album. The way  that this track blends into track 6, Three Friends is a definite highlite  on the album.<br />Lastly, Three Friends, which is more of a extension of  Mister Class and Quality, is perhaps the most beautiful track on the album,  with some of the best vocal harmonies i have ever heard.<br />I highly  recommend this album to anyone who likes their music complex and beautiful.  It is progressive rock at its best.
B00000DHR0|4.0|I think that sexy Andrea Bocelli rules. Anyway, Cline was damn lucky enough to land a duet with him back in 1998. She and Andrea have often been  dissed by critics for their class, probably saying yeah right they can't  sing. Wrong. They can. As for the song \\"The Prayer,\\" you think you can't  cry? I did. Hard. Not like the rebash of \\"Con Te Partir,\\" retitled \\"Time  To Say Goodbye,\\" wherein her majesty Sarah Brightman be singing in unison  with Andrea and no harmony at all. No wonder \\"The Prayer\\" must be Andrea's  sexiest duo. END.
B00003ZA0T|4.0|I had the privelage of seeing Slipknot on the Ozzfest tour before their  album came out. They were the most incredible live band i had ever seen.  When their album Slipknot came out i was among the first to get it. I had  expected their album to not live up to their live show. I was thoroughly  impressed when the album captured slipknot's live show. The album starts  strong. wait and bleed, sic, purity, and no life are my personal favorites  though the album as a whole is solid. A  must have for any new metal fans.  they are in the same genre as korn, limp bizkit, coal chamber, etc. but  they sound nothing like them yet some similarities are their. Slipknot is  the band that will bring REAL heavy music to the mainstream, not korn or  limp bizkit. this album is a must have.
B00000J2SP|4.0|There is only one reason to get this album, and that's \\"Difficult to  Cure,\\" the last track, which is Blackmore and Company doing  Beethoven's 9th. I thought Zubin Mehta did a great job with this, but, take  my word, Beethoven was never this much fun. This album is for die-hard  Blackmore fans. Most of the album is pretty insipid, so don't expect  classic Deep Purple or Rainbow Rising. Get it to hear Beethoven's 9th.One  of the best heavy metal instrumentals ever. Too bad it's on such a dog of  an album.
B00004XMTC|3.0|This movie I found to be surprisingly similar to Thunderball, another Connery bond film.  One downside to this one is that all of the cast except  for Bond is played by a different person (like Q, blofeld, Moneypenny, M).   As a big bond fan, I found this pretty disopointing.  I did, however, find  it surprisingly funny that the person who played Mr. Bean played a role in  this movie.  The special effects are not great, like in all movies.  My  favorite scene had to involve the Domination game that shocks you as it  progresses.  For those of you that have seen this, you know what I mean.   This movie is not a classic bond film.  It is basically forgotten.  It  doesn't even have the moving dot and bond shooting it at the beginning, or  credits with the theme song while showing women and guns.  If you want just  the classics, go with Thunderball and all the others.  If you want  something thats a little different or want the &quot;entire&quot;  collection, buy this also.
B00000DLV1|5.0|Impressive is the first word that ocurrs to me now that i'm sitting in  front of my pc writing a review for this album, trying to describe it.  Beautyfull just might be the second.<br />Listen to the whole album and you  won't help but being amazed at the enourmous quality of these young british  musicians. When one listens to their studio albums (both excelent by the  way) the idea of them performing their songs live as good as they  originally recorded them seems very improbable. The complexity of the songs  seem impossible to accurately reproduce them before a live audience.  However, Portishead demonstrates that such notion couldn't be farther from  the true. In short: they perform extremely well in concert. In fact, some  of their songs actually sound better live, mainly because of the intense  vocals by Beth Gibbons. <br />The performance by the band is almost flawless,  and the string arrangements sound fantastic. The essence of the Portishead  albums remains even in concert: dense, moody, hipnotic, whatever you want  to call it.  &quot;Glory box&quot; is hipnotic as ever and the performance  is excelent. &quot;Sour times&quot; is probably the song that is most  modified, but the version is splendid also: a bit darker, a bit heavier, a  bit more powerfull, and Gibbon's really puts her heart and soul into the  song. Every times she screams &quot;'cause nobody loves me, not like you  do&quot; i get the chills. &quot;Half a day closing&quot; is also one of  the best songs in the album, as well as the powerfull &quot;All mine&quot;.  However, at least for my taste, the real gem of the album comes almost at  the end, with the fantastic interpretation of &quot;Roads&quot;. The song  is not one of my favourites on the &quot;Dummy&quot; album, but the song  really comes alive in this album. The emotion that Gibbons puts in this  song is almost unbearable. Put the song in your stereo with maximum volume,  close the doors in your room, put out the lights,close your eyes and you  will be truly transported into anohter dimension. <br />True:it's very odd  that such a young band already releases a live album. But when you listen  to it, you just gotta be grateful that they did. The album's fantastic, and  i dare say it's one of the best live recordings of the past decade. Really,  it's very highly recomendable.
6305013578|1.0|The other reviewers are correct about this, the movie is good, but the Madacy DVD sold here for under $10 is terrible. You can tell it's been  transferred from video, because there is a horizontal dropout-discoloration  in the first 10 minutes! It's a shame there are no good versions out, as  far as I can tell, and although I haven't seen the &quot;rock n' roll&quot;  version, I would want an edition with original musical score (if possible).  Don't buy this disc. Maybe there exists a better VHS version, but the one  sold here is apparently pretty bad also.
B00000I9MK|5.0|I mean, just look at the cover! Belle and Sebastian have this fantastic  way of mixing whimsical beauty and wry melancholy. It's a great album,  overall very optimistic and upbeat.
B0000024UX|5.0|How many albums can you say that about? With &quot;Bridge Over Troubled  Water,&quot; it's not hyperbole to state that every song is memorable and  marvelous. This is Simon and Garfunkel's last album and possibly their  greatest. Simon introduced horns and brass arrangements when previoulsy  they had been an acoustic duo.<br />Though casual listeners only know the  title track on this album, there is an amazing amount of brilliant music on  this disc. This is virtual perfection from Paul Simon and every song is a  genuine classic. What's interesting is that the hit songs from this disc  (the incomparable title track and &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot;) are probably  not as good as some of the sleepers. Listen to the simple poetic beauty of  &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; and the driving  &quot;Baby  Driver.&quot;  An innovative touch in the latter song is the faux-race car  announcer talking at the tail end of the song. Another incredibly catchy  tune is &quot;Keep the Customer's Satisfied,&quot; which never got any  airplay but which is quirky and memorable.<br />But the outstanding song here  is the &quot;Boxer,&quot; containing arguably the greatest lyrics of any  song written by anyone in the Rock generation. Just read the lyrics on the  album sleeve... they are poetry! &quot;The Boxer&quot; shows eloquently  that Paul Simon is unmatched as a lyricist, nothing Dylan or Lennon and  McCartney (not even &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;) can compete with the poetic  majesty of this man. Listen to this record and find out for yourself or  confirm what you already knew. A magnificent album!
0553270435|1.0|I thought this would be an empowering book that would teach me.  It turned  out to use a lot of common sence that would be helpful if everyone didn't  know it already.  Then there's also some crazy stuff - for example, you can  heal someone accross the country - using your subcontious mind.
B0000024SN|5.0|Admittedly, this is one of Simon and Garfunkel's more dated albums. Though  Simon is a brilliant lyricist, some of his couplets here fall a bit flat  and sound Sophomoric today. Still, there is no one writing today who came  close to his brilliance, even at the incipient stages of his career, as  demonstrated here. &quot;Kathy's Song&quot; remains one of his most magical  set of words (&quot;My mind's distracted and diffused&quot;) and &quot;A  Most Peculiar Man&quot; sounds a bit dated, but who cares? It's still a  wonderful and quirky song.<br />If you are new to S &amp; G, I would opt for  &quot;Bookends&quot; or &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; before you  buy this album. It's not in the same league as their other offerings, but  it's still a solid album which shows the emerging genius of Paul Simon.
B00004U2HK|5.0|This is the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!  And that's the truth!  I love anything with Julie Andrews in it!
B0000024TQ|5.0|Though casual listeners regard this merely as &quot;the Mrs. Robinson  album,&quot; that is a vast understatement considering the amount of  brilliant music on this disc. This is virtual perfection from Paul Simon  and every song (except &quot;Voices from Old People&quot;) is a genuine  classic.<br />Paul Simon is one of the greatest lyricists of the last fifty  years, in any musical genre. His words are sheer poetry and this art is  exemplified on this magnificent album. Some people curiously dismiss Simon  and Garfunkel as &quot;passe&quot; or &quot;dated,&quot; but they obviously  haven't listened to this record.<br />What's interesting is that the hit songs  from this disc (the incomparable &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; and  &quot;America&quot;) are probably not as good as some of the sleepers.  Listen to the simple poetic beauty of &quot;The Bookends Theme&quot; and  the driving  &quot;Fakin' It.&quot;  An innovative touch in the latter song  is the British-accented, &quot;G' Morning, Mr. Leach, have you had a busy  day?&quot; Another incredibly catchy tune is &quot;Punky's Dilemma,&quot;  which never got any airplay but which is quirky and memorable.<br />There's  just so much brilliant music here, this is one of the great albums of the  60's. Paul Simon is unmatched as a lyricist, nothing Dylan or Lennon and  McCartney (not even &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;) can compete with the poetic  majesty of this man. Listen to this record and find out for yourself or  confirm what you already knew. A timeless album!
B00004SCX6|2.0|Not that I cannot appreciate pop music - in fact I rather find Lucky and Oops - I did it again rather infectious with Britney Spears manipulating  her vocals to the mechanical line of previous hits like You Drive Me Crazy.  In this album, it proves a grave disappointment with the rather superficial  lyrics and lack of stretch of her range. &quot;I can get no  satisfaction&quot;, &quot;What u see is what u get&quot; - provocative  titles but shallow insights. The only other song that I find good is  &quot;Dear Diary&quot; - Britney has that innate talent to entrench herself  in the pop-arena - but with monotonous and formulaic approaches - it won't  get her very far. We will appreciate more daring stunts instead of feeding  us easy fodders by Max Martin. Maybe the next album will have fans calling  out &quot;Oops- she already did that.&quot;
6300246876|5.0|The movie ia a truly remarkable work. It allows us to see the viewpoints of both the Americans and Japanese with a high degree of historical  accuracy. Its good to see all the military blunders and various levels of  incompentence by both politicians and military officials in the film. I say  this because in a number of World War II films we are only allowed to see  the Axis powers behave like bumbling idiots. The film would be a great  addition to any video library and teachers would find it useful to show to  their students.

B000002X1O|3.0|The remastered version of Baron von Tollbooth &amp; The Chrome Nun  undoubtedly contains some exceptional songs (check out Ballad of the Chrome  Nun, Fat, and the indomitable Across the Board). The material is very good,  but listening is made difficult by the poor sound quality.  Grace Slick's  voice is obscured by the music, which in turn is obscured by the overall  sound quality.  Kinda sounds like listening to music at the end of a very  long tunnel, very dim sounding (the term &quot;remastered&quot; is lost on  this album).  I still can't distinguish some of the lyrics to Ballad of the  Chrome Nun, although I get the overall jist of it.  This is a must if  you're a Grace Slick/Jefferson Airplane fan, but if you're just a casual  listener, don't bother, unless you like the tunnel effect.  Buy it for the  artistic vision and the witty lyrical content, not for the sound quality.

B00000K3D4|5.0|&quot;Jareth: You remind me of the babe. Goblin: What babe? Jareth: The babe with the power. Different Goblin: What power? Jareth: The power of  voodoo. Goblin: Who do? Jareth: You do. Goblin: Do what? Jareth: Remind me  of the babe.&quot;<br />When I first saw this film as a kid, it was intant  love.   Jim Henson, George Lucas and David Bowie take you into a dazzling  world of fantasy and adventure, &quot;where everything seems possible and  nothing is what it seems.&quot;  <br />LABYRINTH, is almost completely  dominated by creations from Jim Henson's Creature Shop, though it does  contains a human or two (David Bowie as Jareth, the Goblin King, and  Jennifer Connelly as our modern-day Alice in Wonderland, Sarah).  Like many  teenagers, Sarah prefers the world of fairytales and make-believe to  reality.  Saddled with the &quot;unfairness&quot; of having to baby-sit her  infant brother, she defiantly wishes that &quot;the goblins would take him  away.&quot;    Little does she know, the Goblin King  really does exist and  he immediately comes to claim his prize. When Sarah tells him it was all a  mistake and she'd like her brother back, he sets her a task: she can get  the child back, but only by finding her way through an endless labyrinth to  the castle in the center within thirteen hours. <br />And the labyrinth is  impressive indeed.   The illusionary world is a wonder to behold, full of   Escher-esque columns and archways, immaculate hedge walls, and a massive  city in the center of the maze surrounding the castle.  Doorways move  about, door knockers provide riddles, and traps ofall shapes and sizes  abound waiting to... well.... trap you.  <br />Director Jim Henson balances  the deliberate rhythms with the intricate and impressive special effects of  the time, to create a spellbinding film.    LABYRINTH seems to be inspired  by the works of Maurice Sendak and Louis Carroll as is evident by the  flawless concept design by artist Brian Froud.  Ex Monty Pythonmember  Terry Jones has written a script full of sly wonder and mischievous  marvels.  And David Bowie also performs five mystical, magical songs for  the film. <br />Not many extras on the DVD but there is an excellent  documentary, &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot; featuring tons of behind the  scenes footage showing the creation of this incredible looking  film.<br />Bottom Line:  a must for Jim Henson enthusiasts and anyone who  likes intelligent fantasy.

B00000JPH6|5.0|Filmed entirely using puppets from the late Jim Henson's own workshop, the movie is steeped in fantastical lore in which no human appears.  It centers  around a young Gelfling named Jen, who believes he is the last of his kind.    He soon discovers he is not alone when he meets another Gelfling named  Kira who has been hidden away.  In the process he learns that he is the one  prophesized to save his planet by restoring a mystical crystal to its  original state before the aligning of planets brings about the rule of the  Skeksis (vulture-like feral creatures who have no qualms about destroying  one another to stay in power.)  So begins his quest to search for the  legendary Dark Crystal.<br />The late Jim Henson (along with his now famous  Creature Shop) created a mythical visual masterpiece, helped along by Brian  Froud's breathtaking conceptual designs.  <br />This DVD re-release is  presented in Widescreen anamorphic format and features such treats as  character drawings, two deleted scenes, and a wonderful Documentary: The  World Of The Dark Crystal filled with interviews and trivia (did you know  that Jim Henson orginally created an entire language for the series but  abandoned the concept believing that children would not want to read  subtitles.)<br />A neccessary edition to your DVD collection, especialy for  Henson fans.

0192834290|5.0|\\"The Woman In White\\" is either the best mystery by this Author, or some readers like myself would choose \\"The Moonstone\\". I read the latter first,  and the first introduction often remains a favorite. These are also his  most well known works, although as an Author and playwright he produced  dozens. Rarely is a book received with such a unity of opinion, the 31  reviewers that precede me gave an average of a perfect 5 stars. And this  praise is for a book that is now being published in its third  century.<br />The book is intricate; it has the reader view the same events  from many points of view of a variety of characters, in either written or  spoken form. From the first encounter with the lady in white, to the final  step out of Mr. Collins's maze, into the open space of  \\"seeing\\" all the  bits he has presented you with, the book is uniformly excellent. One  commercial review suggested the book improved by being abridged, but they  can be dismissed, as that is what they are selling on tape. Mr. Collins was  a writer not a recording Artist, and even those who listen to the audio  version have done nothing to deserve being given an interpretation of the  novel. His writing has survived and flourished while countless means of  communication conveyance have come and gone.<br />Mr. Collins constructs  intricate plots, to share them, allow them to develop, and then to unwind  the mystery takes time, or perhaps pages. This book and others were issued  to the public in stages over several months. Even when they were bound for  library use, they were bound in 3 separate bindings. All of this was taken  into account when the writing was done, to suggest there can be any  modification of the work is to advertise ignorance. To suggest an  abridgement is not only possible but also an improvement is  imbecilic.<br />Mr. Wilkie Collins, his friend Mr. Charles Dickens, and their  contemporaries wrote books, They were as long as they needed to be, for  their Authors or Authoresses were not pondering what the movie rights might  bring, or how to adapt a particular character to suit a given actor. The  writing they did was uncorrupted. It is true, especially with Mr. Dickens  that he read from his work for the public, and did so extensively. But to  compare a live reading by the creator of a work, to another mechanical  abridged format is absurd.<br />\\"The Woman In White\\" would probably not be  published for the first time today. How many books of this length do you  find yourself inundated with from today's Authors? Of course there are  excellent writers today, a handful can be brilliant in one third the space  of this book, but so what? Well one problem is that for Charles Palliser to  create one of his works takes years, and the results are magnificent, but  like others who will remain in print ad infinitum, his work is long. His  work has also been compared to that of Mr. Collins.<br />In the end Readers  decide what is to stay and what is to be forgotten. It is wonderful that  while more and more of what is offered presently are ready-made  screenplays, or bound thoughts with the depth of a parking lot puddle, we  still have these gems handed down to us whose quality has ensured their  permanence.<br />If mystery is what you like, this is the Author who started  it.

B000003TAW|5.0|I had remembered Weezer from my days in middle school, and I had liked  singles like &quot;Undone&quot; and &quot;Buddy Holly.&quot; However, those  songs got played a little too much, and I passed on this album. I became  interested in Weezer once again when I saw some of their Warped Tour  performances on TV. Then when I went to a friend's party, Weezer's  self-titled CD started to play, and I loved it. I ran out and bought the CD  the next day. <br />I can't believe I had been missing out on such a great  album. Weezer's debut is a great summer album and a great feel-good release  too. The lyrics are funny, but not in a tasteless or stupid way. For  everybody having a down day or feeling rejected, this CD should make them  feel better. So many good songs are on here including &quot;My Name Is  Jonas,&quot; &quot;In The Garage,&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;The  World Has Turned And Left Me Here.&quot;<br />Some people have criticized  Weezer for being &quot;geeky&quot; and having lyrics that aren't too  serious, but that's what makes them so special. These guys are being  themselves, and nobody is serious all the time. Weezer were brave enough to  go against the cliched angry grunge sounds of the time and just wanted to  have some fun. And their music works. Don't miss out for so long like I  did. Buy this album right now!

6305892946|5.0|At first, I thought that this movie would not be taut and original as the others.  When I watched it, I was surprised.  The movie contained all the elements of a good sequel.  It contained the traditional high body count,  suspense, and and black humor.  <br />     The story is about Sidney Prescott,  who now goes by another name.  Her life is okay, but someone begins to  stalk her once again in a deadly game of cat and mouse.  Meanwhile, a movie  called Stab 3 is in production.  Before the movie is finished, a murderer  begins to stalk the ones involved in the movie one by one.  With each  victim, the killer leaves behind a clue. <br />     Gale Wethers, who is now a  major celebrity, teams with Dewwy to catch the cunning killer.  As they get  closer and closer to the truth, they realize that Sidney has a connection  to the carnage, and she may be the next victim.<br />     With a twist or turn  at every corner, the movie is guaranteed to leave you on the edge of your  seat.  It may have a high body count, but there is very little gore  involved in the deaths.  It is loaded with action and heart pounding chases  between predator and prey.  The cast gives a wonderful performance and the  script is well written.  Humor is placed in the right places and so is the  violence.  You would keep your eyes glued to the television screen until  the shocking climax.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes  suspenseful sequels.
B00004UFYU|5.0|El nuevo trabajo de &quot;Era&quot; merece ser recomendado. Tal vez menos  solemne que el primer album, los temas son mas ritmicos (o mas  &quot;bailables&quot;, por que no?), como puede verse en  &quot;Infanati&quot; o &quot;Sentence&quot;, por ejemplo. Se destacan  &quot;Omen Sore&quot;, que transmite una atmosfera plena de paz, con una  armonia vocal sin precedentes. &quot;Hymne&quot; es tambien una de mis  favoritas. Tal vez, este album pueda llegar a ser superior al primero...
B00003CXHJ|1.0|I was wondering why I was the only person in the cinema when I saw this movie. By the end of the 2 hours, I realized why no-one else had come to  see it. It is simply because it is dumb. Flat-out dumb. The script is weak  and needed improving, the acting is terrible and disappointing because it  had such a good cast, and the director...well, lets not go there. On the  other hand, U-571 had awesome sound, great special effects and good  editing, but I suppose those aren't really the important things, are they?  I do not recommend this movie at all.

B00003CXFU|4.0|I love real life exposes and documentaries about determined upright people with spunk and zeal never giving up and getting justice...I'm thinking Cher  and Sally Field and, more recently Russell Crowe--it's really a classic all  American genre.  This movie, starring the excellent actress Julia Roberts,  looking incredibly sluttish in a cheery sort of way, and the old war horse  Albert Finney as her jaded lawyer boss, is about as typical of this good  guy-bad guy style of movie as it gets.  The trouble is, it's a little too  long and the secondary plot about Erin's personal life is just really  poorly handled.  I don't know who the actor was who played her boyfriend  but he was a sexy as a wet washcloth and I was glad, yes GLAD, when he  wasn't in the scene.<br />Julia Roberts continues to astound me however...my  husband  adores her and still I can't be jealous.  There is something  natural and ingenuous about her that makes her performances in every movie  stand out.<br />The chemistry between her and Albert Finney and between her  and the troubled people of the town of Hinkley was a beautiful sight to  see.  Watch this movie for her performance alone.

B0000025DT|4.0|&quot;A New World Record&quot; is the best and most consistent of the  band's original studio albums because it contains the greatest number of  good songs combined with the fewest number of clunkers.

The best somgs, &quot;Tuesday Afternoon,&quot;  and &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; are perfect late 60s period pieces.  Some of the other songs, however, have not aged nearly as well.  What  really mars the album are the unbelievably pretentious &quot;poetry&quot;  that opens and closes the album.  They might have been prophetic during a  spaced out Summer of Love acid trip, but they are perfectly ridiculous  today.  Overall, you're better off with a Moody Blues anthology album.

Most of the songs are singable, if you like singing along  with music. I predict that at least 3 to 5 of the songs on this CD will hit  the top 40's.
B000002GQJ|2.0|This is a typical late 60s Moody Blues album.  Take a couple of good  songs, in this case &quot;The Question&quot; and &quot;And the Tide Rushes  In,&quot; and surround them with a bunch of super pretentious filler  material.  You're better off with a Moody Blues anthology album.
B000002OX7|5.0|&quot;Who's Next&quot; was released in 1971. This album is very different  from the Who's work on the compilation &quot;Meaty Beaty Big and  Bouncy.&quot; &quot;Who's Next&quot; is a more mature album, but it still  contains all of the energy and intensity of the Who's earlier work. It's  hard for me to say which of those two albums is better. However, it is  clear to me that both of them are an essential part of any rock and roll  collection. Both are among my 25 favorite albums of all time.<br />&quot;Who's  Next&quot; is a perfect album. Every song is excellent.  I think that this  album sounds so different from the Who's earlier work that it almost sounds  as if they are a different band. But that just shows that the band was able  to come up with new concepts, ideas, song structures, and melodies. It  doesn't mean that they became better, and it doesn't mean that they became  worse. Really, I think that in order to understand the Who, you need to  have &quot;Who's Next&quot; and &quot;Meaty Beaty Big and  Bouncy.&quot;<br />Pete Townsend was one of the two greatest synthesizer  artists of the 1970s (the other being Stevie Wonder). The synth work on  &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; is perhaps the best use of the machine  that has ever been used in the history of rock. The way the synth pulls and  tugs, and changes in pitch and volume, it almost sounds as if it was a  living thing.<br />&quot;Bargain&quot; is one of the greatest love songs ever  written. I guess in 1971 a lot of people must have been pretty surprised to  hear the Who writing a song about love. But don't think the song is wimpy.  This song has just as much intensity as anything else that they have ever  done. Physically, the song is somewhat mellow compared to their other  songs, but the intensity of the feelings that are present is just as strong  and intense as anything else that they have ever done. When this guy tells  the girl that he is in love with her, he sounds totally  believable.<br/>&quot;My Wife&quot; is, admittedly, somewhat sexist in  nature, but only a politically correct wacko would find it offensive. Heh  heh. Gotta watch out for those psycho women that go after you. Perhaps the  song was intended as a joke? I don't know.<br />&quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; is a  song about the feelings of youth and anger and alienation and depression,  and about how sometimes it feels as if you are all alone and nobody  understands you. This is a great song, full of understanding and  compassion. Some people say that rock music has a bad influence on  teenagers, but the way I see it, teenagers need to hear this song. This  song lets you know that you are not the only one who feels the way that you  do. Who knows, maybe hearing this song could be enough to encourage a  suicidal teenager to change his mind?<br />A lot of the songs on this album go  against the conventional, 3 minute song structure that was common at the  time. This helps to give added dimension and personality to the songs.  &quot;Who's Next&quot; is one of the best examples that I can think of of  the idea of an album being a concept. Each individual song is excellent,  but the album as a whole may very well be better than the sum of its  individual parts.<br />&quot;Who's Next&quot; is a a great album. But don't be  one of those people who buys only this. Get &quot;Who's Next,&quot; but  also get &quot;Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy.&quot; In order to really  understand what the Who was about, you need to have both of those albums.
B0000025DV|3.0|Originally a double album, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; might have been  ELO's masterpiece had it been edited down to one.  As it is, there are a  number of great songs that are hampered only by being surrounded with a lot  of filler material.  The best of the lot are &quot;Sweet Talkin'  Woman,&quot; &quot;Its Over,&quot; &quot;Sweet is the Night,&quot;  &quot;Birmingham Blues,&quot; &quot;Turn to Stone&quot; and &quot;Night in  the City.&quot;  &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot; was also a big hit, but can be  annoying with repeated listenings.  Give ELO leader Jeff Lynne credit for  being ambitious, but with &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; he just went a bit  too far.
B0000067L2|5.0|For a lot of people, their first Cream purchase is whichever greatest hits  CD happens to be in print at the time. In my opinion, that's a bad idea,  because &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; is so much better than any greatest hits  CD of Cream's music that could ever be made. When I was in high school 15  years ago, I owned every Cream album, and &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; has  always been my favorite Cream album. Some people call it a  &quot;psychedelic album,&quot; but to me, that is only a minor part of it.  To me, this is primarily a blend of rock, pop, and blues. Cream has a very  unique, distinctive sound. I don't really think that I have a favorite song  here. All of them are so good. I just like to listen to the disc in its  entirety, from start to finish.<br />I love the way Ginger Baker plays the  drums. At first impression, you might think that he's an amateur who  doesn't know what he's doing. But upon closer examination, you realize that  he is an extremely talented, highly skilled professional. The way that he  plays the drums, it sounds almost as if he was just playing for fun, and  had no idea that he was being recorded. His attitude seems so care free and  relaxed. The drum playing itself is powerful and energetic, but his  attitude seems relaxed. I bet he must have had a lot of fun working on this  album!<br />Jack Bruce is a very powerful bass player. When you only have  three musicians, all of them must be strong at doing their part. Bruce's  bass playing helps to give a full sound to the band. And the way he sings,  he sounds just like a regular guy. He doesn't sound like a professional  singer at all. It's like he's just there to have fun! And that works great  for this album.<br />And then there's Eric Clapton. With the possible  exception of the &quot;Layla and other Assorted Love Songs&quot; album,  Clapton's best work was certainly with Cream. By the time that  &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; was recorded, Clapton had already had so much  experienceplaying the guitar that his playing here sounds just as skilled  as the other musicians. Clapton has enough confidence in his abilities that  he is able to have the same relaxed attitude that Baker and Bruce seem to  have.<br />All in all, Baker, Bruce, and Clapton all sound as if they really  enjoyed themselves while making this album. This is a great CD. Don't take  it too seriously. Just sit down, and listen, and have an open mind, and  relax, and you should have a great time!
6304789440|5.0|This probably will stay the 80s best sci-fi movie along with The Terminator and The Abyss.My most favourite sceen is when the team is in the  ALIEN lair,and that they don't know where to  shoot and they get killed and  only 3 get out.Why didn't they make ALIEN 3 like that-It doesn't get to me.

B000022TTS|5.0|I anxiously awaited this movie's opening in the theaters because since I was in high school I have had a great interest in the horrible tragedy that  took place in the North Atlantic in April 1912.  Being very familiar with  the true story, I was afraid that when this movie came out I would be  seeing a 1997 version of the Poseidon Adventure.  I couldn't have been more  wrong.  First of all, I would like to thank the makers of this film for  going to the actual wreck of the Titanic and filming scenes of areas within  the wreck that hadn't been seen before.  The scenes early in the movie of  this great ship lying on the bottom of the ocean were heart wrenching.  Gloria Stuart was just beautiful as a survivor of the wreck who returned 85  years later to take care of some unfinished business.  The romance, which I  believe was included to basically hold the story together, was pretty much  according to formula and predictable, but you still grow to care about  these people and what happens to them.  But it is more important to  remember this--Jack and Rose were fictional characters who may or may not  have had experiences like those portrayed in the movie.  There were more  than 1500 real people who died when the Titanic sank.  This is especially  poignant in the scene in the movie where we look across the ocean and see  all of the dead, frozen in the icy cold water.  Only one lifeboat went back  to try to help anyone.  And they were too late.  The ending, when Rose  drops the necklace into the ocean, sending it back to the Titanic is a nice  finish.  And I think the treasure hunters/grave robbers in this movie have  learned something in the end.  Maybe more people will learn some day.  Lets  hope.
B000002J6H|5.0|I'm quite dissapointed with the first review in this section. You  Americans should be happy with musicans like Stills. I wish he was Dutch.  If Stephen Stills is not accomplished, who is..? I agree with the other  writers that he is the basis of CSN. This record is the best thing he ever  made (my personal favourite), which combines styles of music that are  sensational. From accoustic and electric blues, to gospel, to countryrock  etc. On this record, Stephen is amongst musicans that measure up to his  talent (Hendrix, Clapton). Unfortunately, he could not keep up this level  of performance. Strangely enough, he sounds reborn on CSN from 1977, but  again could not sustain this.
0785787135|5.0|I lent this book to a friend once, and he never returned it.  The fact  that a guy kept this book shows how good it is.  Some readers may be  troubled by the sheer mass of this masterpiece.  Don't be - it reads  incredibly fast.  The characters incredibly well-written, complex,  believeable, relateable, and three-dimensional.  It amazes me a little that  this book would be included in the young adults section, as I remember  trying to read it when I was a &quot;young adult&quot; and put it down  because of some of the adult situations.  Nevertheless, this is a powerful  story.<br />You will hear much about the God v. Goddess/patriarchy v.  matriarchy/women as chattle v. female equality themes that run through this  book.  In my mind, this is a story about tolerance, which is, sadly, a  lesson we still need to learn in this day and age.  I concur with every  other review I've read so far of this novel, that being YOU MUST READ THIS  BOOK.
0440178002|4.0|I read Shogun five years ago and I am currently reading it a second time.   It is a wonderful, exciding and very readable book.  I would give the book  5 stars if I was not frusterated with Clavell's manipulation of History.   Knowing a bit about Japanese feudal history makes it difficult to adjust to  the fictitious names, events, and cultural practices.<br />Aside from that  minor complaint, I would recommend Shogun to just about anyone.  I don't  doubt that I will be reading it a third time in a few more years.<br />If you  enjoy Shogun, you should try Taiko by Yoshikawa.  I would rate Taiko a 6  stars if possible.
B000002UAF|5.0|How could anyone say this isn't rock 'n' roll?  It's not show tunes or  classical from where I'm hearing.  Anyhoo, this album is wonderful.  The  only song I can truly criticize is &quot;When I Get Home&quot;.  Must have  been written later in the sessions, so it's not very inspired.  But  everything else is a gem.  &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;Any Time At  All&quot;, &quot;You Can't Do That&quot;, &quot;Things We Said Today&quot;,  and the title track I believe are the best tracks.  At least Lennon and  McCartney had a challenge to write all of the songs.  They did not and  still do not disappoint.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Beatles are rock. Prince is pop. Credeance Clearwater Revival was  bayou. Tupac was rap. Adam Sandler is comedy. Cake is a snake. Sprite is a  beverage. But...Pink Floyd IS Pink Floyd. There is no way to describe Pink  Floyd. It's the most powerful, amazing music there is. There is no one song  that Pink Floyd ever did that was bad, and that rarely happens. Every band  has to have that one bad seed...but sorry people...Pink Floyd doesn't have  one. Pink Floyd isn't for everyone. It's the most unique music ever.  &quot;The Wall&quot; is probably they're best, but then again, I can't say  that. Because with a best, there has to be a worst and there is no one bad  album they ever did. This isn't just a review for &quot;The Wall&quot;  (even though, let me tell you, it is amazing). This is a review for every  Pink Floyd album...so when describing Pink Floyd there really is now way to  describe them, except these two words...Pink Floyd. And that should do it.
0800109090|4.0|LEGENDS OF THE FALL is a movie that will appeal to both male and females alike.  It can not be labeled as a &quot;chick flick&quot; or a non-stop  action adventure either.  It is a combination of both.  Making it the  perfect movie to see with your significant other.<br />My wife loved the  romantic love story and, of course, Brad Pitt.  As a historian I enjoyed  the setting: the mid-west in the 1910s and World War I.  This move in fact  won the 1994 Academy Award for Best Cinematography.  We both found Anthony  Hopkins performance superb (as usual).<br />Without giving away the story the  movie shows the life of a family of three brothers and their father, the  brothers love for one woman, and the families struggles for survival.<br />See  this movie today with the one you love!
B000002UB3|5.0|Okay, first of all &quot;music fan from Houston&quot;....  How DARE you compare the Beatles to Rob Thomas.  Rob Thomas is a &quot;gone in five  seconds&quot; pop star who will be performing for weddings and sweet  sixteen parties in a few years.  The Beatles are sheer musical genius.  You  complained about the short length of two songs and made some preposterous  assumption that the Beatles could write riffs but not verses.  HELLO-- it's  an album.  Each song contributes to the whole.  &quot;The End&quot; is a  cullmination of the entire album.  Who cares if it is only 15 seconds?  If  you listen to such musical garbage as Rob Thomas, then you are used to an  album having one, maybe two good songs, rather than 17 tracks of glorious  musical bliss.  So, I guess I can't entirely blame you for not appreciating  an album that lives up to its classification of being an &quot;album&quot;,  rather than a 15 dollar piece of plastic that contains the latest radio  craze, along with 10-14 filler tracks that no one ever listens to. Don't  listen to the beatles if you are just going to criticize them... stick with  rob thomas, sugar ray, n'sync, smashmouth, backstreet boys, etc.
6302409365|5.0|I have alway's been a fan of The Addam's Family TV show of the 1960's  &amp; when the movie came out in 91 I thought it was just another lousey  re-make of an old TV classic. By time it came on video something inside me  was urging me to rent it. I did and it was worth every penny I spent, I  liked it so much I bought it when I took the movie back. <br />The cast gives  suberb performances especially Christina Ricci who, in my opinoin, stole  the show from the rest of the cast. Angelica Houston, Raul Julia, &amp;  Christopher Lloyd also gave outstanding performances. The story is quite  simple, Gomez (Julia) is still searching for his long lost brother Fester.  When a greedy woman &amp; her son get hold of the story &amp; hear about  the Addams' fortune she decides to dress her son up as Fester to get hold  of the family fortune. Some of the most funny parts are watching Wendsday  &amp; Pugsly &quot;play&quot; with their electric chairs &amp; butcher  knives. A MUST SEE!
B00000IQUT|1.0|\\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" may well be the kind of film that might be given a four star rating by people with sick minds.Last I checked,I'm the complete opposite.Sure,I love horror films.Horror films with good taste.After viewing this movie,there are no doubts in my mind that I should have had my head checked.I should have been locked up in a loony ward for buying this ... A young woman is raped a few times by a group of men who later get their just desserts.Everything in this film is really bad.The acting.The castration scene is one example of bad acting.My question is why did this girl just leave when they were harrasing her?This is not a horror movie.This is not a movie at all.I know a great horror film when I see one.I Spit on Your Grave may have been the kind of film I would have rush to rented on video fifteen years ago.Guess I smartened up.
B00003CXFG|5.0|The movie is a refreshing surprise in the current genre of sci-fi films.  I particularly liked the fact that the characters are realistic, in terms  of their flaws and strong points.  No one is purely evil or virtuous.   Vin  Diesel, aka, Richard B. Riddick stood out as the reluctant savior because  of his raw talent in portraying a &quot;Hannibal Lecter of the space  age.&quot;
B00001OH7V|5.0|One of David Bowie's most quotable quotes was him pronouncing the death of  rock &amp; roll, \\"I've rocked my last roll\\". Maybe so, but to a certain  extent Bowie has put the \\"rock\\" back in \\"rock &amp; roll\\". And for a great  deal of the songs on \\"HEROES\\", he has done just that. The whole concept of  the BERLIN trilogy and working with Brian Eno had once again rejuvenated  Bowie just as it seemed he'd fallen into another creative hole. LOW was  certainly the most out-there of the trilogy, and maybe of any of Bowie's  albums, but \\"HEROES\\" has him slowly but surely returning to matters of the  heart. \\"Joe The Lion\\", which is supposed to be a tribute to Bowie's son is  anything but with its dirty guitar riffs and lyrics that would put any  decadent rock giant to shame. The rock remains evident on songs like  \\"Beauty &amp; The Beast\\" and \\"Blackout\\" which feature more emphasis on  guitar. Of course, the title track to this album is the song that's become  a Bowie anthem. For six minutes, Bowie echoes the sentiments of every  underdog in the world (including myself) into a heartwrenching, almost  bloodcurdling cry for recognition in a world full of anti-individuality.  The grungy guitars help make \\"Heroes\\" truly one of the rare recent songs of  Bowie's that hasn't dated a day since its inception. The instrumental  experiments of LOW are continued with the four instrumentals that bring  such foreign instruments as an out-of-tune saxophone &amp; the Japanese  koto into the rock genre (as evidenced on Asia's \\"Heat Of The Moment\\").  Even with the introduction of such odd musics, \\"HEROES\\" remains quite  organic, and that's how I think the album has earned its influence. It  proved David Bowie could still pursue his strange musical visions while  still remaining within the boundaries of rock &amp; roll.

B00001OH7Y|5.0|Combining the innovations of the BERLIN trilogy with the mostly embarrassing pop sounds of his `80s work, SCARY MONSTERS would be called a  transitional effort by most critics, but the time marking is incredibly  accurate. SCARY MONSTERS is widely considered to be David Bowie's last  great album before pulling out all the commercial stops and effectively  cutting himself off from being an innovator. In all honesty, it surely is.  Then again, SCARY MONSTERS has proven to be a hard album to top in the  first place. Somehow predating the often stiff synthesized pop sounds that  would define the rest of the decade, synthesizers are the focal point of  much of the album, making it more pop than rock. But at least it's pop that  won't rot your teeth. Bowie still uses his voice to its emotional best on  songs like \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" (stop calling this a \\"Heroes\\" rip-off),  \\"Scream Like A Baby\\", and \\"Because You're Young\\" (this probably is a  \\"Heroes\\" rip-off). SCARY MONSTERS also features what is probably Bowie's  last truly classic song, \\"Ashes To Ashes\\". A belated retirement of one of  Bowie's first musical characters, Major Tom, its creepily out-of-tune piano  and hypnotic ending chant helps make this one of his most unsettling songs.  Of course, it's unsettling to the point that you'll want to listen to it  over and over again. In fact, SCARY MONSTERS would be David Bowie's last  album of this kind for nearly two decades. From here on out, the top of the  charts was his destination.
079074841X|2.0|Stanley Kubrick's last release, &quot;Eye Wide Shut&quot; was a pathetic and misanthropic finish to one of the greatest careers in film making  history.  The only defense I can suggest is that perhaps had Kubrick lived  a bit longer, the film would have been dramatically improved.  Unfortunately, we are only able to judge the finished product that we see  before our very open eyes.  I have an incredible respect and  admiration  for Kubrick's past masterpieces.  &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; for  instance, is perhaps the defining film concerning the Vietnam tragedy.  &quot;Dr. Strangelove,&quot;&quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; and  &quot;The Shining,&quot; will remain among the finest movies of all time.  Every artist, however, has  their inevitable failures, and the giant,  Stanley Kubrick, is no exception.<br />&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is so  incredibly awful that I am convinced only someone as respected as Kubrick  could have gotten it produced.  A  budding screen director would have been  ridiculed.  The banality of the dialogue prompted me to feel sorry for the  actors  who did their best to give the script some credence. Even the  members of the Academy Awards Committee could not find an excuse to  give  the deceased director a prize in even the minor categories.  Publicly the  motion picture industry said all the appropriate things.  The  virtual  silence, however, during the awards ceremony spoke volumes of how they  actually valued &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot; One should also notice  that  the Amazon community reviewers have essentially ignored this movie. Is this  due to a subtle and tacit mindset that believes if you can't  say something  nice, you shouldn't say anything whatsoever?  The only saving grace of this  film is Kubrick's mind boggling ability of  photographing scenes.  My  breath is always taken away when observing the visual beauty of Kubrick's  artistry.  Could any other major  director do it better?  None comes to  mind.  Stanley Kubrick is significantly more skilled than even the talented  Steven Spielberg.  I  suspect that Kubrick was becoming very cynical and  bitter towards the end of his life.  &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; exudes a  misanthropic aura that  made the film difficult to watch.  The highly  publicized nudity was not in the least bit erotic.  The film's pervasive  coldness, subdued anger,  and unjustifiable length gave me the distinct  impression that Kubrick wanted us to suffer through this experience.  I  know little about  Kubrick's final years, but I doubt if he knew much joy  or existential satisfaction.  Chris Isaak's lyrics of &quot;Baby did a bad,  bad  thing&quot; is the signature song of this film.  It behooves me to  paraphrase Isaak and add &quot;Stanley Kubrick did a bad, bad thing.&quot;  Kubrick made  a film best forgotten and beneath his dignity.  Only hard  core Kubrick fans should waste their time.  Furthermore, I am also relieved  that  Amazon.com will allow me future opportunities to evaluate Kubrick's  remaining works.  These caustic remarks will most likely be the  exception.  I must reiterate my praise for all of the other Kubrick films that I was  privileged to see.brick is significantly more skilled than even the talented  Steven Spielberg.

B000000WHX|4.0|I could listen to &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; and &quot;Hymn of the  Big Wheel&quot; for hours before I switched tracks.  They are gooood songs.   The only real qualm I have about this CD is one other song.  Just one  song...  &quot;Blue Lines&quot;.  I don't know why I don't like it.  I just  don't.  Why did they entitle their CD &quot;Blue Lines&quot;?  I thought,  since they named this CD, which graced the world with &quot;Unfinished  Sympathy&quot;, with that song, it would be a gooood song.  Maybe the  reason why I dislike Blue Lines so much is mainly due to disappointment.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This has been one of my favorite cd's since its release over a year ago.  I like to think of Dido as a Sarah McLachlan minus the wimpiness, Sinead  O'Connor minus the annoyance ( I'm actually a fan of both ladies ) or Seal  with ovaries.  The lyrics are articulate without being pompous.  The music  is electronic-esque, without being cold.  And that voice!   Even Eminem  likes her ( she's sampled on the new cd I think, or the first one ).   Standout cuts are &quot;Here With Me&quot;,&quot;Thank You&quot;,  &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot; and the title cut.  I listen to this cd when  I'm on a road trip or just coolin' at home.  If you like Annie Lennox or  modern day Madonna pick this baby up.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Music is an art.  If you are in the music buisness, I guess you are called an artist.   But an artist is (and I quote from the  dictionary)&quot;One...who is able by virtue of imagination and talent to  create works of aesthetic value&quot;.  Ahem.  *cough, cough*  If memory  serves me right, I don't believe she writes her own songs. (So scrap  &quot;imagination and talent&quot;)  The word &quot;aesthetic&quot;, by the  way, deals with beauty and sensitivity to good taste.  I won't comment on  good taste, because it's not my place to judge, but come on!
B0000214F0|3.0|Movies like this look much better in print then they are.  &quot;The Most Controversial Movie in History&quot; is the best title for it.  It is one  of those movies that a bunch of guys rent on a Friday night just to see how  far it goes. Well having seen it I can say that it goes FAR!  WAY TOO FAR!   Do not get me wrong, the acting and the sets are wonderful (the actors that  aren't Penthouse pets or porn stars).  Malcom Macdowell is great in the  title role.  But the movie is just plain sickening.  The porn factor is one  thing (some of the most graphic sexual activity you will ever see in a  major motion picture) but the violence is way out of control.  There is no  redeaming value to watching dogs hungrily eat a man's genetaila after being  castrated.  And the sexual content goes beyond just the graphic orgies.   There is beastiality, necrophilia, homosexuality, midgetry, etc... Sorry  guys, you won't be watching this one in history class anytime soon.  The  movie makes you want to jump in the shower after it ends for there is  nothing clean about it at all.  It is really quite sickening.  But if you  watch it for the basic reason just so you can say you have seen it all,  then there is some value to the film I guess.  But be forwarned, it doen't  just push the limits, it destroys them.
B00004XMS0|4.0|Already owning the 4 titles being released in this trilogy, I wish it came out earlier!  Batman and Batman Returns are two of the greatest gothic  movies of all time.  Tim Burton always does a magnificent job with his  movies, but I feel that he peaked during his stint as the director behind  the bat.  Michael Keaton will always be the real Batman, with Val Kilmer  running a close second.  Batman Forever dutifully carried on the Batman  tradition, yet lacked the tremendous cinematography and gothic styles of  the original 2.  Batman and Robin, however, never needed to be made.   George Clooney never quite settles in as Batman, and Mr. Freeze and Poison  Ivy deserve better treatment as villians.  Overall, each DVD displays a  perfect audio/video transfer, and while lacking in the extra features  section, this set definately deserves a place in everyone's DVD collection.
B00000IACG|4.0|this release is really for the true fans. it goes well with the video, but  i actually got this first and enjoyed it. there are a couple of throwaway  tunes here; &quot;me and thumbelina&quot; and the demo version of  &quot;arpeggiator&quot; for example, are losers. however, there are gems;  &quot;i'm so tired&quot; and &quot;turkish disco&quot; are the kind of  breathtaking tracks i expect from fugazi. but who am i kidding, i could  listen to anything fugazi does 24/7.<br />my only big complaint is that none  of the live songs from the video are here. that would be awesome,  especially since you can't get &quot;furniture&quot; a killer song,  anywhere else. but hey, you never know, a live album could be in fugazi's  future. i just hope to god furniture is on it!

156224003X|5.0|A friend of mine had this book. We were recording together in the studio  and during my down time, I would leaf through the pages of Effortless  Mastery. I found I couldn't put it down, and eventually my friend just  loaned me the book. Kenny has an amazing gift to convey how to get out of  your own way and call upon your higher self and really relax when  performing.  I am a singer and songwriter but I quickly realized that this  information was valuable to anyone with a creative spirit.  I bought  several copies of this book for fellow musician friends and singers. It's  just outstanding!  I love his spiritual insights and how that connects to  your creativity.  Relax, don't try to sound great. Helped me tremendously  during my performances to this day. Excellent contribution Mr. Werner!  Thank you and I highly reccomend this book to anyone who struggles with  &quot;fear&quot; when expressing themselves creatively.
B00000K19E|4.0|People always told me that if you get a DVD player, get The Matrix on DVD.  That it's like THE BEST dvd experience out there.  I was personally  disappointed in the DVD edition.  It has just the minimum stuff - the  commentary, the preview, and the scene selection.  I haven't really seen  too many DVDs that blew me away as opposed to their VHS counterparts, but  they did a decent job in Pink Floyd: The Wall.
0425129586|5.0|I bought this book because I hadn't read a mystery in a while and the  title caught me (it's too bad the title gives away what eventually happens  in the book, though.)  I can't say how amazingly well written this book  was.  This was the first book I ever read by Agatha Christie, and I know  that she's a wonderful author already.  It will keep you guessing until the  last few pages, when at last you learn how he (or she) did it.  Buy this  book-- you won't regret it!!
B00004LN16|5.0|This is perhaps AC/DC's closest-album to their &quot;blues-influence.&quot; Also, you can hear 50's rock n roll in  the  songs mixed with low-down-dirty blues-&quot;licks.&quot; If you like songs  like &quot;Gimme A Bullet&quot; and &quot;POWERAGE&quot; in general, I'd  recommend it to you. Stand-out tunes(IMO):1. &quot;Can't Stand Still&quot;  2. &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; which reminds me of a heavier-version of  &quot;Gone Shootin'&quot; 3.&quot;Meltdown&quot; which is a song I could  picture Bon singing and is a bluesy-rocker 4. &quot;Satellite Blues&quot;  which is very-raw and vintage-AC/DC-sounding 5. &quot;Safe In New York  City&quot; which builds into a &quot;manic-brain-jarring-ride&quot; that  &quot;etches&quot; in the brain  and leaves your heart pounding, and is a  very-aggressive-tune 6.&quot;Give It Up&quot; which really has the  old-classic sound and is a fast-paced tune with Brian screaming like his  balls are in a vice! All the songs do it for me; I love this album, but the  blues-influence is VERY-EVIDENT, so people that don't like the  elegant-simplicity of blues may not like this.....And to the guy that  called Brian a &quot;HOMO&quot; ; grow-up and stop your childish  name-calling.Calling Brian a &quot;HOMO&quot; makes as much sense as  calling Shaquille O'Neal short!
0062502182|4.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a friend.  After reading The  Alchemist, I was left wanting more.<br />The book introduces us to a boy who  is a shepherd, but always appears to smarter than your average person.  He  sets out to find his &quot;treasure&quot; at the Pyramids in Egypt at the  advice of a fortune teller.  Along the way, he encounters many different  types of people as well as several difficult obstacles, and he learns a  great deal from an old alchemist that he meets at an oasis.<br />In searching  for his &quot;treasure,&quot; he embarks on his own &quot;Personal  Legend.&quot;  He staggers upon wealth a couple of times, and he meets  Fatima, the woman of his dreams and his apparent soul mate, only to leave  her in search of his &quot;treasure.&quot;  This book portrays many of  life's lessons, and speaks of one all-knowing universal language.  The book  teaches as it moves along.<br />While the overall background of the book dealt  with his search for his &quot;treasure&quot; and places a high regard on  material wealth, it teaches you to believe in yourself and never give up.   The shepherd became wealthy in wisdom way before he becomes rich.<br />The  book was well written, and has a nice flow, almost as if it has poetic  tones to it.  It is loaded with nice descriptive and philosophical language  that makes for a quick read.  The ending is satisfying, although I would  have truly liked to see what happened next.
B00000DF6O|4.0|B.B. King has been playing the blues for six hundred or so years and has released six million or so albums. The battle for listeners who are trying  to introduce themselves to his work is to decide upon which album to make a  first acquaintance. &quot;Blues on the Bayou&quot; may not be the greatest,  most earth-turning disc the King of the Blues has ever cut, but it sure  sounds the best and, after all, if you expect a six-hundred year old dog to  teach you some new tricks, it's your problem, not his.<br />On the other  hand, if your love of the blues extends to a couple of Gary Moore  compilations and a Jeff Healey live album, &quot;Blues on the Bayou&quot;  ought to be some sort of conversion on the road to Damascus for you (if it  isn't, you're missing something: most likely, the point).<br />It is 1998,  the King is in his dotage, but he's got a crack band behind him, a  seriously funky cat on a soupy, soupy hammond and a production budget to  die for, so everything is tight as a drum and crystal clear. His famous  Gibson, Lucille, sounds the money, too - but then, she ALWAYS sounds the  money.  Even in his prime B.B. never cut up the stage with the guitar  heroics of some of his contemporaries, always being much happier to float a  high E up there, or honk around a bit further down the fretboard all in the  most conversational kind of way. It's an avuncular style which hasn't  changed, and it suits him more and more as he gets on - he gives his band  plenty of room to set up a nice groove.<br />His chatty vocals set the whole  thing off. Just like his guitar playing, B.B. singing is of the blues, but  he never sounds unhappy, as if just having a bunch of the guys kicking up a  righteous shuffle is enough to chase them ol' blues away. After listening  to 45 minutes of this, it's hard to argue with that.
B00000J7JO|3.0|It sure is good to hear the Chillies back in form (for the most part) on this new CD.  I was starting to get a little worried after their last CD,  One Hot Minute.  That was bad enough, but my childhood had almost been  ruined when the insultingly awful &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot; nearly  destroyed all the fond nostalgic memories I had growing up with Blood Sugar  Sex Magik and Mother's Milk (I take my music seriously).  Make no mistake,  this CD isn't quite the classic that BSSM was, but it serves as a reminder  as to why I loved the band in the first place.  The combination of Kiedis'  unique vocals, the sweet-sounding, high pitched guitar lines, and air-tight  rhythm section (Flea in particular) put these guys in the upper tier of the  rap-rock sub-genre.  The fact that they can play their instruments has  always been a plus of theirs, but it also helps that in an album full of 15  or 17 songs that the band relies on different styles to spice things up.   If there's one thing this CD definitely doesn't lack, it's variety.  The  uptempo tunes include Around The World, Get On Top, and the  so-silly-its-lovable I Like Dirt.  These are broken up by the mellower  tunes, which make up a larger percentage of the CD.  The best include the  title track, Scar Tissue, the sleep-inducing, gorgeous Porcelain, Easily  and the complex Savior.  Occasionally it gets a bit boring, as on Emit  Remmus (gnos eht naht retteb si eltit eht) and This Velvet Glove,  occasionally it gets inane, as on Purple Stain, but usually it finds the  Peppers in top form.  This CD should be a huge sigh of relief to the tedium  of One Hot Minute, and while it never reaches the heights of Under The  Bridge or If You Have To Ask, it's a very solid CD that you will not regret  purchasing.
B000001GS4|3.0|This is terrible recorded sound.  I simply cannot forgive the balance engineer, and the people responsible for mic placement for screwing this  one up.  The sound is very thin, and has almost a bleached harshness to it.   To mess up a performance like this makes me want to vomit.  They can tell  you about their 4D Audio Recording System all they want, but the truth is  this doesn't sound like music.  Some will respond to this saying: &quot;but  it is a live performance&quot;.  Yep, DG recorded a live performance of  this piece back in 1987 with Kissin as the pianist and Karajan with the BPO  in the same location.  The sound there, while not perfect is MUCH better  then it is here.  <br />Still, those who are not nutty audiophiles like myself  will probably enjoy this one, because it is really an wonderful  demonstration by Martha Argerich.  While maybe not the best interpretation  by a pianist of this piece there is no denying that this women has  unbelievable amounts of talent and charisma.  I'm not very keen on Abbado  and the Berliners backdrop here, but I think this is mostly due to the  wretched sound balancing.  If this were almost any other performance I  would give this 1 star, but since it is so good I will ignore the sound  quality a little and give it 3. Audio minded people should be warned to  stay away.
B00004XPP0|5.0|First of all, for every one reason people find to not like the  &quot;Special Edition&quot; versions of the &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot;,  there are three reasons to love it!  I'll admit, I don't like the new  version of the &quot;Greedo Scene&quot;, but I do love the new scene added  of Stormtroopers riding the Dewbacks.  I don't like the energy ring that  appears when the Death Star is destroyed, but I love the cleaned up  Landspeeder effects.  I don't like the musical number added to &quot;Return  of the Jedi&quot;, but I love the new ending of &quot;Jedi&quot; that omits  the &quot;Ewok Song.&quot;  I could go on, and on, but I won't.  I will  definitely buy this new Trilogy set for four reasons: Reason #1 is that the  cover boxes were made to match those of the &quot;Episode One&quot; video  cover (and eventually Episodes II and III), and &quot;Special Edition&quot;  is not written anywhere on any of these videos in this new box set - These  are the final versions of these films, accept it and move on!  Reason #2 is  the 10 minute &quot;Making of Episode II&quot; feature.  Reason #3 is that  if you've noticed, this new box set is Rated: Unrated by Amazon.Com, unlike  the previous box sets which were Rated: PG - That means the version  contained in this new box set has been altered by Lucas in some way and did  not go through the ratings process by The Motion Picture Association of  America because it is being released on video and not in theatres - There  have been rumblings by folks at Industrial Light &amp; Magic saying that he  has cleaned up and changed a few other scenes since the re-release - Such  as Obi-Wan getting killed and the &quot;Rancor Scene&quot; from  &quot;Jedi.&quot;  My fourth and last reason for buying it will be that I  love these movies! I watch this Trilogy repeatedly, and until they come out  on DVD, I need to keep buying them because I wear out the ones I have.  So  there!
B00003CWNR|3.0|When a film takes place in two entirely different settings - involving almost two entirely different sets of characters - it inevitably runs the risk that one of the two sides will generate more interest than the other  and that the movie itself will appear to break into halves of unequal  quality.  The end result is that such a film may seem to be disjointed and  lacking in the cohesive unity necessary for any work of genuine art.<br />\\"The  Cider House Rules\\" runs the risk and falls into the trap.  The first  section, set in a Maine orphanage in 1943, fascinates us not merely with  the sheer novelty of the setting but with the central figure of the piece,  the doctor and caregiver who becomes the focus of our attention.  Brilliantly portrayed by Michael Caine, Dr. Larch is a man who provides  love to a collection of children otherwise ignored and abandoned by an  uncaring world.  The most controversial aspect of the character involves  the fact that Dr. Larch also provides abortions for women who want them at  a time when the operation was still illegal and the only other alternative  for many of these women was to suffer at the hands of inept practitioners  of the operation.  \\"The Cider House Rules\\" is certainly to be commended for  tackling a subject that is virtually taboo in commercial moviemaking -  albeit, it must be stated for those who do not adhere to abortion advocacy  that the slant here is decidedly pro-choice despite the script's making a  few gestures to the anti-abortion viewpoint early on in the film.<br />The  center of the film is occupied by a young man named Homer Wells, a  twice-rejected orphan who grows up at the orphanage almost as Dr. Larch's  medical prot&eacute;g&eacute;e and whom Dr. Larch appears to be grooming to take over his  practice from him in the future.  The pseudo father-son relationships  between Dr. Larch and Homer and between Homer and the boys who are in his  charge are conveyed with genuine emotional power and heartwarming  believability.  As prospective parents visit the facility, we feel deeply  the desperation these children have to be adopted and to find a place where  they will fit in.  Conversely, we empathize keenly with the sense of  sadness and personal inadequacy that inevitably accompanies each of their  many rejections.  Even more fascinating is the social context in which the  drama plays itself out.  Because of his willingness to perform the  abortions, Dr. Larch's position at the orphanage has come under attack from  the board of trustees that runs the institution.  Thus, we are all primed  for a gripping showdown between these two opposing forces and wonder how  Homer will fit into the proceedings.<br />Unfortunately, the author John  Irving pulls the rug out from under us as he decides to take his story off  into an almost entirely different direction.  Feeling that he is missing  out on a whole vast world waiting for him beyond the confines of this  remote, isolated community, Homer, rather understandably for a sheltered  young man, decides to abruptly leave the orphanage and to start life anew  as an apple picker when he meets a soldier whose beautiful wife has come to  the doctor for an abortion and whose family is in the cider making  business.  Although Homer's sudden farewell results in a scene of great  emotional power, as a whole torrent of conflicting emotions come flooding  out of both Homer and the people he is leaving behind, the fact is that we  sorely miss the orphanage once we are ripped away from it.  Somehow, the  scenes on the farm - and they constitute well more than half of the film's  running time - never match in intensity and interest those that have come  before.  In fact, the least original and impressive aspect of the film is  the predictable and conventional adulterous affair that Homer and the  soldier's wife, Candy (Charlize Theron), indulge in when her fighter-bomber  husband returns to the war.  Has there ever in the movies been a caseof a  beautiful young wife who did not cheat on her husband the minute he went on  a mission overseas?  The theme of the story - as represented by the posted  list of  \\"cider house rules\\" that we are told by one of the characters are  not too be followed because whoever wrote them didn't live in the cider  house - seems to be that rules are made to be broken, although in some  cases - such as incest - the violation goes so far over the edge that such  an act will always result in disastrous consequences for the perpetrator.  Throughout the film, the characters always seem to be abandoning the rules  set out for them by society.  Dr. Lance performs illegal operations,  creates a phony resume and a set of counterfeit documents in an attempt to  get the board to hire Homer as his assistant, and even deceives Homer into  believing he suffers from a serious heart ailment to keep him out of the  service.  Homer himself seems to suffer little guilt as he pursues a love  affair with the wife of the man who has kindly entrusted him with a job  when he most needs it.<br />More interesting than this theme, however, is  the more subtle one of parents - whether real or ersatz - learning to let  go of the child in whom one has invested all one's dreams and hopes for the  future.  The genuine heartbreak Dr. Lance suffers as Homer leaves to find a  new place in the world becomes almost palpable as written on Caine's  beautifully expressive, craggy face.  Unfortunately, this aspect of the  film is, understandably I suppose, played out almost entirely in scenes in  which letters are exchanged back and forth between the two principals and  in which their feelings are conveyed in the rather undramatic form of  voice-over narration.  In fact, after Homer leaves, Dr. Lance becomes  virtually a minor character in the story and, with his withdrawal from the  scene of action, much of the emotional energy of the earlier portions  drains out of the film.<br />Director Lasse Hallstrom deserves high praise for  the fine performances he has drawn from a uniformly excellent cast.  As  Homer, Tobey Maguire brings a quiet, understated niceness to the pivotal  role. Particularly noteworthy are the young boys who fill the early  sections of the film with so much infectious life and emotion.  They are  cute without being adorable, touching without being cloying.  Hallstrom has  also captured the alternately lush, alternately bleak Maine landscape to  striking effect.eautiful young wife who did not cheat on her husband the minute he went on  a mission overseas?

B00003XB8K|5.0|I first heard Enigma's Sadeness when the song was released back in 1991. I became an instant and devoted fan of the music. I liked The Cross Of  Changes as well but thought that E3 fell off some from what I had expected.  <br />I didn't even know if Enigma was going to come out with a new CD. I  actually fell into it when I was using a friends computer and he had the  MP3 of &quot;Between Mind and Heart&quot;. I've been listening to these  MP3s all day long and can't get enough. Enigma definitely took a step above  the other albums. <br />I don't really like it when Michael Cretu sings, which  I thought was overdone in E3. This CD is a new standard though, the song  &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; is one I play over and over and over. It has a  great rhythm and beat, sounds very steamy and erotic yet dreamy in a sense.  Cretu got back to basics by including his older style and molding it into a  alluring modern sound that seems to be beyond this millenium. <br />Olive  sends spine chilling vocals in the song as well. If you loved MCMXC AD and  are a devoted fan than this is the CD to own in the entire collection, if  you are a new fan you will not be disappointed. I grabbed the MP3s for my  own PC and I'm still going to buy the CD next paycheck (a complete Infinity  home audio system will make you do that just to hear how music is SUPPOSED  to be heard).<br />Two enthusiastic thumbs up!
B000002SE0|4.0|Although Franco Corelli is not usually to my taste there is a great deal  to be impressed by in this recording. He certainly reaches great dramatic  intensity. Sadly his Nessun Dorma is far from the best I've heard. Birgit  Nilsson is, however, spectacular and is not far short of the perfect  Turandot. Scotto is also not to my taste. Although she has a fine (if  shrill) voice she fails to draw you in in this recording.<br />I own the  recording of this opera by Pavarotti, Sutherland and Caballe and I have to  say I prefer it infinitely. I hadn't listened to it for a few months when I  put the recording on again it sent shivers down my spine. Ignore those who  tell you JS doesn't have the dramatic power for a Turandot. She not only  demonstrates some of the most spectacular singing you're likely to hear in  the heights (only bettered by the younger Sutherland. She also begins in a  cold but touching style, but by the end has reached heart-breaking warmth  and beauty. Pavarotti is spectacularly dramatic also, while Caballe is a  devastatingly beautiful Liu. The supporting cast, orchestra, John Aldis  Choir and Mehta are all supurb.
0380713802|4.0|In this book, the American travel writer Bill Bryson decides to take a big trip around all the countries in Europe. He starts at Hammerfest (the northernmost town in Europe), goes through countries including Germany, Holland and Italy, ending at Istanbul (near Asia). He retraces the steps he took as a young student in the early seventies.<br /><br />I wasn`t sure I would like this book because I`m not normally a fan of travel writing, but after reading a bit I began to really enjoy it, because its very funny. Bryson makes lots of wry observations and little jokes about the places he visits (for example, did you know Liechtenstein is the worlds largest producer of false teeth and sausage skins?)<br /><br />He also boasts a near-encyclopedic knowledge of each country he is talking about, so this book is also good if you`re interested in European geography or history, but I think the humor is its best feature.<br /><br />Although the book contains lots of funny jokes, the thing I don`t like is that Bryson has a tendency to swear an awful lot and use bad language in his narrative. Swearing occasionally I can understand, but he does it so much that after a while it ceases to be amusing and Bryson sounds like a 12 year old saying &quot;I can use four letter words! Aren`t I clever?&quot; Bryson has a tremendous talent with words, and there is no need for him to resort to this.<br /><br />Apart from that, I think this is a great book and would recommend it to anyone who likes Bill Brysons humor. If you`re new to the travel writing genre in general, or Bill Bryson, this book is a great place to start - its guaranteed to make you smile.
B00002Z88D|5.0|no rock fan would be complete without this album.it is the only album i  have ever heard with the orchestra are playing live and that must of been  really hard to do. this album gives you a power that you never have felt  before and will most probably never feel again.only a group like metallica  or possibly nirvana could have pulled of a stunt like this with their years  of experience.they have taken the jbest songs out of all of their albums  and mixed them with the san francisco symphoney. this album is truly a  honer to own so before you go out and buy slipknot,Korn or ICP you should  buy the classic stuff which is the best kind of rock money can guy get this  album before you buy any others.it changes the way you think about rock
B00003CXFV|5.0|Margaret Mead once said, &quot;Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world, indeed it is the only  thing that ever has.&quot;  When I watched &quot;Erin Brockovitch,&quot; I  was reminded of Margaret Mead's quote and the notion of people making a  difference.  The location being in California, the big company being sued  is PG &amp; E, the results of the legal battle serves as an inspiration to  all in demonstrating that if we believe in the system, there are victorious  endings for the common people.<br />In the movie, Julia Roberts gives a  phenomenal performance as a sassy, witty, persistent and curious Erin  Brockovitch.  This is, undoubtedly, one of Julia Robert's best  performances!  She should be nominated and awarded an Oscar for &quot;Erin  Brockovitch.&quot;  This movie provides a wonderful balance of comedy,  drama and action.  Viewers will not be bored with this movie - they will  find themselves laughing, crying, and starved with anticipation of what  will come out of all the efforts of Erin Brockovitch.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|When I first came across the music of A-ha around 15 years ago I was  always impressed with their sound. Not one album has gone by in time  leaving me disappointed. I have enjoyed every one, every song and this new  album is continuing that trend. Minor Earth Major Sky sports some pukka  tracks, all of which could be released as singles, and I am sure this album  will bring A-ha back as the supergroup they should always have been.
B00000IL67|5.0|Alice Cooper is the Stephen King of rock music! I like collecting box  sets. The only problem with some box sets is you don't get all of the hits  or get too many demo or alternate versions. Not so with this Alice Cooper  compilation. They are all here! And, for those who don't know much about  the music of Alice Cooper, this box set will give you the complete history  as well as show you the many musical journeys this misunderstood artist has  taken. I say he is misunderstood because there were those in the 1970s (and  perhaps even some today) who wanted to label him as sick, Satanic or not a  &quot;nice guy&quot; as his song &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; would  tell us. Well, guess what? He really is a nice guy. He is a performer. The  Alice we see and hear is a &quot;performance,&quot; not Alice the man. And,  what an incredibly original performer he is - and also quite diverse both  musically and lyrically speaking. As for the not being a &quot;nice  guy&quot; misnomer, even Alice himself admits in the excellent, humorous  and informative booklet that comes with the box set that only his parents  (the Rev. and Mrs.) seemed to know he was still a &quot;nice guy.&quot; He  loved the old horror films and wanted to put that &quot;feel&quot; of the  old films in a live stage show. Nobody did it like Alice Cooper. Of course,  it is not all fun and games with Alice. There are some very haunting and  revealing songs on this compilation including the autobiographical &quot;I  Never Cry&quot; and &quot;How You Gonna See Me Now&quot; as well as other  selections from his excellent concept album &quot;From The Inside&quot;  released after Cooper cleaned himself up after years of alcohol abuse. (I  would also suggest purchasing the import CD From The Inside with the  lyrical help of Elton John buddy Bernie Taupin.) Cooper can do romantic  ballads such as &quot;You and Me&quot; (a song even covered by Frank  Sinatra), make you laugh with songs like &quot;I Love America,&quot; haunt  you with the excellent B-side now finally on CD &quot;No Tricks&quot; and  of course rock like nobody else on the classic tunes &quot;School's  Out,&quot; &quot;I'm Eighteen,&quot; &quot;Hello Hooray,&quot;  &quot;Billion Dollar Babies,&quot; and many more. Of course, some great  rarities and demos are also included in this box set also. I deliberated  for months about getting this box set. Finally, I decided to take the  plunge and just do it. I guess being raised a &quot;good boy&quot; (and a  minister's son just like Alice), I thought I really shouldn't be an Alice  Cooper fan - like it was something I should keep hidden in the closest.  (Now that I'm 40 years old, I guess it is time to admit I've been a closet  Alice Cooper fan all of these years.) Don't wait as long as I did. If you  are an Alice Cooper fan, get this box set. I'm glad I did. The best discs  for me are discs two and three - both of them contain the Classic Alice!

6304913176|5.0|<br />We are humans. <br />The bugs are evil. <br />A military society (&quot;Service guarantees citizenship.&quot;) is the solution to the bug  problem. <br />Lots of killing, satire, and everpresent stupidity. <br />If you  don't take this movie seriously, you will have the best time of your life  watching it. <br />I recommend it highly to society-loathing people with a  sense of humor.
0790729628|4.0|the fans of this film are legion and if you haven't seen it, please do so and ignore all the ratings out there. this is one of those rare films where  you will either like it or hate it.<br />having said that, i think this is a  great film. based very loosely on Phillip K. Dick's 'Do Andriods Dream of  Electric Sheep,' it is a story of a burnt out Bladerunner (special units  that track down and 'retire' rouge android/replicants) on the pursuit of  renegade replicants. as noted by many reviewers, this is a detective movie  -- a futuristic film noir.<br />made in 1982 the look of this film still  impresses. set in the near future (latter 21st century) against a teeming,  oppressive, dark and ultra-urban Los Angeles, there is a real sense of a  believable world -- everything from the costumes to the shots of the city,  to even the advertisements are consistant.<br />after all these years, the  special effects in this film are still good simply because Ridley Scott  didn't relied heavily on it. ultimately, and especially in the Director's  Cut version, the film centers around the internal issue concerning the  separation of man and machine (yeah, corny i know but it works here) and  challenging the validity of one's perception.<br />i think all fans of science  fiction will easily enjoy this film but i also believe that many movie fans  will enjoy not only the story but the wonderful atmosphere of this film as  well.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|Sorry, I just can't enjoy a film that messes with history to the extent that this title does. The mission in the film was nothing to do with the US  - those were BRITISH sailors risking their lives to capture the coding  machine, some years before America even joined WW2! <br />As a Brit myself, I  find this re-writing of history to be in extreme bad taste! I mean, what if  we Brits released a film portraying the moon landings as a British mission,  with a Brit playing Neil Armstrong! You get my point, I'm sure.
0375501851|5.0|Every once in a while, I come across a book that I have to tell everyone I  know about, one that immediately pops into my head when someone asks  &quot;Have you read anything good lately?&quot;  White Teeth is such a  novel.  What an enjoyable, hilarious and exuberantly written work this is.   Zadie Smith is a very talented writer and I only hope that she gives us  more, quickly.  The book opens with Archie Jones' failed attempt at suicide  in London in 1975.  This sounds serious, but Smith handles it with such wit  and aplomb that the scene is hilarious.  We follow Archie, his friend,  Samad Iqbal as they marry, have children and watch their children grow up  in a London they just don't understand.  The characters are hilarious.   Archie is completely clueless, but that doesn't bother him.  Samad is a  frustrated intellectual stuck being a waiter, trying desperately to  validate an act of bravery of one of his ancestors.  Their children come of  age in the cultural and ethnic melting pot that is modern London.  Smith's  characters are all wonderfully unique and terrifically funny.  I highly,  highly recommend this book.  It lives up to, and surpasses, any of the hype  you may have heard.
B00003CXFG|4.0|What can you say about another &quot;Alien&quot; movie? The cast, who I thought did an excellent job, worked with a tired plot where there is a  &quot;good guy&quot; and a &quot;bad guy&quot;. The movie tries to show  that the bad guy character is bad in the beginning, but we all figure out  the plot way ahead of time and that he will become one of the &quot;good  guys&quot;. The plot does run very typical of a horror movie. People get  killed one-by-one. For me the enjoyment of the movie was the special  effects of the modern-day vampires. The ending also was a twist of what  everyone thought was going to happen but didn't (exactly). I would  recommend this flick to everyone who enjoys Sci-fi, horror and special  effects. This movie can be seen over and over again and still be very  enjoyable.
B00004TJK2|1.0|This is one of my favorite movies, but the director's cut is a definite  pass.  Those interested in an offbeat, strange but good movie should find  the original theatrical version and skip this one.  The theatrical version  isn't a comedy, a romance, or anything that could categorized, but it was  whimsical, quiet, full of tiny character details sharply etched.  The film  score by Bill Conti accented that whimsy and surrealism.  In the director's  cut, the film score by Eric Serra makes the movie nearly unwatchable.  The  49 extra minutes shows that Besson had intended a straight melodrama, which  doesn't work.  The extra footage spoils the timing of key scenes and  introduces unnecessary characters &amp; subplots.  Not a single minute of  the extra footage adds anything to the original movie.
0380796090|5.0|Watermelon is an excellent first novel.  The main character, Claire, tells the story of how she learns to move on with her life after her husband,  James, leaves her the day she gives birth to their daughter.  Claire is a  lighthearted character, and even when she's in tremendous pain over the  deception and betrayal of her husband, she tells the reader all about it in  a very comical manner.  Claire's family, an odd and entertaining bunch  themselves, are very supportive and loving while she heals from her pain  and waits to see what will become of her marriage.  And Adam, a handsome,  younger man also helps Claire heal and see herself in a very different  light.  Claire has a witty, endearing voice that will make you love her  immediately.  The story itself is very interesting, and is told in a very  comical manner, so you won't be able to put the book down.  And the ending  is very funny.  Watermelon is an excellent summer read.
0515123447|4.0|This novel was interesting, to say the least. The plot was well developed  and very detailed, but some descriptions were a little on the gory  side...definately NOT material for a person with a weak stomach. Also, the  author's writing style was a little abrupt and hard to read at times.  However, I thought that this book was good airplane reading material.
B00003CXGG|1.0|Hi!   This movie is an excuse to laugh at the poor, terrible, acting, and for teen-guys to check out aaliyah.   i normally would love this type of  movie, but there was nothing special about this sell-out.  the plot is the  same as any old action movie you will find, and there is absoloutley no  reason why they call it romeo must die.  there is no love in this movie.   there is nothing but horrible action by both aaliyah and jet li.  sorry to  say that, but that's my opinion.  unless you would like to make sure what  i'm saying is true, there is no good reason to see this movie.  it's one of  the dumbest movies i have seen ever.  i know i sound very crittical, but  it's true.  no laughs, good fight scenes, love, or anything worth more then  1/2 of a star.  this movie can be classified as the same category of the  jackie chan movies, where they don't speak english.  jet li should never  have taken this role, and aaliyah should stick to singing.
0780631153|5.0|There is so much to be said about this film... I almost didn't watch it because I had heard some bad things.  Of course my curiosity won out and  from the first scenes I was enthralled.  Yes, these are whiney victims or  nasty people. However,I was drawn into their characters and really did care  about how things turned out for them.  Brilliant writing, directing and  performances--not a bad one in the bunch.  I think this is a film you will  either love or hate. It touched me emotionally and spirtually.  If you  don't get the same, you just don't and I expect you would be bored to  tears.  Special thanks to Tom Cruise and Julianna Moore for wonderful  performances.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|I bought it for the song &quot;Paper Bag&quot;, but as it turns out, I  love the whole album. Her voice is just amazing.
B000002U8G|4.0|An amazing album that paved the way for Dark Side of the Moon. Echoes  alone makes this worth buying. It is easily one the Floyd's best and can  stand up to pretty much any other song recorded. The album as a whole is  great with weaker tracks like &quot;Seamus&quot; bringing it down a little.  The opener &quot;One of These Days&quot; is a great instrumental piece and  &quot;pillow of Winds&quot; is is a nice relaxing song with a floating  quality.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|Maybe a good movie but woefully inaccurate historically. The stealing of the Enigma machine actually occurred before the US entered WWII.... I guess  sooner or later Hollywood will have rewritten history to such an extent  that the US will always have existed and that Europe is in fact a US  colony, not the other way round!
B00004TH83|5.0|Mixing classic ballads with R&amp;B and dance is what this album is all  about.  Lara's breathy singing voice conveys the emotion in each song.   &quot;I Will Love Again&quot; makes the listener want to dance, while songs  such as &quot;Adagio&quot; touch the soul and leaves the listener in total  shock.  An album of true beauty is what Lara Fabian has created.
B0000026WD|5.0|I really like this album because the songs on this album are excellent. I really like the songs Jam, Why You Wanna Trip On Me, She Drives Me Wild,  Remember The Time, Can't Let Her Get Away, Black Or White, Who Is It, Give  In To Me, Will You Be There, and Dangerous because I think these songs are  the best songs I've ever heard. The other songs on this album are okay and  I think they're pretty good but I like the songs I just mentioned are  excellent. I really like Michael Jackson because he is my favourite singer  at I really really like his music. My nephew and I listen to his music and  we sometimes pretend that we are on stage at a concert and we are singing  the songs that Michael Jackson sings.<br />I think Michael Jackson did a great  job on the Dangerous album and I think he does a great job on all of his  albums. I listen to his music all the time on my CD Player and I also  download his songs on the computer. The Dangerous album is the greatest CD  I've ever listen to.
B000000W6X|5.0|Massive Attack corral together assorted vocalists and guest artists to  form their 1994 effort Protection, and the mix of styles makes this album  really shine.  The CD starts off with the noted single  &quot;Protection,&quot; featuring the rich voice of Tracey Thorn.  Other  songs incorporate the vocals of Tricky, Nicolette, and Horace Andy (as well  as Massive's own 3-d). While the vocalists' differing styles lend  themselves to different types of songs, a laid-back tempo and strong bass -  guaranteed to satisfy the rhythm lover in you - unify the 10 songs on  Protection.  The two instrumental pieces, the jazzy &quot;Weather  Storm&quot; and the mysterious &quot;Heat Miser,&quot; reinforce this  theme.  Bottom line: Protection is a solid, powerful, aptly titled release.   Curl up on a winter's night and let this album warm you.
B000002J09|5.0|Although I am often annoyed by reviews that don't stick to the album  itself, let me start off be being a hypocrite and saying that I agree 100%  with Ms.  Eaton's review right below.  I just graduated first in my class,  with a 1600 on my SATs, and will be going to an Ivy League University.  I  love Led Zeppelin, every smart person I know loves Led Zeppelin, and I will  still love them when I have my own PhD.  So take that Gragdy! Ok, now that  I got that bit of self-indulgence out of the way, the album: this is my  favorite of Zeppelin's album, maybe tied with Physical Graffiti.  The best  song on here is &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;, not only the best blues  rock song that Led Zeppelin did, but probably the best that any British  blues revivalists recorded.  And then, of course, there's  &quot;Stairway&quot;--eight minutes of perfection.  &quot;Going to  California&quot; is the third best song on here; a nice ballad, although I  find it ironic that it is Bonzo-free.  &quot;Levee&quot; makes up for that,  though.  &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot; is not one of my favorites, but it  is still excellent.  &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Misty Mountain  Hop&quot;, and especially &quot;Black Dog&quot; are amazing hard rockers--I  don't think &quot;Four Sticks&quot; quite matches up to them, though; it is  the one minor weak spot of the album.  Not a bad song, but not as inspired  as everyhthing else on here. So there you have it--a swirling stew of  blues, rock, and folk, all served up with amazing passion and power (and a  great sound--everyone knows Page was a great guitarist, but his underrated  skill at production is what made Zeppelin records sound truly great, and is  one of the reasons they have aged so well.)  Hard rock doesn't get any  better than this.
0800187814|4.0|Strange bedfellows, those two, Jerry Falwell and Larry Flynt.  I never liked either one of them, which is why it has taken me so long to get  around to watching this movie.  Make no mistake about it, the central point  here is that Falwell and Flynt are two sides of the same coin: pick your  pig.<br />Milos Forman's direction starts slow and is almost without  distinction nearly three-quarters through, yet the entire movie is saved by  that last quarter after Flynt is shot.  I think there is something to be  said for boring your audience a little in the beginning, showing them only  the tired and ordinary just so they will better appreciate it when the  going gets good.  And it does.  I think this strategy worked on me: after  rot gut even vin ordinaire can seem like the ambrosia of the  gods.<br />Turning Larry Flynt into an American hero, as this movie does, may  seem a bit of a stretch, yet consider the obverse: Jerry Falwell as our  hero.  Now THAT is a bit scary.<br />Courtney Love proves herself to be a  wonderful exhibitionist (but we knew that) as well as a natural and  talented actress (we didn't know that) who knows how to have a good time in  front of the camera; and I think that is half the task for an actor: love  the red light; love the audience looking at you.  Woody Harrelson, in  keeping with Foreman's direction seems to be walking through the part in  the beginning, looking almost like a clone of himself from Natural Born  Killers (1994) with a fey hair style; but he picks up steam, and as the  paralyzed Flynt really comes to life and gives a fine performance.  Ed  Norton is also excellent and so believable and winning as Flynt's lawyer,  especially in the scene before the Supreme Court.  Think about it: in this  movie the lawyer is the good guy!<br />Politically speaking this is a no  brainer, a shoot the fish in the barrel exercise: First Amendment wins out  over public figures wanting to manage their images.  Thank you.  And what  IS more obscene, sex or war?  Strange that that should be a question, but  it is and has been for at least a couple of millennia.  When I was young I  used to wonder why.  Wasn't it obvious that sex was good and war was bad?  However, it is not so simple.  It turns out that sex (which leads to the  creation of  new karmas) is really just the obverse side of the coin of  war.  You make `em, in some circumstances, you have to kill `em. That's why  the other guy's sexuality is offensive, and why we have prudes.  Sex really  is war by other means.  I always think of the example of Easter Island  where initially they practiced a fertility religion until the island's  protein resources ran out, and then came the repression of reproduction and  sex.  Christianity is a religion one step removed from the old fertility  religions in this sense.  It is paranoid (in its more conservative forms)  about sexuality because it has evolved to fear unbridled reproduction.  Of  course its practitioners, like Jerry Falwell, have no understanding of  this: they are just social and political animals acting out their social  and political roles.<br />In short, like most things in life, this film is a  flawed but interesting venture.  Incidentally, the so-called \\"unusual\\"  marriage between Flynt and Althea Leasure is one of the things that makes  this movie good: their marriage is a lot more like real life than ninety  percent of what we see in the movies.e, sex or war?

B000002BVN|5.0|I think this album is one of Michael Jackson's best. I like the remixes on  this album because I think they sound great. I like the song Blood On The  Dance Floor because I think this is Michael's best song. I think Michael  Jackson did a super great job of this album, and I also think that Michael  Jackson is the best pop singer in the world.
B00000J7JO|5.0|Disturbing in the sense that everyone loves them now. Before they released  this, many people thought they were either weird or highly immature. But  sadly, taking this break between albums has left them a little too grown  up, yet still producing a great new record. Seeing young kids buying this  has me a little worried. There is a good chance they have no idea what the  word fornicate means, and if they ever tell their parents what the name of  the CD they just bought is, they'll be in for quite a surprise. Not quite  as big as the surprise they'll get when they buy Freaky Styley or The Abbey  Road EP. True Chili Peppers fans will know what I'm talking about, and I  will not continue on this topic any further for fear of angry 14 year olds  demanding an explaination. The whole record is full of Under The Bridge  type songs, fuzzy Hendrix guitar and depressing, dark lyrics. The general  theme of it is that no matter how much the media glorifies Hollywood and  California, people will still become lost (as in soulfully lost) there. A  very deserty, airy vibe flows through the music nicely. They have lost  their funk though, but that is replaced with flowing guitar lines  reminescent of later Jane's Addiction and One Hot Minute era Chili Peppers.  This is obviously an element of John Frusciante's and with that I will  close my review. Suggested tracks: Californication, Scar Tissue, Parallel  Universe, Road Trippin', This Velvet Glove, Porcelain, Around The World.  Suggested bands: Jane's Addiction, Jimi Hendrix Experience. Suggested  albums: Jane's Addiction's Kettle Whistle, Jane's Addiction's Nothing's  Shocking, Red Hot Chili Peppers' One Hot Minute. Highly suggested- Best of  1999.
B00003CXFG|5.0|yo when i first went into this movie I was thinking well thisshould be an okay sci fi movie.So the movie began and i was amazed how great the effects and how good vin diesel who played the hero of this film ,great performance .well anyway towards the end i was like this is a great movie but the all the sudden it came up a part where riddick (vin diesel) a killed and alien and said my fav line &quot;he must not have known who he was...with&quot; and right there i was like this movie and great it is a sci fi classic i highly recommend this
B00000JCB2|5.0|For those of you who like LImp's 1st hit &quot;Faith,&quot; I recommend  getting &quot;Significant Other.&quot;  The best songs on here are:  &quot;Just like this&quot; &quot;Break Stuff&quot; &quot;N2gether now&quot;  and &quot;trust&quot;
B00004XPP0|5.0|Some of you will not agree with me, yeah I do love the original release (that's the one I grew up with) but lets be realistic money and technology  did not allowed Lucas to put on film what he had visioned. Those who think  that Lucas is trying to make a few bucks more by the holidays, well perhaps  but have in mind that the last release was 3 years ago and no longer  available for the new comers, yeah new people who just entered the S/W  galaxy after episode 1 are able to get the trilogy now. And those  complaining about the re-release have in mind that video movies suffer from  wear and tear; If you guys know so much about movies you'll know what  happened to Little Mermaid from Disney; I saw people paying up to $250.00  for an used copy when it entered in moratory, thank God Disney returned the  movie again for those who missed it the first time around and even rentals  for this movie was becoming almost imposible because the movie was near  extinction;  Very clear I will state that this is the chance for the new  generation of Star Wars fans to get it so you complaintful people measure  your thoughts before typing them here, I'll buy it again.
6303430570|5.0|For anyone interested in side-splitting comedy, Clerks is the movie for you.  However, there is one fatal editing error in the movie that no one  thus far has noticed except me.  When Dante's girlfriend Veronica brings  him lasagna, she says, &quot;I'll see you when you close then.&quot;  The  big mistake?  At this point in the movie, Dante doesn't know that he will  be forced to close!   Just a little tidbit I thought everyone would like.
0141301066|5.0|It's been a while since I've read Dahl's children's books, and I'd actually never before read _Matilda_.  I remembered seeing advertisements  for the movie version a few years ago, then forgot about it completely.   Somehow, I ended up buying this book, just remembering how much one of my  college roommates loved it, and find that I feel the same way.  It is a  wonderful book about a little girl who is more than just a prodigy at math  and reading...she's almost like a kind old soul in a little girl's body.   The way she temporarily escapes her mundane existence with the most  annoying, awful parents there are reminds me of how I used to be a  voracious reader, when I was young (not that I had awful parents, but I  didn't particularly care for the school I went to).  The book _Matilda_  provides a similar escape - suddenly, you're no longer in a small,  overcrowded airport, waiting for your plane that's been delayed an hour.   You're in the classroom of an English village, watching Matilda stun her  teacher by doing complex calculations, and using that wonderful brain of  hers to seek revenge on the horrible Miss Trunchbull, headmistress/ogre of  the school.  A brilliant book - one I would particularly recommend giving  to a child who all too often feels powerless.
0312243022|5.0|to the lauditory reviewers of 'The Hours.'  I began reading the book out  of obligation to a reading group commitment, and within a few pages, I  began to see the brilliance of Cunningham's interweaving--his obvious  knowledge of the mind, life, and style of Virginia Woolf, and especially  his understanding of the internal conflicts of women like Clarissa and Mrs.  Brown.  The conclusion to 'The Hours' is stunning and brilliant. . . in  fact, it drove me to reread 'Mrs. Dalloway,' which I had not read for  years.  I read Woolf's novel with new understanding and appreciation,  especially as to its uniqueness in its time.  I was also struck with  Cunningham's brillance in the use of various details of the original novel,  while still maintaining the integrity of his own constructed story.
B0000062GE|5.0|From beginning to end this album is something everyone can relate to. I  fist heard it right when I needed to hear something to enhance my mood.<br />  My favorite songs on this album are: &quot;Darkest Days&quot;  &quot;Everything I Touch I Break&quot; &quot;Drugstore&quot; &quot;Save  Yourself&quot; &quot;haunting me&quot; &quot;The Thing I Hate&quot; and  Waking up Besides You&quot;<br /> I found this album after my byfriend broke  up with me and I found that I was just what I needed to hear. It helped me  to find myself again. The music is a mix between Dark, Moody, Angry and  Indifferent. I love it.
B00000BKE0|5.0|I think that some people don't know what the deal is. They probably have  never even heard any songs of Iron Maiden, but yet the have the  to write  down negative comments about the band. I think that Iron Maiden is the best  band around, by far, and the 3 damn stars that were given is messed up!!!  Totally messed up!!! This is a darn good album, worth every penny I spent  for it. I don't like to read about people who think this band isn't any  good, cause Iron Maiden brings the house down, everytime!!! When someone  says  they don't like Iron Maiden, it's like someone telling me, &quot;You  are a piece of trash!&quot;. You won't ever become a friend of mine with a  negative attitude towards Iron Maiden. I agree with Lars Swanson!!! He is  100% right. I have been a fan of Maiden ever since they came out with their  first album. Satanic? That is a laugh!!! This band needs more credit!!! So  give it to em people!!! P.S. I have seen Iron Maiden 15 times in concert!!!  HAIL IRON MAIDEN!!!
6303014100|5.0|This is, by far, the best movie ive ever seen!  All of the battle scenes are incredible, and the actors portray the men involved brilliantly.  Tom  Berenger is especially good as the often misunderstood and underestimated  Gen. James Longstreet.  This movie is long, but definately worth it!
0790729725|4.0|When i watched 'Goodfellas' i was shocked, this isnt a bad thing, far from it, in fact this made me want to watch the whole thing over.  The base line  for the entire story is with 'Henry Hill', who is Irish Sicilian, growing  up in 'Mob Land' Brooklyn.  He becomes a faithful 'Family' member - a  Goodfella, until something happens to push his cosy enviroment into chaos.  Appearances from the likes of Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (Nicky from  'Casino') and Ra Liotta (as Henry), make this a brilliant cast, who really  do make thismovie spectacular.  Most probably the most 'controversial'  Mafia flick ever produced, a must see for anyone.
B00000IGGA|5.0|I had never heard of Tom Waits before someone played this CD for me, so my  perception will be a little different than others.  I've since rounded out  my Waits catalog nicely, but here's my impression as a first-time  listener.<br />Waits has several voices on this album, none of them  conventionally pretty -- the howl for &quot;Come on up the house,&quot; a  sneer for &quot;Big in Japan,&quot; the growl of &quot;What's he  building,&quot; and the cracked moan of &quot;House where nobody  lives.&quot;  Ordinarily, the unconventional vocals would drive me off, but  the lyrics and sounds pulled me in.<br />Waits is a master lyricist; he's good  at sly irony and unconventional wordplay.  He tells stories about people  we've never heard of and makes us care about them because he does.  He's  constantly looking at the world with one eye half-shut and the other wide  open.<br />The musical accompinament enhances the twisted lyrics.  It sounds  like there was a different band for each track.  There's an industrial-rock  pound, then a piano ballad, then a dirty swamp hootenanny, then a gospel  combo.  All different, all weird, all wonderful.<br />Which is where the voice  comes back in.  He doesn't sound like Sinatra, but these songs were written  for nobody but Tom.  His voice changes character like the songs themselves,  entwining with sound effects and music or beating them into submission as  the situation requires.  Everything fits so well I picture Waits playing  every instrument himself, all at once.<br />If you appreciate great  songwriting and don't mind a gruff delivery, take this one home.  Listen to  it in the dark with your eyes closed and wait for goosebumps.
6305903182|3.0|1, 2, 3, yes this is number 3, the last one, phew!  Well before i say much about 'Scream 3', i want to just say how it slid downhill from the first  one which was mediocre to say the least.  I thought they whould stop at 2,  but they kept churning them out from the old Scream'O'matic, but we have  been assured this is a trilogy so this is it, the last encounter, you could  say. <br /> For the film, well to be honest it follows the pattern of a lot of  trilogys, No.1, Quite Scary and original, No.2, starting to get on you  nerves, and No.3, well this is more of a comedy than a horror, in my view.   The 'kills' are not well staged and no suspense is built up, which sort of  defeats the object.  There is one factor of this i liked however, The fact  that the murderer was........ oops nearly said it then, no but seriously id  get my mate to buy this one then borrow it off them, only a 3 star though.
B000002H97|5.0|I listen to a lot of music, and I mean a lot, and I own a lot of CDs, but  this is by far the best album I have.  I have a 3 CD changer player on my  stereo and no matter what I am playing, this CD is always in there.  I  don't know if this review will be helpful to you, but just listen to a  couple songs and you'll know what I am talking about.
B00000DCHI|5.0|I don't know why the comparison to John Lennon and Paul McCartney hasn't  been made about Billy Joel.  Like the aforementioned Beatles, Joel can rock  and he can compose soft sounds, both of which turn out very well. What can  you say?  He just isn't given enough credit these days.  This album is  great, but correct me if I'm wrong, but a couple songs aren't as long on  this greatest hits album as they are on their original.  For example, at  the end of &quot;My Life&quot; the little piano solo is missing, and  &quot;Pressure&quot; doesn't clock in at the same time as it does on  &quot;Nylon Curtain.&quot;  A small complaint, but odd nonetheless.
B000006045|5.0|Probably the best CD I've bought all year.
630516889X|3.0|I remember 'Predator' from many years ago when I was younger and remember enjoying it. Watching it again recently on DVD made me re-examine it. For a  start, there's no plot at all, at least with Alien for example there were  some decent twists. Secondly, the almost 100% male cast hardly say anything  let alone have any decent characterisation. Thirdly, it's quite boring! The  Arnie / Predator fight sequence at the end tends to go on for about a third  of the film!<br />The DVD isn't very hot either - no special features at all  and the picture quality is reasonable to poor (probably from a bad print).  Sound quality is okay, some of the surround effects are good but nothing  stands out.<br />In summary, it's okay - it's a must-have if you're an Arnie  fan but looking back on 'Predator' it's not much of a classic!

6304039506|5.0|Brando, Leigh, Hunter, and Malden all excel in their respective roles in  Tennessee Williams' flawless tale set in steamy and erotic N'Orleans.  Everything works in this film: the direction, the acting, the  cinematography, and the jazzy and seductive scoring of Alex North.<br />Elia  Kazan has given the world one of the greatest adaptations of a Broadway  great.
6303997198|5.0|This movie is one of my all-time favorite romances. It begins with adult siblings looking through their deceased Mother's things where they discover  a secret. They &quot;find their way&quot; to a letter from their Mother  (Francesca played by Meryl Streep) which is the content of this movie  (along with 3 journals.) Francesca's words in the letter to her children  open the story. &quot;I know it sounds awful but I couldn't wait for you  all to leave. You were going to be gone until Friday. Four days--just four  days.&quot; This is where the story begins, in the past.<br />&quot;THE  BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY&quot; is about these incredible life-changing  four days of Francesca and Robert. The Father and children had left to  enter a steer into a fair and Francesca stayed home. Not long after  Francesca's family leaves, a photographer who is lost (Robert Kincaid  played by Clint Eastwood) drives up to ask for directions to a covered  bridge. She tries to tell him but they both get confused because the roads  aren't marked. Of course if they would have been, this love story would  have never have happened. The way their affair begins so innocently is part  of what makes the story so compelling for me. Streep and Eastwood together  are amazing; and their growing  friendship and deep love that follows is  magical. Both of their acting is flawless in my eyes as well as the music,  script and cinematography. Eastwood is an impressive producer as well as  director.<br />It is such a wonderful story I could paraphrase the whole  thing;  but I won't. Just enjoy each moment of their 4 days together which  go on forever in their hearts. I think the moral of &quot;THE BRIDGES OF  MADSION COUNTY&quot; is to be grateful for every day of our lives. Life is  a long-winding road full of joy and sorrow. We must survive the sorrow and  truly cherish the joy while at the same time remembering that our decisions  affect not only us but our loved ones as well. The ending is  magnificient.<br />As my wise Father told me once: &quot;Live your life so  that you'll have no regrets and try to accomplish that which will be best  for everyone.&quot;ient.<br />As my wise Father told me once: &quot;Live your life so  that you'll have no regrets and try to accomplish that which will be best  for everyone.&quot;
B000000OA6|5.0|This is definitely Queen's best studio-recorded album ever made. From the sublime title track to the haunting THE SHOW MUST GO ON this is a whirwind  ride through all aspects of Queen music. There are ballads, rockers, guitar  solos and of course Queen's trademark gospel choir-ish backing vocals. For  an album containing five greatest hits, two of my five favourite Queen  songs and a world-famous epic (THESE ARE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES), I was  expecting some pretty impressive music. However I would never have expected  such a mind-blowing performance from the band who, it has to be said, were  supposedly in decline at the time. The title song, INNUENDO, is no ordinary  opening track. Clocking in at six minutes thirty-one seconds and spanning  more rhythms and styles of music than most groups would start to consider  including in a whole album, it is up there with WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS and  BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY in my humble but usually damn accurate opinion. The best  bit is the Spanish guitar interlude and the subsequent Brian May imitation  on the electric guitar, although the deep and meaningful part sandwiching  it is world class. I'M GOING SLIGHTLY MAD is a dreamy, off-the-wall effort  by Freddie, who alludes to his mental state (&quot;I'm one card short of a  full deck&quot;) with startling and laughable clarity and honesty.  HEADLONG, a top-twenty blockbuster in Great Britain, is the first of four  fantastic rockers and probably the best of the lot. The lyrics don't make  much sense but the same can be said for all the riptide efforts. I CAN'T  LIVE WITH YOU follows suit with a catchy riff and superb vocals from the  band. The beautiful DON'T TRY SO HARD features Freddie trying his hand at a  falsetto, an area where he has excelled himself many times before. On RIDE  THE WILD WIND you have to pinch yourself repeatedly to realize just how  fast it is. The song is basically a thumping beat combined with the odd  twinging of the guitar strings and powerful lyrics fromFreddie. ALL GOD'S  PEOPLE is the only calamity on this otherwise immaculate album, as Queen  (and Mike Moran who contributes to the song) scrape the bottom of the  lyrics barrel quite unnecessarily. The album is steadied by the classic  tear-jerker THESE ARE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES, a song that comes with the  band's last video as a foursome, and DELILAH, a short ditty on par with I'M  GOING SLIGHTLY MAD in the weird stakes and apparently about Freddie's cat,  gets it back on track. THE HITMAN offers some of the heaviest Queen sounds  ever recorded to go with a riff that mixes the traditional Queen sound with  an experimental and futuristic ambience. The result: an extraordinary  rocker that inexplicably never became a hit. BIJOU is a beautiful  instrumental but for a brief lyric from Freddie about the usual lurve sort  of thing, featuring mind-boggling strumming from the talented Mr May,  which, despite being able to walk into any other groups repertoire no  problem, does not prepare the listener for the blood-curdling finale, THE  SHOW MUST GO ON. Everything about this song is perfect: the opening organ  loop, the incredible vocal gymnastics from Freddie, the quality of the  lyrics, the drumming... well, this is quite simply the best Queen song  ever, full stop.
B000002JEV|5.0|This collection of songs recorded from BBC sessions is a quite oustanding collection showing Zeppelin as a young fire breathing blues band.  The  first side contains a powerhouse of tunes with numerous versions of  &quot;communication breakdown&quot; and a couple of versions of &quot;i  can't quit you baby&quot;.  This was zeppelin showing the kind of raw power  and danger of their first two albums and many of the versions of the songs  on this colleciton actually outdo the original studio work, the sound is  tougher and louder encompassing this period of Led Zeppelin better.  The  songs are also extended with dramatically lengthened versions of &quot;i  can't quit you baby&quot; and &quot;dazed and confused&quot;, the first of  many classics the group would do.  Travelling Riverside blues, a robert  johnson cover is brilliant and is probably one of the best songs never to  get onto a zeppelin studio album thanks to Page's excellent guitar  playing.<br />The second side is an actual live show done for the BBC which  was done around mid '71 taking in the more electic focus of Zeppelin 3 and  ZOSO with a slightly tamer but still immensley powerful attack to the  songs.  It is clear though that Zeppelin have matured from the first side  and the performance they give is something quite special.  The medley at  the end is an obvious standout but it's the quieter songs such as  &quot;going to california&quot; which shows us the leaps and bounds by  which zeppelin have acheived since their earlier work.  Their effort of  &quot;stairway to heaven&quot; is also a defining moment and is a great  introduction to one of the all time great songs.  Black Dog is another  great song, and by using the &quot;out on the tiles&quot; intro, nobody saw  it coming.  What continues to amaze from this release is their ability to  play live, there is not a moment where they seem to lose the rhythm or go  out of time to each other, making the &quot;greatest live band&quot; tag  easily theirs.The other thing is on the alternate versions of the studio  songs, even though they may be drastically different, they still clock in  more often than not at the same time, showing their ability at transforming  a song without sacrifice.<br />Basically this album is excellent and shows  clearly that as a live group they were loud and they were untouchable
B00000K19E|3.0|Personally I think that this movie is not much what it was hyped up to be.  Much like that other overrated movie in 1999 called  Star Wars Episode  1.<br />     This movie supposedly brags a very &quot;unique&quot; story. I  personally dont think so. To me it is nothing more than a normal plot that  could have been used in an episode of &quot;the Twilight Zone&quot; with  alot of special effects.<br />     The special effects are very good. And that  is what keeps this movie from being a complete mess. I saw how they made  the revolutionary effects and that was very cool. The sound effects are  very good too. This is one of those DVD's like &quot;Saving Private  Ryan&quot; that has sound soooo good it makes you proud to have a DVD  player. The sound, picture quallity, and the extras are what made me get  the DVD. <br />     The acting in this movie is horrible. Lt me repeat that,  horrible! I hate Reeves's acting. To me I think that the acting is one of  the most vital roles to a movie. The rest of the cast's acting is not  Academy Award winning either.<br />     The direting is fairly good,  escpecially for a sci-fi juggernaut of a film, but I do not advise turning  the movie into a a trilogy like the Star Wars movies. That would be a utter  mess. The directors of this movie had a box office hit and now they think  they can keep the franchise going. Soon we will be seing everything from  action figures to lunchboxes that have been spawned from this redicules  movie. Not only are they turning it inot a trilogy, they are filming the  movies back to back. The Star Wars movies took years to write and plan.  They turned out marvelous except the latest installment. The Matrix is  being made within a few years. That is what you call rushing the movies to  cash in on the original and ruining the whole series.<br />     Remember the  &quot;Rocky&quot; series. One big hit that was really good untill the  endless terrible sequels it spawned ruined that reputation and respectfor  the original.<br />     I hope this review has been helpful to you, and thank  you for your time.
B000002J1U|5.0|On this album ,Zeppelin begin to become more electic in their music after  two raunchy blues albums to get the ball rolling.  They haven't completely  left their power behind though.  IMMIGRANT SONG is a short but immensley  powerful song with plants banshee wail like nothing you've ever heard.   CELEBRATION DAY has a brlliant warped slide guitar riff and OUT ON THE  TILES is an underrated classic zeppelin tune with its funky swagger.  SINCE  I'VE BEEN LOVING YOU is a brilliant epic not quite of the same standard as  other zeppelin epics but it still remains a concert favourite. But the  secret of this album is the folky side of it which is excellent throughout.   GALLOWS POLE is a menacing interpretation of a Leadbelly classic,  BRON-YUAR-STOMP is an infectious tune, but the standouts ore most  definately TANGERINE which is a quite amazing tune showing how much  Zeppelin have matured as can be said for THAT'S THE WAY which is equally  pristine and one of their best compositions.<br />What this album does is show  you that Led Zeppelin were far more than straight blues rock or heavy  metal, their compositions were detailed thoughtful and even sensitive and  of all their albums, this shows that side of them best and also gives us a  little sneak preview of what was to come next.
0790749858|2.0|Let me start this conversation by stating that this movie was an utter failure. When me and my friend decided to see this movie a few years back  we thought we were in for some totally insane comedy by the Looney Tunes  cast. Boy were we wrong.      This movie was not good. I gave it two stars  because it had a few suprising cameos in it like Bill Murray that were  actually funny. This movie degrades the image of Bugs and the rest of the  Warner Bros. cast. As i remember that in the cartoons most of the  characters were afraid of nothing, no matter what size and they could  overcome any obstacle. On this movie the cartoon character you grew to love  has been degraded into crying little babie that cant outwitt a bunch of  martian idiots. How lame! Bugs Bunny, the cartoon character that was know  for his talent to out witt all that try to get him couldnt even stop them.  Why would they nee the help of an over the hill basketball player, Michael  Jordon, when they are cartoon characters that can do anything they want. I  once thought that cartoon characters were unstoppable- not anymore.      I  hate this movie. It goes against everything you grew to love in your  childhood. Maybe your children will like it. The original cartoons will  always be the best no matter what tries to out do them.         Thank you  for your time.
B00004SCX6|3.0|First of all, her music is great to listen to and to play at dances and stuff. But come on! It's all overproduced. She cannot sing any of these  songs live. I saw this TV special where she lip synched the whole thing.  Her music is catchy, and yes i do have both of her cds but she has no  talent. Well Max Martin did a great job producing and writing her stuff but  she'll be gone in like a couple of years from now. I loved this CD when it  came out, but now I realize that it's not like she put any effort into this  CD. She only wrote one song, Dear Diary, which is not good. If she wasn't  pretty and she was singing baby one more time no one would like her.  Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson have a lot better voices and they  perform a lot better.  At least they can sing what they record.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden is a remarkle group with raw talent and to put mildy  &quot;breaks the mold&quot;. Refreshingly not a cheesy boy band, or a  depressing gothic soundtrack, Darren Hayes fits somewhere in between. I'll  admit I wasn't crazy about their overplayed hit single &quot;I Knew I Loved  You&quot;, but the CD is a great buy. I admire the fact that they write  some of there own songs, because I realize how hard that is to do.  Something else I appreciate is the band duo don't just try to play pretty  boy to impress their younger female fans and seem real and unique. Great  alternative music sung by the voice of an angel. Please listen to this, if  not buy it. This CD is worth every penny of your money.
B00004XPP0|5.0|I think just about everyone over 5 years of age has seen a Star Wars movie, they're part of the culture now.  Star Wars Is (In my opinion) the  best In the trilogy, but ESB Is definetely the most Interesting - as earth  shatteringly spectacular Episode 1's lightsaber battle Is, It can't compare  with Empire's &quot;In the family&quot; shock fest: &quot;I am  your...&quot;  Well you know the rest.  Return Of the Jedi just doesen't  compare, It's practically the first film all over again with a new Death  Star, and more flashy effects (and those franchise fodder Ewoks!&quot;)  I  don't think we can really judge Episode 1 until we see Episodes 2 and 3,  then everything will make perfect sense.  And everyone seems to think the  Special Edition's practically trashed these movies, come on!  The Whampa at  the opening of ESB really gives a fuller picture, the Sarlac In ROJ now  looks a lot fiercer and Mos Eisley In Star Wars looks whole and complete.   OK, the Greedo and Han scene just came out looking stupid, but this hardly  scraps the film.  And lets face It, If you had created a masterpiece which  you weren't happy with (even If everyone else thought It was fine) would  you want to leave It the way It was?  Well that's really up to you, but  these are great films, even If the chances are you already have them In  another, less glossy packaging.  The Episode 2  featurette Is definetely  simply a sales hoarse which Is a bit shameless, but no doubt It will shift  millions of cassettes, and why not, we all want to see what's going on with  E-2.  (Although If they say this Is yet another limited edition, then I  really will get angry)
0792846338|4.0|I saw this film recently and loved it. The acting is great and the plot is  suspenseful and often chilling. Kathy Bates gives a convincing performance  as the obsessed fan of writer James Caans romantic novels. She rescues him  from a car accident and looks after him. But when he tells her he plans to  kill off his fictional character 'Misery', Bates changes from caring nurse  to complete &quot;crazy bitch&quot;. One of Stephen Kings more successful  adaptations.
B00004XPP0|3.0|well, i think star wars is the best movie of all time.  but,i am getteing sick and tired of waiting for them to come out on dvd.  if you're going to  make all these really cool special effects, and if you are going to make  the movie quality &quot;better&quot;, why put it on VHS? i think he should  concentrate on his new movie, instead of trying to make his old one  &quot;better&quot;.  i would like to know just what exactly is wrong with  the original movies.  yes, compared to the technology today, the special  effects are not as good, but that is what makes it so cool.  but i do have  to say, i probably will buy this.
B000003P9Z|2.0|I have been an Abba fan for years, and have Abba Gold which I love to  listen to and sing along with. I purchased More Abba Gold thinking it would  be as good in quality and recognizable songs; however, I was mistaken. I  found this album  poorly mastered, hard to hear, and did not recognize the  songs at all. As a matter of fact, I thought they all sounded about the  same. I am greatly disappointed with this CD.
0945353642|5.0|I have to say that &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; is one of my favorite  Christy's stories! It has everything: great characters and character/story  development, mystery, a very smart killer, surprising and unexpected  ending! I would recommend this book for anyone who's looking for a good  book to read. And believe me, you'll never guess the killer!
B00004W5UA|5.0|One of the best and most thought provoking movies of our time. David Fincher's directing never seizes to amaze. He pulls you into a world which is so distant yet so close to home. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton bring this  movie alive and you can't help but laugh at the parts involving Meat Loaf.
B000009CEM|5.0|Ive always been a big fan of Fear Factory. They can make the most of real  metal music and still get a little on the alternative side without becoming  a ''nu-metal'' type band. Obsolute lyrics remind me of Tools. The whole man  vs. machine type deal is all over this album. Very cool idea. Has great  messages. Messages like we should control technology and technology not  control us. The guitars are great. All in metals glory. The drumming is  fast paced and brilliant. My personal favorites are Edgecrusher, Descent,  Shock, and Smasher/Devourer. A great purchase worth for any metal fan out  there.
B000001FQ4|5.0|The first album to feature Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson features a  different sound that fans became acustomed to after the release of  Jailbreak. Thin Lizzy dives through many styles here. From the hard edge  sounds of &quot;It's Only Money&quot;, and &quot;Sha-La-La&quot; to the  beautiful overtons of &quot;Dear Heart&quot;, and &quot;Frankie  Carroll&quot;. A certain kind of jazz influence is apparent on the title  track, which is probably my favorite song on the album.  &quot;Showdown&quot; sounds like it was the theme for some night-time 70's  cop show. &quot;Philomena&quot; is a sweet song dedicated to Phil's mother,  and the short but sweet instrumental &quot;banshee&quot; is a cool treat.  So if you are a big Thin Lizzy fan and you don't have this. Buy it now, and  don't miss out on this great album!
B00000DC10|5.0|Refused is definetly one of the best, if not, THE BEST hardcore punk band  ever. The music is basically hardcore but they also go into this weird  techno thing. Kind of techno-jazz like thing. Its awesome. New Noise is  amazing. Makes Bawitiba look like well Bawitiba. The lead singer can  actually scream unlike most of the ''metal-heads'' today. If you like real  music Refused is for you.
B00000J7J4|3.0|Carlos Santana is a fine musician, but unless you are already in love with  him, you will wonder why the world has gone so wild over such an ordinary  album.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This low budget movie does a fantasic job introducing its characters and their histories.  The special effects doesn't get in the way of the story.   The shaking camera action is used a lot during movie, but if you watch  closely it actually enhances the movie experience.  The story isn't  original, but the presentation more than makes up for the movies  weaknesses.  Compared to other big budget SciFi movies, Pitch Black deliver  great visuals for its cost.  Star Wars' desert planet Tatoonie had two  suns, but it looked more like a normal Earth desert (which it was).  Pitch  Black created the effect of the three suns in a much more believable  visual.  Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser and Vin Diesel did a great job with  their characters, making them interesting enough to want to know more about  them.  If you're a fan of SciFi show FarScape, then you'll be happy to know  that Caudia Black is in the movie.  SciFi fans get suckered into seeing a  lot of awful SciFi movies (ie: Mission to Mars), but Pitch Black delivers a  SciFi experience worth watching more than once.
0060196122|4.0|At the end of this novel the reader is given the gift of a second chance  at life, but only if the reader dares to defy conformity and live according  to their heart's passion, assuming of course that the heart has a  recognizable passion.  That's the catch.  If you are satisfied with your  own mediocrity then I don't recommend reading this because you might just  find yourself identifying with Veronika, who never dared to take any real  chances or go against the flow, one day after another being that of mundane  existence.  You may in fact find yourself quite jealous of Veronika's  remarkable foresight when she analyzed the reasons for not finishing her  life, and then for having the calm courage to end her life of monotonous  conformity.<br />This book challenges you to examine the value of your own  life, and the cost of sacrificing whatever it is that is unusual about you  for the sake of acceptance by others.  If you aren't afraid of holding up a  mirror to yourself then read away, and enjoy the spiritual jewels the  authors lays at your feet.
0887307396|3.0|I'm not a business person, and don't willingly read business books.  Yet  this one has something to offer, even to me.<br />These boys go about their  research with serious intellectual integrity -- willing to let the evidence  destroy their hypotheses and starting over with new ideas -- they come upon  some deep and important truths about leadership.  For example:   Preserve the core philosophy, hold all else loosely.             Look for  ways to replace \\"either or\\" with \\"yes AND\\"             Be a clockbuilder,  not a timeteller.<br />Among other ideas.  I don't know if what is here is  profound in the business world, as I don't exist in the business world.    But it is often the simplest of simple truths -- the kind we tend to  overlook.  <br />I read this as part of a staff of a campus ministry, and  found it definitely helpful.  I think any leader of ANYthing will find it  helpful.  If I ever go into business, I'll come back to it.  There are no  \\"quick steps to success\\" or get-rich plans, there is simple a strong  philosophy of business clearly expressed.<br />As I said, the boys have done  their research, and are eager to show it.  The book bogs down when they  cite example after example of how their \\"visionary companies\\" have  illustrated the concepts they are putting forward --proving to me that  they're right, but testing my patience at the same time.
B000006MS3|5.0|Dark, chilling, misterious, haunting, GREAT! There are so many hooks in  this cd that everytime you listen you hear something new. Kate's beautifull  voice fits in very well. Sat In Your Lap is fantastic!! Other good songs:  The titletrack; that's one of the most chilling songs I ever heard,  Houdini; I like the picture in front of the cd very much, it refers to the  song, and Get Out Of My House; with all the different sounds and fantastic  dialogue. This cd is always a pleasure to listen!
B0000028RR|5.0|Zach De la Rocha's lyrics combined with Tom Morrello's guitar come  together to create one of the most ingenious albums ever put out in the  90's. Followed up by Rage's second album, Evil Empire, their self-titled  record is most likely the best debut record of any band I know.   If you're  looking for a good buy, this is the one to get, and you'll get your money's  worth.
0788812408|5.0|The Little Mermaid is,without a doubt,the best animated film of all time.It's a perfect mix of animation,character,story,humor,and music.The  first time I saw this animated masterpiece I instantly fell in love.I have  seen and own every Disney animated film and only this and Beauty and the  Beast do I find myself watching often.Ariel's story of dreaming to be human  is entertaining to the whole family and is a film nobody should be without.
B000002J09|2.0|I have a University degree too, and although I don't believe that only misfit drug addicts listen to Zeppelin, I have to say that the popularity  of this album has always mystified me.
B00004XPOZ|1.0|Lucas is at it again, getting the fans to buy more of the same thing that has already been released before. He has time to put these movies on video  but not DVD!  Using the scam once again by adding a tiny little extra  something or other to the set so you feel you have to buy it again. How  many times do we have to purchase these films? Are we the fans going to let  him get away with it again? Let Lucas see the errors in his ways and  realize that he can no longer take advantage of the fans for these films.  Wait for the DVD's.
B000002J09|5.0|My God. I had never heard of any of Led Zeppelins material before but I  bought this album. I put in in the CD player and 10 seconds later I was  utterly mesmerised. I only realised that the album had finished because  later I woke up from the floor. I realised later that I had fainted,  becaused the awesomely majestic music had literally had a devastating  effect on me.My very soul had been blasted. I was not religious before, but  I now believe in Our Lord because only He could have allowed something as  majestic as LED ZEPPELIN 1V on our world.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|You don't see too many submarine-movies anymore these days. I think that's a shame. I also think it's a shame u-571 isn't anything remarkable. It's  watching sweaty faces looking up as they hear their own sub collapsing  under the pressure for two hours. It's not  really about the crew or the  enemy, it's just about the submarine. And then there are some nice action  sequences and some passable 'thrills' and a forgettable climax with a bunch  of bangs and that's it.
0671027344|5.0|I read this book a while ago, but i was and still am blown away by it.  This is the most realistic book i have ever read portraying a freshman year of high school, which i just completed. Whether you are the most popular  person or the most shunned outcast, you can relate to Charlie as he tells  his mystery receiver about his day to day life.<br /> I actually read it right  at the end of my freshman year and as i looked back at my freshman year and  i was amazed at the honest reality of it.  i reccomend it to anyone who  *really* wants to know what a freshman year of high school is like.
B000002G60|4.0|Suzanne Vega returns with a great cd.  Many songs stand out in my mind but  most of all the single &quot; Caramel.&quot;  This song from &quot; The  Truth About Cats and Dogs&quot; soundtrack has a jazz influence to it and  is  a highlight on this cd.  Other highlights is &quot;World Before  Columbus&quot; written for her daughter, Ruby.  I also enjpy  &quot;Honeymoon Suite&quot; a song that seems to tell a story about her  husband, Mitchell Froom, and his contact with the spiritual world.  This CD  is a must for any Suzanne Vega.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|basically this is a movie about a bunker in the deep, never before (and hopefully after) has an u-boat been seen that could take more hits from  deepwater bombs and continius sailing on.. not to mention the rear nuke  they carry around.. one shot of that one could have killed anything. this  has to be the worst u-boat movie ever made.. If its the first u-boat movie  you ever see it might hold a suprise or two, but otherwise you will easily  be able to see what is going to happen the next 10 mins as the movie  progresses.
0783222955|5.0|It's rare that a movie is made that can capture the moods and feelings created in the book that it's based on.  Considering the success of the  novel To Kill A Mockingbird, producing a movie to match would seem like an  impossible task.  However, Gregory Peck is perfect as Atticus Finch,  turning out one of the best performances I have ever seen.  The children  are right on character and the movie is just enchanting.  I would highly  recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you read and loved the book.

B00000IYWH|5.0|Too many people refuse to admit that Elvis Presley continued to grow as an  artist after the '50's. This album is proof that he matured beyond the  level most people are lazy enough to remember him for. Many have cited  Elvis' willingness to sing questionable material and his sometimes tacky  taste in singers like Dean Martin.But it's precisely Elvis' inclusiveness  as a singer that makes him great--the fact that he managed to integrate  more strands of American popular music into himself than almost anyone  else. It was the wideness of taste that managed to include Dean Martin  which also included Lowell Fulsom. Elvis had excellent taste--the problem  was that it was too wide.     &quot;Elvis Is Back!&quot; is perhaps the  greatest example of Elvis' taste and integrative power--it features nearly  every pop form Elvis enjoyed. The wideness of his taste meant that he was  susceptible to the most sugary pop, like &quot;The Girl of My Best  Friend&quot; or the still-sweet &quot;Soldier Boy.&quot; There's also the  pop rock that made his name in 1956, although here sometimes in diluted  form(&quot;Stuck On You&quot;), along with the usual ballads--here sung  more powerfully than before but still with the usual senitivity of tone  that tells you a lot about the beauty of his voice and the genuine grace at  the bottom of his personality. There's also something new--the operatic pop  numbers he'd always been attracted to but now decided to dabble in. At  their most questionable they sound weird and turgid(&quot;Are You Lonesome  tonight?&quot;) and at best sound dramatic and thrilling.(&quot;It's Now Or  Never.&quot;) But the best part of the album is the blues. Every song in  the genre is sung here perfectly--you can feel the hair rise on your neck  stand up when he assays &quot;Reconsider Baby&quot; with such deadly cool,  or when he matches the saxophone on &quot;Like A Baby&quot; with sinful  intent. The most revealing part of the album--perhaps any of Elvis'  albums--comes midway. Elvis croons &quot;Soldier Boy&quot; with genuine  care and grace and ust when you think he is about to fully dive into pure  pop he suddenly lunges into the Drifter's &quot;Such A Night&quot;--which  concludes with one of the most pleasurably dirty bits of music I've ever  heard. Only someone as great as Elvis Presley can get away with following  the most treacly love song with a full-fledged orgasm.
B000001GQJ|5.0|This Liszt sonata knocked me flat when I heard it.  I was familiar with  the sonata before hearing Argerich perform it, but in her hands it is  something completely new.  Her performance encompasses all the aspects of  the music, from the rapid virtuouso flourishes to the serene beginning and  ending of the sonata.  Because of Argerich, the Liszt sonata is now one of  my favorite works for piano.  You simply must hear this.<br />The cd is called  Debut Recital, and that's what you get on the rest of the cd.  Argerich's  runs up and down the keyboard are seamless in her Chopin.  She makes it  seem as if the piano could never ever be a percussive instrument.  Of  course she throws in Prokofiev's toccata to take full advantage of the  keyboard's mechanical capabilities.  When I listen to how fast she plays  the end of the toccata, I wonder how it's even possible to play that fast.   Her fingers play the notes faster than I can think them!<br />There are of  course Argerich's detractors who believe that she is a brainless virtuouso  who plays fast just to play fast, or plays violently just to play  violently, simply because she can.  Horowitz's critic accused him of  similar &quot;crimes.&quot;  To fall into the same musical category as  Horowitz is never bad.  Yes, when Argerich plays, the music is as much hers  as it is the composer's.  And that is what makes her a great interpreter.   Every time she performs, she brings something new to the music.  Musical  performance should be anything but homogeneous.  If you want something  performed specifically the way Chopin wrote it, you can find that  elsewhere.  Look to Argerich, though, for pure originality.  You'll find  her innovative genius throughout this wonderful disk.
6304297912|5.0|Yes, this has some very disturbing scenes. That's the point. Some parts of it are downright disgusting. This is a great film that in no way glamorizes  drug use. <br />The script is moving, and the actors are terrific. <br />In  Trainspotting, we get to see inside the world of illicit drugs through the  eyes of heroin-addict Mark Renton. Instead of outright preaching to us, the  filmmakers strived to show reality, and let us decide for ourselves. There  are funny parts, but in most cases the audience is laughing AT the  characters, rather than WITH them. The film acknowledges that the high  experienced from drugs is a pleasurable experience (otherwise no one would  do it), however we quickly see that not everything is hallucinations of  rainbows.
B00000K19E|1.0|I bought this movie a while ago after hearing raves about it. But only last weekend did I get a chance to sit down and watch it in our well  equipped Home Theater. In an era where Jessie Ventura gets to run and win  an election, it is not surprising that movies of this type succeed. In  fact, I predict as the younger generation, with substantial exposure to  video game and TV depiction of gory and extreme violence, grows up - we  will find more and more such movies being favorably reviewed and possibly  even win Oscars ! The movie has great surround and special effects. But the  shocking amount of violence with no regard for life, while nothing unusual  for the teenage crowd, shocks me. I am a 37 year father of a four year old.  Dont get me wrong, I do enjoy special effect and surround sound, but the  violence has to make sense. Ok maybe thats asking too much in this day and  age. Want to watch a good movie with awesome special effects ? Try  &quot;Mouse Hunt&quot; ... its on DTS ! Another good one for sound and  video &quot;Super Speedway - IMAX&quot;
B000002HRE|2.0|First of all, I don't think of Metallica of a band that has sold out.  However, when you are as one dimensional as Metallica is, eventually your  creativity if gone. &quot;Load&quot; had its moments, but  &quot;Reload&quot; is bad. The best song is &quot;Low Man's Lyric&quot;.  There are several songs that have cool parts, but nothing on this cd is  what I would call a Metallica classic. Compare: Ride The Lightning has  probably 5 classics out of 8. Master Of Puppets has 8 for 8. AJ4A has 2 or  3 for 9. Black Album has 6 out of 12. Load 3 for 14. Reload bats .000. Like  I said before, this is a one dimensional band and you can only do the same  thing over and over for so long. Metallica is smart though, 'cause they  realize that is what sell. Examples of this include AC/DC and Aerosmith.
B00004WG28|5.0|As a younger person who's missed many of the &quot;older&quot; movies (like &quot;The King and I&quot;) I can only see movies for the works they  are -- I do not have older works in my repertoire through which to compare,  contrast and filter my viewing experience.<br />Having just viewed Anna &amp;  the King both in letterbox and cropped views (I prefer letterbox, though  smaller on a screen, the camera work and screenplay are absolutely  stunning, and missing these outer details does detract from the mood of the  picture), I greatly enjoyed the storyline, the actors, and the  cinematography.<br />Admittedly Jodie Foster's English accent is a bit forced,  but I commend her ability to retain it consistently throughout the picture  (as opposed to some actors who've been unable to do so, regardless, they  did receive outstanding reviews for their performance, nonnative accent  notwithstanding).  I felt Jodie's portrayal as being prim and well-educated  was very accurate given the time period -- what is considered acceptable  today would have been considered absolutely abhorrent in Anna's time.  We  seem to forget that so many things considered perfectly fine today, simply  weren't done in the mid-1800's, particularly in the ultra-traditionalized  societies like those of England and Siam (to name two).  American attitudes  have been long considered far fringe by non-Western societies around the  world, both then and today.<br />I found the choice of actors for Siam  characters to be appropriate and believable.  The character portrayals were  deep and true.  I felt as though I was watching people, getting to know  them, not watching actors playing roles.  The transitions of time and space  were effective and I didn't find myself yearning for &quot;missed  pieces.&quot;  <br />The love story caught me by surprise.  I found it deeply  moving and the tension between Anna, and the King, and the careful play of  the King's other wives, to be wonderful.  I strained to hear every word and  catch every expression.  I appreciated the dialog and found the scenes  well-written, appropriately succinct and yet adequately played to offer a  &quot;newcomer&quot; like me an appreciation of the many issues which  underlay the story.  <br />This movie tugged at my heartstrings, as I watched  these people and families grow and come to love together, and I was moved  to tears repeatedly.  Watching a deep love grow between Anna and the King,  a love borne of respect and intelligence and attraction, watching them  balance their societal dictates with the concerns of country, politics and  their feelings for one another -- and of course all those beautiful  children -- was like watching a gentle dance of butterflies on a summer's  breeze.  I felt it was beautifully written and beautifully played.  <br />I  give it a &quot;thumbs up&quot; for the actors, directorship, costuming and  cinematography.  Definitely a movie worth seeing!
B00004T9UF|4.0|This CD is a really good CD!! If you thought his last was good.. wait till  you listen to this! I've seen the other reviewers and what they have to say  about it, and i agree it ain't for kids! But if your mature enough to  actually not take what he says to heart then listen to this CD! You will  really enjoy it!
B0000060NF|5.0|Marvin Gaye is without a doubt one of the greatest singing talents to ever grace the sound of music. His lyrics are poetic, philosophical, and quite  simply, beautiful. I have no real way to describe this album other than to  say in the four years I have owned it I make it a point to listen to it  once a day. My day is not complete until I hear the sweet sounds of  &quot;Inner City Blues&quot; or the painful lamenting of &quot;What's Going  On?&quot; Marvin's message is loud and clear: &quot;come on talk to me, so  you can see, what's going on....&quot; Those words from the highly  emotional title track speak to generation after generation and screams that  violence is NOT the way! Love, peace, and great soul music from my favorite  singer of all time are the tools for a better future. Truly a concept album  in every sense of the word, &quot;What's Going On?&quot; should be one of  the albums that everyone on this earth should own, along with Johnny  Coltrane's &quot;Ballads&quot;, and Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall.&quot; An  album like this only comes along once in a million years, and it's luster  will never tarnish. Marvin Gaye was a beautiful human being, and he  literally poured out every emotion onto this record. When listening to a  concept album, one can usually see what is inside the artist's head. With  this album, we see Marvin's mind, soul and emotions. We laugh with him, we  cry when he sheds tears, and we get chills when he tells us of how simple  and free peace is. Marvin Gaye is not just an artist, he is the single most  important R&amp;B singer of all time. Out of respect for him, and his  evolution of soul music, you should own this record. Fans of hip-hop, soul,  R&amp;B, oldies, and pop will all love this masterpiece of finely crafted  music. Marvin has truly enlightened me and expanded my world of music. I  thank him so very much for creating, in my mind, the single most important  album ever created. Yes &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was influential, but  &quot;What's Going On&quot; was a different kind of influence. Not to open  your mind to drugs, and new experiences, but to open your mind to love and  peace. If only people had listened to his tortued voice the world might be  happier. Marvin's voice still brings tears to my eyes when I think of what  was and what could have been. I am so sorry for rambling, but please listen  to this record, I think that you will be extremeley satisfied. Don't just  listen to it though, LISTEN to it!ut  &quot;What's Going On&quot; was a different kind of influence.

6305907145|4.0|OK ! Let's get back to the classics. At least, you are sure that your ears won't be hurt by the today scatological vocabulary so praised by the new  generation of directors who thinks, by using the language of the streets,  that they are making modern films. How wrong ! The themes treated by Jane  Austen in MANSFIELD PARK are more actual and universal than the 90 % of the  Hollywood screenplays of the year 1999. And I'm still nice with the old  dream factory.<br />Jane Austen was a witty and sharp observer of the late  XVIII-early XIXth century period in England. She had the peculiar gift to  feel what was hidden behind the masks that society and the system of  classes gave to people at their birth. Her novels are little pearls of  psychology that until now have well stood the test of time. But what I  really appreciate in her books, it's the kind of black humor that reigns  through numerous pages of her work. Director Patricia Rozema has  particularly well translated in the cinema grammar this humor, specially in  the last 10 minutes of MANSFIELD PARK.<br />Three years after SENSE AND  SENSIBILITY with Emma Thompson, MANSFIELD PARK is another excellent  adaptation of a Jane Austen novel and can only arouse your envy to  rediscover the other novels of this writer.<br />A DVD for you and your  schoolteacher.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|It's a submarine movie. It's wet, horrible,and they get depth charged. The plot is pretty farcical, the much discussed Enigma is dispensed with in 30  seconds flat, but the cardboard-cutout characterisation is pitiful; That  bridegroom isn't going to get home to his new wife, gritty captains talking  of the need to gain command experience are clearly planning an early  retirement, and any keen youngsters called &quot;Trigger&quot; are  guaranteed a place showing up The Futility Of War. Matthew McConaughey was  less wooden as his previous role in a submarine movie; playing Troy Tempest  in Stingray. As a Brit crypto-geek, I expected to be horrified by the  disrespect shown to Bletchley Park. It's pure fiction though, and so far  from any credibility that I didn't care. The use of a US Navy seaplane in  the closing scene over the Western Approaches though, rather than a Coastal  Command Sunderland from Pembroke Dock, did strike me as a little  disrespectful though, and for no valid plot reason.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Usually, when an artist begins to mature (even if it's only a physical and surgical maturity as in Britney's case), so does the music. The now tired  trio Hanson, whom although I don't care to listen to AT LEAST played and  wrote their own songs, showed some progression in sound and style as they  grew older. With Britney however, what you've got is nothing less than  commercial and musical fabrication. Yes, she may look like a 35 years old  women now who spent most of her life hanging out in bars, but the music  still sounds as juvenille and stale as the Spice Girls &quot;Wannabe&quot;.  I understand that young girls need to have a role model they can look up  to, a kind of music that suits their age range, and a &quot;fantasy&quot;  of some sort which they can live in, but this is totally overdone and  Britney isn't quite setting the best example for these poor girls. What a  difference it would make in the mental maturity of today's girls if instead  of being encouraged to listen to some flake like Britney, they would listen  to someone like Charlette Church, whom is a 15 year old opera singer who  actually LOOKS HER AGE yet has an increadibly powerful voice that could  drown out even Britney's shrieks.<br />What's especially bad is because  Britney Spears is chosing to stay with this soon to pass pop trend, she is  limiting herself (not that I'm suggesting that she's capable of anything  more than this) to only being allowed to do this kind of music from now on  for the REST OF HER LIFE. However, what is she going to do when this kind  of music isn't popular anymore and her fans grow up? If she then tries to  change her style she will be accused of selling out and probably be laughed  at (even more than she is laughed at now). <br />Bottom line is I'm sick of  the real, hard working and talented artists being ignored by radio and the  media, while they promote this kind of trash instead and then call it  &quot;music&quot;. Oh well, I'll just sit back and enjoy the eventual  demise of Britney and watch her fall apart in the midst of her decreasing  popularity. I give this artist no more than 1 year before she's over.  Tic-toc, tick-toc, tick-toc ....
B00000IO4J|1.0|When this movie came out, I thought it was a cool idea for a movie and I wanted to see it, but somehow never got around to it.  Other people told me  the movie was O.K. but not all that great.  When I heard these comments, I  was still thinking I would like this movie because none of those people  were horror film junkies like I am.  Well, I rented it, and it turns out  they were wrong about this movie, but not in the way that I thought they  would be wrong.  The Faculty is much worse than the way I heard it  described.  In fact, it is an abomination.  It is truly awful, and ranks  (or shall I say &quot;reeks&quot;) as one of the worst movies I have ever  seen.  If you take out the swearing, this film is basically kiddie-horror.   The story is like one of those Goosebumps books that ten year olds read.   It is basically just your run-of-the-mill class nerd becomes big hero  movie.  It reminded me of a made-for-television movie, like one of those  ABC after school specials.  The fact that they make reference to Invasion  of the Body Snatchers in this pitiful movie is utterly ridiculous since it  is nowhere near being in the same league as that great sci-fi classic. I  would have given this movie 0 stars, but unfortunately that wasn't a  choice.  If you like Disney films, get The Faculty.  If you like horror,  don't bother.
6303114946|5.0|Too many people try to pass this film off as just a family picture, a story about a father and son, but it operates on so many other levels that  such an evaluation hardly does it justice.<br />I once spent an entire  evening, with a then film student/now film maker friend of mine, just  discussing the basic aspects of the movie (like character relations,  cinematography, the flow of the script, etc.).  We concluded that the  father/son story is really one of the more insignificant (still important,  just not /as/ important) themes of the movie.<br />Combine that with superb  acting from Kingsly, Fishburn, Mantegna, and the young Max Pomeranc, and  this movie should be required viewing for everyone of any age.  And let me  restress the fine acting from Pomeranc (who plays the child chess prodigy).   About the only other place you'll see a child act as well is in &quot;6th  Sense&quot;.<br />Get this movie today, and make all your friends and family  watch it.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.

B000002R48|4.0|Dream Theater's debut album could very well have been one of their best, but they are held back by mediocre vocalist Charlie Dominci. However, the music is excellent, as should be expected. Guitarist John Petrucci and drummer Mike Portnoy show that they were top musicians even early on, and that's not to discount keyboardist Kevin Moore and bassist John Myung. Choice cuts include \\"A Fortune in Lies,\\" \\"The Killing Hand,\\" \\"The Ones Who Help...,\\" and one of my favorite instrumentals, the legendary Ytse Jam. The only downside, besides  the vocals, is horrible production by the normally good producer Terry  Date. Don't start here, but definitely get this eventually if you're a fan.
B00004THAY|5.0|I live in Memphis.One perk of this unfortunate geographic challenge is the  legal dispute that forces BB King to perform at his original club on Beale  Street on rare occasions. The performance dates are not advertised far in  advance, so we locals have a chance to see a show. I watched BB from 6 feet  away last year. This album recapitulated some of that incredible  experience. It is hard to overestimate the impact of BB King on todays  music.<br />I have always been a Clapton fan (although he is not terribly  gifted in the vocal arena). In his words &quot;BB is my hero&quot;. This is  obvious on the CD, even the cover is a tribute- BB relaxed in the back of  the convertible with Lucille, Clapton is driving and having a great  time.<br />Despite Eric's prodigious talent, he is overshawdowed by the  relaxed yet vibrant delivery of the master. Track 10 &quot;When my Heart..  .&quot; Showcases BB's mastery, track 11 &quot;Hold on ...&quot; allows a  side-by-side comparison of the respective abilities.<br />Nevertheless, this  is now one of my favorite Clapton albums. I admire him for putting this  together. There may never be another album that links the Delta Blues to  modern rock with such style, grace, enthusiasm, and honesty.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall-The greatest album ever made.  Why?  Well, if the fact that it  has sold over 23 million copies since its initial release in December 1979  doesn't impress you, which it should, and the addition that it boasts one  of the most played songs on the radio of the 80's(Another Brick in the  Wall, Part Two), perhaps I can persuade you further into forking out any  sum of money to own this masterpiece.  First of all, you have Roger Waters,  the lyrical genius, basically running the show.  I can't claim that many  vocalists/bassists can make me laugh with lyrics like &quot;I need you to  put through the shredder in front of my friends&quot; when it's applied to  such a minor tempo.  Then there's David Gilmour.  The man can play guitar.   Need proof?  Comfortably Numb.  Rated the number four guitar solo by Guitar  World.  It's not the last time the man appears on the list either.   Exchanging speed for timing and executing each note with perfection, his  slow paced solos leave you begging for more.  Nick Mason and Richard Wright  complete the missing rhythm and melody to give you the glory known as Pink  Floyd.  The Wall will remain a timeless classic and attract newer audiences  with each generation to come.
B00003CWL6|5.0|The frustration of a man, that sees his life going wasted, feeling trapped, trying to gain back the lost time.<br />The frustration of a woman,  of the american woman who always looks for reasons to break down, erupt and  escape.<br />The frustration of the children that get raised by frustrated  parents. <br />America, you deserved this one. You better take a closer look.
6305095574|5.0|&quot;Evil Dead&quot; is without a doubt, one of the scariest horror films  of all time.  I watched it in the middle of the day and I was still  completely creeped out!  The basic story is about five college friends who  rent an old cabin for the weekend.  With a tape recorder and &quot;the book  of the dead&quot; they accidentally unleash evil demons and all hell breaks  loose.  The setting is so incredibly creepy with the old cabin in the  middle of the woods and the dark cellar and (you get the point)...I must  warn you though, this film is not for anyone that has even a little bit of  a weak stomach.  I have seen so many splatter films in my life and this one  is, without a doubt, one of the top five goriest movies of all time.  It  even received an NC-17 rating for the violence and gore.  But, if you can  handle it, go and buy this movie!  This is a MUST-HAVE for any horror fan's  collection...

0800179501|5.0|I was listening to the radio when Bananarama's &quot;Cool Summer&quot; was played and I had an instant flash back to Ralph Macchio riding his bike in  front of a schoolbus.  I realized that I was deeply missing one of my  favorite movies, &quot;The Karate Kid.&quot;  So that night I watched my  DVD and had the best movie experience that I have had in a while.  What an  incredible film!  It is so moving, exciting, and touching.  Why is it that  when a film truly moves audiences critics immediately say that it is  &quot;corny&quot; or &quot;manipulative?&quot;  I thought the point of art  was to arouse emotions and to teach universal truths.  By my definition,  this film is pure art.  Plus, I have a new found appreciation of Ralph  Macchio's portrayal of Daniel.  Not many actors can, or are willing, to  convey fear as he does.  His performance is very brave.  A wonderful film  for any one who is not too sophisticated to admit that they too yearn for a  world where &quot;figting is the last answer to a problem.&quot;
B000002UR7|5.0|This was my first Radiohead album and also my personal favorite. I  purchased this album in the fall of 1997, and even though It took a few  more listenings than usual to get into it, I found those repeated  listenings to be very rewarding. After finally purchasing and enjoying all  the Radiohead albums on many levels, this quiet classic still remains my  favorite. The first time that I heard &quot;Creep&quot; was on MTV's  buzzworthy countdown, and I was simply mesmerized and blown away by the  sheer emotion and and pain that went into that very melodious three and a  half minute masterpiece. I was reluctant on buying the album from then on  because of the mixed reviews that I got from this very website.  Now my  only regret is the fact that I didn't get this sooner.  For many of you who  adjusted your ears to the song &quot;Creep&quot;, you may be dissapointed  with this album at first, but have patience and you'll find that  &quot;Creep&quot; is far from the best work on here. My personal favorites  include &quot;Stop Whispering&quot;, the folky &quot;Thinking about  you&quot;, &quot;Anyone can play Guitar&quot;,  &quot;Ripcord&quot;,&quot;Prove yourself&quot;, and the quiet but  tear-jerking &quot;I Can't&quot;. If you are new to the band I would  recommend starting with &quot;The Bends&quot;, otherwise give &quot;Pablo  Honey&quot; a try because it showcases in my opinion Radiohead at their  emotional and artistic best. Also recommended REM's &quot;Automatic for the  People&quot;, and Black Lab's &quot;Your Body Above Me&quot;.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|How many times does Hollywood have to portray America as the world's saviours. Get real America, &amp; stop trying to rewrite history. I'm used  to Britain constantly being depicted as the bad guys in Hollywood but this  insult to British efforts in WW2 plays an astonishing naivety even by  Hollywood standards. U-571 is badly let down by some very poor acting &amp;  atrocious dialogue, particularly from Bill Paxton &amp; Harvey Keitel.  Especially laughable was that at one point Harvey Keitel refers to  &quot;World War One&quot;. Typical Hollywood simplistic view of the world.  Film is supposed to take place around 1942. They never referred to WW1 as  WW1 until well after both wars had finished. They called it the Great War  until historians came up with the idea of conveniently labelling them WW1  and WW2 but that was much later. In short if you fancy a couple of hours  tense action &amp; don't mind fiction being passed off as fact, then U-571  does the trick. But you may just end up feeling conned.
B00004U8H4|5.0|You're right; it ISN'T like the book; but if you stop comparing the two,  you have a movie that stands very well on its own.  I thought it was  hilarious.  These days, too many pseudo-intellectuals look for  &quot;meaning&quot; in a film.  I don't.  I go to the movies to be  entertained.  Period.  This film was extremely entertaining; full of black  humor and 80s references, the cast sparkled and the dialogue was excellent,  especially Bale's monologues about extremely cheesy 80s stars like Phil  Collins and Whitney Houston.  If you haven't read the book...or if you can  forget about the book...and you're a fan of intelligent black humor...see  this movie.  If you're easily offended by satire, see Runaway Bride  instead.
6300216268|5.0|I first saw this film in college in 1973 after a bad breakup.  A friend dragged me to see it because I was so depressed.  The opening scene almost  caused me to leave the theater because of all the &quot;sickos&quot;  laughing in the audience.  Of course, once I got the punch line, I was  laughing along with everyone else.  I came away from this film completely  uplifted and hopeful again, the glorious songs of Cat Stevens playing in my  head.  Although the clothing and hair look pretty silly today, the message  has more than stood the test of time.  I am a high school English teacher,  and I have shown this film to my American Lit classes on several occasions.   It generates some really interesting discussions about issues like the  Vietnam War, age, death, love, and youthful rebellion.  So many kids worry  about being accepted and meeting exactly the often cruel standards of their  peers.  This film shows them that it's okay to be unique, to march to their  own drummers, and to love people who may not meet the typical definition of  &quot;normal.&quot;  It's a very joyous, hysterically funny, happy, sad  film and will be one of my favorites forever. I can't recommend it highly  enough.
630179849X|4.0|Along with Clint Eastwood, John Wayne is the greatest on-screen cowboy of all time. This 1970 western film proves that and so does so many other  great movies he's starred in. &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; has plenty of action and  gun fights (The train robbery is especially fun to watch) and some of the  dialoge was hilarious. I've seen this about a million times and I still  like it. Go add &quot;Rio Lobo&quot;  to your western movie collection  today!
B00004XPP0|5.0|A SE made fan, I haven't been able to find the moves anywhere to buy them. Now that they are being re-released, I can finally buy them!  If you  don't know the story, it's simple: Farmboy meets princess and bad guy.  Makes bad guy good guy, kill very bad guy. Oh yeah, he loses his hand  somehwere in between. :)
B00000J631|4.0|This is, quite possibly, the best compilation ever.  You get just about  every variant of punk there is.  You get everything from punk jokesters  NOFX to ppolitical punkers Anti-Flag, from the scream and shout Offspring  to the ska of Less Than Jake, from the REAL punk of Rancid to radio  friendly blink-182.  One thing I love about this CD is, just about every  track rocks, and the ones thta don't are just 30 seconds, so no love lost.   And there's no continuity- you're constantly switching bands.  If you've  ever had any interest in any kind of punk music, you've really got to find  yourself a copy of this CD.  It's fun, it's punk, it's great.
B000001ELR|5.0|I LOVE IT LOUD, CREATURES OF THE NIGHT, KILLERS! WAR MACHINE even had the  honor to be a headbanging classic by Beavis and Butthead! After some stupid  albums (Elder, Unmasked, Dynasty) KISS has returned.
0380804557|4.0|Of all the authors that have come to be noticed in the last 10 years or  so, Neil Gaiman might just be the most acclaimed.  He wins awards all over  the place, and justifiably so - his collaboration with Terry Preachett,  Good Omens, is one of the best Speculative Fiction books of the 90s, and  his Magnum Epic, The Sandman, is praised as one of the best ever Graphic  novels series, and unlike most of the praises of this sort, it isn't even  slightly exagerrated.<br />Gaiman is also a very diverse author:  He writes in  many lengths - his latest book is a collection of short fiction, and he  wrote long novels (Neverwhere, Good Omens) and short ones(like this one) he  writes very adult material(Sandman) along with with stuff that can be  appreciated by people of all ages(Stardust again).  He writes Graphic  Novels, Scripts, Novels, Short stories and poetry.  He writes Horror,  Fantasy, both Urban and Fairy tale style and even Science Fiction and  mainstream fiction.  But most importantly, He writes well.<br />Stardust is a  testament for Gaiman's ability to write in a style that is both enchanting  and inviting.  His books are easy to read - they're not page turners in the  sense of 'Oh I wonder what's going to happend next'  but in the sense of  'Wow, it's already finished?'  It is effortless reading, but high value  ones.<br />In this little charming story, Gaiman's sense of humor and writing  abilities keep you reading as he tells you of witches, falling stars, and,  as allways, twists on the tale.  Gaiman has a maiden in distress story, but  this time, the lady is held captive by the Hero(!), who wants to bring her  as a present for his true love(!!).<br />Gaiman is one of the most exciting  authors around, and he rarely disappoints.  Stardust is charming tale which  one can't help but enjoy.
0312962118|5.0|This has to be the best book I've ever read.  As a matter of fact I've  read it about 4 or 5 times.  I highly recommend this to anybody who likes  historical intrigue.
6305508550|5.0|Though I don't work in an office environment, I still have to put up with idiots everyday.  This movie is right up my alley.  This movie plays on current stereotypes and cubicle horror stories to make you laugh until you  wet yourself (and I almost did).  I bought this movie for my father as a  birthday present becasue he does slave away in a cubicle and hates his  idiot boss.  However, amidst all the coffee and desperation, most of the  jokes could be expected a mile away, but that didn't stop me from watching  it again and again.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Never have I seen a movie so thought provoking, so intelligent, so dakr, or so funny. How did this movie get made, and by a huge studio like 20th  Century Fox? I have no idea. You're either going to love, or hate it. I  find however that 99.9 percent of the people who hate this movie feel it  was over their heads. It's not the type of flick you can watch, and keep  tracking of while you're flipping between football, or 'Taxi Cab  Confessions' on HBO. It requires your full attention. And it's not going to  spoon feed you all the answers. So take a cue from the film's narrator, and  take responsibility for your decisions, your actions, and your questions. A  movie that can be interpreted on so many different levels, it's chic, it's  stylish, and it has the balls to laugh at things some movies wouldn't even  touch. Testicular Cancer, Terrorism, underground boxing clubs, and  castration are just a few items this movie pokes fun at. A brilliant  satire, with quotable dialogue, fun and interesting characters, and a plot  that'll leave you thinking for days. Simply put, 'Fight Club' is the best  movie I've ever seen. And I think it's the first classic of the next  century. Long live Chuck Palahniuk and David Fincher!
B000002GEY|3.0|Opinions on this album vary widely: \\"It's a classic!\\" \\"It's a sell-out!\\"  At the time of its release, \\"Breakfast in America\\" was seen by some, this  reviewer included, as a decline from the band's earlier, more  \\"intellectual\\" and adventurous work. Their previous release, \\"Even in the  Quietest Moments,\\" with its hit single, \\"Babaji,\\" proved that Supertramp  could sell records. On \\"Breakfast,\\" they rode their unique style to its  commercial peak.<br />So how is it a decline? Everything a fan would expect is  here -- even the philosophical sentiments. If anything, it is  quintessential `Tramp, and the worst complaint one might level is that the  band seemed to have settled into a proven hit-making approach, rather than  extend themselves and take risks. There are no risks here -- even the  cutesy packaging, in comparison with their earlier, more \\"serious\\" album  covers, seemed to say that this was a collection of radio candy. <br />To  understand all this grousing, it may be helpful to keep in mind the era  into which \\"Breakfast\\" was released -- a time of increasing polarity  between \\"hit\\" radio and the \\"alternative\\" music of the day: punk rock and  new wave, which, for a short time, really *were* alternatives. Any  self-respecting, college-aged, art-school music critic *had* to disdain  \\"Breakfast in America\\" in 1979. Supertramp hadn't changed -- we had. <br />So  this album is not without merit; in fact, it's essential listening for  anyone interested in the band, if for no other reason than because it was  such a huge seller. They had found their formula for success, pushed all  the right buttons, and wound up selling a ton of records.<br />If they had  \\"sold out\\" to anything, it was to their own Supertramp-ness.
020530902X|5.0|Would recommend to anyone that is always worried about witting e-mails, proposals, business documents, even reviews for Amazon.com. English might  be easy to speak at times but writing it is not as simple as I thought.  This little reference book has been a very good guide for the past couple  of weeks. Read it at least once every other month, so that writing basic  documents should not be a problem.
B00004XPOZ|2.0|While I truly believe that these are three of the best films ever made, this video release serves little or no purpose aside from sucking more  money from fans.  The Star Wars Trilogy has been released in more different  editions than any other movie series, and this release is being made only  to capitalize on the excitement for Episode II (the 10 minutes of bonus  material previously unreleased).  I believe that Lucasfilm should  &quot;double their efforts&quot; to produce DVD editions of these films,  rather than produce countless video editions while claiming they have no  time to spend on DVD projects.
B00004TA41|5.0|These duets are astounding. Everything is reduced to the basic element -  SOUND. There are themes and there is rhythm but what counts is the flow of  sound. Rashied Ali is a remarkable player deserving wider recognition  (check out the Gayle, Parker, Ali CD Touching on Trane).<br />Its hard to  beleive music with such strength and vitality came from a man who in a few  short months would lose a battle with cancer.

0790743132|5.0|There are moview that are timeless because they could have happened anywhere and at any time. This is not one of those.  This movie marks a  very specific point in time for both the period of the movie, and the  target audience.  A war movie, made in the middle of the war it portrays,  obvious good guys, obvious bad guys, and in the middle all the rest of us.   We all know Casablanca is doomed.  We know the history.  And because of  that we enjoy the small, silly, triumphs of individuals.  We cheer the  partiots, we smile at the corruption, we love Rick, and we wish it could  have somehow turned out differently.  At the same time we know it holds  true.  People do separate in war.  Some things are more important than  ourselves, and at the end we can wonder just what that relationship that is  starting could possibly be like.<br />To paraphrase - Of all the movies in all  the world why did I pick this? ... This one could very well be the best.
B000002WYT|5.0|If you want beautiful, genuine music and an escape from all the boy and  girl bands (britney and M &amp; M), then definitely give DMB a try. His  voice and music sound very original and to me it's very easy listening.  <br />Personally, my favorites are &quot;say goodbye&quot; and &quot;cry  freedom&quot;
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is usually considered the best rock album of the 90's and  there's a reason why.  Kurt's masterful song writing and sometimes painful  but always awsome sounding voice come together perfectly to create a  musical masterpiece.  Nirvana's sound is basically grunge band perfection.   Fred Durst has said before that the best music is made by bands in their  garages that are never discovered by the general public.  Nirvana is one of  those great garage bands that we were fortunate enough to discover.   Anyone, especially if they call themselves a rock fan, who doesn't find  Nevermind to be one of the best albums to ever be made (ok I admit  Metallica's Black Album was the best album of 1991, but Nevermind is a  close second) needs to just rip their ear drums out now, or at least quit  listening to music. Put simply, Nevermind is rock music at it's finest.   The only thing that makes it hard to listen to Nirvana is knowing that the  world will never again get to hear a new song from Kurt and Co. RIP Kurt.
B000002J09|5.0|Don't buy this album for &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; a song everyone  has heard 2 million times. That's not disparaging a great song, but enough  is enough already. Listen to this album for another reason; because it  contains Zeppelin's greatest ballad by a wide margin, &quot;Going to  California.&quot; Page's acoustic guitar work is understated and brilliant  here. The lyrical content of the song is also among the best the group ever  did. Plant's vocal is a thing of beauty, no wailing, no garbled words you  can't understand, just majestry.<br />It's impossible to add anything new to a  review of such a towering and groundbreaking album. It is taut, mesmerizing  and amazing. It belongs in any serious (or not-so-serious) musical  collection.
0679777547|4.0|A historic , well-written, intelligent and sophisticated novel will be  always a pleasure to read. In fact, Pérez-Reverte did a very good job  building excelent scenarios and characters with a good  structure.<br />However, something is missing to make this novel a classic. I  think is the power of writing, the precision of precisely Dumas, the  author´s alter ego .<br />Event that, The Club Dumas is a vey worth  reading.<br />I do not write anything about the translation beause I read it  in Spanish.
158234082X|4.0|As a working professional chef, and a CIA graduate, I thouroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish.  Yes, he dwells too much on his and others  drug habits, but they are a very real part of the business, day in and day  out.  I howled out loud with laughter at some parts of the book, and nodded  my head at others, knowing exactly what he was trying to say, even if it  was directed only to those of us who have made the restaurant business our  life.  I sent this book to my mom and dad with a note stating that this is  what my life has been like, only without the heroin and cocaine.  The  stress, the burns and cuts, the mentality of cooks digging in for the siege  at Khe Sahn, they are all very real, and not just in New York.
0671042858|3.0|If I hadn't been given the novel as a present I probably wouldn't have  picked it up in a while, but I believe that Stephen King has written much  better novels than this one. He is characterized by being a master of  terror, but there wasn't almost any terror portrayed here as in other,  usually older, novels of his. Though I guess it would be fine for younger  readers. So they won't be scared off too soon by King and dare to read his  novels further.
B00001QEE2|4.0|Yes, I was a tad disappointed the first time I saw Disneys Hercules.I'm not a big fan of Gospel Swing music, and the animation struck me as being  somewhat minimalist and cheap looking.And Megs a bitch! But after it came  out in video form I wound up watching it a few more times and the movie  just *grew* on me-I enjoyed it's spontanety, it's toungue-cheek-humour and  most of all-James Woods marvelously evil Hades-the best Disney villain  ever. After the Herc cartoon  series premiered-{and the cleverness of the  movie is tripled in the series-I strongly recoomend you catch up with this  animated gem of a cartoon show}I and my kids enjoyed the movie even more.  Yes-there are discrepencies-of course-yes-they put the myths in a blender  and hit the Puree button-But-who cares? Its good, clean original clever fun  for the whole family. And its NOT Pocahontas!

0440219078|5.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is an AWESOME book.  I was assigned to read it for my Freshman Pre-AP English class.  It was kinda slow in the beggining but  after about 10 pages I couldn't put it down!   This book really opened my  eyes to how horrible it would be to not be able to chose anything and see  absolutely no color!  I even shhhed my mom a few times while I was reading.   On a scale of 1 to 5 I give it a 10.  It is a MUST READ!   I know that it  deserved every award it recives!

6304340486|1.0|Cobra (1986)<br />Cobra is a God awful movie that really sets the standard for lousy action films.<br />The story is strange and goes absolutely  nowhere.Some killer called &quot;The NightSlasher&quot; kills multiple  people with a very sharp and lethal knife.Marion Cobretti (Sylvester  Stallone) is also known as &quot;Cobra&quot;,and sets out to destroy the  &quot;NightSlasher&quot;.<br />This film is sooo bad it's kind of hard to  describe.The  screenplay (written by Stallone) is horrible,and has tons of  plot holes and has unbelieveably stupid dialog.The story goes absolutely  nowhere.The characters are terribly developed and are strictly zero  dimensional.And Brigette Nielson is a horrid actress.<br />Beyond that,Cobra  is filled with an incredibly cheesy and  irritating 80s  soundtracks.Director George Pan Cosmatos has to be the most serious problem  with the film.He doesn't know where he wants the film to go,and his  direction is just soooo  weak,it makes the film predictable,slow,and  boring.<br />Cosmatos gave us some really good films over the years (Rambo 2,   Leviathan,etc),but this is probably his worst film.<br />Cobra is also very  boring due to the slow-paced plot and Cosmatos' incredibly weak  direction.The action scenes are also very stupid and brainless.Such as when  Cobra nukes two axe- wielding killers at his home and his boss and fellow  cops say he still doesn't have proof that the killings are being done by  more than one person.Cobra's sunglasses are also horrible   looking.<br />Overall,Cobra could've been a good movie.It could've been a   Stallone favorite.It has VERY few redeeming qualties.Brian Thompson is  excellent as the &quot;NightSlasher&quot;,the finale is pretty intense,and  the beginning is superb.Still,that can't  save this dreck.<br />It's easy to  see why Cobra 2 was never planned.This movie stunk up the house real bad!
0380002930|3.0|It's a pretty good book, but I agree July 30 reviewer. You shouldn't  insult or put down people who don't like this book. They have a right to  not like the book.

0425173895|4.0|This book was excellent- it has suspense, plot,  and all of Agatha  Christie's ingredients for a great mystery! Poirot is super, and the  murderer seems that it could be anyone in turn. But for me, the ending was  a bit too much.
0553573403|5.0|this is an excellent book, I suggest that you pick up a copy of this book  immediately.  It is definetely one of the best books I have ever read. I  can't wait for the rest of the books in the series to be released.
0316777722|4.0|Don't ask me why, but I read a few of the stories from this book in the bathroom at work. Which wouldn't have been a problem had I not had to worry  about others who were also using the bathroom at the same time. I know that  had it been me that walked into a bathroom and heard muffled laughing  coming from a closed stall, I'd have been pretty concerned for its  occupant. To which I say to anyone who might have been there, or could  imagine being there, I dare you to read any three of Sedaris' latest  stories and not laugh outloud. Embarrasingly loud. Let he who is without a  sense of humor cast the first stone.<br />Like Naked, Holidays on Ice and  Barrel Fever, MTPOD is riotous fun with a good bit of scathing social  commentary thrown in for good measure. Almost every story is a classic in  its own way, from the bathroom humor of Big Boy, to the foul-mouthed  sentimentality of You Can't Kill the Rooster. The second half of the book,  mostly stories of Sedaris' move to France, is a change of pace from the  remembrances of his North Carolina upbringing which make up most of the  first half, but doesn't disappoint at all. Picka-Pocketoni, Jesus Shaves  and the title story are wonderfully drawn and Sedaris writes comically  without being a comedian. <br />I read this book to my in-laws on vacation  recently. Every night, before we'd go to bed, I'd read a couple stories to  put a humorous ending on another day at the beach. I like to think that  they just like to hear me read, but I know the real reason everyone  gathered every night was the feeling a Sedaris story leaves you with. Is  there a more sure way to go to bed with a smile on your face. I'm not sure  there is. I can't give a book of humor five stars, but I can highly  recommend this offering by David Sedaris. Just don't read it in the  bathroom at work.
0784011206|4.0|Before I saw &quot;First Blood&quot;, I thought it would be a stupid Action movie, you know the typical &quot;good and bad&quot; cliches and a  lot of pointless shootouts. I was certainly wrong. Stallone isn't a good  guy at all, he doesn't safe any poor widows from evil villans like  Van-Damme loved to do in a bunch of terrible movies, he rather seems tragic  and confused, I think he really got an Actors part in this movie. Although,  there are a lot of weak points in this movie ( 1.I think the message that  this movie intends (?) to deliver doesn't come across that clearly 2.The  Policemen are actually more stupid than the Victims in any &quot;Friday the  13th&quot; movies, just take that one scene where the evil sherrif's car  gets crashed because HE DROVE DIRECTLY INTO A PILE OF STONES! 3.I always  knew there is a tunnel-system in the forest but nobody belived me... ) I  think it is better than most people expect it to be. It manages to make you  think a little, and that is by far more than I expect from an action-movie.  They had to make two sequels that are exactly what I thought this film  would be, avoid them and give this one a fair try!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Dysfunctional family ordeals and a sinking American dream of the ideal life has constantly appeared in films like Lee Ang's THE ICE STORM and now  the AMERICAN BEAUTY. The film is one of the most artistically accomplished  - silent and naunced - dissecting each character like peeling the petals of  the rose. Kevin Spacey is unequivocally the scene-stealer with stealthy  emotions - from a deranged husband, a triumph and a tender father - his  expression shows it all. Annette Benning is energized as the money-grubbing  wife Carolyn who is disillusioned by the pursue of money. Voyeurism and  homosexuality is reflected with clear-cutting honesty. <br />The exquisite  thing about the movie is that it holds surprises - and it is not overblown.  It taps into the secret heart of many like Lester in search of his wasted  life back. He sees his daughter's friend (Mena Suvari) as the part of youth  remote from him; the love in Carolyn long lost to the American dream of  riches and glory and his daughter Thora Birch is alienated from him  altogether. The characters are dimensional - each has his story to tell -  the weird neighbour played by Wes Bentley despite his mental history is  ironically the most astute of all. His family is shattered by a disgraced  father and a silenced mother. The tragedy is heartfelt and poignant.  <br />Boosted by a haunting score and a screenplay from Alan Ball, Sam Mendes  injects this film with exquisite beauty. It is textured and invites the  audience to look closer into the deep psyche of the characters as well as a  hovering reflection of their own inner hearts. American Beauty evokes  innocence and an understated tone of maturity in the script. Despite all  its harsh ugliness inside, it is indubitably the most savagely tender and  beautiful film in recent times.
B00000IPAX|1.0|This is pop in it's truest form!  It's down there with your boy  band-britney spears-christina aguilera trash!  The sad thing is that their  older stuff was actually decent before they became total sellouts with this  awful stuff.  <br />OK....many people have different opinions about music and  I respect that, and if you do like Blink 182 then i will respect your  opinion ONLY if you admit that Blink is a huge sellout and NOT PUNK!<br />If  you are curious as to what actual punk sounds like check out the Dead  Kennedys, Government Issue, Chaos UK, Subhumans, Casualties, and TSOL
B0000026T4|4.0|For the master of great seventies songs on teen rebellion, Cooper has been far ahead of his for a while now.  On this disc, Alice style is a hard rock  heavy metal kind of crunch that works well now and was the stuff back in  the late eighties when this album was released.  This is Alice's sick and  twisted obsession with sex and love.  Sure his wife must have loved this  one.  It's Alice raw and reenergized with a commercial rock sound that  helped place him back on top of the charts.<br />By far the best known track  is the sinister &quot;Poison&quot;.  The track focuses on a girl whose love  is deadly, but the song is the killer.  It's awesome heavy metal with hard  pounding drums that really make the song.  That's what a great rock song  should be.  I think the guitar riffs work pretty successful too, but it's  the skins that come right before the chorus that kick the song to another  level.  Not only one of Alice's better numbers, but one of my favorite  metal numbers of the eighties.  Competes with great Ozzy material.  <br />A  sick obsession with sex continues on the S&amp;M of &quot;Bed Of  Nails&quot;.  With an spooky intro ala Cooper this song is very dark at  first but then typical rock shouts and guitar sounds make the song tame  again but with a near ghostly cooing in the background.  Teenage rebellion  is in play with a retro rock feel of &quot;I'm Your Gun&quot;.  Cooper gets  very sensitive on &quot;Only My Heart Talking&quot;.  Very into the  beautifully sensitive rock feel of &quot;Only Women Bleed&quot; but with a  slight hard eighties sound.  It's also kind of Country.  A cool departure  for the full on rock album.  Steven Tyler makes a very vocal cameo on the  song and Aero pal Joe Perry lets it rock on &quot;House Of Fire&quot;.  It  has a boring intro evolves into something very cool with a stadium  chantable chorus.  &quot;Trash&quot; features John Bon Jovi a little in the  chorus and the sound is kind of like the groups hard New Jersey rocksound,  but luckily Cooper's screeching vocals and just mean spirited lyrics give  it that classic sense of the album.<br />This is a very welcome return for  Alice back onto the top of the charts.  I really like a lot of his  Seventies hits with that great writing that could be bluntly cruel,  honestly inspiring or soulfully sympathetic.  All of these come off on this  big selling blockbuster.  I don't know if Alice was after a really big hit  but with a fun eighties rock near cliché sound, he got it with a smash in  &quot;Poison&quot; and a pretty well known album.  I like the full album  and fans of eighties rock like Bon Jovi and others will love it.  As for  me, I really like this sound done by Alice but would really like to hear  more of his classic rock from the seventies after this set.  I'm sure it's  even smarter.
B00000IB4D|5.0|I first heard this LP many years ago, and the soulful rhythms and  spiritual lyrics made a lasting impression on me; it became one of my  favorite Santana albums.  I have this record on LP, and my cassette tape is  pretty worn out.  I have looked for this record on CD for a long time.   Favorites are Love, Devotion, Surrender; Welcome, When I Look Into Your  Eyes.  Definitely one of his best - finally available on CD!!
B00003CWTH|5.0|The movie starts disjointed and I had a hard time following it.  I almost decided after fifteen minutes to not watch it.  My wife did give up  watching it.  I had a hard time following the characters until I was well  into the movie.  <br />I've noticed lately, within the last couple of years,  that my first response is not always my most long-lasting response.   Magnolia grew on me for several days until I watched it again.  Seeing the  movie the second time was better because I already knew the story line and  could pick up on small things.  <br />Overall, Magnolia is about living life  in a very complicated world.  &quot;You may be done with the past, but the  past may not be done with you.&quot;  &quot;It won't stop until you wise  up.&quot;  There are no guarentees but there are paths.
0399231919|5.0|This is a cute and fun book.  I don't usually choose Eric Carle books, but this is one of the best books I've read to my almost-2 year old this year.   Even my 5 year old likes it.  Fun, imaginative, and we really like the  little face on Little Cloud in the beginning of the story.  This  small/medium board book size is a plus, too, easy for little hands.
078322608X|4.0|If you are a Bruce Willis fan this is a good movie, if you are a Brad Pitt fan this is a GREAT movie. Willis plays a convict from the future who is  sent into the year 1996 to find the individual(s) responsible for  unleashing a virus that will eventually kill most of the worlds population.  In the past he meets up with a mental patient whom he believes is  responsible for the disaster(Pitt). Madelaine Stowe plays the psychiatrist  who is treeting Willis, after all who wouldnt think this guy is crazy.   First off, Willis more than holds his own is his role but it is Brad Pitt  who steals the show. He is convincing enough in his portryal to make you  believe his is really mentally disturbed. He also lightens up the  overwhelmingly dark mood of this movie. The only problem I had with the  cast was Madelaine Stowe who was as about as exciting as a bag of  rocks.<br />The plot keeps you interested throughout the film. The visual  aspects of the film actually lead to believability. You get the impression  that if people fell off the face of the earth, things would look exactly as  they are portrayed. The sound on this film is excellent and your rear  surround speakers actually get some use! The DVD comes with a documentary  that is somewhat interesting, but the extras dont seem worth the extra  price. Some additional footage would be appreciated. Overall it is a great  science fiction movie that is a worthy addition to any DVD collection.
6305905401|2.0|Where did they go wrong?  This movie had a decent cast, a pretty good premise, and some tried and true creative personalities behind it. I was  wondering how Roman Polanski had directed the scenes in New York (as he is  permanently ruled off from revisiting these shores due to his indiscretion  with  a minor a couple decades back). Now I learn through a review that the  New York scenes were filmed in Europe (well that explains that!).<br />  It  is sad to see how Polanski has slipped, if this film is any indication of  his present-day creative ability. He historically has had an eye for a  script and the energy needed to pull off an idiosincratically appealing  interpretation of whatever text he has chosen to take on. This can be  verified by recalling the major films he has directed: &quot;Knife in the  Water,&quot; &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers,&quot;  &quot;Macbeth&quot;(his paean to his recently deceased wife, Sharon Tate)  &quot;Repulsion,&quot; &quot;Chinatown,&quot; &quot;Rosemary's Baby.&quot;  Not a bad list by any stretch of the imagination. That he should be reduced  to producing and directing such an unimaginative, trite, hackneyed (want  any more synoyms?)  piece of tripe as this is dissapointing and sad to one  of his fans (of whom I still count myself).<br />The plotline has been done  beyond death in recent cinema. There is absolutely nothing original or  fresh on display here. I kept searching for a quirk in character or plot  that would justify my expectations, but sadly none was forthcoming. The  only thing that truly amazed me was how much Frank Langella now resembles a  slightly younger Gore Vidal. He seems to have somehow morphed quite  successfully actually (due to some Satanic pact? Maybe Gore actually sold  his soul to replace the younger Langella?). Emmanuel Sanger (Polanski's  current wife) is an example of cinematic nepotism run rampant. She has got  to be the most wooden, untalented actresses since Marion Davies, and was  cast by Polanski for the same reasons as Hearst insisted on. Her most  intense scenes involve the camera focusing in on her cosmetically altered  eyes engaged in some sort of demonic stare, which ends up looking  incredibly risible, more appropriate to Comedy Central than spine-tingling  horror. The stare serves as a fairly appropriate meatphor for the film as a  whole. There is not a moment of apprehension, much less true horror, about  it. Nothing spooky, nothing chilling, nothing weird... just banal images of  repetetive and unbelievable figments of a poor screenwriter's paltry  imagination.<br /> I hope that this film doesn't signal the true eclipse of a  creative and dynamic filmmaker. Other important directors had their share  of clunkers. I hope this is just another example of a bump in the road to  an otherwise significant career.Polanski for the same reasons as Hearst insisted on.

B000002JEV|5.0|The music on these cds is incredible. Led Zepplin was a loud, heavy, swaggering, dynamic musical juggernaught. Their very essence is captured on  these two discs taken from a British radio concert in 1971. The band is at  the peak of it's powers here, Plant's howling passionate vocals, Page's  masterful guitar and otherworldly bow solos, Jones' rock solid basswork and  molar rattling blues organ, all being threatened with annihilation in front  of a detonating John Bonham. His thundering, ferocious drumming is on full  display here, it truly was the heart and soul of Zepplin. Highlights  abound, check out the polite, if not tepid crow response to an early  performance of the future rock anthem &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;! The  band burns through incendiary versions of &quot;Black Dog&quot;,  &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, a passionate  &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;, extended takes of &quot;Dazed and  Confused&quot; and a fantastic &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; highlighted by  an lengthy medley of blues standards halfway through. This is an absolute  must for all Zepplin fans, and is highly recommened!
0380804557|5.0|Like a miniature Faberge egg, this glittering little gem contains all the  right pieces in a beautifully-assembled package. Tropes, characters, and  situations from the gamut of legend and fairytale populate its pages, and  the familiarity of these elements gives the reader a little thrill of  discovery each time they appear. And like any good fairytale, it offers a  &quot;happily every after&quot; ending... but with a bittersweet  epilogue.<br />This book was marvelous fun to read, drawing on a rich canon of  fantastical literature. And as always, Gaiman's deceptively simple,  inimitably gorgeous prose leaves the reader breathless.
B000024QML|3.0|&quot;Very&quot; was a departure for the Pet Shop Boys.  After the mournful, melancholic &quot;Behavior,&quot; &quot;Very&quot; shows their  more playful, lighthearted side.  It has been acclaimed as a pop  masterpiece since it was released, and Rolling Stone deemed it  one of the  essential releases of the '90s.  I have to disagree, but only a little.  &quot;Very&quot; is a good record, with several witty, intelligent,  brilliant songs--but, for me at least, something's missing.  The first five  tracks are absolutely fantastic, some of Tennant and Lowe's finest work,  but the sixth, &quot;Yesterday When I Was Mad,&quot; leaves me cold, and  from then on, with the exception of &quot;The Theatre,&quot; the record  never rises above pretty good for me.  &quot;One and One Make Five&quot;  has a nice house groove and the hi-NRG &quot;One in a Million&quot; is  fairly exciting, but &quot;Very&quot; lacks the end-to-end first rate  material of &quot;Behavior&quot; or &quot;Bilingual&quot; or  &quot;Nightlife.&quot;  I've never liked &quot;Young Offender&quot; or even  the Village People cover, &quot;Go West.&quot;  What is good on  &quot;Very&quot; is among the Pets' very best, but there are some stylistic  throwaways here that are less than compelling.  &quot;Very&quot; is still a  fine album, and let's face it: Pet Shop Boys on a bad day are vastly better  than most bands on their best day.  For me, the follow up to  &quot;Very,&quot; &quot;Bilingual,&quot; was the Pet Shop Boys' finest  hour.  You can order it at Amazon.co.uk, because for some reason it isn't  available here.

B00004U30D|5.0|Many people have denounced this movie because of its supposedly undeserved praise at the Academy Awards and in part for the ugly rumors that  circulated as to why it garnered so much exultation. I remember reading  that one person was angry because so many beautiful films that were  nominated, containing deep and intriguing subject matter, were snuffed for  a self-absorbed screenplay portraying a dark and perverse white suburbia.  The film is not about this, and is far from any other dismaying assumptions  people might have made. It is about what each of us perceives as beautiful  in our own eyes, be it purely physical or the beauty we find in each other  deep down in the pit of our fragile souls. It is about being thankful for  the priceless gifts bestowed upon us and finding splendor in the simplest  of things in our every day lives. It shows us that image can only take us  so far before the truth about our personal nature must be revealed and the  consequences we suffer when we dishonor that truth.<br />I'll admit that I was  slightly disappointed upon my first viewing of the movie because of its  incomprehensible and climactic ending. However, upon continual viewings, my  interpretation of it began to change, and I realized why its writer chose a  tragic finale. I saw what message it was trying to convey to its every  viewer, and I felt profound sorrow upon realization of the amount of  ignorance in our world, yet I had a sense of hope. Granted, the film  possesses good amounts of acerbic banter and biting humor to avoid being  completely grave, but its overall message behind the mature and sardonic  jokes is all too significant and more optimistic than some seem to think.  The moral I pulled from it is this: Recognize what is important, because in  the blink of an eye, it could be gone. Life is short, rough, but priceless.  Don't go through it with a narrow mind, either. Open your eyes to  everything around you and force yourself to take a deeper look. There's  something beautiful in every single thing we see, no matter how it appears  at first glance. And no, it doesn't matter what kind of person you are, you  can see anything as long as your heart is open to it.<br />  Now that I'm  past the fight for artistic recognition, I'll move on to the stellar  performances that this film boasts. Let's start with our main attraction:  Kevin Spacey. Is there anything this man can't do? The first time I ever  saw him was in the eerie portrayal of the sly and sanctimonious serial  killer John Doe in &quot;Seven&quot;, co-starring w/Morgan Freeman and Brad  Pitt. He continued to impress with debonair bits as the smug prosecutor  Rufus Buckley in &quot;A Time To Kill&quot;, and as Jim Williams, the rich  Southern playboy with a dark secret in &quot;Midnight In The Garden Of Good  and Evil&quot;. But compared to the pessimistic and sardonic persona of  Lester Burnham, I've never seen such an entertaining or more realistic  character portrayed. Lester is the epitome of the middle-aged American  male: 40-hour week job at a boring, sanity-consuming marketing firm  involving telephone promotion run by a self-concerned, money-minded CEO.  There is a dark haze over his satisfaction towards his marriage and his  life, the opinions of his wife and daughter laying waste to his crumbling  self-esteem. It is in the moment that he lays eyes upon Angela Hayes' (Mena  Suvari, the perfect ditz) glamorous visage that his ultimate awakening from  his half-dead life begins to blossom like the rose he envisions. Angela  becomes his obsession, and in his obsession he gains a new appreciation for  himself and revives his fleeting youth.<br />  Now for Annette Bening - great  airhead! She's the perfect bitch when the situation calls, but aside from  Carolyn's constant henpecking towards Lester, she's an insecure and  melodramatic woman on the brink of insanity. She too suffers from the  maddening simplicity of every day life, seeking her comfort in her social  status and professional success. She eventually pursues her cure in the  odiferous arrogance and professional guidance of real estate mogul Buddy  Kane, a man with equal insecurities who cleverly conceals them behind a  Mentadent smile and pricey designer suits.<br />Watching from the sidelines  with a constant sneer and a quiet, festering hatred for her parents is the  self-loathing Jane (Thora Birch). I remember Thora from films that catered  to a younger generation, notably the portrayal of a young Melanie Griffith  in &quot;Now and Then&quot;, and the endearing Dani in &quot;Hocus  Pocus&quot;. She has grown into a talented woman with the magnificent  performance she gives in this movie as Lester and Carolyn's pessimistic  teenage daughter. She befriends our beloved, self-involved Angela, hanging  among Hayes' pungently supercilious aura with not a care for her own image  until Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), her new next-door neighbor, fosters an  innocent obsession towards her. The infatuation soon blossoms into a  delicate romance, deep and meaningful. In their love for each other, you  see the modern cliches of America's definition of beauty melt away into a  more profound look at the human soul and all of life surrounding it.<br />  This movie is an excellent character study and a delicate look at what lies  in the human heart. I would like to remind those that didn't really  understand the content and gave it poor reviews because of their  incomprehension that misunderstanding is the most common reason for  disliking. I beg of you to watch this film again with an open mind,  disregarding the somewhat strange anecdotes and scenes that were chosen to  remain in the film, but with good reason.

0140186409|5.0|This book is as wonderful to read now as it was when I stumbled across it  some 20 odd years ago.<br />If you want to experience what Wilco, Woodie  Guthrie, Pete Seeger and others were singing about, this book will bring it  all to life through Steinbeck's timeless words. Steinbeck makes the life of  migrant farm workers come alive for us, while revealing the prejudices they  were up against in the 30's.<br />Sadly, it is timely because it seems to be  part of human nature to separate ourselves from those who are in need.  If  we can convince ourselves that our own wants, needs, desires are different,  or that we are more deserving, we can rest assured that nothing bad will  come our way.<br />A thick juicy book, with every word necessary and  perfectly placed.

B00003OSSL|3.0|For those who thought the plot of &quot;Random Hearts&quot; was long, drawn out, and a bit dull, I agree.  For those who thought that it wasn't  the plot that is important, but rather the emotions and characterizations  created by two excellent actors, I also agree.  As I'm a little in both  camps, I guess that means I thought the movie was a little dragged out but  that the emotions on display were on the money.  Or, to put it another way,  I admired the movie more than enjoyed it.  I think that is how I feel,  but... this was a strange film.  So who knows how I will feel tomorrow?  Here is one more example of the strangeness:  did anyone else notice the  subversive little theme running under the surface, namely the idea that  affairs are okay as long they don't become serious?  Ford's character is  comforted by a former co-worker of his dead wife, who tried to make him  feel better by saying that she, too, caught her spouse in an affair when  she went home for lunch unexpectedly one day.  But she never confronted her  husband about it because she herself was having an affair at the same time.  &quot;There was nothing wrong in our relationship,&quot; she went on.  &quot;I guess we both just wanted to have a little fun and excitement in  our routine lives, and it would be a sad thing if people had to give up the  thrill of new adventures just because they're settled in a marriage.&quot;  And later, when the Congresswoman's daughter finds out about her dead  father's infidelity, she wonders aloud, &quot;Was it serious?&quot;  Which  implies that if the affair wasn't &quot;serious&quot;, then maybe it wasn't  something to cry over as much.  Interesting, interesting.  I also agree  with other reviewers that the crooked cop subplot really had nothing to do  with the rest of the story.  I think I DID see its true purpose, however.  The cop storyline, which surfaced for a minute or two once ever twenty  minutes or so, functioned as a sort of badly-needed intermission from the  grim proceedings that made up the rest of the movie.  During the cop  subplot scenes, we got to see the old Harrison Ford, the one we LIKE to  see- punching a guy, delivering a tough line or two, acting intense, and  pointing his gun- before we had to go back for another bunch of scenes  detailing the grim, serious stuff.  I'm still deciding if this film is a  refreshing change from usual Hollywood fare- namely a challenging drama- or  an interesting failure. I will say this; the movie IS worth seeing.  You  might want to rent it first, though, before hitting that &quot;buy with one  click&quot; button.n from the  grim proceedings that made up the rest of the movie.

B00000IQUT|4.0|When I looked at all the reviews, I was sure that the movie was going to be ultraviolent.  I was right, and yet it was disturbing in another way.   It was good and well crafted.  It contained violence and gore, sexuality,  and heart pounding suspense. <br />     The movie is about a woman who moves  to a house.  She sits in the sun everyday.  Little does she know that  someone is watching her, and something horrible is about to happen.  Soon,  she is raped by four men.  Left for dead, she seeks vengeance against the  perpetrators of the crime. The police can't help her, so she takes matters  into her own hands.  The four men realize that they are dropping like  flies.  They decide to fight back before they are all dead.<br />     Camille  Keaton gives a stunning performance as a vengeful woman who is a vicitm of  a rape crime.  In the uncut version, the rape scene is exteneded and more  disturbing.  The movie contains extreme gore and gratituous nudity.  I  would recommend this to anyone who would like to see Camille Keaton getting  raped and taking bloody revenge.

6305358567|5.0|Of course there are some inaccuracies--no one wants to watch 100% real history...yawn! That's why its a movie and not a documentary...geniuses!  Everyone's a critic. Or a cynic. Or an expert. (Watch out for those know it  alls...they usually don't!)<br />I have written and taught about Tudor history  for years. I am no expert, per se, but I do applaud this rendidition. First  of all, historians, without the benefit of actually travelling back in time  to witness things for themselves, have always relied on secondary sources,  documents, art work, and recorded hearsay to draw their conclusions. And  the biographers and clerks of Elizabeth's day were, human, fallible and  subject to their own prejudices and opinions. And so are modern day  biographers and historians. It is all speculation...I am in agreement with  the director's view that Elizabeth was no virgin. That she had a sexual  relationship with Dudley, etc. And that the Virgin Queen facade was just a  tool to manipulate her enemeies and pacify her allies. And a very clever  one at that! (Atta girl, Liz! Brava!)<br />She was clearly a woman ahead of  her time and knew (from the heinous death of her mother Anne Boelyn among  others) how fragile a woman's role was, how giving too much love or power  over to any man could be the end of her. So she stayed true to herself and  wed to her country and realm. There is no clear evidence she was or was not  a virgin...in the literal sense. But given her lusty nature, her closeness  with Leicester, etc. it doesn't take a genius to speculate this. But since  any difinitive evidence has long since disappeared (most likely during  Elizabeth's reign or soon after her death, destroyed by people who feared  the political havoc such evidence would cause...) no one should say who is  right or wrong in regard to this issue. <br />And this is just scratching the  surface of the 'indescrepancies' reviewers have touched upon. Get over it!  It's a movie! Enjoy it and be done with it!Lighten up people!<br />For an  interesting take on her life, read Robin Maxwell's The Secret Diary of Anne  Boelyn followed by its sequel, The Queen's Bastard (which presents the case  that Dudley and Elizabeth had a child out of wedlock...juicy stuff that  given the circumstances could have very well happened. Fiction, but it is  very believable and makes you wonder if this 'lost history' really  existed! )

And  from now on I'll only eat out on Tuesdays.
0385484518|5.0|This book was a quick read that I found to be both poignent and touching.   In essence, it is the rediscovery of what is important in life as a student  faces the death of his mentor.  Morrie is full of life till the last moment  he spends on this earth, and we as readers are the better for it.  Mitch  Albom captures Morrie's zest for life and acceptance of his fate perfectly,  and the reverence he has for his teacher is felt within each paragraph.  I  loved this book so much that I gave it to my boss, who has served as my  mentor, and she loved it as well.  Tuesdays with Morrie will move you, and  you will regret the fact that is it so short as you turn the last page.
0790742780|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movie about urban vigilatism. It rivals &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; in my opinion. Michael Douglas is Bill  Foster, an unemployed defense worker who snaps one day on a hot Los Angeles  freeway traffic jam. He goes on a quest to get to his estranged wife and  daughter. The assorted characters he meets all convey a message and show a  different aspect of Los Angeles. Together, they form a microcosm of our  society. Robert Duval is affecting as Prendergast, a retiring detctive who  follows Bill Foster's violent past of self-destruction across the city. He  realises his similarities to Foster as he does so. It's sad because you  realize that Foster's just an ordinary guy who couldn't take society's  pressure and injustice anymore. I think Michael Douglas was cheated out of  an Academy Award nomination. The explosive ending is great and makes you  think.
B000002B30|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out in 1995, now five years later this is still my favorite CD by a long shot.  Beofre I purchased the greatest hits  album i knew only a couple of Springsteens songs primarily the &quot;Born  in the USA&quot; stuff from the radio.  I was incredibly excited to get  this CD and was never disappointed.  The changes in Bruce's style from the  renegade hero of Born to Run, to the sad man who had lost all his dreams in  the River, to the hero returning from Vietnam and becoming disillusioned  with America, in Born in the USA.  THis also has some of his softer love  ballads, Brilliant Diguise, Human Touch and Secret Garden.  Everytime I  listen to this CD I find something new that I love about it.  Since buying  this CD I have gone on to buy every other album of Bruce, and while there  are some notable exceptions (I'm on Fire and Two Hearts) the album is still  the definition of Bruce Springsteen as it encompasses all that he wishes to  write about.
630529142X|4.0|I was expecting this movie to be unbelievably silly and stupid (it is Adam Sandler), but it was truly funny and I enjoyed it. He plays the water  supplier for a losing college football team. After tackling a player after  he was teased, he is wanted by the coach to play. But his mother (Kathy  Bates) has sheltered him because she doesn't want to lose him. She doesn't  want him to play. Fairuza Balk is his girlfriend and stands beside him even  though he isn't popular. Most people thought he was stupid or slow, but he  really didn't develop people skills because of his mother's sheltering. The  movie tries to show that parents need to let go of children a little to  help them to learn to survive. But the film's primary goal is to entertain  and be funny.
B00000255F|5.0|If I was on a deserted island and had to choose three CDs this one would  be number one, (Born in the USA and Mellencamp's Greatest Hits being the  other two).  Unbelievable sound as Sprinsteen really captures you in his  romantic hero.  Thunder Road and Born to Run really capturing the emotion  of this album, mix in Tenth Avenue Freeze Out and Backstreets and you have  Four of Bruce's top songs.  But this album from Thunder Road to Jungle Land  is truly spectacular.  Real good classic rock that is timeless.  If you  like Good music that tells a story and is appealing to the ear this is the  album.  Highest Possible recomendation.
B00003CX6P|5.0|This movie made me wonder if I really did want to be someone else, and how far I would go to assume an identity. Matt Damon is Tom Ripley, who is sent  to 1950s Italy to retrieve a millionaire's lazy son and his fiancee. Ripley  is enamored with the lifestyle of Dickie Greenleaf, so he decides to kill  him and assume his identity. Matt Damon took a refreshing step with this  movie, which made me see him as a real actor, rather than a  &quot;heartthrob&quot; puppet. The cinematography is excellent, and the  Italian locales are beautiful. I hear it's based on a book, so maybe I'll  read that and see how it relates to the movie. It's not a typical suspense  thriller, but it does scare you because it makes you think about identity.

The majority of people I know are Britney  fans, so I would recommend it to almost anyone. Oops and Lucky, the 1st 2  singles are great. I hope Stronger and What U See (is What U Get) are the  next two, casue those are awesome songs. The CD is totally full of great  songs, I know it won't daisappoint any pop fan!
0425152251|5.0|This book was an exciting, intreging way to learn philosophy and still  have a storyline.  The story gravitates around the philosophy or  philosopher you are looking at and includes symbols found throughout the  book.  The author made the philosophys so easy that I could understand it.   If anyone has read the Parable of the Cave, well you know how hard that  story and the idea behind it is, but the was the author describes it  actually makes sense.  I would definetly read this again.
006016848X|4.0|I can understand why so many people find this book rather annoying.  The  title is a bit cutesy, it has the same media-hyped, undeserved popularity  of teenybopper pop groups,  it has spawned a whole cottage industry, and  people usually don't levy that much trust on pop-psych books, anyway,  especially if they are in trade paperback form.  This books is just so easy  to make fun of.  But it isn't all cheese.  MAFM,WAFV will at least help you  remember that there ARE fundamental differences between most men and women  (as indeed there are between all human beings), an important thing to keep  in mind when you can't understand why your partner is being so incredibly  dense.  And it will help you understand the basic differences between men  and women, even though it oversimplifies things a bit.  Sure beats hauling  out three thousand page psychology textbooks and taking a course when all  you want to know is why your partner is being so obtuse.
B000002AVF|5.0|I got this CD for my birthday when I was about 7 and up until then I had  listened to tapes so I listened to all of the songs a million times and I  love ALL of them. This is a very good blues CD if you like slow songs then  I would reccomend this to you. It dosn't really have any fast songs,  Fantasy is the closest that she comes to having a fast song on this CD so  if you like fast music then you may get a little bored with this. Her voice  is amazing and this album proves how talented she is!
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle, in my opinion, is the 2nd best Floyd album.  Their unforceful  approach to their songs allows the listener to truly sit back and relax.   &quot;Fearless&quot;  is my personal favorite on this record--it features  simple acoustic guitar with some sweet keyboard effects and a spirit-esque  melody.  The last track, &quot;Echoes&quot;  is a Floyd classic.  Running  over 23 minutes long, this song is a trip into a Floydian wonderland.  At  seven minutes in, it gets FUNKY.  (in a good way) Classic. Classic.  5  stars all the way.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|Does this guy George Lucas know how to make his money? Yep, for  the fifth (or even more) time he releases his classic trilogy of the Star Wars saga.  The new edition contains the Special edition of all three movies. Besides  that it contains a 10 minute sneak preview of &quot;the making&quot; of the  upcoming film, Episode 2, which is the only selling argument from my point  of view. I will bet that Lucasfilm wants to earn as much money thay can on  these movies they can, before the costumors demands a version of the  movies on DVD. And I believe the DVD versions are only a few month away.   But for the die hard fan this re - re - re -re -re release is a must. The  movies comes with a totally new cover in pan scan and widescreen.   George... we want these movies on DVD, not on VHS.  I give this re-release  five stars, because VHS is what it is. If this had been the DVD release,  and the movies only contained this. I wouldt rave rated it 1 star. The  audience is listening. I hope Lucas is listening to the audience too.
B00004TWZG|5.0|I had the fortune of watching this movie when I was living abroad in its entirety and I have to say the extra 20 minutes of footage really  contributes to the intense plot.<br />Yes there were some suggestions of  pedophilia, but in reality if you look closer at the relationship, it  wasn't so much in a sexual sense as it was on an emotional level...and you  really need to watch the added scenes a few times to really understand  that.  The new scenes really add a whole new level of depth to the movie  that was sorely lacking in the US version.  In fact the added scenes almost  help you make better sense of all the characters and really understand just  the scope of their relationship with each other.  I almost felt I watched a  whole new film and I am really glad to see that it finally made it to these  shores.<br />Luc Besson has had his share of misses (see the Messenger as a  great example), but this, along with La Femme Nikita, are really excellent  films that have an enormous amount of tension and substance.  Don't miss  out on this flick!
0449227421|2.0|I have read every book by Ken Follett andd this is a great disappointment.   The characters were very wooden and shallow and the end was very  predictable and trite.  I will continue to read Follett in hopes that this  book was a bad fluke!
0345350499|5.0|I had never read any fantasy or King Arthur/Merlin novels.  Zimmer  Bradley's novel was a great introduction to a now favoured genre.  I have  only one criticism of this work and it has nothing to do with the writer  (who is a literary genius, in my humble opinion) or with the story (which  was enthralling, rivetting, entertaining and all adjectives of a similiar  meaning.)  My criticism of this book stems purely from my own personal  annoyance at the self-righteous, hypocritical and ultimately destructive,  behaviour of Guinevere.  My cries of anger, dismay and frustration at the  behaviour of this annoying woman had my father rushing into my room at 3am  thinking something terrible was happening.  (He wasn't too happy to know  he'd been woken because of my reactions to a book.)  But this is no reason  to not read this fabulous book.  It will give you great pleasure to know  that all her self-righteousness and hypocrisy lead to her own eternal  misery.  A great consolation for an adamant anti-Guineverian!
6305858764|2.0|This movie was such a poor adaption of Patricia Highsmith's fine and chilling novel, that it's laughable!  The characters in the screenplay have  none of the complexities in the novel; rather, they are all two  dimensional, shallow and boring.  I found that I did not care what happened  to these characters, where I couldn't put the book down.  The reason I gave  it two stars, rather than one was because the filming was beautiful.  Take  my advice, spend the money on the novel, don't waste it on this film!
0380788624|3.0|Bummer. The first two-thirds of this book is big and funny and gutsy. The  four major characters (three of whom fight WWII in various ways while the  fourth helps launch a present-day startup) glance off each other just  frequently enough so that you can't wait until Stephenson pulls the whole  schmeer together.<br />Then along comes page 600 and you get that crummy  feeling that maybe he never WILL pull the whole schmeer together. But hope  springs eternal.<br />Page 700 ... Stephenson is still introducing new  characters and ideas. Your hopes fade. Might this be another potentially  excellent novel that sinks because editors lacked the guts to tell the  writer to quit jacking around and write a great finish?<br />Page 800 ... the  protagonist is stuck with a Yoda character, having some sort of  impenetrable Platonic dialogue about Greek gods. This scene would be rotten  in the first 100 pages. Falling this close to the end of a book that could  have been great, it's an utter disaster. And you realize that yeah, this is  just another book by a scifi guy with a great imagination  who wouldn't  know pacing if he tripped over it. Too bad.
B000009DUY|4.0|Although the soundtrack by itself may be a little quiet, i liked it. Im  glad that John Williams decided not to put in too much, otherwise it would  have detracted from the movies raw power. I recommend this to anyone who  enjoys good patriotic music. And pick up the medal of honor soundtrack as  well!
0679759328|1.0|Had just read Altered States, which I loved. Thought, if Hotel du Lac won  the Booker Prize, it must be great, right? Wrong. As interesting and  entertaining as Altered States was, this book was not--dull people, dull  story, all in all, a waste of an afternoon. Luckily, it was a Library book  and not a wasted purchase.

B00001NFCY|1.0|of all the post-grunge bands, i nominate this band as the band that does  the most talking without saying anything at all. this music is some of the  most generic and uninspired i have heard in the last few years. stealing  riffs from soundgarden, led zeppelin, pearl jam, and even (choke)  cinderella! the lyrics, however inspired by this guys aspirations for  martyrdom, are blase and boring! if you wanna hear christian rock go listen  to stryper! this album just plain stinks - like the band!
B00000JMQC|5.0|I was 1 when it came out but I must have seen it when I was at least 5. I remember I loved it so much and I really was never frightened of it as a  child. I just thought ti was the coolest thing and Ozma became my  'invisible friend' (i know, i know im wierd) anyway my parents thought i  was becoming too obsessive about it. Even at that young age! And I remember  it being on tv and i was not allowed to watch it!  I was grounded from it.  impossible to imagine but sadly yes. I havent seen it in since and it  remains one of those childhood things thta just gives you that memory of  childhood. If you know what I mean.
B00004SCX6|2.0|This album was satisfactory and pretty good since it came from over produced wanna be singer Britney Spears. Some of the songs were catchy like  &quot;Stronger&quot; and &quot;What U See (Is What U Get)&quot;, but get  tiring and loud toward the end of the song. All of the songs were just Ms.  Spears singing with a lot of electronic help and too much electronic noise  to be called the instrumental. Her voice creaks through every song even  with all the overproduction put into each song. <br />She does try and you  could listen to almost every song without cringing too much. Her effort in  &quot;Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know&quot; just makes you want to run and  hide because of her screeching and cracking. Most of the ballads  (&quot;Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know&quot;, &quot;Dear Diary&quot;) are  just too monotonous to stand without skipping through.   Her songwriting  efforts are a nice try in &quot;Dear Diary.&quot; The song has no structure  which is a chorus, some verses, and a bridge like her other songs. <br />So  basically, I would not buy this album because it's just overproduced pop  with a teenager who cannot sing even with loads of electronic help.
B00004RF83|5.0|I do not know what happened to John Frankenheimer.  He recently directed the less than stellar Reindeer Games and Island of Dr. Moreau.  But once  upon a time Frankenheimer was a top notch director putting out classics  such as The Train, Manchurian Candidate, and Seven Days in May.<br />Seven  Days in May is as topical now as it was years ago when it was made.  Burt  Lancaster is awesome as a popular MacArthur type General prepared to launch  a military coup against an unpopular elected President.  Kirk Douglas plays  his adjunct who works to stop the plot and protect the President.<br />As good  as the story is and as good as the other actors in the film are you must  check out how good Douglas and Lancaster are in their scenes together.  IT  is the equivalent of Pacino and Deniro in the coffee shop during Heat.   These two tear up the scenery.<br />Anyone interested in watching on of the  best political thrillers ever made needs to see this film.  It is an  awesome film.<br />This is a great DVD to own.
B00004WIBW|5.0|This film not only has good effects, but also captivates the viewers with complicated plots, and the humour is used frequently and cleverly used.
B00000478B|5.0|At the time this 10-CD set was issued, it may very well have been the best box set produced.  And even considering the fancier packages and more complex concepts that have founded newer sets,  the actual content of this  release still holds  up to the very best. Everything, from the quality of  the players, song selection, performances, remastering, liner notes,  discographical information, session notes and photographs is absolute  five-star material.<br /><br />This set replays all the previously issued Verve  material, plus over two hours of previously unissued tracks.  The set  includes a number of studio sessions, both with Parker's own combos, as  well as guest appearances with other's orchestras and bands.  Additionally,  the discs are filled with historic live performances, beginning with the  legendary &#34;Jazz at the Philharmonic&#34; shows of the mid-40's, and  progressing through a 1950 show at Carnegie Hall.  The new material  includes alternate takes, partial takes and false starts, and complete,  previously unreleased tracks.  Over two hours of previously unissued  material.<br /><br />The programming is mostly excellent, though the fragmentary  pieces are better for study than for tracking through; The false starts and  partial takes are fascinating from a musicological point of view, but less  so if you just want to hear some great jazz.  The bulk of this compilation  is complete tracks, whether master takes or alternates, so the additional  material is not much of a hinderence. ...The label was careful to preserve entire sessions/live  performances on single discs, hence the varying lengths.<br /><br />Parker's  development and excursions (e.g., into Cuban bop with Machito, playing with  strings arranged by the likes of Jimmy Carroll) are well represented and  displayed on this set.  The opportunity to hear Parker's saxophone up  against a variety of players and settings brings out more than one could  get from any single session or live performance.<br /><br />The engineers have done  an impressive job of handling material of this vintage.  While most of the  tracks don't necessarily have the depth of the 1950's Bluenote recordings,  they are certainly not lacking in depth and clarity.  Some of the high-end  trumpet work is a bit shrill, but then again, a trumpet pushing it's upper  reaches is a pretty shrill sound to begin with.  A few of the tracks have a  small amount of surface noise (assumedly these were transferred from discs  where original master tapes could not be found), but nothing that gets in  the way of the music.<br /><br />The session notes, intertwined with session  commentary are invaluable.  The personnel listings, as well as the  solo-order listings help both expert and neophyte figure out who's playing.  The anecdotes that are interspersed really help bring these sessions and  performances to life.  The photos are also well-picked and well printed.  From solo shots of Parker with his sax to group shots including Dizzy  Gillespie, a very young Buddy Rich (with Mitch Miller visible in the  background), Ray Brown, Tommy Potter, Max Roach, a young, slightly nervous  looking John Coltrane, a young Miles Davis, Red Rodney (lookin' like a mug  out of a Warner Brothers movie), Barney Kessel, Ben Webster, Johnny Hodges  and many others.<br /><br />In addition to the detailed picture of Charlie Parker,  this box provides a welcome introduction to Buddy Rich, drummer (as opposed  to Buddy Rich, anachronicstic gold-chain wearing swing-band leader). His  drumming on this set shows the same sort of power that later became his  trademark, but it also shows him as a drummer rather than a band leader,  backing a combo of players that were his equals, rather than his band.<br /><br />One of the other great moments in this set is hearing the crowd going  completely out of their heads during the closing solo of the 1949 JATP  version of &#34;Perdido.&#34;  Whether it's Flip Phillips (as it's  thought to be) or Coleman Hawkins (as it's rumored to be--the crowd seems  to be yelling for Hawkins to play, and the solo apparently quotes some  familiar Hawkins lines, but none of the players remember Hawkins actually  being onstage during this performance), the screaming and yelling of the  audience is the sort of passion I've never witnessed at a jazz performance.  You can feel the entire crowd just carried completely away. Amazing...  especially the guy who yells &#34;Go! Go! Go!&#34; just like in the  movies.<br /><br />Also surprising are the Charlie Parker with Strings tracks. For  the most part the strings stay out of the way and let Parker play, though  some of these tracks do sound a little bit like &#34;dinner  jazz.&#34; An expensive box set, but well worth the investment for  anyone who really wants to get a deep understanding of Parker's work during  this period.lling for Hawkins to play, and the solo apparently quotes some  familiar Hawkins lines, but none of the players remember Hawkins actually  being onstage during this performance), the screaming and yelling of the  audience is the sort of passion I've never witnessed at a jazz performance.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok Computer is truly the best album I ever heard. Simply because I never  heard an album on wich every track is sung in such a beautiful atmosphere  that it really moves me. Every song on OKC is breathtaking with 'Paranoid  Android'probably as one of the best songs of the record. When I finished  listening the entire album I was totally overwhelmed. It is from the first  track till the last one a piece of pure melancolic emotions that grabs you  and forces you to listen to it(no background music).<br />OKC maybe needs a  few listenings for some people. It has a lot of (brilliant) background  noises but it can't stop you from listening cause of Thom's incredible  singing and unbelievable beautiful, serious lyrics. All the songs together  is on whole story of the world we live in nowadays. A world of with anxious  isolated people in the consuming information age on wich they have no  control of. It couldn't be better translated into music as Radiohead has  achieved with Ok Computer. An album that must be in your record collection
6305537798|5.0|I enjoyed this film for its fresh, new stars and clever wit, but most of all for the fact that a majority of it was filmed in my home town, Tacoma,  Washington. Tacoma is about 40 miles south of Seattle. Stadium High School  is the beautiful, towering school (once a hotel) that the main characters  attend. Kat backs into her nemisis' car in front of Ted Brown Music in  downtown Tacoma. Kat and Bianca live in a beautiful, yellow Queen Anne  style home in one of Tacoma's beautiful neighborhoods that overlooks Puget  Sound. I thought the movie portrayed our city in a very positive light that  is appropriate for the Shakespeare theme (even though they say it's in  Seattle). It was very exciting having Hollywood come to us; I live less  than a mile from that neighborhood and know people who lived kitty-corner  from the &quot;movie house&quot;. Many of my friends' older siblings from  Stadium were extras in the film. I enjoy the plot - the character's  personality's don't fluctuate or surprise you that much, but they are  played by a talented young cast. I recommend this movie and am out to say,  &quot;Tacoma is NOT Seattle!&quot; <br />      Enjoy!

0613028155|5.0|Through many years of exciting adventures, i must say that The Never  Ending Story was the very first book that related with me, because of my  hunger for adventure and fantasy.  I found myself reading each chapter  intently and wanting more of the book, every time I finished a page.   Bastian, being a small fat kid whose life was just another joke, came  across an old book in which captivated him when he read the title.   Continuing through the book, in the attic of his school, he found out that  he was not just reading an ordinary book; he was apart of a Never Ending  Story.  In breath taking adventures he had traveled with a warrior named  Atreyu, as he read, Searching a cure for the Child-like-Empress' illness.   As creatures, storms and a &quot;Nothing&quot; attacked Atreyu, and his  reader (Bastian), they embarked upon wild excitement that could never be  forgotten... accept when Bastian is pulled into the Story and gradually  losing his memory.  With a twist to the Plot you will be amazed of what  will happen before Bastian barely slips back on earth.  It is one of the  most intriguing books that i have ever read.  Who ever is considering the  book... Please GET IT!!!   A Picky Reader! jg

B000002V1D|5.0|If I was stuck on an island with only one album this would be my choice.  I've listened to and studied this album more than any other album before or  since. The tracks on this album have inspired my music more than all the  others. It is amazing to think this was recorded in Warren's living room. I  know that jamie smith band wouldn't be the same without it!
B00004U30D|1.0|Though the acting &amp; directing were suberb the plot was crude, disgusting, &amp; not a movie to spend one cent on. My brother, friends,  &amp; cousin went to see this movie as a group because of the great  ratings. By the middle of the movie we had lost three members of our group  who had bought tickets to another film. The film which was originally a  teen flick turned out to be a 5 time Academy Award winner &amp; went to  become one of the most hated movies of 99. If I had a choice to watch water  trickle down a porch or this movie I choose the water.

My favorite Disney film until The  Rescuers was released is still a favorite of mine. The animation is  spectacular &amp; the villin Malificent is the most evil and terrifing  Disney villin ever. The story takes place in a magical medievil kingdom  where King Stephan &amp; his Queen have just been given the gift of a baby  which they named Aurora. During the celbration of her birth the three good  faries Flora, Fauna, &amp; Merryweather bestow gifts upon the tiny  princess.

158234082X|4.0|I'm one of those people who loves to cook and has occasionally been told  &quot;You should open a restaurant!&quot;, so I read this book with great  interest -- also in part because one of my sisters is a professional cook.  I read the book in one sitting and found it enormously entertaining.  In no  real sense does &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; meet its advertising  claims -- that it's going to be shocking and dismaying to professionals in  the industry who are going to see their secrets revealed.  I don't think  so.  I'm not sure I really wanted to know that this particular chef used to  engage in blood-squirting contests with his fellow cooks, true, but I  didn't see anything in the book, including information about older  foodstuffs in the freezer, that I hadn't suspected as a frequent diner or,  for that matter, seen while I was a waiter during college.  Rather, I found  this book entertaining as the autobiography of a scoundrel who clawed his  way back up to the top, and -- what was particularly interesting and  touching -- demonstrating great loyalty to his friends and supporters all  along the way.  The look which Bourdain gives into restaurant kitchens was  intriguing but secondary to me.  I can agree with other reviewers that the  book could have used considerably tighter editing in some places, and the  most screaming shortcoming as far as I'm concerned is the lack of  photographs. I'm sure I was not the only one who REALLY wanted to see what  the crazed guy who is the world's best bread baker looks like.  Be that as  it may, I was hooked on this character when he swallowed his first raw  oyster at the age of nine, and I stayed hooked all the way through the  book.  It's great!
B00004TDRD|5.0|I cannot begin to tell you what experience this movie gave me.  At the age of 7 I first saw this movie and I have loved it ever since.  It was really  well done and I was totally astounded by it.  It truly deserved its huge  audiences worlwide in 1975.  This new edition on video is truly a work of  art.  The second tape including the making of the movie and the outtakes  and theatrical trailers was just perfect.  The picture and sound were very  well redone.  This movie is now part of my collection and I hope that the  many people who read this review buy it.  Take my word for it.  You are not  wasting your money.  This VHS collector's edition is a must!
B00004XPP0|5.0|I must say that the final vision of George Lucas' Star Wars Trilogy is unbelievable.  I think that anyone who doesn't like the new and updated  versions are depriving themselves of having an open mind.  I've seen many  kids eyes light up like mine did the first time that I saw the movies.  I  think that we all need to realize that most of us are not movie directors  and most specifically not George Lucas.  And yes we may be able to have our  own opinions but until you can make a movie that can stand the test of time  like the Star Wars Trilogy I don't think that any of us can say that George  Lucas' visions are not keeping with what we all remember as being those of  our childhood.

B000021XR5|5.0|STP's No 4 provides a good mix of diffrent music. There are songs like &quot;Sour Girl&quot; and &quot;I got You&quot; that have almost a beatles  sound to is. But there are also other good hard rock songs Like  &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;Sex and Violence.&quot; &quot;Atlanta&quot; is a  great ballad. In fact all the songs on this CD are great! I still have this  thing in my Portable CD player even though I bought it a couple of months  ago! It's hard to get tired of them. Though I'm a new fan to the band I  think that it's a great CD. I think I might go buy some of there old ones  now. It's a excelent CD for Rock fans.
B0000027I6|5.0|In Roger's most recent solo effort he again takes a jab at modern society as he displays a pessimistic view of our demise. In this album he attacks  television, war as entertainment(following the Persian Gulf War), and  organized religion. In &quot;What God Wants&quot; Roger details how world  religions have used god's name to justify their actions. He attacks  television and war in songs like &quot;Too Much Rope&quot;, &quot;Watching  TV&quot; and &quot;Perfect Sense&quot;. The album ends on a sour note with  the human race &quot;amusng itself to death&quot;. The poor points of this  album are the places where Roger takes s personal shots at certain people,  including Nick Mason, Bob Ezrin, Stanley Kubrick, and Andrew Lloyd Weber.  Despite this it is a truly great work.
0783225881|4.0|Most of the time we're told that God moves in mysterious ways. There is a grand plan but it is too complex for any one person to understand. Well,  that has never sat comfortably with me and it is this feeling that  &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; addresses. We watch spellbound as one act on  the part of an Iowa Farmer, brings about positive changes in a great many  lives. What at first seems a crazy act, blossoms into a miracle, as the  full scope of the plan becomes apparent.<br /><br />This movie speaks to many  parts of the human heart but the common theme is redemption. Most of us  have regrets, some big, some small. But all we can  usually do is dream  about the world of &quot;what if&quot;. When Ray Kinsella, (Costner),  starts to hear voices, &quot;what if&quot; starts to become very real  indeed. Psychiatrists would not hesitate to diagnose a farmer, who hears  voices and then plows his corn crop under to build a baseball diamond, as  schizoid. But Ray has more faith than most doctors, and his wife, Anni,  supports him all the way.<br /><br />Despite the financial problems of the  farm, Ray listens to the voice and takes off on a road trip. He aims to  find Terrence Mann, (James Earl Jones), a famous writer from the 60's who  has dropped out of the public eye. Interestingly, the voice never told him  to do this. It tends to be very general about things, saying &quot;If you  build it, he will come&quot; or &quot;Go the distance&quot;. But Ray  becomes adept at reading the signs and interpreting the  specifics.<br /><br />As he travels across the country, Ray picks up  partners. And in the end he manages to participate in several  transformation which are much more remarkable than a cornfield turning into  a ballpark. A burned-out writer gets  an injection of passion. A small town  doctor gets to play out a lost opportunity. A disgraced ball player is able  to pick up the bat one more time. Ray is finally able to forgive and  apologize to his father, and his family farm gets a new lease on life.<br /><br />It's true that &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is a feel good film with a  happy ending but it's more than the standard Hollywood treacle. Powerful  themes are woven amongst some very real characters. Themes like faith,  trust, perseverance, selflessness and hope. Of course it also says a lot  about baseball, which is not surprising given that Kevin Costner is the  star. You walk away from this movie believing in miracles and suspecting  that God may know what he's doing after all, at least when he's not busy  playing ball down in Iowa.arm gets a new lease on life.<BR>  <BR>It's true that &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; is a feel good film with a  happy ending but it's more than the standard Hollywood treacle.

158234082X|2.0|First let me say that there was a chapter toward the end of the book that was an interesting description of an average day for a chef.  The question  is, after that nightmare description, why would anyone want to become a  chef or work anywhere near a resturant kitchen?   This book was advertised  as a &quot;tell-all&quot; story about resturants.  Instead of giving us a  luscious scoop of resturant deJour, what the reader receives is more than  you ever wanted to know about the suthor's drug habit.  The story is  shallow, uneven, and disjointed.  If you want a good story to sink your  teeth into then I suggest you look elsewhere.

As an historical  document it is priceless and that alone is reason enough to re-release it  as a video or dvd.<br />We owe it to the younger generations of musicians and  music lovers to have this concert available to study and emulate.<br />Bring  back the Concert for Bangladesh video !

What happens when a  jelous butler tries to get rid of the four cats in order to get the money?  And what happend when an alley cat is there only hope to get home. Well you  got this video. Being a cat lover myself I jumped to rent it when it was  re-released a couple of years ago and I thought it was a great movie. Being  a Disney movie you can expect laughs, a little bit of action, and puppy  opps kitty love. Though not my favriote animated movie it sure is a good  one.
B00004U5SC|5.0|Sam Peckinpaugh, who directed &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; and &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; among several other westerns, credited &quot;Shane&quot; as an influence on his career. Director George Stevens originally envisioned Montgomery Clift in the title role, William Holden as Joe Starrett, and Katherine Hepburn as Starrett's wife. Those are among the stories told by the director's son, George Stevens Jr., during an interesting commentary track (also featuring associate producer Ivan Moffat) on this long-awaited DVD version of this film classic. &quot;Shane&quot; is on most people's short lists of the best westerns ever filmed. This DVD transfer will not disappoint, although I believe the movie was originally released in a wide screen format and here it is standard frame. It is not made clear if the theater release was a matted version of this full frame, or if we are losing some of the picture here. Still, the vistas of the Grand Teton mountain range are beautiful and there is more sharpness in the picture than in the VHS version. The sound, mostly confined to the front center channel, is adequate considering this is a 1953 film. This story of the aging gunfighter, Shane, who takes part in the struggle of the homesteaders' fight with a headstrong cattleman can be enjoyed on many levels. Beautifully filmed, beautifully written, beautifully acted, this film deserves the praised heaped upon it for years. And Paramount, at the time, didn't have any idea the quality of film it had. That, too, is mentioned in the commentary, which isn't overwhelming when compared to talk on other DVDs, but it is quite entertaining. &quot;Shane&quot; on DVD is worth the price.

I guess you either get it or you don't.  We  didn't.
B000005HFH|5.0|mr. baker produced some of his best music when working for pacific jazz in  the '50s, as this album well documents. he was a master of the west coast  (cool) jazz sound (taking bebop's chordal revolution, slowing it down, and  staying in the middle register). he had a tenor voice that could melt  butter, making ballads and love songs burn with romantic fire that never  scorched. he created a mood: dark, candle-lit room, flames glowing in the  fire place, wine chilled, blankets spread, but with just a hint of the blue  note-- bittersweet perfection. highlights are: &quot;but not for me,&quot;  &quot;my funny valentine,&quot; &quot;time after time,&quot; and &quot;my  ideal.&quot; he also played an intensely quiet trumpet, sort of like miles,  the founder of cool, but mellower (the best instrumental baker is his  best-of album with gerry mulligan on pacific jazz). put this one on, dim  the lights, and let the evening unfold...

B000002SE0|5.0|Nilsson and Corelli are of course great in the dramatic singing level. But  in the beautiful tessitura level, Joan Sutherland is much more convincing  in the sheer perfection of voice department, and a much warmer voice in my  opinion. La Stupenda had it all. But I have to admit, I need this recording  as well as the Sutherland/Pavorotti version because of the spine tinkling  singing but Franco Corelli. Scotto is also very good.

The two  are launched into an amazing adventure that puts them to the test. Can they  tolerate eachother enough to get back home to Andy? Rent this movie and  see. If you like computer animation you'll love this one.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies that I have seen in years!  It is relentless in the way that it bombards the viewer with surprises and  nonsequiters.<br />I have heard some reviews by mainstream critics that have  accused this film of being low-brow and misogynistic.  I believe they have  missed the point.  This is actually a character study of some very  interesting people.<br />I am not going to give much away because, if you have  already seen the movie, you know.  If you haven't, I would hate to spoil  the fun of the first viewing for you.  But look for Bob.  The way that he  is introduced near the beginning of the film kills me every time.  And  you'll never look at a bar of soap quite the same again.<br />I am Jack's  unfulfilled need for the instant gratification of saying more about  &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  But this is one that you have to see for yourself.

B0000028RR|5.0|being a strong conservatist, i'm not too much of a fan of the lyrical  messages that are so prevalent in La Roch's singing.   however, i still  love this cd simply because i admire the music itself.  <br />the hip-hop rock  is an element shown perfectly throughout this cd. while zack de la roche is  rapping, the soon to be guitar god tom morello (who i do believe to be a  genius) battles with his metal/rock rifs, both opposites but still blending  together perfectly. having listened to all of RATM's cds, i do believe that  only they could conquer this feat of synthesis. <br />if you haven't listened  to RATM before, go out and listen to them.  though they're truly a  different experience, they're nonetheless amazing

B00003CXFG|5.0|I went to the movie EXPECTING a silly, bloody, jump-out-and-scare-you movie, with a plot full of holes, and one-dimensional characters.<br />I was  pleasantly suprised. The story itself makes sense, the characters have some  sense of depth, the cinematography is wonderful, and the special effects  are great. It's a lot more than the previews made it look like.<br />I would  definitely recommend this to anybody who liked the Alien movies, or  Starship Troopers. A must-see science-fiction.
B00004WG28|4.0|My wife and I thought the film was very well done. The scenery transports the viewer into an exotic time and place. Details left out of the musical  are filled in. Ms. Foster does an admirable job, and seems to enjoy her  part. It made me curious about Siam and the circumstances that caused Anna  to want to come there.

B000009HF2|4.0|Frampton Comes Alive came out of nowhere to become one of the biggest albums of all time.  Peter Frampton released several albums in the early to  mid 70's, a couple of which sold respectively.  When this album was  released in early '76, it exploded and stayed in the top ten for over a  year.  The album offers something for everybody from straight forward  rockers like &quot;It's A Plain Shame&quot;, &quot;Something's  Happening&quot; &amp; &quot;Doobie Wah&quot; to ballads like &quot;Baby, I  Love Your Way&quot; &amp; &quot;Show Me The Way&quot; to extended jams like  &quot;I Wanna Go To The Sun&quot;, &quot;Lines On My Face&quot; &amp;  &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do?&quot;.  It also has that voice-box. Frampton  is a great guitar player and an energetic performer and those traits didn't  always come across on his studio albums.  They were front &amp; center on  the live album and people tapped into that.  Frampton never again reached  the heights he reached with this album, but it stands today as a touchstone  of 70's rock music.
B000001XN2|4.0|This is excellent, Leontyne Price is flawless, but I'm disappointed at  Corelli lowering his big aria a half tone, he is capable of much better. He  is the premiere tenor of his time, of course. If you think this is  great...you buy the Meyerbeer's La Hugenotts with Corelli and the young  Joan Sutherland as the Queen. Corelli ventures into the above high C area  and he holds the notes for a long time. In the grand duet, in my opinion  the most stupendous singing of spinto singing on record, promise, grand  duet has Simionato and Corelli, not Sutheraland...but in her great scenes,  Sutherland attacks notes in the high E area and she matches even Corelli in  the tone area. La Stupenda's coloratura will make you shake your head in  disbelief. Simionato is almost as great. This was a live recording, La  Hugenotts, 1962, La Scala, Milan. In my opinion, Corelli's most  unforgettable performance, bar none!

6305718954|2.0|&quot;Stigmata&quot; is the story of an athiest woman, Frankie (Patricia Arquette), who recieves the mystical stigmata while possessed by a spirit  that bears truth of a new and possibly world-changing scripture.  As she  experiences the pains and agonies of Christ's wounds and sorrows, she is  investigated by a scientist/detective/priest (Gabriel Byrne) on behalf of  Rome.  In an effort to prove the authenticity of Frankie's miracle, the  source and truth of its messenger is realized, and that's when all hell  breaks loose.  Amidst scenes of fire and fury, The Vatican, represented by  a powerful and unsavory cardinal (Rupert Wainwright), attempts to burn the  truth by sending both Frankie and her priest to early graves.<br />Though the  film is for the most part entertaining and even somewhat informative, it is  nothing new, nor original.  The overall message of the film, that the  Vatican is willing to do anything to hide the &quot;truth&quot; and protect  it own position of power, is one of the most overdone and, frankly,  uninspired themes in American Cinema.  As with most such films, the  uninformed viewer will be appalled at the gall of the Church's hierarchy,  and will direct hate and disgust towards the dealings of Catholicism.  To  the informed and unbiased viewer, however, the film will stand as simply  another statement against organized religion.  Either way, the film  promotes individual discretion over spiritual communion, which is  liberating to some, but misguided and lonely for many many others.<br />The  movie is worth seeing if one is hoping to spark a religious debate . . . it  could be be good for a class of some sort.  If not, then the movie is  nothing more than an uninformed, terribly unfair portrayal of Catholicism  and the Vatican, as has been done numerous times before.  Relationships in  the movie are often unrealistic, and actions are portrayed in very  incriminating ways.  <br />Comparing &quot;Stigmata&quot; to &quot;The  Exorcist&quot; is ludicrous, because the former is so negative and the  latter so positive.  &quot;Stigmata&quot; does copy some scenes of  possession, but its message is one of distrust.  &quot;The Exorcist&quot;  is the opposite, in which spirituality and the Church wins over evil.  If  one wishes to see the good in Catholicism, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; is the  ultimate.  Instead of opinion, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; is driven by fact,  and therefore a more reliable source for religious convicition.   &quot;Stigmata&quot; is entertaining, but far far insuperior to its more  realistic and accurate predecessor.
0671578855|3.0|The title should give you pause, dear reader.  It didn't give it to me, but I want you to be more prepared.<br />What does Bujold do best?  What are  her characters famous for?  Why do we love to read about Miles, Miles  Mother, his Clone, his girlfriends!  Yes, Action!  Adventure! Heroics!   (and yes, some humor thrown in).  The scene in which Miles Mother presents  the head of Aral's political enemy in SOH (or Barrayar) is VERY VERY Funny.   But  the book works because it is an adventure.  A high stakes roller  coaster with characters that we like on a death defying mission.<br />All of  the books involving Miles (before he got hurt) have.  All the great short  stories have (o.k., I didn't really love MOM as much as everybody else  seems to).<br />This one doesn't.  Just like all the books since Miles got  hurt.<br />Mile's girlfriends use to be death-defying strong woman who are  beatitful and terrifying.  His new girlfriend is a gardener.  A shy  gardener.  I doubt she known how to use a weapon.  <br />Miles use to throw  all his weight (well, Admiral Naismith did) into a project, grab it by the  neck and make it work.  In this book, he campaigns for the losing side, and  knows he's beat at the end and doesn't do anything about it.  It's up to  other people to save the day. <br />In the previous books, the characters that  did the most brave/smart/heroic things were well known main characters to  us.  In this one, we have a koudlek (spelling) sister we've never met  before and Ivan.<br />Miles does nothing except woo (badly), campaign  (losingly), talk about the past, and fall in love.  Doesn't sound like the  Miles you know and love, does it?<br />Oh well.  I sincerely hope (and  believe) that this is a transition book.  Unfortunatley, it seems to be a  transition of Miles into a life of politics and family living.  Good for  him.  Not so good for us.  <br />Perhaps his children will continue the brave  heroics that I liked reading about.  But of course, they won't be Miles.   They won't have his background, or his physical handicaps.  It won't ever  be the same.<br />I think the best we can hope is that Bujold decides to right  more about the past.  More about Miles when he was whole (such as it  was).<br />But I don't want to stop you from reading this book.  It does have  a lot of humour in it.  And it does have some small flash of action.  It  was fun to read.<br />It just wasn't the Miles that we've known.  I din't  think it will ever be back again.  I miss him.
020530902X|5.0|Twenty-one years ago, a professor in one of my English Lit. classes brought out a book that was NOT one of those texts that you thought you were going to have to take along into the next life in order to finish it. The book was quite the opposite. It was a small 78 page publication that was no more intimidating than a comic book. <br />I was a student that needed help in my punctuation, word usage, and style. I hoped, as did all the students, that the day would come when we would be published. The professor said, &quot;If you're ever going to make it in the writing field, this book will be your best guide. Stick to the principles mentioned in its pages and you will achieve your goals. That is, assuming you have any writing ability in you at all.&quot; <br />Currently, I am taking a refresher course through a correspondence school back East. Guess what book is part of their curriculum? You're right, it's The Elements of Style. This time I have given the book a strict credence, and in the next few months I will have my first publishing credit.<br />I believe, The Elements of Style, is still the best book on correct writing techniques there is on the market. It was so tweny-one years ago and it will be so twenty-one years from now.<br />M.D. Cummings
0140177396|4.0|I read this book some weeks ago and I cannot stop thinkig about the life this people had to live. George and Lennie are two &quot;itinerant  workers&quot;, but not as the rest, they have one to look after the other.   A very important fact of the book is that Lennie is mentaly retarded and  George looks after him. He changes to a parental-figure when he calls  Lennie's atention &quot;Give it here&quot;. They arrive to a  &quot;ranch&quot; where they start meeting people, such as Curly, he is the  son of the boss and is really angry with Lennie, maybe because he is larger  and stronger.  Lennie could't measure his strength and because of this he  kills inocent animals such as the little pub. He shared a dream with  George, this one was: having a little ranch and rabbits Lennie was going  &quot;to pet them&quot;. But they couldn't make this dream come true  because a horrible thing happend, Lennie killed Curly's wife. She wanted to  show him that her hair was fine so she &quot;took Lennie's hand and put it  on her head&quot;. As he couldn't control himself he stroked it to hard.  The ending is really impresing and in some way sad. But why did George do  that? Please read this book, if not you will be sorry about it.
0060930349|1.0|I found this book to be informative but extremley boring. It's not very  well written, and the theme shifts very rapidly and quite often. While the  book does go in chronological order, the sub-topics jump around a lot and  it makes the whole book rather confusing. For example, on one page he'll be  talking about Benjamin Franklin's relations to the west, and on the next  page he'll be discussing the Indians and what crops they grew. There's no  real order to it all....the information is there, it just isn't well  written. This book was VERY VERY hard to read. While I did learn a lot from  it, it was an unpleasurable experience and I would not reccomend this book  to anyone.
630575067X|1.0|I am only 19 years old, having been only 2 when ROJ came out. I never knew the wonder many people felt when they first saw star wars on the big screen back in 1977. Ever since heir to the empire came out, which was the first  authorized star wars novel, back in the early '90's, I became fascinated  with the star wars galaxy. I liked the books because they usually have the  same mix of action/adventure you find in the original trilogy. But  obviously, as with all novels, there is plenty of dialog between the  characters in between space chases and the such. it fits well in a star  wars book, but not in a star wars motion picture. my first complaint is  that there is too much talking going on. it's all about galactic politics,  etc. Granted, there were slow spots in the original movies, but the dialog  usually was han solo making a smart remark at threepio, or leia, or luke.  or darth vader(at least this villian actually spoke) getting annoyed at his  subordinates. some of it was in serious tones, but it always had that air  to it that seemed almost campy, but not quite.  in the phantom mencace, you  have two-dimensinal characters speaking about things that dont really  matter in a star wars movie. for example, Queen Amidala speaks in a inhuman  voice saying &quot; i will not condone and action that will lead us to  war&quot;, or something like that. many lines are like that in this movie.  you would have never imagined such a line like that that seems to to fit in  an ultra-serious political thriller than a star wars movie. this latest  chapter just seems to have dialog that is completly un-acceptable in a star  wars film. we remember that the in the first two films made, that the  characters biggest problems were getting out of an Imp attack before they  were blown to bits. It was about space chases, light humor, and a touch of  romance. When you heard the characters talk about the plight of the  rebellion and the suffering of the peoples of the galaxy, it was spoken in  emotion, but never to be the focus of the movie. I understand lucas can't  make the same movie over and over again, but the dialog is more suitable  for one of the crappy star trek shows of the past 5 years. And everyone has  their opinion of jar jar, so i will speak briefly about him. he is a great  character, well spoken, and brings humor and lights up the screen. if he  was in a disney movie. lucas, you have proven that you can create a  character worse than willow. one other thing or two: the special effects  and computer consoles and space ships seem 50 years in the future, not the  past. The atmosphere was not there at all. the first 3 films, all had  bright color schemes in spots, but were mostly darker than ep. 1. The  Gungan race seemed liked another excuse for the ILM wizkids to show their  stuff. The special effects were the most oustanding in any movie ever made.  but i think the matrix won in all the effect catagoties at the oscars was  because the computer effects fit in the movie. it's hard to explain, but  think of it this way: the effects fit in with the real world better than  the ones in the phantom menace. they are both out of this world effects,  but the designers of the matrix tried to make the effects fit in with what  bullet time would really look like. they blend in with the atmosphere,  story, and script perfectly, without going overboard. i compare the  matrix's effects to titanic, where the effects blended into the movie  seamlessly. you know most of the shots of the boat arent real, and  sometimes they look like they are CGI.(i think it was ILM who worked on  titanic). the phantom menace tries to accomplish that, what a far away  galaxy would like, and it's respective residents. but it seemed more like a  high-tech cartoon, not a movie. the argument against this statement is that  all of the star wars films are based around state-of-the-art effects. but  can anyone really say that the new movie's effects are realistic? c'mon,  thetie fighters and spaceships in the original trilogy look nothing like a  saturday morning cartoon. in fact, the effects back then did more with  less. in the special edition movies, you can still see blocks around the  spaceships, and the effects in the original trilogy are badly outdated, but  i still find when i immerse myself in watching &quot;a new hope&quot;, i  find myself in more beliveable world than if i sit down and watch ep. 1.  the best part of the movie is the soundtrack.(most of it, anyway.)
B000002L9B|5.0|This is definitely one of the most overlooked albums of recent memory. The  music is strange and very compelling. Rhythmically and melodically complex,  most of this album works very well and stretches pop to its limit. I would  even dare say this is Princes best album. It is music made by a true  musician at the height of his prowess, someone who was not afraid to push  the boundary.<br />Highly recommended.
B00003CX5A|4.0|Who'da thunk it?  This story is so much more than the one we've had thrown at us by the goofballs at Disney.  The Disney interpretation is so pale,  that I never even thought to read the book.  Well, it looks like Tim Burton  has read it.<br />Few directors are able to tell a story as deliberately as  this character.  I always enjoy his work, even if I don't enjoy the story.   But what a plus when the story's really fun as well?  I saw this on  pay-per-view, then I watched a tape - twice, I watched it again when my  sister rented it - now I'm buying the DVD.  The more I see it, the more  enjoyable it becomes.  Burton really stands up to scrutiny.  And I'm  grateful to have this new interpretation of the story available to  me.<br />Plus, this movie is just plain fun!
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson really shows what he can do in the movie.  Braveheart is the most realistic movie of this era.  The special effects are wonderful.  This  is really a movie that must be watched a few times so you catch everything.   You will be so surprised when you notice everything you missed the first  and second time.  I am recommending this movie to the fullest!
B000001EL7|4.0|1977 was probably KISS's most sucessful year in their career.In March,KISS had caught on in Japan.In April,Beth shares a people's choice award with Disco Duck for best song of the year(This has been a subject of debate between me and other fans in regards to this area. There have been fans who have told me that it wasn't Disco Duck that Beth shared the award with. They have said that it was Rod Stewart's Tonight's The Night (Gonna Be Alright)was the song that shared the award with Beth. If anyone knows the real and right answer, please leave a comment in the comments section with the real and right answer and I will edit the review to make it more accurate and correct). In June, Marvel launches the KISS COMIC BOOK.Created by Steve Gerber,each member donates their own blood to the red ink as a way to promote it.<br /><br />While all of this was going on,KISS was hard at work on their sixth studio album.They kept the services of  Eddie Kramer while the band(again in particular Gene and Paul)assisted.Love Gun was released in September of the same year.It quickly climbs to #4 and is their third platinum album.Thanks to advance orders,it's KISS's highest charting album until Psycho Circus in 1998.<br /><br />Gene contributes four more songs(Christeen Sixteen,Got Love For Sale,Almost Human and Plaster  Caster).Paul contributes two(I Stole Your Love and title track).Making up  for his absence on Rock and Roll Over is Ace Frehley(Shock Me).Another  Peter Criss and Stan Penridge collaboration(Hooligan).The cover tune is  Then She Kissed Me.<br /><br />Ace makes his vocal debut on Shock Me(it's about time). Peter turns in another solid vocal job on Hooligan.Gene and Paul do lead on the rest of the album.Ace shows he's a very good vocalist on Shock  Me.We also know that we'll be hearing more from him in the near  future.<br /><br />As for the songs,they are as uninhibited as ever.The title song  has Paul telling a girl he has something to make her happy. Christeen  Sixteen isyet another bold effort by Gene.It's about an elderly man who's  in love with a teenage girl.Plaster Caster continues his boldness with him  crooning that his female lover needs him to cast his \\"impression\\"  in plaster to remind her of him when he's on the road.Shock Me has Ace telling a woman to dress her sexiest to get him ready.These and the rest of  the songs are an example of the band building up their stage repertoire.The  songs are typical KISS.But are much bolder and more exciting.They are also as memorable as their previous songs. The only exception is the Then She  Kissed Me remake.Though Paul does a fair job on vocals,it would've been  better if Peter did the lead on this.This song was right up Peter's  alley(so to speak).The original songs preceeding this make up for this  shortcoming.<br /><br />Kramer and the band deliver an album with a more polished  sound than Dressed To Kill and Rock and Roll Over(see  reviews)combined.They're at their most infectious.Eddie gets another A+ for  his efforts.KISS rocks as hard as they can rock.When you put this album in  your CD player,you'll have a rocking good time.<br /><br />So KISS fans  everywhere.Pick up the Love Gun and knock yourselves out.No fan should be  without it.
0891349553|5.0|I sculpt animals but, in my fashion, haven't stopped to figure out volume  and proportion, etc., instead working until &quot;it looks right&quot;.   Thank you Kathy, I know my work will benefit from your analytical/artistic  mentality.
0425173895|3.0|OK, maybe there is something wrong with me, but I did not like Hercule  Poirot.  And I thought from time to time that the murderer may in fact be  who it turned out to be but I just couldn't see why.  And like I said in my  review of &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;, I don't believe Christie  made the motive believable.  I got a kick out of Caroline though.<br />I had  purchased a third Christie before I read this one, and I exchanged it for  something else.  I just don't find her stories, or rather, the motives  believable.
0792148061|5.0|What a great movie.  Ordinarily, I can't tolerate musicals.  There's something about the way that people are just standing there talking and  then all of a sudden break into song.  It's laughable under most  circumstances.  Grease breaks that mold a little bit.  All the musical  numbers-and there are some great ones-never interfere with the flow of the  movie and that's one of the reasons I like this movie so much.  Of course,  having Olivia Newton-John in tight black leather pants at the end doesn't  hurt.  This movie portrays high school life like we would all like it to  be-a special time in our lives that's filled with lots of fun with our  friends, nothing gets taken too seriously, and everything works out in the  end.  I'm reviewing the widescreen version because it, like so many other  movies, is much more impressive in its original state.  I know some people  don't like the little black bands on the top and bottom of their T.V.  screens, but look at it this way-you will be watching it in the way that  the makers of the movie always intended it to be.
B00004U45G|5.0|The pairing was inevitable, and it's about time. The greatest  rock&amp;roll band left on the planet with one of rock guitar's innovators.  The tracks are bang on, and while the Zeppelin tunes seem a little cautious  ( I mean they are playing his songs, for chrisakes!), the blues numbers and  lesser known covers kick! Shapes of Things is cool, and a tip of the hat  for Oh Well, by oft-overlooked Peter Green. Kudos! Great discs.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I totally love this album. It's worth every penny you have...trust me. TOM  is the best, he's hot and a great musician. I love him. Mark and Travis are  great too!! I love their music to death and i suggest this for everyone!
0425129586|4.0|This was my first Agatha Christie book.  I knew she was the famed  &quot;best selling mystery writer&quot; and I guess when you hear all the  hype your expectations soar.  While the book wasn't bad, I found some of it  perplexing and somewhat difficult to swallow.  While the motive was sneaky,  I didn't feel that Christie persuaded me enought to make it believable.  None the less, I tried another book...&quot;The Murder of Roger  Ackroyd&quot;.  Please look up that book to see my review on it.
6304539282|5.0|Everyone knows the characters and probably what happens in all three of these movies, and if you don't I guess you've been in a cave or in a coma.  These movies-Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of  the Jedi- are quite simply put, my absolute favorite movies of all time.  Don't automatically assume I'm some Sci-fi fanatic or weirdo either.  In  reality, I don't care for most sci-fi stuff.  I can't really put a finger  on one specific reason I love the Star Wars trilogy so much, but I think  one of the main reasons is it brings me back to my childhood in a lot of  ways.  I was nine when the first one came out and it was love at first  sight.  So many memorable scenes and characters.  Too many to mention here,  certainly.  Like most kids, I wanted to see the good guys win and win they  did.  Darth Vader is one of the most memorable screen villains of all time,  too.  He's not sleezy and sadistic like so many of the one-dimensional bad  guys you see today.  I hate to say too much about the movie because I  wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it(if there is anyone  out there who hasn't seen it!)  Let me just say that if you have  intentionally not watched this movie because you don't think you would like  the space stuff, just give it a try.  It has so much more to offer than  that.
6305622825|3.0|This movie was actually kind of confusing to me. I think that there should of been a good chase scene. what is  a suspense with out a chase scene. The  people did too much talking and not enough action. Also did anyone else  notice that Catherine Zeta-Jones had about 7 different hairstyles and 10  different outfits. Are we acting here or putting on a fashion show? You  tell me. Also Sean Connery doesn't look good for his age. Stop making him  younger than he is. The movie has it's good parts when they had to seal the  mask and when they had to cross to the next buliding while hanging on for  their lives. However, I didn't leave the movie theatre like that was good.  when it was over I was just like o.k. I think it needed something more.
158234082X|5.0|I read the book on a long flight and enjoyed it. He is  colorful writer  and person. I would like a companion book and map with all the places he  discusses in the book - you'll feel the same way.
B000035P7X|5.0|If you are a Dylan fan, then you will have already seen Don't Look Back, but this is a great version of it.  It has been well restored, and the  extra scenes and commentary make it well worth seeing again (and  owning).<br />If you are not a Dylan fan - this is a must buy.  Learn why so  many people are enthralled with Bob's music, and see him while he was young  and arguably at his best.
B00003ZA27|4.0|The chorus may not be faultless but the solo singing is really incredibly  beautiful, they make a fine team. Try the &quot;credo&quot;-duet for  soprano and alto to see just how beautiful they match.  The orchestra is  faultless and accompany well. In a sense the chorus give the reading a  ruggedness that isn't always inappropriate. Sometimes it makes for very  dramatic moments such as the &quot;Donna nobis pacem&quot; which is almost  overwhelming in it's intensity and religious feeling. The sound in this new  transfer (20 bit reprocessed) is such an improvement over the previous it  sounds as if a thick layer of varnish was removed. This helps the solos and  duets and also gives the chorus much greater presence. This is a wonderful  recording and a wonderful way to get to know this incredible music. Don't  be fooled by bad reviews, hear for yourself!
6305265488|5.0|This movie is both original and creative. Ever After is great movie that teaches you about life. It shows you how you can be strong and overcome any  obstacle. you can reach your dreams if you just believe. You will be  touched by the story of Danielle who was oppressed but stood up for what  she believed in. Danielle is strong, smart and kind. This is what girls she  strive to be. Instead a stuppid Britany Spears or Chirstina Aguleria!  I love everything about this movie from the characters to the  costumes,scenary and music. The music is absolutely beautiful!  It will  make you cry. Ever After is a sure classic. I own both the movie and  soundtrack. there's nothing negative in the movie.It's for all ages. Go see  Ever After today and see for yourself what a great movie it is. This is the  way movies are meant to be!  FIVE STARS !
B00003CXDU|4.0|Not only is this a clever and very funny parody of Star Trek, that doesn't try to be nauseatingly hilarious, but it's also a pretty good action movie  in its own right.  The scenes of washed-up actors doing endless convention  appearances give the characters much more depth than you usually find in a  parody.
0767819594|4.0|It is a shame that this film is famed for a lesbian kiss, because that one moment seems to overshadow the rest of this creative, amusing, and utterly  enthralling film about two manipulative step-siblings and their eventual  downfalls. This film is essentially about Sebastian making a bet with his  step-sister and object of obsession Kathryn that he can get celibate virgin  Annette into bed. If he loses? She gets his '56 Jaguar Roadster. But if he  wins? He gets to 'put it anywhere', so to speak, and I'm not talking about  the car anymore. Great premise, if not morally warped. If that doesn't  appeal to your dark sense of humour, then this isn't the film for you.  Otherwise, read on...<br />Ryan Philippe plays Sebastian cool and subtle as the  sensualist with a heart of lead, a character imbued with such manipulative  charm that you cannot help but like him. Reese Witherspoon, Philippe's  real-life wife, amazingly resists the 'butter-wouldn't-melt' stereotype  associated with such a moralistic role and is an intriguing balance to  Sebastian's icy charisma. But it is Sarah Michelle Gellar, old Buffy  herself, who steals the show as the promiscuous cocaine addict Kathryn, all  at once sultry and evil and incredibly alluring. The sexual chemistry  between Gellar and Philippe is electric, every scene that they share  infused with an air of sensual arousal that is clearly created by the  actors' own youthful hormones running wild. As far as putting feelings onto  film is concerned, these scenes fully convey their lustful platonic  relationship as an almost tangible emotion, and it is this that is the  film's starring grace.<br />The story swings and bounds as two stories in one,  Sebastian's quest for sex and Kathryn's attempted revenge upon innocent  boyfriend-stealing Cecile merging into one engaging twisted schematic.  There was always, of course, the risk of the ending becoming schmaltzy  (Philippe, inevitably, realising he truly does love Ms. Witherspoon, like  all good Hollywood fare), but, despite Sebastian's evident change of heart,  the false sentimentality of this is, thankfully, avoided. Not overly  cleverly, mind, for it does not sit well with the rest of the story, but  the final scene of Kathryn's downfall fully redeem it, as The Verve's  'Bittersweet Symphony' plays triumphantly in the foreground. It is truly  one of those classic movie moments, up there with the greats.<br />Obviously,  Cruel Intentions is not a realistic film. It is deliciously overblown in  the way that 'Wild Things' is overblown, but that does not mean that it's a  bad film. Critics have been far too harsh; it's not meant to be taken as a  serious representation of teenage life, it's about a bunch of rich kids  getting their kicks by playing with other rich kids. Flashy, sexy,  entertaining and memorable, you could do much worse than owning a copy of  this. And the lesbian kiss is kind of cool...good Hollywood fare), but, despite Sebastian's evident change of heart,  the false sentimentality of this is, thankfully, avoided.

B00000K2SD|4.0|I do not agree with the violent content in this movie. However the special effects were off the hook. When I first went to go see this movie I didn't  know what to expect. Everything was a surprise. They didn't give away  anything in the previews.Which is good. this is where most movies fail. I  found myself still talking about this movie a month after I saw it. I  couldn't get it out of my mind. I've never seen a movie like it in my life.  I'm still unclear of what the matrix is because I think It's more complex  than a simple definition.The only bad thing about the movie is that the  violence should of been replaced by martial arts. then it would of been  hype. However, the people in Hollywood can't stop the urge to just shoot  things up. They glamourized guns in this movie. And I saw kids in the movie  theatre!  It could of had 5 stars if it wasn't so violent.
B000002LGW|4.0|Of course, if you don't like electronic or synthesizer music or if you're allergic to the sound of the 80's, this album is definitely not for  you.<br />Otherwise, you'll probably enjoy this stupendous live album.  Contrary to what some reviewers have said, I didn't constantly vibrate with  the public, and I even found some passages rather tedious, cacophonous  (&quot;Stripped&quot;, &quot;Pleasure Little Treasure&quot;, &quot;Master  and Servant&quot;) or, even worse, not equal to the original; I was notably  disappointed by their version of Strangelove.<br />But the rest! My God, the  rest is brilliant! &quot;Shake the disease&quot; and &quot;People are  people&quot; have more rhythm than the singles they are extracted from.  &quot;I just can't get enough&quot; is still naive but DM has so much  pleasure to singing it (it hears!) that you follow the crowd in the spiral  and share their enthusiasm. <br />I particularly appreciated  &quot;Nothing&quot; and &quot;Never let me down again&quot;, they rock!  &quot;Something to do&quot; and &quot;Blasphemous rumours&quot; are great  moments, the melody is entertaining and efficient and you'll surprise  yourself to sing them again under the shower or at a bus station from time  to time. <br />Now, attention! Here are the best parts. Both CDs end with two  unforgettable jewels. <br />The first one occurs when the piano from the  lovely and highly emotional &quot;Somebody&quot; fades away to make place  to a bizarre languishing sound, almost nasty, signaling that the harrowing  &quot;Things you said&quot; is already starting. The mysterious intro  creates so strong a contrast with the previous song that it chills you.  This odd atmosphere remains until the very last note, causing this track to  be really remarkable. <br />The very last track is a triumph and is likely to  stay in your head a long time. &quot;Everything counts&quot; is undoubtedly  my favorite for a bunch of reasons. The words are intelligent, deep, thoughvery ironic, the rhythm and the melody are irresistible, DM gives all its  heart for this grand finale and the public is so happy, they feel so close  to the band that you LIVE it, you BELIEVE it and you sing and sing again  the chorus and soon the couplets. You become the public by yourself and  like the crowd that, long after DM has finished the song, repeats  continuously &quot;The grabbing hands, Grab all they can, Everything counts  in large amounts! &quot;, I can tell you, the tune is also on your lips  long after the crowd has stopped cheering. This song, despite the lyrics,  makes you feel good and, just for this incredible moment that should have  been neat for those who were at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, I wish I had been  there on that day!
0784011796|2.0|as a friend of mine said. The storyline is simplistic, which would be no problem were the imagery not so overused and the dialogue not so terrible  (&quot;But maybe it's genius!&quot;--perhaps the director's wistful  thoughts on his own film?). <br />Maybe this is why the movie is as bad as it  is: it mixes the storyline of the quest to know the secrets of the universe  with a bunch of paranoiac gibberish. It doesn't focus enough on the  emotional and spiritual consequences of Max's quest to know the mind of  God. We never get enough sense of Max Cohen as a character to empathize  with him. Hence my feeling that the movie is juvenile, because it puts him  through a lot without allowing us to feel with him.
6305907145|1.0|OK, I have to admit that I have not read the book, however, I disliked the movie for its own sake. The love interest had no personality (and was  slightly incestuous as well - blegh). No one's personality was well  developed and the plot was SLOW. In addition, they mention slavery but  really do not go into it. Fanny finds out that the Lord is an abuser of  slaves and then she just drops it! Is the older brother against slavery or  just a drunk? And why don't they ever show his face? The ending was weird  as well, like they ran out of money, just show 1 minute of people sitting  around while Fanny says &quot;It could have happened differently but it  didn't&quot; many times. Plus a movie about slavery without ANY slaves! I  didn't mind the lesbianism, I thought that it was the only interesting part  of the movie. Plus, there was a lot of talk of education, but no one  teaching - how did Fanny learn anything? so much wrong for a single movie.
B000002H97|5.0|This album is phenomenal, a change of style for Metallica and the new  style is somewhat an improvement. This may not be as good as Master of  Puppets but non-the-less this is still one of the albums of the decade.  Every single song is a classic. Brilliant lyrics, instrument playing and  vocals. I also think it is the best production seen on any album. The drums  are especially powerful on playback. Simply put: this is a must buy.
B00000IOSU|5.0|These highlights from her live concert series are enhanced by applause, a sing-along, and remarks by Sarah after a couple of the songs.  I hope to  hear more song introductions and short narrations in live albums in the  future -- this allows us to get to know the artist better, and helps  explain the meaning of the songs.  The CD includes a booklet with all the  lyrics, another big plus, since not all the words are clear in the songs.   This is the first Popular Music CD I've bought since Simon and Garfunkel,  and I felt right at home.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is a phenomenal album. It starts with an acoustic riff and, as usual  it breaks out into a monster riff!! Some of Metallica's greatest songs are  on this album including the emotional Fade to Black, and the concert  favourites - For Whom The Bell Tolls and Creeping Death. The progression is  great on this album and is especially shown off on the truly phenomenal  'The Call OF Ktulu' which is one of if not the greatest instrumental I have  had the pleasure to hear(the main rival is Orion on Master of Puppets).  Simply put- Great musicmanship, great lyrics and great creativity. Get It  Now!!!!!
6305280711|5.0|Yippy ki-ay *&amp;^*$@#! It's non-stop action from beginning to end. Now, I'm not trying to take anything away from the first two, but this film has  a bomb going off during the opening title sequence! How much better does it  get? John McTiernan also brings back the original flare that was somehow  left out of Die Hard 2. (Ok, so I'm not a big fan of Die Hard 2, different  director). By the way, the amazing Dakota--Benz chase and a few others were  filmed in Charleston, South Carolina, my home town. If somehow you are a  Die Hard fan and missed this film, you need to get off your computer chair  and go buy this movie on DVD, it's totally worth it (really.......)
B000002H33|5.0|Where do I start? Lyrics- Brilliant. Instrument playing- Awesome. Inventivity- Phenomenal. Ok lets do song by song-<br />Battery - 5/5 Awesome  intro, awesome riff. Great lyrics. Great progression.<br />Master of Puppets -  5/5 Well its hard to say anything negative about my favourite song ever.  But ok- This starts with a great pumping riff. Goes on about affects of  drugs. Then gets into the mid section which includes two great solos-one  slow and one fast. In between these is a great intro to the second solo  which is my fave solo of all time. And goes on further about drugs along  the main riff(which is also my fave riff of all time! ) then it ends  brilliantly with laughter. Simply put - AWESOME! <br />The Thing That  Should Not Be - 5/5 Some black album stlye riffing here(which is good!) and  some great lyrics and great construction.<br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - 5/5  The semi-ballad(sort of) of the album which progresses into some great  riffing and soloing and not to mention the brilliant lyrics.<br />Disposable  Heroes - 5/5 The album cover is based upon this song; and what a song!   awesome thrashing!  and the lyrics suit the song and the cover(after all  the album was going to be called disposable heroes). The riffing is  phenomenal and the progression is great, as is the song structure. <br />Leper  Messiah - 5/5 One of my fave riffs. Some great guitar work here and great  lyrics. An awesome song!<br />Orion (instrumental) - 5/5 Some great musicman  ship here. Only the best of bands can pull off an instrumental as good as  this. Progression is great also; but the ending dissapoints with the fading  out(I hate those kind of endings)<br />Damage, INC. - 5/5 Full on thrashing at  its best!  Some awesome destructive instrument playing and lyrics. This  album goes out with a big bang! <br />In short- The best(in my opinion)  Metallica studio album(S&amp;M is my fave).<br />GET IT NOW!
630438551X|4.0|This, while not the best rendition of Shakespeare (see Mel Gibson's Hamlet or Anthony Hopkins in Titus) is nevertheless a great movie.  When I first  saw it in theatres I saw the type of people that you would never expect to  see in the audience for a Shakespeare movie.   I thoroughly enjoyed it and  respect the re-envisioning of Shakespeare's tragedy as well as respect the  effect it has as a great introduction to Shakespeare.
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice For All-Metallica at their most complex. This album starts  with the amazing intro of Blackened, then blasts into the main riff. This  is a typical example of any song here. But these aren't just verse chorus  verse type songs; these are progressive behemoths. And Metallica were  always not just about thrashing, they were about making great compositions.  I think Cliff has left a lasting impression on metallica with his classical  music up-bringing. This enhances the music greatly and makes it more  exciting. The musicmanship is flawless; but I wish I could say the same for  the mixing; the bass is virtually inaudible. Saying that the album doesn't  suffer much without it; the guitars are fabulous and the drums are crisp  and powerful. Without doubt the best song is One; a creeping song that  builds up on you from an acoustic intro with feelings in the lyrics.  Nearing the end, it bursts into an Electric beast or a riff, with lyrics of  just wanting it all to end in a violent fashion. Then comes a riproaring  solo that fits the song.  In short; this album is nothing short of  excellent, a must buy in all respects- GET IT!!!
B000002J0B|5.0|I like this album and find it extremely fascinating.  It is certainly one  of the most interesting and enigmatic albums to be released by a  mainstream, popular band.  In the short five year period from 1968-1973,  Led Zeppelin had been prolific by any measure.  They were constantly  touring, and still managed to realease four landmark Rock and Roll albums,  three top 20 hits, and STAIRWAY to HEAVEN, the rock anthem of that decade.   Now, in late 1972, the first chapter of Led Zeppelin was coming to a close.   HH would be the last album on the Atlantic label; 1974 would see not a  single public appearance of the band, and Robert Plant would undergo vocal  surgery.  So, HH is a document of a band in transition as it looks back on  successes of the scale never seen before in the entertainment world, and  forward to discover new musical directions.  It all starts with the cult of  the album.  It is a shame the graphics on this album have been reduced to a  small piece of paper in a CD jewel case.  It is worth a trip to a used  record store to see the gatefold album colour as it was intended.  The  artwork on an album was an important part of the product in the early  seventies, and Hipgnosis does a splendid job.  The images are at once,  attractive, forbidding, strange, familiar, haunting and indecipherable,  even though they are only of children playing on rocks.  This is the first  album from LZ with an explicit title; yet, you would be hard-pressed to  find the name of the band.  The album is a creature of its time in that  each side is a complete experience or show.  The CD undermines this, but it  is not difficult to exhume.  Each side consists of a four song set in which  the first song is a high energy rocker (THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME &amp;  DANCING DAYS) In fact, TSRTS was the opening number for the 1973 tour.  The  fourth song on each side is a show closer in the tradition of HOW MANY MORE  TIMES which was replaced by WHOLE LOTTA LOVE after the Bath Festivalof  1971.  At the end of their shows, LZ would use these songs as starting  points for a medley of favourites which would include Rock, Blues, even the  Beatles.  THE CRUNGE is an uabashed acknowledgement of James Brown, and the  band is having a great time.  THE OCEAN, as is well-known refers to their  audiences, which had become so large they resembled a sea of humanity.  It  was used as an encore in the '73 tours, and is an intimate piece of an  artist singing about his relationship with his fans.  It also includes a  mention of Robert Plant's young daughter.  It would not due to leave the  OCEAN without mentioning that this is the one where Bonzo  &quot;sings&quot;.  In between these songs the band introduces new ideas,  an extremely gutsy move in the pop world.  Nothing is the same.  TSRTS  starts with an introduction of Page on a double-necked guitar while he  creates a &quot;massive guitar orchestration.&quot;  A surprise attack for  which almost none of the pundits were prepared.  THE RAIN SONG is a quiet  piece of sappy pop love lyrics which introduced the melotron, and is a  showpiece for Page's doublenecked guitar.  STAIRWAY was actually not  recorded with that instrument.  OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY is one of the  many jokes in this album.  The title refers to an unfavourable response,  &quot;Would you please play OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY.&quot; ;-)  It  opens with one of Page's most memorable and deceptively simple sounding  licks.  While it is a variation on a theme of the Yardbird's tune WHITE  SUMMER which Page wrote, it foreshadows more of what is to come as Page  builds his &quot;guitar orchestra&quot;.  D'YER MAK'ER is one of the most  misunderstood titles in the LZ catalogue.  It is a contraction of &quot;Did  You Make Her?&quot; (if you don't know what that means, ask your lover).   Spoken quickly, it sounds like &quot;Jamaica&quot; the homeland of Bob  Marley, who was stirring things up in London in the early seventies.  It's  a fun Raggaenumber.  NO QUARTER is the piece which has endured the test of  time. A John Paul Jones showpiece.  Ironic that the album by that title did  not feature JPJ at all.  Plant would introduce this as a &quot;subduey  piece about one of the journeys.&quot;  It contains the mystical vein which  fascinated Robert, as can been heard in RAMBLE ON, IMMIGRANT SONG, and  BATTLE of EVERMORE.  NQ replaced DAZED &amp; CONFUSED as the extended,  experimental, instrumental song.  By the time LZ hit LA in 1977, NQ had  evolved into a captivating conversation between Page and JPJ's piano.  For  the NQ tour in the 90's, Page &amp; Plant played it alone sans band and  orchestra.  Another piece which grips the past, shakes it loose from any  shackles and sends it to the future.  I experience something different each  time I hear these songs.  It is a work of music which reveals as much about  the perfomers as it does about the listerners.  Here's hoping you don't  loose your way.
6305363668|5.0|By show of hands- how many people saw the original version? If you did thats good, if you didn't thats good too. Not much was changed from the  original to this version- the narration was cut, a two second vision was  added, and the ending was cut down a little bit. While I felt that the  narration was very important to the movie, the lack of narration REALLY  makes the roof scene at the climax of the movie MUCH more powerful. If have  not seen the movie then you are in for a treat of some of the best writing  in any movie to date and acting to match, I would recommend this movie to  everyone. The violence is not to intense and the nudity is very brief and  not sexual (you see someone changing her shirt). While a bit disterbing for  some younger viewers, this is the perfect movie to own on video.
0783117523|5.0|If you are an Angelina Jolie fan, this may already be your all-time favorite AJ performance.  If you are not an AJ fan yet, you will be after  you see this amazing true story drama of Gia Marie Carangi.  Gia grew up in  Philadelphia, her parents had seperated when she was young which had left  her looking for real love the rest of her life.  She later met Wilhemina  Cooper who became her modeling agent, and Gia's life took off from there.   Gia also meets the woman of her dreams, and their romance throughout the  movie was breathless and also slightly tear-jerking.  Aside Angelina's  powerful performance, she was well supported with great co-stars including  Elizabeth Mitchell who played &quot;Linda&quot; Gia's love.  It is a  Romance that can never be forgotten.  -This is a must see movie.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I saw Dido in concert when she opened for Sting and I was really  impressed.  She has a very beautiful voice and an obvious talent for  songwritting.   She credits her entre into the industry from the influence  she received from Sting.  Remember her name, she is going places.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Pay no attention to whatever critic asserted that this album should have &quot;remained in solitary.&quot;  The LP version was my first Johnny Cash  album; I've since collected them all, but this new CD takes first place.  What a show!<br />Cash purists who've seen the Granada TV special made in  conjunction with the album know that this CD is neither  &quot;complete&quot; nor &quot;uncensored.&quot;  At least two songs are  missing: &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot; and &quot;Jackson.&quot;  (At  three different places on the disc you can hear convicts calling out the  latter title; rest assured Cash and his wife did oblige them.)  An  off-color remark Cash made to a TV cameraman at the close of &quot;I Walk  the Line&quot; has been trimmed.  Also, unlike last year's  &quot;At Folsom  Prison&quot; reissue, the selections here are not in original running  order.  But knowing this diminishes neither the importance of what IS here,  nor the CD's enjoyment factor.<br />This album marked the debut of lead  guitarist Bob Wootten, who'd replaced the late Luther Perkins, originator  of Cash's &quot;boom-chicka-boom&quot; backing.  Wootten was never hotter  than during his first year with the troupe, and his double-timed licks add  to the sense of wild urgency that permeates the concert.  And vintage  rock-n-roll fans need to get this album if only to hear Carl Perkins.  In  addition to his licks on John Sebastian's &quot;Darling Companion&quot; and  the classic &quot;A Boy Named Sue,&quot; Perkins takes a verse of &quot;The  Old Account&quot; and displays the kind of southern-black vocal soul that  shows up Elvis for the pretender he was.  Eric Clapton, among others, knew  that Perkins was the real deal; the one verse here proves it.<br />But the  main event is Cash.  Rough-hewn, raw, unencumbered by neither the drugs of  earlier years nor the sense of religious responsibility to come, this is  the Man in Black's finest hour of the most successful year of his career.  It is THE Cash album to own.t is THE Cash album to own.
B00003Q43A|5.0|This movie is a blast! This movie has great special effects. Excellent story line and great new added scenes. The acting in this movie is good and  the actors also did an excellent job. BUY THIS DVD! BUY IT NOW! TRUST ME,  YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.
0783229887|5.0|Bride Of Chucky is an awesome horror film that's arguably the best of the entire Child's Play series.The special F/X are fantastic.Chucky has an a$$  kicking new look and the gore F/X are great and this is easily the grossest  of the series.Gore hounds will really love this one.The music by Rob Zombie  is  awesome and the film has gags and in-jokes galore.Buy this right  now.Can't wait for Seed Of Chucky (Child's Play 5).<br />Rated R for very very  gory violence and profanity galore.<br />PS: pay close attention to the  beginning in the police precinct.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is an awesome movie. The special effets are incredible. The storyline was original and inventive. The actors did an excellent job. Can't wait for  the sequel.
B0000025BL|5.0|Don't be fooled -- the cover may credit just Meat Loaf, but this is a Meat  Loaf/Steinman venture.  As has been proven, Meat's voice was made for  Steinman's songs, and this first collaboration delivers the goods to any  fan of rock as theater.<br />The ominous undertones of &quot;Bat out of  Hell&quot; make for 10 minutes of sheer power, rock and roll in its purest  form.  &quot;Hot summer night&quot; takes us back to adolescent love in the  '60s, and &quot;Paradise by the dashboard light&quot; encapsulates  everybody's First Time.  But my favorite on this disc is the strange  mini-symphony &quot;For Crying Out Loud,&quot; which puns on the title  phrase as an expression of frustration and a moan of ecstacy.  Only  Steinman could pull this off without it sounding like a silly stunt, and  only Meat could have the sincere emotion in his voice to sing it.<br />Highly  recommended for younger fans who know only the second Bat, and for any fan  of rock opera.  Not recommended for those who exclusively like quiet,  sincere, understated music.
B00004TDTO|5.0|This is a good movie to have at home. The acting in this movie is excellent and the huge great white shark was the best in the movie. Steven  Spielberg did an excellent job of making this movie and the actors did a  wonderful job. I really like the trivia game, The Making of Jaws and the  Deleted Scenes. They only have 2 outtakes and I was expecting more.
0380804557|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a master at what may be his own genre -- fairy tales for grown-ups.  His novel NeverWhere explored mythical concepts versus grown-up  cynicism at length, here he releases the conflict and lets the tale fall  how it may.<br />The result is lyrical, rhythmic prose that details the  fantastic story of half-fairy, half-human Tristran Thorn and his quest to  find a falling star and fulfill a rash promise to a pretty girl.  The  problem is that when he finds the star, *she* doesn't want to go back with  him.  And various third parties have taken a dangerous interest in the star  as well . . .<br />Part fairy tale, part romance, part fantasy, Stardust is  enchanting for any age reader (although you'll want to edit traces of  profanity and sex if you read it to young children).  It's smart and funny,  the characters are believable and likeable.<br />Stardust is an engrossing  trip to another world.  But be sure you get the illustrated edition with  Charles Vess' fantastic watercolors, or you're missing half the story.
B000002G7E|5.0|nothing could prepare me for, &quot;white light/white heat.&quot; you sort  of have to hear it for yourself to believe it. one sure thing i can tell  you, though, it's a lot stranger than, &quot;the velvet underground and  nico.&quot;<br />white light/white heat - unlike the debut, this album starts  off on an incredibly strange note, thus with the title track. it's a short  yet sweet song, with classic velvet underground insincerity that resonates  with originality.<br />the gift - john cale has most of the vocals on this  song, and that basically means him ranting poetry in a welsh accent over a  blues riff.<br />lady godiva's operation - this is a hell of a beautiful  song.<br />here she come's now - this is the only part of the album that  sounds a bit like the debut, which is sort of gritty pre-psychedelic  noise-rock. it definitely floats, however.<br />i heard her call my name - is  a loud and bluesy song, best when stoned.<br />sister ray - this is my  favorite song on the album, which is funny, since it clocks in at over 17  minutes!! it's consistent, though, and never keeps on being wonderful and  original.
B000002OYB|2.0|As we all learned with Midnight at the Lost and Found, Loaf - Steinman =  middling-to-bad album.  Now add a +Diane Warren, and you've got a date with  disaster.  Warren is not so much a songwriter as a cliche-database -- type  in your subject and she spews a lukewarm, familiar-sounding song about it.   Steinman takes chances with his wordplay and imagery, Warren never would.   So her three tracks sound like an imitation of a parody of Steinman's work.   <br />Steinman's two tracks are good but not his best.  Rounding out the  album are what sounds like a Van Halen B-side, an over-histrionic cover of  Tom Waits' sedate &quot;Martha,&quot; and a couple more Steinman knock-offs  interspersed with less-than-a-minute filler.<br />All of which leads me to one  conclusion: If it features Meat Loaf and the title does not include the  words &quot;Bat&quot; or &quot;Rocky Horror,&quot; leave it on the rack.
0515127485|4.0|Der Fuhrer is too horrible to be seen face-to-face in Harriss' debut novel &quot;Fatherland&quot;, and was only referred to by radio announcers.  In  &quot;Archangel&quot;, Harriss stokes the same idea from a different  perspective - obsession with the 20th century's other monster, the evil  Joseph Stalin.  As in &quot;Fatherland&quot; and &quot;Enigma&quot; (the  latter of the two is a great read when you consider it as a possible  prequel to the former), the unlikely hero is something of a detective - in  this case an historian.  But Harriss refuses to succumb to the  &quot;snobbery of chronology&quot; by which history is simply dismissed as  anything more important than an explanation for how we are today.  In  Harriss world, the past has a habit of finding its way back to the present  - whether it's the proof of genocide (Fatherland) or Soviet-backed  massacres (Enigma), nothing is ever consigned to history without a chance  to rear its head and spoil our ordered world.  In &quot;Archangel&quot;,  the past is Stalin and his reign of terror.  Post-Soviet Russia yearns for  direction and a clique of ex-Soviet generals and politicians remain  permanantly on the verge of returning the nation to soviet rule.  Even the  structures arranged by the Yeltsin government to create democracy have the  seeds of autocracy, and those who seek to prevent the rebirth of the KGB  may actually be following in its footsteps.  But it's business as usual for  the westerners who exploit Russia's resources and its potential for a  market.  The hero-historian, lead on to believe that the official story of  &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; may be incomplete, looks deeper into records and  finds that the dead dictator's legacy may yet be unrealized.  Helped -  sometimes pushed - by an American TV journalist and by the daughter of a  Stalinist security guard, the hero rtacks down the ephemeral clues -  stories and other conspiracy theories - for the hard evidence: a journal  pried out of Stalin's desk by Beria.  But even that prize isn't enough, and  the heroes head out to Archangel, the irradiated northern frontier of  Russia, where they confront, not only the truth, but their powerlessness  against it and (gasp) their own complicity in its realization.  &quot;Archangel&quot; arguably surpasses previous novels - though Harriss  has yet to draw a world as fully realized as post-war Berlin of  &quot;Fatherland&quot; - in that the story is built on the experiences of  flawed and credible charachters.  In any novel built on old stories told to  the main charachters, there is always the plot-weakness that the stories  may be completely fake.  Harriss deftly turns this into a strength by  highlighting a sort of intellectual obsession by which the human  charachters can't help but believe the stories.  This isn't as simple as  the obsession of Harriss previous charachters (in Fatherland, the hero is  shocked to learn that his warm socks were knit from the hair of  concentration camp victims; the cryptoanalyst in &quot;Enigma&quot; was  motivated by love and the need to save England from the U-Boats), and the  obsession drives the book.  When one of those stories recounts Lavrenti  Beria's last day at work, expecting to take over Stalin's job, the  obsession becomes palpable.  The former KGB boss, as Harriss descibes him,  has no idea what's waiting for him within the Kremlin.  History tells us he  should have called in sick that morning.  But who'll warn us not repeat  Beria's mistakes?by Beria.

B000002OMN|5.0|Steinman and Meat Loaf return to give grunge-rock a firm kick to the groin  with this throwback to arena-rock days.  Meat's voice is in top form, and  Steinman is at the best of his song-writing ability.  <br />The strength of  the album is the way disparate elements play off each other -- the way the  piano line breaks through the heavy-distortion guitar on &quot;Anything for  Love,&quot; or how the guitar bisects the vocals on &quot;It just won't  quit.&quot;  <br />Steinman tackles producing duties as well, and his  arrangements here are unequaled.  He piles on instrument on instrument,  repetition on repetition, until each song approaches epic proportions (not  a track under 5 minutes).<br />Is it a little corny?  Sure.  Bombastic?   Absolutely (but when did bombastic become an insult?).  But it's undeniably  fun, expertly performed, and perfect for fans of the genre.  That genre  being theatrical rock, for want of a better term.<br />For a heavier, more  pure example of this type of sound, check out Savatage and Trans-Siberian  Orchestra's rock operas.  Also, Steinman produced several tracks for  Sisters of Mercy, most notably This Corrosion, which are also worth a  listen.
B00003W8NM|2.0|A good looking movie. Edward Norton is always watchable. The plot is absolutely different. We're rooting for this underdog theme. But in the  final round,the audience is hit with a low blow that can only be vocalized  as disbelief on a grand scale. If you watch it at home, it's an interesting  failure. But for me at ringside, I was robbed.
B000003S2K|5.0|I love this record, so I'm a bit biased. It's an odd sort of record and  here's why: <br />You are not meant to actually LISTEN to the record in the  way you would listen to pop songs or classical or jazz. <br />The best way to  appreciate this very **functional** music is to play it as the background  to whatever you are doing. It's a sort of wallpaper, really. The album's  rich bass notes and tinkly, subdued piano and choirs create a perfect  background to any sort of sound. It's a sensation a bit like being  reincarnated or waking up after a sleep long several years. Your spoken  words seem to echo in a weird, golden way and normal household noises and  street traffic seem to blend in perfectly with the record. It's truly great  stuff to relax with in that it doesn't TAKE anything from you, it just  gives. I like playing it during candlelit dinner parties or when having a  long bath. I'm sure that it'd be wonderful stuff to listen to at an airport  as well.<br />This is &quot;ambient&quot; music in the sense that the music is  designed to construct an environment of its very own. It isn't simply   &quot;pretty&quot; music such as Celtic or acoustic music can be. This  record was created to blend in with whatever is happening and create its  own &quot;ambience&quot;. The music doesn't **compete** with other sounds,  it boosts and enhances them.
630018403X|5.0|This movie has &quot;classic&quot; written all over it. John Hughes wrote and directed this film about five high school kids forced to spend a  Saturday in detention together. Their punishment: to write an essay on who  they think they are. They are, most simply put, the jock, Andrew (Emilio  Estivez), the brain, Brian (Michael Anthony Hall), the princess, Claire  (Molly Ringwald), the freak, Allison (Ally Sheedy), and the criminal,  Bender, (Judd Nelson). At first they see themselves and each other as their  steryotypes, but as they spend their eight hours together, they come to see  that they are not that different from one another. They are all struggling  with their problems and issues, their own fears and doubts about their  lives ahead. They become friends. They become The Breakfast Club.
B00004XMVL|5.0|This movie is one of the best ive seen in a long time.  Its CGI is amazing and very well done.  The story is gripping and scary enough to keep you  jumping, and character developement (for those that live LOL) is really  good.  Ive been waiting since February for it to come out on video, and it  has been a long, agonizing wait.  I highly recommend this to anyone, but  since all do not share my personal views, i would suggest renting it first.   Oh, and if you missed it in theaters, i pity you.
B000000OUJ|5.0|For the true hip hop fans (Excluding Mr. wang), The GZA doesn't  disappoint. This is a must have album. The beats are tight and the rhymes  are original and exceptionally philosophical. This album is not for the  faint hearted or for R &amp; B Fanatics. Keep the good work GZA. Whilst  others are like Will Smith are busy producing commercial beats GZA is  continuing to deliver authentic rhymes which are far ahead of their time.
0783240287|5.0|. A friend of mine recommended this DVD to me and it took me a while to finally get it. I'm not very into theater and I wasn't sure if I was going  to like this video or not but I got it anyway. Now I'm sorry I didn't get  it sooner!<br />I got my package with several DVDs I had ordered but the other  had to wait because I immediately watched 'Joseph' and I just ADORED it!  The music is fantastic and so catchy. I was talking about the movie so much  during dinner that my family wanted to watch it (even if they don't speak  English) and my family loved it as much as I did. Now this DVD is one of  the family's favorites. From my 4 year old niece to my 50 year old dad, we  all enjoyed it the same.<br />I would recommend this DVD to anyone. It's a  great addition to any video library.<br />I guess my only complaining would be  that the sound quality of the DVD is not that good but the show is so good  that it's enjoyable anyway.<br />My favorite characters were Joseph and the  Narrator. I think they make a GREAT couple. But the rest of the cast is  wonderful too. I LOVE this DVD! .
6304383827|5.0|Ok, I haven't read the book, but I loved this movie. Gweneth Paltrow shines as Emma. I think anyone who loves old fashioned romance and movies  based on historical settings will love this movie. It has both in a great  combination.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This film was one of the best sci-fi genre films I've ever seen, capturing the essence of the aliens series as well as the playout of a Stephen King  novel (Storm Of The Century comes to mind here).  I walked into this movie  blind, watching it for the first time in a hotel room at a conference in  Phoenix.  I had never even heard of the film before.  As stated in a  previous review, this will (due to marketing or other reasons) go down as  one of the most underappreciated films of the year.  A definite addition to  my DVD collection.  This film left movies like &quot;Mimic&quot; and  &quot;The Relic&quot; in the dust as sci-fi horror goes and the monsters in  this film seemed as mysterious and vicious as the unknown sentience in  &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;.  <br />The only downside I see for this  movie (other than a relatively typical sci-fi plot) is that there isn't a  Criterion Collection version scheduled for release.  For a film like this,  the more trimmings that are added to the DVD the better.
B00000IGGA|5.0|My grandpa used to wake me with a song everyday.  He would use his sweet,  soulfull, scratchy voice to wake up the sun.  This recording takes me back  to those times. It controls all of my emotions and moods and I gladly let  it.  This is a trance inducing record. The beats, the words, his voice take  over and don't let go until well after the last track has played.  If you  have never heard Tom Waits before, this is a good place to start!
B00004SCX6|4.0|OK I know a lot of people think that Britney Spears is fake, but what most people don't understand is that she really works hard to make music that  all groups of people enjoy, it's not her fault that she is really  beautiful, and a lot of people only like her for that.  She has really  worked hard to get here. I really like her new Album especially Lucky.  And  I think she earned the fame she is getting!
0440224764|2.0|Great entertainment for the first three quarters; then Patrick's \\"failure  proof\\" planning begins to get annoying-something should go wrong here and  there.  The international banking, spycraft, the legal maneuvers, etc. are  wild and exciting-I don't know if it's \\"authentic\\", but Grisham makes it  read wonderfully.  The ending is strictly amateur night.  It's like someone  said, \\"we need a twist here\\" and the author tacked one on-it pretty much  ruined the reading experience for me.
0671034065|4.0|I have read all of Linda Howard's books. My all-time favorite was  Mackenzie's Mountain which is almost an impossible act to follow. Mr.  Perfect had some wonderful dialogue, great love scenes, and a fast pace.  While I agree with some of your reviewers that the character's were  underdeveloped (as was the relationship between the main characters) I  certainly would purchase this book because it has so much to offer.  It has  humor, sadness, great love scenes and a decent plot.  Granted the plot was  somewhat predictable but give Linda a chance! This is not the pure romance  of the Harlequin series but suspense/romance!  And I disagree with several  of your reviewers that the relationship was disgusting because of the  graphic love scenes.  It is a good book (not her best) but a good book  worth a good read and worth the money.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash's best, maybe one of the best ever, this album is pure genius.  Its full of great songs: London Calling, Rudie Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs,  The Right Profile, Lost in the Supermarket, Clampdown, Wrong 'Em Boyo,  Death or Glory, and the list goes on. Even the ones I don't like that much  are good songs by most other bands standards.  Absolutely incredible.
B000002HEP|4.0|&quot;Sky Valley&quot; is indeed let down by its generic-metal vocalist,  but it is still a great stoner rock album.  The instrumental portions are  all well-conceived and highly atmospheric; the guitar playing is  appropriately fluid, wah-wahed and reverbed and there's even a hypnotic  acoustic number to bring you back to those long-lost tribal days of '68.   The droning riffs and rhythm section sound a lot like The Smashing Pumpkins  in their jamming moments (ie. &quot;Pistachio Medley&quot; off the  &quot;Zero&quot; EP); I'm not sure which group came first but it doesn't  matter. This kind of Hendrix/Barrett/Hawkwind influenced music doesn't grow  old, and this is a good revival of it; importantly, *atmosphere* is a  priority (and I'm not talking about dull ambient sounds, either!).  This is  the only album I have by the group, and I wanted them to go even further  with the trip (and get a new vocalist), but it's essential listening  anyway.
B0000041TD|5.0|this is an awesome recording, very romantic and emeotional it give the  cills every time i listen to it. the cast is incredible as well as the  orchestra and conductor
B00000J7J4|3.0|I used to have that song Let the children play.  That was a good song.  I  listened to it until the 45 broke one day.  I wish Mr Santana would return  to that type of music.  I do so like watching what song comes next from  him.  I think he is ok.
0785731237|5.0|When situated in the historical perspective, reading about exotic food  tastes and recipes results really astonishing. Besides, the power that the  smell and taste of the recipes gives to the love story make you feel not  only hungry but really desperate to find this special one that will make  all your senses travel that far. Laura Esquivel has the gift of exciting  every single desire from your soul and body and she actually does it with  this book.
B000002NAK|5.0|I have not listened to the soundtrack itself, but I saw the movie, which  is practically the same thing. I have to say that at first it seemed kind  of out of place (the music selection for the movie) until I realized it was  a musical (to all those Evita's fans out there: I knew nothing about the  broadway play). I have to say that I HATE musicals, with VERY few  exceptions, but this one's great! It was done the way a musical should be  done: the music narrates the story instead of interrupting it. I enjoyed  the ENTIRE movie simply because of how fun and well done the music - and  the lyrics - was. I'll soon buy this soundtrack, and to hell with all those  people who critize it simply because the broadway soundtrack's better; even  if it is, they have to admit this one's good, too. Banderas' definitely  isn't a very good singer, but he provided the funniest moments of the  movie, so I won't complain ther either. 'nuff said.
0316777722|5.0|After the somewhat somber tone of his last book, &quot;Naked&quot; I'm  glad to say David Sedaris is back with a hilarious vengeance. To pinpoint  one story over another would be unfair since they all have their individual  charm and merit, but to hear him talk about his sister Amy, (of Comedy  Central's &quot;Strangers With Candy),I almost needed a Depends  undergarment! Another treat is to hear the books on tape since he reads  most of his own material, and his voice is...unique.
0553275569|4.0|Tom Wolfe who definitely ranks as one of my favourite authors wrote this  brilliant book about the Mercury Space Program. He illustrates perfectly  how and why these seven astronauts were hailed as heroes, the setting for  the story and what made these men tick. It's also very funny and can only  really be described as Intellectual Top Gun. The one criticism I have about  the book is that Tom Wolfe could have concluded the book by telling us what  happened to these men and how the space program developped, even if he does  it in a small epilogue. Nonetheless, it's hugely entertaining. You'll enjoy  it.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Do I have the boxsets the last time they have were released? YES. Do I have them multiple times? YES. Will I buy them again? YES   WHY? Because  they are the best films in any galaxy near or far away!  Not only that,  but the EPISODE II footage...oh my. Even if it's just interviews with the  cast (which it probably will be)and not a trailer (which it won't be) it  will be well worth the money spent. Lets face it, alot of people did'nt  like the extra or the changed scenes and they felt they were best left out,  but it has no effect on the overall scheme of things so what is the  problem, let it go. It's still the same old STAR WARS they know and love,  with Mr. Lucas being the master story teller that he is, characters you  feel you've known your whole life, special effects that are still hard to  rival today and the sense that you are involved in something on a vastly  bigger scale than any, if not all other films have to offer. BUY IT, LOVE  IT, CHERISH IT, THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE<br />(p.s you know you'll  regret not buying it when it's deleted, searching all the stores and web  sites just kicking your self when you pay 3 times the price it was at  AMAZON.COM. Epecially when the prequels are finished and you want to have  that 6 movie in a row night in with your pals. FEEL DON'T THINK )
0783233477|5.0|Good literature and screenplays require that you suspend disbelief to immerse yourself into the story.  This is necessary for &quot;Meet Joe  Black.&quot;  If you can do this, then you can enjoy this movie.  The  acting is not necessarily better than other good movies; it is the total  package that rates high.  For example: (1) the supernatural element of  death taking a holiday, (2) the possibility of love-at-first-sight, and (3)  gracefully accepting the inevitability of death.  This is what this movie  depicts.  Don't expect more, because you will be disappointed (although you  will get more); I wasn't and will never be, when I view this time and  again.
B000002J0B|5.0|This album has not always had the best reviews, but then again, you are only ever comparing it to the the previous one, which, by anyones standards  was a monolithic masterpiece.  So the fact that Zeppelin have created such  a great album even in comparison to ZOSO is no mean feat, it in fact  heightens their position as rock gods.  Where many bands after creating an  album as good as ZOSO would have said &quot;where do we go from  here?&quot;, Zeppelin continued to expand their sound and enter new sonic  territory with &quot;Houses Of the Holy&quot;.  The album as a whole is  very different to what they had done before.  As a generalisation,  everything is much looser and easy going with a more electic choice of  songs.&quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; however rampages out of the  starting blocks and gets you hooked from the moment it starts, but this  song as well despite being fast and loud also has a very feel good and  joyus feel thanks to both the music and the lyrics which describe how  wherever you are &quot;the Song Remains the Same&quot;.  &quot;The Rain  song&quot; takes the whole pace of the album right down and, as a song  stands for me as one of their crowning acheivements, a beautiful melody  with an excellent crechendo at the end, almost like a dream sequence that  you wish you could live over and over again.  &quot;Over The Hills and Far  Away&quot; is another great song with a classic opening riff based on a  light, folky hook, followed by a barrage of guitars and solos which  nevertheless keep their loose and ambient feel. &quot;The Crunge&quot; has  always been a bit of a mute point as a song but you just have to accept it  for what it is, a humerous James Brown sendup rather than a serious  Zeppelin Composition.  &quot;Dancing Days&quot; is a slightly more grimy  song compared to much of the album but still feels loose compared to  Zeppelins work on earlier albums.  &quot;D'yer Maker&quot; is a very nice  reggae style song which is of coursenot a classic but nevertheless, a  comendable stab at the style. &quot;No Quarter&quot; is a strange,  atmospheric yet powerful song which creeps along without ever really  getting anywhere, totally out of place on this album, but then again, it  works perfectly.  &quot;The Ocean&quot; sums up the album in one song,  funky, loose, versatile and a sence of unpredictability.<br />Despite the  minor flaws on this album , it's hard to beleive that Zeppelin could have  released anything better after the unattainable heights of ZOSO.  They  could have easily attempted to replicate the sound and feel of it, but  instead they decided to expand their sound with overwhelmingly sucsessful  results.  The music is diverse, original and sometimes even humerous.  A  very worthwile buy.
B0000214F0|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece in that it accomplishes what it set out to do: to depict decadent, pagan Rome circa 37 AD. I cringed throughout the FIRST  VIEWING, unsure what to expect, fearing revulsion in each scene. The SECOND  VIEWING was better, I knew what to expect: a simple plot about unchecked  power with gratuitous violence and sex. Guccione may have overstated the  sex and violence but that is what you get from pagan cultures. The THIRD  VIEWING reveals the movie as art: as pornographic and dangerous as ancient  Rome at its worst with interesting props and sets. Maybe Guccione wanted to  contrast sexual cultures of ancient Rome with his magazine culture of  today: to prove that he himself and/or current exploitation of women isn't  so bad after all--only sexually explicit. Generally, sex of any kind still  has a bad reputation.  This movie only needs be a reasonably accurate  historical account (ostensibly derived from museum artifacts commonly found  around the world) to maintain historical relevance. Many will hate this  sort of reality, but not every movie has to &quot;sublimate&quot; reality  according to family movie standards to please puritanical hypocrites. Face  it: only a world as lost as Caligula's could crucify Christ.  (Notice how  persecution against the spiritually pure was greatest then?) Yes (?)  Nevertheless, this movie entertains by being so over-the-top that exquisite  sound and editing are not necessary. Again, this was the real Rome.  Finally, if you are an adult who desires full knowledge of the depth of  human depravity, then Vidal, Guccione, et al. should be praised for  accomplishing such an important (by virtue of its controversy) historical  film. I recommend this film to everyone to either love or hate. I love it!
B00000ICD9|1.0|This film is visually ambitious and sometimes spectacular, but that, in my opinion, is where the quality ends.  An apalling mawkish screenplay and an  embarassingly unctuous insipid performance by Robin Williams made me squirm  through much of this film.  He can be so phenomenal with the right  material, and this simply wasn't it.  Also wasted in this lurching mess is  the estimable Max Von Sydow.  Don't waste your time or your money on this  bomb.
B000001FY9|5.0|Bob Marley was one of the most extraordinary musicians that ever lived,  and no album could prove me right more then Legend. From &quot;No woman no  cry&quot;, to &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot; and all of my other favorites  Marley's beautiful voice is delightful to hear. This record is timeless and  no doubt loved by anyone who has heard it. Five stars, A+, two thumbs up...  Brilliant to the point where words can't describe!
B00003CWNR|4.0|Just when thoughtful adults despair that Hollywood will never again make movies for them to enjoy, Cider House Rules comes along and gives everybody  reason to hope. From its wide, opening shot to its literary ending, this  film delivers to its audience an old-fashioned, satisfying, movie-going  experience while at the same time focusing on quite a surprising topic:  abortion. Framed with Dickensian sympathy for all its characters, Cider  House weaves its way in and out of the lives of half a dozen startlingly  original people, many of them quite unusual for mainstream cinema. Michael  Caine picked up the Oscar (he's a great actor but he's become a kind of  beloved pet for middle-aged movie fans) as a drug-addicted humanitarian,  yet Delroy Lindo gives the most haunting and complex performance as the  black foreman of an apple-picking crew who loves his daughter too much.  Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron make this long film continuously  watchable and even warmly sunny despite its repeated turns into dark  material, and a gaggle of adorable moppet orphans keep tugging at the heart  strings, but not so much you feel abused. A rare modern day classic.
B0000029LG|5.0|This cd is great! It's a blast from the past to hear all of Michael's top  songs that we loved years ago. From &quot;Billie Jean&quot; to &quot;Black  or White&quot; to &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, &quot;Beat it&quot;,  &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;Little Susie&quot;.... need  I go on? These two cds and jam packed with the songs that we loved, and  still love to dance to, and sing along with. Michael Jackson has lived a  life full of troubles, and misunderstanding... but that can't take away his  extraordinary talent, or the barriers he broke in musicianship. Way to go  Michael... we hope to hear more hits from you in the future!
078324228X|4.0|The subject is tough, but the real hero of this movie is a 13-year-old kid who took the initiative to write to a man in prison he believed didn't  belong there and made the commitment to help get him out. Adults will be  just as taken with this movie. Denzel Washington gives a fine and deep  performance. Even those who already know the story of the Hurricane will be  moved. Controversy still swirls around the facts of this case, but there  can be no doubt that a man denied his rights was improperly sent to jail,  and finally, quite properly, set free.
B00000K19E|5.0|Based on the previews, I had no idea what the movie was about exactly.  It was better than I imagined and I am a sci-fi buff.<br />In a nutshell,  without ruining it for those who haven't seen it.<br />A computer programmer  who haunts the net, feels that his reality isn't quite what it seems to be.  Somehow, a strange woman becomes aware of his quest for answers.  She  puts him in contact with a mysterious man, who hints at an alternate  reality and nothing he has every dreamed of.<br />However, his choice at  revealing that alternate reality has no ability to return to the reality he  knows.  He must make a choice.  In the meantime, a group of mysterious  men, accost him at work and question what he knows of the mysterious man  and women. The inquistion gets pretty scary.<br />Needless to say Keanu Reeves  character, opts to find out what this alternative reality is.  Then it  gets really cool.<br />Maybe I missed this in many of the sci-fi movies I've  seen, but this is an angle about reality that I never imagined.  It must've  taken this generation of writers to imagine what virtual reality could do  to come up with that.  It really stretches the imagination.  Puts a new  twist on the energizer bunny.<br />I thought the special effects were great.  Mind you a bit on the violent side, but that does sell with this  generation.  I appreciate the fact that it was not gory, just mostly  destructive.<br />Keanu Reeves was perfect for this role.  He had the look and  style to pull it off.  It is nice when a person that was a young star  matures into his roles and changes with his own seasons.<br />I know some of  the guys were dissappointed that there was a love story plopped in the  middle of it, but I think that's what makes it even more interesting.<br />You  can't beat the big screen for this type of action flick.  However, I bought  the tape just to watch it every now and then for it's fabulous special  effects.  It is easy to see new things in it each time.<br />It it over the  top?  You betcha, but quite frankly, if it wasn't, it wouldn't be science  fiction.  Does it have some holes in it's theories? yup.  But, let's face  it, the Einstein's out there that tear it apart aren't writing anything  better or as interesting. Can you imagine describing to Aristotle, how a  microwave works?time.<br />It it over the  top?  You betcha, but quite frankly, if it wasn't, it wouldn't be science  fiction.

B000002UAX|5.0|It's the bloody beatles's white album, shut up and buy it. Oh, a for the  reviewer below, Matchbox 20 may sell many an album, but the quality of the  music and meaning behind it is no match for any Beatle's composition, be it  large or small. Let's see Matchbox 20 put out Help, Rubber Soul, Revolver,  Sgt. Pepper's, Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album, and Abbey Road all  within 5 years. My quarter says they can't.
B000002G7E|5.0|I'm not going to jerk off about how good this album is or try to prove  myself to any of you velvet fans out there.  All I can suggest is my  favorite way to listen to this album:  find a brutally loud stereo system,  fix your room so that it is completely dark, lie down on the floor (maybe  you haven't a choice) and turn up the stereo to as loud as you can take.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This CD is so amazing!  Her voice is so beautiful!  But since all of these  on-line reviews are about the CD, then I will begin to tell you about how  great she was in concert!  She was never boring, and her voice was even  prettier in person.  I would definitely reccomend you see her in person!
B00004T9UF|4.0|I do....Rap has always hit me as unoriginal and blatantly repetitive.  Eminem here has hit a bit of a cord with me however, me...a serious music  fan, I was as suprised as anyone. The musical styles hit me as innovative  to the genre and lyrics that are harsh and dark. Honestly, I am suprised my  many reviewers who complain that the imagery used throughout is too violent  and disturbing. Are these not the same people who go out and watch slasher  movies at the local Movie-plex? Yes, these songs are violent and very hard  to listen to at points, but there are many underlying messages and real  pain here. This is not a teen band that sings about sappy true love, this  is a man who seems to believe in true hate and pain, and makes not attempt  to cater to those who can't relate. NOT for those who cannot get into an R  rated movie, as imagery and words can be just as disturbing. Great stuff,  my only complaint is too many guest stars, I bought this album to hear  Mathers, not his pals.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|Lucasarts did a great thing with releasing the Trilogy agian. It will have the Episode II footage on it. And it will have the greatest moives of all  time included. If you have seen them once you know why you must see them  agian. And only if you have seen Episode I you must see them. For anybody  this is a great thing from people like me who are die hard Star Wars fan to  the normal every day person you have to see these moives.
B00002E23V|1.0|This movie is not one you will want to see.  You can see it because you want to see how stupid it is, but not because you want to be satisfied.   The effects are horrible.  When the shark eats Samuel L Jackson, it is the  fakest thing i have ever seen, period.  LL Cool J lights a lighter, and  throws it, when he throws it the flame doesnt go out, and it hits the WATER  and explodes in a huge explosion? WTF?  The sharks look very fake, and  you will be wondering why the people are so stupid.  When the sharks eat  the people it is cool, but very fake and anticlimatic
B00004WEJZ|5.0|When Kevin McClory teamed up with the Eon company to make the movie Thunderball in 1965 he was contractually obliged not to exercise his rights  to the James Bond character for ten years, Sure enough in 1975 McClory  started  pitching a 007 script titled Warhead to all the competing studios,  but it wasn't until 1983 that Never Say Never Again actually made it to the  silver screen opening opposite the lame Roger Moore vehicle Octopussy.  Never Say Never Again (a title suggested by Sean Connery's wife) has on  display a variation of the plot that McClory had produced almost 20 years  earlier.<br />Faced with not being able to include the iconic familiar gun-barrel sequence at the beginning of their 1983 Bond movie, Taliafilm (named after the wife of the producer and Rocky actress Talia Shire) had to cone up with their own graphic image.  What they decided upon gives the first clue that we are about to experience something different, a breath of fresh air and a good kick up the rear end to a series of movies that had become stale through resorting to self-parody and recycled dialogue and villainy.<br />Yes, [NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a retelling of the THUNDERBALL storylines worked out between Fleming, Bryce, Whittingham and McClory. It's technically speaking not a remake of the 1954 picture though, but a different version of the story using characters that appeared in the earlier drafts (such as Fatima Blush).<br />And from the moment the screen fills up with all those 007's and the audience is drawn in, we know right away that Connery is back and  better than ever, and looking much fitter than he did in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.<br />The title song has been attacked by 007 fans over the years, but I actually like it quite a lot (in direct comparison with the rest of the admittedly rather tame soundtrack). I have found myself over the past 20 years humming it to myself (sometimes at the most inopportune moments) and so it has obviously become seared into my consciousness as only a catchy tune can.<br />And here we come to what is the 1983 movie's pretitle sequence. But instead of interrupting the flow of the story with yet more images of nude women and silly fluorescent effects the titles play out for the action allowing the audience to immediately find its feet and settle into the pace of this thrilling picture.<br /> Of course it's not the first time that we have seen Bond killed off in the opening minutes. We saw it first at the hands of Red Grant in 1963's FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and then again just four years later in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. Here Bond is on a training mission and for those with keen eyes its really quite obvious (no muzzle fore from 007's gun). As such it works a little better in the little details, and when 007 rescues the leggy millionaires daughter held captive she plunges a knife into him.<br />It is at this point that the factor of a new M really pays off. We see Edward Fox sternly watching the exercise on tape. We see another unidentified character (presumably Tanner). Its not until the very last minute that Connery's 007 is revealed - alive and well.<br />Following on from a dressing down from M is one of my favorite sequences in the movie - namely Shrublands. It's a favorite of mine because we really get introduced to my favorite character in the movie Fatima Blush. The 1965 movie has Fiona Volpe, but Volpe lacked the super-charged charisma, biting wit and ego-maniacal psychotic nature that Barbara Carrera simply oozes as Blush.<br />Look at the tenderness she shows to Jack, followed immediately by her bashing his head against the wall. Witness her dispatching of Jack and then crooning over her pet snake, and who can forget her final confrontation with 007 - \\"guess where you get the first one.\\"<br />Carrera steals every scene she is in. She dances on her way to kill Bonds French ally and like a black widow spider she seduces 007 and then attempts to kill him with a device to attract a special group of sharks attached to his air tanks.<br />The second highlight is the appearance of Indiana Jones alum Pat Roach as Count Lippe. Who cannot appreciate and revel in the fun fight in which Roach's Lippe plays the indestructible Jaws role, minus the embarrassing buffoonery that Richard Kiel brought to the EON franchise.  Bond throws everything at Lippe to no avail and then in an amusing conclusion the character is blinded by Bond's urine falling back into a collection of glass cylinders and test tubes.<br />Connery's reaction is classic.<br />In an attempt perhaps to counter the familiarity of the group of has-been actors inhabiting the SIS offices in the EON series at the time, this Connery movie has the most impressive list of actors to inhabit any Bond movie. In addition to the already mentioned Connery, Fox, Carrera and Roach we also have the incredible Klaus Maria Brandeur as Largo, the revered Max Von Sydow and Bernie Casey as a black Felix Leiter (hey, why not?!).<br />Brandeur plays Largo with just the right amount of understated menace and Casey is probably the second best Leiter of the series (after Hedison). You really get the feeling that he and Connery's 007 are the best of buddies, their interactions and playful barbs appear genuinely affectionate and respectful of the other,<br />The one A-list actor who really lets down the rest of the team is Kim Basinger. She admittedly didn't have much to go on, but it is in this one respect that Claudine Auger and the 1965 EON effort takes the honors.<br />Some have said that it is with Bonds arrival in Nassau, that this movie tends to wander a little. I respectfully disagree. It is here that the majority of Carrera's scenes appear and here that Connery has his first confrontation with Largo. I have yet to really understand the computer game the two play, but it works nicely in building up some real tension and suspense (name a Moore 007 -villain scene that achieved the same level of pent up pressure - I can't). The final line from Connery - \\" I wouldn't know, I've never lost\\" is also probably one of the best 007 comebacks in the entire series.<br />Yes, this section of the movie also features some of the best dialogue, the promise of which had been ably shown in the brilliant Q-scene earlier in the picture. The lines come thick and fast and are genuinely witty in comparison with some of the gags in the Moore series of pictures. In addition Rowan Atkinson nicely doesn't outstay his welcome as comic relief and his \\"don't know his mother\\" line always makes me smile.  Other gags that work include the cigarette lighter gag at the casino and the \\"your place or mine\\" bomb at the hotel.<br />The ending in Africa is over a little too soon and the small battle in the underground caverns lacks the scope of some of the 007 pictures. But I think it works well in the context of the rest of the picture and is not the confusing, overlong mess that really mars the 1965 effort. Its cleaner and tighter, just the way I like it.<br />Yes, even though Roger Moore is my favorite 007 actor,  \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is my favorite 007 picture.<br />Irvin Kershner, who directed the best of the Star Wars movies, again brings us a franchises crowning achievement with a steady directing hand, incredible witty dialogue, superb performances by an amazing cast and Sean Connery returning revitalized after a 12 year absence from the role that made him famous.<br />It's the one 007 movie that I have watched more than any other.<br />After the movie was obtained by MGM-UA (the  company that produces the EON production) there was talk among fans as to  the possibility of the gun barrel sequence being added to make it part of  the \\"canon\\", I for one do not think that this unique James Bond 007 movie  should be tampered with in that manner and equally happy to see it emerge  on DVD.

068484267X|5.0|AA had me mesmerized from the moment I began reading it.  Mr. McCourt has  such a simple, straight forward, yet incredibly descriptive way of telling  his story.

It was truly amazing that  this story (coupled with &quot;'Tis&quot;...which I HIGHLY recommend!) is  the tale of only ONE person!
B000002UJQ|5.0|When Radiohead first broke the mainstream with Pablo Honey, it was realized that rock couldn't get much more intelligent. The five piece  proved that you don't need to be incredibly dumb to rock, nor be ordinary.  They were strange and obscure to say the least, and angst was plentiful  inside their odd, melodic three guitar attack. Well one album passed, and  they released the record that made everyone pay attention. OK Computer was  really their breakthrough, carrying the hit singles Paranoid Android and  Karma Police. Thom Yorke was as sad as ever while writing this, you can  tell, because a lot of the songs have a structure that could easily be set  to tears and death. Some of the songs are almost Eels-esque, while others  are deep and beautiful, winding tales of distress and confusion in the not  so futuristic world. Many people will describe their favorite band as  talented, but if you compare them to Radiohead, their band has no chance.  Radiohead can pen their own songs so easily and wonderfully, it's amazing  people do hate them. Yes, there is a reason that OK Computer is at number  352 and has a five star rating on Amazon over three years after its  release. This is definitely something no one should be left without. It is  a vivid illustration of futuristic chaos, not only out in the world, but in  one's mind as well. There are your acoustic ballads (Exit Music (For A  Film)), your swanky Britpop tunes (Paranoid Android, Karma Police), and  your alternative epic (Airbag), and those are just my favorites. If you are  a pop fan looking for something new and incredible, and an alternative to  all of the horribly untalented musicians on MTV and such, buy this record.  Heck, everyone should buy this record. It is something you have to do. Buy  The Bends after that, also wonderful.
6305078564|4.0|Jane Austen's satirical view on life, love, and society is ageless, and this production of her most famous work has captured that well. The humour in the situations arising, and the folly of the characters is rendered so entirely believeable by an exceptional cast, Miss Austen herself could have no complaints.<BR>Colin Firth pulls off a creditable Fitzwilliam Darcy, and Jennifer Ehles brings Elizabeth Bennet to life, but the prizes have to go to David Bamber and Alison Steadman, portraying respectively, the most sycophantic Mr Collins, and the most inane Mrs Bennet one can imagine. Rest assured you will love to hate both of them.<BR>I do however caution anyone using a DVD-ROM rather than a set-top player to view their DVD's that this encoding is not the best. Instead of encoding from the original film it was taken from video tapes, with reversed fields, making movement, when viewed at the higher refresh and resolution of a PC monitor, to cause tearing across colour borders. I own the DVD's and love them, but I have to set up my DVD playing software to counteract this problem each time.

B00004XMS0|3.0|This series as a whole deserves an average grade becuase it starts out wonderfully with a great director (Tim Burton) and ends with Joel Shumacher  sucking the life out of it. The first two films have themes and actual  characters. The last two films are empty, but they have a ton of explosives  and high-profile actors hamming it up for no good reason. If possible, try  to find a set with just Batman and Batman Returns. Then you get your  money's worth.
6302800420|5.0|Tootsie is one of those movies you watch and see something new in every time. If you saw this once in the 80's and went away thinking it was a  sharp farce from a major studio, you were right -- but it has a bunch of  other sides going for it too.<br />It is a great comedy. This movie has  perfect timing -- just that rhythm that makes you laugh. I won't  overanalyze. But man, it works. Scene after scene just works. You never hit  a false note.<br />What movie ever kick started more character actors'  careers? Dabney Coleman made hay for about a decade in spinoffs of his  creepy director. Geena Davis had just a few lines, but her career really  only started when Dorothy Michaels gave her some &quot;tips&quot; in the  dressing room. Doctor Brewster is a blustery, flustered riot; he got some  TV roles from this movie. Jessica Lange got an Oscar -- maybe the only one  for this movie, which was a travesty. Sidney Pollack, playing Michael  Dorsey's agent while he directed, gets some amazing laughs. And when you  watch the movie, you'll see a bunch more little gems of performances. The  producer of the soap is great. And what about Bill Murray? I almost forgot  him. Somebody really cast this movie incredibly well. Oh, and Charles  Durning. Oh, and Teri Garr is perfect. And... and...<br />Amazon maybe isn't  the place to pick apart a bunch of serious themes, but Tootsie also packs  some ideological bang. The whole premise is that Dustin Hoffman's actor is  a self centered perfectionist, and that he figures a lot of things out  (about women, about himself) while he's wearing his wig to make a buck.  You're going to laugh when Michael's desperate to do the Eleanor Roosevelt  story, sure, but there's something there, too. If there's another, better  movie about the relationship between the sexes I haven't seen it.<br />Cutting  it short: Tootsie is the only romantic comedy I can think of that really  deserved a Best Picture award. It doesn't get remembered much, but it's a  five star movie without a doubt, and it really deserves more recognition.ve star movie without a doubt, and it really deserves more recognition.
1558908358|5.0|Tron was a movie that was utterly unappreciated in its time, yet this film laid the groundwork for computer integration into filmmaking; for this  reason alone, it should be seen so that modern films are appreciated even  more - and to show that a decent plot should accompany all eye  candy.<BR><BR>This film is also excellent for those of us who grew up in  the 1980's and want another breath of our childhoods. This film exemplifies  the 80's, from the arcade to the dress to the way in which computers were  viewed with an almost religious awe by the uninitiated. The film really  captures the mystique of computers before they were brought to the masses  as well as all the myriad social feelings about technology during the 80's,  both the hope and the fear.<BR><BR> Do yourself a favor and go get this  film. You won't be sorry.
B000005L86|5.0|The subject matter contained in the lyrics alone is spellbinding.  The  production stands on it's own merits, and needs no comparison.  The vocals  border on the very spooky, hairs on your neck spooky.  Combine all these  and, well what can I say, an album from beyond space and time.  How can  human beings create such beauty without direct divine influence?<br />This  album defies criticism, cheats logic, and as the sleeve notes say,  &quot;transcends the category of music&quot;.<br />Beautiful yet Deadly  Serious...  Consider yourself lucky if you can hear this, Perry's  masterpiece.
B000003S0R|5.0|Brian Eno had finally broken away from Roxy Music and was ready to take on  a solo career.  Although his brilliance was seen on many Roxy Music albums  I do not believe anyone in 1973 could have predicted such an influential  and poignant solo career as Brian Eno has had thus far.  From his important  and trend starting collaborations with Robert Fripp, David Bowie and David  Byrne, to his pioneering of ambient music as we know it.  Everything Brian  Eno has done is incredible.  No one figured he would make such a huge  impact, but he did.  One thing that very few musicians do these days is  think through their music and actually dig deep into their music to  discover the true essence of their existence and why they are making the  music they are.  Most musicians now make their music without any thought or  meaning.  Which is a pity because of the success Brian Eno has had using  the technique I just mentioned. Probably the biggest surprise of  &quot;Taking tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot; is the fact that the album  does not have one instrumental included on it.  Brian Eno, the one that  persuaded to David Bowie to move away from pop/rock and into a very  ambient-like musical environment with sides 2 of &quot;Low&quot; and  &quot;Heroes,&quot; in 1974 comes out with an instrumental-free album.   This is not bad at all.  Eno, at the very least, has very strong and  beautiful voice that fills the listeners' ears very magically.  The  starting track, 'Burning Airlines Give You So Much More,' is such a strong  and majestic track.  Nothing in words can express the how well Eno sings  and performs on this song.  You got to hear it to believe it!  'Back In  Judy's Jungle,' at first listen might seem to be an instrumental, but as  with most tracks on this album, Eno bursts out his vocals after about a  minute to a minute and a half of instrumentation.  'The Fat Lady of  Limbourg' again tricks the listener.  The first time I listened to this  song, I though for sure it was going to be an instrumental.  The name of  the song, alone, I though gave it away.  But, again, Eno surprised me with  lyrics for the song.  'Mother Whale Eyeless' doesn't seem to be such a good  song, but once you listen to it more and more, the listener realizes just  how awesome this song really is, and how much means to the line up of the  album.  And what can be said about the song 'The Great Pretender.'  This  song sweeps you away to a world where pretending is rewarded and life is a  puzzle.  The song 'Third Uncle' is a song that is much unlike any other  song on the album.  'Third Uncle' seems to be much more techno oriented,  whereas the other tracks on &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot;  are more ambient oriented than anything else.  'Put A Straw Under Baby' is  much like a baby lullaby.  It's sweet and soothing tune, along with Eno's  quiet yet peaceful lyrics make for a song that would make the most awake  baby fall instantly asleep.  'The True Wheel' is one of the most strongest  tracks on the CD.  I believe it is a very powerful and probably sums up the  whole mood of the album in one title.  'China My China,' much like its  counterpart, 'Burning Airlines Give You So Much More,' and altogether a  very comfortable and enjoyable song.  The final track, which happens to be  the title track, is a great song, and again I figured to be an  instrumental.  But again I was wrong.
B00000JY1X|3.0|If ever an album came with the unspoken sub-text &quot;Look at me, I'm a  genius&quot;, it is this one.  Stephin Merritt's soi-disant magnum opus  consists of a set of 69 (to that extent it does  exactly what it says on  the tin...) songs - using the term rather loosely in some cases -   exploring all aspects of love with the aid of a fair proportion of the  musical styles known  to man, and a somewhat puerile pun...<br />Unfortunately  the whole concept seems to have a couple of serious drawbacks:<br />Firstly,  in covering of such a disparate set of musical styles - whether as an  attempt to  be all things to all men, or just to prove that he could it -  Merritt deprives the album  of any stylistic focus, and renders it  musically - if not thematically - somewhat incoherent:  a certain amount of  variety is one thing, but there is such a thing as overdoing it and this  wide diversity is a double-edged sword, increasing the likelihood of any  individual  listener finding both &quot;good&quot; AND &quot;bad&quot; in  the songs.<br />Secondly, Merritt seems to have been too wedded to the  necessity of having the &quot;correct&quot;  number of songs to be able to  bring any sense of objectivity to bear on the material, with  the result  that some of the songs amount to little more than throw-away fragments  which  scarcely deserve to be accorded the term &quot;song&quot;.<br />Having  said all that, the album does have things going for it: the lyrics are  generally intelligent and worth the space allocated to printing them in the  liner notes (would that this were the case with EVERY album...!), Merritt's  rather lugubrious voice is effective when you get used to it, and - above  all - there ARE some excellent songs in here...<br />Ultimately this album can  be compared to a diamond mine. There are gems in there - and some fairly  high-quality ones at that - but you have to be prepared to sift through a  fair amount of muck to find them. Given that you're prepared todo that,  this one might well be worth buying...
0790749858|2.0|Attention!   My rating is not intended for the film itself but for Warner Brother's decision not to give us a widescreen or letterboxed format of  this movie.  Anyone who has been holding out for a special edition of this  film will only be half pleased when they realize the film is still shown in  the pan and scan format.  I understand this film is aimed at children and  that they might not like it letterboxed but you could at least give us the  choice like Columbia Tristar did when they released Stuart Little (both a  pan and scan and a widescreen version were made available on DVD for this  film).  Come on WB!   Get with the program!
B00003CWTH|3.0|If you want to see a long movie handling a variety of overlapping stories, with similar themes, and an equally impressive ensemble cast, but *without*  the obnoxious camerawork, tiresome on-screen philosopizing, and intrusive  moments of unforgivable stupidity, then see Short Cuts by director Robert  Altman. That is very much how Magnolia struck me in the end -- a hipper,  more wildly indulgent Short Cuts, with less of a sense of humor and a much  greater thirst for grit and overdone metaphysical distress.<br />If I had only  seen tape 1 of the 2-tape film, I probably would've walked away intending  to recommend it to friends. The cast of characters struck me as  fundamentally fascinating. The performances were high-to-very-high-quality.  The dramatic tension of the interlaced stories was tangible and gripping.  Sure, it was all a bit self-indulged and generally unpleasant, but this  could've been, based on just tape 1, overlooked in favor of the movies  better elements. At the hour-and-a-half or maybe two-hour mark, I felt this  movie had a lot going for it.<br />But the movie takes a severe nosedive when  the entire cast of characters decides to take &quot;time out&quot; from the  movie in order to all sing along to Aimee Mann's hit single. What the F#$%  was that? I couldn't believe my eyes or ears. 100% unnecessary, and  utterly, unforgivably stupid -- irresponsible film-making at its very  worst. Did Mr. Anderson run out of ideas of how to interconnect things? Is  that the best he could do? &quot;We'll have them all put their lives on  hold and suspend reality entirely in order to pay tribute to the bad folk  song that is used to shamelessly promote this would-be art movie.&quot;  Wow. So bad! I could've done without P.Seymour Hoffman's &quot;This is the  scene where...&quot; talk on the phone, if you recall that, (way too  blatant), but for me, the &quot;song&quot; scene really was the beginning  of the end, because things just get worse and worse from there.<br />Problem 1  with the last hour of this film: nothing comes together. The threads only  interweave minimally, and disappointingly, and certainly not as cleverly as  all of the foreshadowing of the first half of the film would lead you to  expect. The beginning of Magnolia, and the way it initially developed  itself, led me to believe that things were building to an impressive chain  of simultaneous &quot;coincidences,&quot; a cacaphony of harmonious changes  or some such. It SEEMED to build towards this -- the middle HOUR of the  movie is non-stop tension, with important aspects of all the characters  hanging in the balance. And then what happens? Nothing. Things lull for a  bit and everyone sings a bad folk song at the same time. From there on Mr.  Anderson chooses to substitute &quot;weird&quot; for coherence and genuine  dramatic import. <br />Don't get me wrong. I kind of like the frogs. It's bold  and memorable. But that's all it is. It completely throws the context of  reality in which the film was heretofore functioning. You could say  &quot;that's kind of the point,&quot; and the intrusive narration (who in  god's name IS the narrator, anyhow?) would certainly like you to think  that. But that's just too easy a rationalization. Given the *point* in the  movie at which the frogs make their arrival, it just feels like an excuse  for the writer/directors inability to pull things together (and get his  &quot;message&quot; across) in a more skillful and satisfying way. It was  fun to see but it gives me no further insight into any of the characters. A  bold and imaginative move -- but an arbitrary and unhelpful one, also.  <br />That's another complaint. For as fundamentally fascinating as the  cabinet of characters were, they change remarkably little during the course  of the film. And the ways in which they do change are either trite, or  generally unclear. Take Tom Cruise's character, as a single example: we  find out important aspects of Frank Mackey's past, but never find out what  it really has to do with his current personality. We see him break down in  the presence of his dying father but are left to merely wonder whether or  not this marks any real change for him. He seems to have changed somewhat  by the end of the film but we never quite understand the why or how of it;  I'm not sure P.T. Anderson did either. If he did, he didn't portray it  effectively. Most of the other characters just sort of either ...  &quot;learn their lesson&quot; ... or are left hanging in ambiguity. (Has  J. Moore changed or learned anything? Has the Jimmy Baker character?) The  characters were fascinating but Mr. Anderson seemed to lack the proficiency  to explore them with any particular depth. The film's outward style  attempts to convey the illusion of &quot;depth&quot; (through a lot of  crying and depressing revelations) but when one looks carefully there is  little to support this &quot;atmosphere&quot; of profundity. <br />To  conclude: Magnolia is a long-winded and disappointing film. It had a lot  going for it and if nothing else, was certainly interesting. It's something  to see if you're curious to see it. But I just think it fell far short of  its full potential, taking too many easy-outs and leaving too much in the  air. The narratorial &quot;philosophizing&quot; was cheap and intrusive,  the characters left in a surprisingly underdeveloped haze, the dramatic  tension ultimately tossed aside in favor of thematically trite weirdness,  and the soundtrack repulsively employed.
B00000K19E|1.0|Maybe I've seen just one too many movies recently with the &quot;you just *think* it's reality&quot; premise (Dark City seems to be a common  reference point for reviews of this film) or maybe it's that the  &quot;intelligent machines represent the next rung on the evolutionary  ladder&quot; concept has sooo been done in SF literature.   Maybe it was  the too-often pointless use of the way cool effects, maybe it was the  extra-cliched ending - I'm not sure. But I think The Matrix is extremly  over-rated and simply bloated with self-importance.<br /> The story centers  around Thomas Anderson, a.k.a. super-hacker Neo, who's rapidly sucked out  of his workaday life at Very Big Software Corporation right through the  looking glass into the waiting arms of Morpheus and the rest of the crew of  his strangely retro cyber submarine.   Seems ol' Morph is convinced Neo is  The One, as in the one who will save humanity. From.....OK, well.   Seems  that the world Neo thinks is 1999 (they can't fool me, it has 1998 written  all over it) is really just a construct of super powerful AIs who are  interested in humanity only for the bioenergy it creates - The *real* real  world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland where only a ragtag band of human  survivors is left to carry on the fight against this unspeakable evil.   Quick, stop me before I cliché again!   Oh, and their capital city  is...&quot;Zion&quot;, one of many annoyingly heavy-handed pseudo-symbolic  references in the film.<br />Suffice it to say that,                      like  the Japanese manga and Hong Kong movies that form its closest counterparts,  it's told                      pretty much through pictures and poses (for  instance, the Wachowskis hired                       &quot;wire-fighting&quot; expert Woo-ping Yuen to teach their cast those  insanely high kicking kung                      fu moves). It also tries to  create an atmosphere of                      extreme paranoia based on the  Buddhist fear that theworld around us is nothing more than                       &quot;illusion&quot;, distracting us from scary truths. The fact is,  the Matrix is the kind of film which either appeals to you or does not, and  you'll know within five minutes whether to leave the theatre. For those  love movies with paper-thin characterisation and an excess of undisciplined  imagination it will be seen as a &quot;great film&quot;. The impact this  film has speaks volumes about the times we live in - Man, it almost makes  me dread the sequel.
B00002NDB1|4.0|this album is actually a very solid album containing the iron maiden feel.  the new album , even though i fit is very good, has no iron maiden feel to  it all. this album still has the sonic maiden sound, catchy time changes  and technical riffs. the new album is a bit glossy(made for the radio),  lacks some energy, doesnt use many creative technical riffs(almosst all  power chords)and worst of all has modermn rock elements( just listen to the  chorus of the wickerman or the thin line between love and hate) im not  saying that its a bad album(i think its great) but it is the modern iron  maiden(bruce without long hair and with baggy gap trousers?) virtual xi  however still has an 80's metal feel to it. i reccomend both albums to all  maiden fans. UP THE IRONS!!
B00004U45G|1.0|here we are again, same old songs , tired old lyrics , the year is 2000  not 1971
6305905401|1.0|I was very excited to finally get to see this film, as I had missed it's theatrical release.  I have always considered Polanski of of the best  directors around, but this movie is a big waste of the viewer's time.  Well  paced and clever camera work stand out only to be overshadowed by a  ridiculous plot. The ending aside, a BIG let down.   <br />Depp never ceases  to amaze me as he is always quite good.  An underrated actor for sure.   Frank Langella's performance however is ridiculous,when you DO see him on  screen. A lot of his dialogue is presented &quot;over the phone&quot;.  A  trick student filmmakers often use to save money.  Perhaps Polanski didn't  like him either.   He should have lit himself on fire in the opening  sequence instead, and spared us his worthless characature of a truly evil  man.  <br />The classic &quot;Rosebary's Baby&quot; still holds up today, and  even looks good on TV late at nite despite commercials!  Buy that instead.
B00004XMS0|3.0|I can personally say that I am a big fan of Batman and Batman Returns.  I find these two Tim Burton films as wonderful pieces of pop cinema.  In,  Batman it doesnt go for camp and trys to take the Batman legend seriously.  Batman Returns goes even further, and explores the characters of Catwoman  and Batman.  It's hard to find that in commercial film.  As for Batman  Forever, it rates a C+.  There's plenty of eye candy, but not much else.   It is however a good popcorn muncher.  Batman &amp; Robin is pretty bad,  but not as bad as some people think.  I do wish it was on Mystery Science  Theatre, though. This box set doesn't contain any new extras. All it is is  the ones released a few years ago with just production notes.  Buy the  first two seperatly, but if you're patient just remember there will  probably be special edition versions in a few years.
0780622545|4.0|&quot;Dark City&quot; is definitely a film noir.  All aspects of this movie are dark and shady, everything from the characters and the settings  down to the plot.<br />The hero, Murdoc becomes aware that all is not as it  seems and we follow his quest to unravel the truth.  He has to question  everything he's ever known; from friends and family down to the basic laws  of physics.<br />For the most part, I disagree with the editorial review.   This is not a study in human nature like &quot;The Shawshank  Redemption&quot; or &quot;Amadeus&quot; to be sure.  There are great sets  and good cinematography coupled with a compelling storyline.  The  characters are not particularly &quot;well developed&quot; but I wouldn't  call them one dimentional, either.  The movie is a psychological thriller -  about what happens in one's mind, and to this end it's not necessary to  develop deep characters, the plot is what's being showcased and it does a  great job at that.  <br />Murdoc is everyman.  If you're one who has thought  that there must be more to the game than what's presented, on *any* level  you'll enjoy this movie.
B00003CXGG|2.0|You know this is going to be bad when Jet Li is only in it 50% of the time and the acting is left to Aaliyah.<br />The story involves 2 powerful San  Francisco families who are gobbling (at times by force) up properties in  the waterfront area so they can sell it to a NFL expansion team who wants  to build their stadium there.  However, when the sons of each family are  mysteriously murder, it starts a war between the two housholds.<br />Jet Li  and Aaliyah play the siblings trying to figure out what happened.  Jet Li  is very wooden in his role here and feels very uncomfortable playing a  so-called love interest to Aaliyah.  He doesn't show the charisma that he  does in his Hong Kong Movies. The first time acting Aaliyah is charismatic,  but she (and Jet too) show no chemistry and her acting abilities are pretty  poor.  There are a few fight scenes, but they are mostly people who can't  fight, getting beaten up by Li.<br />The special effects (done by those who  did THE MATRIX) are poor as well.  You can easily tell everyone are on  wires and they don't hide this fact.  This leads to everything looking  really fake.<br />The directing for Bartkowiak is also poor.  He cuts too much  and does not know what to do with Jet Li's quick movements.  Often times  there is confusion in his directing during fight scenes.  He should have  just stepped back and given the actors a wide lens to show the kung-fu  action in all it's glory (and without wires).<br />The DVD has many features,  including two behind the scenes (one for the movie, one for a music video),  4 featurettes on the Special Effects and production notes.  However, this  all seemed like a waste of time for me since the movie was so  uninteresting.  The DVD picture is clean but not spectacular, fairly  average for a DVD.<br />The sound is poor.  The hip-hop sountrack and the  action is too loud and the dialog is too quiet.  This poor balance made me  adjust the volume at least 10 times throughout the movie.<br />Rating: C-
B000007OY0|5.0|I am normally loathe to give *anything* a perfect score.  Perfect scores are just that: perfection.  I feel that this movie is indeed perfect.  Deep  characters, an excellent storyline, believable situations, you name  it.<br />The hero, Andy receives a life sentence for the murder of his wife,  and then spends the next 20+ years living it out.  After quite some time,  Andy manages to make friends with a few of the inmates and after being  placed in a pivotal position, begins to make real improvements in the  prison rehabilitation practices.<br />The movie draws you in and holds you  there.  There are very, very few movies on the planet that can achieve that  all-elusive place of causing you to forget that you're in the real  world.<br />Set aside plenty of time to watch this masterpiece so you can  enjoy it uninterrupted and prepare to stand in awe of filmmaking as an art.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is one of those rare movies that tend to make a world love it.  This movie is a comedy first off, but a dark one at that.  You can  watch it and realize what a great movie this has become.  Upon viewing the  trailer to the movie, I thought it would be just a sexy raunchy film with  just some special effect (the flower petals) and a bland storyline.   However, upon viewing the actual movie, I was shocked and blown away at  just how good this movie is.  An cast that really brings the movie to life  and a plot that will have some thinking and others offended.  The movie is  more than just what most think, it's really about the hidden beauty within  the world, within ourselves and within our minds.  But don't let that fool  you, the movie is funny all the same, but smart funny, not fart fart funny.   Probably the best feature about the movie is Kevin Spacey and his role as  a man simply wanting the younger beauty the world has to offer, but this  has gotten many offended, but it's very interesting as to how he deals with  it, it's also hilarious.  Keeping the ending a secret, you'll suprised what  is to come of this tale.  Buy it, I can almost promise you that you'll love  it.

B000002H97|5.0|Metallica's self entitled CD is the best CD they have come out with.  The  songs like &quot;Entersandman&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven&quot; just make  you want to turn your stereo up full blast.  I think this CD is better than  'Master of Puppets'.  If your a Metallica fan and you don't have this CD, I  urge you to go out and get it, your Metallica collection will not even be  closed to complete without this CD.  This CD ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0004723724|5.0|If you like wit, look no further.  Oscars outlook on life is somewhat  differnt to what most people would consider normal.  However his works are  all very readable and fun.  A great book for anyone who loves reading and  who hasn't read any Oscar Wilde.
6304789300|5.0|This film is one of the best that I have seen in a long, long time.  It is extremely suspensful and has surprisingly interesting characters,  especially Anthony Hopkins.  You see both the best and worst in humans, and  although Hopkins' character is not perfect, it does give you a touching  example of man at his best.  While I am not sure I would sit down to read a  first-aide manual when someone is injured (do you try to save the guy and  perhaps kill him through ignorance, or do you take a few minutes to read  the manual, hoping to find out what to do?), Hopkins' character does show a  quiet dignity and character that most people today don't even TRY to aspire  to.  The end is his &quot;finest moment&quot; and it would be lovely if we  could all show the dignity that he did, in not humiliating his cheating  wife and her lover.  To let them off the hook with their public faces in  tact shows a great deal of integrity, and perhaps is even more humiliating  for the wife when she realizes that not only has she behaved very badly  towards him, but that he knows it and can still behave better than she  can!<br />A really excellent movie!
B000000WCV|5.0|Daft Punk reaches all limits in the computerized techno music genre. This  album packs both high voltage techno tunes and in your face fast-paced  beats that keep you wanting more! I can't express how happy I was to  stumble upon this techno-titan's album. To hear his music on surround  theaters can intensify the experience and give you all around better sound  quality, but even on a regular Sony Discman the sound blows you away. Daft  Punk is one of my favorite techno artists and can now be classified as  unsurmountable when it comes to mixing together a techno package for the  ages.
B00004W5UA|5.0|Had I paid attention to the lukewarm critical reviews this movie received upon its relaease, I would have passed it by in the video store, and that  would have been a mistake.  This is a brilliantly conceived, written and  acted examination of the age-old philosphical question: what is the meaning  of life?  &quot;Fight Club&quot; attempts to answer this question about  modern life, which the film views as a vicious cycle of consumerism and  dissatisfaction, and then you die.  This movie is a lot more than a series  of punch-ups among testosterone-driven Neanderthals; it stayed with me for  days.  I believe it will make you think, and that's a good thing!
0446525537|5.0|This was a wonderful story about how some people can change our lives.  I for one know the importance of intense yet, odd relationships such as the  one that Landon and the preachers daughter had.  The popular guy afraid for  losing his &quot;position&quot; in the school.  And the quiet and shy  preachers daughter who is so sweet and off limits to any and everyone.  Read this story!  It is wonderful that is all I have to say.

6304493738|5.0|Typical of all really good films, it has a twist in the tail that a great white shark would be proud of. Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne are two of  the best character actors in the business and Usual Suspects is some of  their best work. Those films which leave you with the hairs on the back of  your neck tingling when you leave the theatre are few and far between, and  this is definetly one of them.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I risk putting off many long-time Iron Maiden fans by the following:  The  first Iron Maiden album I bought was Virtual XI, and it's still on of my  favorites, #2 behind Somewhere in Time.  Coming into the band this late I  believe gives me a somewhat unique perspective on the band.  Cries of  &quot;The return of Iron Maiden&quot; and &quot;The Beast is finally  back&quot; don't mean the same thing to me.  Also, upon first listening to  this album, it does not recall me to the earlier albums it has been  compared to.  Musically I find it more similar to the albums done with  Blaze Bayley, especially the tracks &quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot; and  &quot;The Mercenary&quot;.  Try the karaoke function on your stereo, you  might be surprised.  Although Bayley's vocal range may have been a bit  limited for the songs of Iron Maiden, they were still good songs.  I'm glad  that the work and style used on the last few albums was not scrapped  altogether, in fact I would be a bit dissapointed if I didn't hear any of  that material in their live show.  One difference I do find with a Brave  New World is that after each listen I find myself wanting to hear it again  and again.  With older albums On listen usually satisfies me for awhile,  but this album grows on you fast.  It's already rose to the top of my Iron  Maiden list, even over Somewhare in time, mostly due to my favorite tracks,  &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot; and &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;.   This is an album for all Iron Maiden fans, new and old.
0140149295|5.0|The Sixteenth Round was the powerful, emotional document of Rubin Carter's  life, ending with a plead to force a new trial to prove his innocence.   But, it turned out to be a timeless, eye-opening portrait of prisons in  America and the haunting truth of Justice and Fate.<br />Needless to say, this  book is explicit, angry, and takes all prisoners. You can't escape the  cruelty of Rubin's life, witnessing the reality, and how he was caught in  the center of Hell...and the haunting fact was that it was the truth.  The  pain he had to go through is, to me, inconceivable.  <br />Rubin Carter has  written a terrific book, more than what he wanted it to be...a timeless  testament about America, justice, prison, and fate...He may not be the best  boxer, but he is one of the best fighters...fighting the dehumanization of  his life weaving through prison and out, and fighting the cruelty of  &quot;Madame One-Eyed Justice&quot; and &quot;Fate.&quot;<br />This book will  not come off of your brain...it is a very honest, angry, stirringly  emotional, thriller of a book.  I recommend it to the people who saw the  movie, and someone who wants a direct and eye-opening portal into the mind  of a black man living through the Civil Rights Movement.

The  pain he had to go through is, to me, inconceivable.  <br />Rubin Carter has  written a terrific book, more than what he wanted it to be...a timeless  testament about America, justice, prison, and fate...He may not be the best  boxer, but he is one of the best fighters...fighting the dehumanization of  his life weaving through prison and out, and fighting the cruelty of  &quot;Madame One-Eyed Justice&quot; and &quot;Fate.&quot;<br />This book will  not come off of your brain...it is a very honest, angry, stirringly  emotional, thriller of a book.  I recommend it to the people who saw the  movie, and someone who wants a direct and eye-opening portal into the mind  of a black man living through the Civil Rights Movement.
B000002HPV|5.0|As a person who really likes dark, experimental, scary, depressing music,  and I was just introduced to Bjork by a relative, I figured I would by  Homogenic.<br />This 10-song CD is filled with a brutal pain of heartbreak,  loneliness, anger, and tragedy.  Starting with the determined Hunter, to  the beautiful Joga having compliments of the Iceland String Quartet, to the  slow and bittersweet Unravel, to the tragic but somehow up-lifting  Bachelorette, to the nice beat to All Neon Like, until you are so absorbed  into the album you reach the end...through the violent climax of the CD:  &quot;Pluto,&quot; which is just flat out cool.  Then, it reaches the  resolution to &quot;All Is Full of Love,&quot; which is one of the most  beautiful songs I have ever heard.  <br />This CD can only be appreciated if  you're ready for it, have an open mind, listen to it several times, and I  appreciate it as a whole...Homogenic is hard to pin-point, and very  mysterious.<br />It's pure genious.  A sonic experiment that works...very  well.
6300208591|5.0|Most critics consider the soulful &quot;La Strada&quot; to be Federico Fellini's masterpiece, but for just plain entertainment nothing beats  &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;. From the opening shot of the Christ statue  suspended from a helicopter blessing the City of God to the final close-up  of the Umbrian angel gazing after the debauched hero (literally stranded  very much like Zampano in &quot;La Strada&quot;), &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;  has one scene after another to fascinate on the first viewing or to  anticipate time and again. I'm sure everyone has his or her favorite  sequence: the sex goddess wading in the Fontana di Trevi, the giggling  children leading a gullible crowd to a &quot;vision&quot; of the Virgin  Mary, or the beach house orgy which climaxes this study of jet-set  corruption. Corruption is the key word here, and the movie was critized for  saying &quot;tsk tsk&quot; to its characters while exploiting their  depravity. The cast (or type-cast) is headed by Marcello Mastroianni as  Marcello, a bachelor who is cat nip to females. Anita Ekberg, a  Swedish-born American movie star, plays ... a Swedish-born American movie  star! On a sadder level, Lex Barker, a washed-up Tarzan, plays a washed-up  Tarzan. The plot consists of Marcello's affairs with a succession of  beauties, including Anouk Aime as a jaded heiress who drifts in and out of  Marcello's life and Yvonne Furneaux as Marcello's mistress, pathetically  attempting domesticity in an unfurnished apartment. Between beds, he  wanders around viewing Roman fever in various locales: a Renaissance  castello, a tacky nightclub (where his visiting father picks up a chorus  girl), and the Via Veneto, crowded with celebrities and sports cars. Rarely  has decadence looked so attractive, photographed in black-and-white  widescreen and hopped-up by Nino Rota's nervous music. (Incredibly, I can't  find a cassette in letter-box format.) Marcello is a journalist who  specializes in tabloid scandal stories. (His sidekick is a ruthlessly  aggressive photographer named Paparazzo -- his plural is  &quot;paparazzi&quot;.) An intellectual acquaintance named Steiner  (hauntingly played by Alain Cuny) encourages Marcello to pursue more  serious writing, but it is Steiner's incomprehensible act of destruction  that finally sends Marcello over the edge, causing him to fall headlong  into the sweet life which becomes increasingly &quot;acida&quot;. Fellini  shows the lassitude and futility of these beautiful but blank lives, the  characters bored and, yes, basically boring. So why is the story so  engrossing? I think it's because the director never repeats himself. Each  sequence is a variation on the same theme. Fellini, fascinated by the  circus, knew how to hold an audience's attention; and in &quot;La Dolce  Vita&quot; he has all three rings going at once: a tremendous life force,  degeneration, and (in the closing shot of the innocent girl's smile) hope.  All you have to do is sit back with a glass of Chianti and enjoy the show.
B00003W8NM|5.0|When I first heard of this movie I waited a long time to see it in the theaters, but i couldn't because I live overseas. So finally when I got  back to the US I got to buy it on DVD and it was well worth it!  Pitt's  acting in this is one of the best, and plot is confusing at first but you  will get it later. An excellent movie!
B00000AFFF|4.0|i was introduced into elvis costello after listening to the suede-version  of &quot;shipbuilding&quot; in the album &quot;help&quot;,i love both the  way elvis &amp; brett perform it. i'm afraid that &quot;painted from  memory&quot; may be a bit pop to me first,but it turned out to be an  excellent melodic album &amp; &quot;god give me strength&quot; is really  moving that i guess only elvis can be the one to sing it perfectly.
B00000J7J4|5.0|This is a fantastic album. I am greatful that such a great artist put out new music during my lifetime. I could listen to this album forever.<br />If  you at all appreciate guitar played well... get this album.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Who the blink cares if it's not a pure punk, when the music blows you away  with its rythm, when the tunes are so catchy that you can't get them out of  your head day and night, and the lyrics are so sweet that you (or some of  your girlfriends) may even cry sometimes. This is Blink again and this time  better than ever.<br />All The Small Things, What's My Age Again, and Adam's  Song are the burying hits, unmistakingly overplayed by radio stations and  taken to MTV. The platinum part of the cd.<br />Anthem, Aliens Exist, Don't  Leave Me, Mutt, and Wendy Clear are another series of brilliant tunes and  funny lyrics. A golden classics of Blink - may we call it so? Let's do it  guys if it doesn't hurt your feelings.<br />The rest on the cd is worth the  above. Probably even better, who knows. It's up to you anyway.<br />The cd is  a real breakthrough, you must know it. The best album of the recent times.  Don't even think of not buying it.<br />P.S. Hey, Blink, any plans for Russia  tour? Bloodhound Gang have already been here.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Marshall Mathers is a brilliant and witty lyricist, as well as a tormented  soul. If you can remember a time in your life when you hated everyone,  including yourself, and can now laugh about it, you will undoubtly find  this album hillarious. If you're easily offended, don't remember dark times  in your life, or are a child, The Marshall Mathers LP is NOT for you.
6305622825|3.0|I saw this movie whilst flying across Europe so that could be why it  didn't grip me, but there is something about a 60+ year old man kissing a  woman half his age that makes my stomach turn. Sean Connery as always is in  top form, back to his 007 days, but this film lacks the fast paced action  we'd come to associate with Connery in his Bond days. The plot is slow and  too static, the movie tends to stick in one location (an old house in the  middle of nowhere) while Connery and Zeta play cat-and-mouse games of  betrayal. There are a few good moments, not knowing who is the bad guy (or  girl) in this movie makes it a little more exciting, but the big question  is WHY? The plot centres around some sort of conspiracy but WHY? A little  too slow, an old Bond movie is always more fun and more exciting. Rent,  watch once then send it back!
B00003W8NM|4.0|Wow... If that word can sum it up, then so be it. The sound and visual effects were great. Brad Pitt is the best when it comes to brain twisted  movies.<br />However, From the feedback I got from most female friends, I  think I can say that Fight Club is a guys movie..
B00000K3UR|2.0|Many people, mainly Adam Sandler and his few friends, thought that this  movie was funny - it isn't. Look Who's Talking is funny, Three Men &amp;  Baby is funny, more recently Ace Ventura and The Mask are funny, but this  isn't. All the best bits, which everyone's seen in the trailer, seem long  winded and drawn out in this movie. Big Daddy Small Laughs I'm afraid. Sure  kids will love it, anyone under the age of 13 will laugh at Sandler's goofy  face, it's just all-round hilarious kids movies have been made before and  are at the cinemas now, don't waste your money or time with a half-witted  video that your kids will grow out of in less then a week. Trust me, they  would like Ace Ventura, Bugs Life or Chicken Run better than this pile of  Adam Sandler.
0385474547|4.0|James Joyce's _Ulysses_ pales in complexity next to Achebe's _Things Fall  Apart_. Yet, unlike Joyce's dizzying array of literary tactics, Achebe's  raw simplicity is refreshing and powerful, rich and resonant. His story of  the rise and eventual fall of a man, Okonkwo, and a tribe, Umuofia, is  executed with great craft that arises from a deep understanding of Nigerian  culture and a great insight into the nature of humanity. The reading of  this novel cannot be separated from a parallel study of Yeats's  &quot;Second Coming&quot;:  <br />&quot;TURNING and turning in the widening  gyre/ The falcon cannot hear the falconer;/ Things fall apart; the centre  cannot hold;/ Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,/ The blood-dimmed tide  is loosed, and everywhere/ The ceremony of innocence is drowned;/ The best  lack all conviction, while the worst/ Are full of passionate  intensity...&quot;

The characters, the story, it all comes  together perfectly to create the greatest Fantasy novel ever written.  You  have to read this novel, regardless of whether you like fantasy or not.

B00004XPOZ|5.0|How is it possible that I have now bought the exact same (well, almost) movies on video tape for now the FOURTH TIME?  Yes, I'm one of those people  who own the original letterbox release, the letterbox THX release, and the  letterbox Special Edition box set.  Now, as soon as Mr. Lucas announces yet  another marketing of the Holy Trilogy, I'm there with my credit card on  Amazon.com!  Heck, I don't even BUY video cassettes anymore, I have a DVD  player!  Why do I keep shelling out hard earned dollars for the same  movies?<br />Well, if you really need to ask that question, you're obviously  not a Star Wars fan.  Without a doubt, there movies have become immortal  for one reason:  they have ressurected the myth genre.  While the Greeks  and Romans had their famous mythologies, Aesop had his fables, and the  Britsh had King Arthur, the last generation of the 20th Century has Star  Wars.<br />We were raised on Star Wars.  Dreams of becoming a Jedi were as  common as future proffessions such as doctor or policeman back at my grade  school.  I doubt a day went by between my fourth and tenth years of life  where the accolades of Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, R2 and 3PO weren't acted  out in my daily play with my friends.  We didn't play &quot;Cowboys and  Indians.&quot;  We played &quot;Rebels and Imperials.&quot;  We didn't have  gun fights, we battled each other with whatever could substitute for a  lightsaber.<br />In retrospect, now that I'm all grwon up, I'm thankful for  Lucas for what he gave me.  These movies laid of a simple play of good  versus evil.  In the end, the quest for virtue will always triumph over the  greed of evil.  They also taught me that if you believe in yourself and  have faith a higher power, you can accomplish anything.  For this, you will  see me ordering this trilogy every time it is released.  Not just for the  &quot;Episode II Behind-The-Scenes&quot; stuff, but basically to give the  well-worn copies I already own a break.  Thank you, Mr. Lucas.  You've  brought great joy into my life and helped to teach me the values I have  today.  Though I don't have children yet, I'm sure that when they come  along, they will be living out the same fantasies I did a long time ago in  a galaxy far, far away...<br />P.S.  Where's the DVDs?
B00000J7J4|5.0|For a kid who grew up listening to Santana while her dad played him on  8-tracks, this new album is a real treat.  It sounds like all of the old  stuff, but a contemporary crowd can get into it as well.  The classic and  signature Santana guitar playing is there, but with some new stuff added  that only makes Santana hightened in my eyes as a living guitar god.  I  knew I would love this album, but the rhythms and riffs make it  irresistible.
B00004U45G|2.0|Sounds cluttered. It's hard to get the feeling of a live performance  accross without distortion.  Much of Page's skill was his perfection in the  studio. Maybe he could have cleaned this one up but then it wouldn't have  been &quot;live&quot;.
B00004W5UA|1.0|FIGHT CLUB was the worst movie I saw so far this year (2000).  It was nothing that I expected.  There was very little true action and even less  &quot;fighting.&quot;<br />This PULP FICTION wanna be sure didn't do it for  me!
B00004SCX6|5.0|...her talent is not created from  finger snap, she works since a little girl to won what she have now. Her new album  is just the reflect of her ambition of being someone in our lifes, someone  to remember. And she is doing an excellent job...Her new song are full of  energy abd lot of mature are reflected on her ballads. She is not the next  Celine Dion but if she is not an artist....WHY SHE IS ON THE TOP OF THE  WORLD right now? As a fan and a concert viewer...she is the best and she's  got a lot of years in the pop world and in our life.
B00004T9UG|5.0|Well I think that this album was tight but like all albums it at least has one sorry song in it like ametyville I didnt understand that one, but the  rest were sweet! Also there are some very controvertial songs in the album  like Kim. I thought that this song was alittle satanic at first, but when I  listened to it more I realized that it was all just a big joke. Anyway this  album is Eminem's best work. It is well worth the money!
0380788624|5.0|This is the first Stephenson novel I read and, definitely not the last. I read this brick of a book on vacation and got little sleep until it was  finished. Stephenson's power of description is truly Devine. The detail,  while not supporting the plot necessarily, lent an air of realism to the  story. It filled in the colorful aspects of the characters and provided me  an infrastructure for my imagination to explode with intense  visions.<br />This novel will consume a lot of time and provide tremendous  distraction to one's mundane stresses in their everyday life. Too bad  Stanley Kubrick is not with us to bring this work to the screen. I could  see the WWII scenes in grainy black and white juxtaposed with brilliant  colors of the eastern Pacific of today.<br />If this book were a Daiquiri it  would be mixed as follows: 1 cup William Gibson, 1 cup Tom Clancy, 1 oz. of  Indiana Jones, 1 oz. of Das Boat, A dash of Ghostbusters, where the geek  gets the girl (Sigorny Weaver), A dash of African Queen, 2 Cups of crushed  ice from Bobby Shaftoe's veins, and blended in a typhoon of human greed,  character, will, and altruism.<br />I guess I liked the book.

B00003CWL6|4.0|I loved the movie alot but the dvd is missing special features.  Rumor has it that there is a ton of deleted footage.  Theres a extended ending that  adds about 9 minutes to movie and flying sequences with kevin spacey.   Unfortunately for us the Director choose to not put that in the dvd  because, it would detract from the film (go figure).  Still a very good  movie, I have not decided whether it is better than sixth sense.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|Leni Riefenstahl's film is an invaluable historical document. Through filming of the Nuremberg Rally and other central moments of the build-up of  the Nazi regime, she inadvertently showed how mass hysteria can subvert an  entire nation's morality. She also created, no matter what her motive, a  cinematic masterpiece, which can be put alongside the films of Eisenstein,  Pabst, Lang and Griffith as the bricks and mortar of modern cinema.  The  Synapse web site suggests they have made a lot of effort in gaining the  best print available of this film. They are letterboxing it with a small  black border around the entire image  so we see everything that Leni framed  for the cinema screen. See it, be abhorred by its content, but appreciate  its cinematic genius.  I hope this is followed by her even greater film  'Olympia', her documentary of the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Hitler meant the  Games to be a celebration of Aryan supremacy. Leni turned it into a paean  of admiration for the great black athlete, Jesse Owens. And to counter the  nazi-regime image presented in both films, let's hope one enlighted company  brings to DVD the early '30s film by Pabst of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt  Weill's Der Dreigroschenoper (The Threepenny Opera), which, as well as  bringing us Lotte Lenya and Mack the Knife, was a key part in the early  fight in Germany between Nazism and socialism.  Well done, Synapse!
B0000041TD|5.0|La lectura que hace Herbert Von Karajan es sencillamente extraordinaria,  apoyado con un elenco de primer nivel. Esta interpretaci&oacute;n est&aacute; llena de  esa pasi&oacute;n pucciniana que nos hace poner los pelos de punta. Fuertemente  recomendada.
B000022TTS|5.0|Walter Lord titled his book about the Titanic sinking &quot;A Night To Remember&quot; and this film is one that will ALWAYS be remembered, for it  is perfect, absolutely perfect. The costumes are wonderful, the acting is  wonderful, the special effects are wonderful, and the props, which were  exact replicas of the items which were found on the real Titanic, are  wonderful. The maiden voyage of the doomed Titanic is the setting for the  touching love story about Rose DeWitt Bukator, an unhappily engaged society  girl (Winslet) and Jack Dawson, a poor as a church mouse artistically  gifted drifter (DiCaprio).  It is a story that will touch your heart,  inspire you, move you to tears, and make you ponder over one thought in  particular - the thought that perhaps there was a real life Jack and Rose  aboard the real Titanic.  Perhaps romance blossomed between 2 passengers  during the 4 days prior to the sinking of the vessel, a romance that was  destined never to come to fruitition.  It's a sad thought, isn't it?  And  it is wonderful to see that in such a cynical age, a glorious and beautiful  movie such as this can emerge from the cash for trash rota of Hollywood,  depicting the sinking itself and the loss of so many lives in such a  sensitive, non exploitive way.  For that is really what the story of  Titanic is about - the death of over 1500 passengers and crew, but through  the many books and movies which have documented this tragedy so well for  the past 88 years, they, and the ship itself, have achieved the status of  immortality and will never and should never be forgotten.
0800105141|3.0|I like this film in some ways, but there are historical inaccuracies.   First, someone mentioned that Kingsley is Indian. This is only partly true,  because he is only a quarter Indian.  So, there is something to the  argument of &quot;why couldnt they find a real Indian Actor?&quot;  I think  its a fair question.<br />second - Nehru is seen as defering to Ghandi  throughout the film. This is a false portrayal. Nehru had his own fiercly  held independent beliefs, and although the two men were friends, they had  serious differences over the Mother Cow laws, to name just one example.   Nehru was more influenced by Moghul and English culture, and held on to  that.  Hr even once said that he was probably the last Englishman to rule  India. And he never deferred to Gandhi. <br />Also - this portrayal of Ghandi  the saint.  In real life, he was complicated.  But I guess we are asking  too much sometimes when we want film to portray people as morally  complicated. The truth is he probably wasnt a very good father. His  children hated him. One of them became a muslim because he hated his father  so much, and later an alcoholic.<br />There is much more to this man than  meets the eye.  So, do yourself a favor.  Use this film not as your sole  source of knowing about this period of history.  After all, you shouldnt  rely on film as your only source of understanding history. If you do, your  never really going to know anything. So, do yourself a favor and read a few  books as well, and you will not have a one-dimensional understanding of  history. If you rely on only this film, you remain uninformed.

080013558X|5.0|Little Orphan Annie is one of the greatest role models a child living in the nineties could have. I remember seeing the show for the first time,  enraptured by the little girl my age who &quot;stuck up her chin&quot; and  took whatever life dished out and was still able to help out less fortunate  girls than herself. It was certainly a welcome change from many other forms  of media encouraging females to be, well, stereotypically feminine. I  thought it was the best thing in the world to see a child, a girl no less,  stand up to adults with her spunky courage. It gives the young viewer a  sense of power, kinship perhaps, to know that they aren't the only ones who  have had a difficult time in life, to know that they could be a lot worse  off. Perhaps some of the less positive reviewers could look at this from a  child's perspective, see the movie with innocent, unjaded eyes. And while I  first and last saw this film eight or so years ago, I am still profoundly  moved by Little Orphan Annie's courage and strength, regardless of the  feelings of so many others.
6305905401|4.0|only because the director, Roman Polanski, is an old-fashioned craftsman who knows how to properly build a narrative, create atmosphere, shock you  with an unexpected visual, all the while studiously avoiding cliches . . .  and all without some big stupid explosion billowing in slo-mo while some  jerk runs toward the camera manfully  (again in slo-mo).  Withholding  information from the audience, then revealing it at the unexpected moments,  layering the characters -- in short, professional storytelling in the old  murder-mystery vein -- are lost arts which one typically has to go back to  the early 1980's to find, an era before computer technology and overbearing  camerawork made such painstaking craft no longer necessary to the  attention-span-deprived American audience.  *The Ninth Gate*  is all in the  details, baby.  If such nuances don't impress you, or seem boring to you,  better look elsewhere.  *End of Days*  would be a fine start.  No nuances  there to  &quot;bog&quot;  you down.<br />Having said all that, I must say  that this movie lacked a couple of key ingredients that would have made it  an emotionally satisfying picture.  Number one, having the Depp character  be SUCH a moral blank, especially as the film progresses, only serves to  deflate the tension -- in other words, nothing seems to be at stake.   Depp's soul is already lost; so is going to Hell any sort of change?  Also,  Polanski played his hand a bit early with the Mystery Blonde Girl.  Once  she starts floating in the air and kicking people around a la The  Incredible Hulk, it's no secret that she's a minion of Satan  (or even  Satan Himself -- it scarcely matters).  MORE mystery, not LESS, was needed  where she's concerned.  And the movie is really too long -- especially when  you consider the puzzling finish, which is really a confusing muddle . . .  unnecessarily confusing, I may add.<br />All in all, though, one of the more  satisfying movies of last year, especially for those who enjoythe craft of  filmmaking itself.  Those who require kickboxing matches once per half-hour  and actors floating through the soupy-looking air of CGI   &quot;magic&quot;, need not apply. . . .
1573226521|3.0|Like &quot;The Lord of The Flies&quot;, &quot;The Beach&quot;, is about a  group of people trying to maintain a type of peaceful government on there  own on a deserted island.  Unlike &quot;The Lord of The Flies&quot;, in  which the characters are waiting to be rescued, &quot;The Beach&quot;, is  where minimal contact with the rest of 'the world' is obstained from and  frowned upon as an invasion of their own private Eden.   That's why when an  Englishman, and his two French traveling companions, who are given a map to  this tropical utopia by &quot;Daffy&quot;, are very unwelcome when they  reach their destination.  As they are assimilated into the commune, they  are assigned jobs to help out the rest of the population.  However,  discontent arises among the masses, and a rift between two opposing  factions is revealed.  This break in unity is the group's tragic downfall  into oppression and murder.<br />The book's simple language, and it's short  paragraph structure made for a very fast paced novel, although the  protagonist's hallucinations were very annoying, and not engaging.  Also,  as in reading &quot;The Lord of The Flies&quot;, the ending left my stomach  queasy, and my thoughts disturbed.  Although I will read more from this  exceptionally talented author, the calibre of this novel was not up to par  with the great classic.
6302720419|2.0|I remember channel surfing at about age 10 or 11 and coming across this movie on tv. I lived in a very rural area with lots of corn fields. I'm grasping now: but some of the &quot;images&quot; in this film work on a  horror level. Particularly the boy running in the corn field at the  beginning and the couple driving on the desolate highway surrounded by  corn. But that's about it. This movie plays like a really cheesy  made-for-tv movie. I'd never seen the whole thing and watched it tonight.  This is the kind of movie to watch with a few friends on a &quot;bad  movie&quot; night because it's fodder for you to shout at the screen. This  is the kind of movie that is fun to make fun of if only MST3K were to have  gotten a hold of this one. I love Stephen King and horror films--I am a  buff but skip this one and read the AWESOME short story which is genuinely  creepy. Thank God people like Frank Darabont make GREAT Stephen King  adaptions now. Don't treat this as a &quot;Stephen King&quot; flick but as  cheesy, late-night guilty fun. I won't &quot;ruin&quot; the ending but I  was rather dissappointed.
6305897786|3.0|Roman Polanski has put some very cool images on film with this one. THE NINTH GATE is not his best film but certainly it is much better than recent  films on the subject of 'Satan'. I'm a horror-film buff and found  'Stigmata' to be tedious and convoluted for the most part. 'End of Days'  starred Arnold and since he is one of my favorite stars I enjoyed it but it  was a big, dumb movie *not that there's anything wrong with that* but 'THE  NINTH GATE' is a thinking-man/woman's horror film. <br />Disturbing images  abound and great set-pieces like the various murders are well done. This  film is a real &quot;journey.&quot;  It also captures a sort of  'Maltese-Falcon~ish' noir at times. The finale is interesting and makes one  want to re-watch it several times with and without the commentary on the  well-done DVD. The animated menus rock!  Also, the score is very well done.  It's one of those musical scores that you would want to purchase in  addition to the film (although there is an isolated score on the DVD!) this  movie isn't for everyone though. If you've got an open mind and you are a  Polanski fan then check it out. All otheres beware....you may not care for  the 'NINTH GATE' that much.
B000009QPE|4.0|This is the finest and most influential piece of death metal ever recorded. No one can ever match the evilness, ferocity, or speed for that matter of this Slayer classic. The lyrics, which some people say are  mindless, are not. For example Angel of Death which detals the horrific  experiments of a Nazi doctor. For all you people out there calling Slayer  nazis, just because their lyrics are about them doesn't mean that are. Or  Jesus Saves, which shows the songwriter's views on christianity. The guitar  work of this album is some of the best ever. One of Slayer's greatest  things is that they always stay together and nothing ever sounds tacked on,  they also never get silly and dumb like some other bands out there, namely  Cannibal Corpse. As great as this album is, there are a few things that  stopped me from giving this album 5 stars. The songs can sound a little  repititous once you've heard them all.Also the song subjects can get a  little repitious. The album is just way too short, it has the length of an  EP on an album. Don't let these things stand in your way of getting this.  Put it in you CD player, crank up Angel of Death, Jesus Saves, Postmortem,  and last but not least, Raining Blood. [...]<br />DOWN WITH THE TRENDS
B00000K19E|5.0|When I went to go see this at the theater I expected it to be a very cool  movie. I left the theater thinking wow what a fantstic sci-fi thiller.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; fulfilled my expectations about it and more. It has  it all, mind-blowing special effects, some romance between Neo and Trinity,  an awesome villian named Agent Smith, great plot, killer soundtrack and the  list goes on and on.  Fishburne was excellent in his role as Morpheas and  the movie had very memorable parts like where Neo and Trinity take out all  the cops and military guys, the helicopter scene, the kung-fu fighting  between both Neo and Morpheas (In the middle or so of the Movie) and Neo  and Agent Smith (Around the end or so). The story carries out at a steady  rate which pretty much keeps it from ever getting boring and has a  spectacular ending. I don't  really expect everyone to like this movie but  I do recommend it for checking out and renting if you havn't seen it yet. I  can't wait for the other sequals although I don't really expect them to  be  as good as the first Matrix film. Peace to all.
B00000BKI4|5.0|Once in a while, an album comes along that suddenly finds itself occupying  the space in your car, home, and work CD player. Before I found this album,  Radiohead's OK Computer was it. And before that, King Crimson's Discipline  (Ok, so I am a little outdated. Great music has no time limit!).  I own  Yerself is Steam and Boces, two previous efforts by Mercury Rev. These guys  must have attended some group counseling sessions or given up their lives  as bank robbers to procure a life of religion. Talk about growing up and  seeing the other side! This is a full-range album, straddling the high wire  of life, from deeply regretful (The Funny Bird) to outright raucous (Delta  Sun Bottleneck Stomp). Let this album play in the background at first;  don't be quick to try to &quot;see&quot; what I am talking about. Let it be  absorbed. After a week or two of constant playing, try and figure out what  Jonathan is exactly trying to say. You'll be glad you did.
B00004XPP0|5.0|You are looking at the greatest science fiction trilogy of all time. These 3 original star wars movies started it all and I hope  Episodes 2 and 3  live up to them, not like Episode 1 which failed miserably. Some of the  special effects in the original films are still amazing to watch even today  with movies like &quot;The  Matrix&quot;, &quot;Blade&quot;, &quot;Hollow  Man&quot; and many others. So if you don't yet have this trilogy I highly  suggest you buy it today. Peace to  ALL star wars fans.
0783225733|5.0|Director Ron Howard's acclaimed 1995 space drama about the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission. This has been one of my favorite movies since the first  time I saw it in the theater. High drama, great character moments, and an  exploration of the human spirit, all brought together masterfully on the  screen with innovative filmmaking techniques, great special effects, and a  brilliant score by composer James Horner.<br />Ron Howard captures the spirit  and reality of the Apollo era in an amazingly accurate and entertaining  film.  There are certain sacrifices in accuracy for dramatic value, but  overall, the message and story are delivered intact.  The work and  attention to detail put into this film is phenomenal.<br />The DVD release  doesn't disappoint.  This was one of the first &quot;fully-loaded&quot;  discs before special edition releases became common.  First is a very  interesting an informative documentary on the making of the film.  There's  not one, but two commentary tracks included (one with director Ron Howard,  and one will real-life hero Jim Lovell and wife Marilyn).  Commentaries are  my favorite aspect of the DVD format, because they allow the director  and/or people who worked on the film to provide the viewer with their own  personal perspective on their work.  Both of these commentaries are  informative and interesting.<br />The acting is great.  The story is great.  The DVD is great.  Pick this up - you won't be sorry.
0316777722|1.0|Mr. Sedaris has a great talent--unfortunately he puts little of it to use in Me Talk Pretty One Day.  Compared to his earlier works, the best of  which exhibited sardonic abandon tempered with genuine humanity, his latest  autobiographical foray will most likely disappoint eager readers looking  for a good laugh.   <br />Sure, there are moments where the author whips off a  zinger, like when he conjures an image of his heavily accented speech  therapist (\\"Her people undoubtedly drank from clay jugs and hollered for  Paw when the vittles were ready...\\").  But more often than not, Sedaris gives  readers uninspired chapters devoted to base topics, like large turds that  won't flush down the toilet.  (Okay, fecal humor is not my bag, but even if  you get off on this sort of thing, the execution is flat.)  <br />In previous  works a sharp wit like Sedaris would have made something more out of an  Information Age commentary or a vindictive French teacher, but what he  offers up in \\"Nutcracker.com\\" and part \\"deux\\" of his book is surprisingly  flaccid and not just a little bit predictable.  <br />It seems to me that the  big idea for this book was to sell massive amounts of product.  That being  the case, our author should have wrapped the pages around a roll and placed  them on the shelf in Aisle 5, along side the other packages of toilet  paper.
B0000039PW|5.0|evil, OR UNBELIEVEABLE&quot;    BIG definitely started a whole new movement in rap, like LOX said in their tribute, he made thugs wanna go and  buy a new shirt, at once funny, hard, clever, and weeded. He was positive  and negative, overall promoting a vision of everyone living well, with  money, truly working for theirs, and at the same time explaining the  frustration that goes along with trying to achieve such lofty dreams and  the extent one must go to to do so.  &quot;The What&quot; featuring Meth,  &quot;Juicy&quot; (first single, a true classic), the Preemo produced  &quot;Unbelieveable,&quot; the sick &quot;Suicidal Thoughts,&quot;  &quot;Big Poppa,&quot; &quot;Everyday Struggle,&quot; and  &quot;Warning&quot; are among the album's greatest tracks.  2Pac called out  BIG for biting his style with the versace etc., but somehow Biggie seemed  more accessible, more easy to relate to, not so  crazy and outlandish like  2pac, just a flawed human being with skills and appetites.
B00004THAY|1.0|This CD must be one of the worst ever. Eric Clapton isn't GOD, he is an overated show-off. Very boring. Disagree about the album or about Clapton himself...
6305905401|1.0|so many times i felt sure that a story was about to develop and so many  times i was wrong... when the credits rolled i sat in shock and then turned  to my left and saw my friend wearing the same look on his face... i call it  the &quot;was that it?&quot; face... im sure most of you are farmiliar with  that expression.<br />maybe the film was advertised incorrectly, maybe my  hopes were to high (silly me i wanted to be entertained)<br />jonny depp whos  diverse roll choices from edward scissor hands to gilbert grape has shown a  range of acting that has become all but extinct but he never quite jells  with this character ... a character that is so hollow that even HE couldnt  save it... in fact no character in the story is very stimulating... even  the flying mystery woman on the motorcycle hardly raises an  eyebrow...<br />this is a film of missed oppurtunities. several times it  appears to go in an interesting direction but twists right back to the  mundane... the conclusion is more of the same - somewhat of a buildup but  another disapointment as fails to deliver yet again..... feel free to skip  it
0156347113|3.0|This book is certainly interesting from a historical perspective.  As  others on this page have pointed out, Keynes' General Theory has had a  profound impact on the world in the later half of the twentieth  century.<br />I do hope, however, that no one takes it seriously as an  economic text.  Few theories have been more completely discredited than the  General Theory.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|I am posting this review in response to the many negative reviews of the DVD version on this site. I held off purchasing this, one of my favorite  movies, on DVD for a long time because of these reviews. Having finally  purchased it, I find the complaints about the picture quality to be vastly  overstated. I noticed several occasions were there was a small jitter in  the picture, but overall the picture is definately superior to the VHS  version. Also, the director's cut is nowhere near as bad as people have  said... it is different but not really better or worse. Actually, I think  the ending of the director's cut is superior. It would be nice to have both  versions of the film on DVD (and to have the 'making-of' that is on the VHS  on the DVD), but I am definately not disappointed that I purchased this DVD!
158234082X|3.0|Anthony Bourdain definately could have used an editor in completing this book.  I was surprised by the typos, and overall organization of the  book.<br />Kitchen Confidential is not a tell-all book about the  behind-closed-kitchen-doors business, but more of a personal life story  about the author.  In the book, we find out about his raw oyster-eating  youth, and his dabbling with drugs later on.  He did lead an interesting  life, and his climb to his prestigious status as a top chef is well  documented.  But, there is very little else.<br />He uses a lot of cooking  terms that I truly didn't understand, and he doesn't define these until you  are almost at the end of the book.  I was mildly pleased with his not  holding anything back, as he tells it like he sees it, but the language was  either too descriptive or not detailed enough in their respective parts.  I  made it to the end of the book simply because I wanted to see what the  seemingly arrogant Mr. Bourdain was going to do next.<br />In all honesty, it  was a wild ride of a story, but better structure and the help of an editor  would have made it a much nicer read.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Since I bought &quot;Love Scenes&quot; about a year ago, I have absolutely  fallen in love with Diana Krall's music.  I believe she is the foremost  rising jazz star of our time!<br />Although I like the simpler, more intimate  sound of her earlier recordings, &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; is  truly wonderful too.  Diana's other recordings are with her trio of  musicians and have a more intimate jazz club performance sound.<br />On this  recording, Diana employs Johnny Mandel's string arrangements as well as her  own musicians to create a larger sound.  Don't get me wrong, the sound is a  little less intimate, but certainly still very good.  As a matter of fact,  most listeners would likely prefer this sound.<br />If you are not tempted to  compare Diana's voice and style to other legendary jazz vocalists and keep  an open mind, it's likely you'll find yourself wanting all her recordings.  I don't tend to compare musicians with each other, because they each have  their own style and should be enjoyed independently.<br />That said, I can  heartily recommend this album to jazz lovers and all music lovers.  You'll  miss out on something very special if you don't discover Diana Krall's  special gift.  I have seen her in concert, and she was delightful and the  music was sensational!  If you fall in love with her music too, please do  yourself a favor and see her vocal and keyboard skills in person.<br />But,  first start by getting this album and seeing what the fuss is all about!
6305499365|4.0|I love this movie. After watching it once, I could identify 4 or 5 parallels to people I work with on a daily basis. I rented this movie once  and decided that when it went to &quot;priced to buy&quot; status, I had to  own it.  The story becomes a little weak from the &quot;virus&quot; bit.  But, the overall characters stand out in this movie. I know two guys at  work who remind me of Milton(both are squirrelly and mumble a lot). Mr.  Lumberg(&quot;what's happenin?&quot;)reminds me of a guy who would  say(every morning),&quot;whaddya know?&quot;. I also have two friends at  work who have the same names as celebrities (ie-Michael Bolton). Both Don  Johnson and Mike Wallace are both employed at the same place.....and I'm  not talking about CBS. If you see it once and recognize someone or  something that makes you laugh about your own place of work, then this is  the movie for you to own.
0780626966|5.0|this is the best set of dvd's ever. The extra features are outstanding.  The first nightmare beats all of them though. while the funny freddy is  cool its better to have the dark freddy. dont even waste your time though  with nightmare 2 the sound, picture, and the movie itself is worse then  dumb. The best part of this collection is the extra dvd that has really  cool stuff. back when I was little I was being baby-sat by my cousin she  liked to watch MTV, when she went to the bathroom freddy kruger came on,  that was the first time i ever saw freddy kruger. After I bought this set  and put in the extra dvd i had no idea that i was going to see that freddy  MTV thing. This set will coast you alot but you will never once ask  yourself why you bought this.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is one of the three best sequels ever made, behind only Empire Strikes Back and Terminator 2: Judgement Day in my opinion.  The audio and  video quality of this DVD edition are superb.<br />This DVD is packed full of  extras, including a theatrical trailer, interview with director James  Cameron, and over 20 minutes of additional footage that help add depth to  the story (including a motion-sensing gun sequence that I can remember  seing somewhere before).  This DVD is a must for Sci-Fi/Action Adventure  fans.
0393312836|5.0|I have read this book twice and as I was reading it the second time I  realised it was a lot more violent and brutal than I originally remember.   this was probaly beacause the overall mood and message stuck in my head as  opposed to alex and his droogs acts.  If you are at all skeptical that you  will not like this because of content, don't worry.  It is more than well  worth it.  Oh and if you were at all disapointed at the way Orwell's 1984  ended as I was, try this.
0553328255|5.0|There is no reason not to purchase the complete Sherlock Holmes collection. Not only is this great recreational reading, but it is very  educational as well. Holmes is, in my opinion, the most fully developed  person in all of fiction. After reading all the stories and novels thrice  as I have, you come to understand what it takes to develop a character so  real that many will attest that he actually existed. The stories are also  great for the mind, as the reader continually tries to match wits with  Holmes in each mystery. This collection contains both short reading  (stories which can be read in 45 minutes) and involved novels. When buying  this book, I suggest that you not have anything important to do for a few  months, as it is impossible to put the book down. I am not a heavy reader,  and being a college student, I almost detest reading altogether, yet the  works of Arthur Conan Doyle have always kept me glued to each page. If you  don't like Sherlock Holmes, you are probably retarded.
B00003CWL5|5.0|Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, and an all-star cast star in the darkly comic and genuinely funny film about a suburban family who has a thirst for  difference.<br />Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, an unhappy-chappy who  decides to quit his job, blackmail his boss, smoke marijuana, and pursue  his daughter's friend, Mena Suvari.<br />Annette Benning is his real estate  agent wife who is so frustrated with her job and Lester's outlandish  behavior that she begins an extra-marital affair with her hardest  competition, Peter Gallagher.<br />Their daughter, palyed by Thora Birch is a  desperate teenager who hates her irrational parents, and begins a romance  with her next door neighbour, Wes Bently that could change her  life.<br />Those are the Burnhams, and surrounding them is an insane world  that they all despise.<br />AMERICAN BEAUTY is a beauty of a film, that will  leave you astonished at it's power, and black comedy mixed in with sad  drama.<br />Even though the film is mostly a comedy, smart viewers (who happen  to be the only people I would reccomend this movie to) will g\find that  during all the comedy, there is a deep feeling of despair (and great acting  and directing)<br />American Beauty has few flaws, but is not for people who  have prejiduces against homo-sexuality, not-too-bright-folks, and anyone  who doesn't like this movie, has something else about them that causes  their dis-like for this wonderful motion picture.

6305426651|5.0|All it took was &quot;seven seconds&quot; for me to know I would love this movie.<br />Filmed in Italy, it is best if you get the subtitled version, for  dubbing is not very effective.<br />Italian comedy actor/director Roberto  Benigni and his wife Nicoletta Braschi give outstanding performances in the  best film of the year without competition, La Vita E Bella.<br />Taking place  throughout the second world war, this movie starts off as a boy meets girl  hilarious comedy, but turns into a terrifying drama about a father  protecting his boy when they are sent to a concentration camp.<br />La Vits E  Bella is most definitely in the top five films ever made in ANY country.  <br />I reccomend this movie for all who have ever laughed or cried at a  movie...  and just about everyone else.
0345349571|5.0|Barbara Tuchman is a great guide for readers beginning their voyage into medieval history. This is also a marvellous period, in terms of action,  romance and great events, with which to begin such a journey.<br />  I would  also urge readers who are spurred on to further investigation, to read the  seminal text from which much of Tuchman's work is based, the Chronicles of  Jean Froissart. Froissart was one of the great raconteurs of any age. He  was basically the Herodotus and Homer of his era.<br />  The Amazon reviewer  might have noted that Enguerrand's disposition towards the peasants under  him was dictated to him  by one of the truly cataclysmic events of the era.  The uprising of the Jacquerie created a hitherto unknown fear and unease on  the part of the aristocratic order of the time, to such a degree that  reprisals and attitudes were indeed shaped for generations to come. But one  must read Froissart to reach a true appreciation of the scope and social  repercussions of that horrifying event. The Jaquerie were bent on total  devestation of the upper classes and carried out their revolution in  countless acts of rape, murder, infanticide and any other mayhem they could  engender. Enguerrand was seen as an avenging Angel by his contemporaries.  The lords, barons and knights were not merely defending their order, but  their lives.<br />  This is Tuchman's finest accomplishment, in terms of  rendering historical drama and in the cohesive quality of the details she  marshals to illustrate her story. It really was not just a calamitous, but  quite a remarkable century in terms of the wars that were fought, the  leaders of France and England that fought them and the hardships the nobles  and the commons all endured. It definitely was not an era for the timid or  the weak either in body or in spirit. I guarantee that if you read this  work, which is as exciting as any novel, you will want to read the  chronicles as well.
6304466498|4.0|Someone just had to say it.  This film is a hilarious satire with tons of Star Wars references not to mention crude humor.  Is there anything Mel  Brooks can't do?  He even makes the film feel like a serious sci-fi film at  times, but then the mention of something like a maid &quot;sucking and  blowing&quot; the air out of a planet sets you back into top comic wrap  speed.    <br />The cast is great with the quick zingers but mostly it is Rick  Moranis as Dark Helmet.  He's a finny little guy and his quick witty lines  are cleverly timed.  Let's get into the story which is leads us to the  Planet Drewida where the Princess is about to be married off to an uncaring  prince.  At the same time planet of people know as the Spaceballs plan to  take the air of the Planet.  Leave it up to Bill Pullman and John Candy  playing a Han Solo and Chewbacca like characters respectively to save the  day.  They decide to help the princess (played by Daphine Zaniga) and her  sassy robot gal pal (voiced by Joan Rivers) out in order to get out of debt  of Pizza the Hut.  The insanity doesn't end there as the villains try to  find out  that the Princess has escaped the planet and to help their cause  for stealing Drewida's air.  <br />So there is the story.  And basically a  bunch of chaos insues, but the movie plays like an actually action movie  with a few spoofs quality.  The jokes are so adult (not necessarily sexual,  but adult) that I think the film plays as a satire rather than a silly  spoof with cheap little sight gags that kids will love.  What surprises me  is the fact that there is so much swearing and ethnic jokes and the movie  only got a PG rating.  Mel Brooks is a genius and his jokes of promotion of  the movie in the movie are too funny and very typical of the timing of the  release (1987).  I must say that if you love silly stuff and are an adult,  you're going to love this movie.  Not those that are easily offended  though.
B00000DRA9|5.0|This movie has been my all time favorite. Not only because of the story  (the never ending one) but also because the Music scores that are  absolutely stupendous. Its the music of The Never Ending Story that creates  the atmosphere while watching the movie. It actually brings out the inner  fantasies alive. <br />I strongly recommend this music album for those who  love melodious yet mysterious and fantastical journey to Fantasia. My  favorites are the theme song and Atreju's Quest. <br />Have a nice time  listening to The Never Ending Story.
0783225792|2.0|The main detractor here was the violence. I don't mind violence in movies at all, and I really don't mind gore here and there when necessary, but  this movie goes all out to almost B-movie type of violence. I mean you  better not be eating when you watch this, or whatever you're eating is  probably going to come up. A guy gets stabbed to death with an ink pen, of  all things - as if they ran out of ways to kill people with various sharp  objects that will produce as much blood as possible, so they decided to use  a PEN. A lady gets shot through the side of the head, and you're left  seeing blood squirt from the wound as she crumples to the floor. Pesci and  a couple dudes torture a guy by crushing his head in a vice; his eye pops,  blood squirts up out of his mouth or something - which is probably one of  the worst. There's dozens of others too and I don't have time to get into  all of them, but the movie is capped off with Pesci and his friend being  beaten to death with metal ball bats. Casino left me wondering, among other  things, how this team will kill people in the next one! <br />   The best  thing about it was, when people weren't being brutally killed, the acting.  DeNiro, Pesci, and Rickles are all stellar. Pesci is totally hilarious as  his usual loose-cannon Mafia character. There's a scene in a bar/restaurant  where he tells a guy off for not paying his bills that's the funniest thing  I've ever seen. The biggest surprise, though, was Rickles. Don needs to be  in more serious parts like this, because he can act! <br />   It's classic  Scorsese as well - complete with every falling apart in the end. There  seems to be less attention to the &quot;period&quot; than in Goodfellas and  more of an emphasis on glamour and glitzy sets pieces. Goodfellas had  '50's, '60's, and '70's virtually embossed right on the screen through  style, music, cars, etc. Casino skips right over those things and opens,  oddly, in documentary style (not just, &quot;I always wanted to be a  gangster...&quot;) and continues that way for about 50 minutes. Casino is  certainly not a movie you want to avoid, it's very worth watching, but  don't expect it to be the experience that Goodfellas was.

B000002JNN|5.0|This is a great AC/DC CD.  The band sounds great.  The only downside is  that Phil Rudd isn't on drums.  Thunderstruck, Fire Your Guns, and  Moneytalks are excellent!! The rest of the CD is good, but not their best.   But, it's a great listen, so why complain.  The sound is more metal than  there other albums.  It reminds me of how the Stones changed their sound on  Steel Wheels.  Bottomline: A great buy for any AC/DC fan.
0140042520|5.0|Having heard me praise this book countless times, my wife finally read it for herself. Her response? \\"You know, I was expecting some stereotype of  `cool' Beatniks, trying to be so hip and detached. But that's just some  popular media image. The people in this book are exuberant, thoughtful,  even spiritual!\\" That sums it up as well as anything. Forget the glib idea  of alterna-cultural one-upmanship that passes for a Beat attitude these  days - \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is about naïve exuberance, anything-but-ironic  soul-searching, an eager exploration of life's sorrows and joys, and the  sheer, exhilarating, wondrous zest of being alive and aware in an endlessly  fresh world. If reading this clear mountain stream of a book doesn't make  you want to change your life and your way of looking at life, then you're  just hopelessly blind to something precious! Life is so much more than the  neatly packaged, pre-imagined commercial that society would love to sell  you, and \\"The Dharma Bums\\" will gladly show you one possible way of finding  your true path.
B00004LN16|5.0|Wow, this is a great CD.  Ac/Dc's best since Back In Black.  It's been  called Back in Black II, not b/c it's similair...but b/c it's great!! I  love it more than Back In Black and Highway.  Brain Johnson sounds much  better than he did on Ballbreaker.  Bottomline: A must have for any AC/DC  fan.
B00004XPP0|1.0|First of all, I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, but watching the re-released  trilogy left me feeling sick to my stomach. It is my firm belief that  George Lucas has become completely senile! And I'm not referring to that  complete debacle known as the Phantom Menace. He has ruined the original  three too! First of all, there is no redeemable features from the new  versions. The new scenes look completely out of place with the antiquated  effects of the original versions. Sure, some of the old effects were  cheesy, like Luke's speeder, but at least the gave the movie  continuity...seeing old and new affects insults me. One of my favorite  parts of the first one was the scene with Greedo and Han...they ruined it.  Then they insert this ridiculous scene with Jaba into the first one. Jaba  looks entirely two-dimensional, especially, if you look closely, Jaba's  entire mass fits between Han's arm and the front of his torso. I agree to  that the scene with Luke and his old buddy was completely out of place too  and only hurts the film. A major problem I also have with all three  &quot;enhanced&quot; versions is the lasers and lightsabers...they look  like Mike'n'Ike candies...they're more neon and brighter now, but still  look like they just colored over the original film. The old lasers weren't  great, but they didn't look like someone colored over them with a magic  marker. If they wanted to improve the original, they should have fixed  MISTAKES, like when you can tell Obi-Wan's lightsaber is just a wire and it  sizzles. Next is the ESB. This was probably the least offensive of the SE  versions. A new scene with the snow monster..and some scenes from the Cloud  City that again seem completely out of place and disrupt the continuity of  the movie. Then we come to the Return of the Jedi, which made me furious.  This enhanced version is completely worthless. They add this really, REALLY  lame digitized scene to the part where the band is playing in Jaba's throne  room. The creatures all look ridiculous and very poorly done, especially  the furry creature they added...which basically just embarrassed me. It  looks like a cross between a cartoon and fraggle rock, and that in a room  next to darkness and guys like Bobafet....need I say more? I will! The  worse part of this, is I actually liked the old song by Jaba's band...this  one is terrible. Then there is a new scene with the Sarlacc Pit  Monster...where they actually made it so a head would come out of the pit.  Totally ruined the seen. Monster looks sooo cheesy and ruins the mystery of  &quot;what is this thing?&quot;...all it is is this thing that looks like a  cross between a worm from &quot;Tremors&quot; and the venus flytrap from  that movie with Rick Moranis. Everything is ok from here until the very  ending, which they have completely changed. Gone is the scenes with the  ewoks and now is scenes from Coruscant and the Cloud City of people  dancing, which, again, are completely out of place. And the worse part? The  song!!! The old one was kind of catchy and uplifting. Now it's just some  stupid anthem with a flute that sounds worthy of Celine Dion. My final word  on the SE Trilogy: Don't buy it! Go to a garage sale and buy the originals.  Rent them, copy them, tape them off of USA if you have to.
B000007S5B|4.0|Although it seems that many people dislike this Album, I love it alot. One  of my favorite Doors song is in here &quot;Love Street&quot;, it's just  incredible. I also think that &quot;Summer's almost gone&quot; is one of  the most underrated Doors songs ever and should have been on their best of  album. &quot;Hello I love you&quot; is a pretty nice song, very remarkable  though. The whole record has something that is hard to descripe, a feeling  I get everytime I hear the doors. But maybe that's just me. &quot;We could  be so good together&quot; is not quite my favorite song on the record,  again I don't know why. &quot;Not to touch the Earth&quot; is a  demonstration of acid effects on song writing, it's the Doors at their most  psychodelic. &quot;The unknown Soldier&quot; is a great song as well. This  was the first Doors record I bought, after knowing the &quot;Best of&quot;,  and I love it a lot.

0064407667|2.0|Always on the quest to find books that will please my 8 and 9 year olds, I tried Lemony Snicket. The novel starts with the sudden death of the parents  of the three Baudelaire children and the gutting of their home by fire.  Things go downhill for them from there. <br />The book is heavily ironic and  affected. It keeps an &quot;isn't this clever&quot; barrier between itself  and the reader. My kids snickered once or twice but they were obviously not  drawn in by the plight of the unfortunate Baudelaire orphans. <br />One  gimmick Mr. Snicket uses is to define some words within the narration.  Surprisingly, this was what my kids liked the best, particularly when the  explanations were for the utterances of the baby. <br />With Harry Potter and  Holes, my kids begged me each night to read just one more chapter and  failing that just one more word. Not so with Lemony Snicket.  We won't be  reading Book 2.
B00000IPAX|3.0|Sometimes it's great to be oblivious.  I don't watch much television, listen to the radio or read the big music magazines, so I'm pretty  (happily) out of touch with popular music.  I encounter new music through  friends or just by wandering through the record store (or clicking my way  through Amazon) in search of something interesting.  So I'd heard of Blink  182 before, but didn't know a thing about them until I picked up  &quot;Enema of the State&quot; from a stack of CDs at a friend's house and  asked out of curiosity to borrow it.  I was pleased by what I heard:  amphetimine-velocity guitar riffs, lots of loud dirty guitars, plenty of  catchy hooks and some unpretentious, amusing lyrics.  Sure this is pop  music, and I'm certain these guys get plenty of airplay, but I can't feel  too guilty about liking the album because, when you come right down to it,  it's a pretty fun little collection.  Some of the great punk themes are  here, too: crazy girlfriends (&quot;Dumpweed&quot;), paranoia (&quot;Aliens  Exist&quot;), the inability to grow up (&quot;What's My Age Again&quot;)  and loneliness (&quot;Adam's Song&quot;).  This may not be the Ramones, and  Blink 182 may remind you of Green Day (who, to my mind, are not as funny),  but &quot;Enema of the State&quot; is loud, fast and keeps your foot  tapping, all of which are elements that make rock and roll worth listening  to.  Good job, fellas.
6302881005|4.0|I own this. I love it. It's one of my favorites. The Demi and Woody characters are stupid for thinking they could go to Las Vegas and win it  all on the tables, but it's been done before.  I think it's an entertaining  film. It keeps your attention. When I watch the film now, I mostly watch it  for the scenes with Redford.  wow.  Does anyone else think Demi leaves with  the wrong man in this film?
B000002TQV|5.0|I just bought this CD a couple days ago after much deliberation over which of Radiohead's 3 albums to buy, and I cannot stop listening to it. This is  some of the most beautiful music, let alone rock music, I've heard. Great  music, great creative lyrics...there's nothing missing here. Thom Yorke has  an amazing, unique voice which he puts to good use and which blends  perfectly with the tone of the music. I suppose my favorite songs here are  High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, Bones, Just, and Black Star, but they're  all very, very good. If you are unfamiliar with Radiohead, act quickly to  reverse this huge injustice to yourself. Buy this album, and if you have  any taste you will love it.
B00003Q43A|4.0|Good kicks evil's butt, planet gets saved and the good guys get the girls.  I liked this one in the theaters, I liked it on VHS, and I still like it  now that it's on DVD.  Formulaic, maybe, but it's a formula that's worked  since Moses let the Exodus.
0790729628|5.0|First off I'd like to say I love Blade Runner; both versions, but I still think Director's cut is much better ( deeper, more atmosphere, mystic ).  The movie, overally, is a sci-fi masterpiece, one of the bestest, without  doubt. The dark atmosphere makes the movie so enjoyable, and quite sad  thou', because it shows masterfully the human emotions; and androids, and  what the future could be. Dark, dirty, clouded, wasted...<br />So to the  story. It tells a story of a retired Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, who is  chosen back to his job; to take another droid-hunt. ( This is not action  -movie, so I thought, but I wasn't disappointed; this is better like it is  ) So he takes the job, and you'll see what happens. The story is multiple,  and hard to understand at first ( maybe easier for those who have readed  the book ), but it makes it re-watchable. I've seen it many many times, and  I'm going to see it many times to come.<br />&quot;...what is life?... it  vanishes like tears in rain...&quot;
6305858764|3.0|I like good psychodramas, and this is one of the few I've seen that's even remotely accurate in the psychological aspect.  Beyond that, I thought it  was a very well done film.  I will admit, I'm not a big Paltrow fan--but  Jude Law, especially, was fantastic.
B000002IQW|3.0|The boys of Skid row headed back to the studio to record &quot;slave the the grind&quot;, after their plantinum selling self titled debut. Upon its  release, it rocketed to #1 on the bilboard charts. The first time I heard  the cd, I  didn't much care for the exceedingly long songs. I was looking  for another &quot;here I am&quot; or &quot;Youth gone wild&quot;. however  it wasn't here. There are some good all out rock songs here.  &quot;Mudkicker&quot;, &quot;Riot act&quot; and &quot;Creepshow&quot; are  all top rate.  I personally loved &quot;Quicksand Jesus&quot; and  &quot;Wasted Time&quot;  Overall, I score it 3 stars, its a good listen,  but not nearly as addicting as the debut.

B00004SCX6|1.0|How does she actually get away with calling herself a singer? She should be a dancer for someone else... Her voice is annoying, she sounds like a  goat, in the song oops...i did it again  you can really hear the goat  quality.  Britney is a total product....Im starting to believe their is a  factory somewhere that makes blonde teen pop singers and boy bands.  <br />In  the studio they make Britney's voice sound stronger and &quot;bigger&quot;  so we know she must be terrible in real life.  Anyone who's seen her  concerts on TV or live should be able to tell that.  <br />Her cd is  terrible....this is supposed to be Britney grown-up?  Oh yeah, a grown  woman's life consists of nothing but puppy love and &quot;playing with  guy's hearts&quot; Her cover of &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is shameful...I  dont even know Britney and I feel bad for her....she ruined the song.  Overall, this is a terrible CD by a wannabe celine dion who has the vocal  range of a moose on drugs.
B0000029DD|5.0|when i bought this album, i fell madly in love with jeff buckley.  i put  the cd in my cd player and listened to it every day for a year.  it never  wore out, and i never got tired of listening to his goregous voice, soulful  lyrics, and lush compositions.
B000002ADT|5.0|This recording strikes a beautiful balance rarely achieved in art, or in life, in general for that matter.  It's tempo is such that it can serve as  background, yet it is sufficiently engaging to be the subject of focused  attention. It is modern yet classic. Consequently, it sounds familiar yet  fresh no matter how often one hears it. The solo performances in the music  are eloquent, yet the collective result is strikingly beautiful as a whole.  One has the feeling this music is not played to you, but for you. It's  emotional content has a universality recongnizeable to those who live fully  and deeply.  It is no wonder this jazz recording has sold more than any  other.<br />Another recording that includes two of the principals from 'Kind  of Blue' , including Miles, and that achieves a similar arc of beauty,  depth and feeling is 'Somethin' Else' by Cannonball Adderley.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Well, I bought this CD for my daughter, and she shares the same thoughts about it that I do. The CD is indeed worse than her debut album. The song  Oops I Did It Again was OK the first time I heard it, but radio stations  over-play it. I'm getting so tired of hearing it on the radio at home, in  the mall, and everywhere else. The spoken messages are very annoying, and I  don't see why Britney put them in. The copy of the Rolling Stones song  Satisfaction is a very poor reproduction. If you want REAL pop music, buy  Christina Aguilera's, Mandy Moore's or Jessica Simpson's album.
6304169558|5.0|Reading some of the reviews about this movie, I've noted that a lot of people believe that the only good part of the movie was the special  effects, and many believed that the plot was lacking.  I believe that the  special effects were great, but they were only an extra goody, and not the  best part of the package.<br />In the beginning of Twister, you are taken back  several years to the late sixties in the eastern part of the United States.   A father rushes through his country home, and his wife follows his lead  with their daughter, Joe, with them.  They hide in a backyard storm cellar,  but as the storm begins to pick up, they discover that the family dog is  not inside.  The father quickly ushers the dog inside, and shortly after he  recloses the door, the twister comes.  The father gets sucked into the  tornado, holding the door, while the mother and daughter are still safe  inside the cellar.<br />After this, the movie goes to the present, and a new  plot begins.  Joe's husband catches up with the storm chasers-also, his  former work companions-to have his wife sign the divorce papers so he could  get married to his new fiance, who he brings along.  But when trying to get  Joe to sign the papers, a tornado is found nearby, and the storm chasers  follow it to send up their newest project-Dorothy.  Dorothy is a machine  that both Joe and her husband designed, and when it comes in contact with a  twister, it will send up many sensors, enabling the storm chasers to get  readings on the tornado.  Their theory is if they can get readings on  tornados, and learn about them, they will be able to create better tornado  warnings, allowing people to get to safety more quickly before a tornado  hits.<br />Personally, I really liked this movie.  When I rented it awhile  back, I would just watch it over and over.  The plot is rather likeable,  and the characters are interesting and unique.  I recommend this movie to  the people reading this, not only for the special effects, but for the  whole package.
B000001XN2|5.0|This is one of the hottest live Opera sets in existence!  The principals don't sing they pour out molten streams of gold.  Von Karajan conducts with  sure-handed brilliance making the orchestra seem to speak for itself.  Simionato taunts us with solid, solid bravada, creamy and exclamatory in  her upper register, and theatrically dark in her lower depths.  Corelli's  lower voice is huge, and his high phrases are so great it's  incomprehensible that all this sound is coming from one person.  Price  tosses off phrases of exquisite smoldering beauty. Her upper register must  be heard to be believed, it's not just her floating stratospheric highs  that are fantastic but her fluid development of the arias.  In D'amor  sull'ali rosee she unfolds ream after ream of silken phrases, and then  launches the most vibrant, thrilling high note I have ever heard, and from  there wafts to a smoky low. Bastianini and Zaccaria fill out the furnace!  The sound is...good.
0783235607|5.0|It is amazing when you stop and think about it, that today, over 40 years after it has been done, Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;Psycho&quot; still remains  a fresh and harrowing movie-watching experience. This is the trend-setter  film, the one that got the so-called &quot;slasher genre&quot; going. Do I  need to write a synopsis of the movie here? No, not really, do I? Anyone  who is anyone would know what Psycho is about. What I still fail to  understand is, how come Alfred Hitchcock didn't get an Academy Award for  his fantastic directing? How come Bernard Herrmann didn't get one for his  spooky (and endlessly imitated, too) musical score? And especially, how  come Anthony Perkins didn't get one?<br />He could pass for a shy, stammering,  apparently nice young man in one scene, to a totally demented and crazy  man, with a glint of evil in his eye, in the next. Even though this film is  black and white, you can still see that glimmer of insanity in Norman's eye  in moments. He really lived the role beautifully. Despite it's age, this  film will never get old.<br />This, in my opinion(shared by many others, I  would presume) is the undisputed classic of the Master of Suspense, and a  must have for any classic film collector.
0140714154|4.0|Comedy, in the strictest sense, is concerned with ultimate forgiveness and reconciliation. In Shakespeare's play, &quot;The Tempest,&quot; the  protagonist, Prospero, must come to terms with his brother Antonio, who  conspired to have him driven from his duchy in Milan, and with the world of  social interaction in general.<br />Magic, Power, and Conspiracy are the  foundational thematic elements through which Shakespeare effects Prospero's  reintegration into human society. Thrown into a boat with his infant  daughter Miranda, Prospero comes to live on a nearly deserted island in the  Mediterranean Sea. Prospero's concentration on developing his proficiency  in Magic caused him to become alienated from his political and social  responsibilities in Milan, leading to his expulsion. His brother Antonio  conspired with Alonso, king of Naples, and seized the power Prospero  forsook for book-learning.<br />Prospero hears of a sea voyage undertaken by  his enemies, and, using his Magic, whips up a storm, a great tempest, which  causes his enemies to be shipwrecked on his island. On the island, Prospero  exercises total power - over the education of his daughter, his slave, the  deformed Caliban, and now over his enemies. He engages Ariel, a sprite, to  orchestrate the division of the traveling party, and to put them through  various trials to exact vengeance and ultimately, submission from them.<br />&quot;The Tempest&quot; is a fine effort from Shakespeare, but the power  relations in the play are problematic. Prospero's insistent dominance over  the action of the play is extremely troubling. Although he is presented as  a benevolent character, Prospero's relationships with Miranda, Caliban, and  Ferdinand, King Alonso's son, complicate his overall worth as a man and an  authority figure. The dynamic between the slave Caliban and the drunks,  Trinculo and Stephano, is also very unsettling.<br />Overall, &quot;The  Tempest&quot; remains a whimsical flight of imagination, while exploring  intriguing themes of education, political intrigue, and romance. Certainly,  it is still a well-constructed and entertaining play after nearly four  hundred years.on, while exploring  intriguing themes of education, political intrigue, and romance.

0671034065|1.0|I have enjoyed Linda Howard's previous books, but this one was not up to her usual standards.  The plot involving this list becoming national news  was ludicrous to begin with.  The sexual relationship between the main  characters was offensive and ridiculous.  If the sexual encounters had been  eliminated, there would hardly have been any pages in the book.  I'm sorry  I'm paid for a hardback book of such poor standards.
0790734443|3.0|When Michael Keaton and Tim Burton had had enough of the Batman franchise  after two excellent films, Val Kilmer and Joel Schumacher stepped in to  make Batman Forever, a far cry from the first two films being a more  colorful, comic book-type adventure.    To start with acting, Val Kilmer is  good as the new Batman/Bruce Wayne, and Chris O' Donnell is okay as Robin,  though I could have  gone another film without Robin for certain.  Nicole  Kidman is also okay as Dr. Chase Meridian, a psychologist who wants to know  what makes Batman tick.  As for the villains, Tommy Lee Jones plays his  part very well as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the script makes him closer to  the Joker, taking away the toughness and gruff from the animated series'  Two-Face.  Jim Carrey goes overboard as Edward Nygma/The Riddler,  Two-Face's partner in crime. Though he is very amusing too watch, he needs  to have a bit more intelligence, cool, and confidence. It is also very  funny to watch these two colorful criminals work to conquer Gotham with a  brain-draining device and destroy Batman. <br />Barbara Ling's production  design is very good, especially at Claw Island yet Gotham City is too  bright and neon colored to give the sense and and look of darkness and awe  that the original and second Gotham City had.  John Dykstra's (Star Wars,  Star Trek-The Motion Picture) visual effects are excellent, once again  primarily at Claw Island.  Dennis Virkler's (The Hunt For Red October, The  Fugitive) film editing is also well-done.  Oscar nominations for Best  Cinematography, (Stephen Goldblatt-The Prince of Tides) Best Sound, (Donald  O. Mitchell, Frank A. Montano, Michael Herbick,-Under Siege, The Fugitive,  Clear and Present Danger and Peter Hliddal) and Best Sound Effects Editing  (Bruce Stambler and John Leveque-Under Siege, The Fugitive, Clear and  Present Danger, The Ghost and the Darkness).  No wins for Batman  Forever.<br />Despite some good action scenes (four slightly hokey yet  nonetheless entertaining scenes- the opening, Batman driving up a  skyscraper to escape Two-Face, the NygmaTech party crash, and the Wayne  Manor break-in), great new vehicles including a redesigned Batmobile, the  Bat Boat, the Bat Plane, and the Bat Sub, and plenty of new Bat hardware,  the movie is hurt badly by a very disappointing climax at Claw Island.   Though very lavish, the climax is dulled due to lack of fighting, not  enough light and too much GREEN lighting (you still can't see well enough).   A chilling yet funny ending at Arkham Asylum.  Overall, not as well-done  as the first two Batman films but is entertaining, lavish, and has a case  of overload.  I wished the next film would be more like the first two  but...... P.S.- 3 1/2 stars for Batman Forever.

B00000DHRZ|4.0|This was actually my first Offspring album I've heard, and since then I  was hooked up.  Of course, everybody knows 'Pretty Fly For A White Guy',  but it's by far not the best song on this album. It was more like a song to  draw the attention of the big crowd, and they succeeded in doing that.  The  album opens with an intro/disclaimer, but don't lay back! After the  disclaimer 'Have You Ever' kicks in! This fast song is about the feeling of  helplessness, the feeling that you don't actually control your own life.  There is a nice transition in this song. Another highlight is 'The Kids  Aren't Alright'. It is about the children living in one street growing up  and their lives end turn all wrong. The guitar-work by Noodles is superb.  'The End Of The Line' is about losing a person you love, and then having to  continue your life. You can feel the anger in this song. The next song is  'No Brakes', this is a fast and furious song with some excellent drum- and  guitar-play.<br />Americana is a good cd, with some excellent songs on it but  it is a bit more commercially orientated than previous albums. This is  album is somewhat more accessible to non-Offspring fans. Real  Offspring-fans may be a bit disappointed for this album is less  Offspring-like (take for example the song 'Why Don't You Get A Job?'), but  there are still enough real Offspring-songs to compensate for that.
B00003CWTH|5.0|The characters of this poingant film are each caught in their own  tradgedy, trapped and struggling to find meaning, to find resolution, even  to find life, and yet in the chaos of thier lives is an honesty, and an  inexplicaple beauty. From Meaninglessness and coincidence become themselves  a meaning. Paul Thomas Anderson has created a masterpiece. He uses fresh  tecniques to tell a complex set of stories about sorrow, cancer and  corruption, that instead of being depressing, is a life-affirming  expirience. The stories are dark, yes, but not without hope, and not  without humor. Many of actors adeptly portray fascinating characters, Tom  Cruise in particular is a suprise with a fresh new style. I can honestly  say, without reservation, that this is the best movie I have ever seen.  Watch Magnolia. Its an expirience.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|&quot;U-571&quot; is a fairly well thought out, well acted and scripted movie.  It's quite gripping and has plenty of action but also explores the  human side of submarines.  If you have seen the classic Wolfgang Petersen  film &quot;Das Boot,&quot; the based upon a true story of a German U-boat  in WWII during a war patrol and the trials and tribulations the crew  experiences while underway, you will more than likely enjoy  &quot;U-571.&quot;  Highly recommended, even if the historical points are  quite flawed.  On an up note, at the final credits, the director does give  credit where credit is due and names the submarines, both British and  American, that actually did capture the Enigma devices, which was a turning  point in the Atlantic battle against the German U-boat fleet.
B000003S0P|5.0|Godhead moments in music:  e.g., much of the late Beethoven string  quartets, 'Trane's melody and solo in the second section of A Love Supreme,  the first few minutes of Hendrix's solo in Machine Gun.  Another one can be  heard here, in the cut Providence, near the end, when the band, after 8 or  9 minutes of collective ruminating and cautious exploration, slams  full-force into that outrageous funk/metal groove from Neptune, everyone  soloing and backing the others at the same time, Fripp atop the mix, riding  some kind of huge sonic elephant, and it only lasts a minute or two, though  you want it to go on for at least a few days because **this** is God.  And  then, as soon as it had begun, it's done and Cross milks out a few  discordant parting lines and you're back among the profane.  But, for a  moment there...
B000000W5L|5.0|Placing this tape in my stereo for the first time, I listened to one of the great classics, Rocks Off, as it had been recorded in 1972.  After that  first listen, I definitely found enjoyment in the variety of other tracks  ranging from Tumbling Dice to Richard's Happy.  This is a great album, and  definitely one of their best from the seventies era.  The Rolling Stones  sound which erupts from this tape when played continues to carry the great  sensation as I experienced during my first listen.  That is the sign of a  great album.  If your a Stones fan I definitely recommend this one.
B000002GK1|5.0|The goal of every musician is to create, out of the zillions of moments of sounds he or she might make in a career, at least one or two that are  GODHEAD.  Cornell's vocal in _Slaves and Bulldozers_, along w/Thayil's solo  in the same song are Soundgarden's moments of GODHEAD.  Even if the rest of  the CD were complete crap (which, incidentally, it isn't), you should buy  the thing for those few moments alone.  They encapsulate everything that  matters about heavy music.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Yes she did it again, and even better this time. This is flat out gret pop music. I really like every song on the album, especially tracks  1,2,5,6,7,9,10 &amp; 12, and that's almost The whole album! This is a must  for any pop fan.
0783240287|5.0|I'd be happy if every DVD would be that good. Here everything seems perfect. The soung is good and you get Dolby Digital 5.1 beside a DTS track  (pretty rare combination). The cast, play and performance is excellent. The  whole design of the screen version is also kinda cute.  Every performer  seems to enjoy the play as well as everyone. Then on top you even get extra  stuff, a good werkfilm almost an hour long. <br />I have like 50 DVDs, and  this is the first to get my whole family attracted. Even my wife, and that  is really something. :-)
B00004U30D|3.0|This story is told from the perspective of a just-murdered man who had turned his life around before he died.  Frankly, I think this plot device  was too contrived.  I wish I could have just seen the story unfold  naturally.  But there was nothing natural anyway about this movie.<br />It was  all stereotypes exaggerated to a degree that made them comical. Throw in  irreverent humor, some bold language and universal truths.<br />The movie is a  success because the audience relates to it.  Kevin Spacey is  &quot;everyman&quot; just trying to be happy.  And so he quits his job,  lusts after his teenage daughter's friend, tells off his wife, smokes pot,  plays his favorite music and achieves the kind of success that evoke  cheers.<br />The acting is good.  Casting is fine.  But as far as I'm  concerned, the story just didn't make it and I had to force myself to stay  interested in the characters.  I also didn't like the cinematography,  especially the dream sequences or the grainy images of videotaping which  the daughter's boyfriend, a weird but yet sympathetic character played by  Wes Bently, was obsessed with taping.<br />Maybe it was all the hype that  turned me off.  Maybe it was just that I was bored.  And maybe because I  just felt so sad at the end of the picture, that I just can't think of it  as entertainment.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I only gave her one star because &quot;0&quot; is not an option...damn! The girl can't sing and that's it plain and simple. Her voice is weak and  it's horribly blended in with electronic instruments. The background  singers have more pitch and power than she does. Perhaps that's why you can  hear them more so than her. She sells records because the little kiddies  like her and she's a good looking young woman with a nice body....so why  isn't she a model instead? Her songs sound all the exact same, her  &quot;owww's&quot; and &quot;ah's&quot; and those other monotonous moans  and groans are forced and over rehearsed and her dancing is the exact same.  It appears that these days when artists attract flocks of young  teens....it's merely for the image and not the talent, because there is  absolutely positively none with Britney Spears. She's a commercial  marketers dream...but when the time is up and the dream is over....so her  career will be also. I think the ultimate goal of a true musician is to  show diversity in your voice and songs and to be appreciated for your  talents and remembered for your voice.....this is NOT going to happen. In  2-5 years she'll be featured in the People Magazine special issue of  &quot;Where Are They Now&quot;.

0393307050|5.0|When you start reading the first book in any series of novels, you always  have to make a decision at some point as to whether or not you will  continue to read the next book(s).  For me, the decision to continue with  the series came very early, probably in the first 50 pages.  O'Brian paints  a wonderful picture of Captain Aubrey, a very interesting and colorful  commander, his new friend and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, and the rest  of the crew of the Sophie.  Let me say that going into the book, I had very  little knowledge of the Napoleonic era, ships, or the sea.  I really didn't  think that I would enjoy the book, but I was wrong.  I was fascinated with  every aspect of the book.  The characters, the atmosphere, the action...all  of the book is first-rate.  I'm glad I've got 19 more books in the series  left to enjoy, but I'm afraid the pages will turn all too quickly.

0780020693|1.0|Criterion usually sticks with the classics so I was really looking forward to viewing this movie, Amarcord.<br />Boy, what a bad movie.<br />I can deal with  plotless, &quot;slice of life&quot; movies such as Nashville but this one  is just Italian trash. More flatulence jokes than you will find in a comedy  for children. Every woman is treated either as a slave or as a sex object.  This film does not belong in the Criterion collection nor does it deserve  it's reputation as a classic. Finishing watching this movie was like  reading a school textbook cover-to-cover for fun.
0767849493|5.0|I rented this movie by accident ome night, I'd never even heard of it. The best thing to say about it is that it kicked ass, plain and simple. It is  very, very amusing, the acting is great, and the story itself is extremely  clever. Jay and Bob are the bomb together. An awesome movie, no doubt!
B00004XPP0|5.0|If someone asked me what my favorite movies were, I would have to say STAR WARS, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, RETURN OF THE JEDI. The special editions are  real gems, {my favorite versions} and I am so glad that George Lucas is  also releasing the trilogy in special widescreen versions, because you  wouldn`t believe what your missing by not seeing the movies in widescreen.  For example when Luke is observing the sand peoples bantha`s Luke says  &quot;whell there are two bantha`s down there but I dont see any... wait  second there sand peoplke all right I can see one of them now.&quot; In the  widescreen version you will see that sand person through Lukes binaculars,  but in the non-widescreen version {pan &amp; scan} you will not see the  sand person. Not a big deal to some, but theres more although I don`t want  to go into it. All I can say is if you willing to see those black bars at  the top and bottom of you`r t.v buy the widescreen versions. George Lucas  is always hoping that the public will hopefully see the movies in there  best possible format, widescreen is the way to see them. PS If you haven`t  seen the movies in widescreen I don you where you been.

B000009CEM|4.0|This one's a cool one,though it looks like a science-fiction story more than a metal album..But it really rocks! Especially the first 'Shock' gets  u ready and heats u up for the journey in future.The second  one,'Edgecrusher' sounds like a remix of a hard  core song.It's probably  the best song in the album..It's worth payin..but not a classic,be sure!
0440213525|2.0|Perhaps this will be more a review of Grisham as a writer than of the book itself, as The Client was my first (and last) foray into Grishamland.  <br />First, I am by no means an academic.  I have never thought much of high brow literary professors waxing philosophic over some irrelevant book in their irrelevant university offices.  But when it comes to The Client, what can I do other than to sound like a literary snob?  This was one of the most dreadfully written books I have ever read ...  I understand that one reads Grisham not for mental stimulation, but for escape.  Fair enough.  That doesn't mean that the escape literature that one reads to kill time on a plane or in the doctor's office can't be well written.  Case in point, how many people are enjoying the escape offered to them by the Harry Potter books, books that are brilliantly written despite offering &quot;escape elements&quot; to their readers?  The Client contains no exciting plot twists, no quality threading and weaving of plot circumstances, and a lot of plain old insulting &quot;tell&quot; rather than &quot;show&quot; that even a first grader knows to keep out of his/her writing.  Everything in this book is in your face, and as a reader I find myself completely insulted.  <br />Regarding the plot, how am I supposed to root for a kid who, with the help of his lawyer, is doing everything in his power to hide information leading to the conviction of a sleazeball who has killed an innocent man?  Even if I fear for poor young Mark, I uh, dunno, kinda sorta sympathize with the innocent dead guy and his family.  <br />The characters are simply dreadful.  With perhaps the sole exception of Mama Love, is there a single likeable or sympathetic character in the whole book?  Mark is an absolute brat. Reggie, despite her occasional compassion, is crass and rude to almost anyone that gets in her way, and Harry Roosevelt is a tyrant who rules his courtroom the way Stalin ruled Russia.  All of Grisham's characters, big and small, are just plain unfriendly people, making the excitement of a good vs. evil plot theme impossible, because there isn't any good here.  If in fact Grisham does want to make everyone a scoundrel, he should at least make them compelling scoundrels.  Note : Darth Vader, Potter's Lord Voldemort, and the enticing Jules Winnfield (and his &quot;biblical death speeches&quot;) of Pulp Fiction. Grisham's &quot;bad guys&quot; are as dull as any group of characters I have ever met. <br />I must call a spade a spade : John Grisham can not write to save his life, not in this book anyway, and it's a shame that there are so many great writers out there just dying to be heard, while this guy manages to get [nonsense] like this sold by the millions.  I gave The Client two stars because to me, one star connotes something that is just plain incomprehensible, and I was at least able to follow this pitiful little story.  I am one of the unfortunate ones who refuses to stop reading a book once I've started it for fear I will have missed something.  This book made me think twice about maintaining that policy.  <br />I realize I may offend Grisham fans with what I write here, but I think I make a fair case, and if I can prevent even one person like myself from reading this piece of junk then I will be happy.  There are plenty of other well written &quot;escape books&quot; out there.  The Client is a novel that should be avoided at all costs.
0780020685|5.0|Akira Kurosawa is among the top 5 film directors of all time. &quot;The Seven Samura&quot; is generally accepted as his masterpiece. <br />Everything  from the beautiful cinematography to the enthralling story makes it  impossible to turn this DVD off. The commentary by Michael Jeck is worth an  immediate reviewing of the film. How many other DVD commentaries are worth  watching the film a second time? It's without question the most  enlightening and entertaining commentary on any DVD I've ever  experienced.<br />By the time this movie is over you will consider each of the  Samurai a good friend and you will feel their victories and their defeats.  Toshiro Mifune is clearly one of the greatest screen actors of all time.  Also excellent is Takashi Shimura as the head samurai. Both of these actors  perform their best work here. If you have a DVD player and do not own this  disc, shame on you.
0553573403|5.0|This book has been recommended to me so many times, but I have held off  because the series is not over.  I have finally relented and read it and I  am so glad I did.  This is truly not just one of the best Fantasy novels  I've ever read, it is one of the best of all genres.  I have never raged or  cheered so much at a book before.  Never has an author inspired such hate  in me towards a character in a book, while inspiring joy and even pride in  other characters.  The plot twists and turns like a roller coaster but  believe me, Martin straps you in tight, and he never loses you.  Almost  everyone reviewing this book has given it 5 stars.  The few that have given  it less have been for the same reasons.  Yes, this book is dark, people  die, people get betrayed.  Guess what? That is what happens in real life.  If you like fantasy because you like to read of elves dancing in sun  dappled glades while unicorns frolic with fairies, then you will not like  this.  If you like the standard fare of stable-boy is told by old man of  his true past and the dark one who must be stopped and goes on a quest for  a sword and none of the good guys die,  again you will not like this.  However, if you like a plot that will leave you with no more fingernails,  characters that will make you weep and rage and laugh and smile, and just  plain great storytelling, this is definitely for you.

B00000099Y|5.0|The first Tool album I bought was 'Undertow'.  I was pretty impressed but I wasn't in awe.  It took me nearly 6 months to get around to buy 'Aenima'.   This is singlehandedly my favorite album of all time.  Where 'Undertow'  was just an excellent alt-rock album, 'Aenima' is in a class of it's own.   It's epic, it's brilliant.  The lyrics are incredibly deep and beautiful.   The music is incredibly powerful and goes straight to your head.  Maynard's  voice is too good to be true.  I think Tool gets a bad rep because they are  usually grouped with all these lame nu-metal bands.  If you've passed up  this incredible band because of their fanbase, you're missing out.  The  lyrics are very ambiguous but the personal interpretations you can get out  of them could change your life.  Please do yourself a favor and buy one of  the best albums of the 90's if not one of the best albums ever.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Having only just discovered Moby as an artist, I can definately conclude that my head has been filled with recycled pop chart tracks that will be  forgotton in years to come.  Moby is here to stay and this ablum proves it.  This is definately one of the sexiest, brilliant albums of the year, a  winner as background music, bedroom music and discman music.  Moby makes me  feel like I am in an exotic country and moving in slow-motion, it makes you  stop and take a closer look. Funky tracks like Honey, Body Rock and Machete  will provide that extra edge to each footstep and make you want to move  your body in ways you never imagined.   My personal favourites are the  mellow spiritual tracks which reach deep within: Natural Blues, My  weakness, Inside and of course, the subliminal Porcelain which is possibly  the best thing about the film, &quot;The Beach&quot;. Every song on this  album has significance for me and that is what Moby is all about: he allows  his listeners to use his music to express themselves and understand what  they are all about.<br />I just know one day It will be a scorching day and I  will jump into the clear waters of the beach and feel the bubbles running  over my skin, and my blood tingling beneath it.  When I resurface, the  feeling will be indescribable, but I will be able to say: &quot;It's just  like that Moby song, &quot;Porcelain&quot;&quot;.......
B00000JPHF|5.0|Having seen nearly all of the Universal horror films, most of which are great fun, this one is my favorite.  More tragedy than horror, with a  lyrical flair and a singular performance by Karloff. Only portions of the  supporting cast disappoint, but they thankfully are not onscreen too long.
B0000024SI|5.0|I may be considered a minor among Dylan fans because of the songs which triumph in my mind.  Still, I have many reasons why this record is truly a  masterpiece. Doubters, understand this: you may not like Dylan's voice, you  may not appreciate his music, but these are not the places he excels.   Dylan's true brilliance is shown through one very important aspect of  music: the lyrics.  Not one person on all earth can write lyrics like he  can.  From the 'how does it feel   to be on your own   without a home    like a complete unknown    like a rolling stone' of the 60's radio hit Like  A Rolling Stone, which is what all adults feel when they leave home, to  Highway 61 Revisited's 'God said to Abraham, kill me a son   Abe said man,  you must be putting me on   God said no, Abe said what, God said, you can  do what you want Abe, but   the next time you see me coming you'd better  run   Abe said 'where do you want this killing done'   and God said, out on  highway 61', which is so inspired and absurd that it is amazing, Dylan  shows that rock does not need to be 'ooooooooo, i want to hold your hand.'  Still, neither of these are the masterpieces of this record.  This title  belongs to the final track on the album: Desolation Row.  This song has  good vocals, good music, and AMAZING lyrics.  The words to this song truly  represent Dylan.  From 'they're selling postcards of the hanging   they're  painting the passports brown   the beauty parlor is filled with sailors    the circus is in town' to 'right now i can't read to good   don't sent me  no more letters no   not unless you mail them from   Desolation Row', this  song has beautiful lyrical ideas.  Even if one does not like Dylan, this  album is so amazing that it is worth buying by anyone.
630281474X|5.0|This is the best version of Dracula. I've seen all the Dracula movies, and none come closer to Bram Stoker's original Dracula novel than this movie. <br />Dracula was not to be pitied, not to be understood in the human sense, he was a demonic killer. A soul-eater. Those that came under his influence were like cattle to him. And so far, this is the only film that has ever stayed true to Stoker's original story (including the so-called Bram Stoker's Dracula by Copalla). <br />Christopher Lee is at once evil, arrogant, and stately. Peter Cushing became an instant hero of mine from the first time I saw this picture on the Acre Creature Feature midnight movie when I was about nine. He infused the character of Van Helsing with an athletic energy that explodes off the screen in the final killing-scene of Dracula.  The photography is beautiful, the direction by Terrance Fisher perfect, and the performance by all Hammer regulars is top notch.<br />Isn't it about time this superior film was moved from video to DVD, in it's original aspect ratio, and it's original British release? Let's hope Warner Brothers gets on the ball on this one!
0767903854|5.0|Having read Bryson's article on Sydney in the September National Geographic, I was enthralled by the subject matter and writing. I  immediately bought this book and was not disappointed. One of the best  books I've read in awhile. Bryson's dry wit, descriptions of this most  fascinating country and historical background are  rewarding and enjoyable  to read. I have always been intrigued by Australia and after In A Sunburned  Country feel that I have learned a great deal while having a lot of fun  doing so. I have now joined the legion of Brysonites and have just picked  up A Walk In The Woods. I welcome other suggestions from the Bryson fans -  please email them to me at JRapson@aol.com. Thanks
B000002U82|5.0|a timeless album that defines what p.f. is all about. My personal favorite song is &quot;the great gig in the sky&quot;. This album's music transends  time and is &quot;discovered&quot; by each generation to come. And, even  though every song could easily stand alone, the whole is far greater than  the sum of its parts. I recommmend this album to anyone from generation X  to baby boomers. Enjoy  !
B00003CWTI|1.0|Y'know how they've been talking about inventing special boxesfor your computer that would allow people to transmit odors over the Internet? Well, if I had one and I wanted to test it out on this page, the stink would drive me from the room...Yeah, people say the performances were good, but the whole time you're watching it, you're aware of the acting. News flash: Good acting is submerging yourself in the character, not showing off your chops.  You're also painfully aware of the director and his pompousness. P.T., you're not Kubrick--you're not even Corman,..--so stop trying to impress us. Same goes for your girlfriend.  END

B00004U8PA|4.0|I'm sure anyone who has ever heard of Rocky Horror has heard about it's strange cult following.  Why, you ask?  The Rocky Horror Picture Show is  truly one of a kind.  I have seen the movie at least twenty times in my  lifetime (that's not a lot, compared to true fans), and surprisingly, it  has never once bored me.  Upon one viewing, I decided that I was too tired  to really watch, so I was going to fast forward through parts of it.  By  the first song, &quot;Science Fiction Double Feature&quot;, with those big,  red lips up on the screen, I was hooked.  The songs are very catchy, with  funny lyrics that will stay in your head for weeks to come (a mixed  blessing to some).  Tim Curry gives his all as Frank-n-Furter, a  scientist from another planet who has strange parties in the middle of the  night.  This part showcases his great voice, and his over-the-top acting.  Also recommended for fans of Susan Sarandon.  This is one of her earlier  works, and you can tell that to this day, she is a little embarassed about  it.  If for nothing else than a pop culture reference, The Rocky  Horror Picture Show is a must-see.  Obviously, some people will not like  this film, but it's their loss.
158234082X|4.0|I borrowed this book from a friend who loved it and so did I.  Of course,  you need to actually POSSESS a sense of humor to enjoy it.  I especially  loved the chapter about his entire day.  Anthony writes from the hip.  He  tells it like it happened. It's HIS story.  I applaud his culinary efforts  and I learned things from this book.  I was in the kitchen with him when  the shipment was late.  I could see the sweat dripping from his brow during  the dinner rush.  I was at that table in Japan watching him drown himself  in sushi.  Anyone that can transport a reader across an ocean has done  something truly reat.  However, he did not make me want to be a  professional cook, and I'd never want to marry the guy, but it was an  enjoyable, frenzied ride.  Sure he's arrogant and cocky, but he's got  cohones.  That's so refreshing in these times of nauseating political  correctness.  Lighten up, people!!<br />P.S.  Everyone who lambasted Anthony  for his few typos better take another look their own reviews before they  open their big mouths again.

0440234743|2.0|The Testament starts out very well, with an excellent idea: an old man,  disgruntled with his children, makes a will giving his 11 billion to a  illegitimate child who lives in the jungle.  The lawyers for the children  of the recently deceased all fight to get money out of the will.   Meanwhile, Nate O'Riley goes into the jungle of South America.   Unfortunately, I like the law more than I like escapades into the jungle.   It just took too long in the middle of the book to keep me interested in  the law part.  I grade books by how long it takes me to read them and be  interested: this one took me 5 days.  Every other grisham i have read took  me 1.  I think this is his worst novel, but he made a strong comeback with  The Brethren.
0140441409|4.0|Marcus Aurelius`s Meditations is truly a great work of philosophy.    Marcus was a Roman Emperor in the late second century.  He wrote this gem  not to be published but as a dairy to help pass the time when he was  campaigning against the Germans on the northern border.  Raised as nobility  he had many famous teachers among them were the stoic philosophers of his  time.  <br />The stoic philosophy was very popular with the higher classes of  Roman society.  It had some parallels to the writings of Mencius.   Both  preach a very rigid social structure and that everyone should be content  with his/her station in life, whether slave or emperor or poet or garbage  collector, a trait that we in America have problems relating to.  But it  also preached that the individual should always do his best in any job that  he does and to face all problems with courage and fortitude.<br />I find  reading Marcus's Meditations very inspiring.   I am amazed at how some of  his ideas I take to heart while others I find their concept hard to accept.   No matter what religion you are or what philosophy you follow you will  find that some if not all of Marcus's words have wisdom in them.  After all  wisdom is where you find it.  A sign of a great book is that it is as  inspiring thousands of years later as it was the day it was written and  Marcus Aurelius's Meditations definitely fulfils this requirement.  I would  highly recommend this book to anyone.
0790731479|5.0|This is such a great film, I don't even know how to sum it up. First of  all, it is completely original and it is unlike any film I have ever seen  before. Second of all, it's a great comedy with kind of a spooky, weird  feel to it, which is something all of Tim Burton's films have. The look of  the film is probably what I like the best. Art Director Bo Welch and Tim  Burton show us a world unlike anything seen in a movie.  This is a great  film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable,  entertaining film that is original and inventive.
B000001FN3|4.0|This album deservedly got a lot of attention when it first came out -- in the UK, tracks were even played on the BBC's classical station, Radio  Three, on the late Derek Jewell's 'Sounds Interesting' programme.  Alan  Parson's main claim to fame before then had been his outstanding  contribution to Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' -- you only need to listen  to any CD version of that to appreciate its clarity.<br />Unlike his  subsequent ventures where there was clearly a core band, for this album  Parsons used a variety of artists for each track.  Arthur Brown, late of  'Fire' and the magnificent Kingdom Come, was still trying to find a role  for himself, with appearances on this, 'Captain Lockheed' and Ken Russell's  film 'Tommy'.  John Miles was perhaps thinking himself a one-hit wonder  after his superb 'Music' single, but like Brown, he puts in a great  performance on this album.  Guitarist Ian Bairnson was the biggest  revelation on this album, because previously he had only been known for his  membership of Pilot, another one-hit wonder band ('Who-ho-ho It's Magic'),  which many suspected were teenyboppers.<br />The only problem with this album  is the orchestral piece, the Fall of the House of Usher, which dominates  side two of the original LP.  I have never understood why Alan Parsons  allowed Andrew Powell to write it, unless it was due to a lack of his own  material.<br />The CD version is a fantastic improvement over the original LP.  I cannot understand why Parsons cut out the Orson Welles intro from the  album.  It is so much better with it re-attached here, and for me, it  brings back memories of Welles's 70s ads for sherry (in the UK, anyway),  which were wonderfully parodied by Michael Palin in his first 'Ripping  Yarn' (now available on DVD, incidentally).  The instrumentation that  Parsons and Bairnson added specially for the CD are also improvements, in  my view.<br />So go ahead and enjoy this album.  And if you programme your  player to omit The Fall of the House of Usher, you won't be alone.he Fall of the House of Usher, you won't be alone.

0783240503|5.0|My family and I were so instantly impressed with the video of Joseph &amp; the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat that we immediately purchsed our own  copy! The concept of the opening with a classroom scene is great. Maria  Friedman and Donny Osmond (whom I had only vaguely remembered as some sort  of 70's teen idol) are fantastic. In fact it's impossible to imagine a  better cast at all. The Narrator, Jacob, Joseph, his brothers, their wives,  Pharoah (Pharoah is GREAT!) are wonderful. The show is bright with terrific  sets, great songs and a good story. A highlight is the way the cast are  shown at the end in their roles of hardworking downtrodden teachers! You  just have to watch this film!
B00003CX97|5.0|One of the best films ever made.  Very few war films before or since that have come close to River Kwai.  Kwai was one of the first films to show war  in a negative view.  I would not go as far as saying the film was anti-war,  it was more realistic about what war does to men then other films of its  day.  Alec Guinness gives a tremendous performance (worthy of Oscar he  received) as the British officer in charge off the POWs.  William Holden  gives one of best performances of his carrier as an American solder.  By  far my favorite film from Director David Lean
6305165912|5.0|Quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. The dialogue is incredibly smart and witty the whole way through, and the film is full of priceless  moments and characters. One of those movies where you find something new  every time you watch it. Buy this movie...you will be happy you did.
B00000JJQK|5.0|Pet Sounds was a milestone, so was Sgt. Pepper.  Both had equal influence  on music.  Its almost like debating the &quot;which came first, chicken or  the egg!&quot;  Its a great album which deserves its reputation as a  classic.   The songs are among the most emotional and sad you'll hear.   Wouldnt it Be Nice is probably one of the most brilliant and complex pop  songs ever written.  One thing that amazes me about this album, and Wilson  in general, is the abiltiy to shift to a completely different key and  chord/rhythm structure which is completely differnt from the rest of the  song, and make it seemless.  Listen to Wouldnt it be nice, Lets go away for  a while, and the itle track to see what i mean.  As far as the whole  Pepper/Pet Sounds thing, let me break it down like this, hopefully it will  end the pointless Pepepr vs. Pet Sounds debate:  Pepper was influnced by  Pet Sounds, which was influenced by Rubber Soul which was influenced by Bob  Dylan who was influenced by Woodie Guthrie.......you get the idea.  No one  album is better than the other and certainly no one particular album is  responsible for changing the face of music.  It was musical evolution.   And, if the truth be told: the first true concept album that most  historians consider to be the first concept album was not Pepper or Pet  Sounds, it was Frank Sinatra's &quot;In The Wee Small Hours&quot;.  So  please, listen to this great album and appreciate its importance in pop  music.  If its not your bag, fine.  If Pepper is your thing, fine.  Enjoy  them both or hate them, but dont come down on others who disagree with you.

Unfortunately, &quot;Hook&quot; falls into the trap of that age old cliche:  good idea, horrible execution.  &quot;Hook&quot; assaults the viewer with  some of the most heavy handed, manipulative scenes and dialogue ever put to  film.  In every scene Speilberg's less than skillful direction and John  Williams' overblown score seem to scream out, &quot;THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE  MOVING!;&quot; but they only succeed in making everything seem contrived  and phony.  This movie is so sacchrine that it will make your teeth ache.   Robin Williams once again hams it up, and Speilberg does little to restrain  him much to detriment of the movie.  The Lost Boys, with their oh-so-early  90's hipness, get lamer and lamer as the years go by and they were pretty  lame back when &quot;Hook&quot; was first released.  The sets are  overstylized and silly- Hook's pirate ship doesn't look that it could even  float let alone sail.  Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell?  The less said about  her the better.<br />I did enjoy the performances of Dustin Hoffman and Bob  Hoskins.  Also it is fun to see a very young Gwenyth Paltrow in a bit part  as a young Wendy.  However, those are the only positives that I can see in  this wretched piece of candy corn.<br />I know people do not think negative  reviews are helpful; but I can't help stating that &quot;Hook&quot; is  Speilberg's worst movie.  (Yes, even worse than &quot;1941!&quot;)  It's  hard to believe that the same man who made me jump out of my seat with  &quot;Jaws,&quot; thrilled me with &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot;  shocked and moved me with &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; and left me  breathless with &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; is responsible for  &quot;Hook.&quot;  &quot;Hook&quot; is a movie that insulted my  intelligence and made me cringe throughout its interminable length.
6305350205|5.0|This film was doomed with critics and semi-trekkers the moment it was revealed that Shatner would direct. The knives hit the sharpening stones  before the film was even released. I don't think anyone reasonably doubts  that. Is it the best Trek film, no. That honor almost certainly goes to  Wrath of Khan. Is it the worst? Oh please. The fact that the insipid and  childish IV consistantly receives high marks actually frightens me. The  Search for Spock wasn't bad but certainly mediocre. And the Undiscovered  Country? Yeesh. I don't suppose I can rightfully comment on a film I walked  out on. I can only handle so much sanctimonious hippie-blather in one  sitting. Generations....Wow,see what I mean? Part V wasn't as bad as you  thought was it? V was flawed, to be sure, but it was certainly the best  attempt at filming one of the more cerebral scripts since the series. At  least there was an effort to plot something more challenging than  ..&quot;Save Spock!&quot;..or &quot;Save Whales!&quot;.  The film also was  by far the most &quot;cinematic&quot; of the bunch. On the wide screen  there are some very beautiful epic shots, part V looked considerably more  like an epic, widescreen film than any of the others. I think Shatner, or  at least his cinematographer, did a beautiful job of creating an epic sweep  to some of the scenes. Especially compared to the cheap and obvious  planet-side sets of part III. I think people are going to re-think this  film after awhile...especially after a few more of the god-awful &quot;Next  Gen&quot; movies.
6305657947|5.0|I have watched this movie 20 times, and still take pleasure from the script, the actors, and scenes. Each time I watch this movie, I realize how  Thomas Crown has predicted her every move, and has in place two options. If  she takes option A, he wins, and if she takes option B, he wins. The net  result is that he wins her, a female who loves the chase, and loves to win  by catching the criminal.<br />In this version of the Thomas Crown Affiar, he  wins her, and at the same time defeats her every move, thus gaining her  respect and her love for what he can create, based on circumstances.<br />The  movie takes me to a place where money is no object, only the game, and the  results, are what push the male ego one step ahead of the the Female.  <br />This is the best movie that I have ever watched on DVD and would  recommend it to any true romantic that loves what money can buy.<br />If only  I could be Thomas Crown!
B00001ZULV|5.0|For slick pop/rock filled to the rim with catchy hooks and spotless  production, few bands hit the mark with more consistency than Genesis.   Phil Collins' distinctive, soulful vocals are always a treat, and the  group's songwriting has kept a consistently high quality over the decades,  as this compilation of their hits demonstrates.<br />It's hard to believe that  decades have passed since the release of tracks like &quot;Turn it On  Again,&quot; &quot;Misunderstanding,&quot; and &quot;That's All,&quot; all  timeless pop songs that sound just as fresh today.  &quot;In Too Deep&quot;  and &quot;Hold on My Heart&quot; are still drop-dead gorgeous ballads sung  with genuine romantic longing, &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; remains a  powerful political statement, and &quot;I Can't Dance&quot; continues to  entertain as a trippy sonic adventure.  And if &quot;Abacab&quot; or  &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; date themselves with the technology level of  synthesizers from their respective periods, the timeless, irresistible  hooks come to the rescue.<br />For those of us who preferred the more  commercial incarnation of the band as compared to the arty Peter Gabriel  period, the inclusion of &quot;I Know What I Like in Your Wardrobe&quot;  and &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; and the neglect of &quot;No Reply at  All&quot; will be a bit frustrating.  Still, with this many well-written,  flawlessly executed pop songs at hand, any Genesis fan will find little to  complain about.  This is one compilation you'll want to turn on again...and  again.
B00000AF95|4.0|As much as some fans trash this album now, when it came out in 1984 it  returned KISS to the top of the Rock/Metal world.  There's a simple reason  why: &quot;Heaven's On Fire.&quot;  One of the best songs KISS ever  recorded.  Catchy as hell, yet Heavy, &quot;HOF&quot; stands as a true KISS  Klassic!  On ANIMALIZE Paul Stanley continued to dabble in true Heavy Metal  (as he had for the previous two albums, CREATURES OF THE NIGHT, and LICK IT  UP) with two of KISS' best Metal songs in &quot;I've Had Enough,&quot; and  &quot;Under The Gun.&quot;  Eric Carr truly shines on those two tracks, as  you can hear how much energy the man had behind the drum kit!  Paul also  dabbled in David Lee Roth territory with &quot;Get All You Can Take,&quot;  another solid track.  Gene's songs, however, are not nearly as good.  &quot;Burn Bitch Burn,&quot; features his best riff since &quot;Calling Dr.  Love,&quot; but, unfortunately, has  NONE of that song's lyrical  tongue-in-cheek wit.  &quot;BBB&quot; may well have the dumbest lyrics Gene  has ever written - and that's saying a lot!  Gene also contributes two  songs that again define mediocre, &quot;Lonely Is The Hunter&quot; (fun to  play on guitar, not as much fun to listen to on the CD), and &quot;Murder  In High Heels.&quot;  One track from Gene that actually shows some spark  both musically and lyrically is &quot;While The City Sleeps.&quot;  It is  his lone inspired track on the album.  Overall, with it's Rock 'N' Metal  style, ANIMALIZE's highlights far outweigh the mediocre tracks, making it a  must-have for all KISS fans -and for most fans of 80's Metal in general.  --(and if you like this one, check out KISS' ASYLUM, Dokken's UNDER LOCK  AND KEY, and Alice Cooper's HEY STOOPID)
B00004XPP0|1.0|I have stopped counting the number of re-releases, re-re-releases and re-re-re-releases of the trilogy - and I can't help the feeling that this  is all about ripping me (the customer) off ... or should George Lucas be in  some kind of financial trouble, and that's why he keeps throwing slightly  altered editions on the market? I am already looking forward to the June  2001 re-release with an exclusive 3-minute interview on the planned  schedule for filming Episode III ...<br />I have always considered myself a  big Star Wars fan (excluding ridiculous Episode I), but somehow I am  getting fed up with this ... Thanks, George!
0395754100|4.0|I read Curious George to my 4 year old daughter before she goes to sleep at night. She enjoys the book and I concur with most of the praise in the  other reviews. But, I am critical of a point in this book.<br />The characters  in the book smoke. In one of the stories even George is smoking without  getting into trouble.<br />This book would have been much better, if the  smoking pictures were edited out.
6300270696|5.0|This movie was exceptional! When I first read the back of the video I didn't really want to watch it all. I watched it the first time trying hard  to find something wrong with it. The only thing that bugged me at all was  the music! Otherwise the acting and plot was superb! Michelle Phieffer was  gorgeous and &quot;The Mouse&quot; was just great! This so far is the best  fantasy movie I have ever seen!
B00004UEN8|5.0|The 1957 teaming of Pepper with what was then Miles Davis' rhythm section  - Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums  - was a brilliant idea.  This was the first time they had ever played  together, but you would never guess it.  With a fine selection of tunes and  masterful playing by all, this session swings with class.  While Pepper was  a consistently great player (on record) throughout his stop-and-start  career, he rarely had a backup team of this caliber.  Buy this disc today!
B00004VWA7|5.0|At long last, the stunning debut album by Jaco Pastorius gets the royal  treatment by the folks at Sony Legacy. Recorded in 1976 prior to joining  Weather Report, it's clear from the first bar that this man is serious  business!!! From the opening track, a cover of the Charlie Parker classic  &quot;Donna Lee&quot;(written by Miles Davis) featuring Jaco only  accompanied by a conga player to the final cut &quot;Forgotten  Love&quot;,it's very apparent that we're hearing something we've never  heard before. Pastorius took the bass from being a support instrument, to  front and center, without being tedious or overdone. Other highlights of  this album include &quot;Portrait of Tracy&quot;, and  &quot;Continuum&quot;.  &quot;Jaco Pastorius&quot; features excellent  support from the likes of Herbie Hancock, Hubert Laws, David Sanborn,  Michael  Brecker and Lenny White. This reissue also features two unreleased  tracks that were not part of the original LP. The booklet features rare  photos from the recording sessions and has great liner notes written by Pat  Metheny. The 24-bit remaster is a tremendous sonic improvement over the  original CD issue and the disc label even has the original orange Epic logo  on the disc. A first class reissue of a fusion jazz classic.
0345389409|2.0|I heard alot of things about this novel before I read it for myself (most were warnings about how boring it was), and unfortunately what I had heard  was true.  I love all of Anne Rice's vampire novels, and I still say all,  because this book is not one of them.  Sure Lestat is in this one, even my  beloved character Armand makes an appearance, but they seem to be there  only as a vehicle for the real story this book is telling &quot;Tales of  Heaven and Hell,&quot; or if you prefer &quot;Interview With the  Devil.&quot;  My advice SKIP it!   You don't need to read it to undrestand  the sixth vampire chronicle, &quot;The Vampire Armand.&quot;
B000003B6J|4.0|N.W.A-STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON Is a overall good cd if I would recomend any  N.W.A C.D it would be THE N.W.A LEGACY.<br />              R.I.P  ERIC&quot;EAZY-E&quot;WRIGHT
B00004RF9B|5.0|Don't know which is better The Day The Earth Stood Still or Forbidden Planet!Forbidden Planet special effect,electronic music score,and wide  screen give it the edge! Hard to buy any 50's Sci-fi afer watching the  best!
B00000J7JO|4.0|I've always kind of taken the Chili Peppers for granted. Liked some of what I heard on the radio but never enough to spend the cash for one of  their CDs. I borrowed this from a friend at work and have been playing it  non stop for 3 days.<br />Still funky, still hard, but with a depth of soul  and feeling and that wasn't apparent before. The creative sparks fly.  Flea's bass playing is as wicked as ever. John Fruscante is clearly  inspired by reuniting with his old mates. And Anthony's voice is stronger  and more dynamic than ever. He screams, he raps, he yells, he whispers.<br />A  really beautiful album with a burnished sadness to it. But NOT depressing.  It still rocks.
1567184855|1.0|Perhaps Dr. Newton's research and past-life regressions are legitimate,  but they do not closely follow any pattern established by other researchers  on past-life and near-death experiences (Moody, Fiore, and Whitton, for  instance), nor do they agree with Tibetan or other highly esteemed sources  on the experience after death.  To me, the entire volume has the flavor of  being created mostly from the imagination of Dr. Newton as a way of  supporting his far-flung theories.  If these indeed are regressions  reported by his subjects, I would guess that they have been influenced by  the hypnotist himself. This is not to say that some of these theories may  not coincide with other reports, but overall they do not have the ring of  truth.  Readers interested in reincarnation and the after-death experience  might look at Vickie Mackenzie's wonderful book on Lama Yeshe, or  Joel  Whitton's Life Between Life, or psychiatrist Brian Weiss' thoughtful books.  These researchers and reporters do not always agree, for this is  wide-open, new territory, but there are enough commonalities among them to  be extremely intriguing and informative.<br />Death and its aftermath is a  very important subject, for many traditions believe that the time of death  and beyond is a great opportunity for liberation and enlightenment of the  soul. Books such as The Grace in Dying and Facing Death and Finding Hope  elegantly address the path of the soul in the dying experience and the  after-death realms.  I hope that seekers after knowledge in this  fascinating arena explore other, better written and better documented  sources.  Unless you enjoy science fiction, spend your money wisely, and  elsewhere.
B000002V1D|5.0|I have been a fan of this group since 1983.  This has to be their best  effort.  Nick Rhodes is absolutely a GENIUS with the keyboards.  It seems  he is the only artist that really knows how to use his talent to compliment  the song as a whole.  If you listen to past albums, there is a definite  progression to this album.  Their earlier stuff sounds hollow compared to  this.  Their sound now is much more rich and mature (not that the early  stuff wasn't good... it was!)  EXCELLENT JOB FELLOWS!  Rhodes is really  showing off his abilities on this one.  Simon Le Bon's voice and lyrics are  absolutely hypnotic . . . as usual.  Warren continues to prove his talent  as a guitarist.  EVERY song on this CD is very solid and well done.  If  you've ever had any doubts about the talent of Duran Duran, buy this CD.   It will change your mind.  I don't think any band is capable of pulling off  such a broad range of styles like this one.  Too bad the critics are so  slow to get this concept.
B000021Y74|4.0|Many people have referred to 'Lola's' déjà vu narrative structure, and compared it with such films as Sliding Doors and Groundhog Day.  I give it  more credit than that (don't get me wrong - I love Groundhog Day!).  In  those cases the character was caught in the film's mystery, unable to break  the time-warp spell and get on with their lives.  Here, time breaks,  shifts, bends, and cracks for one simple reason: because Lola wills it so.   She wills herself a second chance to get Manni the money.  She wills the  spectacular (photo-captured) futures of the people she runs into on the  street.  She wills the money from her father.  And in the final sequence at  the casino, her will is put on it's most bare, full-throated display.   Rarely have I been more satisfied with a cliched ending; it had to be that  way, because that's what Lola wanted (and whatever Lola wants, Lola gets!   Omigod!  Is it all just a thinly veiled 'Damn Yankees' reference?)<br />It  borrows its schizophrenic style from 'Natural Born Killers', utilizing  video, film, and cartoon, quick editing, disturbed camera angles, and even  an oppressive musical soundtrack.  I'm still trying to decide if the style  added or subtracted from the narrative.  I enjoyed the cartoon; thought it  was perfectly edited; and never felt like I was watching the same scene  over again because the style was unique for each pass.  But there were  times when the style got in the way, when it didn't add a thing to the  narrative, and proved distracting.  But those times were few enough for me  to say that overall the style worked.  And it was so fun, and kinetic, and  riveting.  Like an 85-minute music video, with a cohesive (albeit  existential plot).  You can't not pay attention to Lola.
