B00AKATIG2|4|Ok first thing, it took almost 2 weeks to get to me! And i noticed this was because the shipper took a few extra days to ship the item. I really wanted it to go on my trip where we would have the chance to go swimming but it got here while I was on my trip, unfortunately.<br /><br />Next thing is how it looks: its so cute! I really love the length but I can see how it would be too short on some people. For me it fits like a mini skirt, covering just the little bit of extra fat I have around my thighs and under my butt. It makes me look so much sexier and toned because the rest of my body is toned except for the maybe pound of fat I have underneath the bum area at the top of my thighs. BUT for people with larger fat reservoirs in this area/a lot of cellulite going down their thighs, it wouldn't be long enough to cover. It really is a bit short, landing just under my bum, basically, I would never wear the skirt out in public if it was made of denim and intended for day wear! It would be called skimpy! But for the water, its so cute looking since everyone goes out wearing hardly anything anyways and this covers a bit more than most people but not enough to be pointed out as someone whose trying to hide something.<br /><br />What do I wish the product had?<br /><br />A different color! Black's fine but its a bit speedo looking or something, it just doesn't go with the colorful bikini's I own and makes the skirt stand out a bit too much as something I choose to wear over a bikini rather than a bottom that goes with my bikini top and came that way. Obviously I'll have to buy a black bikini top but I just wish this company offered more colors because the price is awesome compared to the price of everyone else's skirted bottoms on amazon and in stores. I found some sellers who sold coral pink, turquoise blue, white, or deep red but they expected around 50 to 80 dollars for it which is outrageous. If this company came out with a pink, blue, or white color I would be so happy! Honestly, I would rather have white than black, I think it goes with more bathing suits rather than stand right out like an ink blot on my body!<br /><br />I haven't swum in the skirt yet, but when I do I will comment on how it feels in the water, hopefully it doesn't balloon out like some people here have said!
B006R68F30|5|Sexy!!!! I was a little afraid to order especially without trying on first because I'm skinny n I have a smaller chest so I ordered a small and it looked great on! I'm 5'6  115lbs  bra size big A small B. There are ribbons / ties to adjust the tightness of the corset. I can wear it as sexy outfit in the bed room or as cute top casual or going out.<br />And the quickness in delivery wasn't too bad at all. I've bought one other corset from this seller and the review is pretty much the same. I'll def buy from this seller again.<br />The corset is not a deep black it's a lighter black or dark charcoal grey almost n skulls are off white. I read the reviews prior to ordering so I was aware of this. It's cuter in person than in the picture I think actually.
B00IZGEPYI|1|Description states working pockets, but, do not.
B0065JISR2|5|I missed buying this shirt when I saw it in a market, but I found it on Amazon! Of course!<br /><br />It's funny, professionally and well-printed, and a durable weight tee. No particular shrinkage or color bleeding. Exactly what I needed.
B00207PA6U|5|Fantasie is one of my favorite brands because they do large cups on a average band well. I got a 36G, although I wish this style came in the GG. I have 5 of this style because of how well it works with my clothes and even for nursing!  I converted 1 to a nursing bra with hooks, and just pull down the cups on the others. Love the 4520!
B0018T0O9Y|4|I absolutely love these jeans.  They're not as stretchy as the 524's I bought from Kohl's several years ago, but they're wonderful, and they held up very well.  I have very narrow hips and no behind, and these actually give me a little boost in the back.  Very happy with this product.
B000VDZ9TS|5|It is how I travel, saves space.<br /><br />Great for those wide belt loops.
B0009G86EW|5|very pleased with the product and the price.  It arrived quickly and I will be ordering more. I would reccomend this to my friends
B00167T8QS|5|great price good solid product
B00A4U15HS|1|These are cut very skimpy, and do not cover the cheeks.  They are woven, not knit, so the fabric does not stretch.  The appearance is cheaply made.  They went right back.
B0002TORVW|4|Although a bit thinner material than I am accustomed to, nice socks.  The elastic seems just right - not too loose, not too tight.  I would buy these socks again.
B0009U69ZG|5|Wow! Great fit. Tall size longer in the back and sleeve length perfect. Nice and warm. A great middle ground between a heavy chamois shirt and a winter jacket. Wish I'd ordered one of these a few years back!
B00HHFZ6F0|2|I'd like to exchange these for XXL apparently-they are TINY.
B00KE8H10A|5|Keeps my legs and nuggets nice and warm on cold New England days.
B00CFMNZNK|4|I've been wearing Hanes for years and I have no complaints. They're a decent product for a decent price and they wear well.  What else is there to say.
B00MOKGIFU|3|Somewhat large even at full term. Cute though.
B00IT2WOF0|5|Perfect for my sister's birthday!  Arrived on time and wrapped well.  It will be a festive celebration!
B006TLWMSM|5|Material is really nice, soft, and stretchy. Sizing is a little bit larger but it has a fitted waist so its figure flattering.
B00DDS8XP0|5|This shirt is great! Fit is good, and the weight and feel of the flannel is so much better than other flannel shirts.<br />I would recommend this shirt.
B00GZC762C|4|Good product
B004RQRCLI|5|Soft shipped fast not expensive at all work well bells are adorable i love them!
B00M2A7ZN6|5|this was a birthday gift for my sons birthday and he loved it. The leather was good quality and the security of not having credit cards scanned was great. It comes in several different colors and grains.
B001DDMQKK|4|The costume was really cute but the hat was squashed and bent up.  It didn't wear very well and I wasn't able to get it straightened out.
B00KHYHUHK|5|The fabric, the vibrant color & the fit exceeded my expectations.<br />It is not a bulky robe. It is light weight and comfortable and a great lounge robe.<br />I really appreciated the size selection and not just the one size fits all.<br />Definitely recommend.
B00GS19PHE|5|the laugh of the party
B00IRW7I76|2|I guess the jacketbis great but serves me no purpose cause I cant fit it.
B009YKDYUU|2|This jacket was WAY too small in the chest.  I normally wear an 8 or a 10, ordered this in a 10 because I don't like jackets to fit on the small side.  This was too small if you have any chest at all.  While it fit OK at the waist and in the arms, it looked horrible in the chest area because it covered none of it.  I have a 36DD chest, bigger than most, but I've never tried on a jacket that fit this poorly in this area.  I don't think sizing up would have made any difference because the chest area was SO small, and then the rest of it would have started becoming baggy.<br /><br />So, if you're flat chested, go for it.  If not, this won't fit.
B00M4K2A6Q|1|Don't like
B0012VZVK0|4|I am amazed: These are the first jeans I ever bought online, and they actually fit!!! They look good, and I am the only person who sees the silly, flimsy pink pocket lining. They seem true to size, and they are quite comfortable which is important to me. If they were offered in more colors, I would buy more!
B00BBOKT1O|2|comfy.  But within 2 days of usage the left pocket has 2 separate lartge holes.  I don't want to bother returning it.  not sure what to do at this point.
B000JIKN0A|5|Very comfortable, and easy to nurse in.  The back comes up a little high, but that doesn't impact my comfort at all.  This is the 3rd one I've purchased. I did have to purchase a larger size than expected.
B008RN2EKQ|5|around the top ,i am busty ,so its a lil tight
B00EH6TWV6|1|I ordered the smallest size and it still looks like I am wearing a cut-out garbage bag. Its huge!! I'm 5'6 and thin, but I'm still surprised at how large it fits for being the smallest size. Good thing I was not out very much money.
B00A0GGKJ4|5|5/5 would buy again
B00RA5992S|3|sent 2 dresses at same time with 2 different color sequins. one dress white the other dress pink.
B00FZR1CIW|5|These are great, comfortable panties that fit perfectly - they were priced right and they came quickly.
B008KBEE3K|5|This sports bra is exactly what I waslooking for! Next time I may order a smaller size though. it still fits well enough to support me the way it should. I never once thought something so amazing even existed!
B00P6VAWAQ|4|Good comfortable socks, but they do run big.
B008QNREDO|5|Good quality nice shirt
B00GY4V3EI|5|Love IT! Can't wait for it to cool down so I can wear it.
B00BCPJAUI|5|Good fit cool shirt. Husband loved it.
B00KID9410|4|Great dress, color is as pictured, very comfortable and forgiving. Stylish and pretty.  My only complaint was that the built in bra padding under the dress can potentially be seen in photos taken with a bright flash!  Other than that I am very happy with this dress!
B00RH9MBAO|5|looked great. great fit, and good material.
B00EMG3W1C|5|New baby outfit, too soon to know if it fits.
B003C25Q7K|5|Great cups for sewing into my bridesmaids dress.
B007RB919G|3|I really like the belt overall, but there is one huge flaw.  The buckle is held on by two small screws that seem to work themselves loose on a weekly basis.  I constantly find myself having to screw the buckle back onto my belt with my thumb nail.
B00E6OMZBS|2|The houndstooth looks more like herringbone. It's super tiny. The belt isn't made very well, either. It fits a little on the tiny side, too. The seller shipped it fast, though. So thanks for that.
B00LPQG138|3|They have to be returned.  They are too small. The most recent reviews don't really say too much on fit. I'm petite and ordered an xs and it was way too tight. I would say order a size up.  However the price is great and material is soft but doesn't stretch.
B00FZR1IAO|5|I got the taupe/peach/white set which is pictured at the time I am writing this review. The pack comes with 4 whites, 1 black, 1 peach, 1 taupe and 3 patterns. The colors are neutral enough to go with most anything in my wardrobe. Definitely a good buy.
B00J7VX5XC|5|This fits perfectly. The most comfortable piece of clothing I own. And so versatile! I'll be purchasing every color in the future!
B00A8F9G9S|5|these colors do good combination, I like it because it is out of the ordinary if somewhat opaque but looks cute and beautiful
B00BTKH7U6|5|good nautical tie.
B002LSI39Y|5|I didn't buy for myself I gave them as a gift.  the person who received them was happy with the item
B00E0TQ8Y4|5|Good quality for the price. I will definitely by more dresses for my daughter from this supplier. The color was dead on for the event it was needed for. I was impressed by the elegance of the dress...
B00JDNLDX8|2|Really square
B008BB94A2|4|I have been looking for a claddagh ring for a long time and I was really excited when I ordered this one! The quality is amazing; very strong and thick stainless steel but enough detail to look feminine. When the ring came in it was packed in a cute little box inside a blue satin bag. I am a size 7 so I ordered a size 7 and it fits me perfectly. The only downside about this ring is that heart and crown are much larger than in the photo. If you're looking for a delicate ring this is not the one for you. But overall I would buy this ring again!
B004479B0K|5|nice sturdy well made belt that looks attractive.  good price and fast service, and sizing seems about right also.  Great!
B006ZM89IM|5|Got this as a replacement wallet for my son after his original Tyvek mighty wallet got washed in the washing machine.  The original actually held up pretty well after being washed, but the print was pretty faded.  This was a perfect replacement.
B00JPJFU3O|5|I bought this for my Finn costume and it fit great! And it came on time too. Great buy!
B001CBJ3EU|2|Lace tie back is cumbersome, and sizing of the top is a bit small. decent quality material.
B006R5RJ8I|5|My 12 year old daughter loves Glenn & Mitchell. Her and my husband imitate them all the time. The shirt quality was great. She's 5'5\\" and the medium was perfect for her. i made this purchase a couple weeks before Mitchell passed away so I am extremely glad I bought it for her. She loved it when I surprised her with and it's now her favorite shirt.
B002PJ3T3O|4|The tie bar is approx 2.25 inches, which they should have mentioned.<br />It is a nice tie bar for formal occasions
B00EBTEW6Y|4|These are really cute socks!  They're thin enough for me to wear with flats but block some wind chill during the chilly New England winters. They are definitely meant for juniors though. I have thin legs and these socks can be irritating where the elastic sits under my knees on longer days.
B00T838X8G|4|Is very tight which you will get use to it after your waist adjust to the waist trainer.
B00LEP184M|4|Fit just as I expected it to. The hood was a bit large to the point I couldn't see much. Still an awesome jacket!
B00N4CEGEW|5|Perfect as expected
B008Y23ZNA|2|Now it seems to me Mr. Morphsuit, a child wearing this costume at night to go trick-or-treating is in grave danger of being hit by a car.
B001K2G62S|5|Great product and fast delivery. Comfortable hat great for any type of activity. Ball cap brim adds style and shade from sun outside in the cold.
B00K0HQ6JM|4|love product
B00WMF7OC8|5|great color, nice quality.  it's really cute
B00BZ5QZEO|4|I bought this outfit from America to come to the uk, I read the reviews about it being an &#34;awkward fit&#34;. I bought the costume despite the lowish reviews. So it has arrived quickly actually which I'm happy about. The wig I wouldn't recommend, I have bought my own wig and styled it myself. It's ok, but it's just average, it came in a wig net and wasn't flattened which was a positive but I shall not be using it.<br /><br />Next I read the reviews on the tights that come with it, they were correct, the tights are designed for a child, no way shape or form would they fit an adult. I bought a large to compensate as I read the costume runs small. I am a uk size 10 and a large was far too big for me however I believed the tights would fit okay but I think they are &#34;one size&#34; that fits nobody. If you do buy this costume, you will need to buy a separate pair of tights and I would also recommend only buying a size up from what you are just to be safe but I should have just bought a medium.<br /><br />The actual leotard is great apart from it being too big. It isn't very figure hugging I admit but this is where you do your own little DIY if you know how to or give it to someone that does. As stated in other reviews it is quite &#34;tent like&#34; around the hips and waist and doesn't fit as shown on the model in the photo the elastic I also found doesn't cut into your skin around the upper leg and crotch area which is really nice but as I said I bought the larger size. I haven't tried the boot covers on over any shows yet but as far as I can see they don't seem to be too bad.<br /><br />I also read the outfit was quite sheer? I don't agree with this, I wore a black bra upon trying this costume on and I couldn't see my bra through it. I read in previous reviews the gusset (crotch) area was small and uncomfortable, for me I felt it was more than comfortable and it was fine. This may vary depending on the size I assume.<br /><br />I also found as I bought a large the left arm sleeve was baggy and didn't fit well, I feel this was because of the sizing I chose but this could also be a minor problem that may need altering.<br /><br />So the positives about this costume are<br /><br />Great colour and likeness of cheetara<br />Not really sheer<br />Comfortable and it's a nice material<br />Once altered and modified it could be a great costume (this is my opinion as I bought the large size, if I had purchased a smaller size it might not be so &#34;baggy&#34; in areas)<br />Quick and reliable shipping<br /><br />Negatives<br /><br />Wig is average<br />Tights do not fit at all and to be honest are quite sheer no opaque<br />Sizing is awkward, it's hard to decide which size to buy as it is an awkward fit I recommend buy a size up and alter it<br />Price is reasonable but as you have to buy your own tights and wig (optional) it can become quite costly<br /><br />So I have give this costume 4 stars, even though there are quite a few negatives, I would recommend this costume ONLY IF YOU ARE WILLING TO MODIFY IT YOURSELF. If you just want a costume to throw on and go, I do not recommend this. For it to look good you will need to make adjustments.<br /><br />I hope this helps people in deciding to buy this costume :)he left arm sleeve was baggy and didn't fit well, I feel this was because of the sizing I chose but this could also be a minor problem that may need altering.<br /><br />So the positives about this costume are<br /><br />Great colour and likeness of cheetara<br />Not really sheer<br />Comfortable and it's a nice material<br />Once altered and modified it could be a great costume (this is my opinion as I bought the large size, if I had purchased a smaller size it might not be so &#34;baggy&#34; in areas)<br />Quick and reliable shipping<br /><br />Negatives<br /><br />Wig is average<br />Tights do not fit at all and to be honest are quite sheer no opaque<br />Sizing is awkward, it's hard to decide which size to buy as it is an awkward fit I recommend buy a size up and alter it<br />Price is reasonable but as you have to buy your own tights and wig (optional) it can become quite costly<br /><br />So I have give this costume 4 stars, even though there are quite a few negatives, I would recommend this costume ONLY IF YOU ARE WILLING TO MODIFY IT YOURSELF.

B005CPL36I|5|great for my son's kilt
B0002TOZ1E|2|I should have read the description more thoroughly. The socks look great. but the spandex in them make them uncomfortable. My my previous gold toes did not have spandex, If you don't like tight socks don't purchase these.
B002V72BM0|5|Super soft, super comfortable. Great length. Got some for my grandparents and they love them! Bought a pair for myself, too. I haven't washed them so I don't know how they are post-wash, but they are made of great material and are durable. Get some, you won't regret it!
B00MN5JZH4|5|This shirt is soft and comfortable. It washes well and the design holds up perfectly. It is a good quality shirt. I get a lot of comments when I wear it.
B001HNMOAS|5|I got this a few days ago. It's nice and warm and I like the design.
B00RZ4ZHMA|5|Great dress, nice material, fits well
B00U0XCDF2|3|Fits great, but I don't love the drape of this fabric. It isn't terribly flattering. It's fairly comfortable, though.
B00K0LBBEI|5|I like them a lot, they fit good and look good too, good quality and fit with most outfits, good purchase.
B00H9584WU|5|great fit... great feel!! love em. will order more soon!
B00CE5PUX6|1|The jockstrap fits well and feels good. This was only after I have to search on youtube on how to remove the Anti-Theft Security Tag which came with the jockstrap.
B00DD5ZBCQ|4|I had been on the hunt for the perfect camo jacket. I live in SoCal where the weather is mild all year round - even during fall and winter so I didn't have expectations that this would be a \\"winter coat\\". After reading other reviews, I decided to go a size up so that I have the option to layer as much or as little underneath, depending on the weather/season. I tried it on with a tank underneath and then also with a thin sweater and the versatility is definitely a plus in my book.<br /><br />I had been having a difficult time finding a camo jacket that wasn't boxy; I'm petite so it's doubly important for me to find pieces that have flattering cuts and in this case, cinching in the waist. I do love the detailing of the studs on the arms - I can't stop thinking about how adorable this jacket will be over a cream colored lacy tank/shell, skinnies, and a pair of stilettos. It'll be the perfect mix of edgy and feminine. I like the one reviewer's comment about how this almost looks like something you'd find at Anthropologie (my favorite clothing store of all time!) but not at the Anthro price.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars?...As mentioned, I'm petite so I the arms were a bit long on me (maybe it's also because I decided to size up?). So not quite the *perfect* fit. However, this jacket is reasonably priced so it's something I'm willing to look over and if it bother's me enough, I can just go to my tailor's to get it taken up. For now, I've just resolved to roll the sleeves under.<br /><br />In summary: the price is great, the fit (although not perfect) is good for me, and it's adorable - overall, very happy with my purchase.
B00NKN1OHW|4|Ok. Fits differently than anticipated but still a cute dress for the price.
B006WFG1Q4|4|these shirts run small but are really nice the white part on this one is kinda stretchy kinda but also gets super linty witch is annoying but over all I'm happy and it looks really nice
B00558U4U8|5|Very nice quality cotton with good, clear print. The t-shirt arrived looking exactly as I had hoped it would.
B006YITFH6|1|This shirt is really bad. First of all the message is appalling. Secondly the shirt is poor quality and shipping took to long. This is truly the worst of Amazon!!!!
B00GRS40YQ|3|Warm and soft, but the product received was not as pictured. I was sent footed tights rather than the pictured footless tights. Sizing was ok - I'm 5'3&#34; and 133 lbs and fit in a M/L perfectly fine.
B00CBI1Q70|5|These jeans seem to hug every curve and are so soft and comfortable. Doesn't feel as stiff as a regular pair when you first wear them. So happy I ordered them in different colors also.
B00FXQ1N7U|1|Sent 2xl long wrong size but found some one who could wear them...
B00UN2TQXC|5|Love the the material. colors and fit.
B002N52K4E|5|I bought the matching gown and robe for my mother and she absolutely loved it - good quality - good sizing - good color!  The product is what is advertised.
B0072D9NMY|5|Love this shirt, runs long.  But for me I prefer shorts that go past my hips.  Hides all the mistakes on my body.
B00TATKENK|1|Order 3x This is more like Large I must now return them
B000JHHFDE|5|Brother is short and these are one of the few that make it in his size.  Held up well to his abuse.  Thank you for offering them and will probably order more for next season!
B001HO7VG4|5|I am not sorry i bought this cap I am always on the lookout for a great bargain and this was one of them. It not only fits well but is also very stylish and the leather is very soft definately a keeper.
B00F6CKN9U|5|For the price you can not beat this. I was very happy with this product and wore it the next day. It is a little shear. Im 5' 6&#34; 128 and the small fit great. Will order agian. Shipping was great got earlier than expected
B007TQA062|5|Awesome
B00CAUYAKE|4|Great jacket fit as expected.
B00JX1GCDG|5|Super cute, love how flowy it is. It is a little small, length-wise. Glad I ordered a size up.
B003YJBYPE|5|they feel comfortable on my feet, size is not a problem at all. And the price is very reasonable for this product.
B00ENLMP00|5|Bought as a gift. She loved it.
B004L8J0C6|5|These were a perfect replacement for my missing Wurkin Stiffs Collar Stays I lost in the wash/dryer at a fraction of the cost. Their is a size to fit any need - definitely worth the purchase.
B00HV4OQTE|3|Beautiful jacket, but a size smaller than I anticipated. A woman's curse: order a large thinking you're ok with large ... Then realize this company brands you an extra large in their standards. (Basing my &#34;large&#34; status off Gap (etc) and JCrew measurements). I'll keep it though, and toast to one day fitting into it again, or making someone happy at Salvation Army. I'm too lazy to deal with returns.
B00SKQ7O2S|5|I got it for a surprise for my boyfriend and he loved it!!!
B00GYW9O0A|2|These jeans are well made and soft, but fit small.  I didn't like the way they fit my curves either.  I had to return them.
B006LW1QWC|3|The only image describing this product was misleading.  The lotus sparkles are made of plastic, and the crystals on the top fall off easily.  The entire thing is so heavy that if not clasping a lot of hair, it just falls pulling it.  This clip is much larger than it seems.
B000HX58KM|5|My son is very pleased with his new sweater, he states that it is very comfortable & nice to wear. Happy customer.
B0076CLTRI|5|I got this for my daughter for her birthday and it is the CUTEST!!! We love Shorthands!! Great quality shirts!
B003CUPHEO|4|the costume is &#34;one size fits all&#34; therefore don't expect to fit perfectly to your body.
B00L5IWKRW|1|Wouldn't buy again
B004K4976U|5|I ran my first 10k in this in 30 minutes! LOVE THE NEON SUPERWOMEN POWER! THANKS SO MUCH! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
B00422YLW0|5|very comfortable
B00BPXQC6M|5|pretty much the best shirt ever...
B00KGZJVEU|4|Takes a minute to figure out how to put it on, looks exactly as pictured. Material is thin so undergarments will not be possible at all!
B007AKEWR0|5|These pants are soft, comfy, and holding up well after months of wash and wear. We bought my husband's usual size and the fit is good.
B00CXM8VG8|2|The neckline is not a V but a scoop neck which is disappointing because it says V in the description. Beaded &#34;necklace&#34; adornment not attractive and much sheerer than I had expected.
B00MY67JPC|5|Fits and feels great!!
B00CQ75852|4|The hand is a little short for my long arms. I have a long wingspan. XL would fit okay but that would defeat the purpose because I need a slim fit shirt.
B009FBXIPE|3|The hat was intact, fit as advertised, but the box shipped in was slightly too small, resulting in bent brim, which was very unfortunate.  Hat probably could have worked, but Jed Clampit wasn't the look I wanted.
B00F4WT97E|2|I like the shirt but an XL should fit. It is way to small!!!! It fits like a small! I also had no idea the shirts I ordered would be shipped directly from China!
B005FKUYQU|1|I ordered these in a size 12 Med.  Here's what I received:  Boy's 510 Levi Strauss Skinny Fit  size 29 X 32.  How??
B00NLZG0IM|2|The sweater was stretched around the colar like someone tried it on and took it off disgust. The ribbed cuffs on the bottom of the sleeve was really loose also. This purchase was a disappointment
B00R6SO2U8|5|Received the dress and put it on immediately. It IS a loose fit, but in a cute and flattering way. I received a ton of compliments on it. Super versatile style, you could easily dress it up or down.
B00337PRH8|3|This is not an expensive, well made product.  It is a very inexpensive well made product.  The card slots are a bit tight but should stretch with time.  I have carried this now for a week and it is breaking in and handling the wear.  Understand what you are buying and you will be happy.
B00SRE8S14|5|super cute and flattering.  I prefer dresses below the knee and this is perfect
B008R0Q2FC|4|Sweet little pin where it on my law enforcement uniform , eighty duce is on the loose
B00EK5OBHO|5|Just beautiful.  I feel so sexy and put together in this!  Great bargain. I've been looking for something like this for a really long time, I'm so excited about it! Quality is really great for the price.
B00B2SKSHO|4|Good basic scarf, comfortable to wear, wish it was a little wider
B00CDAZ38Y|5|My daughter bought the cutes summer dress but it was supper thin. I told her (after she tried different things) she needed a slip! So we looked and found the priced ok. We gave  this one a try and ordered it in nude and black! They are awesome!
B00M2HQ6S4|1|Do not buy this product. It's a scam. They literally sent me a bottom and the top is like 10 feet of just cloth. Like they cut the cloth into a long rectangle and expect you to wrap it yourself. It doesn't fit how the picture is and does not send instructions on how to even attempt to tie it. I was upset to have received unsown clothes.
B0029GPH88|5|A gift for my boyfriend who is always working outside...and he loves it. He says it was super comfortable, and extra long so it can easily be tucked in. High quality, heavyweight shirt.
B00JQT031M|5|Nice
B0066SK154|5|This hat was purchased for a 1920 themed wedding. The hat was slightly large so you may consider that when purchasing. The quality was very nice, much better than expected, great value for thebprice.many compliments were received on the hat!! Very pleased
B00Q1NTAB0|5|Just what I was looking for great jacket
B00EE5HHA8|5|Great deal, fast shipping, I love it, seller recommended
B00BPDZAI8|5|I shop online frequently and this by far is my favorite purchase.  This dress fits great looks great and travels great.  Plus anytime I need a confidence boost I wear the dress and get compliments galore.
B00KEZYGHO|5|Fit a bit large, but that's better than being small. Material is a nice quality and will see lots of use. I think I would still buy again or recommend. It's adorable!
B004G09D4O|5|Some of the best shorts I have ever owned. Comfortable. The cap opener in the pocket is good quality and metal, so it will not break. Do recommend.
B004D38PCK|5|Was well please with these pants. The fit was excellent.
B007IEG65E|5|I got this to wear for a funky alien costume I'm making- it is really cute The lighter colored pieces are not as much of a contrast as the picture for the product shows, but it is still pretty adorable and looks very nice.
B0000ZE7G8|5|this is a comfortable low-rise thong.  Very light-weight, and you don't know you are wearing it.  I find that I need to buy up one size from what I normally would wear.
B0036UTLMY|5|This was a great wig for a Halloween costume. Felt silky and smooth. Not fuzzy. Great wig for the price!
B009ERDPFC|4|Nothing extravagant but doesn't look too cheap.  It's just a nice basic set that's great to have in your closet.
B00BKRMCSU|5|Very nice dress. My expectations were met.
B008HZ733C|5|I have never been able to find a good comfortable bra at a reasonable price till now.I have a respiratory disease so comfort around my chest without anything being too constricting is important.This bra is so comfortable that I forget I'm wearing it :)
B00CZ5081O|5|Super cute and can't wait for it to get a little warmer to use!
B0056G80Z0|5|shirt wears well and holds up great
B00HW58N4G|5|Very cute and well made. My daughter received quite a few compliments and loves wearing it.
B0002TOZ1Y|5|As expected these socks were well made, soft and comfortable. Through one washing they have held their shape and size and remain comfortable. At this point I highly recommend  these socks to anyone looking for this type of hosiery.
B00IK68HDS|3|I received different colors than I expected. One pair began unraveling after a couple washings.
B00X5GX88W|3|Nice length; but a bit close by the waist. I'm a small so I bought the skirt the same size... A more comfortable fit would have been medium.
B0067OHN30|5|It is one of my sons favorite shirts. He says he's a super hero and hell save the day because he's wearing this shirt.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Mrs. &#34;I&#34;
B002IF67H0|5|I'm incredibly pleased with this product. It came in a wonderfully long plastic packaging which was the first good sign. When I took it out, it was wrinkle free, and made out of a very nice fabric. It was the perfect length for me, no stepping on it as I walk, and nice and loose for the clothes underneath. All in all, a very great product.
B00IABK0ZQ|5|I bought these laces to replace a pair I had in a pair of running shoes that were too short.  I wear a size 8 1/2 in women's and ordered these laces in the 54&#34; and they worked perfectly.  They were shaped just like the ones that came in my shoes so they worked great.  Now I can tie my shoes!!
B00HLRNUWK|5|Love this backpack. Small enough for a kid and big enough for me to pack for overnight too!
B006TJPVY6|5|I bought these socks for a 1970's themed photo shoot, and they were great! The colors are not primary, more of softer girlier colors than the decade and roller disco was known for, but they worked fine! They are a little snug, better for thinner calves.
B002R0FAA6|5|Good quality but fits a little smaller than I thought it would. Next time I would order the next size bigger.
B000NRQKXG|5|No problems
B00AQJU5KU|4|Fabric very soft and comfortable
B00GSXR7CM|3|The slipper socks looked larger in picture. The recepients indicated they liked the gift. I thought they could be larger.
B00N0250ZK|5|Nice shirts. They wash and wear well.
B009YB0EQ6|5|Bought this dress for my daughter she loved the colors and the fit of the dress... She wore the dress on a carnival cruise everyone loved it!
B00CAA0L7U|2|Costume was a lot shorter than expected based on reviews.  Costume also did not include the skirt as indicated.
B00KGWAFES|5|Got this for my sister's halloween costume. She teaches Kindergarten/1st grade and wanted to be &#34;Super Teacher&#34;. We had an early party on Sat, but she realized she forgot to order the shirt. Order was placed on Tuesday, and we weren't sure if we'd get it in time for the early party. To our amazement, it arrived Friday. She was so excited. It fit, and she looked great in her &#34;costume&#34;. She loves that the top of the &#34;super teacher&#34; sign is the top of an apple.<br /><br />Thanks so much for such a quick turn around!
B00K80KCZA|5|I ordered size 32 and it fits perfectly. Best bra ever!!! Happy customer!
B003E6PHL4|5|I ordered two pairs of the traditional fit dark stone jeans for my son.  They fit absolutely perfectly, with no fullness in the waist area, hips, or legs.<br />the material is soft, yet has a thickness that you know will be durable.  They looked and fit really nice also with his western boots.  It has been a wonderful thing to realize that Carhart makes jeans in addition to khaki pants.
B00JM0YVMW|5|My husband really wanted to slim down his wallet and this Bellboy wallet was the perfect solution!  It is a good quality leather and seems well stitched.  Though the cost is a bit more than other wallets, it does the job perfectly and looks great!
B002SKQZAY|4|I ordered 3 pairs of these socks.  I was not sure of the sizing so I thought I would give it a try anyway. They are super cute.  They are an ok fit for my 3rd grader (she's a size 1.5)...but for the smaller girls (size 11, 13) they are baggy.  I wear a women's 7...they are an ok (tighter) fit for me, but bigger than a W's 7 is starting to get too big for the socks.
B008PQP06A|4|Is quite a bit thinner than my old rugby jerseys.  It is more like  T-shirt material.  Other than that it is great
B00IZ38GLE|3|Loved it
B009IQYUTE|5|This outfit is stylish on my little guy, but also very soft and comfortable.  He is very active now and the outfit allows for crawling and tons of movement.
B0014K4QFA|5|I spend a lot of time being active outdoors and need tee shirts that move with me.  The color is perfect and I love the fabric.
B002IRKKJ4|4|Very cute and completed my daughter's Alice costume. The space inside is too small though... She had a hard time fitting just her phone inside.
B00MQJ25OW|5|Works well and seems to be good quality for the price. Not much you can say about bra straps, but they didn't seem cheap or fragile, so 5 stars for these!
B00LI6P49C|4|the image is crooked a lil bit, the size is ok, but still cool because its still bttf.
B005EP6SFM|5|Bonito conjunto de niños. muy buena calidad , lo recomiendo los colores hermoso., a los niños les encanta por lo cómodo que es...
B00AA4XG8Y|3|Great summer bra but not for support.
B00ACIGNH4|5|Good price on these undies for hubby.  Quick shipping, great price.  Nice fit and are soft.  Washes up well. will purchase again.
B007J5LP6M|3|It definetly does some defining but I had a few problems with it.<br />( by the way i'm 5' 3&#34; 120 pounds 34b)<br /><br />The main cons:<br /><br />Where it curves around the bra area is kind of akward. It didn't sit well under my bra but kinda rode up over it and cut off my boob making a double boob kinda look.<br /> It didn't have as much tummy support as I would have hoped although it is super tight it doesn't hold in my little pooch like my nylons do.<br /><br />You can only wear it with long dresses or skirts. I didn't realize this until after I bought it and went to try it on with a shorter skirt.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />I feel like it improves my posture a bit as everything is pulled in tighter.<br />It's fun to wear.<br />It's nice that it has the pee slot.
B0089NM9RC|5|My husband purchased these for me five years ago at a local business. Loving Amazon the way I do... I was curious? Do they carry these socks that I love , but unfortunately need to be replaced? Yes !!!! I ordered them ,washed  them, have worn them.  I'm here to say<br />&#34; they are terrific and as good as they were 5 years ago&#34;.  these are the perfect boots Socks !
B00BJGMTZ8|5|I was a little concerned when I ordered this dress,but the seller soon made my worries all go away. She emailed me requesting my measurements and made the dress perfectly to my body and she kept in touch with me through the whole process. It is a wonderful company and I absolutely love my dress. It is so beautiful and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
B00JAWCLFG|3|They fit extremely large, make sure to buy a smaller size than you think you need.
B008FZOXEQ|5|Like you Im sitting, reading through tons of reviews, trying to decide to take the plunge and spend the money to buy, what could possibly be, another unflattering article for my wardrobe. You happen across one review that seems slightly negative, and you've started to convince yourself not to buy the product. DONT LISTEN!! BUY THE PANTS<br />They are the most flattering and comfortable workout/yoga/lounge/lazy ass pants you will buy...EVER!<br />I bought the pants, tank and hoodie all in black. The fabric looks expensive and it's perfectly tailored. The personal note is an adorable touch and the customer service is the best you can hope to come across. I ordered the long sleeve hoodie but received the sleeveless. I called the OWNER of the company, and he personally apologized and sent out the new one that very minute. I didn't have to go through a hassle, the OWNER just picked up the phone and said hello. I was armed and ready to deal with automated voices and stupid customer service people in a foreign country, but NOPE.<br />I had to order multiple more just so I don't wear this first set out!<br />Im 6'1, 31 waist. I bought the Pants and Tank in a &#34;M&#34; and the Hoodie initially in a &#34;M&#34; as well until I tried on the sleeveless and then asked for a  &#34;L&#34;. The Hoodies seem to run pretty snug and even the &#34;L&#34; is still snug but I like my outerwear to look fitted.
B00L84D57M|5|Great buy!
B00CA2VXN4|5|I like the color, it is a beautiful royal blue. I put it on and it looked exactly as shown on the picture. Thanks.
B000V046LS|4|I like this hat, its super cute and doesn't itch. I'v gotton lots of compliments on it and 2 people want me to order them one. :)
B00CX0LPPO|4|I bought them for my 13-year-old son, who is a little short for his age.<br />The size is perfect for him, so they might be too small for an average 14-year-old boy.<br />I bought another pair (color: BAYOU) and have noticed that this fabric is thinner than the other pair.
B00GBG6GFU|5|love love love this dress!! I ordered an xs..I am only 4'11&#34; and the length and fit is perfect and the material is super comfy!
B00CVJQF2K|3|the color is perfect, but it came in such a big size i had to resew the bottom and sides to make it fit me. also, the patches are not embroidered, they are printed on. the inside is lined which is nice. but still a little disappointed even though I sent in my exact measurements the size was still wrong.
B002G9UDY6|5|Great hat!
B00NF405QC|5|He loved it!
B0055PFKR8|5|the tee was very colorful and the picture was clear and bright it will fit my daughter perfect she will love it the anime items we get are so very nice thank you
B005TNBRR8|1|Sure, it's nice and my niece loves it.  But it took over a month to come from China and I had to tell her that her Christmas present was delayed.  It was my fault ordering it and not knowing what it came from, but do yourself a favor and order it from some place stateside that way you get it in a reasonable amount of time.
B0096NH8L6|4|As others stated it is not really fitted but more boxy. Still all that was left was large and I do like the jacket very much. Warm and feels well made.
B003EEMHUA|4|Overall this hoodie was what I was expecting. It seems well made. I'm anticipating wearing it for a long time.
B003E89038|3|This is a decent costume item, but it is way too small for an adult. I have a 34 inch waste and it barely fit on the last hole. There was no hanging down like the picture shows. It would be fine for a boy with a small waste - not a man.
B00ESMW61C|5|I love it my grandaughter will to
B004TQHJJ6|4|Brought for my husband
B00QKROMZQ|5|So little girl cute.
B00GU16RXC|4|Bought this for my significant other as a gift. Very satisfied with sizing and print design.
B00LB25O6Q|5|great for the price
B0007OERXA|5|Bien
B00F2ZX4ZQ|5|I think this is such a cute hat. I'm very happy that I ordered it. The fit and style are great!
B008OX6SYW|4|My daughter loves it. She trie to wear  every single day she love it<br />I think I will need to buy a new pair
B00IO9JCY4|5|Great
B00AHTK5Q8|2|It's too small as mentioned before.<br />I actually wanna buy small but buy medium. HOWEVER, it's hard to put off.
B00DN1FHCE|3|Comes out of the dryer with lint that needs brushed off.
B000AN7F8C|1|I was excited to receive these Pants, Expensive for the quality and They ran way Too Large ,even after a good wash & dry - the Return Policy States that they must be returned without washing , I have to have them Altered which ads more to the cost! I would like to have had them returned for a smaller size -I am a 4-6 so I went with the small , I was going by the size chart , I needed an  extra Small ,beware the sizes run Larger . At any rate I now own them and I am sure that after modifications they will last a long time -the fit  does not look at all like the Models fit on screen.She must be wearing an extra small.I am Disappointed , especially by thinking they would have a nicer fit then they actually had. They look Sloppy on - not Sexy or stylish. they will be Used for Yardwork only.
B00KS7C8MS|4|I bought this as a down sweater on clearance.<br /><br />This is billed as a &#34;winter Jacket&#34;  I really don't think so!  I have been wanting a down sweater for fall and spring, and this is it.  As compared to my 80 dollar LLBean down jacket, the LLBean is warmer hands down.  There really is no comparison!  However, I have been wanting a down Jacket that doesn't make me look like the Stay Puffed Marshmallow man.  This is it.  They bill this as  a winter Jacket, and I wore it over the last two days in 32 degree weather and it is OKAY.  If you stay moving it is fine.  However, I wouldn't want to be standing around in this thing in the cold.<br /><br />It will be perfect for fall and spring.  There are many complaints that it fits like a bell, but that is not the case with me.  I am 5,10&#34;, and currently 180 pounds.  I have someone broad shoulders, and peck muscles, and a slight belly.<br /><br />For me, it is somewhat snug in the shoulders and chest, and arms, but not overly so.  The snugness is more pronounced when sitting down with it zipped up.<br /><br />My wife says I pull it off.  It is almost exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />I would give it more stars, but they list this as a winter jacket.  It is okay, but I prefere my 80 dollar LLBean that was a backpacker editors pick, for really cold weather..<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />To give you some clue on proper sizing, my chest measures 44.5 inches, my shoulders measure 51-52 inches, and I have very little beer belly.  I just measured around my stomach, and it is 37 inches.  When I bought the Jacket, I had a little bigger belly. I measured my waste at 35.5
B00FE6VP6I|3|Somewhat large for a 'small', but a nice item and fast delivery.
B000VK5W1G|2|The bust area is OK; but there is not enough strap for adjusting. I could barely get my arms through the straps after I fastened the bra. Then it was too tight and very uncomfortable with the thin straps. When the bra size has double letters attached, the sides (under the arms) should be high enough to hold the double letters without bulging.  I don't have a lot; but even that little shows through the clothing.  Beutiful looking; but not made for USA women.
B0033HXGG2|5|I've ordered two of these ties --- they are great -- look great  ---  feel great.  Many compliments.  Feel like a power-tie guy again !!
B0056B8406|5|It gets hot after a while as expected.  Other than that it's great for a costume!
B00D3JU1U4|5|perfect gift for my son...nice material and desisign
B002LRUB4U|1|Bad wayyy to big and not realistic
B007U3J26S|5|this was one of the better costume wigs I've seen for awhile. The wig is thick has room for your own hair and looked good. I would highly recommend if you are  looking for this type of costume wig.
B00D3F8FRE|5|I got this for my daughter. She loves hats & her wedding is coming up so thought it would be cute as a gag gift for her shower last weekend! She loved it! Everybody thought it was cute too!
B00E52WG1K|2|so far so good
B00HS3ZEOO|5|I ordered these snow pants for my five year old grandson.  He will be wearing them next January, 2016 for a snow day.  They do run big, but of course he will grow into them.  I wanted them for more than one season.<br />They are fabulous.  Great buy.  They are made very well.  I am so happy with them.  I did buy him suspenders.  They will fit fabulous with the suspenders.  Dont pass up this offer.  Thanks so much for a beautiful product.
B004R1I9UG|5|I am 5'7'' and 123lb. I have broad shoulders and 34A, my waist is ~25 inches. I prefer my T-shirts to be somewhat fitted on me. I bought size small.<br /><br />These T-shirts (I bough 3) fit me very well. They are not too small on my big shoulders and are tight enough around the waist.<br /><br />The colors are nice and hold well for about three to four month (I was my t-shirts a lot). The fabric is soft, does not have much stretch to it though (which is not a problem to me).<br /><br />I wear these T-shirts under sweaters, under shirts and just on their own----they are very versatile.<br /><br />I highly recommend them!
B00UT3KXQ4|5|My kids love these. They fit well and don't shrink in the wash.
B00BHILNVY|2|Have bought these jeans before and they fit fine, this pair was baggy in the back.
B001SLF9MY|5|I purchase it because I was pregnant and need a bra without wire but with a good support. This one is perfect!
B00E9QZM04|1|I do not like it the wires don't come all the way up under the arm it stops in the middle and it's very annoying
B00MH10YK6|5|I love this shirt so much!!
B004R1G6C4|5|I was afraid i wouldnt get my tie dye shirt before halloween , I ordered it on Oct. 23rd and i received it on the 25th. The shirt looked exactly like the picture. Would definitly do business with again.
B00768HF4I|4|As good as any good wig. Long hair on wigs is extremely hard to maintain, but it has not lost a lot of strands despite some rather rough handling. Definitely worth the money. Not as long as it *appears* in the image, though. I know the measurements are there, but I personally believe the image is misleading and would have preferred to have been able to see a female model wearing it. Satisfaction B+
B00LWYCGRI|5|Looks IDENTICAL to my real triangl bikini. I have a small in my original triangl, and a medium in this and they fit the same. I would definitely order again in another color.
B004TURK2I|5|This wig is nice, the hair wasn't tangled when it arrived, the hair is soft but my only concern is how poofy the top is. That is my only complaint. but i wear a bandanna with it to hide the extra volume at the top and it looks nice. overall a good wig, nice length, love the color. just alittle too poofy at the top for my taste.
B00GZ3E3X6|4|Large thick and too warm!!! But it was a hit. Does not photograph well I looked huuuuge in it. It got the job done though!
B00CEP1ICS|3|the fabric felt great it's smooth and soft i really like it but the size was to small so i don't wear them
B00H5MZ2E0|4|My girl love this sweater! its soft and cozy!
B006UNO3D6|4|I bought for my grown son who is a huge Dr. Who fan and he loved it!!!  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is it could have been a little longer for an xl.
B007XVVMNI|5|I wore this to a bachelorette party and everybody loved it. Super comfortable and fits great. I wear a large and ordered medium and large. Both fit but I choose the large because I'm older and didn't want it too snug.
B008LOZ6S8|5|Very good, the color is just right. Thanks
B009FHIRD6|3|This is a cute outfit and of good quality, but it runs very small.  I bought the 6-12 month size and he wasn't able to wear it past 5 months.  He's kind of a big baby, but that seems ridiculous.
B00817ECTY|5|great fit, comfortable
B00MSOC9A0|5|Lightweight, comfortable shirt.
B006FYP96U|5|WW are the most comfortable scrubs I have ever worn in 23yrs of wearing scrubs!!!  True to size so you wont have to guess which size to buy!
B0008EOBXA|2|I bought these pants as work pants for my son after seeing their great ratings. He wore the first pair straight out of the package and it was the right length. Then he washed both and they are a couple inches too short! Disappointed.
B00D840R7Q|5|These are great water shoes for a toddler. Nice fit and flexible sole.
B00CYA4FM8|3|It fit as expected and did well in the washer and dryer. However the hair accessories included broke off right away. Also, the noses on all three princesses aren't drawn in all the way so they look odd.
B0040Y5LBA|2|The waistline is horrible. Needs elastic!!!!
B0018OY3MI|5|Pants fit great ordering more in the future.
B007S9U0ZQ|1|This \\"dress\\" is totally different from what you see on the picture.  Material looks flowy and soft on the picture but in reality this is thick coarse cloth with no hint to a nice cute dress on the picture. This dress is probably created for the winter season for those who like to wear summer cloths in winter or......... I even do not know what the \\"designer\\" was thinking he/she was making this dress for when he/she used this cloth
B00HJ46D2O|5|Love these socks!
B005CSNUTS|5|Very well made with a proper fit at a reasonable price.  Launders well with no fade or shrinking.  Highly recommended.
B00M0RIJV8|1|They are not true to size. I gave them to my daughter.
B00411Y866|3|The face never really looks right because it's always going to be smashed in from the packing.  They need a wire in the nose so that it stays circular.  The glass was broken during shipping
B00B1NL9KK|3|I purchased a xl and it's a lil bit small. I'm not going to return it  I 'm going to  keep it and lose some pds.
B00I02DZR0|5|This dress fits nicely, looks sweet yet professional, is comfortable, and will probably wash easily and well.  I'd get another in another pattern if there were one.
B00I16HYHW|5|Its stretchy fabric, and fits perfectly !!
B000QIU4UM|5|If you work outdoors or in a very hot space, you really need some of these. I use mine everyday. I rinse them out at the end of the day and then pop them in the fridge to keep them really cool. I was really amazed at how well they work.
B00KJDPLH0|5|love it
B00M199Y4G|3|Its not plastic...It's sticky but did hold my boobs in place runs small
B005VM2OW4|4|arrived at time, the image of product was accord with the real product, i dont have any problem with deivery product
B00EON0WH0|5|Love this! It's perfect for my event
B004BH34HE|5|Not only is this chic and adorable, with fuzzy material, it is multifunctional. It hangs your purse (I have a huge packed Gucci tote that holds well), it also has a mirror. It also folds up so it doesn't add one more thing to your bag. Since it keeps your bag in your view and off the floor and has a mirror, and is adorable, it's a must have.
B009UZBF4G|5|I love it! Very original, good material, right size, regular fit, colors are as the ones in the stock photo and quick shipment.
B007P749HQ|4|I love to wear jumpsuits and immediately set my eye on it when I see it being simple and flattering to the body. I'm a typical size 4 and usually have no problem with the clothes ordered on line.  But this jumpsuit runs a bit small, although it fits me perfectly reason being the material is stretchable, but the belt is useless as it too small, more suited for size 0-2 than 2-4.
B00865EFPC|2|I only wore it once and hadn't even washed it yet before the material began to look &#34;old&#34; and &#34;worn&#34; on some spots. I wasn't even being active in it. Unfortunate. Cute shirt and good fit otherwise… but I would rather spend the money on a shirt that will last and look like I didn't buy it at a second hand store.
B008NYLIYC|5|Not too big and not too small. This along with my joker shirt really stand out among batman fans! Love this item
B00QKVNEZ6|2|Just not as comfortable and don't fit as well as my first pair (31 1/2 skinny, sans booty lift) . Legs and waist are bigger, waist is higher, and I have no idea what the booty lift technology is supposed to be, but I find no evidence of it.  Really disappointed.  Returned.
B00BLSRX6Y|5|I love, love, love this top, very sexy, very comfortable and the fit is great. Will always be purchasing from this seller because their clothing are always a great fit on me.
B002IU08GQ|4|very good product
B004B3DUP4|5|Bought this for a friend, and they absolutely love it. Perfect pattern, perfect fit.
B000WMA0A6|3|I'm returning this item.  I ordered XL as that is what my husband normally wears and it was way too big.  Also, the fabric is thick, seems heavy and like it would feel too hot.  I thought these shirts would be good for summer wear and a trip to the Caribbean, but after seeing them, I don't think so.  Other than that, the shirt seems well made.
B005Q0E104|5|The quality is not as comfortable as I expected it would be. But the design kicks ass. I love it.
B00M8RGA5M|1|It was at least 2 sizes too small and when I requested a refund they only offered me a 20% refund.
B00OUUQHF8|1|This shut is complete Not what I was looking
B00JANHB64|5|Great color, great value.  They fit well and don't ride up.  I highly recommended these.
B000S5XABI|3|I ordered a pair in my size but fit a bit small and just think i should buy it in a bigger size
B003H2CKHO|3|While it works, it does not seem like it is built to withstand a small child's abuse.  They just rip things off and throw them on the floor.  I am hoping this makes it through one rain season.  My son loves playing in it regardless and that is all that matters as he will outgrow it in a year.
B0030GEE9O|5|These are great
B001AK7EDU|5|I searched for a mini backpack for a long time before finding this and I just love it!  I have it in blue and use it for a diaper bag and purse.  I have 3 small children and find I can fit so much in here while not killing my shoulder like my old diaper bag did.  Mind you I have never been one to carry a huge diaper bag (always a mini one), but I can still fit my purse things in the first two pockets and then diapers, wipes (in a ziplock), changes of underwear for the older ones, snacks, little toys, my .75 L Camelbak water bottle, and a small camera in the main pocket. Then cell phone or sippy cups in the side nets.  Seriously, do you really need to carry anything more than that?  Plus all of the zippered pockets still keep my wallet away from my 15 mo old.  It is the perfect size for me and I highly recommend this!
B00MWWSGZ0|5|Such a cute top. This is a roomy 2T, and while other brands are too tight in the torso, this is nice and comfortable for my daughter.
B003JBIT9Q|4|I bought this shirt online because I went to ALL local stores looking for a WHITE polo shirt! I found this at a local store but they didn't have my size, but I loved the fabric and the lenght, so I decided to search it online. I was happy to find this shirt actually at a lower price that in the store! It fits perfect, the fabric is thick enough to wear it with no undershirt, it is shorter than in the picture but that's just right for me because I'm short. I ordered 2 and they arrived quickly, everything was ok, the only reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because they are not as white as the ones I saw at the store =( they look kind of old white to me. But I am overall satisfied and I would certainly buy again.
B00GPR4YHW|5|Great value for the money.  I have purchased their hiking shorts and they too are the steal of the century.  Lets see how they hold up
B00AE1YWNG|1|I have size 39 hips and it doesn't fit. It's baggy, ill fitting and the straps in the bag hang loose and useless.
B00FWNW8BO|5|These fit &#34;true to size&#34; for me (14).  They are comfy - they are not &#34;jean&#34; material if that's what you are looking for.  The material is thicker than I thought they would be - but they will be good for cooler weather.
B00JQ37T4M|5|Looks great!!
B008G51XA2|5|nice. I love it
B004LLDCDQ|4|These are great and fit nice
B00JXN3M5A|5|Not a Beanie fan, but love this one.  Fits great and is warm
B00J2DN7LK|4|Very nice. I bought them to wear over bras for low cut shirts etc and they seem like they will work perfectly
B0026A9T9A|5|Very cool belt buckle. Very heavy & great quality.  I really like it & it's a great gift for the trucker-girl enthusiasts.
B00SKQC66M|5|Great fit, excellent material, this is my fave
B00NAUNHY8|1|I didn't like the fabric they're too thin and they ripped in the crotch after a couple wears and I didn't even wash them yet
B005C9E8IY|1|Production description states that the jacket is 100% cotton... it's rather actually 100% polyester and it's really ugly. Feels and looks cheap. I never expected such a bad quality from Calvin Klein.
B00KCM87CE|5|Batman!!  It's an awesome shirt!
B00115G4U8|4|Arrived quickly.  I haven't worn it yet but it looks great.  I'd buy again for sure.
B001G88YKI|1|This product was incorrectly manufactured. The expansion waist was sewn shut so that the waist could not expand, The quality control was so poor that this major defect was not detected prior to shipment.
B00LPHC88O|4|Lovely panties but if you order the size you would normally wear you'll find that they are too large.  I always wear a size 8 but found that was one size too large.  They are easy to wash on the delicate cycle of your washing machine.  Lovely choice of pastel colors and such a sexy soft feeling while you're wearing them.  If you like to wear briefs you'll love these panties.  These panties are made in Haiti so why did the cost go up $5.00 for a three pack of panties.  I won't be buying Vanity Fair Ravissant panties again!
B0000VC1R4|5|My boyfriend loved the coat but it is too large.  I looked at his old jacket for the size but this one in much bigger.
B00S6R7L06|5|This shirt is great. Fits well, the material is super soft, and the colors are timeless. Simple from a distance and intricate up close. This shirt is sure to please.
B0060JJRU4|4|Not too tight. Size seems just right. I am happy. Seems to be pretty good quality. (purchased about 1 month ago) I dont know what the more expensive ones are like and if they truly dry instantly, but this one dries relatively quickly. It's not magic though as some reviews have expressed for some of the more expensive  rashguard tees. I would not be able to be completely dry at a bar or restaurant in this shirt 1/2 hour after swimming, but it does dry relatively fast. i do not know if this is better or the same as the expensive tees when it comes to how quickly it is dry. But it does not stick to my body,  which is good. Would buy again and might.
B000P8VQNC|2|They have not responded to my email about sending this back. Both are too small
B00IMIMZL4|2|Didn't really like the handkerchief. Thought it would be longer but it is not and material is too stiff.
B00EKG5O24|4|Very good quality. I have almost 6months using it and it has not fallen apart on me (a big plus).<br />It's very spacious, I can fit a 5-subject notebook, two textbooks and my laptop in it without a problem.<br />My only issue is that it looks a big to big on me, but that's because I have a small built. Other than that, It's the best backpack I've owned.
B00GCY5FDK|2|I received cars instead of animals.  The socks were otherwise nice and good quality.
B00T4ENT60|5|Beautiful dress, very well made
B00CAXQV3K|5|ok
B007TLJRI4|5|This pocket bib actually stays open and catches food...other ones just fold close.  Good material and stands the test of time.
B003OQTQ0C|5|Nice wallet!
B002D2YBS0|5|Living in Florida, skin protection is a must.This product is both stylish and works very well in covering the next and face. It wicks away the moisture and is great. I love the redfish pattern.
B000BIDG9S|5|Spanx gets all the glory but this shaper is AMAZING. I was a perfect fit and is made very well. I have put my finger through two pairs of Spanx pulling them up. Im so happy I can even wear these with jeans. I wear skinny jeans and the legs of these don't get bunched up like Spanx or others Ive tried. The boning is perfectly placed and comfortable! The first time I wore it I didn't take the garter clips off and I was mili-seconds away from cutting them but I realized they are removable. Will order another pair asap. Love them
B00DVQ92ZE|5|Exactly as advertised. I get positive comments every time I wear it.
B00M99QYOG|5|Hilar.
B00QPC4BHA|5|Great shirt love the dri fit material!! My son is 4 and usually can wear 3t and 4t and fits him great!! Fast delivery!!
B00OCLKCRO|3|The top fits as expected and is incredibly cute, but the shorts have basically no elastic. If not for the bulk of my granddaughter's diaper, the shorts would not stay on.
B003552QIQ|5|I am so happy with this purchase. I have searched high and low for this type of cami and was not able to find in any of my local stores (shopping malls). I highly recommend. The fit was exactly as it should be.
B004LTJ7D2|4|XL fits like other shirts of same size. The material is substantial.  I get lots of compliments on this shirt and everybody wants to know where I got it.
B008FODP4G|4|These were perfect for my daughter's 3rd birthday party which was tea party themed. The only problem was a few were received distorted in shape from shipping. I had two separate orders. The first shipment was perfect. The second shipment the hats were slightly folded up on the rims. Other than that, the little girls loved them!
B000I2T79U|5|Hi,to my opinion this is the best quality and coolest looking iron maiden purgatory shirt on the market today. Silk screening is superior in overall appearance,very comfortable to ware and very durable. T-shirt brand is made by one of the finest ever. Being afraid i would never see this design again i bought five copies three L and two XL.I have bought lots of iron maiden shirts in the past years back but,never seen the great quality the shirts of today have. The old vintage rages are not for me, thanks for this oppertunity to share,Ted.
B00GIT4M4C|5|Absolutely perfect color to match my gown.  It is lovely, delicate and the sequin pattern is eye catching and lady like.  Love the fringed edges as well.  The width and length is just right: enough coverage to be substantial but not overly encompassing.
B0099UDPX6|4|These are nice sports briefs, and I would give them 5 stars, if not for a superior alternative. They are very supportive, and stay in place, which is an absolute must for any sports brief. The fabric is cotton, which is also fine. When you compare them to the CSX76 (another Cocksox sports brief), the big difference is the fabric. The supplex fabric used in the CSX76 is more comfortable, stretchy, and attractive than the cotton. The enhancing feature of these briefs is nice and subtle- just enough, unlike what you will find with most other Cocksox underwear where the package sticks way too far out. The logo on the waistband reminds me of Joe Boxer a little bit, which is another reason why I appreciate the CSX briefs (subtle labeling). The colors/designs are fine, but the &#34;sniper&#34; is a little cartoony-looking in real life. These are good, but, like my other Cocksox reviews, I have to close by stating that the CSX76 are just better overall.
B00G2R4FI8|5|quality is wonderful, seems to be serving long time
B003H05TEC|5|Super cute and comfy :) Exactly what I needed!
B00KF80T3A|1|If you are wanting to wear this as a dress DO NOT ORDER its more like an over sized shirt, wide but very short there is no way to wear as a dress, and if you are going to wear as a shirt its wide so you might want to order down a size, I ordered one in each color and they were not at all what I was looking for I'm very disappointed and will be retuning, its too small for a dress but  fits somewhat large for a shirt.
B000C24GPQ|4|I love these things.  I can only give them four stars though.  Occassionally I have slid while wearing them.  I like to walk to work and I live in Wisconsin.  Well getting to work in the winter isn't too bad, there is enough sunlight to see where the ice is.  Walking home on the other hand it is dark.  However, I do not have to give up walking in the winter because I'm afraid of getting hurt.  I strap these bad boys on hold my head up and walk with confidence.  The cleats really are great, they are super easy to replace and they last a long time.  Let's see I walk 2.6 miles a day, 5 days a week and the cleats will last me about 4 months.  Of course that means I change them about once a year.<br />I have taken these hiking as well and I like them for trails that have become compacted ice and trails that are along water and are slippery.
B00HK7Z6W8|1|I purchased a small and it hung on me very unflattering.  The extra material at the bust was quite strange.  The material did not seem to be worth the price.  It was sent back.
B00BXX3GWW|4|I ordered these gloves for my fianc&eacute; in the long size instead of the super long size because we were concerned that the super-long gloves would be... well, too long.<br /><br />The description states, \\"19 inch super length from base of middle finger to hem.\\" But in fact they were just over 19 inches long from the TIP of the finger to the hem. Not from the BASE of the finger. In other words, 19 inches end to end. Which in turn makes them a good three inches shorter than the length indicated, and turns them into elbow-length gloves and not above the elbow length, which is what she wanted.<br /><br />These are wonderful gloves, but I'm adding this review so that anyone else uncertain about what to order get what they want.  I'm also knocking a star off because the product description is incorrect and I'm having to return them as a result.
B00HGJ420C|5|Nice breezy dress for summer
B00IYP7H72|5|My tiny girl child LOVES this jacket and we get do many adoring looks and compliments when we're out. I only wish the had it in my size!
B003QOVEC0|4|I was disappointed with color. Understanding irbid impossible to truly depict color given differences in viewing devices, I expected a deeper color. It was paler than I expected. A little faded looming.
B00ARDD7ZK|3|Our daughter is 16 months old and weighs a bit over 20 pounds. These onesies are tight both in the body and in the length. The material they are made from is thin and not as soft as I would have liked. I bought the 18 month size. They aren't going to fit her much longer!
B00HQE7LNM|4|Pretty, and conservative.
B00K34QCY6|5|It was short but what I expected
B008BJUUJS|5|I've run out of things to say about these shirts. I have ordered so many of them and I love them all. I think what I like best is the fabric and the colors. The designs are also very recognizable. I think these would make nice gifts for so some who has just about everything, because they don't have anything like this.
B00K7UWFNI|4|Great shirt with a retro vibe.  The material is comfortable, the fit is nice, and it looks like it's going to be low maintenance.  Be forewarned, however - the &#34;black&#34; shirt is grey, not coal black.
B005C9G88C|5|Got these for my husband,he says they fit the way they should and are comfortable,we didn't get any &#34;off&#34; colors (not that that would of mattered because for the most part he doesn't care what color his boxers are as long as their comfortable) I dunno if we were just lucky or what but worth the price I paid for them.
B0006U69KE|2|I liked these so much that I bought another pair. I rarely wear jeans but I wanted to have a couple of pairs for certain occasions. Well, with very light use, the arse blew out on one and the other pair the crotch fell apart. I am quite disappointed with Wrangler, these jeans had very little longevity even with light wear.
B00T576BH0|5|Very nice
B001DNHC3G|3|Purchased the Celtic Medley Shawl for a St. Patrick's Fundraiser I am hosting. It arrived quickly and in good shape. However, in the picture it looks like you will be able to fully wrap and drape the shawl as shown and it's impossible (and I'm of average build, not large). My own fault for not figuring out the measurements but I also feel the product picture is a little misleading - the form it is draped on must be a child's size. The material is thin cotton, less substantial than I thought, but I am fine with that. The pattern is pretty and the colors are bright and nice for St. Patrick's day but I am disappointed I will not be able to wear it the way I had hoped.
B00CDGO2SK|5|These are very comfortable socks, but unfortunately did not help with my blister issue.  Still a great sock and fits well.
B002OD6LDQ|4|This dress looks great!!!  My two year old is going to be a flower girl and this is perfect!  It fits great and looks great!  It's true - it isn't a high quality material, but I didn't want to buy an expensive dress for a two year old.  This is perfect!  :-)
B002C4K4W6|5|Not too heavy or stiff. Soft enough to wear without extra onesie underneath. My little one refused to wear the hat, but when she did, it was super cute and stood up straight just like the picture shows.
B00DZENXJS|5|Very sexy thank you
B0085Y4QS0|5|Well made product!
B005EVQ48W|5|I like the way it looks. Fits nice and has a lot of room for layering. It also has 7 pockets for convenience and with the baggy style nothing really shows.
B00HQ9GEUS|3|cute outfit
B006IYIQKS|4|product is good, just  took along time to arrive due to  wrong wt when being sent by UPS
B00GV3A4TM|3|Like brand and design, but would not purchase in the future. Fabric seems too thin...I like a more robust feel.
B004GZ3ADY|2|This hijab (described as new condition) arrived with much of the stitching not intact. This may have been a quality control issue as one I ordered from the same company in a different color and there was no problem with it, but this needed to be repaired before it could be worn.
B0027VT5SI|4|I am 5'1&#34; and 140lbs and I got a size large and it fits great! The dress is adorable but I don't like the apron (I think it is out of character) so I cut it off and it looks so much better. Without the apron, it is the cutest dorothy dress I have seen. And it's sexy without being slutty so my hubby is happy too!
B001JBNDLM|5|My husband loves the way these fit, and the quality is great. I bought him one package a couple of months ago. He liked them so much better than the brand he had been wearing, I bought another pack and he through out all the others. ( We aren't wasteful, they were getting pretty worn out anyway ). Seriously though, I will buy them again when he needs new ones.
B003VKT13S|3|Won't stretch or soften in the wash and are a little small. But price was good. Get what you pay for.
B001EDDHAM|5|Well made and they make socks fun!<br /><br />View tips and guidelines   13 more words required.  4 more words required.
B00BONNV3K|5|I bought this little onesie/tutu for my then two month old daughter. I was not disappointed! It looks EXACTLY like the photo and is true to size. We recieved many compliments on it, too!
B00HWOBQ9G|5|He loves them.  Thanks!
B00UL3UMI6|2|The shoe quality is as expected. Its a soft soul and thin material so the baby can walk easily. The stitching and quality is fine. However two major downfalls. First off the sizing is way off. I ordered a 12-18 month shoes and received a shoes that had tags for 9-12 Months. Needless to say the shoe did not fit. I contacted the company and they said the size they sent me was the largest one they own and that the size on amazon are just a suggestion. They ended up refunding me $2 and let me keep the shoe. (which is why i gave them 2 starts instead of 1) So I will have to use them on the next baby. Second is the shoe is similar to the pictures but NOT the same shoe. The color is a little more sandy then in the picture which is not a big deal but it also does not have the grips on the bottom of the shoe and its not a high top shoe it fits right under the ankle like all shoes.
B00817DZWO|5|Simple, basic, and a variety pack of colors, I like the pocket. At around $3 a shirt, a great deal. Ideal for work.
B00Q40MP9O|5|I love this phone case! I will buy again from this vendor!
B00L7QYEY4|5|The color wasn't as bright of a blue shown in picture -  but fit to size. Highly recommended
B00DXG9NRO|2|The t-shirt is very thin material and doesn't appear to be a man's shirt.  I ordered xl and should have ordered xxl for teenage girl!  Men's t-shirts make a nightgown on her, but this one won't!  Order larger size than you normally wear!!
B002K6F7CI|3|I love the comfort and ease of nursing.  However, if you're large chested, like me, you'll just fall out of it every time you bend over or sleep on your side.
B006C9DHLC|5|fit was good kids is a big fan amazing graphics all over durable and warm needs to be bought for 18 and older.
B0077DEGX0|5|Been needing some for a while. Glad I do me some that can fit.
B004E08MFW|5|I love all your men's clothes. You should have a store here in NYC. you keep up the nice designs!!
B00KSTNXRA|4|I wear a Large and I got an XXL and it fits exactly as I would have hoped. This is tailored so it's going to &#34;hug&#34; the body- I would definitely order a few sizes bigger than you are though. The quality is what I expected. The fabric is a nice weight so it doesn't so the unwanted curves of my larger upper body.<br /><br />overall, very satisfied and the shipping was quick! Gotta love that.
B005GYGEWS|5|I plan to wear these on a cruise to Europe...with a dressy top (Tunic). they are the most comfortable thing I own!  Have to get more!
B00P2Y2IL8|5|It fits right. It feels right. It looks right. It's the perfect match for my Captain Marvel shirt. All I need now is a blue Captain Marvel Jr. shirt.
B000A2KDQY|5|Great pants.
B0058CFIWU|1|there is no opening in the front.  I was looking to replace my Elite Boxer Briefs.  I thought this was it.  I was wrong.  If I want workout briefs, I'll wear compression shorts and not cotton-esque briefs.  Bad idea.
B00V87OK5U|5|Very cute top, fits great!
B010CRVRXO|5|Very cute outfit. I think I ordered a large and it was still bordeline too short too little! So go 2 sizes up.
B00CPKYZ9A|5|just how i want it
B0066SJPD8|5|Was a little big for my smaller than average head, but the hat is easily adjusted with the inner drawstring.  The wool is warm and classy looking.  Well made for the price.
B00N50AXQ8|5|You're reading these reviews to find reasons this may not fit right, or stand up to the wear and tear children will place on it (ages 1-93!)<br /><br />Rest assured, a medium will fit fast and tall growing teens, and below that lanky threshold size down carefully.<br /><br />Note! The Shield emblem on the back is surprisingly higher quality than appears. It's in fact NOT a sticker or steam pressed variant, but a sewn on, raised, ridged &#34;merit badge&#34; like stronger feature that makes the sword/shield backside appearance and longivity the more special!<br /><br />I'm 31. Wearing this outdoors would be highly nerdy... but its comfy well constructed design makes this a must on the many chilly Chicago nights indoors gaming!
B0094VJWWS|3|Lace is stiff even after hand washing it. I have not had a chance to try it on yet. But it looks as if it will fit just right. We do like the looks of it.
B00NPORRFE|5|They are awesome, my daughter loves them!
B00A60XJ5C|5|I bought for my granddaughters christmas dress she loved it and it looks lovely.  I would highly recommend this top
B00JEQ2O1Y|5|These are great socks at an affordable price. Very comfortable and they feel like they'll last a good long while. I recommend them.
B00A1OPLM2|5|I love this shirt! It's more of a dark blue than the picture but I think it's even better! Fits like a glove which is how I like my shirts to fit. Happy with my purchase.
B00NQN83S4|2|Using their chart still end up with a very small shirt
B002XM7CC2|5|i really loved this order. its very sturdy and dosent look cheap. i would recommend this to any bleach fan out there.
B007E56MA6|1|I am extremely disappointed. The zipper broke after just one wear. I paid $30 for these jeans and now they are garbage. The jean also does not run true to size. Very disappointed.
B00DJ24322|4|Great under a black blazer, over a pencil skirt, or for any piece where you need something more than casual clothes.  I love mine, and since its a more classic piece, I can wear it for years to come.
B00BGXJ9TI|5|Good quality, nice shirt
B009G16FB2|5|Elegant and high quality ties for 1/3 the price of those in men's clothing stores.
B00OPX8G2W|3|I like it. It's a really neat shirt this so called &#34;second&#34; neck hole is nothing but a second layer of material to give it the baggy look. Shift it under the collar just right and you can't tell the front panel is two layers. It's a little big on me but I still wear it. I will be ordering a smaller size
B005OLJFTC|4|These are great socks for dressing up or at the office, but if you intend to actually walk around all day in them good luck. They are just a little too thin for my everyday needs.
B00N5KNV4Y|4|I purchased this for my 7 yr old daughter to wear at her Christmas school performance. She LOVED it and her brown hair contrasted the dress beautifully. I would imagine a fair skin light haired child would look washed out in this color dress.<br /><br />My personal issue is that the sequins were coming off after just one wear.  She has worn it again and nobody noticed the few missing pieces here and here. In fact she will wear it a third time to a father daughter dance coming up. I purposely picked this color because it worked for Christmas yet could be used for spring.<br /><br />And the bottom line is my daughter loves it and feels beautiful in it.
B00LP2W04G|1|The shirt is cute enough but way smaller than advertised.  I would put this in the XS/S category of US sizing.  It barely fit and was way to short in the length.  I am 5'9&#34; and I say if you are above 5'4&#34; - 5'6&#34; and don't have a petite frame, I wouldn't waste your time ordering this.<br /><br />Not an easy return either... I emailed the company to return.  They wanted my measurements before they would give me any info on returns/refunds.  If it doesn't fit it doesn't fit.  I shouldn't have to send measurements.  I know what size I buy in the stores.
B00NPEGLH4|5|I adore this little case.  The key word being &#34;little&#34;.  However, I am trying to travel with a carryon only, so I needed a makeup bag that was small in size but big on organization.  First off, I love train case style bags.  I don't use the brush holders to hold brushes because I carry my brushes in a travel brush cup holder.  So I use those spots to hold my mascara, lipstick and pencils.  The amount of space is limited, but I like it because I have found traveling with less means less stress.  It is big enough to hold my tarte powder foundation, concealer, hourglass blush trio, benefit bronzer, mascara, brow gel, eyebrow pencil, Urban decay naked basics eye shadow, a maybeline color tattoo pot, a lipstick and a lip liner.  It is NOT big enough for any of the larger urban decay naked palettes lorac pro palettes.<br />The jewelry side is just as you see in the photos.  It's a soft suede like material with plenty of organization for smaller pieces of jewelry.<br />I was plesently surprised by the quality of the nylon on the exterior.  I bought the magenta and the color is true to the photo.
B00OP7IHPY|5|As described,well packed and fast shipping! Thanks!
B00AOLNHBO|1|WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!. i EXPECTED A LITTLE SHRINKAGE BUT NOT TWO SIZES. ALSO THE CUT IS JUST TERRIBLE. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY TOOK A BARREL AND WRAPPED SOME FABRIC AROUND IT THEN ADDED SO SLEEVES LATER. A BUTTONHOLE  IS STARTING TO UNRAVEL AND IT HAS ONLY BEEN WASHED ONCE. CARHARTT HAS REALLY GONE DOWNHILL SINCE I PURCHASED MY LAST SHIRT.<br />SO GOES THE WAY OF ANOTHER AMERICAN TRADITION. I SURE WON'T BE BUYING ANYMORE OF THEIR JUNK IN THE FUTURE. i QUIT BUYING THEIR WORK PANTS LONG AGO BECAUSE THEY DON'T LAST MORE THAN 6 MONTHS.<br />IF YOU HAVE TO BUY ASIAN CRAP YOU CAN PAY A LOT LESS THAN CARHARTT PRICES AND GET A BETTER PRODUCT. HAROLD SHAY
B00B4ETHD2|5|This was exactly what I was looking for to do some face painting for a costume. It's very smooth and the color is nice and bold (I bought the \\"Red\\"). I set it with the Mehron Colorset Powder and it should stay put without too much smudging or running.<br /><br />Edited 2014/02/10<br />The cream was easy to apply, very vibrant, and stayed put very, very well with the Mehron Colorset Powder and some cheap hairspray over that. Did not smudge (too easily) or run, but I wouldn't recommend using it without the powder and spray to make sure it sets, or you're going to have a huge mess. It also washed off very easily in the shower after rubbing some olive oil over the areas I painted (face and shoulders) to loosen it all up and make it easier to wash off with a soapy rag. Did not leave any staining, which was great considering I used RED.
B00NH69X2K|3|A bit tight and thicker than I expected
B00LVSNHOG|5|Beautiful! Thanks
B00DR1EZ6Y|5|This is my first review of an item on Amazon EVER and I have been shopping on here for a while. I'm a big guy and have always gone through a lot of belts as the only ones that really fit my style, need at the time, and my waste size have always been the dickies reversible belts and they never seem to last. Took a shot on this belt and was NOT disappointed. This is the BEST belt that I have ever worn. It fits well. It's looks good. It has the cool and easy ratchet feature.<br /><br />I 100% recommend this belt to everyone. Fantastic.
B00LTPSFGQ|1|They are cheaply made and the writing on the back is grammatically horrible. It say &#34;Ne&#34; instead of &#34;Me&#34; and &#34;arround&#34; instead of &#34;around&#34;.... Come on you guys have the internet!
B00QMG057E|5|Love these white and olive Camo leggings. My first item in this particular print. This fabric is shiny but offers a great stretch. They have been washed once and held their shape great. I did not run then through the dryer, though you may be able to.
B000PQE56O|5|The hat was a perfect fit. It matches my military long coat and looks good on me
B00HMJ0LHY|5|Very nice warm wool jacket. Sleeves are a bit snug with heavy shirt on, but fits well otherwise.
B00B2G16R2|4|great for workday wear
B003XRNMU2|5|The hat was a perfect fit and very warm.<br />Would recommend to anyone, male-female.
B00EVVX5H4|3|I usually wear a size 6 or a small, and these fit well for me.  I imagine they will stretch for people who wear slightly larger sizes, but not a lot more.<br /><br />They are fairly warm, but they were also a little bit itchy until I had washed them several times.  The other negative is that the reinforced crotch runs from side to side, not back to front as is usual.  This means the crotch didn't fit snugly, which was made worse when I wore another pair of pants over them (I like to wear leggings instead of long underwear in winter).<br /><br />For the right price, these can be a good buy, but I wouldn't pay very much for them.
B00LA2480K|4|Awesome but somewhat smaller them the other XXL eleven Paris shirts I purchased.
B007GB5VZA|5|So cute.  I bought this as a gift for a relative and it's soft and the quality looks good.  It is on the smaller end of the 6-12 month size.  I have a chubby niece about 20 lbs and it was a little too snug.  I'm planning on giving it to another friend because it is high quality, soft and a good price, so it'll make a great present.
B00OMDKLUK|5|I wear between a 13 and 17 in pants depending on the brand and these fit comfortably. They are very stretchy and super soft!
B008JG0QUQ|4|The product is really soft and comfortable. It fit fine, but the feet werent quite right. It seemed like they were sewn on backwards. A little home repair fixed the problem though.
B000J196CI|5|For those cold winter days around the house there's only one thing better than a warm pair of sox, and that's a warm pair of slipper sox.  This is especially true if you have hardwood floors and don't want to slip and fall.<br /><br />I ordered this 3-pack as a replacement to a previous pair; they are indeed nice and warm, and the non-slip tread on the bottom works really well.  I've washed them and they have held up well.  My only (minor) complaint is that I wish they came up higher on the leg; they just cover the top of the ankle.
B003AVM7CA|5|These 36/32 fit perfectly. Definitely true to size. No problems with the rise, great fit. Sharp pants, look great with my husbands black suit jacket. Good quality, not the cheap stretchy polyester old man pants. Very nice!
B000VD2XWO|1|This product is really expencive, and when I asked about the quality of the masks. I was told it was sturdy. It's not sturdy and it's a giant balloon head! It looks like it's made for King Kong's head! I'm Very disappointed! The price is way too high at $ 126.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00JE3016C|5|I like these socks so much that I have just ordered another pack of them.  They are soft, cozy, breathable, and fit me just right--roomy but not droopy.  We have hard, cold floors with no carpet, so I wear socks all day.  The listing says these socks fit shoe sizes 10-12, however my shoe size is 7-1/2 or 8-wide.  I always buy extended size socks because I like all my clothing to be roomy; I can't stand anything tight.  These socks are stretchy so I expect they would also be comfortable for feet larger than mine.
B00JW2A8I6|4|Everything is good except that it came with awful smell. My whole closet is filled with that horrible smell.
B000C7KFVU|5|Using these for years now and like it. Still have two I bought in 2012, surely they look a bit older than new ones, but still very good (well above what I would call just 'acceptable'). Care properly, and you'll enjoy.
B009T6IPO4|5|Great fit for a plus size. Would definitely buy again. No see through lines under clothes. Smooth fit under clothes.
B00B6EA8II|4|A little tight at the in seams
B005OFLSR0|5|Soft and durable.
B00LYW9N7O|5|So cute.
B0031U0Q9G|5|I recently lost a lot of weight because of health reasons, and I needed a new belt to both hold up my britches and not look too horrible in the process.....  I bought this same belt larger, and then a smaller one, and I think they are well made and decent-looking, functional accessories.  I have been pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I'm not a mechanic, but I am a guitar player, and I've always had a bit of a belly.  These Carhardt belts don't scratch my guitars, are comfortable, low-key, and well made.  That's about everything I could ask for in a belt.
B00FAWJQAS|5|So  nice .
B0009DR4HK|5|excelent, 185 cm and 87 Kg
B005GGQZ0M|5|Perfect match for my bride's dress.  Good quality tie, even some nice comments about tie from guests!
B001BHXMYW|4|The trousers were too slim fo my 14 Year old grandson who is really skinny. Hope they will fit his younger cousin
B000JL8ZA2|3|Looks good not very good quality though.
B00960Q9UU|5|Wonderfully priced and perfectly fit. Great dresses for kids living in the warm climate they are light and easy to was also.
B00PJ3BIC2|5|Hopefully my review will help others on what size to get. I ordered large: 5&#34;5 and 128 lbs, Asian.  I am very happy with my size decision since I want a little room for a T shirt or thin long sleeve. The material is soft and color is as it describe on the description. I am glad I did not get medium since it would've been snug and others are right, the neck hole would've been too tight.
B002HWDWUO|4|This is a great jacket.  My Husband loves it.  It is the perfect thickness and provides the proper amount of warmth.  The only problem with it is that the lining feels odd in the arms because it makes one feel like it's a little snug- but he got used to it very quickly and it's his favorite jacket.
B00GJS3AI6|3|I liked the material, and the felt comfy. I am 5'-9&#34;, and as described by several posts they would fit similar to what is shown in the picture. when wearing them, the legs are coming down just about the bottom of my calf, or in measurements, it is 9&#34; or 23 cm above my ankle. I am getting creative, and purchasing some fabric to have sewn. It will be a two tone, and who knows, maybe it will set a new trend. Overall, they are good, just a bit short.<br />Delivery, it was to me in about about 7 days from ordering. Coming from overseas, I thought that was truly outstanding!
B0075GW62C|1|Good
B00BV64Q4I|5|Great product!
B00EOYKEEA|4|I wouldn't trust the piece of leather that is supposed to hold bills.  You'd need quite a few for the money to fit tightly.  It holds cards just fine.  I have 7 cards and it works well.
B00CALVWUY|5|There were a lot more expensive dresses out there but I bought this one based on price and previous reviews. For the price, the quality is excellent. The dress fits perfectly. Design is beautiful. Not overly heavy. Will need a over-breast corset if you are a larger busted woman since the dress is not boned. Will also need a petticoat to achieve the fuller look of the dress as it is not sewn-in.
B008JRTXUY|2|Do not buy unless you're a pregnant elephant. Odd, the liner fits just right...
B00D17B936|1|You can't see it in the picture, but when you put it on your sides show, so the sides of the dress are completely see through. I didn't like the way it made my body look. I'm small (5'2 1/2) I love showing off my curves, but this wasn't what I expected at all.
B002K8PC4O|3|We purchased from Amazon LLC the Adventure BanZ Baby Sunglasses as a gift for our new grandson.  The pkg arrived at his home yesterday without a packing slip and without the gift card enclosed showing that we sent the gift.  Out son and daughter-in-law were trying to guess who had sent the gift and it wasn't until we spoke on the phone that the mystery was solved.  We should not have to explain a gift and it should not have been sent without even a packing slip.  Very disappointed in Amazon, but very happy with the quality of the sunglasses.
B006NZPZ8I|4|Wonderful I use them all the time
B00BYV5TEG|5|Love it!  Well-made, looks great. I received more order promptly. I would recommend this to anyone who is a S.O.A. fan.
B005WPRXIA|5|This scarf is soft and cozy, but not scratchy. It was just the right length to double up.  Thanks so much...great Christmas gift!
B008AGW2Y8|4|This id one of my daughter's favorite outfits. Looks very sweet. I was happily surprised that it survived a few rounds of laundry, even though the black bow on the shirt is about to come off. Overall, a nice outfit, but not greatest quality.
B007PQMMS0|5|&#34;Hey, I like your shirt!&#34; Its something we all love to hear, especially from our &#34;tribe&#34;. It blows my mind how many people have NO CLUE what this shirt is all about but for those of us Snake Plissken fans, its awesome. Shirt fits great, great quality t-shirt material. The downside is that now I have the overwhelming desire to wear an eyepatch!
B006PHUR3C|4|Read all the reviews and picked this one and I am pleased.  Sufficient room and clasp is sturdy. Good buy
B00IRUFVFO|5|I gave it 5 stars, for this price you can't really complain. It's well made but you can tell by the material that it will start to fall apart after repeated washing. I bought it for my daughter's kindergarten graduation. Something special for her to wear on her special night! As soon as she saw it, she loved it!!!
B00H2Y2EW4|5|I love this dress. The cutouts on the side of the dress are tasteful and show just enough skin. The dress isn't too short and the material is slightly stretchy as well as comfortable. I always get compliments on this dress when I wear it. This is one of my favorite dresses
B00U8LRFZO|4|Ordered these in a S/M and they fit pretty much as expected. I am 5' 5&#34; and weigh about 110. They do feel a bit loose, but don't look it when I'm wearing them. I prefer my clothes to not be squeezing me anyhow, so this is good. The material is kind of a stretchy spandex, so they will give some.<br /><br />They have lots of different patterns to choose from, which I really liked. I will probably be ordering more in different colors.<br />Overall, I think it's a decent product at a fair price.
B0085IT7OO|2|Gave it 2 stars because its not that warm. Bought it for my son. Its true to size, love the color and its cute, but why isnt there any fur in the inside? Its all on the outside and the inside has no warmth. Not that it isnt warm at all, but its not as warm as i expected it to be. Kinda disappointed, but maybe i should have read the description of the product instead of just relying on pictures
B00UO0H590|5|As described
B002NPCILO|2|Ordered the size 2-4 for  2 year old. Fit just right with no room to grow.  Sizes are much smaller than normal.
B002LSI31M|4|This was my first pair of Dickies, and I got them with the hopes they'd hold up well with time. As it's only been a week, I can't promise anything, but I can say they're made of a very sturdy material. They seem to be durable and longlasting. The size that I ordered seemed smaller than I was used to, so I went up a size and it's fine now. The service was great, even when I exchanged the product, and the shipping was on time.  If I had a complaint, it would be that they're not too soft. Like I said, they're very durable, but are a tad scratchy. Maybe this will be fixed with more washing, but for now that bumped it down to 4 stars.
B00KCNBF2M|4|Great product!
B00B4YBZ6E|5|I LOVE this shirt. THe colors are vivid, it fits well, and has gotten a lot of compliments.
B0012N4VTK|5|The thinness and lace give a sexy look to the bra. It is a perfect fit as a 36D, offering full under-wire support.  There is hardly any marking of the bra when wearing a pull-over or snug T.  I love it!
B00F6FHEDA|5|This product does a good job supporting my back and taking the pressure off of my hips. I'm 28 weeks and wearing it almost every day. However it's too long for my 5'4 frame so I have bunch up the bottom. Otherwise I think it's worth the money to be comfortable during my third trimester.
B00M89K14G|4|I was pleased to see how well it fit me. There is very nice hand lace touch on the shoulders. I haven't worn it yet or washed it, since the weather turned very warm where I live. But I am satisfied with the purchase.
B0051CMGFE|5|I love the adjustable strap. They fit everyone from my 9 month old son to an 8 yer old. All of the parents loved them too.
B00V2QWIUG|3|Runs small
B00IXPF34C|4|cool jeans
B008DKC98U|5|super comfy and awesome design that has yet to fade after over a year of regular wearing
B0048ZG1CO|5|Awesome color and very soft and warm.  Its plenty long for those taller people who want a scarf.  You wont regret it.
B00UFJYTBW|5|Fit perfectly and and material was good. Wear it all the time!
B00AJLLNRO|4|These was to small for my husband so i just have them for myself i wear them, they fit good on me an i make them look like women jeans :) :) look good on me!!
B000A2K9MW|3|A little smaller than other pants I've bought in same size. Also I wish it had a cell phone pocket on the right leg.Also I do not like the way the pants fold after washing. Maybe these were irregulars.
B00WA164XY|2|I'm 37&#34; waist and bought it XXL black cincher, it fit somewhat small, but the material listed on the website said Latex and the one I received said material rubber in a label inside the chincher. the material is not like the one described on the website is very stiff and uncomfortable to wear even a few minutes, you can not bet or sit. My friend is 32&#34; waist bought it L black cincher and experience the same as me.We return the product.
B00CBAYRK6|5|PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!
B0045AO92G|1|Ordered largest available and they are way to small, nearly impossible to put on. My shoe size is a 13
B00A3I5BUI|5|Nice shorts! The color looks even better than that shown in the picture!
B00C3AC2BU|5|Perfect fit. Love the material it's on the thicker side so it's not see through at all. I got the black one and I love it. I also wear this to work out in because the fabric feels like the dry fit material.
B006UESJP8|1|The first two times the sock was great! Here's my problem now. For some reason around the toe area on the sock the material has become like dry/hardend after several times of use. This now causes torture to my toes! Very uncomfortable for me. My wife got me a new pair of work socks which I currently do not have the name but their the thicker wool kind for winter. They have been working wonderful so far after several times of use. I also am having the same problem with the Steel Toe Cotton version of these socks. Bites because I never had problems with Carhartt's products before.
B00GYSKXH2|4|I am very pleased with my jumpsuit. It took a really long time to be delivered but it fits perfectly.
B00M1HMWR4|3|a little too much padding and the straps are a little thin considering the size of the cup
B00AP7JM7A|5|This an amazing wallet was not late it came right on time and is very useful and will fit all of your wallet needs.
B00ZG9WE4U|5|FINALLY AT GREAT SKINNY TIE CLIP!!!! Quality is great, especially for the price. The springs are sturdy in each clip and should last for a long time. I would definitely recommend these tie clips, they look very professional.
B00C9RMHIA|5|This Assassin's Creed logo for the BLACK FLAG title is by far my favorite to date, The shirt was as expected the fit was right and the image was as good as any other printed shirt I buy.<br /><br />No complaints, shipped & arrived on time.
B00THGVRF0|5|The fabric is so comfortable and it fits like a glove! Beautiful dress as well.
B009Q2EEA0|4|Three Dots makes very good tops and I also bought this in yellow.  I am very happy as it washes well and the color has not faded.
B00LFJ7ASK|5|with all the 'puffy' coats out there, this one has real style
B006ZZU4UK|5|Love It!
B006YFUX16|5|These comfortable pants have lasted me a good couple of years. I had received them from a coworker, because they didn't fit, and these have been my favorite pants to wear.  I prefer the elastic waist to drawstring and the pants have always stayed up.
B00JE7289Q|4|Too big in the bust but I have a small bust so it's ok. I expected it. I bought it for a base for a cosplay
B005P25JGS|2|I should have read more.  I am sure this product would work with someone who had only posture issues.  I have a bad shoulder and this shirt was impossible to put on because of it.  I was looking for more of a brace but with the wearability of a shirt.  The quality of the shirt was very good, but it was small.  I ordered a large and an extra large would have been better.  So, my advise is to order one size larger than you normally would.  If you are like me, with a very painful shoulder, this product is impossible to use.
B00LD0ULDC|4|I am surprised for the fit as an extra large ... being a little snug ... one thin shirt worn underneath no thick sweaters possible
B001UEQUTK|1|The point of tie was off-centered / not symmetrical. Not off by just a little bit, but a lot. Fabric is pretty cheap too, but hey, $5 tie.
B00IPKMDZM|4|I always use these briefs but I have lost weight so I changed size.  The previous were medium and they feel to large so I bought small which now feel somewhat small.
B00GA9F95G|4|Got compliments the 1st time i ever wore it.  I'm a bigger guy 6'1 225 and muscular.  I ordered a XXL and it fit as i expected.  The arms were not as snug as i thought they were going to be and the quality is very good.  I will be ordereing more of these henley's.  Definitely not for those without a flattering physique, slim fit is an exact description
B00QDWD9NO|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE ! Sexy nice shoe and the heel height is perfect for the office --&#62; to happy hour. Such a classic look and what a great price! I will get more colors now!<br /><br />The only bad thing I can say about them is there isn't much toe room. My toes are scrunched but I can live with that ;)
B009P2LP9E|5|Bought this as a gag gift, and it back fired. The socks are very comfy and keeps your feet warm.<br />Highly recommend them either as a gag gift or just to be different around the house.<br />Excellent product.
B00O0FWU54|3|I will not buy from them again. This item is not worth the $300 it stated as the regular price.
B00CO5FLPS|5|My husband has the build of a football player with broad shoulders and narrow hips.  This shirt was nice and vibrantly colored, and fit just as expected!
B00OV3JF94|1|Bad quality, I thought it to trash
B009F6HRTW|5|Perfect fit. Very comfortable.  They stay up on my leg and don't roll down like other socks.
B004SLKRXC|4|These are a nice material with pretty lace at the top. Mine do not have any rubber or elastic in them though, as noted in other comments, so they do slip down a little bit and do not stay up perfectly.
B011HATEVW|5|Perfect!
B00O5I1WF0|5|Very comfy.
B007AM2Z8G|4|Just got the belt in and put it on my child.  It fits and can be adjusted easily and and since its elastic lots of room for him to grow.
B004AS3TJM|5|Pleasantly surprised to see so many pockets. My husband immediately transferred his stuff from his old wallet into the new one. He is more than happy with it. It appears to be well made and comfortable to pack around in his back pocket.
B0073GRY9O|5|Perfect for a small adult. Flowy high-low style is forgiving and comfy, the pattern is cute, the arms/neck fit me perfectly, and the stitching adds a bit of interest when people take a closer look. I'm glad they have such nice clothes for kids that they can pass for regular clothes on me!
B00IAYI3X4|5|I wasn't sure of the size I needed, so I got a large and x-large. Both will work. I usually where a 7 3/8. Added bonus was the snap on the sides to lift the side up if not needed.
B003HP4TXO|5|was a little shorter than I expected...but still beautiful
B00TPRJUX2|4|Fantastic fit as advertised
B007R6JPC4|5|Very reliable bookbag.
B0029NZZWO|1|How do I return my items
B00BHBGEBK|3|The shirt was very pretty and quality seems fine; however,the shirt is sized very very small.  I would suggest you consider these junior sizes.
B004ZVPZW8|5|nice!
B002RIJW4S|5|Got this for my husband, who always likes to have a cloth hanky handy. The pattern is really pretty, the quality of the cotton is good and sturdy, and it can take a hot wash without any problems.
B00DBJ73Z2|1|This top runs very large and is rather shapeless. I would not recommend it.
B002HJ377A|5|Okay I'm sittin in my girl's trailer right? I'm checking through her email when I see she has amazon minimized on her computer. She's lookin at some dumb old engagement ring and I'm like lookin at some T shirts for my next trip to a nascar race when I see this bad boy. I'm like !/$# thats a sweet shirt. I buy it with her credit card along with some other stuff and get next day delivery. When It come to my pad I am so totaly stoked, it's better than I could imagine. So excited by the shirt I put it on with some ripped up tight jeans with \\"BANGER\\" on the back and I had in to my local Speedee mart  to pick up some Shakin'bake and Heiny for a fancy home cooked meal with my girl Trixie.
B00G3KQ4II|3|Looks nice<br />Bought for a 6 yr old who wears sz7 shorts- these were too large
B00LUII044|5|GOOD!GOOD!GOOD!
B00GHXWSSQ|5|I love the hat.  It came quick and was so cute under the tree.  Love it and will have it for many years to come.
B00J5OM3O8|5|Good fit and quality. I would buy these again.
B008AQCKOK|3|I am a 6 foot 6 210 pound guy.  So normally I don't mind when shirts run a bit big, or that I even have to step up to an XL size.  However, I probably could of ordered a Medium for the first time since high school and gotten away with it on this purchase.  The shirt itself is great, but I have to tuck it in so it doesn't look like I am wearing a sailboat sail.  Maybe I will order another one in a size smaller since I washed it, hoping it would shrink some, which it did, but only slightly.  .
B0050K7HGA|5|My bf loves it
B00BGEVMF6|5|This is the best compression and fit if you need the garment to come closer to the waist.
B00WW0XS5K|2|First the fringe was way shorter then pictured and no where near as thick. The bottoms are very oddly cut and kinda of remind me of the 80s high waist cut ( kinda like what Miley wears now). It was like the top didnt come up high enough and the thigh holes went up way to high. I even had friends try it on to make sure it wasnt my body being weird. While the whole suit was a no for me it was nice that the top actually fit my chest so i will be pairing it with different bottoms and removing the fringe.
B00Q2GM8MY|1|this was too small it is more like a 2 x.  There is a split in the back that you cannot see from the picture and the material feels and looks cheap.  I like to picture and was excited waiting for it and so disappointed when it finally arrived which took forever
B00J7BDG5O|5|Super cute top.  Great with leggings or jeans.  I'm always skeptical of ordering online because of my size and this was a winner.
B006V2VES8|5|This shiny shirt is a great lightweight tee for any Firefly fan.  Shows off my nerdy style, fits well and is comfortable.  A shiny purchase :-)
B00NAJF0T4|5|I can ware alone with tunic or an added layer under jeans doesn't feel bulky or uncomfortable<br /> Thicker than tights but thinner than jeggings. Nice to have a choice. Plan to order more colors.
B00BPIMU2M|5|The person yo whom I gave it to loves it.
B003DPP090|5|Nice hat and fit prefect
B00N3YIESU|4|It fits nice on me and I'm broad shoulders accept the sleeves do sometimes come upa bit but I don't mind it and it ssuper comfy ^-^
B00HHIF59O|4|Something big in the bust part , and a bit long compared to the picture but I loved it .
B00PY4V16O|4|This shirt is really cute. Fits kind of big and loose. I would definitely recommend you buy a size down if you don't want it to be baggy.<br /><br />WARNING: The model is wearing the shirt backwards. The buttons are supposed to be worn on the back.
B00JBXXEY6|4|gr8
B00QJ5TNEY|1|Very thin &#34;fabric&#34; and the sole is not able to be worn outdoors
B00AM22ENM|2|I bought several pairs of these shorts earlier this year, and, despite their listed size consistencies, the shorts all fit completely differently.  Most of the shorts fitted just as I expected them to, given the waist size, but this pair (although it has a size 34 tag), was several sizes too small.  It the return was worthwhile, I would have returned them, but, given the price and time cost, it wasn't worth it.  Just be cautious of the size differences between the styles.
B00E99KY6S|3|I'm 5'2 and 108 lbs.  I wear a size 4 pant usually so I ordered a small.  I was disappointed that the fit was a little snug and the &#34;strings&#34; actually press a little too tightly in on my hips.  They work, they're not uncomfortable, so I'll keep them but wish I would have known.
B004XFOY14|5|The quality is great - soft yet sturdy material and snaps are easy to handle. It's nice that they have snaps all along the front instead of simply at the bottom like some half-length rompers have. That way, I don't have to struggle to get them over my son's head while putting on and taking off.   I love that it's so colorful; a pleasant change from the monochromatic blues and greens found in most baby boy clothes.
B00N8PNKFQ|1|Super thin. Way too small. I am a size 10-12.
B00II58FNI|5|Love my tops but black one sheds the rubber strings bad. Was quick ship an great to deal with
B005GYGEWI|5|Will order more - hopefully next time from exercising I'll order a smaller size!  Received within time frame with no issues.
B00OAQBULS|2|All hair ties were the exact same color & design, not thrilled with the item.  It wasn't even a polka dot design, it was stripes.
B001FOR4P4|5|An excellent multi-purpose belt.  You can wear it with anything of any color.
B00JUM3BJQ|5|A simple, warm, well fitting sweatshirt that is perfect for the gym. That is what I was looking for and with this sqweatshirt that is what I received.
B00APORILK|5|I love this underwear. The cloth and elastic used is top notch. I know, I know it's just underwear. But these are well made and comfortable. Will buy more.
B00BTKX412|5|By far, the best boxer briefs I have worn.
B000HAPK8A|3|Got this for my lady who is 5'6 and it's a bit small. It's still baggy...but not like the photo. The person in the photo must be like 5'. Did the job and was okay though.
B007TX99BW|3|I purchased this shirt and was disappointed with the quality. I had gotten one similar 20 Years ago that was 100% wool. This one is 80 cotton 20 wool. which makes the quality much different than I thought. and also it was suppose to be new  and the sleeves were rolled up as if it was a return or display item.It's ashame how the quality has changed so much from such a well known company.
B00UDN0CUC|5|Great fit & very comfortable . Love it !
B0091W66FG|5|My sister in-law has these for my nephew and they are amazing!  They definitely do the trick at keeping the little guy's socks and booties in place!  I bought these for all my friends that are expecting.
B000N8X2YU|5|Great Purchase
B00HQZ3BX0|5|Husband loves it
B00JMPCQ0G|5|good gift
B00606NKI2|5|Repels water and looks great.  This good looking jacket is perfect as a windbreaker for general use or when playing golf.
B005HX5C3U|5|Buckle is exactly as described.  Very solid piece but not extremely heavy.  I can't wait for my belt to come in to complete this. (Making my own belt.)
B00G9GYUFA|5|I read the advices of other buyers before ordering. S/M size fits well although I am rather bigger size altogether. Large would be too big for me. This is a nice hat, I like it.
B00LHJGG3I|4|Cute pants, only downside is that the dots on the knees and back of the pants seem to have worn off quickly.
B00DQYX0U4|4|I usually wear an L, but according to the sizes on Columbia's website, I should be an XL instead. I fit into an L just fine. I like the coral color, though it is a little see through and crinkly.
B00LCUVO3Y|5|EA makes good underwear. much better than CK and on par with Diesel and Hugo. More please.
B00KFWDHMQ|2|slides all over the place, if you are comfortable naked, then you'll be fine
B00IJKRDA8|5|Perfect!
B00BF0MAXO|5|Great pants for work -- like this style much better than other docker styles. Nice back pocket details.  I will leave the front pockets stitched closed to avoid gapping.  Nice fabric - Very flattering.
B00JSVRV68|4|Nice material just hard to put on
B00EQV0AQS|4|somewhat tight but a great shirt and cool graphics
B007IDM81Q|2|I was hoping it would be like my american apparelly t-shirt polos.  It's not.  Feels cheap and I don't wear it.
B0007CKMZY|4|works as described
B00ODD3QHE|5|I am absolutely in love with these! I am 5'6&#34; and 145 pounds and bought a large, but I do have a fairly large butt. They fit perfectly. I will be ordering another pair soon.
B00PTEX71G|1|Bad quality
B007TPHD5E|5|i love my slidebelt.  i think i have had this belt for 2 years now and it still looks brand new.  i love the fact that it doesn't have those stretched leather look like the traditional belts.  also the metal is nickel free and i don't get rashes from it.
B00HRJXA6S|2|I had to return these shorts because they were too small.  I ended up buying another brand in size 6 and they ran quite a lot bigger. I bought Kanu Surf Women's Oceanside Board Shorts in size 6.  They are a little big but for exercise I think they will be fine.  I'm 5 feet tall and weigh 112.
B00LFZSFS8|5|Awesome! The brother-in-law loved it.
B00KSCF366|4|Excellent fit
B003YJE75I|4|just a tad short for me
B00N0PFQQK|5|these socks came in 2 days I am so happy with them if your a OF fan I recommend these socks :)
B001SLHCTM|4|Is a little small, is comfortable but I believe it doesn't fit as it looks in the picture. In the picture it looks like she has wires on her bra.
B00M1GEG6A|4|Runs just a bit small---wish strap was wider and more colors available---but love the material.
B002QREFKG|3|Good
B0054O3VR6|5|having been giving them as gifts to friends and family when I need a little something. Works great love that they fold to take up less space in your purse for storage.
B00H9WUVTM|5|This is flowy and unusual colors.  It will help pull any outfit together.  From Jeans and a tee, to a nice black suit.  and it can be worn all seasons.  Black with flowers is a wonderful mix.
B003LNXARS|2|I ordered an XX Large shirt to account for shrinking and it didn't even fit when it arrived. I also ordered a Large in another color and that one was the same size as this XX Large shirt!  I'm not sure why the gray one fit so much smaller.  :(
B00BZQ7RWC|5|Let me tell you, the ladies swoon when I wear this shirt. Before I left the party, I had many jealous boyfriends and husbands giving me the &#34;stink eye.&#34;
B00B7IPRGG|2|My little one just turned three and is still wearing mainly size 2T in clothes. I ordered the 3T in hopes that it might fit for more than just the summer, but it was far too tight. Plus, it fit so that there was about an inch of room between the end of the shirt and the bottoms rather than an overlap to protect her from the sun. This is going back.
B00FQHNXGK|4|I was very skeptical when this dress arrived. The package was so thin i thought there was no way theres a dress in this bag. But i opened it n agreed with the other reviews that the material is thin but hugs your body very nicely. I was even able to pull it up with a pair of jeans n use it as a long shirt. Since the dress is very plain i also accessorized it with a scarf. Very nice for the money!
B00MCKNAB2|3|I didn't like this. It just seemed too drapey, which made me look hippy, and I just lost over 50 lbs so &#34;hippy&#34; won't work for me if I don't have to. However, the material is lovely, and I suppose if you can sew, and give yourself a bit of intake toward the middle, it would be worth buying. New York Collection has beautiful clothes. I highly recommend THEIR PRODUCTS, just not this particular one for ME.
B0007G971U|2|I was also displeased with the shape and material as compaired with previously bought shirts from russell. they're a totally different shirt from the previous tagged shirts. Where can I buy those?
B002WGEJKM|5|they are a solid set of socks I've gotten a few of these in the past and they are great for me
B007FPPU7Q|3|As always Rubie's items are iffy. My first order showed up in a crappy box, minimal padding inside, and broken in half.  I got my item replaced and the second box was shipped with more stuffing and the cane survived! I noticed a very small chip in the paint on the head, but unless you are specifically looking for it you probably wouldn't even notice. Overall great deal for the price!
B001808WLU|5|works great
B00BF6QVQ0|5|This shirt is very pretty, the brand is excellent and the price is better...I have to pay too much in my country for a shirt of this brand, thanks Amazon.<br /><br />Take in consideration: this shirt run slim.
B00DA1AH7W|5|The shirt was made with a real comfortable material. It looks just like the picture. The print on it looks like it would last a long time. Also , if you are really an evolutionist this shirt is a must have.
B005793JQQ|4|Needed a decent campaign hat for my Boy Scout leader 'field' uniform (campaign hats are great at keeping sun/heat off your head) and found this one here on Amazon. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to things like this so I was expecting to be disappointed because you usually can't get a good hat at a price like this. But I saw the other review an thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />The shape and form of the hat are good, typical styling, nothing odd or out of sorts. The strap was surprisingly good though I may change it out for a leather one someday. The only 'knock' I'd have against it is the felt is a bit thin. Not bad at all, but you can tell that this hat will last 3-7 yrs and not 50 like higher quality felt. This said, a higher quality felt hat will usually run you $100+.
B0008EOB8K|4|They are definitely water resistant and seem sturdy enough which is good because my job requires me to get dirty and bend and lift and all other things that normal dress pants don't like. My only complaint is that I almost always wear a 34x34 in pants but these seem big. I'll get them again in a different color but I'm going to do either 32x34 or 32x32.
B007EKQH74|5|These ear warmers are comfortable and do the job!<br />They will keep my son's ears warm in the Pittsburgh winter.
B008YLCOG0|5|this is a good product, fit as expected
B008OX6UWM|4|No frills costume<br />Delivers all the basics you need<br />Mine tore within minutes of putting on. Don't expect high quality
B00GGCLNR0|5|A good fit, a great product - as always from L'eggs.
B00KJ2Y1OU|5|Bought for a gift.
B00OR8H4XM|5|Perfect fit. Fits nicely under dresses or thin shirts. Skin tight and stretches well. Comfortable.
B00FOSLZBG|2|Only worn these once and one sock already has a hole in it.  The size is very small too.  Don't recommend.
B00U78VXC4|5|Nice and light weight daisy detail is super cute.
B00PT00FT2|5|I'm happy.
B005CSNXB8|3|rather large- bottom of legs very loose.
B00L0S9I7M|5|Super soft - what else can be said !
B00835QPVW|3|it was okay, came as described. Fits okay, a bit bigger than expected but not bad. I use it often.
B00LII69VC|3|fit is fine the dress was worn once and washed according to instructions, the threads unravelled around the arm holes.
B008V9DUPY|4|Perfect fit and great quality. Soft and very well made. It is snug fitting so if you've got something under your shirt you want to hide - this is NOT the right shirt for that.
B00EE4DGJ0|5|My absolute favorite maternity/nursing piece of clothing. So versatile! I've bought a few as gifts for pregnant friends as well!
B00LGDZL04|2|Cheaply made
B000811GDQ|5|Bought this hat as my daily walk around hat. Fits well. Keeps light rain off my head. Reminds me of driving on the road
B00EJZERGA|5|Love all of these dresses.
B009PI8GD6|4|I purchased them with another pair to do my cold weather winter chores in.  I haven't used these gloves yet but they look as if they will do the trick.  The other pair are very similar and are great.
B0066C71KI|5|My mom wanted something like Pajama jeans so I bought her this. My mom loves them. It has a maternity looking top portion to the pants. It is cotton rather than nylon or polyester. I guess because I was buying them for her I didn't notice the description. :-) She said they were comfy. These are her second favorite pants. These are now her favorite pants and she wants them in different colors. She wears them every day. Poor pants. She loves it.
B00AWVFZBQ|4|This belt runs a bit small, so while the 36 fits it is a tad tight with the second hole being used. I am mulling whether or not to punch two half-spaced holes between 2 and 3 for a finer fit. Yeah, losing another 2 kilos would also help, but more holes is more better sometimes. If I paid fill price I'd return it, but it's a closeout and the price is hard to beat for the overall quality.<br /><br />Good leather, nicely paneled canvas and a cool forged buckle. John Varvatos style all the way!
B00XV6KUB4|3|The fit made me feel like a scuba diver. Didn't like the zipper either.
B00EARNX0S|3|The product is fine but because it is a little long on me it rolls under.  That can easily happen with a bralette but it is not a shaper.
B005TG0IKM|5|This is a SUPER sweet shirt. HOWEVER, it really does look like the \\"real thing\\" issued in county jails. I've been stopped on numerous occasions and even had security called on me for wearing it...which made it all the more sweet lol!!
B00INROQHK|4|The dress fits me well.. Really like the belt coming with the dress.  Overall I like the dress, a good summer dress.  Johns new York doesn't disappoint ...
B0035RV734|3|So I buy many of these types and this one seems to fit a bit big.  The pads seem a tad too bulky and do not stay put.  I have to be careful as to what I wear with this particular bra.  I would recommend for a larger bust.
B001KFURA2|3|We bought this for a cousin who likes products made in the USA. It said that it was but it is somewhere else
B004BDOPVM|5|same as always buy
B00D9J7T62|5|Super comfy. Fits perfect. I have a really large chest & things usually fit really tight across my breasts & fit elsewhere or if I buy to fit my chest the shirt is always hanging off of me. This shirt fit beautifully though. Finally something just like the picture!
B00B1KWFK6|5|Delighted with this purchase, it is exactly as it is described.  Very well stitched.  Great customer service from the seller.  It arrived very quickly, much faster than I expected which is brilliant. Packaged carefully.  Overall, very happy with this product.
B0088QLEEY|4|My daughter loves this jacket,it's soft and comfortable.It fits just right.I wish the zipper was little bit bigger,so she could zip it by herself.
B000VDXCJC|1|The ends are not finished so they fray. They are very cheap looking and don't stay up very well. I love leg warmers but these are a joke.
B00NER3L7K|4|Very pretty, but had to return as the large was extremely huge, like I had ordered  a man's shirt.  Other reviews saying shirt ran small are deceptive. I am a female, am 5'6&#34;, and weigh 138 lbs.  A small would be OK.
B0035I40N2|5|i got this for my son who collects russian / soviet militaria. and he loves it. it is of good quality and looks good.
B0002TNBS2|4|Great shirt, good quality as always, very bright!<br />Turn on your Love Light! Nothing left to do but, smile, smile, smile!
B009GBNE7U|2|I bought an x-large and it was sufficating.  Not worth it to return so I will give it away to a small child.
B003MRV750|5|WOW! Loved this costume!! GREAT PRICE AND GREAT QUALITY! Highly recommend!!! This is probably one of the best costumes i've owned that was good, and was inexpensive! Looks just like the picture!
B007H2L58A|5|I loved this gown
B00MTFK9I2|5|I love this sweater it is so comfortable. I could wear it all year
B006B3T87G|5|They go great with her corset, and provide easy access.
B00CJU5TLY|4|Ordered this product and immediately tried it on.  It was a bit snug but id rather have snug than loose and wobbly on my head. The paint job on it appears to be handdone. A bit sloppy but if your ordering online and your a big carnage fan like i am, then you don't care if the paint job is handdone. It gives the mask character. The holes on the side are a tad annoying, but useful if u want to hear anything.  All in all, i recommend it just because of how awesome it looks to a comic geek like me.
B00IROI3OQ|5|good
B00T3Z32RQ|4|My bf likes it but the large is big
B00MQRBPY0|1|too big. it was ugly
B00LOMJ79S|5|Very nice shirt. Very thick material. My son loves it. The colors are very nice. Wish they made it an assortment of colors.
B006HFJA12|5|Absloutly love this backpack, fits everything I need and then some plenty of space for a college or high school student. And for traveling
B00MUT4DC0|5|This dress is as if came straight from the movie! Better than disney. The attention to detail is remarkable. The chest design is embroidered not screen printed. It is a full length dress. It is dress material not the flimsy itchy costume material. Don't be afraid of the shipping time! I ordered on Sept 24 and I received it Oct 6. My daughter is getting this dress along with frozen on ice tickets for her 7th birthday! The dress is a lil big, but my daughter is very petite. I can easily throw in a few stitches to tighten up.
B008MNH9DI|5|got these for a friend for her baby shower a while back, it was the most talked about gift at the shower. Got them again for a recent shower and again, most talked about gift. GREAT WAY for babies to wear cute shoes without spending a ton of money, or having sweaty feet!
B00R595EA0|5|The original purchase was too small, it was a hassle to send it back and exchange it, but when we finally got the right size, it was very nice.
B00SXTLT3M|5|I absolutely love this dress! The fabric is nice and comfortable and it looks really sexy ! The slit is a little high but I probably should've just ordered a size up. All in all I got a lot of compliments and will be wearing this again!
B00T7EXX9U|5|I really like this baseball cap!  I wear baseball caps to work as I do work outside in the heat and I need something to keep my hair out of my face.  This hat has worked great for me.  It is made very well and should last quite a while.  I like the velcro in the back to adjust it to fit my head perfect.  I don't like the snap kind as I adjust my caps once I have them on and that snap can hurt my head.  The padding around the cap is comfortable and the material is somewhat breathable.  This helps for me not to sweat too much from my head while working.<br /><br />I received this product at discount for a truthful and unbiased review. My opinions and all thoughts reflected in this evaluation are solely my own.
B008S998U8|5|Been wearing Dickies brand pants for work over 25 years. The quality remains high. The pants are very durable, hold an excellent crease and always look crisp and neat.
B00801Q5V4|5|Great shirt.
B0087JBVF4|5|Very fast shipping - product was just as described by other reviews - well made for the price and adorable and you do have to do something to make the tail feathers stand up better. Overall, very pleased.
B00M7E92NS|3|Get what u pay for , nice in long but a little smaller than expected .
B004FPYVZQ|3|Good price and confortable. I really good for the hot afternoons. Be aware of the white parts and the wrong underwear.
B007K9UVAI|3|Definitely looser than name brand headbands, nice for around the house, but not for working out or if needed to kept hair back. Cute colors for fall. The colors are true to the picture.
B00NILLBPQ|2|to small in the shoulders and arms.. the rest its fine!.. Not for hot weather!
B003AU5WE6|5|Really pleased! Going to buy a lot more! I love how its a some what tight fit on the neck and wrist! Makes it look so good!
B00A773MMY|1|Very poor quality and not really made for professional use. Look elsewhere for business wear. May be useful for a young child, or teenager.
B0006I3OU4|4|Silky and comfortable....run a bit large
B00LO3FRIW|5|But I really like the length and the feel of the material. I'm 5'6&#34; and I have no time to check the size I ordered, but I think it's &#34;taille unique&#34; ... will get back to this if needed.
B001AVUGNY|5|This was a well constructed product arrived very quickly and we will get some years of enjoyment out of it.  My wife looked very sexy in this outfit.
B0091K8K2K|1|Wouldn't call this a Kilt... The guy in the pic is wearing a kilt. The one I got would allow my first prize ribbon to show... So unless it was made for a Hobbit I would be cautious of the one size fits all novelty kilt... It's total length was 8&#34; from the waist band which should be somewhere around the navel.
B00KZ1BDXW|5|Perfect for my needs.
B000KRTI0Q|4|Good cheap costume for santacon. I added spikes to mine and bought done fake white fur to tuck into the tops of my boots. The pants are lame, just wear your own black pants. The boot top things are okay but I have my own high boots. The hat could be better but overall not bad for the price.
B001A42IMS|5|I love over the calf socks. To me this is the best over the calf sock that ever was made. Durable construction, thick and comfortable, true over the calf height, and has stood up to daily wear and washings. If your looking at Hanes or any other over the calf sock, read the reviews. They stink. They have changed over the years and they are not what they used to be. I bought a package of over the calf socks from Hanes and every single sock was a different length and some of them didnt even reach high enough or stay up while wearing them. This sock from Wigwam is exactly what it says it is and I love them. I will be a buyer for ever as long as they keep the same quality.
B00DYOQFO4|5|This dress is awesome! It is hard to get on over the breasts, but once its on it fits great because the top is loose and stretchy. It also stays up well because the top straps keep the sequined part upright. A few sequins have fallen off, but you can barely tell. I would be careful with sizing because the hip makes it hard to get over your head and shoulders, but the top is very loose so a bigger size might not stay up. Worth the risk, but be careful because shipping took about 2 months.
B00R3Z3P3Y|5|I am loving my hat and scarf and it matches perfectly with my coat
B003JCR4H8|5|Love these earwarmers! I bought them for my husband, but we fight over who gets to use them. I thought at $20 they were a little pricey, but after receiving, they're totally worth it. I received a knock-off pair as a gift, and they're nowhere near as nice. The collapsible feature is a real plus. They fit into the \\"secret pocket\\" of my husbands leather jacket which is really convenient.
B0010KEZZ0|1|We were required by Amazon to fill in at least one star.  We would have preferred to fill in NO STARS AT ALL.    These hats did not fit any of our students, large or medium or small students (we used only one hat to estimate).  The indent for the head was perfectly round and real heads are not.  The circumference was misrepresented.  They had only 22 hats so we ordered them all because we needed 35.   We paid shipping, of course,to get the hats, and then, to return the items we were required to pay the shipping AGAIN - AS WELL AS a re-stocking fee.  We will NOT order from this company ever again and will restrict Amazon shopping to things we can better judge as adequate.      A more local costume shop named Buffalo Breath had exactly what we needed (the hats had oval-shaped head holes!), had all 35, and while they were required to charge sales tax, there was no shipping charge.
B00GB0G41C|5|As much as you can love underwear :)  These are nice.
B008D4TZVK|5|I am plus size and short and this still fit perfectly. It also fits my skinny tall boyfriend, so when they say one size fits all they are pretty darn correct. This was a great costume and is so cozy that I have worn it to bed on a couple very cold nights. I also plan on using it for Chickafila's cow day. :)
B003NX8CPQ|5|Excellent jacket! Fit as expected. Great value.
B00BYQUBYE|5|This shirt is really unique and pretty. Patty never disappoints when it comes to their products and the fabrics they use are pretty nice as well. I own many shirts from Patty and ive been pretty lucky with what ive purchased from them.
B00CYAY032|5|The low cut ones did show through in several of my shoes, but these didn't.  I will buy more.  The small/medium fit my size 7 feet.
B007SNX7B6|2|They fit perfect but the little slits in the knee part split more and were ripping more  so she has to wear stockings underneath, if it rips she won't be able to wear them. She really liked them but it afraid that when I wash them the holes will be to big to wear
B0051U182S|5|Super duper warm wearing just the sock alone its a little high but that could be because my feet are small, great pair though.
B0094E5YN6|4|nicely made.  I wear a 36B bra and this fits comfortably and is pretty front and back.  I purchased one in red at a much higher price elsewhere so find these in white priced well. There is a very light stay down each side which keeps the garment from bunching up. a problem I had with other bralettes. Smoothes out your back.  I am a bit above average in the ribcage but this is not too tight.
B00K0KFBBI|5|We'll made for a great price
B008G0TPYS|4|love this shirt, but ordered a Xl due to reading other review stating this was running a little large. Wish I would have ordered a Large. But, still very pleased with the quality of this shirt.
B00IU1UKYM|4|Fits great!
B00CSF10SQ|5|I usually wear a medium, however, it was sold out so I took a chance on large.  It fit perfectly!  Maybe you should order one size larger depending on how snug you want the fit.  Ralph Lauren lived up to its high quality standards.  I have received many compliments!  Everyone order one!
B00UG293KU|2|Need a bigger size
B00G3DBKMU|5|I bought this for my sister and she loves it.  I would call the color more of a coral than red, which in my opinion makes it better.  Perfect length for an infinity scarf.
B002SIFHBY|2|I am a size 2/4 and socks are tight and uncomfortable. Expensive for a novelty item that does not function well as actual socks. Probably other skeleton socks that are of higher quality and fit better.
B00K78BBJE|3|Levi's quality has diminished in the last 5-8 years.
B00LHJH5G0|4|Good price, cute fit on an almost 2 year old
B001CL8JOK|5|I purchased this coat after reading the reviews and knowing it was hounds tooth.  Yahoo removed their picture of the black coat and kept the customer's picture which showed the correct fabric and details.  The coat arrived and it is as lovely as the picture.  I have noticed that the belt at the waist is a little higher than the waist for me which I may decide to adjust. Other than that, the coat is comfortable.  I purchased the largest available at that time which was an XL, and being a 1X, it fits fine.  I am very pleased with this purchase
B00N2UROPY|1|These shorts have no liner and are pointless unless you were shorts or boxers underneith. Didn't dare get them wet because they would be completely see thru.
B003AYVGQ0|1|Broke the second day, the pieces slid very poorly. Overall, horrible purchase. The inside of it has some kind of foil that comes undone and obscures the view.
B002ZE5ZUY|4|its nice and its not really a winter beanie it more like its kinda chilly type of a beanie .
B009KFGWH6|5|I love this hat. it exceeded my expectations and it fit perfect. Great look and it goes with just about anything you wear. Makes a great addition to your hat collection.
B004DUG0R0|5|Great shemagh. It is a bit cheap, meaning the weave is loose and the fabric is thin. However, I use this one for running in the heat. So it works perfectly. Keep sand and dirt out of your eyes, hair, and neck without adding much sweat.
B005G4VIRE|5|Receiver has told me how much he really loves this wrap. He uses it at the health club each day.
B007XF8QPG|1|broke taking out of package
B010EH1LEM|5|Perfect  cute comfy
B00BBRL64A|5|The jeans are lightweight and comfy for my daughter to wear and the top has really nice dark blue detailing which has held up very well in the wash.  Overall, very cute!
B00NALN81Y|4|Gave as a gift. As I stated with my other reviews just a bit shorter than I wanted, but I can't complain.  Price is too good if you're looking for a lightweight scarf!
B0047N0CPY|5|These are nice, soft cotton, the quality is very good, and the sizing is exactly right (fit great now and still room to grow).  They are medium-weight for spring and fall (in New York).
B00GBW1J1K|5|it is a bit loose on my shoulder but it is very pretty and the quality is good, it is made of thick material so it works well for cold weather, shipping was quick.
B00NYJU982|4|It is a beautiful dress and looks great on.  For the price, it is a good buy
B00CYBCK2E|5|Love it. Fabric feels so nice and its so cute. I wore it to the beach and everyone thoughts was cute
B00GKCAJN0|1|This is too loose for serious swimming or water sports--any wave or other aggressive action will cause it to wash right up your mid-section.
B0006I9Y2G|5|Every woman knows the annoyance of rushing to the airport or out of the gym in the morning trying to delicately place your hot curling iron in your bag.  This bag is the best!  You can literally throw and go.  My mom has used mine and loves it, too.  I'm getting her one of her own.
B00I2TKIVM|5|great product, she loved it, and it fit as expected.
B00CHMKA8G|1|I got different leggings than the ones shown, they're very see through, and very uncomfortable  to wear.
B004CYWU6M|5|I bought this for a gift for a gift and it is beautiful! Just like the picture and great quality!
B0049NGS4G|5|great product great service
B00CG6FSBM|3|A nice dress but fits a little small. You may want to pick one size larger. I love the style.
B00STV31LM|5|This is a great shirt! I'm wearing it all Pi day!
B003CNVFOC|5|Fits perfectly and it looks amazing! The only thing is youll need a slip beneath it. Otherwise, I love it!
B00ABDLLVI|5|I like the way this shirt looks on my less than perfect body.  It has a nice drape to it and a good length that allows me to wear it without tugging at it.
B0031TVVIW|5|These are great for comfort. The cotton is thin and soft and they fit a fuller body very nicely. I love that they take care of the panty line issue without having to have a thong up my rear end.
B004H13JRY|5|I was a size 14 before my pregnancy, and I'm now in my seventh month. These pants fit wonderfully, and they're lightweight, so they're perfect for wearing to the office in the Texas summer heat. They've also held up well after several washings. Totally worth the price; love them.
B00AOCV8Z0|3|Smaller than expected. The sleeves were too short but the length was fine.
B0050JQSPC|4|I love this bra and now have five of them.  So much more comfortable than the Playtex front hook bra and far more attractive.  The back of the Bali Brasette is so comfortable and the straps stay up, even though they looked a bit flimsy at first.  My two criticisms: (1) the cups encourage the \\"up and out\\" look of a Wonderbra, which isn't exactly what I need in a DD cup; and (2) the hooks are very small and take some practice.  However, some judicious stuffing and rearranging has mostly resolved the first issue.  Since I have arthritis in my shoulders, front hook bras are necessary on bad days, and it's nice not to have to wear an \\"orthopedic\\" looking bra.  All in all, this is the best bra I've found for my situation.  And the Amazon price is the best I've found.<br /><br />Update:  Of course, Bali no longer makes this bra.  This happens to me so often...
B001CVCW4I|1|The costume was very small. I usually wear a 2x but bought bigger due to reviews. Couldn't even get it zipped. It was very cute though.
B008CGQQXY|3|arms are fine.  I'm a thin person and this has too small a waist for me.  its also rather short
B00XMK9L00|5|I think this wallet is extremely well made.  I was amazed at the quality, and how Wide the Wallet actually opens up for cash.  I thought the divider in the cash part was ingenious, and I like the Folding Flap for the ID.  The wallet does all this, but I also noticed how thin the wallet closes for being a Leather Wallet.  I can't stand when Wallets are huge, and people can tell whats in my Back Pockets.  It really is a nice wallet.  I received product at discount for my opinion.
B00DHX4IQ4|5|It's a very nice t-shirt.  Fit is true to size, and it's funny.  Everybody laughs - and the dogs like it, too.
B0028SUDMM|5|I love them! I've owned a pair before and knew how they fit - now I have 3 pair. It's true that the waist is a bit fitted as other customers noted but I like it that way - even though I need size 14, it goes with my shape. And they are very slimming! I always get compliments when I wear them.
B007M82OZ2|4|I never have issues with Patty sizing but this item did happen to be a bit small. I'll have to wear it with camisoles.
B004IXY8LC|5|My husband loves these shorts and they wash up so nice, they are extremely soft material, he wants more of them
B00GW3XR72|5|It was a gift. They were very happy with it.
B00MCABI2A|3|Very pretty, cut a little weird, got here quicker than expected, I am a size 16 I got a XL and its a bit too big I will have to get it taken in a little, color not as vibrant as expected the black lines are gray, still nice though
B00BTMYUL8|5|Wonderful product.  Will buy from this company again.
B0045H0L1W|3|Out of 40, 27 were good,  6 were shaky with loose connections and switches,  6 were bad (including the 3 that were on and dying in the box when it arrived).  The ones that were good were very bright.  Some switches were much easier to operate than others.
B00C245SS6|5|For whatever reason I was expecting sleeveless, but after trying it on I was not disappointed.  Awesome fit
B00HWUL75I|4|Light weight cotton top is great for non-stick sweating. I wear mine to play tennis. Weight is light, but fabric is not sheer. Very flattering neckline and cap sleeve, ruching in the back adds interest and hides those bulges around the bra band. Colors and shape hold up after multiple washings. Another great Columbia value.
B003G2Z720|4|these fit great and look very stylish however extra care is needed as the color can fade quickly and they are not that durable (fray easily, I owned multiple pairs)
B000JHFEQO|5|All items came quickly and in superb condition. I'm very pleased with the transaction.
B003IYYE8E|5|I LOVE MY UNDERCOVER MAMA TANKS! I was really nervous about nursing my baby in public so I wanted to find a few tanks to help with the awkward-ness of the whole ordeal. I am a pretty large breasted gal normally but you add in that I am nursing and my breasts are just HUGE! This made  finding a nursing tank top that fits in the breast and body area VERY difficult if not impossible. I have spent so much money on several different brands that just didn't cut it. They were either not good in the breast or they weren't long enough or they didn't fit in the body part or a combination of all.  BUT.. Your shirts are perfect. I can wear my fitted bra and they fit just fine. No more uni-boob for this girl!  Im so glad I found these.   I plan on this being one of my \\"standard\\" shower gifts!
B00CF6NKNG|5|My blouse size is a 36.  The large is a good fit and the x-large is a loose fit, and they both look great.  The fabric is comfortable.  I do hand wash them just to preserve the quality.  I would get one in every color.
B00KCB2RP8|4|Everything fits great except for the shoes, a little on the bulky side
B0122WHYNO|5|Interesting !!!
B00J919ZXO|5|This top is stylish and sophisticated; the color is crisp and the material is soft. The design is just stunning - I get compliments and see heads turning when I wear it out. Like all PattyBoutik clothes, there is just enough length and stretch to fit a tall woman perfectly. I ordered two other halter styled tops and again, heads turn. These halters are beautiful and comfortable.
B001GT347U|5|Works really well on pants that are not quite the right size
B004K7TA7S|4|I am a Lions Club member and several members of our club bought this shirt to wear at casual events.  It's a big hit everywhere.  My only problem with it is that it is very long and if I want to tuck it in, half of the lion's face disappears, so I have to wear it out.  Overall I'm pleased with the purchase.
B002GNW4SA|5|Husbands favorite coat. He was very happy.
B004A9L54C|5|I purchased this for our best friends who recently had a baby boy.  They loved it and thought the message was hilarious since the baby was conceived in Hawaii! So cute and perfect!
B00FIT2M4K|3|the stitching around the neck and sleeves suck.
B0006SFF42|5|This wrangler cowboy cut shirt is a quality garment. The shirt is warm enough, but breathes, so is not sweaty. The double pockets are perfect, and the cut is roomy. The snap front is easier than buttons, and looks better, too. Recommended for guys and gals! For a heavier weight shirt, try: [[ASIN:B0007SMLB6 Wrangler Men's Cowboy Cut Work Western Long Sleeve Shirt]].
B00GIWL0X0|5|Great high quality shirt, with a great design for those of us who believe in our 2nd Amendment Rights. I would have preferred a screen printed design, rather than an iron-on, but either way it is a great shirt.
B00DQH0V0S|5|Great cool socks!
B00K69YIM6|3|Cute pajamas. My daughter likes the matching doll jammies. The top runs a little small, which I find is often a problem with children's pajamas. Overall satisfied,
B0058BA1B4|5|This top is very nice looking. I got it in size 6x for my 5.5 y girl and it fits nice, a bit loose, but enough room for the coming fall/winter. The material is very soft and sturdy, I loved it very much and my girl loved it too.
B007U4P298|2|The fit of the pants is very strange.  Ill-fitting for sure, but there is something else that is wrong but I can't figure it out.  Just, perhaps, poorly made?  Again, I am not sure.Certainly not like the usual track pants that I have purchased in the past.  Price is good if you don't mind looking funny.
B0040MM2VE|4|good
B00CAI944S|5|good
B00BYWB6OM|4|I bought a L size /32 but a little bit small for my waist. the color different a lot with that i expected, but use to it for my daily .
B006TC6MDM|1|Returned
B00005KJXN|3|This product is not as advertised. It is not an authentic Habit and it includes gag headbands, like 4 versions. The material is very thin, not good for a Halloween night in Seattle, Washington. I was hoping for an authentic Mother Superior Habit...a good sign was the price. LOL!!
B004Q62ADO|5|I love these thermals. They fit, they're comfortable, they're warm...what else would you want? I've owned every brand out there and Duofold tops all of them.
B003T9TUUU|4|I am a photographer and purchased this costume to use for the babies that come to the studio for their holiday sessions. The costume is no doubt super cute but the hood seems to be a little tight for the babies that should fit this size. It either falls off or doesn't fit at all.<br /><br />Other than that I would say it's a nice costume, not perfect though.
B002QCC0B2|5|I wear these all the time. They are comforting and warm, a little emo, and you can do things in them.
B003XBZKQ2|2|this bra is not like the one i had before from vanity fair...the fabric is thinner and not a high quality..fit runs small. I ordered a product number from an old one and they sent a different product number...close to the old one but not the same. I was disappointed but not enough to send it back.
B00843CH2Y|1|I read some of the reviews before ordering and almost everybody said they ran small in women's sizes so I ordered it in a large. A few days later when I received it, I got my shirt in a large... But for men. I specifically checked &#34;Large in WOMENS&#34; sizes and received the men's shirt with no return reciept. Wth
B00DQYHLJK|1|Bad quality & the size not as expected at all !
B0000ZDDMM|5|This is a wonderful bra for the well-endowed. Have been using this model of Chantelle's forever. As it's seamless, i would highly recommend to any woman who wants to wear close-fitting tops. Actually, i wear it every day no matter what's underneath. Some bras for my size feel like trusses--this is anything but.
B004764EDC|4|This scarf is good quality for the price, comfortable and stylish.  I would recommend it is very versatile.  The material has a light weight to it making it great for summer months along with the cooler months.  Can't go wrong with black and white goes with anything.
B0012OAP7Q|2|Runs short in the arms.  Fit okay elsewhere.
B003JD5GOA|4|Very large but very cute.
B003XG1TAS|5|Gift for my dad big boy. Soft, thick, fab ulous quality!
B00008KBLJ|4|there soft and fuzzy on the inside and cool and sleek on the outside i can't wait to get my own!!:) if you don't have a pair i suguest you get some you won't regret it!!
B00LAD5WMW|5|We love these!  There is a flap under the zipper for safety-no pinching that is great. They are very soft.
B006NU5X9O|4|I like the dress, but I bought it because I thought it was red. The pic looks red, but the dress is orange. Still very cute and comfy :)
B000QIWBX0|5|fit great
B00780Y5HO|3|I love the color and  LOVE the fabric. If only it would have covered my entire butt, I'd have been much happier. I expected these to be full coverage because they are &#34;boy shorts&#34;. I wear a size 10/12 in pants and ordered a size 6 undies, based on the sizing chart listed. The bottoms of my cheeks hung out, giving me a perma-wedgie on my wedding day. Good thing I was too excited to notice most of the day. I am sad that I'll never wear these again because I don't enjoy digging my panties out of my bum all day.
B000VYVRGQ|3|The shirt is cute and really nice quality. Unfortunately it would fit our cat better than the kid --- OK I am exaggerating a bit but really this shirt is way too small for size zero daughter. Sigh
B0038JQVPI|5|If you are obsessive about socks that are tight and stay up, these are not for you. But many have blood circulation problems from socks with too much elastic and grip your calves like a vise. Yes, they might sag from a lack of binding elastic, but no more cramped calves.
B004M43UWK|4|I am a serious wolf and animal shirt enthusiast. I own at least 100 shirts from The Mountain. While I very much enjoy this shirt and the powers that I take from it, the panda is almost too realistic. It's as if the panda is staring into your soul. My soul does not want to be looked into
B00417G91M|5|This was my daughter's first Halloween costume. It was warm and super cute. Material a little itchy though.
B00BT0K6MW|5|This shirt is lightweight and fits perfect! It is soft and my husband is happy! Didn't shrink when washed either!!!
B0045PNGGG|5|Great looking thong. It is a great head turner on the beach. Even had a few guys stop me on the beach and ask me where I got it!
B0073YHIMO|4|These were a purchase for my son, who really likes them a lot. The magnifying lenses were lost almost immediately, as they are not permanently fixed to the goggles -- my only gripe. They're fun and look good.
B006Z5U43M|5|very nice thank you.
B009VNARYQ|3|I've seen cheaper handkerchiefs.  But these are not much better.  I was hoping for something more substantial.  That once washed it'd still feel heavy and nice.  They don't.  I starch them and fold them and carry them, against a chance for needing one now and then.  Some day I'll find nice linen hankerchiefs, and while I know They'll cost $10-15 apiece, I'll buy them.  Just because...
B00972E78S|4|I bought this because the color really attracted me.<br /><br />This is a wrap around skirt, so I recommend wearing tights or some form of covering under it in the event that the wind blows (otherwise, you may have an unfortunate moment out in public). However, I am a larger person (US size 14) and am 5'9&#34; and I had no problems with this skirt fitting my body type. As a matter of fact, I really like how you can adjust where this sits and that it doesn't have elastic in it  (because it is a wrap around skirt).<br /><br />I haven't noticed any bleeding of the colors either the few times I have washed it, which is saying something.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the loops that you use to hold down the ties were not really sewn in the best way, so the extra fabric from the loop is just hanging out and kind of looks unsightly. I would recommend you hand sew them in place against the band of the fabric if it bothers you.
B00MHDY70M|1|UMmm. THis was the worst buy ever. I ordered an XL but the shirt was a small......i have emailed the seller for a real XL or my money back. if your 4'5 and 100 lbs this shirt will work but im a normal 5'9 140 and its to small
B008294GD8|4|I loved my costumed. It was tighter than I expected and the neck part was too tight and uncomfortable to zip all the way but that was no big deal for me. Im about 5'2 or 5'3 and at the time weighed probably 103 pounds. I ordered a small and found the fit just a little off. It rides up a lot in the girl parts and tears very easily. I however feel that a medium would of maybe been too big. Overall, I was pleased with the way it looked but found it cheaply made and just a little bit too small.
B00KHRMJM8|4|A little closer that I would like but a nice look!
B009FV9I08|5|Very fashionable and comfortable.  Purchase several in colors I needed.
B00MBGZ39Y|4|It fit ok. It wasn't really what I expected it really restricts movement.
B004CO39EO|2|I bought this in a man's large. It is so small, my petite (110 lb) wife can barely get it on.  The sizing sure isn't for men as advertised.  Opened and in good faith discarded the packaging. My neighbor's got a 5 year old, I'll give it to him  if it isn't too small.
B00366LQHG|5|I ordered the small black one, and found it of very high quality, soft fur down the front, and the fit very comfortable, as well as the weight of it. I absolutely love this vest, its soothing and cozy. I got lots of compliments, ewws and ahhs at work, everyone wanting to touch and get one for themselves. Very very nice vest.
B003JBGTM0|5|It is one of the most comfortable bra for me. The material is so soft. It deserve the price. And you can change it after breast feeding into normal one. It has special design for nursing. It has a band instead of a piece of cloth which is more convenient.
B0090CKNV0|4|I read other reviews and went a size up and was glad I did. The bra covers, stays on really really well even after cleaning but I found it offered very little support and even after several adjustments the strap did not really do anything for me. In essence it is natural in the most natural sense of the word so if you sagged before you probably still will. I am gonna need some duct tape for the formal affair that I bought it for to supplement my braless look.
B00W41LXQI|3|Runs small around ribs but cups fit my boobs
B0058BWBJY|4|I'm 5'1\\" and the length is perfect to wear at work. It looks great with belt, but don't even try to wear it without belt, its style is really strange and has no waist at all. But in other respects this dress is gorgeous.
B00G9HDME4|5|My granddaughter loved it!
B006ODTHGU|4|Love the design but print looks a little stretched.
B00IF7FN9I|3|I found the medium a little large in the shoulders and stiff in the collar area. Nice studding. Didn't care a lot for the twisted fringe.
B000WPWXPI|4|it was good over all
B00GLNTA38|1|Had a strong ink smell. Also there was black spot.
B00GPG5MLA|5|Good choice
B00IGF5H3Q|5|I own several of these shirts so obviously I really like them. They drape beautifully and have a classy yet casual look to them. This is a slightly thicker tencel so maintains it shape very well. Doesn't wrinkle easily.
B002Y34QI8|5|beautiful! i love it i brought it for the formal dinner on a cruise im going on and it looks so good on me but also elegant
B00G9IXSRE|4|Well I love these tights however, I thought I was gonna get one of each color like the pic. Didn't get any pink, got 2 pair of white ones and a dark blue pair that I wasn't expecting. ...but great tights nice and soft.
B000VK0WF2|5|Great fit holds me up the way I like.
B0091DWSIY|4|Very comfortable, looks cool.  I wear a large, and this was just a bit tight.  Not uncomfortably so, but just so you know it's on the smaller range.
B003H145LY|3|I expected the &#34;assorted&#34; to mean the assorted colors as pictured and expected to get at least one pair of black. Instead I got an assorted pack with none of the colors shown. They were in colors that I would not have selected...who wants horizontal stripes!
B007B5DLVC|5|A gift for a college-girl grand daughter.  She loves them.  She lives in Minnesota so needs the warmth, but of course wants to look jazzy too,  These work
B00NFXZS1U|5|The price was low, quality is good, and it works great.
B00CO96K1I|3|I was excited because these are inexpensive and cotton and involve a skirt, which is my preference. They're okay. The skirt doesn't really adequately cover my rear end as it does in the picture, but it's not bad. They're very comfortable, but also very thin. If I can do a warrior 1 and see my knee through the fabric, I will likely be over-sharing with the neighbor on the mat behind me anytime there's a forward bending position on the books. Since I wear stuff like this around the house and so forth, and I often layer with tights in the winter, I'll keep them.
B00A76I8BU|5|Me and my Husband love this show. I was thrilled to find this shirt for him because Phil is his favorite Captain. I just wish I had ordered me one. RIP Phil.
B005IZTT72|2|I bought it to use on yoga classes....<br />The color isn't what it looks like on the site. Its a baby rose that I didn't like at all!!!<br />The fabric is no good....
B00N4XI5B6|3|I ordered color white and pink but I received the denim bikini.  I want white bikini and pink bra.
B00NMQC7O6|1|Both gloves tore at the thumb after the first ride
B00JV4L4E2|4|Ran smaller than a typical XL. Very urban tight. Inspires me to do more crunches and less lunches.
B00CFU6ZV6|5|Color is perfect, length is good, does not go to my ankles which I like since I am short.  They are comfortable and I wear them around the house and will use for around the campsite when we travel in our trailer.
B004USKJTK|4|This looked very good for the King in AIDA
B007CFJWE6|5|Thinner than athletic socks but thicker than dress socks.  Well made.  Toe seam falls on nails, not straight across the ends of the toes (which would have driven me crazy).  Good buy.  Always have loved Gold Toe and they did not disappoint.
B00IRXIV4E|4|A little bit tight but overall I really like it. Never have I seen a style like that before. Its unique in its truest since. Wish I could have ordered 1/2  size more. Thank you.
B00GCFLCMW|3|It's a good material, fits as expected. But 3 stars since the graphic on the shirt is more a dirty orange than red.
B000UZYX7Q|5|This fit perfectly and was extremely comfortable.
B00LNG1BP8|5|So cozy to wear. As a massage therapist I can move easily and can put my pens, lotion bottle, and gratuities in all my pockets. I ordered the petite small and fit for my 5,1 height perfectly . These are better than the scrubs from Walmart and better material. Will order again.. Easy to wash and worth the value and price for it
B009LR0DKU|5|Amazing quality, color, style. Received many compliments. Shipping was too fast, arrived in couple of days. Liked the quick responses from FLATSEVEN. Highly recommend to all !!! Thanks FLATSEVEN
B001AE9IIA|4|Great Fit
B00J5UKA92|5|Nice top.  Fabric feels good on skin.  Fit is true to size.  Speedy delivery.
B00YUIFNFA|1|I like how they use a small model to put both legs in one leg..instead of finding a plus size model. Also the description could be taken as offensive. Try again please.
B008EYGQW0|3|SOOOO ugly, perfect for the ugly Christmas sweater party, but was really big.  My husband almost always wears a Large and the large I got in this sweater was much too big.
B00C0FUVAM|3|The corset itself is pretty but when it comes to sizing you have to get that down pack a large isn't a large its more like a medium but I will say it arrived on time for my best friends birthday party so we are happy about that I wish I had ordered mine from you guys I would probably have it now !
B00GIBR7NS|5|love it.
B000V0EQ2M|4|The top fit just fine, but the pants were cut too short in the crouch
B00L45G77A|5|Comfortable and perfect fit.
B000SP6UVK|5|The socks fit well which is important for me as I wear an extended size<br />.  They are also comfortable.
B00MUDXIAE|4|Thin dress but sexy
B00KALEXYS|1|I have Tourette Syndrome and I find this shirt very offensive! Would you make fun of someone that has cancer???  How about muscular dystrophy or Downs Syndrome??? This is a very tasteless item I can't believe anyone would buy it.
B00LFWNAQ8|2|Waaaaaay to short. I'm 5'11&#34; and there is no way I can wear this in public. However the material is super soft.
B00MRVCNRI|1|Wow these are little over priced,  the same product is being sold on ebay by silkundershop,  and sistersilk for almost 1/3 less then here for the same exact product.
B002ALIVX0|5|very good
B00LGIAERE|5|I ordered a 30DDD and it fits perfectly even though I'm supposed to be a 28E. The material is soft and the overall quality seems to be really good. I would highly recommend this product.
B000FHC4HA|4|good value for price, looks good, runs a bit large
B00GIDX0CI|3|she likes it , little small for the size . but itll work for the summer.she likes the top alot
B00FOGIJFI|5|I bought a slightly larger fit for my 5-year old boy and he's the envy of everyone in his class. Good quality product and made for the brand to a high standard (made in China).
B0012OAHK6|5|Very comfortable shirt and fits just the way I like.  Wish I could find more shirts that fit as good.
B00EB14104|2|They would be so cute if they had fit right. :/
B00KQ2MYGA|5|My grandson loved it.
B000XMDVWY|1|I measured myself according to the siZe chart and the slip swallowed me whole... Way too big.
B00AJY0U5C|5|Ed hardy is the s*** \^.^/
B00GBGSB44|2|I realizes I ordered a junior size not womens.
B00O89NGC8|5|great shirt for my Packer's fan friend, she will love it
B00FARBCFK|5|I read the reviews and opted to get a larger size. I'm a 34B chest and 28 waist, and the large fits perfectly. Not too tight and not too big. Very long, which is what I love since I don't want to bend over and have skin show. The material is not too thin, but it's not heavy either. Love it!
B003SO83AE|5|I like
B00IUR3TZS|3|The quality is not the best... It is ok for its price. But I would not purchase again.
B007JYBHAM|5|Fits well and long enough.
B00MFAJEAU|5|Very nice outfit.
B00474G5FE|5|I've been buying this onesies since my baby is 3 month old.  I kept buying bigger sizes as my baby grew bigger because I think this onesie is the best.   My baby seems to be very comfortable with this product, durable, soft, 100% cotton, and easy to match with other clothes.
B005JD3U5A|3|They are not as thick or cushioned as the gold toes I've had in the past. They are shorter, thinner, and not as comfy.
B005JU13OS|5|My wife loves it,She can wear it and be sexy and daring. She also wears it with a shirt under and it is a summer dress
B00GD4AMSM|1|This hat  material is very thin.  Disappointed in product.
B00CX0LHN4|1|The jeans were WAY TOO short on my tall 14 year old son who normally wears Levis in a size 18 regular. These fit terribly, however I don't want the hassle of returning them, so I will donate this pair to the church. BAD purchase for me.
B001FFSF92|5|buen producto originales saludos, recomiendo a este vendedor y el tiempo de entrga fue el esperado Good  Good  Good  Good
B00HFQIJBY|5|I love this blouse soooo much that I want it in white.  The fit is perfect and I can't wait to wear it for my 24 Wedding Anniversary this weekend. The delivery time was great!!!!
B00OKXKHNI|5|I got these for my 3-year-old's birthday and she went bonkers. So did her sister, who was sobbing in jealousy, so you may want to go ahead and grab two. They're very soft and fit my daughter well. She wears them all the time. I like that they're not hard on the bottom, which I think is easier for little feet running around.
B00QTA9920|5|Bought this for the wifey to spice things up and she loved it. She is 5'3 114lbs and it fit perfectly on her. If your looking for something affordable and sexy, this might be the lingerie to look for.
B0083G9KZ4|4|I needed a durable lightweight jacket for Mexico. Turns out that it works well for the chilly evening but a bit more bulky than it appears on the model in the picture. Pretty satisfied.
B000PYF8PS|3|I really like this cloak as a scarf. It's a bit short and a lot thinner then I was excepting. I bought a cloak clasp to go with it but the fabric is so light it couldn't hold it properly.
B000HKIC8U|5|well, not really. But this is a good product, it fit my head just fine and i'm a 7 3/8 hat size. its light weight and has a great american pattern on it. It does an ok job holding moisture, but its not very thick so it has its limitations
B0077QBVNK|5|Comfortable inside clothing and provides adequate coverage inside a nice summer sundress, while keeping you cool!<br />The length is also just right.
B00MON2TRI|4|I'm overly picky when it comes to clothes, these are very stretchy and conform well to different body sizes, lack of a fly adds to the comfort . I didn't like how short the legs are on them, they are really more of a &#34;square leg&#34; than a boxer brief in my opinion. My boyfriend on the other hand is far less picky and likes the lack of a fly too, his thighs are small for a guy and these don't ride up on him as many underwear tend to do. The concept of nylon in underwear seems novel but is really awesome, I like the fabric.
B00RV6KPRE|1|EXTREMELY small. I bought a medium, and I normally wear a small/medium in all of my clothes. It was so tiny it was unwearable, my entire bottom was uncovered and the top did not fit either. On top of that, the material is extremely cheap. There was no stretch like you normally see in swimwear, and it felt rough. I returned it and am waiting for the refund. Quick shipping with amazon prime as always!
B00AB0AX4C|4|I tend to agree with some of the reviews that say the Swiss button is too big. I dont actually feel it when its in my pocket so most of the time it doesn't bother me.
B009CCRL6I|5|Absolutely excellent price for quality wool socks,multiple use,mainly for any outdoor activity.Very,very hard to beat pricing!!!Will be buying again!!!Thanks you!!!
B00VX6URGW|5|Fit as expected
B000TBU5OG|5|Been looking for men's turtleneck shirts in local stores without much luck. Then of course I searched the web and found this. Absolutely happy with the shirts. Comfy, Wash and dry well. Husband loves them.
B00HMI3SYS|5|Excellent fit for very tall guys. My husband is 6'4&#34; tall 205 Lbs. We ordered 2XLT and fits well. The Sweatshirt has the perfect length.
B007TYCQO8|3|The dress looks ok, price was good, but it's just not not my style at all. love the color very much.
B00IWO4DZE|5|My favorite little black cardigan. It's perfect!
B001DLO31W|5|needed a 60's costume and this fit the bill perfectly. even got the boots...cute cute cute
B00LURFGH4|1|Material is quite flimsy and for a one size fits most, they don't really hit the mark in that category.  Unless you have stick legs....
B00NU4YGB2|5|Great socks!!!!!!
B00GOL1NYG|4|Fits as pictured! I'm usually a small or medium size in tops. The sleeve length is perfect and length is just below my butt. It was a little more yellowish than pictured, but overall exactly what I wanted! I'm only disappointed that since my order was placed the price dropped like $2 :(<br />Great top though!
B000JTFFNO|5|Jacket came in and had a black spot on the hood but it looks like grease and I got it out. Amazon stated that the jacket would ship the latest of Jan 18th yet the jacket arrived that day. I did not receive a tracking number till after the jacket arrived. I kept checking the status of my order and it stated that the order was shipping soon.    Other than the terrible tracking and information updates, the transaction went well. Product is as described.
B00FXPTEHM|2|Product is much too large, to the point I probably won't even wear it.. Just beware before you purchase, these run large.<br />I got a medium and i'd say it probably fits an XL person around the abdomen area.
B00VOMVCAA|1|The skirt runs way too small. I even tried wearing it higher on my natural waist and it was still too small. I'm a size 4, with a very tiny waist around 27&#34; and can't wear it. It's uncomfortable and was disappointed in it, and won't be able to wear it at all.
B00ESG47HY|5|Study fabric, and good fit.  A school hall must!
B00DT0BWSW|5|Love it but it would have be nice in petite due to the length
B004QF0TFQ|5|I always get this brand and type for my husband, they fit and last and stay up what more can you ask?
B00IE0ZIAA|2|Not what I expected. Too small and I don't like the material. Its not like a sweater material, its tight and feels like spandex. Yuck. Will be returning.
B000FGJL0O|4|The only drawback is that the band isn't adjustable at all - which is a downside when you've got a huge head like me.  :)
B0018OQDHQ|5|Beautiful, delicate necklace - the pink is wonderful.  The necklace is attractive and a nice gift for survivors.
B002X7A3SC|5|This dress fits beautifully. Very flattering for curvy body type. Perfect for work but still sexy. First dress bought on amazon and glad I did.
B00EVM01M0|5|bought haggar pants for several years.  Could not find in stores in bluejeans.  Live in Fl and wear shorts all year with exception of<br />a couple of months.
B00Q42OX8S|1|I can't use that outfit at lol an it's not as shown.
B005CSNUNY|5|5
B00CTA10SK|5|The suit is great fits well true to size I'm wearing this to a beach wedding color is perfect Thank you
B004G8PMT6|3|These pants are comfortable and the material seems to be of quality. However, the size is smaller (more like a mens Medium) than a typical mens XL. I normally wear a womens XL so I ordered a mens XL thinking it would be a little bigger/roomier. Also, I will need to alter the length since they are 6-inches too long (I am 5'6&#34;).
B00OR4UEEC|4|This is not a luxury fabric, more like a school uniform type of material. It is well stitched and has the nice fitted waist and wide skirt effect that I wanted. It also covers my knees standing, so it's not too short sitting.
B000AREBTE|5|Great socks.  Worth the extra money
B00MF9NO6Q|5|I got these as a gift. You can't see it from the pictures but these gloves have a lovely Sherpa/shearling lining the same color as the band of the mitten. The only way I can describe these is that it feels when you're wearing them like someone knitted an over sized mitten and stuffed a bunch of soft lining into the already normal mitten (double mitten) It is plush and cozy and perfect for the below zero wind chills we've been having. I have a problem with my fingers staying warm in the winter but these mittens make my fingers toasty and warm. You'll feel like a lobster in these mittens if you try to do any task more complex than opening a door or driving your car. Overall I would say buy these mittens.
B007P1VG3W|5|Really comfortable and good for those cool fall nights.<br /><br />The colors are nice and vibrant.<br /><br />A nifty feature is the strong elastic at the wrists and ankle giving you that snug fit.
B00F4SKKR6|3|This shirt is small and the material is one that doesn't allow for stretching. Unless you are super skinny, it will not look flattering. FYI I am 5'3 around 115.
B0031U0PAG|5|Nice sturdy belt. Very well made with a nice look for jeans or work pants.
B005HAPC56|5|Typical Carhartt. TOUGH, well-constructed. Comfortable.Huge choice of sizes. It's particularly useful in the woods, where brush and tree branches can't snag it, yet the sanded finish helps keep it quiet. Insulation is not super thick, so get it large enough for layering. I bought it with a [[ASIN:B0085TF00I Carhartt Men's Big-Tall 3 Season Sweatshirt]] in the same size and color for milder days and to line this jacket on the coldest days. l also have a couple of their watch caps, face mask, and scarf. Cool, cold, coldest -- I have it covered with Carhartt. Tried on and purchased on sale at our local Tractor Supply.
B006HT4EOQ|5|yes
B00BCN90NM|5|Just like the picture.  It is perfect and mailed and received on time.
B00BTYOIN6|5|I have had so many compliment from other professional about the subtle imagery in the print.  Kids also love it
B00GTXJ3OG|5|love
B009DSD2GO|4|Rated as 4 star instead of 5 because the color is much MUCH darker than what appears online.  These shorts are a true dark navy.
B00I1EQW36|3|Cute suit. Fast shipping. Good quality. I ordered a size medium since all reviews said to order a size bigger, but it was way too big for me. At least it was cheap so I didn't lose out on too much money.
B00279IT0U|5|wore it to my own wedding may 2012. great bow tie for a great price.<br />i'd say its just as nice as any etsy bow tie for half the price
B000J45DRC|4|The Mrs. likes it, it fits well, looks decent, and allows easy nursing.
B008VPQTWE|5|I am very impressed with this product and would recommand it to every on. The materal is very comfortable, the wast band is top quality and the price is outstabding.
B00NF3EF7I|4|I got these as a gift and they've just arrived. I haven't opened the package or worn them since they aren't for me, but they look good. You can tell what it is supposed to be.
B00367P53Q|5|The dress was exactly the same as in picture. I got the red one and fits perfectly. I am def going to be buying more colors in this dress!!!
B009AE2O92|3|I had a pair of these previously, absolutely loved them. Decided to order another pair and they must have made the gloves bigger. I ordered a women's medium the same that I had before and it does not fit as snuggly. They are a little big and fall off my hands. They are still great gloves! Warm and super convenient for phone use on the go. I love the design of only having one or two fingers exposed in order to use you phone. Brilliant.
B004LQ05XG|5|very pleeeezed!  Fit is perfect..Wasn't sure if the fit would be accurate ordering online..Very happy with product..I'll b ordering again...
B004A8OKXG|5|A nice quality hat that is embroidered well.  It is worth the reasonable cost very easily.  If you like the C&NW this is the hat.
B007RLY3MQ|2|it is acceptable, but they need to have the version with the airborne tab as part of it...
B000ULU9O6|5|They are great just as expected
B00KR9HMH8|5|Good quality arrived quickly
B009IS59E2|5|I love these socks because they do not slip at all....cover half of teh top of my foot for comfort and do not show through. I have treid other brands but love these best
B0083EZD7A|1|You know those costumes, that you buy your kid for Halloween? Yeah it's that bad, and whatever I paid for it, was way too much. It must be a foreign company, because there is No American, that would put the flag on that Substandard material. I am truly amazed!! And highly offended!!!
B00C6PMOHE|5|I got these for my son who has some issues with his hair.  He is able to wear these in school  and they have given him a little more confidence..
B00117IVVG|5|True to their name I have not experienced the dreaded \\"wedgie\\" while wearing these panties.  I was hesitant at first to buy them because I was a \\"100% cotton\\" kinda gal.  Even in the summer I have been comfortable wearing these.  Highly recommended.
B001D07Y00|5|After reading a few negative reviews on the durability of this wallet, I decided to give it a try anyway. It's been a couple of months now and this wallet is still holding up very well. It stays pretty compact (Flat) even though I have quite a few cards in it and thats what I was looking for. My old wallet developed that round lump in the middle, which left me sitting in a position that contributes to back pain. I'm happy with my purchase and I would recommend this wallet to anyone looking for a wallet made of pretty durable material.
B005ZZBIM4|4|Leggings are hawwt! After first wear it will fit right onto you without incident or constriction. And they look amazing.
B00DMEFORK|5|I think it's just beautiful and for the price, you can't beat it.  Thanks!
B00KH6IGPS|5|Have worn the tie several times and I love it.  The clip ons are so much more manageable for me, at my age, and knarled fingers.  Thank you.
B00KCVUD36|2|The quality is ok, but the product is not the same as in picture, it doesn't include the pants.
B00C01MEQA|5|Perfect for the XS, S and M ladies with flat abs, slender hips and full backsides. I do NOT recommend these shorts for the L and XL ladies with soft tummies or fuller hips; try the denim-colored \\"Pasion\\" bermuda shorts instead.
B004U7UJ5K|5|Cute and a great price! It was very decent quality and lightweight enough to dear clothes under without over heating. The colors are very vibrant and the fabric is decently soft and comfortable. The hat was SUPER cute, we kept it as a keepsake. :) perfect for that 1 time trick or treat use that one year olds need!
B00RW3CLVE|5|I express how much I love these Capri pants. They are comfortable and fit well. As someone who is a large size, it can be difficult to find pants that fit well, look good, and feel good. These fit the bill so well that I ordered one in black and in gray!
B00B73ATSC|5|Awesome undies, exactly what I wanted. Makes my ass look good, front not so flattering as I have a bit of a belly and it rides quite low at the front. But I don't think anyone's going to particularly care. I got the black pair, and I intend to buy more. Just a shame there isn't much variety in colours.
B00GBVTH5G|4|They are very nice slacks and we are happy with them.  The waist runs a bit big, as compared with other size 40 slacks and shorts I have bought recently.  Took them to the alterations lady and she fixed them and they are now perfect!  I may order some in size 38 waist to see if they fit better for my husband.  They are really nice slacks.
B00M185G8K|5|These are darling. My almost-2 year old thinks they're great. I like the waterproof lining, but they (as others mentioned) don't hold a whole huge pee. Cute and soft though! Great for training.
B00PR9V83M|5|Fits as expected. good quality of fabric but does'nt look as on the website but looks great any way . quick delivrery.
B00IY62BQS|3|Good quality but a looser fit than what I expected
B008VHFU5O|5|Thick material is sewn well and came out of the laundry unwrinkled.  Only thing my hubby didn't like so much is that there is no top button, so unless you enjoy showing off a gold chain or man hair you will need an undershirt.  Almost runs small - meaning it still fit his size but snugger than other XL's.
B00KD78Q6K|5|looks awesome.
B009EV0U56|5|I love this purse charm, however, it is rather large.  It seems to be well made and sturdy. It has multiple uses, too.
B001M8HFEI|4|ok
B00LPP5N60|5|I love this hat so much it really helps when im out fishing on the boat, it has a perfect fit for anyone
B008M11242|4|Bought this for my 8yr old son. Was able to adjust the strap nicely to fit the youth head.
B00B1PIY9C|5|Really cute dress.
B000P2Y39W|5|I love these socks...for perennially cold feet and feet that like a little cush-i-ness they are wonderful.  I have solid colors.  I don't trust the designed ones because a set from another manufacturer did not have the the yarns fixed properly and they unraveled and left polyester fur all over the house.  I am still cleaning up, after 2 weeks, and will never by those again.  These wash well, but they take a while to dry, and I that was in the sun room!  So if you must use the dryer I would recommend one of those small laundry bags to protect your socks.
B00G4JTW4G|4|For the age I bought it will be used a lot for dress up.  Was disappointed that the dress has some slight tear in it when we got it.
B00SDL8TG0|5|I love these sock look very nice
B00L4HV21O|1|I am not a big person, 125 lbs, 5 foot 6 inches. I could not get these even over my calf up to my thigh unless I stretched them out which would ruin them. Not sure if I got a faulty pair or what the issue is. I will be returning and ordering something else.
B001TCG14C|4|This item was satisfactory and delivered promptly. The fabric is soft and comfortable, these tights can make a fun addition to any adult costume.
B003VVR7UG|2|These socks are too tight even for just born. My son hated when I tried to put them on him, it looks like they are defective and been sold online.
B004YT4OS2|2|I bought this as a Halloween costume for my fiancé. The shorts are acceptable, given that I wasn't expecting much. But even with my expectations being as low as they were, I was shocked at the shoddy handsmanship on the bra. The cupcake part was just a thin sheet of foamy stuff that wrinkled and bent whenever he moved. One side was concave while the other was convex. It was a bit of a disaster, and if I had not bought it as a gag-costume, I'd be even more disappointed.
B00GOMS18Q|5|They don't slip.  Love them!
B00HFGPSYK|4|It's a very nice warm snowsuit :)
B00UMT2QEC|2|Not real leather<br />Only owned this belt since May and the layers are becoming unglued.nice buckle but the belt won't hold up.
B00N5PQ5XI|5|Awesome ordered 3
B00DHKYVL4|5|Very good quality. Fits exactly as described. Really nice shirt. The bicep-hugging sleeves are a nice touch. Good purchase!
B003EEMHUA|4|I love love love this sweatshirt!! It keeps me toasty warm, even when it's chilly outside. I really like that it has lining in the pockets also, so that my hands don't freeze!<br />Two drawbacks: there are no strings for the hood - which is a tad too big so can blow off in the wind, and the bottom isn't fitted - it has this pre-stretched-out look because it was made without elastic.<br />But otherwise, great sweatshirt!!
B00PGU6QHK|4|darker than in the picture, but they are so soft and fit nicely
B00DCCE1TY|2|this t-shirt was not bad but it looks a lighter color online. i want to believe its a different shirt i got
B00KEQN4R6|5|Excelent
B00DZPCV40|5|I have ordered these before.  I always order the same style.  They are very comfortable and offer a bit of control.
B00NVILB4C|5|Fun to wear!
B00ID45KBO|1|might as well be the material of a trash bag.. looks very different than in the picture.. not flattering at ALL
B004M6UDC8|5|It was Great
B004D1WKL4|5|1. Stays slim with 6cards and cash.<br />2. The color is fantastic!<br />3. 20€ bills and all Croatian Kunas fits perfectly.<br />4. Outstanding quality<br /><br />Worth every single penny!
B003UEEY0K|5|Nice and soft, easy to adjust and comfortable for a very active person.  It keeps the ears nice and warm.
B00NPNTORY|5|great winter socks. soft and slouchy.
B001AEUKLE|5|A very nice looking and fitting hat, especially for the money.
B003S28N10|4|Great costume especially for the price! I'm about 5'5 and 120 lbs and the small/medium fit perfectly. I would recommend this costume. Does have a bit of a weird smell so I recommend airing it out before wearing.
B0078FX16U|1|Picture distorted
B00L4JLABY|5|thanks you really did good job good product ....thanks
B00FFL73L8|3|Okay, but I prefer my socks thicker and also stretchier -- a bit tough to get on and off for my liking.
B00OB16JMM|5|This dress is beautiful and fits true to size.
B00ZT3XINE|4|This is a beautiful blue color and is very festive. Nice and lightweight for the spring and summer.  It fits well. Will probably need to be ironed which I'm not a fan of.  I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B00GBMATCA|2|Too small.
B00CH3B5B6|5|It is very cute. Got shipped to me very quickly. Fits perfect. I like the length of it, it isn't to short but it isn't to long.
B00QW4QDAE|5|Fits for curves I bought according to my size 5'4'. 150-160 Dress size med large.would've been too big but I like how it slims ur bodys curves and the color was ddf pink I'm getting the Gray one my chest size is DD 36 so it fit fine !length was great just belowy knees cuz I'm short I guess
B002KDMB84|5|Just what I was looking for.
B003NJNX5O|5|This is awesome, I should have bought 3!!
B00O2IIP6W|2|Not the material I thought it was.
B00IVW3Q8W|5|I am very happy with this purchase. I have been looking for something like this for a while, but could'nt seem to find the right color. This was perfect. I really like the little bit of stretch it has. I would definitely recommend this seller to others. Thanks for the great service.
B002DRQICW|5|I've always been a big fan of the Field Jacket liner, but the new waffle shirt is about 12 times as good.
B0075MNRLU|4|Great for teens-adults, but for children maybe not so much. The product is great, but its a bit too big for a kid. In any case it will look great even just as decoration on their room until they can fit it properly.
B002TQ7I62|3|I have other colours in this same top, fits well. Size runs big though. I got XS, in 113 pounds and its loose on me, That's the smallest available size, but its workable for those bloated days lol. Also when washed there are these little balls that form on the material. But the cute design makes up for it. It arrived well packaged and on time.
B00E0OEVAC|4|I use these whenever I wear unruly polos.  It does the trick....unless it's windy outside.  I wish they would anchor, but that's not what these are designed to do.
B006WX2NPO|5|I haven't worn it yet, but I gave it 5 stars because it was exactly as pictured and the dress is perfect
B00FN5TCLK|3|generally it is good , but i think it need water proof nylon on it back to make it more useful .
B00J8A70NI|4|very comfortable
B00L31DNI6|5|Bought it for myself (as a lady) and ordered a medium as I like some roomier shirts only this was more large size. My husband wears a larger and he can wear it. Looks like we will have to figure who keeps it. Oh the problems with two nerds in this house.
B00LYHPMHO|5|I love pigs and I love purple  I have been collecting pig items for over 20 years  this is perfect for me!! This came in great shape. This is an awesome seller👍👍
B000QU6904|5|I love these shorts so much I ordered two more pair. I like the way they fit. Look good long or rolled up. I Highly recommend them.
B004V8F3XG|3|The product came promptly. It was bought for a gift and someone else bought the same person a similar item. The other scale seemed sturdier and could easily be use by one person alone. The Newline Scale seemed more awkward to use by oneself.  If I had not seen the other one, this one would have probably been fine. I am not sure how they compared price-wise. It was my impression that the other one was not significantly more and would last longer. Sadly, it is costing me over $5.00 to return.
B004GO8BI4|3|This jacket had arrived in a box way too small for it and so it was terribly wrinkled.  The seller credited my account with $20.00 so that I could have the jacket steam cleaned.  I have given them 3 stars.  I have not given 5 stars because this should never have happened to begin with and now I have to schlep it off to be steamed.  ......but they did try.  Thank you.
B00GLQCDG6|5|Bigger than I expected but it's a very cozy and comfortable shirt. The best part is the pockets!
B00IX10S4G|5|Love this swim top!
B00OXWFCP4|5|It was a gift for my grandson, everyone in the house loves it. Now they want one.
B00KDC8A8Y|5|Bought for my girlfriend she was interested in trying this, good to test the waters to see how serious you want to get
B008X9ZDLG|5|Fit fine
B00J73QLAE|5|the pants are as they look and the colors are lovely. the pants are inexpensive, thus the quality is on par with the price. but you get what you pay for, and when i buy pants for 9 bucks (or whatever they were) i know they're not going to last forever.<br />there was an issue with shipping since i moved, but i contacted the seller and they handled it quickly which i appreciated very much.<br />for $9, they're great.
B00IPIQJYK|5|These are the best panties I have been able to find anywhere and I wish they would renew their supply of all of the colors and start making them again. This is the only kind of sexy lace, mostly cotton underwear I've been able to find, anywhere on the face of the earth.<br />Please make more of these in the previous colors Barely There! The black and pink was the best!
B00IVFYF34|4|Very light in weight with a kind of nubby feel and somewhat loose fitting.
B00BXLC1HA|2|Poor fit. Sleeves way too short.
B00I8P9YSI|5|I'm 5'2 119 pounds and a 32DDD victoria secret what size is good I was wondering if mediam is good ? What size
B00RVAJQW0|2|The shirt took a long time to ship, and I hadn't realized that this would be shipping directly from China. With that being said though, the package did arrive secure and was well sealed/protected. The shirt was shipped with a very noticeable defect, and blemish on the front of shirt making it unwearable; It was a large white mark that showed up very glaringly against the dark coloring of the shirt. It should also be noted that the pattern in the picture isn't very distinguishable from a distance; The shirt is very dark grey with the black design - it is not as pictured so bright & detailed. Also, the shirt was a full 2&#34; inches (5cm) shorter than other Large sized shirts I've purchased here in the U.S; This did not allow the shirt to be ticked in, or to even slightly extend beyond my waist line - as most of my other t-shirts do.
B0010Z18K0|5|I got my cooler today & it was definatly worth waiting for!!! Well worth 50 points! The best item on here, guess that's why it was on back-order.It is bigger than it looks in the picture. Get this cooler,you won't be disappointed!I give it 10 stars!!!
B006QGBTXE|4|i love this lightweight loose-fit shirt. used this while touring around Bangkok on a hot and humid day. wore a tanktop underneath for a decent coverage on the tummy area (especially when lifting the arms, LOL).
B00F93GL1U|5|Warm and perfect.  I have large hands for a woman (man hands :) but I wanted fingerless gloves that made me feel dainty.  These are perfect. Delivery to U.S. will take a month, otherwise no complaints. Thick tight cable knit, will last a couple seasons.  Keeps my hands very warm.  Order now so u can have by spring... Just kidding. :)
B0073E564G|1|It looks really tacky
B0050SC78A|5|Love it, matches perfectly with my scarf and is super warm. It is a little large for me but that may be due to the fact I have a small head.
B00AAJIQQ6|5|Nicest pair of gloves I've ever had and at a very reasonable price. Warm and attractive.
B010UB3QP4|5|The material is really nice, looks good, and arrived after only 6 days.
B00C5WM48W|3|The fit of these jeans is fine, but I am not as bowled over as I hoped I'd be.
B005HJXANS|5|It's great and quick delivery.
B004OA7QT0|5|I just love baby clothes. I think it's because they are so small. Either way I am very happy with the material softness and overall make of these bodysuits. I think my favorite feature is the double snaps for growth. This is such a great feature especially for those fast growing babies!<br /><br />I'm comparing the Disney Bodysuit to the Gerber Bodysuit and I have to say at first glance there really is no comparison. The Disney Bodysuit looks to be better made with a slightly thicker cloth than Gerber. The leg bands are a little wider and the comfort would appear to be the same. Washing they did shrink up a little bit however so did Gerber and one can expect that from 100% Cotton. This bodysuit will make an excellent little cover-up for those hot summer months. Very happy with this and I would repurchase for later.
B008S9C5US|4|I'm 6'5'' 215lbs and generally wear 36x34 or 36x36 pants. I'm glad I listened to the other reviews and bought a size up, 38x36. The pants fit around the belly button where most pants these days ride around your hips/waist so buy accordingly. The material is a bit stiff but softens a little after washing. I wish the side pockets were a bit deeper. The front crease is a nice added touch for a more professional look.
B00NNIELYC|5|It is a beautiful Shirt.
B00VSXF1WA|4|I love this top. The fabric is light weight and very soft. Also stretches nicely. It goes just above the naval and if very flattering on. I love the way this feels. I bought a small. Fits perfectly. I'm 5'4&#34; 120lbs..      I'm adding to this review because I bought a second shirt in red, and the red does NOT fit like the Leopard print at all. The cut is very wide around the arm pits, making the bra show alot and it is much looser all over. The material is the same.. stretchy and soft.
B00MNYI5P8|3|I had putchase before from Children's Place, I don't like the fact that the picture on these shirt is stich instead of just a print, reason why this can irritate baby delicate skin. I purchase several sets had I known I wouldn't have bought these.
B00I7T20FE|2|Very sheer material. No tag, no name or logo inside clothing. Came thrown in a bag unwrapped and super wrinkled. Fit ok, did not ride up or fall down.
B00D86T9QY|5|good
B002Y3Y7D2|3|Ordered this friday, got it monday morning but no tracking. Quality is kind of poor of the material (feels synthetic) and the pin feels cheap and even though I measured my head, I should have gone with an XL instead.<br /><br />Overall I like it, but maybe not quite for the asking price.
B001IHZD3S|4|This house dress fit the need to stay cool this summer but it is very thin material. I have men in my house that don't care to be seeing through my dress.
B00AC4VWV0|5|I felt like Marilyn Monroe! I bought it 1 size bigger because they said it cut small, I wear an 8/9 and I bought a size 10. It fit all my curves. I just had to take up the lenght because I am 5' 4&#34;, It was worth every penny! the quality of the material was nice and heavy and looks rich, not shiney. I wore it for my mother's 65th birthday on June 1st.
B00L32QKHG|2|It somewhat Small and thin!!!
B00IEU91TE|5|A perfect addition to my UK wardrobe!!
B009SLBG6Y|5|As discribed
B00IA8PPPO|5|Love this it's SUPER sexy!
B00D6P30KS|3|I wanted to love this coat, I almost talked myself into keeping it. The wool is soft, the lining is luxurious, and it looked great from the front. Unfortunately I have a sway back which means my rear sticks out a fair bit, and this caused the coat to bunch up in the back. There is no button to pin down the flap/vent at the shoulders, so it stuck out unless I stretched my arms in front of me like superman. The chest area of the coat was a bit too roomy, and the bottom portion of the coat was not structured for someone with my build. I'm sure it would work for someone a little less curvy in the back, and a little bigger on top.
B00GY0INMW|2|And it dosent contrain very well with the lace
B00902ZS1A|2|Somewhat small
B0081RKNXI|3|Cheap plastic dividers inside. Cards do not fit very well, easly broken
B0048KXSPM|5|I am so happy it fits great. I wear 32DD in other bras and ordered the same size in this, fits great.
