B00797MB0O|5.0|'Young adult' is now one of my favorite films ever!<br /><br />This film is brutal and realistic, it is quite unexpected.<br /><br />Be prepared.<br /><br />Charlize is amazing, what a woman!  The whole cast is fabulous, Patton Oswald makes this role look like he was born to play it!<br /><br />The plot is very well written, the details, the pace, only superlatives here!<br />Just the expressions on the protagonist's face are a world of their own!<br /><br />To be brutal, you might hate the film if u r too brainwashed into the Pollyanna crap.
B0015KO52S|5.0|This is one of my favorite sets of Jack White songs. This guy has tremendous range... in fact, sometimes too wide. Just because one Can do almost anything doesn't mean one Should. That said, he pretty much stays within the confines of being fun or enthralling to listen to here without getting into some of those boring-to-hang-in-there-for esoteric corners he can indulge himself in, yet here he also has so much range of style and mood that each song demands attention. There are some songs where I swear this guy is channeling Robert Plant...

0307352153|3.0|As an introvert, I was eager to read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. Unfortunately, the book did not live up to my expectations. If you're looking for an easy read, this isn't it. The content is good, but it's a deep, heavy read. I am normally a fast reader, but I could not plow through this book quickly. The book is divided into four parts: 1) the extrovert ideal which focuses on how our society prefers extroverts to introverts, 2) your biology, your self? which considers if temperament is a product of nature or nurture, 3) do all cultures have an extrovert ideal? which looks beyond the American landscape, and 4) how to love, how to work which addresses interacting with the opposite type and helpful tips for raising quiet kids. All in all, I found this book to be a decent read but not one I would heartily recommend to a friend.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review, but the opinions expressed in this post are mine.
0307891372|4.0|If you want a hard copy stategy guide and don't want to print off a bunch a internet pages and make your own 3 ring binder, I would definetly recommend this.<br />Most everything in this is available for free on-line if you have time to blow scrounging the web. If you like it organized and hard copy, this is a good alternative to printing your own and sorting it out.<br />However, it costs more to buy it this way.<br />I just don't have the time or patience to do another 3 ring binder like I did with Oblivion.<br />I had less money and more time on my hands when I did the internet option, but this was perfect for a busy person who wants a good strategy guide.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season three (3) of the British/Masterpiece Theater's \\"Downton Abbey\\" on three (3) discs occurs between the two \\"great\\" wars.  Yes, the series continues its very high standards that were established in the previous series--fine writing, acting, direction and recreation of the era.  I, however, found Season three (3) of Downton Abbey\\" to be even more intriguing because, to me , what's called the \\"real world\\" (aka reality) \\"burst\\" the \\"fairy-tale  world\\" existence shared by the inhabitants of Downton Abbey even the very hard working \\"downstairs\\" help that primarily lived in the \\"upstairs (aka upper-class)  shadows.<br /><br />Having survived World War I and the running of a rehabilitation center for wounded soldiers, Season three (3) finds all of the inhabitants of Downton Abbey desirous of getting  back \\"to the way it was\\".  In spite of much effort from the downstairs' help and tremendous effort from the \\"rich folk\\" the aforesaid does not happen.  Even the \\"saintly\\" Earl of Grantham (wonderfully acted by Hugh Bonneville) loses his \\"grip\\" on things by making \\"bad' investments and stubbornly sticking to the \\"old ways\\" that threaten the existence of Downton Abbey and making some very bad decisions.  I really enjoyed this more \\"human\\" side of the Earl.  Much to the dismay of the \\"upstairs' folks\\" and much to the horror of the Earl of Grantham, the so-called \\"real world\\"  strike the  upstairs' folk of Downton  Abbey in the forms of death, an American mother-in-law (superbly acted by Shirley Maclaine--a great foil to the wonderful Maggie Smith), shortness of staff, the \\"wrong kind\\" of  son-in-laws plus their insubordination, marital riffs, women not willing to stay in their \\"place\\" and sip tea, a\\"jilting\\" at the wedding altar, pesky staff's lives invading the rarified worlds of the upper class, difficult relatives, sudden demises of precious loved ones--in other words \\"real life\\" invades Downton abbey's elite world plus it also brings some unhappiness to the downstairs' folk.<br /><br />In Season three (3) of Downton Abbey, we find the downstairs' help working very hard (what wonderful characters that are acted greatly)  and enduring the evasion of the \\"real\\" world that includes the threat of cancer, shortness of help,  the \\"wrong kind of help\\", rivalries,  jealousies, lust and in-fighting.  One of the highlights is the betrayal by Thomas of the dastardly upstairs/ladies' maid O'Brien and her horrible revenge on him--for once, I felt very sorry for Thomas.<br /><br />All-in-all, I really enjoyed Season three (3) of Downton Abbey; this season, for me, was the best.  Season three (3) is so greatly acted, written and directed.  The location shots along with the costumes are breathtaking.  Per usual, Maggie Smith is delightful--I adore her. (By the way, there are plenty of extras--such as interviews with the actors, writers, directors and behind the scenes features--that I enjoyed alot)
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is one of those books that stick with you well after the last word is read. The characters are so knowable and so dear you wonder was this \\"really\\" a novel? Really?
B00746O3X8|5.0|This is a great harness, and better than expected. It's almost easier to &#34;figure it out yourself&#34; than to study the diagrams ... couple of hints:<br /><br />1) the &#34;disk locks&#34; that go into the tripod mount are well made ... and a small triangular screwdriver is provided so you can have it with you. There is a secondary &#34;channel&#34; on the same side as the screw head ... tighten that PARALLEL to the body of the camera (in other words running the length of the bottom of the camera). That way you slide the camera (pointing to your left) down into the receiver grooves of the holster, and lower lens toward ground to &#34;lock.&#34; It won't come out of the lock! :-) ... you could be suspended upside down and it won't disengage once locked. To remove quickly, swivel lens again to the left and lift gently. SWEET!<br /><br />2) Cinch up the lower waist strap as tight as you can stand it. This is easier done by unbuckling and removing the harness, tightening both sides, and putting the &#34;rig&#34; back on again. Once it's &#34;military tight,&#34; the whole thing takes on a firmness you (I) didn't think possible, and yet it's comfortable. I can imagine this being comfortable/cool to wear even on a 100+ day.<br /><br />3) the &#34;emergency catch&#34; straps are great but I don't think I'll even use them. I will instead use my Tamrac straps on the camera, around my neck. If that's not your taste, you can use the safety straps or not ... but the disk locks are VERY secure.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with this harness, period. Fantastic buy.

Have to return it as it has no use.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I was never a huge fan of the original Angry Birds. However, I'm a big Star Wars fan, so I decided to give this game a try. I'm glad I did. You could take out the Star Wars aesthetic and this would still be a great game.
1606865617|4.0|This book is amazing that it portrayed a very evil woman in a positive light.<br /><br />Amu is responsible for ending an illustrious family who reigned in the city for many years.<br /><br />She caused disgrace in the family by mating with the wrong kind of men, and indirectly caused the death of the last heir of the family.<br /><br />Her \\"bastards\\", her comrades in crime, are no better. Rachel, the daughter, managed to ensnare an American into marriage, which lasted just long enough for her to earn her green card (as seen in her extended stay in New York). Estha, the son, became a good-for-nothing.<br /><br />The baby aunt, portrayed as evil in the book, was the one holding the family's honor intact. Also, Chacko, Amu's brother, was probably too good on Amu and her bastards. He did pay for Rachel's education, despite of what the latter did to his child.<br /><br />Amu, despite of causing the death of her lover in addition to all of the above, goes on living for a few more years before dying of natural cause, never expressing any guilt or shame to the destruction she caused. Truly a remarkably evil woman indeed.

0553208845|5.0|Over the years, a few misconceptions have dogged this book. A significant one is the title of the book itself. It needs to be clarified that the book is not yet another story about the Buddha (despite the fact that Siddhartha is the name the Buddha was christened with and there is also some resemblance between the two lives.) Nor is it simply an exegesis of the main precepts of Buddhism - nor about religion and god for that matter. In a roundabout way it does have echoes of Buddhism as the book's main theme is about the protagonist's search for a particular worldview, a certain weltanschauung, a way of life that is meaningful - which is what Buddhism perhaps is essentially about. As part of this journey, Siddhartha experiments with not only the life of an ascetic but also with that of a merchant, a lover and a family man. Ultimately, he transcends the various lives and vocations he has been involved in (including that of the monk too).<br /><br />While describing this quest, Hesse weaves brilliantly into the tale the essential metaphysic of Buddhism, Hinduism and other belief systems. The book is also interlaced with some subtle and evocative parallels to the legends and characters from these creeds. For example, Vasudeva is the name of the ferryman Siddhartha befriends and who later becomes Siddhartha's teacher. Vasudeva of course is another name for Krishna who, as Arjuna's charioteer in the great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, teaches the latter the efficacy of dispassion, the importance of fulfilling one's duty and selfless action and the liberation of the self. Similarly, the river features as a metaphor for time in the epistemic discussions between Vasudeva and Siddhartha. This echoes Heraclitus's famous dictum that no one steps into the same river twice. You could therefore say that the book is about looking for universal truths as a pathway to freedom from life's travails.<br /><br />This short book is therefore worth delving into during those times when you feel that there is something missing in your life and wish to get away - at least for a few moments - from those fights with windmills and wish to experience instead a reality check or a memento mori that will remind us of the ephemerality of these quotidian battles.eel that there is something missing in your life and wish to get away - at least for a few moments - from those fights with windmills and wish to experience instead a reality check or a memento mori that will remind us of the ephemerality of these quotidian battles.

0307719774|5.0|Order from amazon they ship within 3days with regular shipping awesome!!! Beware the book is not large check the dimensions first to see if that is a deal breaker for you. Also the book is thick because there's 365 pages for the 365 days in the year. So you can't really open the book flat so if that's a deal breaker beware. But I love it and can't wait to start writing in it :)

B0030V0PEW|5.0|Great anecdotes and some data on the value of checklists.  Surely poses the question - why not?  Doesn't contain too much about how to actually go about developing a checklist, but offers enough to tantalize.  I'm sold and will be working to develop some checklists to help in my profession.  Great read.
1609611543|2.0|I don't know about this. I'm  sure there are some people that wheat bread will cause bad health, but I believe in moderation. If you are &#34;FAT&#34; cut back by up to  50% of your food intake. That is what I did several years ago. I went from 225 to 185 by just eating about half of what I normally ate and it did not very long to loose it.  If you are sedate very little food is needed,  but you must eat a balanced diet for good health.

B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  The music is wonderful and the show is certainly not as bad as some of the reviews indicate.  It was recorded live but you miss out on the audience throughout the show.  That made it feel more like a movie then a show.  If you are a Phantom fan, see this one.

B00A1U2SVS|5.0|This was the concert to see and hear.  I saw Zep in 1975 and it was amazing and this was no less.  The chops that Jason Bonham brought to the party filled the void of John and the production was superb.  A must for any Zep fan.
0811879542|5.0|This is a must-have for your child or for a gift!  I gave this book to all my friend's kids this past Christmas.  It's thick, hard cardboard so it's not easy to rip.

B009KS4XRO|2.0|I don't really like this game.  Not really a BINGO player I guess.  Others seem to be enjoying it online.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|This was a special read for me as I grew up watching June Allyson play Jo March in the 2nd movie remake. It was interesting to read all the similarities between the book and all movie versions, but I also enjoyed the stories that were not included in any of the movies. Interestingly, I enjoyed many of the lessons regarding growing up and marriage that I feel still ring true in our current times.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was my favorite book out of all of them because it seemed more epic than ever. Almost everyone  hates this book just cuz it's boring  but I think they did not read it all of the way<br />I hope everyone loves

ONE OF DENZELS BEST ACTING ROLES.  BUT LIKE I SAY DENZEL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS.  THE REASON FOR THAT IS 40,000 MOVIES IN MY COLLECTION TELLS ME SO.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.....
B001JIDE3M|3.0|Its a family movie but it seem so so.  Not to bad.  Kids might find it entertaining more.  Probably watch only 1 time though.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|This CD has a great sound, family appropriate, surprisingly well-rounded. I ordered it because of my daughter,s release date countdown!
B004IDG97S|3.0|Show is ok.  From its style of armor that i was sure could protect a skateboard accident that somehow protected them from bullets.  The show is fun.  But the new dredd I really like.  This show was more fun and enternaing for jokes and remarks.  I like the detail of the background on this show.  Tells me much of judge dredd.  The new one well i really like that one.  Seem more comic based.  Very hard character to play out and in a movie and be good.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I saw the 25th anniversary documentary on PBS and felt inspired to revisit this album.  It's truly engaging, fun, and a literal love song to South African music for the Western listener.

B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Its probably really fun to watch for those that havent watched the orginal.  The original was kind of fun and hokie.. err best word i could use.  This one be a 4 star if i handnt know the story from the original.  Its likely be fun for others who havent.  This one I think is better than original mostly cause of better animation but i give marks on the original of putting more confusion to the story hehe.  Some still fight over the ending on the original.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game. Once I start playing I can't put it down. If you like temple run you will love 2
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Sadly this movie I thought would be fun to watch but.  For me it became more predictable and sadly that says it all.  It really didnt go in debt with the characters.  I like plot stories so if the story is predicable then the characters debt sometimes help really carry the movie balancing it out.  It really didnt.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is one of the better puzzle games. Even though some of the puzzles were repeated, they were different and usually harder, more complex versions. Playing against time by level, rather than by individual puzzle, was also a definite plus.

0425252868|5.0|This is a exciting, factual account of two pilots, one an American, and one a German, whose paths crossed in the World War II and the trials and tribulations that both pilots faced as the war progressed.

B009NQKXYK|3.0|Not what I expected, but it does follow the &#34;tried and true&#34; path of a science fiction movie. It is a bit long.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book, all E L James from 50 shades to Freed I wished their were more books. I'm sad it ended its a  bittersweet feeling. And now I wait until I hear the news that the books will have a movie like twilight.<br /><br />I'm in love
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite magic systems.  The characters are incredibly detailed for such a short story and the world is beautiful.  I cannot recommend it enough.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|This movie had a lot of promise, but it was sadly not able to reach that promise. The actors, as a group, should have been able to create a wonderful tale, but they did not work together all that well. The story should have been good, but just lagged like a dead dog in a whole raft of places. You end up with a movie that is almost work to get through. I would suggest that if you want to watch a movie from this era you watch anything else because no movie could be worse than this one.
0761171703|4.0|We have enjoyed this book, although it would be much more impactful as a hardcover &#34;coffee table book&#34; and culled a little -- some of the pictures are too obvious/unimaginative and dilute the book (for example, the girl in flowing white on a tree swing...why wasn't this perhaps a boy looking ready to leap or squirm off, capturing that emotion of childhood challenge and adventure instead of a boring overdone romantic-girl stereotype?).  But, the majority of the pictures are very imaginative and expressive, and capture the emotion of an everyday situation in a creative and enjoyable way, and I find myself reminded of them in various situations.in my day-to-day life.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It would help if they did other things,I also felt they need a few other characters in the story so they had other things to do.
B009AMAK54|5.0|Fantastic will watch over and over again well worth the price clean family movie love clint eastwood another one of his great movies
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Amazing! Great read and goes by really fast.  I would recommend to anyone who is interested in reading a thriller book!
044024367X|4.0|Another solid Reacher effort. A little over the top with the small town names, but hey, who says life--and fiction--doesn't need whimsy?<br /><br />One thing that Child consistently does and does again with Nothing to Lose is brilliantly set up his plot and character motivations in the smallest ways over and over again, so even though you may not agree with a turn or even believe that it's plausible, you can't look at the author and say he didn't back himself up in the narrative. This is assuring to me as a reader and I really appreciate how Child does it.<br /><br />The characters are typically strong again and Child manages to build them right off the page. Simple settings are memorable and characters, even minor ones, are familiar signposts in the story.<br /><br />I can't recall a Reacher through the first dozen I wouldn't recommend, and Nothing to Lose adds to the list.
B005GIS1SY|5.0|The bright colors, funny/moving  music, and story line were so wonderful!  My grandson had watched it before and still loves seeing it again and again.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Overindulgence with no weight gain unless you eat popcorn and drink beer while watching this extraordinary Blu-ray.<br />Your eyes and ears will thank you, particularly if you have a home theater system that can do the incredible video and DTS HD MA 7.1 96 kHz audio the justice it deserves.<br /><br />I purchased Samsara because of my ethusiasm for Baraka which I purchased years ago. The primary difference between the two is that the audio for Baraka was taken on location, while the audio for Samsara was added after the Video was editied. The quality of the audio is spectacular in both cases. Most of the music for Samsara was composed for the video.<br /><br />While both Samsara and Baraka are documentaries, Samsara elicits a visceral response and is thought provoking, while Baraka is more organic with a primitive religious tone. I found myself contemplating the enigmatic visages of the people photographed, wondering what was in their minds given the vast cultural and geographical gaps between us.<br /><br />Both are visual and auditory wonders and belong in your film collection.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is great for a freecell game. Only wish it had other solitaire games as well<br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I do
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a story about how a family is affected by changes that occur during and after the war. It keeps you wondering about their future and their happiness. Will the coming loss and changes tear them apart?
0385535139|3.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. This book is ok - but not great. I think the plot was rehashed<br />and not up to his usual style. I would not recommend this book.  Judge for yourself.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is great, my daughter downloaded it and she thinks it fab. Great game for all. And the games free which is even better:)
0307155102|5.0|The Best Word Book Ever is truly just that.  Children will be learning and reading quickly, or in addition<br />to their school learning program.  The book is a &#34;tool&#34; but also a delight.  Every family should have this<br />book in the home library.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I chose this rating because the book evoked a lot of emotion in me. I could relate in some places, and in those I didn't, I felt for Charlie.<br />I liked everything about this book.<br />I would recommend this to anyone over the age of about thirteen.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Already have on laptop. Wanted to have the ability to travel with Kindle Fire and have social media available and respond to.

B003TH2LYY|5.0|Castle is a great series.  But start watching it at the beginning to appreciate all the clever in-jokes and tie ins later in the series!  Wonderful characters, great writing and acting-- and Nathan Fillion is amazing; for Firefly/Serenity fans this is a MUST SEE series!
1401907725|5.0|These cards are beautiful to read through and very comforting. It helps to give insight into our world around us!
B000FC12SM|5.0|This book really helped me on my relationship with my girl friend, hope that this help other people who need help on their relationship
B004W2UBYW|4.0|If you like tech it is a fascinating read.  The start of the PC revolution, the first mac, the windows vs. mac struggles, Bill Gates, its all in there.  I found it very interesting and informative.  It contained some very good insights into what makes a business successful.  Its probably worth the read just for the business insights.  The life of Jobs was fascinating, both good and bad.  I found it a very good book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Keeps you coming back for more. Each season the group is looking for safety-- will they ever find it? Great acting

B005Q1W10A|5.0|all is well came upon a night when we needed something to watch and wanted to catch up on the  series. on time ex cond.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|THE STING is a highly loved film. This film was an event when it was first released. Sentimentally, it is a follow up, not in plot or characters, but in the same vein of the buddy film, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.  Once again Paul Newman and Robert Redford are teamed and once again this film is truly an event just as BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID was. However, the overall production creates a certain cinematic quality much different from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID. Visually, it is claustrophobic, yet this only enhances the dramatics. I am amazed at how little screen time Paul Newman has, yet his card playing and hard drinking Henry Gondorff visually define this film. Certainly this film brings Robert Redford back into the film-going public's eye. The plot is minimal and the pay-off, once viewed, is quite surprising, full of humor, drama and suspense. Robert Shaw as Doyle Lonnegan, the mark, is memorable and brings a level of believability to the plot as it unravels. The entire cast is impeccable and includes Charles Durning, Ray Walston, Eileen Brennan and Leonard Barr among others. Most memorable are Scott Joplin's ragtime compositions, adapted by Marvin Hamlisch. \\"The Entertainer\\" gained immortality from THE STING. THE STING is a film characterized by sentimentally endearing characters, dramatics, music and fun.
B002BWP49M|5.0|excellent arrived on time and the family is real happy as far as i know. i personally may watch it someday?
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This product has done exactly what I wanted it to and has been perfect. The only thing to note is that you should use a high-quality USB cable with it (one is provided). When I first heard that I didn't believe it, but after switching from my longer cord to the one they provided... Well, the difference was unbelievable. Great product and works under Windows 7 and Windows 8.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|takes alittle bit to get used to but a great game!!!<br />its scatter how there's one big monster instead of three!!!!!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|The previews made it look so much better then it was. I thought it was kind of confusing and a little boring.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, it was a page turner and I get wanting to know how the relationship worked out.
0375869026|5.0|I am so glad a friend recommended this book to me. I am an adult and I loved the book. My thirteen year old daughter loved the book. My mom will be reading it next, followed by my twelve year old and my nine year old. I laughed and I cried while reading. The words touched my heart and the story will stay with me forever.  A++++. Please read.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Took a while to get set up for streaming from away from home.Make sure that you are logged in to google voice on both computers.After that you a have a really great app.It does every thing that it says.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|As with book one, this is definitly adult reading!  However, the story line is great and I look forward to the final conclusion
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Easy to get into the story, and follow the lead, it has romance to make it thru the end. Fun.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think the graphics are highly irastional and I would suit for a more of a perticular and spacific of a game. I enjoy this more than the first but not more then minecraft will ever be. sincerely maw.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Everything about the flight and crash was truly excellent.  The rest fell short because instead of having a pilot who flew drunk and high, but within reasonable limits, they turned Denzel Washington's character into a stereotype...the dumbest, drunkest drunk you could imagine.  The problem with that is that you wind up hating his character even though it is a superb acting performance.<br /><br />The rest of the cast performed well and were believable.  (Well, John Goodman was a little over the top, but his character was likable.)<br /><br />If this movie had been about a pilot who performed heroically, but broke the FAA rules and generated some compassion for him, it would have been much better, in my opinion.<br /><br />I would have given this three stars, but the flight and crash segment were so well done, I gave it four.
B000002LAC|5.0|These 3 ladies have tremendous talent.  I bought this as a vinyl album when it came out in the early 1980's.  It popped into my memory and was very happy when I found it on Amazon in CD form.  I am once again singing along as loud as I can !!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so much fun! So worth paying $7!!! I just uploaded it and now it has signs! I can't wait for mine carts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-
B000002J0P|5.0|I bought this vinyl album in 1970 and was thrilled when I was able to find it in CD form on Amazon.  This is classic music and I will never tire of listening to it.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|I am an Austen fan, have read the books and wanted all of the DVD's, also like Jonny Lee Miller, thought it was a good  adaptation.  It is also cheaper than getting it through another vendor.
B008476HBM|5.0|Love it! A must read. Human character shown at its best and worst. I can't wait to read more Austen! This is my all time favorite of Austen's works. I can read it over and over. Watch the movie over and over with Kierra Knightly.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|I use this app at work and at home and it's been perfect. From recipes to measurements to weights and volume...everything in between.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Well trained dog.  How faithful dogs are to us.  Humans could learn from them.  Found the ending sad, but liked the fact that it was a true story.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is one of the best shows on Masterpiece Theater. Season 3 is out on DVD too. Don't miss it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyed another John Grisham book. True to his reputation, he has authored another captivating, realistic book. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B005FISBTO|3.0|Dexter is an excellent show...showtime is a greedy selfish company that clearly has only self interest in mind...unbelievable...netflix it is for the next season of Dexter.(although I am sure showtime gets royalties from this as well) Really showtime, how much money do you need? I will never, if I can help it, purchase showtime products again.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read it! I was touched by the ending.Read this book!No way is there any other book that is better than this one!!
B005LAII8K|1.0|I could always count on Bruce Willis movies being good.<br /><br />What happened here? Awful movie!<br /><br />Are you listening, Bruce?<br /><br />Now I can't.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Excellent app especially when it was the free app of the day.<br />Would have been quite happy to pay full price for it. Much easier to do than a nonogram in the paper.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I really am addicted to Castle. So much that I watch an episode at every break. I can't get enough of the show and the interaction of the characters.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Very good all in all. My first time using the amazon music cloud, still need to figure out how to download the songs. I enjoy the cd though for a mellow relaxing time.
B00A9T1HUO|1.0|I absolutely love the songs on this album! I am a Grobanite through and through, but I was disappointed in Illuminations in that I only like a few of the songs, whereas on his other albums I have liked most if not all of the songs.  This album reminds me more of his earlier albums.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Very exciting, and kept you on the edge of your seat at all times.  Everything made sense as a prequel to the Alien movies.  Very well done.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am a huge fan of the original Temple Run, and this sequel builds on all of the best qualities of its predecessor.  Fast-paced fun, challenging levels, and entertaining game play all add up to a definite winner in my book.  Highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. I have been a horse lover for years and my daughter wants a horse.. I love how this rescheduled that it is a lot of work.. a great way to kill time as well
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Violent but good, you learn to appreciate our Navy Seals even more. You don't want to miss a minute of this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read a lot...A LOT. And I haven't had a book in a LONG time give me so many twists. It may not be for everyone with the unrealistic romance (I'm a sucker for them) but the underlying drama is simply amazing. I would DEFINITELY recommend to everyone I know.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show! Storyline is unpredictable. Mrs. Grantham has the best lines of anybody and although she makes me cringe sometimes, I love her. Great acting from everyone in the cast.
B002IUKBJU|1.0|Would not play in the USA ment for England. Was sent back. Need to indicate the area it was made for!

B005C9YZPA|5.0|This is an awesome product. I was having a hard time figuring out what to buy my dad for Christmas and I decided to go with this. I'm so happy I did because he loved it! Since it is limited edition, it has a small plaque on the inside that tells you which number you have out of the 5000 that exist. The globe to hold all the DVDs makes this product even more unique from all the other packaging. It stands on it's own and can be even used as a center piece.<br /><br />However the best part about this product is the DVDs' content of course. Not only is it interesting, but it is also a learning experience! Not to mention the cinematography is awesome and they have done such a beautiful job of capturing nature.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product, it's definitely worth every penny!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Seriously, the best show on TV right now.  You can't imagine that a show about zombies would be anything more than blood and gore but this show has that AND so much more.  Great characters and story lines.  Can NOT wait for rest of the season premiering this Sunday!!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|This book is full of action.  Lee Child's writing puts you there.  At one point, it was so intense, I felt my stomach tighten up and I was reading faster and faster trying to see what happened.  I read the first Reacher novel and now I am going to read the 3rd novel.  Love it!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|game is too much like previous and doesn't have enough excitement.  Should have more categories of obstacles in the game.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Well, it's nicely written and easy to read although it seems (to me) that it<br />is VERY slow and going practically no where.  I haven't finished it and maybe<br />never will.
B009AMAGQM|4.0|I saw this movie at an advance screening even though there were 2 strikes against my possible enjoyment:  first, I'm much older than the demographic for the movie and second, I hadn't read the book ([[ASIN:0316042676 Beautiful Creatures]]).  Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />Because I haven't yet read the book (but intend to now that I've seen the movie), I can't comment on how true to the book it is, I can only evaluate it as a stand alone movie.  (See below for some differences I have read about in articles.)<br /><br />The first impressive thing is the cast.  This cast includes some amazing stars.  Jeremy Irons exuded Southern charm with a little smidgen of menace as Uncle Macon. Emma Thompson stole every scene she was in playing the dual role of Mrs. Lincoln/Sarafine and was fantastic when she was playing Sarafine playing Mrs. Lincoln (readers of the book will understand what I mean). When she and Jeremy Irons were in a scene together, it was something to watch.  Viola Davis played Amma (combined with the book character Marian who isn't in the movie), making her both a comforting figure and a little spooky.  Emmy Rossum pulled out her inner siren to play Lena's cousin Ridley.  I love Margo Martindale and wished there had been more of her role as Aunt Del.  I recognized the face, but not the name of the actress who played Gramma -- Eileen Atkins has a huge list of acting credits.  The actors who played Ethan and Lena did a great job as well, though they have much less acting experience.  If I were a teenage girl, I'd have a crush on Alden Ehrenreich or at least on his character, Ethan Wate.<br /><br />I suppose the previous reviewer has a point that there are a lot of cliches in the movie:  new odd girl with a secret comes to town, gets picked on by most of the popular kids, but cute boy likes her.  Yeah, we've all seen that story many times, but it doesn't mean it's boring.  You also have the added elements of magic, good vs. evil and generational curses (all of which could be cliches themselves).  The writers took those familiar themes and wove them together with witty dialogue to make what I thought was a very entertaining movie.  Next to the acting, my favorite part was the writing.  I laughed a lot during the movie, which I didn't really expect going in.<br /><br />I'm the wrong generation and hadn't read the book but I still really enjoyed the movie.  As much as I enjoyed it, I can only imagine how much more someone in the right age demographic or a fan of the book would love it.<br /><br />I have just two cautions.  First, the \\"Christian\\" characters do not come off well in this movie, other than perhaps the minister.  I don't personally like when characters that are supposed to represent my faith are portrayed as nasty so that was a little tough for me.  The second thing will be obvious to anyone who read the book or even watched the previews, but there is magic, some of it dark magic and the Casters could be considered witches.  I know some people have issues with that so be warned and skip this movie if you do.  Otherwise, go see this movie.<br /><br />Also, for the parents who are concerned about sex and violence in the movies their teens see:  Ethan and Lena do a lot of kissing but there isn't any sex.  Link also has a make-out session but again no sex.  There is some violence, especially during the Civil War battle flashbacks and in a few other scenes crucial to the plot (that I won't spoil for those who haven't read the book).  I would not consider this to have gratuitous violence but younger kids might get scared so I would keep this to older tweens and above.<br /><br />Update:  Now that the movie is open, there is more information available about how the movie differs from the book.  In addition to combining the characters of Amma and Marian, Ethan's Dad never appears in the movie, and one of the biggest shock scenes for me in the movie happened a completely different way in the book (notgoing into details because I don't like spoilers).  Also, the curse and breaking the curse are changed some from the book. It's a lot of book to fit into a 2 hour movie so don't be too hard on the writers & director.  Enjoy the movie for what it is and enjoy the book for what it is.going into details because I don't like spoilers).  Also, the curse and breaking the curse are changed some from the book. It's a lot of book to fit into a 2 hour movie so don't be too hard on the writers & director.  Enjoy the movie for what it is and enjoy the book for what it is.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game is fun, but the graphics look like a stretched version of the phone app. It could have looked much better.
B007EECSFA|4.0|interesting book, kept my interest and was from an interesting time in history..........setting for the book fluctuated between London, Coventry and the beach...........story tells of a time where there were many secrets in families and it reminds us that sometimes we don't even know who our family is..................highly recommend........holds your attention, enough action......and drama............
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I only saw a few of the shows on HBO and knew I had to read the books.  Read book one in a flash and I am on book three.  The writing flows from character chapter to character chapter.  I can't wait to read what everyone is doing.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I always enjoy the Lee Child novels and this one is no exception. Jack Reacher is da man!! Great reading as usual.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This series is one of my favorites. It is one of the most controversial series that is on TV in the last 10 years.
B000SEGQNS|5.0|The book only took about 3 hours to read, however, there was a lot of good information. I liked the conversational style of writing, and found that the book did a great job of hitting the major points of usability/UX Design. No real earth shattering concepts for those who are current professionals in the User Centered Design field, but could be very helpful for those who are not. Long story short, this book is worth your time, and it is also a good book for a short trip.
B00003CXCQ|1.0|Just wanted to caution purchasers. We purchased this move and received it this week. We went to have a movie party with our child last night and the move kept freezing in the middle. Also, screen became pixated and unclear (defective movie).  May want to consider ordering from another seller.
B00006I53S|5.0|The best lens I have ever owned. I am a breeder of Dalmatian dogs and this lens is great to take pictures of the puppies in their little fenced in area. Very sharp and fast with puppies that are constantly on the move.<br />Now I just need a similar lens to take those shots when the puppies are old enough to run further. If anybody can give me advise on one of those I would be delighted.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this story!!! So artfully told, and well arranged story line.  I fell deeply into the story and held on tight during every twist and turn.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has so many new features like zip lines new obstacles better graphics! I would definitely recommend this game to someone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it.  It keeps my mind occupied at lunchtime.  My grandson loves it too.  Look forward to more like this.  GOOD job!
0882847953|5.0|I got this for a drum studio class that am taking Arizona State University and so far my reading has been challenged. I personally would recommend this book if you plan to get into big band chart reading and sight reading. There are very helpful written charts that are most commonly seen in big band music and excellent exercises that you can use for left hand comping in swing music. Its a hard book to learn but this is going to jump your reading big time. Take your time with book, don't rush through it. There are simple steps to take when approaching this book. So have fun and keep swinging. :)
B001NHNG64|5.0|I feel that Lee Child has a great character in Jack Reacher and like someone in the book quoted I'd hate to be on the wrong side of Jack.  Good reading.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Very nice and addicting. No problems yet. Is there  away to turn off the music? It is very soothing, keep up the good work.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This book keep your interest the whole time.  I would recommend this book to all my family and friends who are interested in reading this type of thriller.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was a really fun game but it is pretty much the EXACT same thing as temple run. Didn't like in the missions if u do not sign on with FB it will not let you go much further in the missions!! But other that I really enjoyed it
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is one of those books that you don't want to put down the futher you get into it.  Mr. Baldacci did an excellent job with this one.
B001IF277K|5.0|Geat battery, it seems to hold the charge longer and charge faster wich is great when owning a Sony Ericcson!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|True to the series with alot of surprising things happen through the events.  Hope the new series coming to TV will be equally exciting.
0061730335|5.0|The book came in as described. It looks brand new, and the quality of handling was good as well. I would recommend this any time, any day!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|works great for school alarm and if it plugged in it stays on like a real clock cool  and yet dum because you can just by a real clock
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show, and I'm so glad it's available on Instant Video. I've recently gotten several of my friends hooked on it as well. It is well worth the money.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|A lot of fun and very addictive. Also a very original and new type of game. Very satisfied with this one!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If you don't have the first two sesions get them also. If you are already following this story well your are hooked already.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great ending to the series. It left me wanting more. I hope that we can see more of what evolves in the Grays relationship. Excellent book very enjoyable reading.
B001TODO54|2.0|My first mistake in reading this book was believing that in some way, it would be comparable to The Song of Ice and Fire by GRRM. I downloaded Graceling because I came across a list that recommended reads similar to SoIaF. When I read the reviews, I expected to be blown away. Perhaps my expectations were simply unreasonable, but I cannot, for the life of me, understand how this book has been rated so highly. The only explanation I can think of is that the vast majority of these reviews were written by young teens, because I cannot imagine how any adult could give this book 5 stars.<br /><br />The beginning of the story is interesting enough. I was intrigued by the \\"graces\\", but halfway through the book realized that nothing about graces was actually going to be explained. That was disappointing because, to me, the \\"magic\\" and mystery of graces were the most alluring aspects of the story.<br /><br />Graceling was written well enough, as long as you haven't read any masterpieces like SoIaF. This book was poorly written in comparison (weak imagery, \\"stunted\\" characters, unbelievable/easy plot fixes, terribly boring climax) and was only SLIGHTLY better than Twilight.<br /><br />As has been mentioned in some other reviews, the downfall of Graceling was the fact that the author changed the lead characters' graces 3/4 of the way through the book just to suit her plot. The change was unbelievable (and for lack of a better term - stupid). When the author did this, the story almost turned into Twilight. I hated every aspect of Twilight which is probably why Graceling left such a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />The heroine is never wrong, never challenged, and there is never any suspense or doubt that she will complete her mission. Everything falls into place and all is right with the world of Katsa. It's all just too easy. I don't know how many times I stopped reading and rolled my eyes in disappointment and exasperation.<br /><br />Additionally, the first half of the storywas far better than the second. That is a problem. The \\"climax\\" of the story is so terribly boring and predictable that the reader laments the passage of earlier parts of the novel. Add to this the fact that many loose ends were left untied (for instance, we hear next to nothing about Grandfather Tealiff after his rescue, even though his rescue seemed as though it would become a big part of the story).<br /><br />Overall, if you are teen who enjoyed Twilight, you will love this book. However, if you are a young adult or someone who appreciates masterful writing and plotting, you will be sorely disappointed with Graceling. Challenge yourself by reading a real fantasy novel in which characters evolve and develop. Graceling fails to deliver on both accounts and instead presents characters whose defining attributes change in order to fit the predetermined outcome. The story never really kicks into gear and the author only skims the surface of the most intriguing attributes of her characters. The result is a boring, shallow read that lacks credibility and relatable heroes/heroines.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a game for your free time. Its also a challenge between your friends. This game is fun (:
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Quality acting (4 of my favorites,) great hero characters, great alien bad guys, good storyline.  AWESOME alien ship.  There was probably a moral to the story about good guys overcoming all obstacles but if I'm glued to the movie like I was to this one, it makes it a 5 star movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really like game. The graphics and story line are really good and the gaming is diverse enough to keep you hooked on it for hours.  I like all of G5's games but this one takes the cake!
B009OYSFDM|2.0|Writing is not very good, story line is sketchy, acting i pretty weak. They are all very good looking though.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Some people will either love or hate this game.  I must not be cerebral enough for it, found it to be annoying and frustrating.  Got bored with it rather quick.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever including the game play as Steve and  having extra inventory. But they could add flint and steal to the inventory along with the end portal
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a great read.  It is the second book in a trilogy that follows families through generations of history.  Book one, Fall of Giants, takes you into and through World War I and Book two begins as Hitler is taking power in Germany.  As you follow these families through the war from differing perspectives (from Russia, from the US, from Germany and England) you feel as if you get a vivid picture of what living through that major, horrific historical event was like.  Though over 900 pages, you really cannot put this down.  Follett's writing,  historical research and characters are exemplary. When I wasn't reading the book, I was thinking about it or dreaming about it.  I highly recommend this series and cannot wait for Book 3!
1451695195|2.0|I was disappointed by his often very clinical description of his trip to Heaven. It was very unsettling. He seemed to focus more on the gruesome part of the journey (being underground as he called it) than the enlightened part. I quickly gave the book away as soon as I read it.....didn't want the &#34;vibe&#34; around.
B003L16FAE|1.0|I bought this movie as a part of - 3 disc (Own the Moments) Arnold movies - Commando, Predator and Terminator. I was glad to see - I got Predator - UHE in this pack! But all that joy was lost to find disc is - unreadable on any of my three different bluray players - ps3, Samasung and PC/Laptop!! I returned to store - Walmart and exchanged for another pack. SAME RESULT!!! It seems they have messed up the whole lot of these movies produced lately! What a shame!! In my case, Walmart even refused to exchange 2nd time! What a rip off!! DO NOT BUY THIS TITLE now! You may get a defective disc like another buyer has already posted!! Be Aware.

030758836X|1.0|I borrowed this book from the library, and I am glad I did: I found the first two chapters tedious and boring. I didn't know, like or care about anyone I had met. I put down the book and discovered I had no lingering questions, no interesting in the characters introduced so far, no desire to see what happened next.<br /><br />I have been told that once I got a little further, I'd want to continue. I'm not compelled to find out.<br /><br />Plus, I've been told it's a \\"throw it across the room when you're finished\\" book, and I don't need another one of those in my life.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|BEWARE COUNTERFEIT CASE. Confirmed this case is COUNTERFEIT with LIFEPROOF.<br /><br />I had a audio distortion issue and called LIFEPROOF for a replacement. They confirmed this case is fraudulent and counterfeit and the seller is not authorized. I am reporting this matter to AMAZON for an immediate refund.
B004H51706|5.0|I purchased the Bruder Land Rover for my 4 yr-old grandson's birthday.  He loves it, and has already hauled several of his action figures in the driver's seat and the back of the wagon.  Bruder toys are sturdy and able to withstand the abuse from imaginative play.

0765325950|5.0|This will not be one of my usual reviews.  After all, A Memory of Light is the fourteenth and final volume of the Wheel of Time series, Robert Jordan's fantasy epic, completed after his death by Brandon Sanderson in 2013, following two other Sanderson-completed volumes.  If you've read the first thirteen books, especially after Sanderson took over for Jordan, let's face it - you're going to read A Memory of Light whatever I have to say about it.  If you stopped partway through the series, or haven't ever started it, it's difficult to make a recommendation about investing your time to read over four million words.  I've been following the series for over two decades, so it's hard for me to be particularly objective.  All that said...<br /><br />A Memory of Light is a great conclusion to a series that has had its highs and lows.  It's not perfect, and I honestly don't think you could have a \\"perfect\\" ending for a series that's been going on for 23 years and thirteen previous volumes, and outlasted the original author.  There are just too many things still going on in the world to cover everything everyone wants to see, even in 912 pages.  Sanderson does an admirable job bringing the series to an ending, though, and I have a hard time seeing anything that Jordan himself could have done much better.<br /><br />Now, on to some specifics, while trying to be as un-spoiler-y as possible...<br /><br />The big three ta'veren of Rand, Mat, and Perrin are all great in this book.  Each of them is very interesting, enjoyable, and important to the conclusion in their own way (says the reader who remembers Rand spending whole books barely appearing, Mat - one of my favorites - spending a book buried under a wall and Perrin - then not a favorite - spending four books chasing after his even-less-favorite-at-the-time kidnapped wife).  Rand, of course, faces down the Dark One in the main metaphsyical event of Tarmon Gai'don.  Mat is faced with having to out epic general the most epic general of the Forsaken commanding the Light's armies.  Perrin handles the Tel'aran'rhiod front for the Light for some exciting reality bending adventures.<br /><br />Lan, Egwene, and Elayne are also very strong in A Memory of Light.  Lan seems to glide from one crowning moment of awesome to another.  Egwene is fantastic as Amyrlin in the confrontation the Aes Sedai have always been preparing for, with a great character growth and her own epic moment.  Elayne is masterful both in command and in combat.<br /><br />Relative newcomers to the series Androl the Asha'man and Pevara of the Red Ajah are great.  Both are very interesting, and provide good ways to explore parts of the story that the long time main characters are too busy to handle.  Logain also impressed me with his arc.  Tuon is fascinating as always.<br /><br />Demandred finally appears on the scene, and he's a force to be reckoned with.  For the most part, watching him give the forces of the Light a good thrashing is great, as he truly lives up to the reputation the Forsaken have had for thousands of years.  The downside is he makes most of the other Forsaken look even more incompetent than they already did by contrast.  It makes me wish all the Forsaken had been this much bad news.  Lanfear, at least, still has it together in this book and provides her usual threat to the heroes.<br /><br />Some patches are still a bit rough.  Min's more useful in this book than in most, but still somewhat superfluous, as is Aviendha in my eyes.  Nynaeve and Moiraine don't have nearly enough to do, especially after all the build-up of bringing Moiraine back.  Moridin, despite getting a look at his motivations, is fairly flat and less of a threat than he feels like he should be at this point, especially with Demandred tearing things up elsewhere in contrast.  And Padan Fain seems tossed in as an afterthought.<br /><br />Overall, though, it's a strong ending to the series.  The major plot threads are all addressed.  Some ofthe minor plot threads are still loose, but that helps give the impression that the Wheel is still turning.  Most of the characters get a worthy payoff to their personal stories.<br /><br />If you've stuck with the series this long, especially after Sanderson took the helm, I think you'll be pleased with A Memory of Light.  Sanderson - who cites the Wheel of Time as a major reason he became a writer - did an excellent job finishing out the series for his fellow fans.  He definitely has my gratitude for taking on this monumental task, and I'm happy he did so, as I was not previously familiar with him before he was chosen to finish the Wheel of Time, and he's become a favorite author of mine in his own right after reading his original books.<br /><br />It's strange having a series that's been part of my life for so long be complete.  I'm glad to have had the chance to read the conclusion, though, and look forward to pondering and discussing with fellow fans what the Fourth Age might bring.  I also look forward to the Wheel of Time encyclopedia being planned for next year.  Though the main narrative is over, I still have one last book to anticipate.the minor plot threads are still loose, but that helps give the impression that the Wheel is still turning.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am loving this game! For people worried about the Facebook - you don't HAVE to connect to it. However, on Android, that's how they save your game progress. So if you lose the game, or move to another device, etc. without being linked to Facebook, you'll lose your progress. Linking to FB means you just log in there and your park will be back again as you left it. It's a bit annoying, but I haven't noticed that it posts anything to my wall, or does anything except give me my list of friends who also play and back up the game.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Jack Reacher manages once again to stumble upon the evil that men do. Another action packed, suspenseful read that you won't want to put down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I normally get bored playing temple run and move on but this is is so awesome that every minute I keep keep on playing. I love this game so much. I am very picky when it comes to games and for right now,  this is the number one game I love.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I have read most of David Baldacci `s books and enjoyed them.  They are exciting, interesting as well as informative.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I am a Beatles fan and have collected quite a few LPs and CDs of them through the years. Since I purchased this, I have played it almost everyday and I never get tired listening to it. Sonically, it's the best Beatles album I've heard. I really love the way George Martin and his son Giles arranged and mixed this album. You really don't have to see the Las Vegas show &#34;Love&#34; in order to appreciate the music. It certainly deserves a solid five star rating!
B003Z39G0O|5.0|I REALLY BOUGHT THIS FOR ONE SPECIFIC SONG, BUT THE MORE I LISTEN TO IT THE MORE I LIKE IT.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I thought it was excellent as usual by Grisham.  A little slow in spots, but what book isn't.  The underdog comes through in the end.
B001W2JWWC|5.0|I have always loved this group.  And, when Bud used it in the commercial it truly touched my heart.  Growing up in farmland where I rode horses; I know how difficult it can be to give up something you have nurtured from birth, though sickness, and sold it off to another.  But, when you treat your animal well it always remembers you.no matter how far it goes.  My dad gave away one of my cats and three days later, through 5 miles of unknown woods; it appeared at our back door.  Hungry; but happy. There is more feeling in &#34;Landslide&#34; than originally depicted.  And, this album is a great mix of the new and old.

B0058DRSHW|5.0|Excellent to understand the dynamic of building and, which is more, sustaining an organization.

B00AZ3KPZC|4.0|Peter Pan is perfect just like I remembered it and my 4 year old loves it! Unfortunately, the streaming quality of Amazon's Instant video is poor.

B000002P2V|4.0|For Who purists, this won't be high on your list of ranked Who albums.  However, out of the context of their catalogue, it is a fine late 70s-era album.  Although this album is a departure from the more rock mainstream Who sound, it is a compelling listen.  Some would argue that Pete Townshend's song writing and musical stylings on this album are sub-par.  I would put it more perpective and say that it was out of flux.  Look at all early 60s bands approaching middle age as the world approached the 1980s.  What songwriters weren't changing their styles and experimenting with different sounds at this time as they not only grappled with their age, but also the changing music scene.  In a post-punk world, a new group of musicians were rising up.  The \\"old\\" bands were no longer guaranteed a position at the top of the pile anymore and they were also eager to try some new things musically as they matured.  I think if people keep this in mind when listening to this album, it would give them more perspective and appreciate it more.<br /><br />This album should also be remembered more as a historical document that what it is at face value. It certainly is a departure from the rest of their catalogue, no doubt about that. It's more interesting to me that three of the four members of the band were staring severe drug abuse problems square in the face. As we know in Keith Moon's instance, it results in his death. Let's not forget that Pete Townshend was in a crossroads as well and quite literally 'standing on the ledge' if you recall his near death/suicide episode in a hotel room window. Pete makes it a point to reference this phrase not once, but twice in \\"Love is Coming Down\\" and similarly in the orignal demo lyrics to \\"Empty Glass\\" on the bonus track.<br /><br />\\"Love is Coming Down\\" is important as it is a representative microcosm of the impending fracturing of the band. In fact, I will go so far to say that not only that, but \\"Love is Coming Down\\" is quite possibly the greatest example of autobiographical songwriting ever. Outside of this context, it is still a huge emotional powerhouse of a song.<br /><br />Listen to this album with an open mind and you will find it compelling.

B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|Black Veil Brides certainly have not been wasting any time making an impression or they name known. The band helped bring back the idea of theatrical bands with a visual image and they've been working at a fast pace releasing albums and touring in a quick succession. BVB are receiving a lot of love and hate but they've been making their name known regardless and moving up the ladder. After debut We Stitch These Wounds (2010) and follow up Set The World On Fire (2011) the Brides have returned with this time a concept album.  I think a concept album is certainly a bold step for the young ambitious band, instead of delivering another 12 rock songs they went in a different direction and added elements of storytelling and orchestration that make for a grandiose project. Today's bands aren't exactly doing concept albums that much anymore and to the younger audiences a concept album may seem like a farfetched idea and you run the risk of alienating your fan base. I for one, am happy about the band not playing it safe and it makes me respect them that much more. Suffice to say, it isn't exactly a straightforward Rock effort like the first two but I think it gives the band a larger musical scope and it adds dimension to the music proving concept records can actually work (Pink Floyd's The Wall, Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime, The Who's Tommy and the list goes on...). I applaud them both for daring to attempt this and for the collect of songs they have given us in Wretched and the Devine: The Story of the Wild Ones.<br /><br />The album starts with the introduction of ''Exordium'' but truly begins with ''Bulletproof'' a fast, hard driven song with a hearty and fierce chorus that sounds like a blend of the band's last album, very effective. ''New Years Day'' to me is not quite a let down but it just doesn't really do anything for me. ''Wretched and the Divine'' the title track is more adventurous but fails to excite me. Thing pick up from here. \\"Devils Choir\\" is one of the highlights of Wretched and Divine for me because it introduces orchestral instrumentation which makes the song go in an unanticipated direction that works surprisingly well, yet still rocks. Major thumbs up on this one. ''We Don't Belong'' is one of my most played songs so far; it's uplifting, infectious, strong and ridiculously catchy. It almost instantly makes you feel better. It has that Industrial Metal type of introduction before kicking into high gears, definitely one to watch for. \\"Resurrect The Sun\\" is another excellent track and I rank this among the catchiest on the album and of the BVB catalog to date, I could see this as one of the potential singles and it is one I keep going back  to.  ''Overture'' is the lengthiest instrumental or non spoken track. The violin is beautiful and haunting and it replicates ''Resurrect The Sun'' while giving an entirely different feel and not being repetitive, this one works to full effect. ''Days Are Numbered'' is a noticeable track and has some great verses.  ''Lost It All'' is one of the album's obligatory ballads. I enjoyed the band's previous ballads and this one is no exception (although I prefer ''The Mortician's Daughter'' and ''Saviour'' still). It may be a ballad but it's one of the most powerful songs on the album. I like the violins and the woman's voice towards the end they really bring the song in another dimension. ''Done For You'' is another ballad, more personal this time and works very well except that it's a little too short for me to be really effective. The single \\"In The End\\" is fantastic and extremely catchy with a chorus straight out of the 80s Glam bands, a real fist-pumper and crowd pleaser it sticks in your head, rocks, and has a hard driving beat.<br /><br />Then there are brief spoken and instrumentally driven tracks who tell part of the story and helps set up the songs. Some of them are very short and don't add a whole lot or cannot really be considered what most of us would call songs but overall Wretched and Divine works with this. \\"Overture\\" particularly shows flashes of brilliance with Jinx playing the violin. (classically trained as it turn out). Some may be taken aback a bit by some of the orchestration found on this record. \\"Violins and orchestration on a BVB album?\\" , I say why not? I doubt that even if fans don't enjoy certain of these, they can't overlook them and enjoy the rest of the album. Personally I think the \\"F.E.A.R Transmission\\" tracks add a certain mood and create and atmosphere that enhances the listening experience as a whole. I think what the album is missing is a great ballad. We Stitch These Wounds had ''The Mortician's Daughter'' and ''Carolyn'', Set The World On Fire had ''Saviour''. I just don't think that ''Lost It All'' is quite on par with those .but that's just my opinion I could very well see other loving this one.<br /><br />I won't delve into the story behind the album as some have already done that, but I have noticed that there definitely seems to be a religious theme throughout. The concept of the album is basically what the band has always been about: standing up for yourself, facing your bullies, not giving up and finding inner strength. Except this time it's wrapped around a story. Also the band's sound has become slightly more commercial with time and each album, they go for the big choruses and singles and there is nothing wrong with that. as long as the music continues to be this good<br /><br />What could have been a left turn for the band went very right. I still have a special attachment to the Brides' first album but Wretched and Divine is amazing, has terrific songs, a concept that actually works and it all ties in together nicely I'd say if it isn't their best it's a great effort. Some of their fans might have preferred a more straightforward release but I think this was the band's chance to do something really special and perhaps even gain more credibility. In the few weeks I've owned and listened to it I ended up enjoying the album immensely so therefore I will give it a high rating, not full marks but darn near close 4.5 out of 5. I was really impressed and surprised.all Wretched and Divine works with this. \\"Overture\\" particularly shows flashes of brilliance with Jinx playing the violin.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This has got to be the best laid out kindle fire calculator ever. I use it in my accounting class and the grid or &quot;buttons&quot; are so large, I can use it out of my peripheral vision.
B009WJ44KC|4.0|This is John Williams at his very best. Aaron Copland would be proud. And America should be proud as well.
B00632HWOG|3.0|The new format is a disappointment. Click doesn't work correctly, lingers or not at all. Go back to old format. It's easier to read and worked!
0808514571|5.0|hardcover great book to read, recommend to anyone of any age to read this book. This is a great price.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have seen almost all the James Bond 007 movies and this, by far, has the potential to be the best of them all. Great performance by all the actors, especially the evil guy and M. James Bond is a true killer in this movie, not just a lover or a gambler. Loved it. 5/5

B005TZFYNE|5.0|love it . the perfect gift for my sister; the cd was inside the wrap plastic; it was brand new. I will defenetly buy again. the cd sound is perfect
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|The game pad is exactly what I thought it would be.  The controls are small, but usable.  Button mapping is not great, but will hopefully be fixed one day when the playground app is out of Beta.  As other reviews have mentioned the left stick and direction pad are always mapped the same, and the left 2 and right 2 are not recognized by any emulators.  Works great with Shadow Gun, did not work with anything from Gameloft (that I have).<br />Full disclosure, I did not, and will not download the playground app until it is out of beta...based on the reviews about that app.<br />Hope this helps.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an exciting ending and quite a surprise.<br />the author keep in it all the way.  I highly recommend it.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I think the authors had the idea for a good book- young love, good and evil, well developed characters and a story that weaves seamlessly connecting events of the past to present day happenings and choices. However I felt the plot dragged at times. Overall though, I still would highly recommend this book. You will probably enjoy it especially if you were a twilight lover.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed reading the second book to follow up on the first one.<br />I loved the suspense as it builds toward the third one.
B009439HEY|5.0|excelente ,GENESIS REMOSADO CON UN ACTUALIZADO  SONIDO<br />REALMENTE HACKETT LO SUPO HACER ,MUSICOS DE PRIMERA LINEA ,ALTAMENTE RECOMENDADO<br />PARA LOS FANATICOS DE GENESIS
B005K17RU0|5.0|Those is perfection in every way. What else can a person expect coming from Accuweafher.Everything you need in an app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I bought the first app on Amazon and then I loved it so much that I had to have the second Temple Run. I think that it has much better graphics and I love the diamonds you can get so that if your trying to beat your high score you can save yourself with them. I love this app and would reccomend this app to anyone who loved the first.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was such a surprising great find! I ended up reading all three of her books in a week and they were so good I almost want to read them again this week!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I was going to denver with my friend hope and she had this app on her kindle fire and she let me try this one of a kind app. At first i had no idea what i was doing and then i got the hang of the game. When i was back with my kindle fire i bought it and instamtly was addicted to it. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes adventure. And if you think that you love this app, just wait till you try Temple Run 2
B008602KQI|5.0|I didn't think I would like this but couldn't put it down.  Our whole family loves this very much.  Great!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Sheldon Cooper is adorable and funny at the same time! Start with buying the first season and follow up with this one. It's great! This is a fantastic show....lots of college humour and lots of brainy stuff thrown in for good measure. I love the big bang theory!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to pass time or wind down before bed.  I normally play solitaire most nights just before I fall asleep. This game works perfectly!
B004X60QE2|5.0|This show is one of the very best I've ever seen. When an ordinary, average guy (Colin Ferguson) comes across a small town filled to the brim with highly intelligent people and some very colourful characters all sorts of things start to happen, time travel, teleportation, and all sorts of new &#34;inventions&#34; that go awry. This show combines the elements of science fiction with suspenseful moments at times and really pulls it together well. Buy this, pop some popcorn, and call it a Saturday thing, you won't regret it.
184448551X|1.0|The only thing this book does is talk about how great the author is and the school that she went to.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|This movie has a very sad storyline but it is necessary for the plot and folds into it well. It's not fit for the little ones as it has some very gory, graphic, and scary scenes so make sure you put your babies to bed before watching this. It has all the right elements for being a cult classic and has really good acting. It's good to have for the library collection of best horror movies ever as it will scare the you know what out of you in a couple of places. The ending is bittersweet and sorta sad but I'm not going to spoil it for you. I'd recommend watching this movie if you like to blend the weird with the macabre. Alice Krige gives a spectacular performance!
B007R41E8O|3.0|Back and forth and back and forth over and over to use one item. That's a huge part of the game. Didn't mind the hidden object scenes but you repeat the same ones way too much. The graphics and story were creepy cool but I hate having to hit the hint button to figure out what the next move is but this game left me no choice. Just average game altogether.
B0059XTU1S|5.0|I saw the movie in 3D on Christmas Day.  It is the first 3D movie I ever thought was worth watching.  I can't wait till the next part comes out this year and next year too. I also bought and read the The Hobbit: 75th Anniversary Edition [Kindle Edition With Audio/Video] here on Amazon.  Amazing! I cannot count how many times I watched all of The Lord of The Rings movies, which really follow The Hobbit.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This is an amazing app.  My Kindle Fire HD can now be a desktop computer with all the files at my disposal.  It was quick and easy to install both on my PC and tablet.  Also it is easy to use.  Since many applications on my Kindle Fire HD can be shared, I can email them to myself and print them remotely.  The other thing I REALLY like is that I can now watch WMV (windows media video) files on my Kindle; and since I have a micro HDMI cable, I can also connect my Kindle to my TV and watch videos on a large screen.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game to pass time very additive. there could be more activities and less cool downs. entertains siblings for hours.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I started watching this series at the end of season 1, but was able to catch up during the break w/reruns. I love this show! I'm kinda bummed that I had to pay for this episode, but as with the other ones, it was pretty good. Please, please find a way for prime members to be able to watch TV shows for a lesser price. Then it would be a perfect end!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Love this book it really helps you let him or her know your love language and it also helps with a lot of questions you may have about your relationship
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|My new favorite show and my new favorite CD. I cannot wait for their 2nd CD. Some of the best country music out today
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Love the story but he gets very detailed about everything .I'm sure that reflects when the book was written. Loved all the history.
B00422LESO|4.0|While not plumbing the psychological depths of Jane Austen`s England, Austenland was the perfect escape for the hope(full) romantic that is so easily hidden from us in our daily lives. Upbeat, lively, and just cynical enough, Hale creates a fantasy where finding our Jane Austen happy ending is still real.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a former nurse I was really intrigued be this book. We always knew patients were still there when they were in comas and now we know what they were doing. I believe!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|it works.  would like it to sync with Verizon phone and kindle but don't know how to do that.  If you have suggestions, I would welcome them.
B001HN6922|5.0|I baught it for my nephew. Great birthday gift. He loved it, even though he had already seen it a million times.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything about Downton Abbey is Outstanding - everything is 5 Star - the Writing, wardrobe, locations, acting, directing - all combine to make this the Finest TV Series that I have ever seen.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My nephew went bonkers when they stopped playing this movie on netflix, he still watches it every day since we got it.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I'm a life long RUSH fan and Clockwork Angels continues to show that their music matures and evolves with me.  It's a fantastic listen.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I just love the movie, what can I say? It teaches a lot about morals while still being fun and updated.
0375869026|4.0|I read this book after an intellectual book podcast I listen to recommended it at the best children's book of 2012. I don't read that many children's books to comment on that, but this book can easily have broad appeal to all age groups, even adults, so that is saying something.<br /><br />I don't write plot summaries in my reviews unless there is a point to make about the plot. This novel is much more character based. The points of view of about 8 different people in the main character August's life are presented and this never gets messy. One character's section is written without any capitals to help distinguish his character as a young man trying to establish his identity. I don't like this kind of style but the section is short. August is a character that you almost wish existed so you could throw your arms around him and hug him. It's so refreshing to see a child who has tons of problems to face but faces them with the tremendous love and respect of his highly functional (!) family. They aren't perfect but this is a together family of the type that I think many people don't believe really exists today. (They do!). I almost hope the author will write a sequel about August dealing with the teenage years.<br /><br />The central message of the book is an important one to bring out in these days: that it is important to be kind to all and that if you are kind, the kindness will eventually pay off even if it exacts a price in the present. IT's a good lesson for kids to learn and for adults to be reminded of.<br /><br />The age recommendation on Amazon is 8-12 and while I don't see any content reasons why it would not be appropriate, the age range seems a little young as I would say the book is a little more sophisticated than that. August is 10 and in fifth grade but comes off as older than that. A mature eight year old with excellent reading skills, maybe but not all.<br /><br />The ending is a little too convenient and that is the reason for the four stars insteadof five.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is such a good movie! You can't help but to love a rat who likes to cook, the irony is just awesome.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I couldn't find my printer in the list under the HP, I have a Officejet 6500A Plus,which is wireless also, but didn't work out to well so I will keep looking until I find the one that works with mine
B000VBIGD6|5.0|will go down forever as a great funny Christmas movie after the Christmas story with 'you'll shoot your eye out'.
0062238868|1.0|This is a negative review.  I feel genuinely bad writing it so close to Mr. Kyle's death but I finished the book not 2 days before those tragic events.  I do not speak negatively of Mr. Kyle.  He is a true American hero in every sense of the word.  His contributions to this country both in and out of the Navy are deserving of the highest praise.  This book, however, did not meet my expectations (subjective) and is poorly written (objective.)<br /> Allow  me to address my subjective criticism first by prefacing that I spent 2006 fighting in Ramadi and had worked with the \\"sister platoon\\" he mentioned on several occasions in the eastern part of the city.  Given that this book has the subtitle: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History.  I expected a good bit of coverage of his wartime experience.  Instead, I got short quips, no details, and a good bit of complaining.  As someone who was there, I would have appreciated more tactical details.  What training was most useful and what could be discarded?  How were your hide spots chosen?  What was going on around your locations?  What gear did you use/prefer?  As a regular line infantryman, I was fairly limited in what I could do and where I could go.  I would have appreciated those viewpoints from someone in the SEALS who had considerably more freedom and discretion.  Paint me a picture of what's occurring.  Too many of the wartime experiences are little more than \\"we went into a building, watched a road, shot the bad guys.\\"  Perhaps you want details of the strenuous SEAL training?  You won't find it here.<br />Readers should be advised that this is more of an autobiography than anything.  You'll be ¼ of the way through before he even joins the military.  I couldn't care less about his bronco-busting days or how his wife fell for him because he was \\"hard and muscular and sensitive.\\"  The frequent interruptions in his story for his wife's point of view were annoying and unwelcomed.<br />Mr. Kyle's writing does not do justice to the SEALS.  Rather than coming away thinking of this elite unit as the quiet professions they are supposed to be, I came away regarding them as a bunch of rowdy frat-boys who do nothing but get drunk and fight in bars.  Perhaps I'm a bit spoiled by the work of genius that is \\"Inside Delta Force\\" by Eric Haney.  I was hoping for more of that sort of writing excellence but I was severely disappointed.<br />My subjective criticisms may not matter to you.  Perhaps you would like this autobiography if you do not have my high expectations; but hear my objective criticism first.  Mr. Kyle is no author.  His writing has all the depth of a 10th grade book report.  I had no expectations of Shakespearian prose from an enlisted military man (I'm not saying it couldn't happen, just that I did not expect it.)  When I saw 3 names on the book:  Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen, Jim DeFelice, I assumed one of them would be able to write a decent paragraph.  It's not abhorrent English; it's just shallow and sloppy.  For example, it would have been nice to see a descriptive adjective other than \\"bad-ass\\" over and over again.  Clearly this book was a gimmick, thrown together simply to cash in on Mr. Kyle's \\"most prolific sniper\\" title while the country is hungry for all things SEAL.  If Mr. Kyle's family continues to make money off it, I have no problem with a little capitalism.  I only feel the need to dispute all the glowing reviews of this book by people who wouldn't know a well-written book if it hit them center-mass.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|great insight to a place most of us will not come back to tell others about IF U R IN DOUBT READ IT IF YOU BELIEVE IT WILL REINFORCE YOUR BELIEFS
B0061S0A64|4.0|Cute little app. FUn to lay down a quick beat with. Though it wont make you David Guetta, it is fun putting together different combination and seeing what kid of track you can lay down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book. I never put it down. I will be reading it again before the movie comes out later this year. The Kindle made it easy to read any time of day
B006XIR9KM|1.0|Not that great of a game. Pretty laggy and developer could have done better. Garbage that wouldnt even be thought of in the iTunes app store.
B004QX07G4|5.0|If you enjoy Ellen's humor you will LOVE this book. It has motivation and advice mingled with her witty humor. A very fun read.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Om Nom is back and better than ever. Very inventive and new ways of getting his candy, or cupcake to him. Rockets, suction cups, and snails even! Never get tired of these games and they are constantly updated with new levels. Can't wait to see what the dev will think of next in the series!

B006ZZC3D6|3.0|Pretty simple game. Toss the little chuzzle lookin fur balls around the screen and leave only one. It is pretty fun at first but gets old relatively quickly.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This year my teacher had us read the first Percy Jackson book and before my my class was even finished finished with the first book I was three books into the series
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Pretty fun game, although after a while there are only so many ways you can lay down a vine from point a to point b. Good time waster but not enough to be addicted to it. Average game, yet well thought out.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|It's good for time but as an alarm it sucks if you put it on for all week it'll do it like one day then refuse it
B007BZM30M|4.0|Reminds me of Britney back in the day the first time I heard her. Great pop song. Very catchy. Great little video as well. Gets stuck in your head very easily.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|So fun, I can't stop playing it! It's not glichy for kindle fire hd !!! Trust me, this game is a must get!!!!!!!! All the way!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The levels can be a little repeatitive, but it is a great way to past time and solve puzzles at the same time.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Too many pop ups in trying to play the game!!! Very frustrating when trying to play then have to deal with the pop ups.
B007704HO6|4.0|Enchanting read, which charts the journey of James who had been living on the streets of London, scratching a hand-to-mouth existence. That was until he meta stray ginger Tom cat, which he christened BOB. Bob's influence on James, his needing to care and look after the cat gave the writer company, a focus, encouraged him to be less selfless. It is an inspiring tale, one that shows people can have second and third chances. I recommend this book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app!!!!! can check out the weather where ever you are going or where your family lives always correct!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|when i first got this app i loved it.You can realy ride the horse!But then it took a very long time to load then my kindle fire shut off and did not turn back on for TWO DAYS!!!!! If u love ur device do not get this app!
B0089XH38M|5.0|Great app, makes be feel secure in having it and it scans etc when its supposed and you can check your device to see how will it is working.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Even though I' ve never been to Ireland, everything that has to do with it's past I'm interested.<br />A work of fiction or maybe not that much as we are seen today the reality of the orfanages there, is easy for the reader to empathize the the main characters and enjoy an afternoon of relax reading!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|makes things so easy to look up and find what you are looking for, so easy to use. would recommend it to anyone
B00846REIS|1.0|Boring, would never buy the sequel!! I don't know if this book was written after or before 50 Shades of Grey, but is in the exact same line of events, there are so many similitudes that sometimes you might think it' s a joke.<br />Gideon Cross, Christian Grey, same initials only in different positions. Eva vs Ana?? Hate it!!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Very easy to use and glad I have it on my Kindle Fire, would recommend it for use to anyone.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was my first time with Lee Child and what a good time.  Loved everything about this book.  Can hardly wait to read Number 2.
B00APN45B2|3.0|Just a word of advice. This is a new 2013 Blu-ray / DVD combo set. Even though the description from Amazon said it is rated R, the movie itself on the Blu-ray is actually rated the theatrical PG-13 version. Only the DVD contains the unrated cut of the film so if you are looking for the Unrated Version on Blu-ray, you will not find it here. When I returned the disk to Amazon, I recommended that they should update the product description to avoid other customers from being confused as I was. As always, returning the product to Amazon was a straightforward procedure and they will refund most if not all of my return shipping fee.
193609648X|5.0|Anyone who loves color and texture will love the patterns in this book!  The difficulty is in finding the yarns in the colors shown (if you especially like the colors used in the display pieces).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A great read with a the expected twists and surprises.  The end left me hoping for more, hint...hint :).  Throughly enjoyed it.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|This was a great movie. We enjoyed watching this movie. The actors really made you feel for the situation that they were involved in. This is a great movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|great series!  the characters are the best in this production.  i am a happy camper!!  this show rocks!  i cant say any more
0545265355|5.0|I love these books! When I first opened them I could not put them down! I chose to read them instead of doing other things, like sleeping or eating! Seriously. They're great.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I find it hard to believe the level of quality this re-master has! I figured it had to be better than the horrible Original Masters CD release from the nineties but I could never have I imagined that the sound would be so clear, full and articulated...this is really a quantum leap forward sonically. Well worth the ticket price!
B008EKOO46|2.0|Nowhere near the power of Diamond's other books. Insights were trite and obvious. Most of the discussion covered small bands and tribes, not much on chiefdoms. Diamond's opinions about the role of religion in human societies was rather condescending. I'm a fan of his, but I wouldn't recommend this book.
B0063GORYU|4.0|No issues playing this on my Kindle Fire.  Boring graphics,  no choices in card designs, or colors.  The fact that ads continually pop up while cards are dealt is incredibly irritating.  I would rather pay $1 or $2 and not have the constant annoyance.  Free has its price and in this case it is irritation!  Game plays well,  no glitches,  choice of difficulty levels and cumulative score tracking.  Game just needs more graphic selections and get rid of the pop-up ads!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Some Words. It is a  great App, i also use it for my Samsung S III. No Errors, one of my best Apps.
B004QOB8SO|3.0|3 Episodes.  The first, Scandal in Belgravia, is excellent, 5 stars<br />Episodes 2 and 3 paled by comparison.  There were some deaths throughout the series which were very puzzling to understand.<br />And were not ever explained, even to the barest extent.  I found that disappointing.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These wall decals were the perfect finishing touches in our Disney Princess nursery.  They applied easily.  It is amaizing how these little touches can make all the difference.

B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app.  I listen to talk radio a lot and it has all sorts of stations and people that I listen to.  It's like having free satelite radio.

1451688091|4.0|Doris Kearn Goodwin's \\"Team of Rivals\\" is a wonderful multiple biography of Lincoln and the men who served with him in Cabinet, and richly derserves all the accolades it has received since it was published.<br /><br />I'm writing this review however for the person, who like me, comes to the book after watching Spielberg's sublime film about the passage of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution, hoping that the book will shed new and greater light on many of the scenes in the film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the idea that \\"Lincoln\\" the film is even remotely based on \\"Team of Rivals\\" is perhaps one of the most dishonest, sly, and yet coldly successful marketing gimmicks of the last 100 years. With the exception, literally, of perhaps two pieces of dialog included in the film that are also included in the book, Lincoln the movie is as removed from, alien to, different than and just plain unconnected to Team of Rivals in any material or measurable way, as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is connected to the classic novel Dracula.<br /><br />Most heartbreaking of all for those coming to the book looking to expand their understanding of the machinations involved in the passage of the 13th Amendment, Team of Rivals presents a straightforward, undramatic, fairly prosaic description of the relevant events in about 2 pages. Literally none of the scenes in the film, including the wonderful cabinet scenes in which Daniel Day Lewis' masterful performance is given room to shine, the scenes between Lincoln and Mary, Lincoln and his son or Lincoln with Seward are even remotely referenced in the book, suggesting that they were probably all the artistic invention of Tony Kushner, the screen writer of the film. To connect these two works therefore is the most crass type of dishonesty I've seen in recent times. It may be one thing to say that Rivals inspired the decision to make Lincoln, or that it was used as a source for the production of the film in various ways, but to imply or suggest that Lincoln the movie is \\"based in part on Team of Rivals\\" is just plain wrong, dishonest, misleading and unnecessary.<br /><br />A final observation or two about the book itself. As with the movie, I found as soon as I completed reading the book that my immediate desire was to read more about the subject. In that regard, the book is an amazingly successful work that really and truly grips interest throughout its entire 900 or so pages. Goodwin however, is not without two glaring, in my view, weaknesses, at least. First, it's clear that she overestimates her own narrative abilities by attempting the shared biography approach. While the first chapter sets up wonderful suspense, the first third of the book is somewhat annoying for its almost curious abundunce of material about Lincoln's rivals compared with rather sparse information about Lincoln himself, which may be unavoidable due to the paucity of information which may really be available about his early life. Although never boring, the truth is that the first third of the book feels like filler before the main event, and never completely satisfies. No matter how hard she tries, Goodwin can't make the other men around Lincoln as interesting to read about, but she plods on nonetheless. Because of this, the book doesnt' really start until Lincoln's nomination, at which point it attains all the urgency of a great political thriller.<br /><br />The second problem with Goodwin is that she is obviously unable to demonstrate any distance from her subject. Although Lincoln makes some glaring mistakes and is arguably guilty of gross incompetence in the early days of his administration, Goodwin glosses over his failings and weaknesses. She also glosses over one or two events by suggesting they were mere misunderstandings when they appeared to have been nothing less than calculated treason by certain cabinet members in the first few months of the administration, and in particular Secretary of State Seward's involvement in the \\"one ship given two sets of orders\\" affair.<br /><br />These two issues aside, this is a fascinating book about a fascinating president and time in history, and is simply required reading for anyone remotely interested in the civil war, Lincoln, or the emancipation proclamation and the 13th amendment. Worth owning.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Does not allow for parallel reading option with kindle fire, maybe that could be fixed with updates, hopefully that will happen soon
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The pilot episode is still my favorite, but the second season of Suits continues to surprise me with original stories and surprising character insights. The characters are the best part, and USA doesn't disappoint with dynamic and entertaining personalities.
B00APJLX8E|3.0|Animation is well done, plot is decent, small children will love it.. Usually my wife and I enjoy animated children's movies due to the underlying adult themes present, but we both agreed this one was nothing special.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I was curious where the story would go after the first book. She managed to find somewhere interesting to take it. These books are very easy reads and entertaining.

1400049628|3.0|I didn't love this book.  It was humorous, and I'm not sure what I expected exactly, but for all the hubbub surrounding it, I was less than impressed.  It seemed to drag on at some point, especially in the history sections, although this is also where I thought it shined -- explaining historical events as zombie uprisings.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I did enjoy it. As always Kate Morton is a good read. The site is asking for more words, I think I've given enough of my time.
B004A94FE4|5.0|I have now used these pre and post-race and am happy with them.  One day I had dead legs before a race.  I slept in them that night and the next day (race day) my legs felt really fresh.  I also used them in the middle of the Goofy Challenge (look it up) and they worked well their too.  I'm 6'1&#34; and 175&#34; and the medium regular works fine.  I also bought the long version, but it was overkill.  great for someone 6'5&#34; or taller.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I think this was the best book of the series, Stephanie Meyer is a fantastic author. I think she should have wrote an epilogue though, shouldn't have ended so quick
B005LAIIHG|3.0|I watched this  on dvd in 2D but I imagine that thew 3D verson would be  brilliant.I am not a 3D fan however and have only seen 3 films in recent years in  3D.Special effects  do not  make a  good movie. It is the story,acting and directing that counts. Ang Lee is a briliant director and does  do a fantastic  job  with this film.  However there were  too many  religious overtones - okay if you  like that sort of thing. It took 20 minutes before  anything started to  get you involved in the  film. A much shorter opening  would have been better.What puzzled me was that we see three dead animals in the boat but a  few minutes later they have dissappeared. Where did they go? If they were eaten by the tiger  then where were the  bones  etc? The trailer for the film ,gave  away  far too much of the story especially after  leaving the boat on the  island.That ruined any suspense that the  film  should have had.The story  was  far fetched  as it would be  extremely  difficult for such an event to occur in real life.It was more like an episode of LOST. I will however watch it again in 3D at home and  see if I  think differently.Others may  disagree with my comments  but everyone is entitled to there own opinion.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love hidden object games so I decided to try the free app.  half way through the game I had to buy the full version but it was worth it. I loved it. :-)

1781164266|5.0|Great artwork from the game series. This book basically spans the 3 games from concept sketches to beautiful character break downs and full renderings of environments and weapon sketches as well as a section of course on the necromorphs.<br />Overall if your a fan of the game you'll probably really enjoy this book. If your an artist its a great reference book to have on the table. Speaking of its a beautiful coffee table book as well. The cover alone is a beautiful matte finish with a few spots of gloss.

1451613512|5.0|The Untold History of the United States is a revealing book about some of the terrible things our government has done in the past 100 years in the name of patriotism.  It is especially eye-opening when the details of our policy regarding the atomic bomb are discussed.  The book is an easy read even though it is very long.  I recommend it to anyone who wants the truth about our foreign policy.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Good book.  Nice to read about such a wonderful musician.  Will keep in my library.  can re-read again and gain.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great idea for a puzzler, and as the difficulty progresses you have to do some thinking.  This is an excellent, unusual take on the &#34;get 3 stars&#34; puzzle app genre.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played the first Temple Run and it was addictive and fun. This one is for the books! Hills, slide lines, mine carts and one huge monkey!! I can't put it down. The graphics are gorgeous, almost seamless and the geography is much varied than in the last game, and it retains its sick sense of humor when you die. As a matter of fact, this game is much better than the original, and it's free! You have to give this one a try!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the best game ever way better then temple run 1 bye bye bye bye subdue djndhsjns jdjd hdjdjdb djhdhdbbzb hdhdhshbz hdhdhhdhd
B008602KQI|3.0|Unlike the book the main character is too pretty and well fed and this part bothered me because it removes credibility to her intentions and motivations.<br />The Hollywood beautiful teeth and heathy people do not fit properly.<br />The story was close enough that I enjoyed it but felt that it was too summarized and wouldn't have a crowd of followers would it not have been for the wonderful books.
B000002GB9|5.0|Grand Illusion is the greatest of all the great Styx albums. The guitar riff on \\"Man in the Wilderness\\" takes me back to a simpler time and still pumps me up like it did when I was a teenager.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Who doesn't like a good wedding scene?<br />This one does not disappoint and the season brings a lot of turns and surprises, the plot thickens and we are drawn even deeper in this falling of era and the precarious future of Downton Abbey and its family and servants.
B0012QVJXS|4.0|Always a lot of fun to watch this movie.  My kids were comparing it to the events throughout the seasons of Smallville.
B008O51872|5.0|I am so thrilled with this little mixer, it has added so much dimension to my podcast. It works great with Audacity software. I spent a few minutes messing with it, and was recording in no time. It's very simple to use, and has made such a difference in the sound of my show. I could easily be using this to record great music and many other things. The on board effects are great and really add depth to my talk show.
0345803507|2.0|This book is not what I would normally read.  It's more Hype than it worth!  I would not recommend this to anyone I know.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I bought three of these for my podcast, and they sound great. They are not toy mics, but should be for the price. If you were not looking you'd think someone handed you a $100 microphone. If my show expands I will buy more of these great mics.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I love puzzles...and this is a fun way to take along and challenge myself to finish the puzzles within a certain length of time either at home or when I travel
B0049P1VHS|5.0|For zombie fans like me, this show is a dream come true. With intense gore, heavy drama, and just enough profanity to be entertaining, &#34;season 1&#34; is awesome.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|This was an awesome book because it had lots and lots of action and adventure so that it's pretty hard to get bored by the end of the book. So if you love action And adventure then this book is defiantly for you.
B004XVMCPI|5.0|Proof that humour transecends cultural boundaries, \\"Shaolin Soccer\\" is possibly the best sports comedy ever. With great martial arts action, Zucker-style nonsense, and brilliant performances, \\"SS\\" is packed with crying, pee-in-your-pants insanity. Buy this DVD!!!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Saw this in theaters, rented it again when it came it. This movie is nothing like the book, if anything it's LOOSELY based on the book. One might say it's slightly over the top, but it's epic and awesome, the movie is worth seeing and the book is worth reading. Great acting, great stor, great albeit over the top effects. One I could watch again and again if in the mood for an action packed thriller.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I've had this or some time. It works good on Kindle Fire HD. Best of all it's free. If it's free it's for me.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I had conflicting WiFi issues with my neighbors being on the same WiFi channel, this tool has an awesome graphical interface to determine the best channel to set your WiFi router on.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I've had this game for some time. It's ok, but they want money. This is why I game it a one star because it's not free. This game is only free for a little bit.
0446582778|5.0|I'm a great fan of Harry Bosch - in fact I'd no idea about Hieronymouse Bosch (the painter) when I first started reading the series.<br /><br />This book is one of the best (if not THE best) of the Bosch books. Just couldn't put it down!
B008KE3960|4.0|I've had this game for some time. It works good on Kindle Fire HD. Best of all it's free.Fun!!! Worth the download.
0141802766|3.0|this is a review of the audiobook, which is unabridged<br /><br />I found it quite hard to get into, which is unlike me<br />some parts were really good but at other times it seemed to drag a bit<br /><br />I don't think I will get another by Ken Follett - many others write better in the same genre.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've had this for some time. I used it for a alarm clock. It works well. If you need a free alarm clock this one works great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever!!! I play it 24/7.You should make a second one but with more obstacles so it's harder and fun I should now because I'm only a kid.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had this game for some time. It's a good free game. If you want a game to relax this is a game for you.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game when u have a little spare time on your hands. I like simulater games like building  your own town. I like how there's trucks Nd trash trucks that actually do work. Fun game

0062082353|4.0|I loved the book only took a about a day and half to finish. True American hero...its with great sadness that his life was taken....I feel for the family, seemed like a great relationship.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I've had this game for some time. It works good on Kindle Fire HD. Best of all it's free. It's fun for a little wil if you want something mindless.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good version and easy to play,  good graphics and good speed. the only problem is that some ads are hard to close
B0002A2WDQ|2.0|I recommend purchasing this DVD even though I think the movie itself stinks.  Why, you say?  I suggest you buy the DVD for the music; the sound track CD does not have all the good blues that is in the movie.  Both the DVD and CD are available on Amazon. Ry Cooder, Sonny Terry, and Steve Vai are the folk who provide the great blues which is the redeeming virtue of this movie that is a writer's fantasy with little basis in fact.  If you were suckered into buying the soundtrack CD, the missing Head Cutting tracks can be purchased individually from Steve Vai's \\"Elusive Sight and Sound\\" CD (  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188Q8B8/ref=dm_sp_alb?ie=UTF8&qid=1360281762&sr=8-2-fkmr0).    If you want to see everything the sound track CD discards visit the Wikipedia url:  [...] which shows you the CD soundtrack contents and the actual movie's blues content.    While you are at it consider purchasing a copy of the Paganini Caprice No. 5 (http://www.amazon.com/24-Caprices-Op-1-2000-Remaster/dp/B000TETANA/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1360279209&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=izakh+perlman+caprice+5+paganini  ).  That is what Steve Vai quotes when he is playing \\"Eugene's Trick Bag\\" (Ralph Macchio did play Eugene in the movie but he did not play the guitar in the movie).    If you are looking for the the \\"missing Robert Johnson song\\", one of the movie's themes, and you have a feel for what Johnson's work sounds like you would do better to listen to the work of Robert \\"Jr.\\" Lockwood who was essentially mentored by Robert Johnson.    With regard to another of the movie's themes, Robert Johnson doing a Faustian deal in exchange for his guitar chops, you might want to research a little known Alabama born transplanted Mississippi bluesman named Ike Zimmerman who mentored Johnson after Johnson was stung by the deprecation of his picking ability by the likes of established bluesmen Brown (yes, the same Willie Brown from the movie), Charlie Patton and Son House.    If the Amazon starsystem were more flexible,  I would give the movie itself one star and the music from the movie 4.5 stars.  Cooder and Vai do some really great guitar work in this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved reading this book, I would recommend it to everyone i know, can't wait to read the next one!!
B003L77G06|2.0|I think the second season is not as good as the first season. I had gotten my daughter hooked by ordering the first season so I had to order the second. It did not compare. Although, the package arrived very quickly..it was a big dissapointment.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game<br />Totally enjoy this little game<br /><br />It's a lot of fun.  My kids enjoy playing it as much as I do.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie was great. I originally saw it in the movie theater and having my own copy is also great. I enjoyed the second disc with all the special effects and interviews. The price was also great and I quickly got the DVD in a very short time.
0345803507|5.0|As I've teared through books 1 and 2 of this series, I couldn't wait to get through the ending...what would become of Christian and Anastasia??  Was it repetitive at times? Yes.  But, E.L. James seemed like she had a point and wanted to get it across.  We also learn what Christian was thinking during his first introduction to Ms. Steele.  As, I've said in other reviews, it's a bunch of soap opera/porn crap, but it makes for an oh so good read!  Guilty Pleasure #1 over the Christmas Holidays!  Pick up the trilogy...you may as well, because you won't be able to get this duo out of your mind, until you see it through to the end!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This movie  was fun to watch. I especially liked the special features. I grew up with family that is part of the American armed forces and it was nice to see our Navy working with the director on getting the accurate representation of the ships and the naval influence in Pearl Harbor.
0345803485|5.0|So, let's get one thing straight, Fifty Shades of Gray is a soap opera/porn movie wrapped up into one.  It's total crap, but it's really great all in one.  I was late to jump on the bandwagon, but once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.  Read it in 2 days!!!
B002QKZLZ6|2.0|I expected a belt loop to make it a carrying case.  Now it is a just a pocket or briefcase holder.
0345803493|5.0|Book Two-Christian Gray & Anastasia Steele are at it again!  If you've already taken the time out of your life to read the first book, you may as well move on in the trilogy...I mean aren't you curious?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is fun,  entertaining, and a great way to kill time. I'm a nanny so I have to spend a lot of time waiting for my girls to get out of lessons and other such extra vurricular activities. This game is a great way to kill time in doing so and its also very fun to play.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love the multi locations option, seems to be the most accurate app I have seen in awhile. Would definitely recommend
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I purchased this case on sale for 16.99. At that price point it is a great value. the case is as attractive as a plain case can be and it is fairly well made. The non slip surface on the inside is already starting to show some wear, however time will tell if that gets worse.<br /><br />My only true complaint is that you have to rotate the Kindle placement in order to charge the Kindle while using the case. Otherwise this is the best value I have seen for the auto sleep/wake and free standing features, certainly compared to Amazon's $40.00+ case offering.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love the app......and have many others using it for personal and business uses....i use it alot.. enjoy it so much
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game definitely keeps you challenged. I love the various packages available.  Challenge your brain and when you get stuck buy hints.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love this album!  All of the songs are awesome--there is not a bad song!  Although I only recently downloaded the MP3 album, I've already listened to it several times.
B004QBWU02|5.0|I love this movie! The music in the film is superb! It is the music I grew up with, even though I was born in 1991. Watching this movie was like going to heaven! Hearing the music of the 1950's/Early 1960's, seeing the cars driving around, & seeing a real high school dance, was a dream come true. It was also cool to see Wolfman Jack. The Disc Jockey use to be special & the Wolfman was terrific. He played all the great Rockin' Roll & Doo Wop music. If you lived during the time or you wished you lived during that time, this is the movie for you. You will want to watch it again & again for the rest of your life! This is the Soundtrack of our lives!
B009GEDP26|5.0|I could watch these episodes on Hulu or ABC as they come out for free, but if you get them off amazon I can watch them in HD, on my smart tv and my laptop, and at the end of the day I own them so they don't expire as new episodes go up. Well worth the $2.84 per episode.
1449415881|5.0|Everyone in the office starts the day reading the daily Dilbert.  Its a great way to get started with a positive attitude.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft so when I heard it was on kindle I immediately bought it. The game runs very well but I have a couple of complaints. My first is where's the redstone? There's another game called survivalcraft that has wiring so I know it's possible. Second, why is the map so small? Once again, survivalcraft's maps are huge! Also, why are flint and steel not in the creative menu? Lastly, the flying in creative mode is TERRIBLE. I have no idea what you guys were thinking by adding drifting while flying in PE. on PC it's manageable but on PE I can't even build a simple house without placing at least 20 extra blocks. Please fix these mistakes in the next couple of updates. I view the game unplayable at the moment because of these errors.
B003L5BRXK|5.0|The Rolling Stones have proven over the years to be the best rock n roll band on earth. I'm 58 and remember hearing Satisfaction in the back seat of our family station wagon going to the beach and thinking &#34;that's MY music&#34;. After 50 years, it still is.
1476719071|5.0|I am totally in love with this book! When I found it with a bunch of my other presents this morning under my tree, I took my books (Beautiful Disaster, Crossed, The Iron Knight and Awake at Dawn) and raced to my room to read them. I really want to read Beautiful Disasters first so I stayed in my room all day instead of being with my family on Christmas Day. I know I probably should be out there right now and watch movies until we all fall asleep passed out all on one couch, but I couldn't. So, I took the books into my room and started reading. After nine hours I finished Beautiful Disasters! The book was amazing.<br /><br />Beautiful Disasters will leave you squealing, crying, grieving and down right annoyed. But I guess that's just me. I don't know about anyone else but if you haven't read this book you have got to read it. I can't wait to read Trent's story. Merry Christmas everyone!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app!  Works great and its very addicting.  Play it on my Kindle Fire and it's hard to put down!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very fun. It helps pass time and its addictive to try to get all of the games
B003QS9TKU|5.0|good clean entertainment for the family.  Kids of all ages really enjoyed the show, and it was fun for my husband and I to watch with them
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Dianna Ross!  I love all the songs she made.  And, all the beautiful tunes with the Supremes.  The Supremes were one of the best girl groups in the world!  Thanks, Diana, for all you gave.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This is a reviting movie...not one to see if you fear flying! The story can be tough to see, but really well done. The cast is super!
B009AMAM9S|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a movie that may be difficult for some to follow unless they are knowledgeable about multiple time-lines and reincarnation.  It is probably one of the most real movies about inter-dimensional lives on the market.  It is wonderfully written and is on the top of my list of movies ever.
0156030306|4.0|Flowers for Algernon is a story about a man, Charles, who has mild retardation and undergoes an operation as an experiment to increase his intelligence.  He befriends a mouse Algernon that also had the surgery. Initially, the mouse is his opponent in several tests for intelligence.  The mouse beats the man at the beginning, but over time, Charlie's intelligence increases, and he is able to beat Algernon, the mouse.  Charlie also begins to learn about the cruel world he lives in as he becomes smarter.  As time moves on, the mouse begins to deteriorate and eventually dies.  Charlie assumes the same for himself.  His relapse begins and he forgets all he learned except the cruelty of the world.<br /><br />This would be a great book to read as a middle school team activity or as a bullying group exercise. This would be a good story to have students read allowed in a group or individually in order to promote discussions.  There are certainly several talking points such as how we treat people, misunderstanding individuals' thoughts and perceptions, is the grass greener on the other side, and many others.<br /><br />The book certainly creates a feeling of empathy for other individuals with disabilities, specifically learning disabilities or mental retardation.  It really allows the reader to have the same perception as the main character and live some of the moments of joy and sadness he feels.  The reader gets a sense of the delayed processing and associated emotions the character is going through by reading his journal entries.  Several examples throughout the book demonstrate how individuals with delayed processing may take things very literally and this is important to consider when working in the classroom.<br /><br />A few parts of the story allowed criticism.  I did not think it was appropriate for the book to insinuate that individuals with mental retardation were not necessarily mature.  As the main character becomes \\"smarter,\\" he develops feelings of love for histeacher and he notes in his journal that as he becomes smarter, she becomes more younger looking and prettier, whereas before his operation, she appeared old and genius-like.  He begins to notice details about her such as her hair and eyes.  I think all people are capable of love regardless of their intellectual capability.  Another criticism is when Charlie relapses from the operation and begins to forget everything he learned, he basically returns to his pre-operational state.  This insinuates that people with mental retardation are unable to retain information over long periods of time, which is a point of disagreement. With the correct tools, strategies, and motivation, all individuals have the ability to learn.<br /><br />Overall, it is a GREAT story with lots of discussion points!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't know how this book will go over with the non-80s, non-geeky crowd, but I thought it was fun and clever.

B003QSPTAY|5.0|I remember seeing this on when it came out in the movies as a child.  I is still great fun for the young and young at heart
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I needed a long cord to connect webcam for 'security' set up, 10 m length did the trick, and good cheep price.
0802473156|4.0|I bought the book with just the tiniest tear on the binding. I bought it new. Besides that, the book came on time. It's a great book! Will probably end up getting more of Gary Chapman's books.
0802130208|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a professor at a university. I really thought it would get better once I started understanding all the characters. In reality I wanted to meet the main character and punch him in the face. He is not a lovable character or one that learns his lesson in the end. I did enjoy the description of the setting and could actually hear these characters come to life in my head.
B00094OBS4|1.0|I guess much to My misinformation, it is in a PAL format that won't play on US DVD player's. How ever, My computer can play it so I'm going to keep it. I have gotten 2 DVD's that are in this PAL format so now I know to look out for them. Frankly anything that come's from the UK We can NOT use here. Oh well.... live and learn...
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Great video to show my 8th grade GT class. Our annual theme is all about change. What is happening, what will happen, what can we do to change the future both in positive and negative ways. Great discussion piece.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Iron Man is a great movie. I like how Robert Downey Jr. plays the part. I love all the action and special effects.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|The Butterfly Effect is a pretty interesting suspense.  The pacing is highly original and different from anything I've ever seen before.  If you think Ashton Kutcher plays a comedian here, guess again!  This is a suspense from beginning to end with several twists and turns giving it plenty of replay value.  Not the kind of movie you're used to seeing starring Ashton Kutcher, that's for sure.<br /><br />It's about Ashton having the ability to travel back in time and change certain traumatic events so they never happen, leading to the future events to play out differently.  Quite often he changes things for the worse but it's not realized until later on in surprising fashion.  This is the theme throughout the ENTIRE film.  Some like it, others don't.  To give one example, a girl who's molested by her father ends up having a rough lifestyle as an adult.  However in one segment Ashton goes back and changes this, so now she's a more respectable and likeable woman in the future.  This is just one example- there's a LOT more.  If I reveal every single one, I'd end up spoiling the entire film.  Ashton is the only one who does the time travelling however- but his 3 friends (a girl and two boys all with their own highly unusual personalities) have their own disturbing dilemmas.<br /><br />Now when I say Ashton travels back in time, he's not using a time machine or anything like that.  Instead the movie opts for simple \\"blink of the eye\\" time travelling after Ashton reads certain lines from a notebook.  One second he's an adult, the next he's back in time as a child and changing the future with his friends.  Really cool special effects are briefly used so the viewers can see the actual travelling.<br /><br />Now, you're probably wondering what kind of horrible traumatic events ARE we seeing?  Well to name the main ones- the kids blow up a mailbox using dynamite that leads to a few deaths, the one blonde-haired boy tortures a trapped dog tied up in a bag, and of course, the girl being molested.  Ashton goes back in time and changes these events.<br /><br />For the first 20 minutes you'll probably be REALLY confused but please, stick with the entire thing.  The storyline pretty much demands your entire attention.  Highly recommended.  I really have no complaints other than the confusing 20 minutes in the beginning.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is another classic movie. I like all the special effects. I think Dick Van Dyke is a good actor and plays the part well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for the next season!  The acting, characters, and scenery are superb!  This series draws you in and leaves off with an ending that makes you anxious for the next episode.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I don't like it. I never bought this CD. My girlfriend used to play this CD almost every day, that i almost learned the whole thing.<br />I know that i am going to get a lot of thumbs down , but this is how it is.<br />First of all...some of her songs here are stolen. I hear some Madonna, some Ace of Base, some Boney M, some Queen.<br />Get inspired by others, drop some beats, the same old love- sex lyrics ...do some ''shocking'' videos, perform in underwear, get a Marilyn Manson kinda look and the success is on the way.<br />Sorry. I'm not falling for an artist like her. Wait...she is a marketing product.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|Helpful! Still getting used to using the Kindle. There is  alot to learn. Thanks for hte help and tips. Thanks
B000002NJS|5.0|First thing first : i don't listen to this kind of music. Nothing like Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Kate Perry and others.<br />I used to know songs by Madonna , but i never got into her music. This also, comes from a headbanger.<br />When ''Frozen'' started to be played on TV, i feel in love right away. With the video, the lyrics, the electronic sound of it. I bought the album. And i still listen to it in 2013.<br />Madonna released this album one year later after The Prodigy dropped The Fat of the Land. The album that changed the music. Other artists were also influenced by the Prodigy. David Bowie and his ''Earthling'' or U2 ''Pop''.<br />Is a very experimental album full of electronic- dance- jungle -tribal beats. The lyrics are also interesting.<br />Favorite songs : Swim, Ray of Light, Candy perfume girl, Nothing really matters, Shanti/ Ashtangi, Frozen, Power of Goodbye.

0800141806|5.0|I liked the movie Philadelphia very much.  All of  the actors were excelllent.  I received sooner than I expected. I will order again.<br /><br />Betty Loew
0439023483|4.0|Okay, so I wasn't expecting to really like the book, and it's not that this isn't the sort of thing I like to read...in fact , it is. But I'm always wary of such huge cultural phenomena such as this series. Sometimes, though, there really IS a reason why a book like this gets over 13,000 reviews - most of which are really positive.<br /><br />I went ahead and bought it used because it was only $0.99 at a Goodwill and Stephen King endorsed it. That may have been the best buck I've spent in a long time.<br /><br />First, the characters are well drawn. I like the first person perspective from Katniss because it lends a dimension of relationship to the reader that, true has been used well in other books (See: [[ASIN:B005MF8AYQ A Ghost of Fire (Ghostly Elements)]]), but I think it's one of the reasons THIS book has done so well.<br /><br />Second, there's good tension and suspense without relying too much on the horror of what's actually happening (i.e. the bloody deaths of teenaged children). The book is paced really well and the tension builds and you really do end up fretting over whether certain characters are going to make it through the book or not.<br /><br />Third, it's an easy read. The language isn't clunky and it doesn't get in the way. Collins tells the story very simply without going overboard on description, or making the emotions melodramatic.<br /><br />Overall, I give it 4 stars because it's earned them. It's not the most amazing thing I've ever read, but it DOES make me want to jump right into Catching Fire. Happy reading.
0765325950|5.0|Got to me a day before expected which was extremely awesome and with no problems. The book itself was amazing.
1616550414|5.0|This is the book that all fans of Legend of Zelda have been waiting for. Written by Shigeru Miyamoto, the father of such memorable and iconic Nintendo characters such as Mario, Peach, Samus Aran, and of course Link and Zelda, this book is the quintessential story of the whole Legend of Zelda series from the beginning to it's current available title, Skyward Sword. This book has an amazing artwork as well and a manga that depicts the prelude story of Skyward Sword. Any Legend of Zelda fan must have this in their collection, so this makes a perfect gift for them.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|I like all this author's books. Plots are always complicated enough to keep me reading. I would like to think our government isn't as bad as Baldacci thinks but I 'm afraid he is right
B007FEZQF8|5.0|IT JUST CONTINUES TO IMPRESS ME<br /><br />WOW THIS IS JUST CONTINUING TO IMPRESS ME AND THE WORLD THE.I CAN'T BELEIVE THIS BOOK HAS SO MUCH E<br />SUSPENS
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Pretty awesome books.  I couldn't stop reading it. This minimum word count thing is stupid. I just want to give the book 5 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love this a lot better than first would even spend money for it happy its free and you can give it to the elderly and young yerp yerp yerp
B0091REZMW|4.0|Takes awhile to recharge energy but other than that it is a great game. Completely addictive to play and doesn't get old because items are rearranged.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|the ending wasn't my favorite. But overall I enjoyed reading it and had a hard time putting it down. I'm anxious to see the movie version.
B0078ZTWP4|2.0|The lantern is well constructed and descent size. However it is not bright at all. I am not sure what you can use this for. Pitch black and you would be better of with a small LED flashlight.
B0083Z614S|5.0|The reader is taken back to childhood when play and discovery were such fun.  I like classics such as this where there is no vulgar language (unlike a lot of modern-day stories).  I enjoyed it so much that I recommended it to my granddaughter who is in college and an avid reader.
B000MXJ7LS|5.0|it is very true  & realistic about the event that occured on Sept. 11 2001 , it will jerk some tears , garunteed
0765325950|5.0|Have waited for ever for this culmination and I have been well rewarded for my patience. Sanderson did a masterful job tying all the loose ends together. Matt has always been my favorite character and I am well satisfied!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I have been playing this CD in my car non-stop since I've gotten it. Each song Lana Del Rey sings is different and hauntingly beautiful. I always have one of them playing in my head. She's an amazing lyric writer and her songs have such depth and soul. I highly recommend it.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Interesting book detailing criminal investigations of unsolved deaths and detailed writings about their autopsies. Many twists and turns to hold your interest.A true Scarpetta novel worth reading .
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Styles of the decade change, corsets are shed,  babies are born,  horse-drawn carriages give way to convertibles;  there's  a wedding, a funeral, a  jilting, a cancer scare, a new career  for a key character and a sexy boss to go with it,  a fortune lost and a fortune gained,  characters  hired, fired and rehired.  Shirley MacLaine makes one whale of a great guest appearance; characters played by actors who yearn to market their newfound fame on other stages get  killed off; there's also a cricket match, a family trip to Scotland,  and a  character with all the wild and crazy antics we tend to associate with the Roaring Twenties  who makes a  guest appearance in advance of her new role in season four.<br /><br />But you probably knew all that, didn't you?  What you may not know yet is just what's in those \\"over two hours of bonus video\\" in this three-disc, \\"approx. 8.75 hours\\" set.  So here goes:<br /><br />Disc one extras contain: A look at Downton Abbey in 1920, revisits to the storylines of the first two seasons,  interviews with writer/creator Julian Fellowes and several cast and crew members, a visit to Ealing Studios in London where all the Downton downstairs scenes are filmed, a montage of \\"memorable moments\\"  and actors' takes on what they think of the characters they play.<br /><br />The extras on disc three delve into the long and complex  behind-the-scenes activity involved in the season's two weddings...the men of Downton Abbey...cast anecdotes  on what it was like meeting and working  with Shirley MacLaine...and the challenges of  filming a cricket match amid an invasion of  midges and the trip to the Scottish highlands.<br /><br />Unlike with the season one and two videos, the season three discs each include  the same Ralph Lauren and Viking River Cruises PBS sponsor self-promotions that appeared on PBS.  Which may explain why this set of DVDs made its debut priced a little lower than did the first two.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great story for any one, especially for the middle school students.  recom. my friends read, and their kids who are this age.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Hsaving not seen the three movies at the theatre, it was good to have the entire collection. Great resolution throughout.
1408267667|5.0|I loved this dvd.<br />The contents of the dictionary is excellent.<br />It`s helped me a lot in my studies.<br />I recommend you buy.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Only wish  the collection was organized chronologically. I saw the TV version several years back and it was nice to not have all of the bouncing back and forth from one era to another.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I've had these since Christmas and couldn't be happier.  The surround sound is unreal.  I upgraded to these from the X31's and there is no comparison.  You can hear footsteps and the faintest little details that you could never hear through the X31's.  I haven't had any issues with interference and everything is crystal clear.  They can charge while your wearing them and they are very durable and comfortable.  Best headset I've ever had.  Oh, and the voice changing feature is great when you want to prank your friends.  I would definitely buy these again.
B002M9WW30|5.0|It was nice to have the full series/ story on blu ray. Great to watch and have the entire collection
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This apps uses 2/3 of the map screen for nothing. You cannot see a full screen of the weather map.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|Great to have the high resolution video and sound track. First saw at the theatre but after seeing it later, it grew on me. Madonna was the perfect choice for the part of Eva Peron.
B002RI9UBS|2.0|i found this book very difficult to get into, at this stage i have only managed to get to chapter six.
B005R4255C|5.0|This is one my favorite albums of all time now and I am well-pleased with the quality of sound and look forward to purchasing more.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|This movie is a great family movie it's romantic, it's funny, and a fun movie for Halloween I like this movie and I would recommend this movie to friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is better than any running game I would recommend this product To any one because it's fun it's not easy to get people and it's easy too
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run two is fun to play I like that they added more obstacles but I don't like is that you can only slide, jump, and turn I wish you could jump,slide,turn,do flips, go through a tunnel, maybe even some hand springs but other wise the game is pretty good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Do yourself a favor: get enthralled in the Wool Omnibus! Once you've read book one, you will be hooked.  I dare you to put it down!
B004U52VPS|3.0|I am sure there is something of substance to this game, but the box it came in wasn't terribly inviting for all the pieces to be returned to it with care on Christmas day.  We still play with the toys,, but the game is no longer together!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesomeness game it's so much fun want all the hover Board  chickens love soda. Lol sup bro BRONY LOL D<br />a dum
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downtown Abbey Season 3 I used TV pass to watch last three eposodes well worth it.<br /><br />Reccomend this to anyone that is unable to wait for 2-24-13 to roll around.<br /><br />Can't wait for season 4 now I'm hooked.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is more challenging fun and very cool to me I think this  game is the best better than the first
B008133MDK|5.0|Sherlock Season 2 is as stunning as season 1.  I hope this series continues for a very, very long time.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|The premise of this book is a difficult concept to grasp but made for okay reading. I found it difficult to get into and finished it only because I had started it. Normally I find the good reads are difficult to lay down and I am anxious to get back to but this book wasn't like this. It is a &#34;time filler&#34; for me and probably will not read again.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Sherlock is beautifully filmed and very true to the original storyline, yet wonderfully updated to modern London.  The imagery and character development is wonderful.
B0000019PA|5.0|In The Aeroplane Over the Sea is no ordinary album. While it could possibly be crowned for being the grandfather of indie rock, do not dismiss this album by slapping the indie rock label on it that I feel is seen a lot today. There are instruments on here that I can't even name other from a trumpet and from what I looked up: apparently a saw. I'm dead serious.<br /><br />There are lyrics on here that make no sense... \\"Semen stains the mountain tops\\" being a reoccurring one. But you know what? That is what makes this album the masterpiece that it is. Listening to this album and expecting logic is like eating cake and expecting to taste broccoli, it is so vast and makes at times no sense that... it's good. Really good.<br /><br />If I were to write an album like this it would be panned by critics around the world and would be dismissed as the worst album to ever exist ever. I guarantee that. However Jeff Magnum, lead singer/guitarist/songwriter pulls it off. The songs are very simple, and being a guitar player I could say that I can name most of the chords as they are played in the songs, and a beginner guitarist could easily play some of these songs. But the simplicity of these songs is probably what blows me away the most: so much depth in such few, simple chords. Yet, songs like \\"Oh Comely\\" and \\"Two Headed Boy\\" have sophisticated song structures, with random key changes, bridges, and added parts that I don't think can even be labeled with words like \\"Verse\\" and \\"Chorus\\"... the songs are too complex.<br /><br />But I just contradicted myself by saying the songs are too complex. That's the thing: basic terms don't describe this album. It's a rush of confusion and clarity at the same time. Magnum's voice is the most beautiful and most ugly thing at the same time. I can't recommend enough to give this album a listen, and listen to it ALL the way through as all these songs are good. This is such a weird album, and at that such a timeless masterpiece and a classic.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Oh, and I looked up the instruments used on this album, credit to Wikipedia for this (great source, I know):<br />- Guitar, Bass, Drums... obvious<br />- Trumpet, Trombone, Saxophone, Piano, Organ... obvious again<br />- Zanzithophone (Supposedly just a MIDI Saxophone...)<br />- Flugelhorn<br />- Uilleann pipes<br />- Singing saw<br />- Euphonium<br /><br />Some are just slightly different horns... but still. Pretty diverse in my opinion.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Oh, and I looked up the instruments used on this album, credit to Wikipedia for this (great source, I know):<br />- Guitar, Bass, Drums... obvious<br />- Trumpet, Trombone, Saxophone, Piano, Organ... obvious again<br />- Zanzithophone (Supposedly just a MIDI Saxophone...)<br />- Flugelhorn<br />- Uilleann pipes<br />- Singing saw<br />- Euphonium<br /><br />Some are just slightly different horns... but still.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|THE RACKETEER was recommended to me by a woman who was reading it by a swimming pool in Maui.  Fun reading and hard to believe. Just let the mind roll with it.  I have read (or heard) most of Grisham's books.  This one challenges my imagination.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has amassed quite a following in the past decade, and as I write this it is about ten years since the release of A Rush of Blood to the Head (writing in 2013, album released in 2003). I remember seeing Coldplay on channels like VH1 and MTV when they started to take off with this album and especially when [[ASIN:B0006L16N8 X&Y]] came out, however never diverged into their discography. Years later I've come to this album and [[ASIN:B0000508U6 Parachutes]] to finally start listening, and I have to say that this album is phenomenal.<br /><br />To me this album sums up a lot of emotions: anger, sorrow, regret, guilt, anxiety, and many others that I think everyone reading this and that has listened to this album can say they've experienced. Songs like \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" provide a darker tone to the album, and while it is a dark song there are parts when the whole band comes in to accompany in progressions that are just PERFECT and provide that relief that a good chorus in a song provides... however these parts aren't chorus'. Take a listen and you may see what I mean.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a song like \\"Clocks\\" is uplifting and \\"Green Eyes\\" is pure sorrow. This album is truly a grab bag of a bunch of really well written songs, and I fully support that. Coldplay has gotten some cred for being \\"whiny\\" (like the stupid Family Guy skit) however I didn't experience a moment when I thought \\"Damn this singer either is really moody or must have a real sucky life\\".<br /><br />The lyrics were never over the top dramatic or underwhelming to the point where they make no sense: they are at times relatable, paint a good image and at times are just good food for thought. My favorite lyrics, I have to admit, are probably from Green Eyes: \\"Honey you are a rock, upon which I stand...\\" That entire song has some lyrics that beat any Pop song about break ups any day. Then again that whole song surpasses any Pop song about break ups.<br /><br />A Rush of Blood to the Head is an album full of really well written, deep and thoughtful songs. Not emo, not whiny... just for the ones stuck in a rut.<br /><br />Personal Favorites: God Put A Smile Upon Your Face, Clocks, Daylight, Green Eyesis an album full of really well written, deep and thoughtful songs. Not emo, not whiny... just for the ones stuck in a rut.<br /><br />Personal Favorites: God Put A Smile Upon Your Face, Clocks, Daylight, Green Eyes
006016848X|5.0|i purchased this on cd years ago it helped me and it help my brothers marriage. so i bought the book for my son and his girlfriend who are always fussing about the small stuff..hoping this would help them to get alone better
B008CP92ZO|5.0|I liked the pairing of Paul and Jennifer. It was definitely sutuational comedy and pretty good.<br />I recommend it for a late night movie or rainy day movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book from the start. This has been added to my &#34;favorites&#34; in my kindle and is one that i will read over and over and over and never get tired of reading it!! READ IT!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Kept me on edge every episode. Keeps me hanging on like the Series &#34;24&#34;. More cliffhanging than any show I've ever seen including Dexter.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|fun app that i like to play with my nephews, sometimes the words are hard to draw but we have fun anyway
B007MJKOY4|3.0|Not the nail biter I thought it would be, but good enough for a good movie night in my lounge chair with the Chiuaua on my lap and munching popcorn.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 7 yr old daughter loves this game.  It has more options than Temple Run 1 and you can unlock different players (even a girl).
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This trilogy is not what I expected but definitely worth reading and very addictive. Is a must have if reading book 1. I would highly advise purchase prior to finishing book 1!!
B004498KPU|5.0|A must have for any Michael Jackson lover. This collection is perfect in every way. Thriller is still the quintessential video for MJ.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|People complained about batman's speech. Instead of toning it down,  they gave us more. Much more. Too much. Alfred also had a lot to say, which was also uncharacteristic.  But they gave the role to  Michael Cain, which was a bad idea because he has to take a back seat to a lessor actor, Christian Bale. So they gave Alfred a long monologue, and it was awful.  Not what he said, but because they expected us to believe Alfred would do this.  I didn't buy it for a second. Ann Hatheway, who is lovely, was not the best catwoman. Nowhere near as good as Michelle Pfeiffer.  I liked Bane, even though it sounded like someone giving the WORST Sean Connery impression.<br /><br />Actors aside, the biggest problem I had with this film was, almost every scene was shot during the day.  I mean, this is Batman.  Did they forget that bats are nocturnal.  They guy wears all black to give him an advantage AT NIGHT.  It completely did away with the concept of Batman, i.e. nocturnal, mysterious, shadowy, cloaked, QUIET!  Even the dark dangerous hell of a prison that Bane was supposedly born and raised was lit up like a Christmas tree. I just didn't get it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is full of wonderful ideas and advices. We can go to review and cook. I love it. It is addictive, I can stop watching it. All the topics are interesting. Thanks to everybody for their contributions
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was excellent, I could not put it down and was anxious to get home from work to continue reading it each day.  I hope the movie does it justice.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really hope that Andy Weir continues to write,  The Martian was a great read.  Deep in the book I realised that the main character Mark Watney should have a place at Mars named after him.  He really deserves that.  So you guys at Nasa,  as Mark himself suggest in the book,  what do you say about \\"the Watney Triangle\\"?<br /><br />This is a book for men.  A page turner - excitement,  humour and action.  This story could easily be a good film -  and of course Tom Hanks should be Watney as  he has experience with Apollo 13 and Cast Away.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this book.
B00AOB3FES|5.0|my grandson loves it!!!! a movie for all generations!! gotta love trussty and jock and of course lady and the tramp!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I might only b 9 but I luv this gayme!!!!!!!!!!!! so kool!!!!! it is rlly fun to play its amazyn from one direction111<br />!!!!!!
B00ANW33CM|3.0|I am having trouble turning the cubes of tile. It may be that I just need more practice, but it is somewhat frustrating at this point. I will keep trying to master it.
B005EM3I6M|5.0|I've read 2 of the 5 books and just think Emily Griffin's writing is  just so --- readable!  I've learned not to anticipate which way the story is going but let EG tell it her way.  Someone described her writing as &#34;spare&#34; but I think her writing shows careful editing.  She tells you enough but doesn't overwhelm the reader with tortuous verbosity and that makes for a most enjoyable experience.  Someone else wrote that EG writes &#34;chick lit.&#34;  I scrunched my nose up at that one.  But she does have a knack for finding these interesting topics to examine and while they're not totally remote or obscure, they're not topics that most of us have thought about.  How many of us know a girl who learned how to play the drums?  Well, such a girl is the main character in one of EG's books.  EG's full of surprises!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have trouble turning my brain off, but with the waves crashing against the beach, I fall fast asleep and seem to stay asleep for longer periods of time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love Downton Abby , it is one of the best series I have ever seen very well worth watching and paying a low price for the third season. Can't wait to see the other 3 episodes after they air .
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I can't find anything bad to say...or even negative to say....about this one. I love it. Like love? You'll love this. Like Collin Firth? You'll love this.....and so on. Adore this one!
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I remember this movie from growing up, but couldn't find it in a store anywhere. Great price for a great classic film.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I liked this book.  I don't know that much about the Indian culture to know how much is true, but I am pretty sure that the cooking, and traditions shared are right on track.<br />I thought the insight of a adopted girl, and both sides of the family are heart warming and heart wrenching at the same time.  Anyone with a teenage daughter will relate to Asha in this book.  Anyone who is a mother will also relate to the struggles and rewards of motherhood as an adopting family or a traditional family.  There are no guarantees how children turn out despite a mother's best efforts.  I also find that the connections a family makes with extended family can be rewarding and enlightening to understanding each other in this book and real life.<br />This may not be a strong literary book, but a nice work of fiction writing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app! try it your self you will love it! after I'll play more plus it is free,
B009JBWOU0|4.0|This is a nice collection package that makes a great gift. All 3 modern Batman films in a neat case. While not very child friendly, young teens to older adults should find it entertaining. The 3rd film will leave you wondering if there will be future films. I won't spoil anything but I will say they tease very nicely.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|love the series, but way too many characters are killed for my my liking...  I guess it was true to the times.. but, oh so much heartbreak
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|It was fun. It is silly that you only get 1/2 the game then have to pay another 4.99$ for the levels past 6. I prefer Wedding Dash.
B000002W9Q|5.0|I grew up in the era,  have watched the movie loads of times,  and now I have the CD.  Fantastic !!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This has to be the very best books I have read in years!  I am truly sorry that there will be no mysteries for these characters to solve.
0765325950|3.0|All kidding and snark aside, I feel like a widower leaving the cemetary after a soured marriage has ended with the death (by natural causes) of a bi-polar spouse.  Tonight on the Red Line I fnished the final volume of 'The Wheel of Time.'  The passionate book affair of my youth that grew stale, bitter and embarrassing before rekindling into acceptance, fondness, and nostalgia has ended. Thank the Light.<br /><br />Some thoughts with, forgive me (or don't forgive me. Bite me), spoilers-<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />- Egwen al'Vere. I always knew this was about Egwene, and in the end, she delivered and left the stage without needing an encore.<br /><br />- Rand al'Thor.  After passing through what Joseph Campbell called the Apotheosis in 'The Heroe's Journey,' Rand became likeable again, and I was again invested in his success.<br /><br />- al'Lan Mandragoran.  Yes, he is the grizzled, gruff, wounded archetypical hero we've seen numerous times, often wearing the face of Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, John Wayne, etc., but I'm a sucker for that character everytime.<br /><br />- People died, almost too many.  While not ballsy enough to go all \\"Game of Thrones\\" and kill off principle characters when the story needed to go there (except once), neither was the Last Battle a gutless \\"Deathly Hallows\\" finale that only offed C-list players.<br /><br />- The point of view (as with George RR Martin's novels, but for different reasons) slid off the main characters a lot.  This annoyed many readers, but I think was necessary as we have spent over 9,000 pages with those characters as written by Robert Jordan before he died, and each moment spent with those characters as written by another author put the reader in peril of tripping over something that would not have rung true.<br /><br />- Androl and Pevara.  Two of he C-listers whom Sanderson pushed to the fore beguiled me with their sweet, funny, romantic discovery and acceptance of each other. And Androl's never-explained-yet-mysterious backstory kept my interest as well.<br /><br />- Min Farshaw.  Love you, babe.  Have always loved you.  Sanderson did not lose your essence.<br /><br />- \\"Horn of Valere, we haven't seen you for, like, what? 11 thousand pages? Good to have you back. We all learned back in volume 2 that you are monogamous, and once blown, can't be blown by anyone else until the most recent hornsounder dies.  Mat Cauthon blew you in 'The Great Hunt' and then \\"died\\" briefly in 'The Shadow Rising.' I don't know why it took another 8 thousand pages before anyone figured out that you were single again, but I must say that your new hornsounder was, for me, perfect.\\"<br /><br />- Birgitte's final rescue of the useless Elayne Trakand.  One shouldn't kill a warder out of Legend when the Horn of Valere is within sounding distance.  Others apparently hated this turn of events, but I loved it.<br /><br />- Lanfear's end game.  Thank goodness the witch who opened the Bore did not try to pull a 'Return of the Jedi' move to redeem herself.<br /><br />- Alivia.  I did not see it coming, but she did indeed fulfill the foretelling that she would \\"help Rand die.\\"<br /><br />- Nynaeve didn't tug on her hair once (because the author wisely burnt off her braid in some heated kerfluffle in, I believe, volume 13).<br /><br />- The gift on one last, lingering question: How did Rand Al'Thor light his pipe in the final chapter?  One last, unanswerable question, and Sanderson himself has stated that he doesn't know the answer, only that Jordan wrote the event into the last chapter before he died.<br /><br />THE ODD:<br /><br />- ONLY TWO YEARS HAS PASSED SINCE MOIRAINE AND LAN TOOK THE BOYS AND EGWENE OUT OF THE TWO RIVERS?  Really?  The online authorities seem to agree with that timeline, but it doesn't seem right.<br /><br />- Did the Last Battle really need to be fought on 4 fronts, then 2 fronts plus a metaphysical throwdown between the Dragon Reborn and the Dark One?  Seems like it should have all gone down at Shayol Ghul.<br /><br />- Moiraine Damodred and Thom Merrilin?  Like romantic?  This was hinted at so much after her \\"death\\" 3 or 4 thousand pages into the story that I had hoped we were being tricked into considering it a possibility even though there had been almost zero indication of it up to that point.  But no, they ended up being a thing, a married thing, an Aes Sedai and her gleeman warder thing.<br /><br />- Rand did an Elphaba at the end.  I won't say whether it was the Elphaba move from the musical or the novel, just that I was not expecting it and am unsure if I wholly approve.<br /><br />THE DISAPPOINTING:<br /><br />- Demandred's secret identity was . . . Demandred.  I'm serious.  Really, I am.  It was a lamer reveal than the Final 5 Cylons.  I was hoping that Demandred would be someone like Talmanes or, even better and more painful, Tam al'Thor (which, I know, would have meant Demandred would have had to have escaped from Shayol Ghul at least 20 years before the other Forsaken).<br /><br />- Siuan Sanche deserved a better.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />- Perrin.  You shouldn't be married to Faile Bashere  You should be living in Brooklyn and dating Karen Cartwright or Rachel Berry.  Get over yourself.<br /><br />- The Last Battle.  The scion of good faces the heart of evil.  Hot Channing-Tatum-as-Buddhist-Jesus-with-a-Sword against a blank, black wall that talks with its CAPS LOCK ON.  What did we realy expect them to accomplish other than a long, repetitive, slightly disjointed and simple-minded contemplation of \\"What is evil?\\", \\"What is free will?\\" and the dumb resolution that humans can be good and have free will and live a happy, trolloc-free existence if we just lock the devil up in an unbreakable cage and forget he exists.<br /><br />- Oh, 11 thousand pages in and now we have a gay male character mentioned in passing?  Too little.  Too late.<br /><br />- Demandred last lived at the end of an age of peace dominated by high technology and magic, but he is somehow a master swordsman whose skill is unequalled by any in the present age (who have had 30 generations of low tech war in which to perfect their skill at killing each other)?  That's just stupid.<br /><br />- Demandred last lived at the end of an age of peace, but he is somehow an almost un-equalled military strategist and general? That's just (see above).<br /><br />- THOSE BASTARDS KILLED BELA!?!?!?
0374275637|2.0|While I appreciate the effort that Kahneman has put into his research over the years and this book, I just couldn't make it past Part 3 without wanting to throw the book across the room.<br /><br />The writing is incredibly dry and tedious. . . so bad that it completely killed any interest that I had left in the book by Part 3.<br /><br />If you think that you would enjoy hearing about his dead friend Amos repeatedly, stories from his time in the Israeli Defense Forces, vacation's with his wife, and are accustomed to getting an intellectual high off of reading a college statistics or algebra textbook, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />2/5 for effort.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Three best of Batman movies in a bundle. Batman begins, The dark knight and The dark knight rises...this is a very good package and the pricing is right, I don't think there are any other  movie  bundles comes as good as this. Not forgetting the movie and special features disc included. Total of 5 blu rays in the package. I would recommend friends to get the bundles as a collection.
B005Z28M58|5.0|I loved this series throughout its entire eight-season run.  The four lead characters were so engaging, and no matter how outlandish things got around them, there was always the very human element of their love, for each other and for their families, that held everything together.  At times laugh-out-loud funny, at times suspenseful and dramatic, at times so touching,  Desperate Housewives is one of the best series ever.
030758836X|1.0|This book started off interesting, had good character development, then got a little disturbing, and finally at the end had you saying seriously???  HORRIBLE ENDING.  Wasn't realistic and did not make sense.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Different from the movie....but great just the same.  Also easy to<br /> picture what the characters look like having the watched the movie first.  All in all an easy  and enjoyable read.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I loved it. I love all the Reacher books.  I listen to the Reacher's books on CD and the man reading the book is wonderful.  I can just see Reacher.
B00683JK9K|3.0|Magic Puzzles Seasons.  A little hard to play.  It should be free.  Not something I'd use alot.  Three more words
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I loved it. I love all the Reacher books.  I listen to the Reacher's books on CD and the man reading the book is wonderful.  I can just see Reacher.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great, great CD.  I liked their prior CD, but skipped many of the songs which were just okay for me.  Babel has more banjo (love banjo!) and overall is a stronger album.  Buy it!
1584282584|5.0|This extremely easy to read book helped me understanding everything I was doing wrong with my flash photography. The book has nice a nice flow without the the fluff. I would recommend this title to anyone planning on using a speed light.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|My new favorite Christmas album!  I read the reviews prior to purchasing, and I agree with the sentiment that if you like Annie Lennox, and you like Christmas, you'll love this album!
B00B7ERH04|1.0|Why can't the video camera setting be for free with no camcoins to get it. One day it'll be for free. But camera is free
0756659841|5.0|These Lego Sticker books are great to keep kids occupied in restaurants, etc, or just at home as a quiet option for kids.  Great gifts!
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Excellent product. Running fine so far in an old Dell PE1900 server functioning now as a backup domain controller for organization
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Excellent story. Read the book and thought my husband would enjoy it for one of his long road trips :)
B00338QENI|5.0|A very good history of medical progress. Very touching story of a family's struggle with the medical field and the callousness with which the medical community deals with the needs of these families.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this game and use it when I have to wait somewhere. It certainly passes the time, even when you are just bored at home.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Engaging, well-written and well acted.  The characters continue to evolve and show a flexibility and belief<br />in person change that is endearing.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like having the weather channel so that I can check on the weather no matter where I am.<br />I especially recommend it when we have bad weather.  Everyone needs to stay aware of weather.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|i really like this puzzle game, and how you get different pictures with each texture style and how its not the same images with each grouping
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I'm a big fan of animation but this one far surpassed my expectations! It was well done and the actors made the characters. I can't wait to see it again!
B005HE5J7I|5.0|Great &#34;sweeping&#34; historical fiction.  Each chapter covers a different period in time; almost like a collection of short stories.  I'm glad I bought it!
B001GJ3BR8|5.0|I thought that it was fantastic, much better than the theatrical cut. There was a really cool subplot to this one that filled in a lot of plot holes.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I felt the book was VERY SLOW. Once it picked up (at 53%), I at least finished the book just to see how it ended.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These headphones are fairly well reviewed in many audio websites and in this forum, so I'll try to keep this brief and just rate their various qualities (as I see them) on a scale of 1-10:<br /><br />Aesthetics: (2/10) The headphones look very good but Superlux gets only two points from me here  - simply because, aesthetically, the HD681 are less refined AKG (K-240) clones, though the red accents are a nice touch. Cable is one sided but unlike the K240/K240MKII the cable is hard-wired (not detachable).<br /><br />Packaging: (5/10) The headphones are packaged around a piece of cardboard and wrapped in a plastic wrapper. Not that you'd expect more at their price point but the way they sit in that piece of cardboard makes the cardboard dig into the ear-pads. The indentations left in the ear-pads do begin to fade in time.<br /><br />Built Quality: (7/10) The HD681 are made of plastic and feature vinyl ear-pads and a metal-wire bridge. The self-adjusting support head-band is also made of some type of vinyl. Overall they feel quite sturdy, the cable is fairly long (about 8ft) and is terminated with a small 1/8in jack. A screw-on 1/4in jack is included. Both jacks are gold-plated. Also supplied is a carrying bag.<br /><br />Comfort: (6/10) The ear-pads are somewhat on the small size (although they do go around the ears) but they are pretty stiff and they do cause (at least to me) some discomfort. In addition the vinyl makes them get hot even when worn for short periods of time. The HD-681 are very light weight and the self-adjusting head-band works well. Felt/Velour replacement pads from some AKG (and Beyerdynamic) models should work for HD681 but they will likely be more expensive than the headphones.<br /><br />Sound Quality: (7/10) The HD681 use unexpectedly large drivers (50mm) for their price point. Out of the box the sound is very bright (despite having a lot of bass) and a little rough around the edges. After about 20hrs (although not quite fully broken-in) their true sound signature begins to emerge: dynamic, fairly clear (still slightly veiled in the mid range) with vivid highs and a remarkable amount of bass for a semi-open design. The highs texture is fairly soft (not rough or grainy) but they are emphasized excessively (in the 8-12kHz range), so some type of equalization is necessary there. Frankly I find the bass to be too much as well but some people may find that desirable. Also, the bass is not surprising only in quantity but in quality as well as it has a solid feel and is well controlled (even when used with a relatively high output-impedance headphone-amp such as my 5ohm Matrix M-Stage - not the best amp choice for 32ohm headphones). Initially I thought there were some distortions in the lower-mids (depending on the source material) but on repeat listening they seem to be largely gone now. Also, the mid range seems to have gained in heft when compared to the highs and the initial cloudiness has lifted for the most part. I'm assuming they will mellow out some more with prolonged use although it is likely they will remain fairly bright. Overall, for sound quality I'd break things down like this:<br /><br />Bass Extension: 6/10<br />Bass Impact: 7.5/10<br />Bass Texture: 7/10 (solid)<br />Mids Quality: 6/10<br />Highs Extension: 8/10<br />Highs Quality: 7/10 (vivid)<br />Highs Texture: 6/10 (fairly soft)<br />Detail/Transparency: 6/10 (neutral/clear)<br />Dynamics: 8/10 (natural)<br />Soundstage: 6.5/10<br />Imaging: 6.5/10<br /><br />Other:<br />Isolation: 4/10 (semi-open design)<br />Portability: 3/10 (large size)<br />Improvement w/ Amplification: 4.5/10  (Note: It can be easily driven by portable devices to fairly loud levels.)<br />Value: (10/10)<br /><br />All-in-all, an interesting offering from Superlux (a manufacturer of pro-audio gear): they are not quite balanced/neutral enough to be proper studio-monitors but not quite aimed at the audiophile crowd either (more like straddling the fence). My take: for themoney (less than $30 shipped), you'd be hard pressed (really hard) to do better. Five star.<br /><br />UPDATE 07/12/2013: (Ear-pad Replacement with AKG-K240 Pads)<br />Much as I like the sound of these headphones (second only to my newly acquired Beyerdynamic DT990-Pro headphones) the discomfort due to their ear-pads being somewhat on the small side for my ears, have led me to the decision to replace the pads with those for the AKG-240 (I've also tried the Beyerdynamic EDT990-VB, velour pads, but these do not fit these headphones). The AKG pads are the same size overall, but the pad \\"doughnut,\\" so to call it, is a little thinner than that on the original Superlux pads and, as a result, the inner opening is larger at 60mm (rather than the approximately 54mm on the original HD681 pads). The new pads fit my ears much better, since now my ears can actually fit inside the pad completely and there are no more uncomfortable pressure points on my ear-lobes. Otherwise, the AKG pads could get just as hot (with prolonged use) as the original HD681 pads (they are made from the same material: leatherette). From this point of view the Beyerdynamic headphones are much better since their velour pads do allow some air flow. One more note: the new AKG-240 pads are available here on Amazon (for about $32) but I sourced them from Sweetwater (for a more reasonable $20 shipped). With these pads, these headphones are now about $50  - but either way, they still are a smoking deal!<br /><br />SQ: The sound quality remains largely the same as with the original pads save for a bit more bass impact. The original pads did provide very good low end on these headphones but with these new pads my ears are slightly closer to the driver, and perhaps that (closer acoustic coupling) may account for the perceived tightening/improvement of the bass response. The new pads don't seem to tame the highs more than the original pads, so some EQ is still necessary there, though with continued use (I have now more than 120-140 hrs on these cans) the high end has mellowed somewhat. To conclude, the replacement of the stock ear-pads on these headphones with AKG-K240 pads was (to me) well worth the added expense (which nearly doubled the cost of the headphone).money (less than $30 shipped), you'd be hard pressed (really hard) to do better.

B005PK1G76|4.0|Very easy to use. Very practical and what I love most about it is that it folds with the stroller, so I don't have to remove it every time I need to fold the stroller.
034580404X|5.0|A must read!!! Amazing doesn't even begin to describe this trilogy!!! I read them once and I am reading them again!! Can't wait for the movie!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is a lot beget that the first one and brave. this hale is great for kids and people of all ages.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|Overly simplistic writing and very repetitive. I understand its in the form of a journal by someone mentally ill, but it was just so &#34;blah&#34; for 90% of the book. The last handful of chapters were the most interesting.
B00466HM28|4.0|Great keyboard. Fun to play around with and work with. A good add to the at home and on the go musician.
B008476HBM|4.0|This book is a must read for all those who truly love the English language. The story holds the same messages now as it did  200 years ago.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|When I use this to do my homework it makes it easy and fast even though it is not a college calculator.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I love this app but when my dad joined and I clicked play. The screen goes blank. Fix this please
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book! This book was one of the best books I've read in awhile. I love have the title is tied in with the book, such a great twist!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I saw this book advertised and was instantly wanting to read it. But now that I've finished it, all I want to do is read it over and over again! Every word I read made my heart race and  my mind spinning out of control wanting to keep reading. Beautiful Disaster may be the best book I've ever read. It keeps you turning the page with each breath taking event, making you feel as if you were right there experiencing everything for yourself. Beautiful Disaster is a novel you never want to end and will be sad for finishing it.
B006O6FK2W|3.0|It's cool to look at in the beginning. The son had issues loading the batman correctly so that sucked the fun out pretty quick. A month after Christmas he doesn't touch it at all.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|i chose this rating because, i could not find it afeter i paid for it, not worth the money do not buy
B0035G9ABG|5.0|I've read articles and quotes from Damon & Jaime that they've lost interest in continuing with the Gorillaz project and if you listen to the Gorillaz Discography start to finish, you might be on their side about this by the time you finish Plastic Beach.  I'd have to say that the most unattractive thing about this album is the website tie ins they ran during Plastic Beach's release.  The fact that I'd have to &#34;subscribe&#34; to the special section of your website when you're already making PLENTY of $$ off album sales, touring, and promotion seems a little greedy.  Instead of doing so and getting &#34;The Fall&#34; for free, I just bought it.<br />I do hope we hear more from Gorillaz because I think there is some as yet un-paired talent out there I'd like to see them work with.  I just think we might need some time to let them begin to slip into the horizon so when they hit us with their glory again my mind will have stopped chanting &#34;pirate jet, pirate jet, pirate jet, pirate jet&#34; by then
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love it who ever made it rocks like me anyways it is my favorite game on my kindle fire
0981951252|5.0|I wanted to better reinforce the concepts of the paper book so I bought the audio which is also super.  Get them and apply them and change your life.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book sucks. Well I don't even get the meeting of it it really does stink.....a lot.....do not read this book.....
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was really good and I really love it. This book as all about love and I love love if u get what I'm saying :) I hope they make a continued version of this book :D
B005UG542S|1.0|Amazon has  \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1,\\" but neglects to give us part two.  This is absurd!  Why dangle this in front of us, without giving us access to the entire thing?  Shame on you, Amazon.  At least you could have posted a reason for your perfidy.
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|I had this album many years ago, and it's nice to have it in my collection<br />again, A real rush
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This true account by one of the SEALs who was on the raid that ended up with the execution of Osama bin Laden is a solid read, like one of those airport paperbacks -- only real.<br /><br />Told as a &#34;time in the service&#34; memoir, &#34;Mark Owens&#34; explains how he eventually ended up in SEAL Team 6 and some of the other missions he participated in prior to going on the mission that was chronicled visual in ZERO DARK THIRTY.<br /><br />Not many &#34;secrets&#34; are divulged in this, but the rules of engagement and the actual storytelling of the missions in Afghanistan and Iraq are fun reads, and the final chapters about the raid of the compound in Abbottobad, Pakistan is intense, detailed and emotional.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|Do you want to understand how your kids will develop a better future for our world? Read this book right now!
0670022411|5.0|I am so pleased that this novel is Book One of a trilogy. Book Two was published in 2002!<br /><br />Deborah Harkness is a professor of History perhaps, just perhaps, she has found many truths in her studies of &#34;the Scientific Revolution&#34;.<br /><br />I love a well-written mystery with romance, family dynamics and political intrigue.  There it is: &#34;a Discovery of Witches&#34;.<br /><br />I am so glad one of our readers chose it for our group!
B000002JSH|3.0|It wasnt a great one, but a good one. I didnt like bad company as much as a lot of people did. They were not the best rock band of the times. That would be Skynrd.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have tried several other weather apps and most are ok but of all I like this one the best.
B0000029AL|5.0|I saw them at moody in smu and they rocked for 3 straight hours while i stood in front of the stage drinking and holding it at the same time. It was a rough night, but they p[;ayed the whole album without a break.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I am a Peter Robinson fan, and looking for another absorbing mystery to pass the time. .&#34;Standing in Another Man's Grave&#34;<br />is well worth reading,  set in Edinburgh, Scotland. the descriptive passages of the locality were of interest.  This was my first &#34;Inspector Rebus&#34; novel.  and I will be looking for more.
B000005B0U|4.0|The only place you can get some of these songs is right here. The best blues traveler hit that you cant get anywhere else is on here.
B001CEE1YE|3.0|This set comes with many commentary tracks, including a philosophers' track featuring Cornell West.  Worth the price just for that one track!  Seriously!  Provided me with a whole new appreciation of the movies, especially as they seemed to drop in good/bad \\"Manichean\\" action toward the end of the series.  You must listen to this commentary.  -1 star for one broken case.  Will try to return.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />not sold by Amazon, so my only recourse to handle the broken case is return the whole shebang for a refund.  Removing a second star for this.  So, to sum up: Matrix Trilogy Blu-ray 5 stars, Amazon/Region Free DVD customer service, 3 stars, dragging the whole thing down.  Boo.
B00000GAIW|5.0|What can you say about tull, he was super cool in concert and aqualung was the best there ever was. He actually hung out with led zeppelin all the time.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|It's still an engaging little time-waster, highly polished, with enough new stuff to keep me entertained.  Works great on the FireHD, and looks killer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season, the writer has dared to take us where very few writers dare to go. It could potentially make or break the series, but I would say that it will continue to keep viewers on the edge of their seats for Season 4.<br /><br />This is a touching, heart-filled season, and in my opinion, the best yet.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|i am hooked on american horror story.. i cant wait til season 3.i love the change the story every season format
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You felt like you were experiencing their same emotions. Family, love, torment and action. Theirs was a story of overcoming personal tragedy and finding new life together.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My kids wanted to watch this movie over and over again! I didn't mind watching it myself. I can't tolerate some of the movies they want to watch but this one is great and family-friendly.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I love the music of Abba , I was worried that  not having Abba sing the songs would not sound right.  Was I wrong  . I  loved this movie totally..
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I never thought I would see the day when I would NOT give a Josh Groban album 5 stars. I am SO disappointed that this one is so poor.<br /><br />David Foster must have been doing SOMETHING right because this album without him is NOT good. The song selections are annoying and very ordinary for a man whose voice normally soars and moves me greatly. I would rather listen to the old albums over and over than listen to this one again. In fact, I don't know if I will listen to it more than once. It will be a shame and, to me, a tragedy if this is the direction Josh takes from now on. The songs sound superficially like Josh's style, but the magic just isn't there on this album.<br /><br />I hope the next album will be more like Josh's first three albums. I have listened to them many times and still stop and listen in awe at Josh's uniquely beautiful voice. With this album, I just kept hoping for one good song.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I purchased the movie, loved the music and the acting so much, that I bought the soundtrack, the movie and music was very uplifting
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once again England is showing &#34;The colonies&#34; how to do it right.<br /><br />Excellent story, well scripted, with excellent dialog that makes you believe you are watching daily life at this point in time.<br /><br />Well Done!
B000FCKRDI|5.0|I love this one I like the others series but wow . He one naughty lord hehe. She so shy and pretty girl and small he so big and tough and handsome I love how he teasing her and how she gives it right back at him.<br /><br />Thanks for writing these books your my favorite writer Mrs. Lisa Kleypas your wonderful. I love the wallflower Christmas one to great job also the all the hatchways series to great books
B009K72G8I|5.0|I think they are awesome. This season I look forward to finishing. I really like how it all just doesn't focus on Anakin Skywalker, and how it all adds the the Star Wars world that has been crated for our enjoyment.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|One of the funniest characters in current fiction.  The Panther moves right along with lots of action, twists and turns.
B0002HZ18C|5.0|i enjoyed the assembly.  For someone re-starting their modeling hobby, this is good starter stuff.  quality materials, excellent directions.  highly recommended.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It has a little bit of gliches but it is so fun, it has been working just fine for the last cupple day.<br />thank you for reading
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|IT wasn't so thrilling like The first one. At The beginning i could Say it was VERY repetitive. But IT's always good to decide IT by yourself
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I used to play the demo of this game a few years back on my Wii and really enjoyed it. During Christmas of 2012 I got a Kindle Fire HD and was excited; I became even more jubilant when I found the &quot;free app of the day&quot; tab, and right before my very eyes was &quot;World Of Goo&quot; FOR FREEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That made my day.
B0000029DD|4.0|I got this album primarily for L. Cohen's Hallelujah, one of my favorite songs. Buckley has an incredible voice, and I think I will listen to this album a lot.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Enjoyed it so far. Very realistic.  Glitches sometimes on my kindle fire. Otherwise great game. Would recommend to any horse lover.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|simple and fun with nice physics.  Not sure why people are giving this a 1 rating.  While the game is pretty short, it's quite entertaining while you're playing it.
1449415881|5.0|Whenever I have a bad day at work, I turn to my calendar and get a great laugh!  I buy one every year.
B004QIG7CW|4.0|Pretty cute movie about friendship but my daughter's favorite part of this movie are the songs. She has them on her iPod. Since it's Disney, the movie and songs are clean so no complaints here.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|I picked this up expecting a standard majhong game, which it definitely was not. When I saw the levels, I expected them to just be various starting iterations of the game, which disappointed me slightly that it didn't have a good randomizer in it. Once I picked a level, however, I saw that it was a cube of tiles that I needed to match, and that each progressive level was an additional cube added to the mix.<br /><br />Maybe I'm a traditionalist, but I was a little disappointed with this. It does mean, however, that it is a good game for when you only have a brief period of time to play rather than the full amount of time a true game would require.<br /><br />My only complaint about game play is that moving around the cubes was a little more challenging than it should be.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 6 year old loves playing this game and I also catch myself playing it as well. Only downside is it is very hard to get the gems. Other than that, great game.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I don't remember ever playing with these characters as a kid, but when I discovered them as an adult, I was very taken. Getting the mice through the mazes and into the rocket has proven to be a real challenging brain-teaser, and I've spent many hours of enjoyment on it.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Great product arrived in perfect condition. I'm a transformer fan so I had to have this box set. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Multiple discs in multiple seasons skip terribly. It's so frustrating to have to take the disc out or try to fast forward through the malfunction. Not worth buying.
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|It was a real nail biter, but grusome..not something you want to watch when you are home alone. I would not recommend it<br />to most people.
B0082XJGRK|5.0|Very interesting, often very exemplary, journals of a well-educated man who tried to live up to his teachers, parents, and mentors in life.  He writes of how he himself should live.  It isn't so much a memoir, but a journal helping him to remember how he was taught, and how to apply that to his life at the moment.  He leaned toward philosophy.  Did his best to treat people well.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|It was Okay. but I was disappointed . These are two of my favorite actors and for some reason i expected it to<br />be funnier...
0803729227|5.0|Beautiful story about discovering the world outside your surroundings. It invites curiosity for little children. My daughter was 3 when I started to read this book. She always loved to hear me reading this book. She's now 6 years old and can read it her own
B00577WFFE|5.0|I first heard Imelda May on the PBS special honoring Les Paul, featuring Jeff Beck on guitar. Beyond that I hadn't heard any of her earlier work, but &#34;More Mayhem&#34; is exquisite. She does a great job of straddling old school jazz and rockabilly, adding just enough punk edge to sound contemporary, but stops well short of diving head first in to the &#34;thrash can&#34;. She also serves up a bit of Celtic flair (&#34;Kentish Town Waltz&#34;) and Country (&#34;Gypsy&#34;, and a nice cover of Patsy Cline's &#34;Walking After Midnight&#34;), but my favorites are originals like &#34;Proud and Humble&#34;, &#34;Inside OUt&#34;, and and &#34;Johnny Got A Boom Boom&#34; (a dog house bass~~not a gun). Plenty of suburb pickin' all over the recording as well.  Can't wait for more!
0345803507|5.0|Ana and Christian are some of my favorite characters.  This book brought my love for reading back!  Can't wait for the movies!!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The first in the series and the first Jack Reacher novel I read.  It is enjoyable enough to read, rather like mind candy.  The author tries for some plot twists but they are just curves in the road.  I will read another &#34;Reacher&#34; novel.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I really enjoyed this series, I'm in to WWII history so this was great for me and there were some hotties in it too :)
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Loved it because it is one of those movies that shows you that there is love everywhere ;-). I strongly recommend it.
0345803485|5.0|Ana and Christian are some of my favorite characters.  This book brought my love for reading back!  Can't wait for the movies!!
B00ATPVA78|4.0|This is another good story\puzzle from G5.  I think I've graduated from the free G5 games and it's time to purchase a full game.

B0026PA05M|4.0|Halestorm (no spell check that isn't a typo!)  rules.  I would say Joan Jet crossed with steam punk would be the best description.  So for me AWESOME.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Most young adults today are traveling in the fast lanes of life, this movie you need to slow down and see the birth of sience fiction films .From movies like this animators learned newer and better things. You should appreciate this.This movie was well made had a wonderfull story line.You didnt go into it to learn ANYTHING  but to be intertained. HD video wasnt bad.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|All my girls like this game (ages 3, 5 and 8.)  Would give it the same stars even if it wasn't free.  I actually tried to find an extended version of this game to buy, since my girls like it so much, but apparently they don't have one.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|White Noise is a great sound app that let's you listen to white noise and many other colors! I didn't even know violet noise existed! There's so many options. You can also go online and  more sounds. New ones are added all the time! This has quickly become my favorite noise app. The detail that each sound goes into is also pretty amazing! The rain options alone range from light to have rain, rain on a run roof, thunderstorms, etc.. Definitely a must have!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|For persons familiar with multi-platinum vocalist Josh Groban it's understandable why his sixth studio album All That Echoes has made its debut at #1 on Amazon's Best Sellers list. In addition to the top position on the Best Seller list, All That Echoes currently holds the #1 position of the Pop, Vocal Pop, Rock, and Classical categories, all of which are much deserved.<br /><br />The singer, songwriter and record producer is famous for his amazing talents as a vocalist as everyone knows. This time Josh Groban proves the merits of his superstar status yet again by the creation of an incredibly beautiful vocal with instrumentals release like no other.<br /><br />All That Echoes is the follow-up to an equally wondrous album Illumination from 2010, yet Josh Groban test his talents as a songwriter having written seven of the twelve songs on his 2013 release. The five popular cover songs likewise are wonderful versions with verses sung of the highest quality so expect nothing less than the best.<br /><br />All That Echoes is listed in the Pop genre category at Amazon, but music crossing into multiple genres is more than commonplace. After listening to the entire album for this review it sounds primarily an easy listening vocal album but this naturally has little to do with how this album is perceived artistically.<br /><br />Nearly all of the first customer reviews at Amazon have given this the uppermost rating, of which I couldn't agree more. Resonating with fans from all corners of the globe, I believe you will find All That Echoes is a stunning new release that rings true from the first note to the last.<br /><br />Original review from NewAgeMusicWorld.com.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is one of those movies which at 2 hours and 44 minutes long you really feel like you get the most out of your money. The great thing about it though is that the movie is amazing as well.
B005PW3OS8|3.0|The movie was good but it was too expensive.  If I remember, I rented this and I won't do it again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I just added this app to my new Kindle Fire and really haven't had a chance to check it out but appears to be as good as most weather apps are.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was another of many good books by Nicholas Sparks. He did an adequate job of portraying domestic violence and letting you into the mind of the abuser and the abused. The story line is very good in that it gives you a good study of lives in conflict and resolution. There were a few quirks such as the ages of the children compared to their abilities. It seemed like they were awfully advanced for their ages. All in all a good read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome love this app very fun and realistic fun to compete everyone should get this awesome app fun to take care of
013168728X|2.0|tl;dr: I found the book was confusing, convoluted, and generally useless. Rambling review follows.<br /><br />I got this book for a digital image processing course (cse 166 at UCSD with Serge Belongie.) The course (especially the lectures) was really good, unfortunately the book didn't measure up.<br /><br />I generally find that computer science/programming (or college) books in general fall into two categories:<br /><br />1) Easy to read and understand, but still leaving a question as to how I would implement something. These books are generally things that are there to provoke insight in the reader without giving them all the answers. They serve to lay out a general road to follow where the reader has to think and discover for themselves.<br /><br />I'd consider books like Programming Pearls, Fowler's Refactoring, Gang of Four's Design Patterns, etc. to be in this category.<br /><br />2) Hard to read, understand, and generally useless. I consider the reviewed textbook to be one of these. I found that the book was hard to understand even after having attended lecture and done the homework. Hell, I got an A in the class and if I were to go back and read the book, it probably would still be very confusing.<br /><br />I feel the biggest issue is how the authors chose to approach the examples. Their explanations of how they solved the examples was confusing and skipped a lot of steps. Even more frustrating is how simple the examples could be in comparison to the homework problems. The book, however, was useful for seeing alternate implementations/algorithms for a task.<br /><br />I don't regret having bought the book or done the reading, as confusing as it was. Perhaps it was helpful getting an alternate description, but it certainly didn't feel that way. I don't think this book would be useful on its own, unless one happens to be really good at using these types of books.<br /><br />ps:<br /><br />Note, this is simply my (simple and unrefined) opinion on computer science/programming books. Not some grand theory.<br /><br />Sorry for the vagueness, but its hard to pin down exactly what I found to be unsatisfactory about the book. Hopefully some of it managed to show through.
0062107062|5.0|What a hero we will miss. Please don't miss out on an opportunity to give back to some of those who have given their all for us.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can I say, she is the queen of contemporary music.  Actually, we bought this album for friends in Istanbul.  Adele is a superstar worldwide.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Excellent book kate morton writes very nice stories i also read the sectet gardan the best. You cant jeep reading is one of the best books
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was immediately drawn into this beautifully crafted story about the constancy of love--even in the face of life's many uncertainties. It's a story of intrigue and redemption; you will love the heroine!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I feel like this is definitely more of a young adult book for someone in high school, but at the same time I think anyone could take something from it.  I highlighted more throughout this book than any other book in my life...it's the freshman year of high school of an outsider boy that made some friends and began to find himself, find peace in past issues and be happy with the way things are.  Highly recommended!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A definit must have 5 stars fans of temple run will enjoy this addicting temple run like game they will play it over and over again
1936608898|5.0|After being Paleo for over a year and just winging it I was doing OK but not great. It Starts With Food is just what I needed to get my head on straight and understand the hows and whys in regards to what our brains and bodies do with the food we eat! Sure if you're a nutritionist or a Dr. you know these things. But if you're just a suburbanite with a crazy hectic life you really don't take the time to understand it all. The Hartwigs relayed a lot of great information that made sense to me. They took the science and put it into terms that related to me. I now have a better understanding how processed foods not only affect how the brain reacts but the WHOLE body. It's a vicious cycle I have lived in for pretty much my whole life. Now that I &#34;get&#34; it and I've learned to eat meals in a more healthy mind set I've been feeling great. No more brain fog, no more achy joints and no more headaches! Read this book. Do the Whole30. Change your life!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|One of my favorites. Watch it over and over again. Better than Gwyneth's version, in my humble opinion. Well done BBC.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is pretty great, it's fun..I dint think it was going to be that fun but I was proved wrong..my only complaint is that it's so hard to get gem points but other than that it's something I recommend
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome very similar to temple run graphics are great and the challenges are interesting the developers also did a great job of integrating multiple character
B00AKCJB44|5.0|I strongly believe this album has a great mixture of music that not only fits the movie well, but is also great in itself. I don't normally listen to what some may consider \\"hardcore\\" rap, but something about the way it all ties together has me listening to it again and again. Plenty of great artists on here, all great music.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm surprised that this was free really nice graphics its almost like really owning a horse. Great game free so if you don't like it then just u install it.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Research any topic in behavioral economics and psychology, and it is evident that Kahneman is a pioneer and the foremost expert in the field. With every concept he presents in the book, he also actively questions the reader and subsequently proves his points by the answers he evokes from you. It is a truly engaging process.<br /><br />Kahneman also gives praise to others in the field, and creates useful links between his theories and the work of his contemporaries that give the reader a richer understanding of these intertwining fields of study.<br /><br />The lessons in this book should be applied to countless areas of daily life, including: marriage, budgeting, investment, time management, memory, happiness, voting, predictions, risk, storytelling, and impressions of reality.<br /><br />100% worth it.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|the game is not what i expected. the visuals are some what blurry and it is extremely slow.  not good for my expectation
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is amazing and i got addicted very quick 5 star probably the best free app i have ever played graphics are good as well buy now
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Totally loved this book and the story line. Very Fifty Shades only better. I cannot wait to read the next ion the series when it is finally in print.
B0041D843M|5.0|This will change your life for better and ever. You must read it and have your family and friends read it. You have nothing to loose and so much to gain
B0006399FS|5.0|I knew this album for a long time and a long time ago it was in my collection earlier. I am glad I could buy it again for such a low amount.
0425252868|5.0|A superb book, providing unusual insight into the WWII aerial war in Europe. It provides a fair comparison of U.S. and German airmen, showing that in the end we are all brothers forced into combat by political forces beyond our control. I highly recommend it, especially to those who remember those dark days of the early 1940s and others with an interest in military aircraft and history. It points out clearly that many Germans (perhaps even a majority) were led and forced against their will by abominable individuals like Hitler and Goering who ruled with vicious cruelty.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Fulfilled my expectations. Now I can organize my files on my Kindle Fire.  I recommend this product to Kindle Fire owners.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|I liked it . ..  Of course I liked Pulp Fiction and Thursday (favorite--by Skip Woods), so this was right up my proverbial alley.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved it! A very well written story. Highly recommend reading before you watch the movie. Easier to understand when you've read the book.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Great movie. Saw it on 60 minutes first, but the documentary was much better than the blurb on 60 minutes. Fascinating story.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun as well as addicting. On top of all that its free and doesn't pressure you into buying coins like others games do.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I LOVE this man's voice and expression...he can do no wrong.  I first saw him on Ally McBeal and was blown away.  i own 4 of his CD's.  Highly recommend!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I love this series it makes me just wanting to keep reading and if you like realistic fiction books you will love this one.
0618918248|5.0|Say what you will about Dawkins, but he has a way with words when it comes to writing about religion.  I've read this a couple times now, in addition to listening to the book on tape.  It really helps put into words what I find so frustrating about most religions.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game it's so addicting and so much fun. The only thing is .that it is really hard to get enough money to by different characters. Their really  expensive.
1400069289|2.0|I'm probably in the minority of reviewers who were not impressed by this book.  I actually read this book before reading some of the glowing Amazon reviews that this book had received.  I thought somehow after reading this I would be able to have a new perspective on life and would learn the impacts habits (good or bad) would have on me.  All I can say is that in my experience, this book dragged on much longer than it needed to and did not impact me at all.  The book got off to an interesting start, explaining the basics of a habit (cue, routine, reward) and explaining how to change the habit (you change the routine).  However, midway through the book and toward the end, the book went into \\"corporate habits\\" and societal habits and although I read it, I found it dull and was basically forcing myself to finish the book.  I guess I should have figured it out from the title of the book - which is \\"Why We Do What We Do\\"...not \\"How to Change What We Do\\".
0374533571|2.0|A friend suggested the book after my rave reviews about the film.<br /><br />The book has a great story that's quite a bit different from the film. I liked the story, but wish I'd wrote it instead of the author. He is not a good writer and what miracle caused the success of his book?<br /><br />I'd like to know.<br /><br />David Russell gets my respect for transforming a weak book into a great and moving film, but that's a different review.<br /><br />Puzzling and Weak:<br /><br />Pat: He is a retarded manchild in the book, who narrates the story. He calls the mental hospital he was recently released from \\"the bad place\\", believes his mom when she says all the pictures of his wife he obsesses over were stolen, he can't remember historical figures, and several years are missing from his mind, yet he is a college educated teacher.<br /><br />It seems more like he has brain damage than a mental problem. There's suggestion in the book that may be the case, but a very weak one. Also, he describes being in the hospital with other people who have head injuries and nothing else, so it does not seem to be a mental hospital.<br /><br />Head injuries are associated with behavioral outbursts, which the character is noted for, but who knows what the author means?<br /><br />Tiffany: She is the love interest in the story. She has almost no dialogue and is kind of a misogynistic character.<br /><br />She's a \\"beautiful girl\\" in love with a retard for no real reason, and it's all unlikely male fantasy. Females who are extremely pretty and exist just to facilitate the male are objects, especially when written by a male.<br /><br />In this case, I doubt the author can even imagine a conversation with such a woman, since he did not imagine it on paper.<br /><br />Danny: Is a friend of Pat's. He's a \\"magical negro\\" (look it up) in the book. He's sort of that in the movie, but in the book he literally shows up under magical circumstances. He's got weird wisdom/help yet is brain damaged,etc.<br /><br />This is another prejudiced character famous of white authors.<br /><br />Strong:<br /><br />Once I accepted that Pat is retarded I felt bad about his wife obsession. He was obsessed with physical fitness because of massive perfectionism and poor communication skills. He is living at home and completely unable to deal with his parents. He does not love Tiffany and is simply overwhelmed by her and can't contribute. Tiffany has no character, beyond what you imagine, and she's a weirdly tragic figure for being in love with Pat.<br /><br />I got tears in my eyes reading about Pat's longing for all kinds of things that just won't happen, but overall, the novel was bizarre, like someone drunk wrote it. I didn't hate it, due to the story and sympathy for the futility of Pat's life, but wish a writer had written it.<br /><br />How did it get published?
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|it was really fun but not like super Mario bros. I still really liked it though just different character would make it way better
B005TZFZ9W|1.0|From the off start, there's no real reason to review such an awful rapper such as this because personally there's no point these are your kind of mindless so called artists for mindless people who think their cool because they listen to vacuous empty music that should be abolished the case here is that this awful rapper doesn't exude any real talent at all that it takes to compete in the real world of hip-hop or much less knows what it is like the rest of the mindless aberrations that consume this stuff - it's best left to avoid and invest in a real hip-hop cd.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I don't understand what the fuss is all about. Probably because for many people is the first book of erotica they read? I don't know. No plot whatsoever. Only sex and even that gets boring after a few pages.
B005K17RU0|3.0|The visuals on this app are nice and the information about the current weather is right there and easy to read.  But it seems to have a lot of details about humidity, UV indexes, etc and I haven't been able to find a spot where it would tell me how much snow we are supposed to get when I see snowflakes.  It would be nice if you could select which weather information you want to see or perhaps switch out some of the detail for more basic weather information.  It would also be nice if you could get to a radar image.  If any of these features are in the app, I haven't found them yet.

B008JGSM6G|2.0|This is a decent puzzle app, and my young kids actually LOVE playing it. However, since I do have young kids playing games on my Kindle Fire, I also have a Parental Control password set up so that no in-app purchases can be made.<br /><br />This app overrides the Parental Controls, so that any hints (.99 per set of 5) and other in-app items (up to 2.99) are available for purchase without having to enter the confirmation password. I tried multiple ways to remove the purchasing option, but there is simply no way to set these controls. As a result, I had to remove the app. It's a shame, because otherwise it's a cool game, and a good logical challenge. Paying $28.00 in 18 hours because my 5-year old didn't realize the hints he was requesting was costing Mommy real money? Not worth the download, even for a free app.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is the best game ever it should be rated the # 1 game of 2013 it is fun and exciting to play but is also chalanging to play when every one is snatching you.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I purchased this book for my 7th grade daugther to do a book report on and I ended up reading it too.  It was so good and I used it as a teaching tool with my daugther about the cause and effect of bullying and the consequences that may come with it.  Was very moving, I told her teacher I thought all middle school kids should have to read it.  I can see the story happening in every day life so easy these days.  Very sad but true.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Still didn't figure out if the kid on the train was him & if it was that meant he slept with his mother?  Any movie with Bruce Willis is good for me.

B004XGN8W4|4.0|Well worth the 220. The only problem i have with it is there's not enough room to plug the cables into your system/monitor. without bending them. i had to stick something under my system to prop it up to plug cables in without bending them.
B008OOYALE|2.0|this could be a great app, but it isn't.  the cool features aren't available for kindle fire users, which means I have an unhappy kid because she can't get all the dragons. fix that and I might change my mind.
B0027UY8B8|5.0|Everything in order and easy to follow. Nice booklet. Great set for an epic scifi series. No problem with discs or their usage.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Excellent show. American producers need to take notes. Its not all about Guns,violence and scantily clad girls. Every commercial for a TV show during the Superbowl was same old junk.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this game!!!<br />It doesn't matter what Angry Birds game it is, I love to play them ALL!!!<br />No Matter what Season or version it is I ENJOY PLAYING IT!!!

0316067598|5.0|One of the best, first-hand account that I've read.  The story is just amazing from start to finish.  It's truly an awesome display of action, brotherly love, never give up attitude and display of the mental capabilities of our American Warriors!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|As always Larsson makes the book easy to read even with the numerous characters we need to become familiar with. Slower pace than the first time two books but still solid.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Not a bad movie. Not as action packed as I would have thought. The ending was good but left a lot of questions.  I probably wont watch again
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly, the complete series was bought as a gift. Along with Serenity, it complements the entire series. Every Browncoat should own the set.
B001EBWING|5.0|Beautiful movie. Everyone should see this movie, not because it is required but because it is an entertaining movie that has timeless themes of love and nobility.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Serenity Movie (Blu-Ray) was purchased as a gift. Bought based on the original DVD version. A must have for any Browncoat.

B00000IFP6|5.0|I bought this during a period of little money, when I had to consider the price of my CD purchases. This version was the cheapest I could find of the Beethoven symphonies, and I had liked I heard of Zinman's other conducting, so I bought it. I expected the usual situation with bargain-priced collections: indifferent performances and terrible sound. What a surprise, then, to hear this set! The sound is terrific--full, clean, balanced, and dynamic, with a beautiful tonality. Really, it competes with anything I own (I've got more than 6,000 CDs and LPs) and beats most of it.<br /><br /> In terms of the performance, the Tonalle orchestra is just as good as the sound--extremely coherent ensemble playing, finely balanced timing, complete command of dynamics, and very much at home with this material. Everything else is just a matter of taste and preference. Whether this is a good interpretation or a bad one is a personal judgement, despite the very absolute judgements that reviewers offer. I happen to find Zinman's approach and tempos on the ninth to be absolutely in line with what's written and the sensibility I associate with Beethoven as a man. But you might have a different opinion. I might have wished for just a bit more punch on the downbeats in the Molto Vivace, but that's my taste in general--I like dynamic emphasis--really, though, that's just the kind of thing that one listener favors over another. And that's really the beauty of what's on offer here: for a very modest price you can own a set of recordings that is completely respectable and have enough money left over to buy another interpretation to compare.

1455519650|1.0|First I want to say I have DEVOURED previous Bosch books, and never been disappointed.  However, this particular one was a real chore, and I gave up after 1/3 into it.  Boring/tedious, hard to follow, cared nothing about any of the characters, plot (what there was of it) was uninteresting, just absolutely nothing to hold on to.  I am amazed by the 5-4 star reviews!<br />I dropped it and picked up another Bosch book - \\"City of Bones\\" -  which is great.  I was never disapppointed before in Bosch books, but guess there's a first time for everything.
0439023491|5.0|bought the book for my sister. they heard about the book before the movie came out. they like the book than the movie

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is so dynamic, and Maggie Smith is simply delightful. Every character is so intriguing, it is simply a show that everyone should try watching. If you're like me and love movies like 'Pride and Prejudice', than you'll love this show.
B00138J234|5.0|London Calling is a must have to any music lovers collection. Ii's calassic Style and punk Grace. While driving, playing or just lounging.
0316228532|1.0|This is definitely the worst book I have ever read (and I am a voracious reader.)  I can't believe Rowling wrote it!  Too many characters to keep track of - even by the end of the book when you should be familiar with them.  My daughter told me she even made lists to keep track of who was who!  On top of that, the story wonders aimlessly with no purpose or goal in sight.  I actually really thought, \\"Thank God I'm finally done with that one\\" when I finished it.  No redeeming value at all!
B001W2JWWC|5.0|This CD is classic music that has lasted through decades! I have enjoyed this music since high school in the seventies. Great memories associated with the tunes.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|the app does seem to be missing the ability to combine tracks on my kindle fire. ik that the iphone version allows for mixing sounds, and his version should too
B009U9S6FI|4.0|This book is often referenced and worth reading. Viktor lived a life that's difficult to imagine. His lessons are worth your attention. Here are several of his inspiring quotes:<br /><br />\\"Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'.\\"<br />\\"What is to give light must endure burning.\\"<br />\\"The last of the human freedoms is to choose one's attitudes.\\"
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was tired of the theme and wished for a happier solution to all of the drudgery and darkness of the book.
B00B2H28SM|5.0|Let me just state that I've only recently (within the past 3 years) gotten into Tegan & Sara. This basically culminated in me buying The Complete Recollection over 1 year ago, which got me completely hooked. Their style of songwriting just hits all my buttons for whatever reason.<br /><br />When I first heard they were going more poppy for their new album, to be honest, I didn't know what to expect. Then I heard Closer back in September / October and absolutely fell in love with the song. I've literally woken up to it everyday for work since then as it is my alarm.<br /><br />This album completely blew me away. It's qutie different from the rock style of Sainthood yet still has the same bittersweet lyrics.<br /><br />Most of the songs are of the heart break variety, yet are still somehow quite dance-able and have a high energy.<br /><br />I'd like to suggest you buy it if you're reading this. If not the entire thing I would suggest the following 4 songs, as they are my favorite:<br /><br />I'm Not Your Hero<br />Drove Me Wild<br />How Come You Don't Want Me<br />I Couldn't Be Your Friend
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was not as good as the first book and was a bit redundant.  It will probably make a good movie.

Link is who she should be worried about!

B00992CF6W|5.0|Well, everyone's already said it. A great app, still in development so bugs can be expected. Amazed by how smoothly it works on kindles. With so many updates expected, it's got loads of potential. Just remember that this is the real minecraft, the app store is flooded with copies and fakes.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Never disappointed!  I cannot wait for the 6th Season.  The writers have set up some very intriguing situations for it.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|Just the right combo of great songs from Zac Brown!!<br />I highly recommend the download of these songs to anyone!
0452298482|4.0|This is a very fun read.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was due to the pages being a little ragged in some areas.<br />The book itself was great.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|ok app. but it takes a long time to collect money to buy stuff. The only way to get any good items or items you need for a quest is you have to pay for them. (buy gems) .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are no words to explain how much this book has moved me, or to explain how much of a true privilege it has been to be able to know and fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus.<br /><br />Ending this book on a very emotional note.<br />A++++, Mr. Green.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Good movie. The first obscure movie of batman. It really makes more credible the hole batman story. Need to be seen in blu ray.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is the best app ever, I downloaded it to my android tablet and it's amazing it let you sample books before you buy it. You gotta try it, if you love to read like me.(Green Machine).
B0010OIN90|3.0|Nice product, easy to determine how to add and subtract links.  My only problem is that my three year old has a hard time getting it on and keeping it on as the clasp is not super tight.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a perfect sequel to the first temple run. it is a lot more of an adventure. And the scenery and paths are constantly changing and you never know when the paths are changing until you are on a new one. The cart and zip line are great additions.
B000KFB4PK|4.0|Love the lego design, links are easy to add and subtract, just not loving the clasp mechanism as it comes undone easier than I'd prefer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game dude!!!!!!!!!!!!!it I s so addicting. You r so determined to beat the next person!! Get it now don't wait another second to purchase! Beat your friends and be number 1!!!!!
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Seven Samurai(1954) is a classic of Japanese cinema. Seven samurais risk their lives to protect a farm from cold blooded,<br />starving, dangerous bandits. Everything from The Magnificent Seven(1960) to A Bug's Life(1998) is an homage to this film.<br />This is one of Akira Kurosawa best films. Seven Samurai is three hours and twenty minutes, but it's worth watching.<br />The Criterion DVD is packed with extras. We get to see clips of Japanese movies filmed in the 1920's! Seven Samurai is an avante-garde classic.
B009CG11WY|5.0|John Hughes at his best! And very relevent to kids today. My 14 yr old daughter watches it at least once a week.  &#34;Mess with the bull, you'll get the horns&#34;
0316227706|5.0|Hillarious and sometimes kinda scary! Every page is outstanding! This book is non-stop entertainment and just plain fun. If you love dogs, you'll love this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game like temple run. With the bonus of not needing to tilt the device. I thoroughly enjoy this game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator! I used to shop using my phoned calculator but its do small I often lost my totals ot hit the wrong. numbers- with the kindle its so easy to read and use!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I was looking for a replacement to the Accuweather app.  Accuweather was taking up too much memory on my phone.  I am not sure of the footprint of this application since the interface was too confusing for the small screen to be of use to me.  I removed it after about 15 minutes.  Other than that it may be good and useful to others but not me.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|This is my favorite movie, great soundtrack and the Blu-ray enhances it.  Don't hesitate to buy this dvd.  You be quite glad you did.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was the first book I read on my Kindle and I so enjoyed it.  The story was well written with good character development.  I laughed out loud a number of times. I cringed at the terrible treatment the poor children had to endure in the orphanage.  The chapters dealing with the orphanage were descriptive without being overly so.  It was a good story of a man who lived a truly \\"hard scrabble\\" life and the friends he made along the way.  If you enjoy stories about Ireland, Scotland or the British Isles, you'll enjoy this one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app provides a variety of games that many are able to enjoy. There are games that require more skills than others but they are fun!!
B004I744AS|5.0|Very helpful and quite entertaining with its daily quotes..etc....history items..horoscope..and spelling challenges.  Highly recommend it.  I use often during word games.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I enjoyed it, and it's like now we know what and why K is so attached to Will Smith. And I would watch it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very nice graphics. and the unicorns are amazing!! can be recommended to all horse lover's!! just wish you could choose your starter horse breed.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The Good Wife is a great show! I've been watching since the first episode. Plots are very well intertwined, always a surprise.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Had to order this cable plus a new plug because a plug for the wall did not come with my new Kindle=BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  All that was received with the NEW Kindle was the cord to charge from our computer's USB port which takes forever.
B00124DSR0|4.0|The digital version works just fine for me. I am pissed however because I cannot send it over to itunes. Send help. Other digital purchases went right over to itunes but not this one.
B004UIXZV4|3.0|Honestly, I can't much complain- this is a free edition of a classic text. There are some spelling and grammatical errors, but nothing too awful. Unlike some free kindle books, it is readable.
0374214913|5.0|Just finished this and since there are some very long winded reviews giving you the basics of the story I wont bother. What I would like to share is that this book was thoughtful and interesting about the book world and where it is going with all the technology now out there. I didnt find it over the top exciting but by the time I got to the middle I was hard pressed to put it down and eat a meal. This would have been great with a contiuation if it wasnt for the epilogue at the end. I could still enjoy a detailed account of everyones life after this book with a volume two. I'm no history fan but even some of the historical referances interested me and thats unusaul. Very good book for a long winter day.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|After watching this movie, &#34;Deep in an ancient Hawaiian forest&#34; by Makana stuck in my head.  I had to have this CD because not only is Makana's tune absolutely beautiful, I enjoy all of the other Hawaiian tunes as well.  Great, mello, variety for the car when travelling!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is awesome. I never ever get bored of it. There are many colors or words to choose from. I luv it you should get it

Tried to contact customer service but can't find a phone number anywhere.  This is my first and last experience with on-demand video viewing through Amazon.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is super addicting and can be played by anyone any age. You can get different characters by collecting mystery boxes and many other ways the opstacles are fun and go good with the subway feeling making it more realistic.
B005LAII0I|4.0|I was watching this movie on pay per-view one night last summer  with my grand-daughters, and thought it was kind of cute. I was taking a class on domestic abuse and the title &#34;Mirror Mirror&#34; struck me as a title to use for a paper.<br />I decide to purchase it as a tool for future use.  Thanks!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Wanted it, got it. Nice packaging Blue Ray collection is coming along nicely.  Too many words, y'all ask too much
B00101ZOTA|5.0|You really have to pay attention to this movie. At the end you'll want to rewatch it because you can't believe you missed all of the clues. One of the best crime movie I have ever seen.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very well written. I couldn't stop reading! The subject is my favorite and I heard Dr. Alexander's story first on Bio.Com: I survive beyond and back. I am on my second time around reading it.
B008MM9630|5.0|this is a fun game. you have option of buying crystals but I like that you don't have to. and can look up hints on facebook.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I really enjoy this album. Buy it. Listen to it. Feel the beat and hear the lyrics. You won't be disappointed.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Loved it: I would recommend any body that likes to listen to their music while on the go to purchase it.
B00A6PD8RQ|1.0|Film kept freezing up during the entire movie, could not exit amazon to get to any other movie, locked up many times , very poor reception
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I think Star Treks creator would be pleased with this new addition and new cast and a twist in the romance between Spock and Urhurra
B000FC10WU|5.0|Excellent story, very good character development, with a plot and time line easy to follow. And, only a reasonable use of middle English words and expressions, facilitating a good reading experience for an American reader in the 21st century.  take care
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It took me a whole to get used to it!! But it has upgraded graphics and new challenges and adventures!
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I have been heavily researching affordable automatic watches for months, and finally decided upon the Seiko 5.  I was a little worried that I might not like the size despite my rather small wrists, and was concerned that the beige face would be too bland or simple.  The second I put it on I fell in love.  I have bought several different color NATO straps to change out, but the stock strap was actually more attractive than it seemed in pictures.  Still, I prefer an olive green or bright color.<br />The quality is excellent, I love the day/date and every detail of the watch is well thought out and executed.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this watch to anyone looking to get a daily workhorse automatic.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I love this game. I like the way it plays. The are so well done. I just the idea that it is in my kindel fire.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|This is the best show I have ever seen and each season gets better and better than the last one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best ever! This is perfect for little girls and anyone else who loves horses. My only complaint is that some activities take too long.
1574216988|5.0|Heard about zentangles only a week ago, and this book is for me as well as advanced users. It's pretty and full of really good information. Kudos!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Try it. The more you play the better it gets, then buy another horse and twice the money, life sounding.
B008US4PBY|4.0|I got this product because I just recently bought a ps3 and Ive never been a fan of the dualshock controller(especially for shooters). It is unfortunate you have to buy a wireless adapter for xbox controllers even with this but they are only about 15 dollars and I already happen to have a wired controller and that works great. My only small complaint is that with a select few games(namely the uncharted series) the controller doesnt translate with forward movement. Every thing else works great but when moving straight forward the character will slow to a crawl. With that exception it has worked marvelously with everything else, including ni no kuni which is also a PS exclusive. I  have not had the chance to try it on killzone yet but it's a great product that is worth the money if you really prfer a certain controller type.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|We were glad to see such a great &quot;free&quot; game download with all the great graphics, action, and features, yes it was easy to get started and right into the fun.  What spoils it all is that right away you find the game play falling into &quot;dead ends&quot; and limitations after you spend the &quot;Gold Stars&quot; they give you up front.  You find yourself being prompted again and again to buy more of these &quot;Gold Stars&quot; for real money (not the coins, you can earn them) in order to do what you need to do in the game to build things, move forward, or win for very long. Also there seems to be no other real choice than to spend real money to move on so we got the message and just uninstalled it.  We would prefer if the developers need some money for their game creation just charge a little up front and be done with it please. As a parent we dont want to dive into endless game spends on tokens within games for any reason.  Free should really be free or its not free &hellip;
B004XCXJGI|5.0|I really like the old Negroe singers and they told it like it was, tough and bad, I dug it the most,great album!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it because I played it on my friends ipad so rock on the baby I baby sit she loves it
0345803485|1.0|Okay so even though I never wanted to set foot on this bandwagon... I caved. I figured since this book has been on the NY times bestsellers list for FORTY-EIGHT weeks, and is currently still at #5 it would be as awesome as everyone says it is. Not to mention the fact that '50 Shades of Grey' has been blowing up my Facebook news feed and several friends (who I will admit aren't the most intelligent) have recommended it to me. \\"Holy crap\\" was I WRONG. I knew I should have stopped reading around 22% when I realized the terrible writing was not improving. Actually I should have stopped reading after page 1 when Ana is \\"brushing her hair into submission and repeating the mantra, 'I must not sleep with my hair wet'. But I needed to see for myself what the hype was about and figured perhaps it was one of those books that starts off terrible and ends up amazing... or something like that. By 50% (which is probably stretching it), the only reason I wanted to finish it was so that I could justly write this review. And so it goes... (you might not want to read if you haven't read the book and still want to waste your time doing so, it as it includes spoilers)<br /><br />The first point that I would like to make is: NO WONDER WHY AMERICANS ARE THE WAY WE ARE. Seriously, garbage like this is on the bestsellers list?! We should be ashamed of ourselves. I've seen better writing displayed in the Amazon reviews for this book. Did anybody edit this book? I swear it is a rough draft that was written by a horny 15 year old. For me it was impossible to overlook the poor writing, but if somehow you are able to do that, the plot is still NONEXISTENT. And yes, I realize that the main reason people like this book is for the \\"kinky sex scenes\\". Spoiler: THEY SUCK TOO. You might as well pick up a Harlequin romance novel with a picture of Fabio and his long ass hair flowing in the wind and a naked woman curled up at his feet if you want to read about sex. Its that bad.<br /><br />Alright, so ifyou can overlook the poor writing and don't mind the boring sex, you would assume that the characters are at least really interesting with some semi-intelligent thoughts that might make you ponder. NOPE! Ana, the main character has the maturity of a 12 and a half year old girl. Supposedly she is super intelligent and reads classic novels in her spare time, yet every other thought is a either variation of \\"Holy crap\\" (including double crap, TRIPLE crap and not to mention crapola!) or Jeez! So at the beginning, Ana is about to graduate college, is a virgin, and has also never been drunk (yet less than halfway into the book she is wishing for a drink every chapter). Then she meets Christian Grey. Christian  is a self made BILLIONAIRE at the ripe old age of 26 (which is about as believable as Ana graduating college and never getting wasted). Anyway... they start to see each other and she figures out he is a stalking psychopath but she doesn't care. So Ana gives up her V-card to Christian and \\"breaks into a million pieces\\" as she has her first orgasm. From here on out she is practically able to orgasm on command. COME ON PEOPLE. They have sex about 50 times. And its not 50 shades of sex. I actually found myself skimming over some of it because it was so monotonous. In a nutshell: Christian glances at Ana, Ana bites her lip, Christian says don't bite your lip, Ana flushes, Christian tousles his hair, Ana's muscles clench 'deep down in her belly', Christian touches her 'down there', Ana  breaks into a million pieces and Christian finds his release. put that on repeat, throw in some Holy craps, Jeez's, abuse, and Twinnings English Breakfast Tea and congratulations, you've written a best selling novel!<br /><br />Another thing I would like to point out is that Ana attends school in Vancouver, Washington and works at a hardware store in Portland, Oregon. I guess maybe the author is like Ana and made it to the year 2011 without acquiring a computer to GOOGLE A FREAKING MAP ofthe Pacific NW. Jeez! And when Ana does acquire her Macbook she acts like its the craziest piece of technology she's ever known to exist and refers to it as \\"the mean machine\\".<br /><br />I'll admit that I'm hating pretty hard on the fact that I just wasted several hours of my time reading this sorry excuse for a book. And yes, ranting review did make me feel better. But hey, props to the author for managing to profit off of something that should have never left her own personal mean machine. And props to Americans for being stupid enough to deem this as a good read.
0060566108|5.0|This is a great book and learning tool. It was great to order and it showed up on schedule too!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great! !  I recommend reading it once, take a break, then read it again. Repeat. Use an electronic reader, too. For me, Katniss displays the concept of wisdom.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It has suspense and romance all in one.  I read it in 2 days.  I recommend this book to everyone.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love the TV series and bought this season for my mother who is a huge fan.  The combination of mystery and the occasional fandom tidbit is delightful.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Ok so I have a few friends who play this so since its free, I gave it a try. It ROCKED! I don't think that the game is for little kids or for adults though. Maybe around my age, teens. Well at the beginning it seemed hard but once you get to play it becomes clear that the game is fun. The part that gets me going is that you can challenge your friends from Facebook! Well I wanna go play so peace. Enjoy your game, and you day. :)
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I would have given it a five but, at times the it seemed contrived.  I love the characters and I can not wait to see how this plays.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Good for the money. It fits my kindle hd fire that I received as a gift for Christmas perfect. I feel better carrying it around knowing its protected. Thanks Amazon for having what I need always!
B00007AJGH|5.0|Had the movie on VHS and loved it, no longer own a VHS and had to upgrade to DVD. Really a classic
B005K17RU0|5.0|Excellent app does what it says. So many apps are not what indicated by the developer. It is rewarding apps perform the way the developer intended.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Movie is awesome, would recommend this to any father or anyone thinking of becoming a father. Can help you understand what a father is to a child.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I've read every book in this series and I have to be honest there have been solid hits, and some slight misses.  This was one of the best books in the series.  It laid out new characters, new enemies, and had a great story.  It kept me completely engaged from beginning to end and left me thinking about what will be coming next.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was very good. It kept my interest.<br /><br />Love story with the main characters having mental health issues... Strange but interesting.
B0010T0JC4|5.0|Many, many years ago I purchased my first pair of Crocs. It was the first time I tried on a shoe and it fit perfectly. Working 12 hour shifts in an Emergency Department which is usually on your feet the whole time I never had to soak sore feet when I collapsed at home. The original Crocs did not have the black sole but the other ones were the exact same and must be a good seller because you did not have my size. The environment I work in is not conducive to the Crocs with holes. Love the product and love the price.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I keep this sharpener in my &#34;go&#34; bag.  It is very handy and practicle.  I especially appreciate the compact size.  I would recommend to anyone.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is awesome when you first see it in the app store, but the minute you download it you notice the glitches<br />These are some of the glitches that i have found<br />1. When you complete a level you are supposed to get bonus gold unless you open a chest, never have i once received bonus gold  THIS MAKES BUYING NEW GEAR NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE!<br />2. The soundtrack is horribly messed up so bsd that i dont play with sound at all<br />3.Sometimes on multiple levels enemies will spawn but the will be invisible and invincible(this is on the first level too)<br />4. Multiplayer doesnt work, it loads for 10 sec but does nothing.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I love this series and have seen it countless times. I owned it on DVD and must say it was well worth buying again on Blu-ray. the picture looks amazing.Best picture quality I've seen on any blu-ray.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I LOVE this game. It is so fun and addicting. Once you get a really high score you just can't  trying to beat it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I had to read this book for school and I LOVED it! It keep my attention and had twists you didn't see coming! I strongly suggest reading this book!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so fun and time wasting for kids. I love the different characters and train stations that you can get when you update the game. I recommend this to any one who likes adventure or action games. All my friends have it and they like it as much as I do. I hope this review gets more people who are looking for a good game to play this amazing one.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|If you are not a Maroon 5 Fan, this album will definitely make you one.  I have always loved their music, but this album is the best one yet.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|in my book, in his top 3 creations. I love Nils Lofgren on piano and the guitars on this one are awesome
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I was having so much trouble putting my book up on kindle, I just could not figure it out. Until I downloaded this little gem which took me step by step through the process that helped an oldie like me work it out.  So much so that I now have my book in perfect working order on kindle.  If I had of had this in the beginning I would have saved myself a lot of frustration.  So if you want to put a book on the wonderful kindle, this guide is a must and all you will need to do it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book was written with a lot of twists and turns.There were so many twist and turns that it made the book more science fiction then a good mystery.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a really nice game I like it because it has a police and surf boards it is fun
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is often touted as a being about BDSM. That's not really accurate. It's a romance/love story which references some, limited, aspects of BDSM. Ana is about to graduate college and finds herself enamored with an unbelievably rich and powerful man. Christian is a man who needs control over others to deal with his own issues. It's a bit of a Romeo and Juliet however it's not their families that keep them apart, it's her insecurities over his status (insert the &#34;what does he see in a poor girl like me&#34; nonsense) and his internal struggle with how he was taught to deal with his trauma.<br /><br />If you picked this up because you wanted a story about characters living a BDSM lifestyle then you will be sorely disappointed. If your looking for a romance with some decent sex and lively characters then you may like this book. One thing to be prepared for is that the book ends on a cliff. If you want a happy ending then you will be forced to get book 2.
1449325947|5.0|I had ordered this before it came out and i was happy to get an email of when it was ready to be shipped. My husband has been enjoying reading this book because it is a new edition.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|While there are some very tender and sweet moments in the book I kind of feel like this one was written solely to tie up a few loose ends from the previous two. There are several chapters of fluff in the beginning where the story is stalled as the author catches us up on what happened in the lapse between books. Once that is settled we are back to Christian being controlling and Ana doing something dumb again, sending Christian into yet another tantrum. There is some action in this book and we get an interesting epilogue of Christian and Ana's first meeting from Christian's point of view along with other passages of Christian as a child.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|So, this will definately be a hit with the kids.  It's got good songs and interesting characters.  My son has been asking to watch it daily.  My problem with this movie is that it appears a certain agenda is trying to be pushed.  I was fine with the movie up until the very end which made absolutely no sense.  Everything is going wrong and the bad guys are about to win, but then the main character uses heavy machinery to randomly destroy a wall and everyone's perspective immediately changes.  The message is cause mass destruction to get everyone's attention and it will change their mind?
B00846REIS|3.0|This book often comes up as a &#34;If you liked 50 Shades&#34; book. It's a quick light read but I wouldn't compare it to 50 other than it envolves an aggressive guy and a girl. The story is fast paced and aggressive in part because both main characters are determined to be in charge of the relationship. The story is more Bodice Ripper than Romance. There is no BDSM in this book but there is an aggressive male who needs to control sex in order to deal with his own issues and a sexually aggressive female who likes to be in control because her own past. There are a lot of stalker elements in this book as well as some fun characters like Eva's boss and roommate (who has his own issues as a secondary story).<br /><br />This is not the type of book you read because your looking for a believable story line. It's what you read because you enjoy sexually aggressive characters and train wreck relationships.
B005KMX866|5.0|Chris Isaac makes his own version of the Sun Studio hits. My favorites are &#34;I Walk the Line&#34; and &#34;Great Balls of Fire.&#34; Two CDs of Dixie Fried fun.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I'm not exactly sure how I keep get sucked into this series. It's a quick easy read and continues the saga of Eva, the high maintenance nightmare and Gideon, the over sexed and obsessive CEO.  The book takes a weird turn in the second 1/2 as it attempts to go from Bodice Ripper to Mystery/Crime drama in which the Eva is left very confused because, like all lead male characters with histories of abuse and control issues, Gideon won't trust Eva. In the end I understand what the author was going for but I think that she should have stuck with original intent of the book. Trying to change genres midstream is very hard to pull off at all, let alone do it well.<br /><br />I also had a hard time with the fact that no one seems to trust Eva in this book. Even though she's supposed to be a strong, alpha female, survivor type no one will tell her that she's in danger and instead keep the whole thing a secret even after the police come knocking on her door.<br /><br />I don't know if I'll read the next book or not. By the end of this one the sex scenes were getting boring and the characters were predictably dull.
B00006IRJU|4.0|I searched for this album after I lost my original one while moving house. I was pleased to find a good quality secondhand item on Amazon. The album itself is a good recording of Icehouse at their very best and it stands as a signature album for them. It is light 80's pop music and just about every track is a good one. This is one of the few albums in my music collection that I will listen to all the way through.<br />Item condition and quality was exactly as advertised and was shipped and delivered VERY promptly. Excellent service all-round!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I don't consider this the second book in the series. I consider it the rest of the first book and the beginning of the third. Book 1 ends poorly and book 3 has trouble starting mostly because critical information for each is actually in book 2. Like the first book this is a quick, light romance with some heart wrenching action add for good measure. The end of the book seems to be an afterthought complete with a printed dashed line which alerts you to the POV shift. If you skip this section then the book ends on a happy note and there is no reason to delve into book 3 unless you want to finish out the sideline story (which takes a bigger roll in book 3)
B007SGM084|5.0|I was hesitant to read the books after all the hype I heard about \\"mommy porn\\" but to my surprise the story of these two characters captured my heart!
0805047905|5.0|This is a must have for any child's library. The story follows a set pattern so that young children can quickly follow along learning their animals and colors.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Looks horrible, doesn't work or shows the entire news feed. Boring! I'd rather use the web than this dumb app.
B00457WZEI|5.0|A beautiful heartfelt tale about a horse who goes to war, and the horses and people he meets. At times this was sad, but I loved it. This is a must read!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I love all three series I wish there were more to the novel. They were great, I loved them all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow! Wow! Wow! This book is simply amazing! I can't remember the last book that played with my mind and shocked me! I think it was last years \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\". I don't even know how many times I said \\"only one more chapter.\\" if life didn't get in the way, I could have finished this alot sooner. It was like reading a twisted version of the Scott Peterson case. I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending. I think I need time to just think about the whole thing. What a great book though! I will say, this would make an AWESOME movie!<br /><br />Edit: I read this in June 2012 and you know what?! I still think about this book constantly! It still wows me! I am always looking for my next \\"gone girl like book\\" and so far I haven't found one as good as this. Definitely an all time favorite!
B003Y5D776|5.0|This item did exactly as described. Been using it non-stop to transfer cassette tapes and VHS onto my Mac without any problems
B000FC1IPO|2.0|I am taking a sigh of relief and saying \\"i'm finally done!\\". The book started off pretty good... But after a while it got a bit repetitive and mostly boring. I did have a couple times I did smile but it wasn't enough to turn the book around. I'm not even sure I liked Kate. I think it could have been a shorter book and not so much \\"blahness\\". Most of the time it felt like it was reading like a list. I dont like reading lists for books. This wasn't my cup of tea!
B0095R64AO|2.0|The preview covered every possible point you might like about this movie.  It was a waste of money.  Thank goodness I didn't see it at the theaters. Ugh.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever two thumbs up so cool, cant put it down i will play it for hours. Never have i played a cooler game
B003PIS5XI|4.0|Today, they'd make this as an animated film from Dreamworks or Pixar and it would be better for it. The film tries really hard with the SFX possible at the time, but it's tough to swallow when there are computer games around whose SFX are generations more advanced.<br /><br />The transfer is excellent for a film this old, little to no grain or noise and no apparent discoloration or other artifacts.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think it should let u ride and clean the horse and it doesn't so its not very fun u should change it around a bit then it would be fun.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|If you (like me) purchased the first PATTON BD and were disappointed, 20th Century Fox has more than made amends with this new release.<br /><br />The studio fully resorted and rescanned the film and the result is reference quality video and audio.  Unlike the first BD release which suffered from over-edge-ehnanced video that made it look hard and harsh, this edition is film-like perfection.<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS Master PCM Audio is peerless.  Great surround effects and the iconic Jerry Goldsmith score is stunningly beautiful.<br /><br />If you love the film, donate the first BD (and the DVD if you have it) to your local library and buy this one.  It will not disappoint!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I absolutely loved this cd! I have to say, though, that Lindsey's star shines brightest in her music videos where she totally captivates her audience through her use of music, dance and choreography. Her imagination is seemingly limitless and I look forward to seeing more from her.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I have not read any part of this series but it seems from the reviews and the hype that one should locate and read THE STORY OF O...the first and best of its kind.<br /><br />If folks like to read poorly written porn then the FIFTY SHADES series is it.  I have only read excerpts and do not intend to pursue it further.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is a pretty good game! the tilting is a little harder to use then the first addition, but its still super cool. I'm still not sure which version I like better......
B00B04NJI0|5.0|I just watched this movie and it has to be my new favorite horror movie.  This collection is a toss up between cheesy camp comedy to brutal gore. I spent as much time laughing as I did repulsed.  Not to mention that quite a few of the stories keep you guessing how the video is linked to the letter. Some of them especially \\"P\\" I was like P is for poverty, prostitue, poor, putrid, and then the screen says P is for Pressure. Personally, I hope there is a follow up.  I really loved this and when it gets a DVD release I am buying it.  I have a lot of friends who love horror and you better belive we are going to have a movie night with this one!
B008IEWBJ8|5.0|The quality of the vinyl used is outstanding.<br />The scope of changes that Richter makes to these classic pieces ranges from minor to all-encompassing.<br /><br />Love the embellishment of Summer 3.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This glitch is really comedic and freaky what happens is that if you make an underground house/mine even if it's really well lit up mobs still spawn in it this is the only thing that I have a problem with this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is amazing I love the silliness and the mine I love the gins that you get and they will save you
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love playing UNO on my ipad, it is very different than playing with real people.I have it on my kindle fire also so others in my family can play.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I choose this rating cause I've read the books 1&2 and also saw the movie which followed book 1 and the books are just well written.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I read this book on the recommendation of other amazon readers and was glad I did, well written, very believable characters, although it is a fiction, written like a true story. I will look for more from Kathleen Grissom.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game for the Kindle fire . I hope that is a subway surfer two for the Kindle fire.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Great movie go see it a lot of action as always in a Stallone . You should go see it .i rate it at 3 stars
B00005JKZV|4.0|Will be one of the classic films in the years to come!  Great story and visual effects make this a super second part to a breathtaking trilogy!
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Excellent Read & it was very similar to the show with just a few different things so seeing how I'm very into the show, it kind of felt like I was rereading it & it was somewhat predictable.
B008DM4OTA|3.0|This is a fun game that my daughter plays again and again.  I would say it really isn't educational in anyway.  Also there are only about 6 or so different issues with the animals so I think after only 10 minutes of play it starts repeating again.  The graphics are cute and with the amount my 5 year old plays it I definitely got my money worth.  I would have rated it higher if it had more content.
B000UE29SW|5.0|Maggie, I had a copy of this many years ago and had read it numerous times, but it was lost at some point, so when I found it on here I just had to get it. That book helped me through many rough times in my life, and I am so happy that this book is back in my library.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|One of my all time favorite albums. Have been listening to it since it came out.  Defines the grunge era.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Likes it better than one, because of the weave, turn and jump.  they like the roap and the new twist and turns.
B00B2LRK7W|4.0|Another solid album from Hatebreed.  It's not as strong as their last 2 albums, which in my opinion are the strongest of their careers.  If you like Hatebreed, you will like this album.  Some bands try different things on each album or evolve over time.  Hatebreed has evolved very little over time.  So there are no surprises.  Which to me is what makes Hatebreed great.  You know what you are getting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very fun.  Could and have played this game all day long.  Passing through the tunnel is a challenge.  A must play
B003SAF76Q|5.0|Before this album I was a casual Parkway Drive fan but this album is amazing!  If will kick you in the face and make you bang your head into the wall.  This is by far the best Parkway Drive album in my book.  Put this one at the top of your list.
B005LAII80|5.0|I watched the movie, loved it, bought the DVD, still love it.  I've had no problems with the quality of this product.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Horribly written, but I've been reading this at lunch between bites, a couple pages at a time.  Great escapist book.
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|Perfect!! He is so talented !! Cool that he got other artist with him :)!<br /><br />If you want a amazing experience, buy this!!!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Everyone already knows Adele is awesome.  What more can be said that hasn't already been said?  She's just absolutely great!
B006PYHYXG|5.0|I think this is a must have for anybody which have the mounting arm since that way you would have a lot more space to park your monitor or TV. I would recommend this item
6302902010|5.0|Back in the day, my Mom took us to the park to the outdoor opera to see this and I was moved then and I still love this. Movie or live, it so very good@@@
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I really enjoy playing Free Cell and I have learned how to win almost everytime.  It is better than working crossword puzzles.
B003O86FMW|5.0|By far the best book I have ever read. I highly recommend it to every one no doubt in my mind
B0007DAZW8|5.0|Nothing more can be said about this album other than the fact that it is amazing on all levels. Forget about people who rated it poorly, as they are most likely not \\"true\\" fans. It falls nothing short of the iconic \\"daft punk\\" sound and does not disappoint... AFTER ALL
1451695195|4.0|This book gives you a different perspective on &#34;Religon&#34;. Like the age old question where is Heaven? Is it in our galaxy or somewhere we can't see.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I'M SO GLAD THEY HAVE THE KINDLE VERSION, SUPER FUN AS ALWAYS. If you play any of them on the pc this is super fun on the tablet. Wedding dash is awesome to.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you thought season one was interesting....season two will have you hooked! Buy the whole season, you'll want them all.
B002BWP49C|5.0|love this series.  The movie definitely met my expectations.  The last movie in the series tied this all out very well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Beautiful.entertaining. shocking. Loving. What more could I possibly say. I'd read it again and again and again. I hope the movie is just as good.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I haven't had a small tablet type device before, the fit and protection is very adequate for my uses. If I was more familiar with the other products, I would probably gone with a leather case.
B007VWEEQQ|4.0|It would be better if the cable were offered with a longer run, but it functions perfectly when mated with Miccus Mini-jack RX Bluetooth receiver.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I ordered this cable to use for my PC with my TV. I find the cable is perfect for running my keyboard, mouse, and gamepad from the comfort of my recliner.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|We have two children, one a six year old and the other a three year old.  They both love this program.
B00AZ3KPZC|5.0|This is a great Disney classic. My boys love this movie from start to end. It's entertaining for kids and adults!!!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Both of our children (ages six and three) love this program.  They like to experiment with the different patterns created by using the different drawing tools.
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|Not only does my kids watch this but my husband and I enjoy it very much as well. Magical Christmas Movie.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|This is much too difficult for young children (six years old and under) to master.  All they can do is listen to the music as it plays automatically for them, and watch the keys move.
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|The storyline was a bit interesting because it was a story not very well known. The acting was terrible, however, including the ever so dull Ben Affleck. I tried watching it a second time after it won \\"Best Picture\\" thinking I must have missed something. I couldn't force myself to watch more than about the first half hour. There are so many better movies.
B003L20IJM|5.0|Funny movie, Just as funny as Nanny McPhee. I hope they make more sequels so long as Emma Thompson is in it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Who is the mockingjay and can she hold up her world as everything crashes to pieces will the bird ever fly to happiness ?
B004FRX0MY|2.0|The Music is very expensive. I can find the same thing on line for a better price. I couldn't get the shortcut on my android.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|So many plot lines, so little time.  Each of the characters is so well developed.  We even love to hate the bad ones.  What fun.  Sometimes it is hard to keep up.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|I havent read the book yet, but I have heard that it is very good. And it was a free download.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked everything about this book.  It was riveting right from the start.  I couldn't wait to start the next book once I finished.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|I havent read the book yet, but I have heard that it is very good. And it was a free download
0061438294|5.0|I had gotten this book, because I wanted a brief introduction to Psychology of the body. This is so perfect, and meets all my expectations!
1878424602|5.0|This book is a must have for those on the spiritual path.  Deepak breaks the laws done to make it very understandable for everyone no matter where you are on your journey.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My grandson played this and loved it. Every weekend he comes to see nanny he always wants to play and ofcouse nanny always lets him.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I played this game and I loved it. I could play it all day long. I wish they would come up with another free game like this or somethime simlar I would play it also.
B0086700CM|5.0|You may think I am exasterating but I am not.I was thinking when I got it I would play on it but I really like it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Loved the story. Didn't care for the reading though.  Looking forward to the movies. Very curious about the casting and the effects.
0786958731|5.0|Not really.  Been playing P&P RPGs since 1980, and this was a fun break while giving you the feel.  Immensely replayable.  Bought all three sets to eventually mix and match.
1429218207|5.0|This book is being used for my inorganic chemistry 1 class, and I find it a great read, The pictures are excellent with lots of color and it is quite clear to understand them too.

B007QPFGJW|4.0|We have read so many of Jo Nesbo's books.  I always think I would hate to live next door to someone who imagines so many ways to kill someone.

B007C7UZIG|5.0|This provides basically everything I could want in a steam app. I used it to purchase games on sale while away from the computer as well as keep in touch with friends.<br /><br />The only thing I would want is some of the other community features like game hubs.
B000001IQG|5.0|staple 90s punk rock album.  its necessary to own and even better on vinyl.  This album's been a staple in my mp3 player, in my cd collection, and now a fine vinyl piece on my wall
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Mind blowing! A great read, though at times a little predictable. I really recommend  this book, a nice mystery and thriller
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I use to love playing Pinball on my computer.  I lost that when I bought a new computer and I missed it.  So when I saw this app I had to try it.  I love it!!  it is so much fun to be able to play Pinball again, best part I can now take it with me wherever I go!! I would recommend this to anyone who loves playing Pinball games.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|Out of all the very many toys I researched and ordered for my infant grandbaby, this one was the Best! She loved it the most out of all the crib hanging toys. It goes every where baby goes! It's a great toy for crib, car seat, stroller, walker and every place in between. It has been easy to keep clean and sanitize. The toy has held up to alot of usage and still looks new. We have had no safety issues with this toy. I highly recommend it and glad I bought it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great! My 8, 4,& 2 year old children can play this endlessly.  I find myself taking turns at the game as well.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|Nice information to have it also tells you about the rest of the people that have Wi-Fi around your building.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Awesome product!  I thought it would be a hassle to use, but it is quite easy to handle, even with arthritis!
B004UID2LC|4.0|I have downloaded almost twenty songs and has worked every time. Except for the videos, they don't always download right.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If you have ever thought about dying. If you have ever been in love.  If you have ever been hurt. If you have ever wanted. A book truly for everyone.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is incredible. Kyle is not just a legend but also a great story teller. His spirit lives on in all those willing to put their lives on the line to defend others. RIP Chief Petty Officer Chris Kyle, the Devil of Ramadi.

B004J64QSI|5.0|The item was exactly as described and more than fulfilled my expectations. I would suggest to anyone to buy this, and I would tell them it can be found on Amazon.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|What ! This was the end of all ends! Terrible! You left us hanging! I have loved every book-BUT to end like this??

1476719071|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am an avid reader who never reads the same book twice, but I read this one again. I wasn't sure I would enjoy it because the characters are a litte younger than I usually read but I was glad I did. The love story is told so well that I couldn't put it down. I am looking forward to reading it from Travis' point of view!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a definite must have!  This is a game that I cant seem to put down. If you enjoy simple but clean fun than this game is for you. I have a 5 year old nephew who even enjoys this game. So give it a shot and try the free download today.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|And a 12 on a one-to-ten scale of erotica.  Exquisitely effective scenes of erotica strung together by a gossamer thin story line. A recent college grad falls in love with an unbelievably handsome, unbelievably well hung, and unbelievably wealthy self-made gazillionaire who, by the way, also falls for her.  Perfect, right?  Tension is provided by the fact that not only is Mr. Grey a master of love making but he is also into bondage and dominance that crosses slightly over the line into S&M.<br /><br />The bulk of the first book in the trilogy is made up of love scenes and obsessions over whether this is the man for her. This book is a rather strange creature.  Written from the point of view of the woman, it is probably best suited for a lovelorn teenager with developing Marquis de Sade proclivities.<br /><br />I can't speak for the other two volumes.  I abandoned it after the first because I kept waiting for plot and character development that never really happened.  But even guys can appreciate the erotica contained in this novel.  If you're looking for a hot date and can't find one, this book will made do as a substitute.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|She loved it when she opened it on her birthday. Now I want to watch it lol. It looks exciting.
B004HD61KE|5.0|A really good science fiction thriller set today combining scientific and historical research.  The Native American background is fascinating, the reality of what lies below Yellowstone chilling as always.
B0012Z36X0|5.0|ALL HAIL QUEEN ERYKAH!<br /><br />This album is stupendously dope with hip-hop beats over revolutionary loves songs.  She makes you stop what you're doing to listen to her spill the beans on her own self.  She loves her people.  She's learning about herself.  And she takes you on a journey with respect to the journey of her listener.  I give this album four thumbs up.  I'm borrowing the hands of my downstairs neighbor.  He has to like it as well.  He hears it everyday with me through his ceiling.<br /><br />I don't have a favorite track.  So please don't expect me to list one.  I love all songs equally.
0143119680|1.0|Sorry Deborah Harkness, I can't fault your writing but this particular subject is getting old. This is not a book I would have picked up on my own. I prefer literary novels which require deep thought but my book club voted and I was forced to read A Discovery of Witches. I think it's well suited for the YA crowd so if you liked Twilight or Harry Potter you will probably enjoy this series as well. I like Harkness's love of books and her research on Alchemy. I just wish they played a more significant/serious role in the story. The majority of the story is spent on blow by blow details of action which were irrelevant to the plot. Do we really need to know, she opened the door, she picked up her yoga bag, she looked this way, she looked that way--this is a problem with most first person narratives, the author believes we have to see everything the character sees. A little narration goes a long way. If it doesn’t move the story forward, leave it out.  If I can skim for twenty pages at a time and not miss any key plot points or character development well...that’s a problem.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Once you start the game its hard to stop.  I really ejoyed the great graphics. The story was very entertaining.
B009IK5UJ4|4.0|I had the previous edition of this but the latest 2 disc release is a vast sound improvement and worth the purchase.  I am glad I picked it up.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it gets really adicting but I wish it had some of the stuff from temple run 1 would have been five stars but needs more better charecters
B00915G6SU|5.0|It is so nice to see this program without commercials. I love this program but it always seems to break often so I like the DVDs.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fantastic graphics.  Game is challenging - at least for me.  It's fast paced and really keeps my interest.  I can't believe the game is free.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Excellent story, very suspenseful and well written. The author has a wonderful way of describing human feelings in this very emotional book.The only thing I did not like was the ending - The crazy, psycho lady  (called something else in book) should have received the punishment she deserved. A sequel maybe?
B0063IH60K|4.0|Everything about this  game is great. I enjoy how I can pass time on this game. I enjoy playing multiplayer. The only issue is that there were times where it would cancel out. Great game overall.
B002BWP49C|4.0|A very tasty story about love and death dancing with wolves, mixing happiness and sadness, despair and hope - and sex and blood!,
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love Michael Connelly`s characters and this is another one of his books that did not let me down.  Suspense at the top of its game.
B007EECSFA|4.0|After a slow start to the book, Kate Morton spins a tale that is engrossing. It is a story of family, love and hate. The backgound of the story  is WWII in London. The action weaves back and forth through childhood into adulthood...tracing the lives of several siblings. In my estimation, it is worthy of 4 Amazon stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|word this game is tight. have good characters and different boards. like all people cheats as well.i like the skate boards and new boster
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is awesome!!!!!! I am in love with subway surfers!!!! I play it all the time!<br />  I really really really want to unlock carmen in the Rio version!
B0039LYGK2|5.0|Watching this movie in 1987 I could see he beginning of the end that arrived in 2008. Gordon Gecko is the embodiment of the &#34;vulture capitalist&#34; and the Master of the Universe mentality which puts short term personal gain above the good of the country's economic future. Aside from Platoon it is Oliver Stone's best effort. Michael Douglas absolutely chilling and Charlie Sheen gives his second best dramatic performance.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The author is of course the best and I love all her books but Bone Bed is over the top. A true thriller that will keep you up late at night reading it. Not for the weak at heart.
B0013YPEMG|5.0|Batman movies with The Joker are the best of the lot, Nicholson in this one and Ledger in The Dark Knight. Michael Keaton filled the role of Batman better than anyone expected and Nicholson was everything you would want a darker and more demented version of Caesar Romero's Joker to be. Then there is the eye candy which is Kim Bassinger. This was a treat to every fan of the old TV show, with badass Batgadgets, real bullets and real ass-kicking.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|As an Amazon Prime member I'm able to view this for free but it was such a wonderful documentary that I wanted to contribute to the creators and also have a hard copy so I can watch it without having to be sitting at the computer.<br /><br />It's a wake up call that everyone should truly understand and spread the word as well.<br /><br />Vegetarian, Vegan, Raw is the way to go.
B009653J0S|5.0|The collaboration with Robert Rodriguez, the introduction of Selma Hayek, the Tito and Tarantula soundtrack, Cheech Marin's carnival barker type sales pitch, the hilarious lines created out of bizarre character interactions and the badass cast make this Tarantino's third best movie after Pulp Fiction and True Romance. Sure Reservoir Dogs is a great movie too, but it doesn't offer the all-you-can-eat buffet yummy movie morsels you will find in any of the Top 3.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|AFTER PLAYING ABOUT AN HOUR I HAVE TO FEEL THE TOP OF MY HEAD TO MAKE SURE THE HEAD PHONES WERE STILL ON ME. VERY COMFORTABLE
B001I189MQ|5.0|Ultra dark and super intense. Christian Bale (the best Batman) is upstaged by Heath Ledger's performance as the ultimate Batman villain. There will be no better Batman movie. Ever.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|Emma Thompson is wonderful in everything she does.  This is just a great family movie..  The cinematography is beautifully done.  Colin Firth is FUNNY!  Enjoy this one over and over again.  But don't buy the second Nanny McPhee, you will be sorely disappointed.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I actually chose this book for my son and I ended up reading it. This book made me laugh..made me cry..made me kind. I truly recommend this book for everyone, really great story of a families love and how kids can totally surprise us for the better. Loved it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written, well acted and very enjoyable.  Even the characters I hate show redeeming qualities.  The class warfare of the times is very interesting to me.  I hated the team of &#34;O'Brien and Thomas&#34; but I truly love pitting them against each other.<br />They are dealing with social situations that sometimes seem out of place for the time in which they are supposed to be living. But, maybe that is part of what makes it so enjoyable.<br /><br />Because of the show, I read the history of Highclere Castle and delved into 1920's history.  I love it when a quality show makes me interested in history enough to research and talk about how it was.  Thank you BBC for this excellent program.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so fun!  I love the graphics and it is really addicting.  I highly recommend this app.  It is just so fun and really cute.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another one of Flynn best! I've lost a lot of sleep reading &#34;just one more chapter&#34;. But it was worth it.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Love the game, love how it is different from most zoo games because of the actual missions. One quirk.. if you buy things ahead, say before the mission it doesn't count when the mission starts. Example: one mission requires 2 garbage cans, i had one prior and out t doesn't count it. This is true for buildings as well. So, i give it a four star.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It works and it works well and it's free.  Nothing else to say.  Try  it.  You can only be sorry if you don't.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Characters, for the most part, are consistently true to their nature.  Show is courageous in its tackling serious issues and in its tapping into some of the dark spots of human behavior.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The white noise app is comforting especially coming from the kindle fire hd .....like the variety of sounds....just right ...
B0006HBERA|4.0|I bought this game for my preschool class. The quality is sturdy,the set up was quick and the concept was easily understood after a complete round. The only thing I didn't like was how long it took to play the game. Some of the children began loosing interest, they stuck with it with my encouragement. I'm planning on making one counting space out of two by scanning the game board and creating a single where there was two.
B00683JK9K|3.0|I prefer to not use the rotate option and the puzzles seem to go smoothly.<br /><br />Too bad it always crashes half way through (reason for 3 stars) and you can't save puzzles in progress. I have a Nexus S and have re-started my phone a few times thinking that was the problem, but that did not solve the crashing issue.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I got drawn in immediately. Excellent performances by all involved. Loved the OMG revelations. Much better viewing on DVD than week by week.
B00A812HOS|4.0|It took about six months. I'd owned Unknown Mortal Orchestra's self-titled debut six months before those gritty, murkily produced sonic nuggets wormed their way into my brain and have remained since. Sure, `Thought Ballune', `FFunny FFriends' and `How Can U Luv Me' were instantly likeable, and made there way onto a few mixes. But tracks like `Nerve Damage!', `Little Blu House', and `Strangers Are Strange' took more time. They needed to sit in the brine a bit longer before their full flavor could be appreciated. But once their lo-fi beauty blossomed they became staples of my musical diet. So last fall when I heard `Swim and Sleep(Like a Shark)' I felt this new UMO record could be one of the best of 2013.<br /><br />\\"Isolation can put a gun in your hand\\" is the first thing that comes out of Ruban Nielson's mouth on ll, and that sets the mood for this sophomore release that doesn't suffer from any sort of slump. You get the feeling, both in his music and interviews, that Nielson wades in solitude's dark waters often. It seems to be part of his process. Without that element of loneliness UMO wouldn't be UMO. \\"I'm so lonely, but I can never quite reach the phone\\" Nielson admits later on. The isolation allows this artist to create the way he creates. I'm sure this isn't the healthiest way to exist, but some of the best artists live a life of solitude so they can hear the voices clearly that resonate in their heads. `Swim and Sleep(Like a Shark)' echos that sentiment to the extreme. \\"I'd fall to the bottom, and hide till the end of time\\" he sings before the refrain \\"that sweet, cold darkness\\". Is it a cry for help, or just a desire to be left alone in the quiet buzz of a studio, contemplating the end. Of what?  The song? The album? Life?  Maybe all three. Regardless, it's a melancholy trip that hints at the absolute greatness Ruban Nielson carries in his soul. `So Good At Being In Trouble' is a soulful R&B number that Al Green or Curtis Mayfield could've made into a soul staple back in the 70s. UMO hinted at this sort of groove on their last album, but here Nielson jumps in head first. He's created a genre unto itself: indie psych soul. `One At A Time' is an all out rocker, with a Dr. Q Envelope Filter giving the guitar that \\"quacking\\" funk noise and a chorus straight out of Arena Rock: 101. If they ever play an arena, this one will rock the joint for sure. `The Opposite of Afternoon', `No Need For A Leader' and `Monki' are the centerpiece tracks and the longest songs, making up close to half the album's run time. I find this move kind of bold. All three signficantly different. `The Opposite of Afternoon' a folksy number with some of Nielson's impressive guitar work. `No Need For A Leader' is a stranger beast, with a go-go beat, processed vocals, and guitars that sound like they were recorded under water. Finally `Monki' is seven minutes of dark vibes, studio magic, and an undercurrent of dread. Delayed guitars give the feel of things that go bump in the night, until the chorus comes in with a groovy guitar riff and Nielson's inner soul man shines. I feel with time these three tracks will become the highlight on an album filled with highlights. The short instrumental `Dawn' takes us into `Faded In The Morning' and a sunny end with `Secret Xtians'.<br /><br />Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Ruban Nielson continue the trend of solid songwriting. His murky production continues to reign supreme, yet the songwriting has reached a much higher plateau. Here's hoping Nielson can find his way out of that sweet, cold darkness. Or at least find some contentment as he feels his way through.taple back in the 70s. UMO hinted at this sort of groove on their last album, but here Nielson jumps in head first.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne should write more. These were great. I want more!<br />Gregor the Overlander was great, but there should still be more Hunger Games.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I had never played anything related to the persona series and even when the trailers and such came out, I was a bit skeptical. Not owning a ps2 (I skipped an entire console generation thanks to pc) I had NO idea how just amazingly addictive (one more day!)and endearing the social link aspect of this game would become. For me it was totally new and having just finished the game (60 hours without many of the side quests) I am in new game+ and loving every minute of it. I have to say that shohiko hirato sucked me into this game with her beautiful voice on songs like \\"your affection\\", \\"heartbreak\\", and signs of love\\". Meguro may be the writer but shohiko hirato nails every song...it adds so much to the atmosphere of the game that having gone back to p3 fes, the FEEL is totally different. P4G is a MUST for any vita owner. If nothing else came out for the Vita forever, I would feel like I gotten my moneys worth with this game. Never played Persona? THIS is the one that will hook you. Don't own a Vita and are curious? GET IT. It is one game you will say, damn, I got my moneys worth 10 times over! Thank you Atlus!
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Denzel, knavely to clever to be understood is best suited for action adventure yarns like The Book of Eli in which he sparkled.<br /><br />He has the credibility credentials to be an action hero. His considerable talents should be employed in good, interesting adventures not in stuffy drama about an airplane accident. Consider The Flight a bore. A lengthy dullard. Its only merit being the beast with two backs ripped from Shakespeare's Othello.<br /><br />Lasted 20 minutes with this bore before I dropped the view. The interracial romance, what I saw of it was well handled and tasteful. That topic is something I don't particularly like.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|This litle card comes in very handy, keeping multiple SD cards in a safe accessable place. The SD cards fit snugly into the card with ease of removal. Great idea, wish I would have thought of it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app for my kindle fire! its very funny and exciting and much better than the first temple run you fan a whole lot more in this one
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Reminds me a bit of the 80's along with Fiona Apple with a smack of pop/raunchy lyrics. I love it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|pretty realistic but not sure how to get surtain things on it. like how to unlock some things.lollllkkkmmlll lkl lklj lkk kkm lkk kkl
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Great movie, funny and entertaining for the whole family.  We like to have at home movie night at least several times a month and this one was definitely one of our favorites!  We recently watched Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs and would recommend that one too.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|I enjoyed the storyline as much as the Actors who perform in it. Great family movie you can sit down with the entire family and watch together for once!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I am very fond of this app. With this app I can:<br /><br />- Browse/Copy/Rename the files on my android phone or the SD Card<br /><br />- Browse/Copy/Rename the files on my wireless hard drive<br /><br />- Browse files via... lan, ftp, bluetooth, net<br /><br />- Multi-select files.<br /><br />- Play files with a built in ES Media Player or hand off to a 3rd party player.  Combine this with its ability to browse your network and you can use your phone to play any media file on your network onto any monitor in your home.<br /><br />- Backup/Restore your Apps, which is useful for:<br /><br />-- Apps you want to have handy but not installed (the KindleFire1 has this \\"memory for Apps\\" vs \\"memory for files\\" problem that this solved.<br /><br />-- Restoring older version of programs that worked better than the current version. Since Dolby forced all iOS media player to remove support for decoding ac3, will Android be next?<br /><br />-- Installing apps in the Google Play store (or just any apk you have) onto your Kindle. Install the app on your phone, back it up with ES, copy it to your Kindle, restore it with ES. Easy.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|my firend recommended it to me so I got it and I think that it is just plain awesome. so yeah you should really get it its really fun
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second installment of the Hunger Games trilogy is captivating and dives deeper into the world of Panem. It provides more insight to the happenings in Panem, and the effects that the last hunger games had on people. There are  many new surprises and new lovable characters that further enrich the series. Catching Fire is a great read that will remain on my mind and my bookshelf for a lifetime.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I think that this software should be included with your purchase. Very useful when constructing a document to use formally with clients.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|One of my favorite classics.  I sat down and read it cover to cover as a kid and I still love it today.
159420229X|5.0|This is a very entertaining read.  Some of the techniques used can easily be put into use to help you remember lists etc.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I love this series so much I wish they would make it a movie. I loved these books are more than Twilight.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A wonderful true to life story.  As a high school teacher and parent, I see these kids.  I know these kids.  It was wonderful.  A charming story that I look forward to sharing with  my daughter.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|All John Grisham books are good.  I've read all three of the Theodore Boone novels and have enjoyed all three.  However, I feel that the ending are a bit flat.  I think Mr. Grisham got tired and just wanted to get the work submitted.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I had fun with this game but would like a bit more information on how it works.  I mostly figured it out for myself.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app it is very very organized you can add a picture to your notes and you can also used as a notebook which that's what I used for
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use, not very challenging but good old solitaire on my Kindle.  I could waste a lot of time playing this game.
0738212415|4.0|I homeschool my children and take them to a co-op once a week. One of the moms there uses this book to teach a class of about 15 children ranging in ages from about 8-14. It is a fantastic step by step process and she says she has been using it for 3 year to successfully teach children to draw. I am absolutely buying a copy to have at home.
B008745B32|3.0|I know this novel is greatly revered.  It is eloquently written.  It is also so intensely British that much of it escaped me!  For that reason I can't praise it highly - I missed too much!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|At first I couldn't see any of the bible reading plans, but I learned that you have to have it in the upright or vertical  position like you would when reading a book otherwise they don't show up. The other thing is you have to be signed in, but that wasn't the problem because I am signed in always I guess on my Kindle. So once I turned it to the vertical positions, all the reading plans showed up. Apparently there is a bug in the app and it won't read it in landscape (horizontal) position. Since then it's been great!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Take the idea of Frank Miller's classic. Hand it over to Warner Brothers and their superior story boarders, artists, animators and voice artists. And sit back and be amazed!<br /><br />Miller's concept and story is all there. Faithfully adhered to. With some of the rougher edges smoothed over, but not too much.<br /><br />Keep the cramped and crowded feel of Gotham intact, but stylize it a bit. Put deep, dark 'Gotham Noir' shadows wherever there is no light. Put that in the hands of Andrea Romano and her innate skill at finding the right voices. And you have the makings of a classic at your fingertips!<br /><br />Peter Weller's voice of Bruce Wayne and the Dark Knight fits. Aged and mellowed a bit, but only on the outside. As does David Selby as Commissioner Gordon and Michael McKean as the obnoxiously arrogant Dr. Wolper. The rest of the cast meshes well, but it's the visuals and artwork that sets the tone and plants that flag deeply.<br /><br />All of Miller's iconic \\"money shots\\" are well rendered. But its the artists' work with shadow and the Dark Knight's reaching out from them to render justice that takes things up a notch. The Dark Knight may not be as quick as he once was, but reestablishing a legend takes time. That, and an all too squishy media is more than ready to pick up on.<br /><br />If you are a fan and something of a purist of the original Warner Brothers series. You'll find that things haven't changed all that much in Gotham. It's more crowded, dirtier, more run down and scarier. Thanks to Jay Oliva's meticulous direction. If you're a fan of Frank Miller epic. You'll be far from disappointed!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE Pinterest, but it's SO addicting. I want so many of the things I see on there, but of course you can't have it all as they say.
0061537969|5.0|Has an interesting perspective. It is an easy read. Very memorable. Also touching. Ver funny and quite sad at same time.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I think facebook is alot better than myspace. I just wish they would quit changing things. Always having to adjust settings is annoying, but I am more connected because of facebook IMO.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|nice graphics and lots of different levels to play.  what ccan you say about a game?  I enjoy playing this game.
B004I9CXHW|4.0|I use this on my  '13 VW Golf mainly to charge my phone (android). I works as a charger but I've never tried to use for playing music, so can't comment on that.
B000AA4JMK|5.0|I bought this for my kids.  We sing the songs at bedtime (I was in a production as a child) and they really wanted to see it.  They LOVE it!  This package is awesome because you get both the movie and the CD in one.  For this price, it's worth it even if you want just one or the other.<br /><br />Try this with your kids...next time they ask for more of anything, just say MOOOOOOORE!
B0066WJLU6|1.0|I bought this and never used it.  Honestly I do not even see it in my apps, so I must have done something wrong.  I would try it if I can figure it out.

B00683JK9K|3.0|I love doing jig saw puzzles, so this fullfills my need to do one and not have to tie up the dining room table for a week.  I also like that you can select the number of pieces.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Not an avid reader, but picked this book up during a business trip.  Finished reading the first one in a couple days during the same business trip.  Got addicted to the books and I spent any free time I had reading.  Looking forward to reading the next one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I Am In Love With This Game And I Love This Horse:) I Just Wish There Could Be More Excitement!(:
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful story!  I thank PBS for this production.  Recomended for everyone!  Hope we have a Season 4.  So easy to watch on Amazon instead of watching week to week.
0345505387|1.0|I have read all of the Outlanders books and I have enjoyed each one.  This one Is so bad It does not desire one star.  I would advise not to buy it.  I want my money back .
B0085KGHI6|5.0|If you like blues you will love this!  The Stones should do Blues too!  Very Well done for vintage video.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The case helps protect the kindle in style.  Feels nice to the touch and is tough as well.  It had a cool scent to it when it first came in too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surf is...AWESOME!!! I play all day everyday l!its addicting. I like it very much....sometimes even more than my boyfriend. Okay so woke information you should know before you purchase this amazing game is that its sort of like temple run...the more distance and money you get the faster you run. And the characters you can unlock are super funny. way better then temple run. Also you can change your skateboard which is a cool add on. So I suggest if you dont have subway surf...GET IT...now its for free in your apps section.
B007HO392S|5.0|I would buy just for the first two songs (Good Girl, Blown Away).  But the whole CD is really good too, I don't skip over any of her songs when they come up in my playlist.
B006ON41FC|1.0|controls really slow to respond on the kindle version so I would pass it up.  My friends have this on their smartphones and it was easy to play on them but not on a kindle
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm on Facebook everyday all the time posting commenting u name I do it...I would not know what to do without it
B009O2XY12|5.0|Another bubble popping game with more variety and lives so you have to advance to keep playing. Run out of lives and it is a wait for them to refill for free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it combineds templerun and exploring to different places you can buy stuff with the money you earn and it is challenging and fun to do if your thinking of getting this game get it :)
B0090YHSFC|3.0|Early levels very easy and then it is just a waiting game for the seals and penguins to move to the right spot after that.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Not nearly as good as the first season. Wish I wouldn't have paid for it and waited for free streaming.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|while it is of course very repetitive, it is still fun to play and I enjoy it more than the 1st one because it has more variety
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can not wait to read the next book! I COULD not put this book down it was so good!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good puzzle game and of course the higher levels are the most interesting but makes you go through lower levels first.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|I liked May's writing style -- and &#34;fell in love&#34; with the main character Fin<br />I can hardly wait to read the next in the Lewis series
B008X9Z4I8|4.0|After a recent trip in which i was forced to gate check my carry-on (with little time to repack/ retrieve) I realized that when I travel, everything (including things I had planned to hand carry) should be well protected.  While my cover keeps the device safe for routine daily use, it is no match for the airlines ;)<br /><br />  In fact, I have neoprene sleeve or cases for all my portable devices.  It is a material which provides a good cushion and has the added benefit of water resistance.<br /><br />The Belkin case is well made and fits well, but the material is a little thinner than most of the neoprene cases I have for my other devices.  Granted, the Kindle is light weight and solid, but when I buy qa case for protection (for travel, mail...) I want something substantial.  i gave this case 4 stars because the quality of construction is better than average, but the materials are not.  I expect that it will suffice for most situations, but will have to be better prepared the next time I board a plane, as I am not sure this would be adequate protection in a bag that was not well packed.<br /><br />If you are considering it for day to day use, it does provide better protection than most cases as it is cushioned and completely closed (something I find of benefit for devices which I carry in my purse). The downside as a day to day cover is that it is less convenient and you can not use the device with the cover on.  If you are considering this as an alternative to a sleeve, it offers better protection and about the same convenience.  The only caveat would be if you are using this for travel in a bag which might be checked.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. This app is very nice-looking and provides a lot of useful information concerning the health and strength of your device's battery.  I'm very glad that I purchased this app, as I refer to it several times a day.<br />Nearly 1 year has passed since I wrote the above, and I now have cause to really appreciate the Battery HD Pro.  For the last couple of months, my Kindle Fire HD has experienced a strange battery drain.  The time graph on the Battery HD Pro informed me that the drain always began at midnight.  I had tried deleting recently acquired apps.  I tried turning off Wi-Fi.  I made sure that the brightness and volume were in mid-range.  Nothing made a difference.  At midnight, the drain began again.  Not every night.... just every couple of weeks.  I had also noticed a slight warmth on the Kindle that hadn't been there before.<br />  Then, on the Kindle Help Forum, I read about the battery calibration under settings on the Battery HD Pro.  Why not?  So, I did.  And, I do believe that the problem has been resolved.  For one thing, the warmth has disappeared.  And, the Kindle passed through midnight without a problem.<br />  I should add that I also cleared the cache, and did a reset for the umpteenth time.<br />  Yes, the Battery HD Pro is proving to be a very useful app, indeed!
1427210241|5.0|After 20 plus years of living with this story, it felt like leaving my old family when it ended! Yes there were some minor holes in the story, but all in all it was well done and riveting. The ending was very satisfactory after years of speculation, many questions were answered (some still left open? another series?) and loose endings were tied up. For pure entertainment this was one of the best series of books I have read, and I have read many!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Both actors are superb, but movie was just a bit long.  Wasn't as funny as the trailers seemed to indicate. My wife is one who really wanted to watch it.
