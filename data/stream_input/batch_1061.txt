031606792X|5.0|This last book in the Twilight series I simply could not put down. And even when I was done reading it, I immediately went back for seconds and thirds. Simply unheard of for me, but I did - it was that good!    If you have already read books one through three, then you should be sufficiently hooked enough, to read the last book. Again, the romance is wonderful and Stephanie does a fantastic job of introducing one hurdle after another just when you think all is going just fine.    This book is absolutely action-packed, filled with suspense, humour and lots of emotion. Worth a five star rating.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Wonderful story -- you can't put the book (or in my case, the Kindle) down.   You have to wonder at the survival and endurance of not just the band, but Keith and Mick.  Fabulous.
B003ZDZ22U|5.0|If you are a Miley Cyrus or Hannah Montana fan then this record is an absolute must.    If you are not a committed fan then Miley actually has far more talent than her critics would have you believe so approach this one with an open mind.     You do not need to have watched the Hannah Montana series to like the songs but having context to the songs does help.   You might not get \\"Gonna get this\\" until you have watched the \\"Hannah's going to get this\\" episode so if this the first song you listen to skip over it and then come back to it later as it will surely grow on you. Been here all along, I'm Still Good and Love that Let's Go also take on a different dimension if you have watched the episodes.    Both Miley and Hannah music has become more dance/pop/techo over time and this album follows the trend.    Technical quality on this album is the best of the series and there is a good variety of songs from reggae style \\"Gonna get this\\" to a moving ballad in \\"Love that lets Go\\" which features Billy Ray Cyrus with some nice harmonies between the voices of Miley and her dad.     Stand out tracks are: Gonna get this, Ordinary Girl, Love that lets Go, I'm still Good, Been here all along and Barefoot Cinderella but all the tracks are very listenable.    Although it was generally reported that Miley was getting bored with being Hannah Montana - this is certainly not evident from the quality of her singing here and she really puts her heart into each of these songs.
B000ICLRJ8|5.0|\\"...The Mrkonji Grad incident occurred June 2, 1995 near Mrkonji Grad in Serb territory. He survived for six days by eating leaves, grass and ants, and avoiding Serb patrols while trying to contact Magic, NATO's airborne command center. He evaded capture and was rescued on June 8, by U.S. Marines of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit based on the USS Kearsarge.    The film Behind Enemy Lines is loosely based on his story. Although he gave it a positive rating on the movie review television show Hot Or Not, he attempted to sue the movie company in 2002 for making the film without his permission. O'Grady authored two books along with Michael French and Jeff Coplon detailing his experiences of being shot down over Bosnia and his eventual rescue -- Return with Honor and Basher Five-Two (O'Grady's call sign).    The incident was later depicted on the documentary television program Situation Critical in episode #5 \\"Downed Pilot\\", and \\"Escape! - Escape From Bosnia: The Scott O'Grady Story\\" on the History Channel.\\"  [...].

B00008DDHZ|5.0|For many years, 'Bloody Sunday' was to me simply a vague notion, an empty slogan repeated (or so I thought) to rationalise or justify any atrocity, now matter how abhorrent. A little knowledge is indeed a dangerous thing, particularly concerning an event that took place when I was only nine years of age. It was not until I had seen this film, masterfully directed in a chilling documentary style by Paul Greengrass, that I fully comprehended how significant Bloody Sunday actually was - and indeed continues to be - to Irish national identity, Indeed, there can be very little doubt or argument that this single event managed to set back the Irish peace process for at least three decades. In the meantime, both the innocent and guilty alike were pointlessly maimed and killed, and the utter futility of a relentless spiral of violence and retaliation renders any distinction between the culpability of the victims completely irrelevant.<br /><br />Centrally, this film is about the abuse of power, the unjustifiable and indefensible use of deadly force, and the lengths to which a government will go in stifling peaceful and legitimate dissent and manipulating public opinion to achieve its ends. In this manner, the British Government actually became what it claimed to despise and in so doing undermined the very values that made any society worth protecting in the first place. To the thoughtful and politically aware, these lessons have an unnerving relevance to the events of today.<br /><br />My initial reaction was that the film had a clear anti-British bias - further reading has, however, revealed that if anything, Mr Greengrass had deliberately (though understandably) soft-pedalled this important aspect presumably to avoid alienating a significant proportion of his potential audience. Had he revealed further factual details - and his portrayal of the British Paras is quite appalling enough as it stands - then I believe have would comprehensively undermined his position. Powerful understatement is the key to the film's devastating effectiveness.<br /><br />I had previously been led to believe, if only through my conventional British upbringing, that the Irish conflict was simply an endless and brutal game of atrocity and retaliation (the former, of course, invariably committed by foaming-at-the-mouth Republican baby-murderers), effectively becoming a demented game of \\"he hit me first\\". If there's one thing this film encouraged me to do - and if this was Mr Greengrass's aim, he succeeded admirably - is to investigate the facts on my own with an open mind, as free of emotion and bias as I could muster, reject previous prejudices instilled in me by well-meaning though misguided parents, and form conclusions of my own.<br /><br />The facts are these: the British Para Regiment's expectations of the violence they would encounter that day, presumably drummed into their heads by their politically-motivated superiors, became a self-fulfilling prophesy. Free speech and independent thought are hardly encouraged in a military hierarchy, and in this sense the Paras became victims as well, at the hands of their own government. They became willing victims in a sense, determined to even the score for the deaths of their comrades they had witnessed in previous encounters with the Provos, and were keenly encouraged in this pursuit by their superiors who should have known better but did not.<br /><br />Victims they may have been, but not nearly to the same extent as the dead who were left with no voice. They were either peaceful demonstrators - who were legally petitioning Her Majesty's Government for basic human rights such as freedom of speech and an end to detention without trial - or were simply innocent bystanders. A loose analogy may be drawn with Bloody Sunday and the US Army Reserve's actions at Kent State, Ohio in 1970 - the differences being not only that the body count in Londonderry was much higher, but public opinion was manipulated in the lattercase - after a sham inquiry and the medals having been handed out - to victimise the dead a second time and in the process exonerate the guilty.<br /><br />James Nesbitt's understated performance is masterful, as is Tim Pigott-Smith's as his mirror-image 'toff' British Army commander. The balance between the quiet and dignified outrage of the former and the bloody-minded stupidity of the latter is as heart-rending in the first case as it is infuriatingly convincing in the second. While I will not pretend that this is a pleasant evening's viewing, I will state with full conviction that is a necessity due to its powerful, compelling and honest depiction of the truth - too long obscured by a patina of deliberate bias, public relations spin, a government's appalling abuse of power and its malicious, politically-motivated mendacity.als having been handed out - to victimise the dead a second time and in the process exonerate the guilty.

B003QNXPUK|1.0|I agree with a lot of the reviews.  It was a great product for the IPhone 3GS, but lousy product for the IPhone 4.  The edges are peeling up.  I have installed Zaggs on various phones so the installation was not a problem, but even you let it dry properly it does not work well.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and HBO congratulations for making this epic piece of history of the Pacific Theater.  I was a huge fan of BOB and was excited to finally get to watch \\"The Pacific\\".    I recently received my Blu-Ray version from Amazon and I started watching it and could not stop.  I watched all 10 episodes and was just as memorized as I was watching the BOB series.      Now, this is not BOB2, \\"The Pacific\\" focuses on 3 Marines and their endeavors in the Pacific Theater, not a company of Airborne in the European Theater.  These two Theaters and the enemies that were fought were completely different. This series brings on a whole new look to the struggles and turmoil's that the Marines suffered.  This was about the mental trauma suffered as well as the physical.   This series was just as heart wrenching as BOB.    Finally, I hope that Hanks and Spielberg can come out with another great series like BOB and \\"The Pacific\\" but on the Navy.  How the Pacific was won with the great carrier and air battles.

B0014Z4OQG|2.0|The camera is irritating, the characters are annoying, and all they do is run around screaming \\"oh s*** oh s***\\" and \\"oh my god oh my god\\".  Seriously, I watched this with closed captioning and you could predict what the next caption would read.    The beginning of the movie drags with twenty minutes of boring dorks partying, then it consists of them lurching from one whammy to another while you hope for them to die.    The only thing that saves this from being one stars is that some money clearly went into the special effects.  It was entertaining to see New York City get smashed up.
0684803356|4.0|Of course For Whom the Bell Tolls is in English, but everyone speaks Spanish. Hemingway tries to create Spanish sounding English by stretching the syntax of English nearly to its breaking point, by rendering Spanish-ism into odd English phrases, like \\"what passes with thee?\\" for que pasa, a common Spanish greeting.     Hemingway also uses archaic English usages to present forms that exist in Spanish, but are gone from English, like thee and thou for the second person pronoun. It makes for strange but captivating reading. Here is a writer rendering English into Spanish forms. The results are startling and not always enjoyable; but it always gives you the impression that you have entered another world.     If the novel was written in more fluid English, the result would not have been so unusual. The very clumsiness of the language reminds the reader that this is a novel that is taking place in another, somewhat more formal language. And the English bears that imprint.     When we read For Whom the Bell Tolls we can see English both reaching into its past to create diction of current usage, as well as using an odd and foreign syntax to give the illusion of another language.  Often, this effect was criticized.  But an open reading of this novel shows what an effective technique this is and how well it does the heavy lifting of expressing another culture's values on the level of language from one tongue to another.

Number 14 on the disc \\"Make This Day\\" is by far one of the best on the CD. This song should have been released first as far as I am concerned. My grand daughters keep playing \\"Make This Day\\" over and over. Their ages are 3yrs and 10yrs old. They both know almost all the words to the song, even the 3yr old. My husband and I like it the best and we are in our mid 50's and my 82yr old mother has made it her favorite song. It just shows that the Zac Brown Band is loved by all ages.

Impeccable craftsmanship, solid melodies, catchy hooks and lyrics that will peak your interest.    I will go so far to say as a whole I probably enjoy Flamingo more than any Killer's album - It's that good.  Don't miss!

B004132HZS|4.0|\\"Sherlock\\" is an update of Sherlock Holmes created by Mark Gatiss and Stephen Moffat, both \\"Dr. Who\\" writers, that places the detective in contemporary times. Like the Holmes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation, this Sherlock is fascinated by science, deduction, and keeps up with the latest technologies. In Moffat's words, \\"He's not meant to be a relic of a bygone era. He's meant to be ahead of everybody else in the room.\\" He runs a web site called \\"The Science of Deduction\\". He keeps ongoing, rather gruesome, experiments in his fridge. He carries a cell phone. And, like Conan Doyle's Holmes, he knows and cares little about politics or popular culture.<br /><br />The first episode of the series, \\"A Study in Pink\\", takes inspiration from the novel that introduced Sherlock Holmes to readers in 1887, \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", right down to Dr. Watson's origins and the clue left by the murder victim. The new Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman) is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, just as the 19th century's Dr. Watson was a veteran of the Anglo-Afghan War. He is looking for a flat while Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) is looking for a flatmate. As for Holmes' character, the writers seem to have taken bits from Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and modernized them. Instead of smoking a pipe, Sherlock wears a nicotine patch(es), for example.<br /><br />Instead of simply being aloof, \\"Sherlock\\"'s writers have gone a step further and made Holmes a self-described \\"high-functioning sociopath\\". Although Sherlock is clearly thrilled at the prospect of a bloody crime spree in London, he's not really a sociopath. He just doesn't bother to hide his disinterest in people. He may fall somewhere on the shallow end of the autism spectrum, which is very 21st century indeed. But if Holmes were really a sociopath, he would be repulsive, so I'm not sure why the writers want to imply that he is. Then there is his brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss), who is some sort of high-ranking intelligence officer and puppeteer. He seems more the sociopath.<br /><br />Perhaps inspired by ongoing speculation on the part of Conan Doyle fans regarding the detective's lack of interest in women, \\"Sherlock\\"'s creators have chosen to make an issue of it. It's not clear whether the writers intend to imply that Sherlock is gay or only that his acquaintances assume he is. But the main effect of this ambiguity is to create humorous situations when everyone assumes the same of Dr. Watson. Humor is one of this series' strengths. I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, but the humor and fast pacing got me. Not the stories. \\"Sherlock\\" shares with most modern mysteries impossible plots and motive-less crimes. Those are its flaws. The three 90-minute episodes are:<br /><br />\\"A Study in Pink\\" introduces us to the new Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson with a serial killer case. Over a period of several months, three Londoners have died in unexpected suicides, all by taking the same poison pills. Foul play is suspected, and Detective Inspector Lestrade (Rupert Graves) is feeling pressure to solve the case. John Watson is an army doctor, veteran of the Afghan War, looking for a flatmate. He's introduced to an eccentric misanthrope, Sherlock Holmes, by an mutual acquaintance. Holmes is a \\"consulting detective\\" with amazing powers of deduction to whom Lestrad has reluctantly turned for help with this baffling case. His new flatmate Dr. Watson is sucked into the drama and is able to contribute his medical and military expertise.<br /><br />\\"The Blind Banker\\" finds Dr. Watson looking for a job, as his bills pile up. An old acquaintance asks Sherlock to investigate a break-in at a bank. The intruder spray-painted yellow graffiti on a wall, but no one could figure out how he got into the building. When one of the bank's traders is found dead in his apartment shortly after returning from a trip to China, and there is another death under similar circumstances, the trail leads Holmes and Watson to anunderground Chinese crime syndicate called the Black Lotus. But the new police detective on the job, DI Dimmock (Paul Chequer), is doubtful of Holmes' conclusions. And an expert in Chinese antiquities, Miss Soo Lin Yao (Gemma Chan), who might be able to help the investigation, has gone into hiding.<br /><br />Holmes and Dr. Watson aren't getting along so well in \\"The Great Game\\". And just as Holmes laments the lack of interesting cases, his block explodes. A mad bomber is playing a sadistic game that keeps the Holmes, Watson and DI Lestrade on the edge of their seats. The bomber gives Holmes a series of cases to solve, each time strapping a bomb to a hostage and allowing a number of hours to solve the mystery. If Holmes isn't quick enough, the bomb will explode. Holmes suspects the mind behind the bombs might be that of his rumored arch-rival, Moriarty. Meanwhile, Holmes' brother Mycroft is pestering him to track down a memory stick containing some documents vital to national security that went missing when a clerk at MI6 died.<br /><br />The DVDs (BBC/Warner 2010): Disc 1 contains \\"A Study in Pink\\", \\"The Blind Banker\\", and an audio commentary for \\"A Study in Pink\\" by producers Sue Vertue, Mark Gatiss, and Stephen Moffat, who also wrote this episode. They discuss the genesis of the series, finding modern equivalents, allusions to Conan Doyle's story, differences from the pilot, cast, characters, locations, sets. Disc 2 contains \\"The Great Game\\" and \\"Unlocking Sherlock\\" (32 min), a featurette that addresses modernizing Holmes, casting, shooting in London, the score, and the Watson/Holmes relationship. The 60-minute pilot episode that never aired on TV is also on Disc 2. It's a shorter version of \\"A Study in Pink\\".

0316069884|5.0|I thought this book was fascinating, I had a hard time putting it down! It should be required reading for everyone who eats meat. Jonathan provides a gruesome look into the realities of factory farming, how this impacts the health of the animals, which in turn influences our health and the health of our environment. Too many people are willing to turn a blind eye to the realities of how our food arrives in the supermarket and what chemicals, pharmecutical drugs and foodborne illnesses we are consuming as a result of the factory farming industry.     To his credit, he does not condemn meat eaters entirely and tries to give stories from people who are involved with humane and sustainable farming. These smaller farms give us a glimmer of hope that we can change things, but we have to be willing to pay attention and to pay more for a healthier and more humane product if we do choose to eat meat. Or we could cut down our consumption, or choose to abstain from eating meat entirely.    We should rightly consider the intelligence and social structure of fish, chickens, pigs and cows, and realize they are not any different from the family pets which inhabit our own homes. Farm animals should not be subject to acts of monstrous cruelty.     It's up to us now - we need to be willing to face the facts and change!
B003IPC5SO|4.0|Well being a Kylie Minogue fan will no doubt prompt you to buy this album. It returns her to that strictly dance-pop sound that she revolutionized with her 2001 album 'Fever' but with a little more. This album contains musical styles of obviously dance-pop as well as synthpop, euro-pop and euro-dance. This album has actually been critiqued however, as many feel it lacks a uniqueness about it. But I definately consider Aphrodite to be a very strong and consistent album for pop music lovers. Here's the tracks:    #1  ALL THE LOVERS - released as the first single. This song basically sums up most of the album and it direction. Kylie herself actually said that this song was one of the last to be recorded and that it was unanimous to release it first as it shapes the euphoria of the album.    #2  GET OUTTA MY WAY - a classic Kylie pop song and dance-pop at its finest. This was released as the second single and for some reason didn't do as well as hoped, yet nevertheless it is probably the best song on the album. It is a very fast paced catchy track with elements of synthpop included.    #3  PUT YOUR HANDS UP (IF YOU FEEL LOVE) - this song has a strong euro-pop/euro-dance feel to it. It is also a very up-temo song.    #4  CLOSER - this is a standout track. It is more mid-tempo than anything but it grabs you. Listening to this song will probably make you think about aliens and UFO's landing. It has those kind of intergalactic sounds throughout.    #5  EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL - this mid-tempo song is great because it has a kind of relaxing feel to it. Not as much dance to it but still brilliant and beautiful.    #6  APHRODITE - the title track is a fierce one. This song is catchy and like \\"Get Outta My Way\\" it stands out in its own way because it is more aggressive than the other tracks, both in lyrics and music.    #7  ILLUSION - a mid-tempo track that was written by Kylie. As much as i love when Kylie writes songs, this particular one never really grabbed me. It is a goodpop song but compared to the other tracks, it doesn't really have much there.    #8  BETTER THAN TODAY - this is definately one of the best on the album. This song is completely different from the other tracks because it has an acoustic country backing sound to it overlaced with synthpop. Catchy and effective. It is undoubtedly a standout and apparently is being released as the third single from the album.    #9  TOO MUCH - this is an ideal dance-pop song. quite energetic and catchy and was also written by Kylie and Jake Shears from the Scissor Sisters. This song generally sticks with you after you've finished listening to the album.    #10 CUPID BOY - at first I didn't think much of this song, but I since listened to it again and found it to be a standout track. It combines elements of dance-pop and synthpop. I think this song is very vital for the album.    #11 LOOKING FOR AN ANGEL - my least favourite track personally. I just don't think this song has that punch to it even though Kylie wrote it. It is catchy and is great dance-pop but nothing exceptional.    #12 CAN'T BEAT THE FEELING - a great dance-pop song to end the album on. Very up-tempo and catchy.    so Aphrodite is a very strong album and consistent to a point where you rarely have to skip through a song, and that makes worth purchasing.
B0048IMZMG|2.0|Okay, I like to start off saying that I have nothing against Ms. Swift. I respect her for achieving this much success as she did at her age. However, her music is dull. My sister bought the CD, and I heard the entire CD from start to finish. Now, she has catchy songs but her lyrics are nothing inspiring. Her melodies are very similar to her previous songs, and they tend to sound rather simple. There is nothing wrong with that, of course. Many classics are simple (i.e.\\"Something\\"-Beatles). Swift's music on the other hand, is awfully generic. For example, her more edgy song \\"Haunted\\" is a good track. A contrast to her prior hits, but again, after a few listens it gets old.     Normally, I do not write reviews for contemporary artists, but I felt compelled to do one for \\"Speak Now\\". I wanted to see why she's as popular as she is, and I guess it's just because she's everywhere. Additionally, I don't think she has any vocal range. I have seen her perform and it is not the best (or close) of performances. Take last year's Grammy performance with Nicks, it was dreadful!     Yes, I guess I must be inane, but this is my opinion and for those who claims this as legendary, timeless, classic music, you might have hit your head one time too many. Again, my opinion, do not attack me because it differs from yours.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Oh, but it is. A foreign, glorious planet that makes me want to sign up for my corset fitting and venture forth in one of those new-fangled locomotives. Set in the middle years of the Victorian Era, North and South is based on Elizabeth Gaskell's novel of genteel Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and her hate-respect-admire-love relationship with John Thornton (Richard Armitage, soon to be Thorin Oakenshield in the upcoming big-screen version of The Hobbit), a self-made cotton mill owner from the northern city of Milton, Gaskell's stand-in for Manchester. Repulsed from their very first meeting by Thornton's brutal beating of a mill employee, Margaret refuses to let go of her idealized vision of the people and manners of the South and accept Thornton for the blunt, ambitious, yet also honest and hardworking industrialist he is (Pride? Prejudice? What?) Supporting characters involved in Margaret and Thornton's tumultuous relationship include her well-bred and supportive parents (Tim Pigott-Smith and Lesley Manville), his haughty yet totally devoted mother (Sinead Cusack, brilliant) and an idealistic but grounded union leader (Brendan Coyle), whose daughter (Anna Maxwell Martin) Margaret befriends.  Numerous comparisons have already been made between 1995's BBC/A&E production of Pride and Prejudice and North and South, and while I'll not venture to explore which 19th century hero is more swoon-worthy (Landed country gentlemen? Hardworking industrialist? Oh, decisions!), there is a clear resemblance between the plot of Austen's novel and the plot of Gaskell's. That might be putting it lightly--I think it entirely possible that Ms. Gaskell opened her works of Jane Austen and said, \\"Hmm, how can I make this about industrialism?\\" They're that similar, right down to the--SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER--failed first marriage proposal. But who cares? It's such an engrossing plot that I daresay no one will mind, and the pacing is different in any case (If Pride and Prejudice is a lovely amble through the countryside, then North and South is a brisk trot through the cobblestoned streets of Milton.) Also, the world of Milton is far starker than anything Austen wrote about--in these cotton mills, you could lose dearer things than your reputation. For all the elegance and lovely period costumes, North and South never lets us forget how the other half lives, and that it was the toil of the \\"ordinary\\" people that made England prosperous during the golden years of Victoria's reign.   Whatever the outside similarities--or differences--are, if quality of production and overall excellence are your main concerns, then N&S is definitely on par with P&P (this in itself is a recommendation.) The production values are of the highest caliber, and there is not a weak spot in the cast. Sandy Welch (who did 2006's Jane Eyre, also very good) has crafted a breathtaking adaptation that is undeniably Victorian in nature while still being comfortably accessible to modern sensibilities. Oh, and did I mention the cast? Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe deserve all the praise they receive here and more. Savor these performances--this is acting to remember. If you are a fan of Austen, Dickens, Victorian literature in general, or Elizabeth Gaskell, get thee to a library/video store/Netflix and immerse yourself in this impeccable production.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|Get ready for Blair Witch 3...My wife borrowed this movie from the Library...thank God.  Yes, there was some suspense but I can't figure out why people are so scared. There are scooby-do episodes that carry more suspense and scare.  It was almost as lame as two people stranded at sea in \\"Open waters.\\"  People who feel that it is better to use your immagination in movies should go sit in a wet box.  With the overwholeming numbers of lame films hitting the market, overly marketed/hyped movies need to stay in the trash bin.  Go see House on Haunted Hill (new or old), 13 ghosts, Land of the Dead, 28 days later...almost anything is better (OK...it is better than Blair Witch 1or2).
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I've just started the book and am about a quarter of the way through it.  I just was checking to see if there were any reviews yet and of course it has a horrible rating because of the price, it is very annoying that people do that over the price. I am enjoying the book very much so I will give it 5 stars. I  am on my second kindle and yes I am very disappointed with the price but I am not going to punish one of my favorite authors for something he has no control over. I have started to buy hard covers again and I share them with friends. Please stop reviewing the price here,  it is really unfair to the people who want to know what others think of it. Ya know people who have actually bought the book and read it.

It's cute & I get a peak of the now 3 decades of her life that have intersected w/ the band she says wrote, the soundtrack to her YOUTH/LIFE... Yikes U sure start feeling old when U begin to hear the musical staples of your youth in the background of commercials to sell this and that... Seems Martin Gore is doing quite well for himself as of late, selling off a few gems of the back catalog to Madison Ave.... Nice to see this SELL OUT! (no pun intended) I mean this limited/deluxe set, sell out! Nice to see there remains an army of loyal DM fans out there to gobble these up!! Haven't heard \\"Dressed in Black\\" live in a while! Cheers! Its gonna be a fun evening! Rolling a 'medicinal' spliff right now :) BTW Great delivery service!!! Much Kudos to Amazon- I ordered this yesterday morning & w/ next day service got this today at 11:30 am!

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book very much. After not reading for awhile ie 7 yrs(for a reason) this book just kept me at it. I would be sitting up in bed, kindle on my lap, I would start dozing off and wake and continue reading. I only wish there was something else like it.   With a really good book, you never want it to end, but you know it has to.  To the author, thank you and you wrote this so realisticly, and you just make the reader fall in love with little Jack.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Celtic Woman's Songs from the Heart was a choice I made after listening to the samples offered. I love this feature! What a treat to hear snippets as a way to choose. I was torn between 3 CDs from these artists. The end result is sheer delight. I listen to it at night while falling asleep - brings a calm and positive close to whatever the day brought forth.    If you appreciate lilting sounds, pleasurable lyrics, even some you might not understand, as well as deeply satisfying resonant tones, I recommend you listen to the samples for this CD. The tunes offer a bygone feeling of romance, a far-off quality of fantasy and a genuine \\"sweetness\\" that seems to transcend the mundane into the higher sphere of awakening the divine nature of us all.

B000063DI9|4.0|Spring of 1988, I skipped school and was hanging out with my best friend at the mall.  We went into a record store (CD's were just getting popular so it was still a record store), and the blue sleeve of Iron Maiden's new album caught my attention out of the corner of my eye.  I was elated, not really expecting a new Iron Maiden album to come out so soon.  I had much of the earlier stuff-- Somewhere in Time, Live after Death, Killers and Iron Maiden, and was really excited to hear what they would do next. I without thinking, snatched up a tape immediately.    I had my cheesy yellow Sony Walkman with me, sat in the back of my buddies girlfriend's Volkswagen bug and ignored them to get through the first two songs on the tape, Moonchild leaving me floored with awe, and Infinite Dreams making my head enthusiastically wag to the rock-out part.  I was seventeen (disclaimer). Eric snatched the headphones from me wanting to hear it himself.  It was different, very different, and Infinite dreams had a complexity to it that was strange, like Revelations meets Black Sabbath's 'Planet Caravan,' sorta bluesy. I dug it.    Years later I still think the album is really good.  The instrumental parts are just brilliant, guitars shifting from metal riffing to twin harmonies and solos at perfect moments all over the steady melodic bass playing of Steve Harris.  We hear this on the vamp after guitar solos on Infinite dreams, as well as Seventh son of a Seventh son. It is definately a prog rock version of Maiden, but what's new after Rime of the Ancient Mariner really?  I mean how many times can those killer augmented minor key flourishes be used in songs with some epic backstory (Dune, Egyptian mythology, The Seventh Son...) before it gets played out.  Anyway, nice touches are the fading of out of a sorta staccato metal riff into a 4/4 medival style acoustic picking outro of The Clairvoyant-- Nicely done. The album does really well conceptually, the lines of the story hold up and are interesting.    Why not five stars?  I can't say this album beats Somewhere in Time only because to me SWIT is fierce-- The productions is big, Steve Harris and Nicko are big, Adrian and David's dueling is way on point, and Bruce is strong and in control.    In SSOASS, Bruce at times is just a growling away through verses, and even at times... damn...sorta pitchy.  Now I dont' really care, but listen to Somewhere in Time and you get a sense that it's all there-- and it's all electric, fluid and effortless.  Something is missing in Seventh Son of a Seventh son at times, and Bruce sounds like he is straining to get it back, or convince you that it is there not fading, aging. That strain is more evident in the next unfortunate collection of songs-No Prayer for the Dying. Blegh!    Still Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is the last great Iron Maiden album.  It is epic, to be played along with a good Rush or Pink Floyd album, and is absolutely still a joy to listen to.

1439148953|3.0|'Brooklyn' has such an excellent premise: young Irish woman emigrates to America in the early 1950s, finds life to be a struggle, and falls in love right before having to make a profound decision (..no spoilers).  Unfortunately the author fails rather badly in fully developing the characters; they all feel rather two dimensional.  And although his prose is generally adequate, I would have appreciated richer descriptions of both the time and place.  In no way did I feel like I was transported back to my hometown, Brooklyn.      Bottom line: great story not given justice by the author's pen.  Not recommended.
B00428CPUY|5.0|First off, I religiously keep up with these DVD's ever since the first edition in Texas.  Which still holds as the best one out of the 3, simply because This is Eric Claptons Event where you want him to SHINE.  He completely tears it up in the first Crossroads DVD on I shot the Sheriff, cocaine, and have you ever loved a woman.  The guitar solos never have sounded better on his Fender.  5 Star DVD    Now 2007 Crossroads in Bridgeview:  Somewhat very weak, eric doest want to be self-indulgent and barely solos with the same intensity he usually has.  John Mayer, Buddy Guy, Derek Trucks, and Jeff Beck the Show.  4 star DVD    2010 Crossroads in Bridgeview:  Great Mix of artisits- Although many of you were not at the actual event.  Let me say this- I had to actually leave the event early after standing for 12 hours and listening to BB KING ramble on for 35 minutes in the finale without just playing.  On a positive note, Gary Clark Jr. is a STUD just incredible musicianship and style.  The DVD did not have the memorizing Bass solo from the girl in Jeff Beck's band ( Prince's former bassist, I cant remember her name)  that highlight won me over, disappointing the dvd didnt capture that footage.  The Buddy guy, Ronnie wood, Johnny Lang set was easily the best highlight of the entire film- a must see.  What else was wrenching? Citizen Cope filling in or whatever he was doing- it was hard to watch in person-boring, nonchalant, and irrelevant.  ZZ sounded great, Midnight in Harlem with Derek truck and his wife excellent, and Mayer's rhythmic section in Aint no sunshine was top notch.
0446195529|2.0|Love Baldacci, too bad his Kindle pricing is ridiculously high. How can you justify charging Kindle users more for an elctronic version than a hard back? Will not buy this Kindle edition or any Kindle edition at this price. I will have to go back to paperbacks. Too bad. Amazon Wake Up before you get killed in the market place by less expensive alternatives. The Kindle is nice but not as great as you may think.
B0042JTAI8|5.0|Haven't read the book yet. Even so I'm giving it 5 stars ;-)    Got one question: What's the difference between this Kindle edition and the other Kindle edition that's not available in Europe? The former's print length has 320 pages, and the latter - 480, as far as I remember. Also, one came out in October, and the other in November. Just a little confused, that's all.
031603973X|5.0|I am a HUGE HUGE HUGE fan of Chuck Fischer's pop up books. I love pop up books in general. There was this awesome exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History in DC that focused on the history and different types of pop up books. I was thrilled to see one of Fischer's books as well as a video explaining the process of creating his wonderful works of art. I love his books because they're just like magic by bringing these scenes into 3D.<br /><br />If you ever wanted a book to get you into the holiday spirit, this is it. Immediately as soon as you open up the cover, the holiday classic jumps right at you. The pictures are absolutely gorgeous and really bring to life this classic holiday tale. My favorite is the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Personally this has always been my favorite Ghost throughout the entire story but seeing it in all its terror and glory was outstanding here. It's exactly how I pictured it to be and the presentation is haunting and magnificent.<br /><br />The only tiny blip was that one of the scenes can be easily missed because it's tucked inside of another scene. I almost didn't see it had it not been for me pondering why that certain page was thicker than the other pages. Since it's s tucked in and has to be manually opened, I suggest being quite fragile with it. The book is not something that has to be opened with gloved hands and put behind a glass case but I would recommend handling it carefully as not to tear the pop ups in anyway.<br /><br />Included with the book is the complete text of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, broken up in five booklets (including one with a nifty cover). This is nice because it breaks up the reading. There is also another booklet that talks about the impact A Christmas Carol has had on the world (mentions several different movie versions including my favorite, A Muppet Christmas Carol!) as well as a brief bio about Charles Dickens.<br /><br />As I've stated before with Fischer's other books, just because these are pop up books does not necessarily mean they are just for kids. These are stunningly beautiful, delicate works of art that can be admired and treasured by readers of all ages. This is a perfect book for the holidays. I think it would be wonderful to read aloud a part of the text of A Christmas Carol every night and stare in wonder at the magic come to life before your eyes.ese are pop up books does not necessarily mean they are just for kids.

0061714372|4.0|How Mustaine ever managed to be succesfull with that ugly and disjointed voice of him, it's a mystery. However, the music of Megadeth is breathtaking, in my opinion. So, I gladly bought this book.<br /><br />And I was not dissapointed. It's honest, fast paced, enjoyable. Yes, it suffers from a common characterictic of official rock biographies: he rarely speaks about the inspiration for the songs, the technical aspects of recording them, whatever. Apparently, people simply goes into the studio and record a great album...<br /><br />Other than that, however, it's a very good reading if you enjoy Megadeth. However, I have a doubt: I did not understand how, with the permanent changes of addresses, the selling of drugs, then the bands, the tours, etc, etc, he managed to be owner of three martial arts black belts and, according to him in the book, to become a sort of lethal weapon. When and how did he practice? Weird.
0312600844|1.0|I have not read all the reviews posted here, but wanted to add a note joining the negative ones; this book is a complete waste of time and a huge disappointment. In fact, it's maddening and I go to bed every night angry at the author. I'm a little better than 2/3 finished. The book starts off bad and goes downhill from there. Loser dialogue, supposedly \\"hipster\\" references that go flat, unlikeable, unsympathetic characters, and a whole lot of other drivel. Making it a shorter novel or a short story would not have improved anything--there is no part of the book that warrants attention. I'm too far in to it to give up, but at the same time I do not like honoring the book by finishing it.   There is a book shelf at a bar near my house--take a book, but replace it with something. Since I wouldn't dare pass this on to anyone I know and like, I'll put it in the bar and feel sorry for the sap who thinks he or she hit the literary jackpot.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I own every Doctor Who, currently on DVD and Blu-Ray, and have pre-ordered every disc to be released through February 2011 and the criticisms are spot on about this series.  Yes, Matt Smith is too young...Yes, the stories are fantastically impossible...Yes, it is not David Tennant, Christopher Eccleston or even Tom Baker playing the role, but that is exactly what Doctor Who is supposed to be!  It is supposed to be a fantastically impossible adventure featuring fantastically impossible people, starring a character who, periodically, fantastically transforms into an entirely new person.  Hello?!?!? This is fiction, not reality, and I feell like I've just gotten off a roller coaster as each of these episodes ends.  Who wouldn't love (SPOILER!) Winston Churchill using the most evil creatures in the Universe (Daleks) to fight the most evil man in history (Hitler) and then staging a \\"Battle of Britain\\" in space using Spitfires against the Dalek mothership...it's BRILLIANT! Yes, there are holes in the plot but every story, from Hartnell to Smith has them.  I grant you that, for the stark-raving lunatic fan who can quote you continuity from \\"The Aztecs\\" to \\"Tooth and Claw\\", this series may not be for you.  But for everyone, like me, who watches this show for the escapism, fantasy, fun, science and morality of it all, this is an essential part of your ever-growing Doctor Who library.
B00000G3I2|1.0|Having heard rave reviews for this film, I watched it with high expectations. Unfortunately, about halfway through I was thoroughly bored, and two-thirds of the way through, I hit fast-forward. Other than cult stuff, I would rate this as the worst movie I have seen.
0156012197|4.0|About a year ago someone suggested I read this book, for even though it was a book for children it supposedly included some profound life lessons for adults. I have to admit there was indeed some thought-provoking material in this book, not the least of which being that as adults we have lost track of the the \\"happy for no reason\\" little child we all once were at some point of our lives. It's a very nice little book that makes for worthwhile reading for both youngsters and oldsters as well.
B003VIW8DK|1.0|I listened to most of every track all the way through, one time. This is a rehash of the same crap he's been putting out since the late '80's. The beginning of the opening track is indeed just reused from one of those albums, Mamouna I think, and there is something vaguely irritating about that to me. The songs are just pasted together from digital samples, laid on thick like some disgustingly greasy, oversweet cake icing, all the flavors just plastered on top of each other, in order to make it sound \\"complex\\". It's really objectionable, lifeless and dreary, much ado about absolutely nothing at all. There is no wit here, just his same old pose: \\"world-weariness\\" and fake elegance, a kind of mindless \\"glamor\\" that doubtless constitutes his appeal to the more pretentious of the Tories of the baby-boomer generation. Women love this music because it's about \\"romance\\". God is it stupid. His time is over, certainly don't waste your money on this nonsense.
B0041CGP02|5.0|Yes, it's a GH album.  Yes, we have most of the songs.  Yes, \\"Cross Road\\" was also a GH album.  But don't knock these guys down... in pop music, it's a major feat to be able to have a decent hits compilation, nevermind two discs' worth of great music.  These are great songs from a great band.<br /><br />BONUS: The single-disc version (not this one) sold only at Target has two live tracks from NJ in July 2010, \\"Diamond Ring\\" and \\"We Weren't Born To Follow\\".
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Yes, I cried when I heard that Tennant was giving up the role as the Doctor. Hard. I was in love with David and his ridiculous hair and manga eyes and saying \\"Well...\\" and \\"I'm sorry...I'm so sorry...\\" and \\"Allons y\\" every ten seconds. I would also miss Russell with his epic endings and extraordinary plot twists. Then I saw the new actor for the Fifth Series and was immediately outraged (Why was he so young, and where the HELL were his eyebrows?). I wanted Ten back.    Someone told me that Steven Moffat would be taking over. At first, I was like, who the HELL is Steven Moffat? Wait...the guy who invented the Vastu Narada, Weeping Angels, and Captain Jack Harkness? There was hope for this series.     How long did it take me to admit that this was the best season of Doctor Who ever? One episode.     I immediately felt guilty about degrading Matt. I was totally in love with the eleventh Doctor, that \\"madman with a box\\". His witty comebacks (penned by the excellent Steven Moffat) and wiggly fingers and bow tie had me sold. Even the new TARDIS is spectacular. Don't even get me started on the companions. Amy Pond (a spectacular Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (slapstick Arthur Darvill) only add to the awesomeness of the Doctor while retaining their own grit and charisma.     Overall the season was wonderful, going off a fairytale theme as the Doctor, Amy (both young and old), and later Rory try to figure out the enigmatic cracks in time, the mythical Pandorica, the merely-whispered-of Silence, and who exactly River Song (an elusive Alex Kingston) really is, from Churchill to Van Gogh, Angels to Vampires, Star Whales to Dream Lords. The one reservation I would have is with the Silurian double episode (The Hungry Earth and Cold Blood). They seemed out of form with the rest of the episodes, more CSI than fairytale. I did enjoy the episodes though, I think that I would just have rather seen them with Tennant--they seemed more his style.     Moffat wrote five excellent episodes in the season, as was expected, but special note must be made to Amy's Choice (penned by Simon Nye) and Vincent and the Doctor (penned by Richard Curtis).    Go out and watch it, it won't disappoint.
0312370849|5.0|I thought that couldn't go through the book... it is about absolute tragedy, but I loved more & more as i read. The French descriptions are true and correct! Cried few times when I read! Waiting for the movie!
0684830485|4.0|Warning, this review gives away the very end of the book, so if you have not read the book, don't read this review.<br />So, first what I liked was just about everything. This was a well written, easy to read book. My edition was 470 pages, and I had it read in 2 days. The story sucks you in pretty well. I even was able to tolerate the romantic parts, and there are lots of them when Robert Jordan falls in love with the young lady Maria. Usually I roll my eyes and skip past the slop, but this was not too bad. The ending at the bridge was extremely well done. When I read about Robert Jordan down there planting his explosives, near panic because he still hears shooting up above, trying to calm himself down, it really did make my own heart beat a little faster. No book has done that to me in a very long time.<br />So here's what I didn't like. First, it seems like two-thirds of the book was a buildup to the attack on the bridge. After a while, I was thinking, get on with it, already. The big one, however, that ruined the book for me, was the last few pages. Robert Jordan blew up the bridge, reunited with what was left of his group, reunited with Maria, and was fleeing, when a tank shell knocked him off his horse and the horse collapsed on top of him, breaking his leg. Now, in this part, Maria is absolutely right. She wants to cut the load off one of the horses and throw Robert Jordan on its back. Sure, his leg was broken.. so what? That's a non-fatal wound. He wasn't losing any blood as far as I could tell from the text. Sure, he probably would have lost his leg, but so what? Better than losing his life. I really hate what he does here. He gives up. He drives Maria away, breaking her heart for life. Then he lies there with a gun, waiting for the enemy so he can go out in a blaze of glory.<br />Maybe Hemingway meant for this to be noble and heroic. Not for me. To me, it was stupid, unnecessary, and downright cowardly. You see, I'm not suicidal, and I can't get past the fact that this joker did not have a fatal injury. He could have lived and escaped. He had done his bit for the cause in blowing up the bridge. He had a woman (Maria) who loved him and was willing to marry him. He had a good, secure job waiting for him back in the States. The only downside for him is that he may have lost one leg. Big deal. To me, in throwing all that away and committing suicide, Robert Jordan ended up a despicable coward. His little suicidal ending may have killed one enemy officer. A suicidal ending like his is appropriate if you are inches from death; better to take one of them with you on the way out. But Robert Jordan was NOT near death! He just had a busted leg. So he's an idiot, and did not deserve Maria's love. The only possible benefit I can see is that maybe, IF he managed to kill that enemy officer, it allowed the group with Maria a little more time to get away. But they were all behind enemy lines anyway, so I'm not sure how much that matters.<br />So, to sum it all up, I really enjoyed this book up to the last few pages. I was so let down by that ending that I took a star off, and I give it 4 out of 5.his joker did not have a fatal injury. He could have lived and escaped. He had done his bit for the cause in blowing up the bridge. He had a woman (Maria) who loved him and was willing to marry him. He had a good, secure job waiting for him back in the States. The only downside for him is that he may have lost one leg. Big deal. To me, in throwing all that away and committing suicide, Robert Jordan ended up a despicable coward. His little suicidal ending may have killed one enemy officer. A suicidal ending like his is appropriate if you are inches from death; better to take one of them with you on the way out. But Robert Jordan was NOT near death! He just had a busted leg. So he's an idiot, and did not deserve Maria's love. The only possible benefit I can see is that maybe, IF he managed to kill that enemy officer, it allowed the group with Maria a little more time to get away. But they were all behind enemy lines anyway, so I'm not sure how much that matters.   So, to sum it all up, I really enjoyed this book up to the last few pages. I was so let down by that ending that I took a star off, and I give it 4 out of 5.

1444713043|4.0|Finally John Grisham writes a book for kids. And he does a great job with it!  Storyline about a kid named Theodore wanting to be a lawyer and then getting the opportunity to do so. The story moves quickly. There were a few points in the story where I thought the language and content may not have been appropriate but overall it was well written and engaging.
B002BFBAUG|4.0|Although it doesn't really have much new things to say, it is quite interesting and thoroughly engaging. Its surprising in a way that I was actually expecting a Superbad type of film or one of those raunchy teen comedies, although there's a lot of sex talk and all those typical of a coming-of-age comedy, I thought the movie was effective in portraying the characters in a realistic way and the script was at least clever and interesting. I would have wanted the move to dig deeper into the relationship of the main characters, but probably not making it more complex is the movie's appeal. I think the emotional hook for me is the lead character's failed European trip; that alone brought back lots of great memories.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|UNSTOPPABLE<br /><br />STARRING: Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Kevin Dunn, T.J. Miller, Ethan Suplee and Kevinn Corrigan<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Mark Bomback<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Tony Scott<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 12 November 2010<br />Review Date: 09 November 2010<br /><br />Unstoppable is the perfect title for a Denzel Washington flick because that is exactly what he is. He simply doesn't make bad movies and his performances are always riveting and dead-on. And if you were to surround him with the talents of Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson, you really couldn't go wrong.<br /><br />Director Tony Scott has done just that with Unstoppable, marking it as his impressive 16th feature film and fifth collaboration with Denzel. From Top Gun and Days of Thunder to Beverly Hills Cop II and The Taking of Pelham 123, who better to direct an action picture based on true events of a runaway train carrying tons of deadly chemicals, than Tony Scott?<br /><br />That's the plot and you know the actors so let's meet the characters. Denzel plays Frank; a single father to two teenage daughters working their way through college by waiting tables at Hooters. Don't trouble yourself; Denzel makes the joke for you. I'm just curious if Hooters paid Fox or if Fox paid Hooters? Frank has been working in a rail yard for 28 years and today he's got a new partner.<br /><br />Chris Pine plays Will - said partner, and the two don't hit it off so well at first. Frank is old school and Will is new school and there's no teacher around to make sure they play nice. It's just them and us in the cockpit of their train for the majority of their screen time. Don't think we spend the entire film stuck in a conductor box with these two though because we don't; they're not on the runaway train by the way.<br /><br />The train has runaway (is it just me or does the term runaway train just sound funny?) due to the incompetence of two idiots played by two funny and good actors whom I'll save for you. Their boss Connie, played by the lovely Rosario Dawson, must clean up their mess, serving as mediator between them, other employees, Frank and Will, an inspector, and her stiff corporate A-hole of a supervisor, Galvin (Kevin Dunn).<br /><br />Galvin is more concerned with the potential financial tragedy of a `train wreck' as the beast is half a mile long (a lot of money folks), than he is with the moral dilemma of how many lives will be lost should a wreck occur. The train has to go somewhere and it's headed straight for a big town; of course. Frank, Will and Connie aren't having it though because they're the good guys after all; so they devise a plan to earn that title.<br /><br />Unstoppable is about a train on the loose - but it's good, fast, funny and fun.s Connie, played by the lovely Rosario Dawson, must clean up their mess, serving as mediator between them, other employees, Frank and Will, an inspector, and her stiff corporate A-hole of a supervisor, Galvin (Kevin Dunn).

B0015DROBO|3.0|Intriguing storyline but seems to bounce too much between a factual recount and a fictional novel. Had me interested until about 2/3 the way through but started to lose steam as the story takes on a second life and ends somewhat abruptly, and predictably.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|One of the best television series to come along in a quite a while. I got into this about a season after it started but now am hooked. In this first season, you meet Don Draper the slick ad guy as well as a host of secondary characters each of whom are engaging in their own right. You really have to talk to an ad person from the 60's to appreciate how well the directors captured the essence of what it was like to work on a Madison Avenue ad agency in those days.  Stuff you could never get away with today--calling the secretary the \\"girl\\" and drinking whiskey and smoking in your office every few hours.  Quite an amazing series that is highly recommended particularly to anyone who has ever had the opportunity to work with a big ad agency.

B000VYX8PE|5.0|In my opinion, one of the most underrated kids series out there.  The series starts with the Beaudelaire kids' learning of their parents' death in a terrible fire and thus begins a story that plays out over 13 (some say 14) volumes with a ton of twists and turns and very scary moments.  The great thing about this series is that parents can read along with their kids as it is enjoyable for all ages and has a ton of very funny lines.  Very much a worthwhile series to get your kids into.
0312600844|5.0|You probably already know about him. Time Magazine has recently published his picture on its cover, calling him the \\"Great American Novelist.\\" I have just finished reading Jonathan Franzen's new novel, Freedom, and my visceral reaction was: WOW! Which led me to think about the importance of the WOW! factor: not just in Franzen's novel, but in contemporary fiction in general.<br /><br />Let me preface my remarks by stating the obvious: it's not easy to publish literary fiction in this country. Literary fiction writers like Jonathan Franzen, Wally Lamb, Jeffrey Eugenides and a handful of others have to compete in the publishing world with brand name authors: political personages like Sarah Palin or pop celebrities like Madonna, who generate controversy and attract media coverage, which in turn boosts book sales. They also compete with genre fiction writers, such as Stephen King or J.K. Rowling, who provide entertainment for the general public. But literary fiction also remains, above all, an aesthetic genre. At its best, it delivers strong characterizations, an individual style--as unique as the fingerprints of its authors--psychological depth, cohesive, well-balanced structures and outstanding plots, full of twists and surprises.<br /><br />Furthermore, literary fiction is not easily digestible: it requires a lot of patience, thought and, since such novels probe into our natures and motivations, a not always pleasurable introspection.  Which is perhaps why -along with poetry and independent films-literary fiction tends to get great critical reviews but doesn't usually sell well. So when an author manages to write literary fiction that is top-notch quality and appeals to the general public, the only way I can explain this magic is through that je ne sais quoi, the WOW! factor.<br /><br />Granted, Jonathan Franzen had a lot going for him: Ophrah's attention (the mere presence in Oprah's Book  Club makes any book sell well); an outstanding literary agent (Susan Golomb) and the support of a publisher who is known for publishing top literary fiction (Jonathan Galassi, the publisher of Farrar, Straus and Giroux). But talking about all of this \\"cultural capital\\" in Franzen's corner really begs the question. Because his new novel wasn't chosen at random: it really deserves  the endorsements it gets.<br /><br />Freedom is, first of all, a family epic. It traces the lives of two generations of Americans: Patty and Walter Berglund and their children, Joey and Jessica. The novel offers a masterful sketch of two eras in American culture, not just the portrait of a family. For additional interest and spice, there's the drama and tension of a love triangle. Patty becomes infatuated with her husband's best friend, the renegade musician, Richard Katz. In its vivid portrayals of the love story between Patty and Walter and the affair between Patty and Richard, Freedom shows us the difference between infatuation--with its long-term obsessions and explosive, but short-lived sexual excitement-and love, with its combination of loyalty, disappointment and real-life challenges.<br /><br />The novel's tension is maintained not just by the drama of the plot, but also by the depth and balance of its characterizations. The main characters function as each other's foils: the moral, straight-laced Walter is a foil for Richard Katz, the egotistic musician, whose outlook reminds me of Ivan's famous saying in The Brothers Karamazov: \\"But it has always happened that the more I hate men individually the more I love humanity.\\" Similarly, Patty, the competitive housewife prone to depression is counterbalanced by her pragmatic, even-keeled daughter, Jessica. Finally, the doting, self-effacing neighbor's daughter, Connie, functions as the perfect complement and foil to the outgoing and self-confident Joey. Their youthful love story reveals the perfect match between idolizer and idol, which could prompt many a psychologist to analyses of the workings of narcissism andco-dependency, but which also remains more touching and unique than popular psychology. The characterizations in this novel are so compelling that it's as if the author immersed himself into mindset of each character, a process reminiscent of Flaubert's saying, \\"Madame Bovary, c'est moi!\\" Which brings me to my initial point: Freedom definitely captures the WOW! factor. For me, the WOW! factor happens when a writer  appeals to  the greatest number of readers without sacrificing anything in quality (characterization, plot, structure or style).<br /><br />As a  fiction writer and literary critic, I've been an avid reader of contemporary fiction for a long time. Novels like Franzen's Freedom, which magically combine mass appeal with aesthetic qualities, remind me of why if you make it as a novelist in the U.S., you make it internationally.  To keep afloat in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, American publishers demand  mass appeal  from all of their  writers.  Meeting the highest aesthetic standards, as Franzen's Freedom does, is just an added bonus:  that unforgettable yet unmistakable WOW! factor.<br /><br />Claudia Moscovici, Notablewriters.comore touching and unique than popular psychology.

B003UESJF6|4.0|Part of what makes \\"Megamind\\" so enjoyable is that it's both an homage to and a parody of \\"Superman.\\" In this version, not one but two doomed planets send a newborn son to Earth. One can fly, has super strength and suave good looks, and, after his pod crash lands on the property of a wealthy couple, is destined to become a superhero. The other has blue skin, a bulbous head, a fish-like minion encased in a glass ball, and, after his pod crash lands within the confines of a prison, is destined to become a villain. We follow this villain, who has called himself Megamind, as he gradually realizes that maybe - just maybe - there's more to him than merely being bad. Perhaps it was merely a phase, an unhealthy outlet for his jealously at being teased and neglected during his formative years.    This may not be the most original computer animated film of our time, but it certainly is one of the most compelling. It's also one of the funniest; I think I laughed harder during \\"Megamind\\" than during any animated film released this year, and this includes highly enjoyable fair such as \\"Toy Story 3,\\" \\"How to Train Your Dragon,\\" and \\"Despicable Me.\\" It follows in the footsteps of most new releases, both animated and live action, by being released in 3D. While I still feel that the process is overhyped, overused, and overrated, there are select moments when it proves itself adequate (it so rarely makes a movie great). \\"Megamind\\" is a perfectly adequate 3D film; I can't say that I felt completely immersed, but I certainly enjoyed gawking at the action, the textures, and the shapes. That being said, all that would have just fine to look at in 2D, so if you have the choice, save yourself the extra cash - and yet another pair of 3D glasses.    And now for the plot. Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) has for years been the archenemy of Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt), a goody-two-shoes Superman caricature who defends the citizens of Metro City. Despite being well-crafted, Megamind's evilschemes have all been foiled, and by now, it has gotten to the point that they no longer carry any weight - least of all for Metro City's star news reporter Roxanne Ritchi (voiced by Tina Fey), who has been kidnapped by Megamind more times than she can remember.    On the day a museum opens in honor of Metro Man, Megamind appears to achieve the impossible by defeating his rival and taking control of the city. He's happy about this, but only at first; after a while, it seems that, without a hero to battle against, his life has absolutely no meaning. Using technology of his own invention, he creates a new adversary, hoping it will help him relive his glory days as a criminal mastermind. Here enters Roxanne's cameraman, Hal Stewart (voiced by Jonah Hill), who's transformed from a pudgy computer nerd into a muscular superhero named Tighten (apparently a spoof of the word \\"titan\\"). Hal hopes to use his new abilities to woo Roxanne, who he has always had a crush on. Unfortunately, Roxanne is already dating someone else, and of that, I will say no more.    In due time, Tighten devolves into Metro City's newest enemy. With Metro Man out of the picture, it seems the only hero the city has left is Megamind. Does he have it in him to be a defender of the people? The answer lies in a strange but appropriate skewing of a line Aaron Eckhart delivered in \\"The Dark Knight\\": \\"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\\"    It's practically a guarantee that children will enjoy this movie. It has a lot of action, the sight gags are plentiful, the colors are bright, the 3D is noticeable, and some of the dialogue is just silly enough to hold their attention. But adults will enjoy this movie, too. One of the funniest subplots involves Megamind's ability to disguise himself with a series of holographic projections, controlled by a wristwatch-like mechanism; as he trains Hal into becoming a superhero, he transforms himself in a short, stocky send-upof Marlon Brando as Jor-El, complete with a hilariously pronounced lisp. I also enjoyed the parody of Shepard Fairey's \\"Hope\\" poster, made famous during Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. Let's just say that the phrase, \\"Yes, We Can,\\" no longer applies.    This is, in short, a highly enjoyable animated comedy that everyone will enjoy. There is, in fact, only one thing about \\"Megamind\\" I took issue with: A brief but disturbing shot of Metro Man juggling three babies before tossing them back to their star-struck mothers. One of them lands in his mother's arms upside down. Even within the context of a family-friendly cartoon, this pushes the limits of what is and isn't acceptable. Fortunately, the scene is saved when, immediately afterwards, Metro Man casually walks on water. I may be reaching too far, but this could be yet another reference to \\"Superman,\\" which was in part a biblical allusion to God sending Jesus to Earth for the benefit of mankind. The difference, of course, is that neither Jesus nor Superman would ever shout out, \\"And I love you, random citizen!\\"
030726999X|5.0|I stumbled upon this triology a few weeks ago at a friends house. She asked if I wanted to watch a movie and put in \\"The Girl with the dragon tattoo\\". Wasnt paying attention until the main character tied up the guy and tortured him. It caught my eye and I had to find out more. Found the second book at work and fell in love. I couldnt stop reading it. I brought the last book the Hornets nest and I just got lost in it. The triology had everything, horror, suspense, drama, somwhat romance, action on every page. I'm very selective in what I read so this was a bonus to have three books that keep you going from the first page of the first book to the last page of the third book. I must warn certain parts do get a little boring cause he's explaining things but other than that buy the books. You wont regret it, good read for vacation, work or just alone time.

B003Z2LAAO|1.0|We saw this at our local Science Center Imax Theatre.  We have seen many wonderful 3-D movies there.  This was average 3-D footage and the content was boring and nothing but environmental preaching.  I was upset that we had gone there for a fun outing and I walked out feeling like I was \\"taken\\".  Since I don't live in the area that was filmed, I have no idea whether there is any substance to the producers' claims, but I don't like walking in to something like this without knowing it.  We haven't been to another Imax film there since this experience.  It was draqgy (like so many Redford films).  There are so many other wonderful 3D or Blue Ray movies out there (with wonderful scenes of nature), I would certainly not recommend this one.

1400079144|1.0|I did not enjoy this book.  It started out with promise, and I was looking forward to a few hours of fun reading, however things quickly went south.  There are many flaws, as other reviews pointed out, here is what drove me crazy with the book and prompted me to write a review, which I only do if I feel strongly positive or negatively about something.    The good: Some interesting facts about Washington DC architecture, art and Masons.  It made me want to jump in the car with the book in hand and explore some of the sites he talked about.      The bad: The characters are two dimensional and I feel like I have read them all before- nothing original at all- the brilliant, beautiful woman, the kind, benevolent wealthy man, the wise, blind priest who points the hero in right direction.  Also for such an \\"action packed book\\" it felt like it was moving slow, getting bogged down in repetitive conversations and explanations.  Langdon goes thru the book saying basically the same thing every few pages.     Person A:  \\"Well what about THIS particular map/ sign/symbol/clue/legend?\\"  Robert Langdon:  \\"I simply can't believe it.  It is meant figuratively, not literally!  Person A:  \\"but such and such PROVES it is literal.  RL.  \\"!!!!!!\\"  Oh, my bad.      Repeat the ENTIRE book up until the last few pages.      The UGLY:  ******SPOILER*******  The ending was just so stupid.  Look I know you need to suspend disbelief when you read, and it is often no problem, I just enjoy getting lost in a book.  In this book though, I kept getting yanked out of the story due to the stupid, illogical way people are acting!  Completely unbelievable!   The reveal of the \\"secret word\\" was lame- really, people were risking their lives and getting killed because there is a bible buried in the cornerstone of the Washington Monument?  Really?  Also, Peter is kidnapped, his hand is cut off, and he is tortured using sensory deprivation that makes you think you are dead.  Katherine is cut and bleeding, and is half dead from blood loss when she is rescued.  Robert is beat up, tasered and also put in the sensory deprivation and thinks he is dead.  There are also several dead bodies here and there as well, with a full CIA investigation and SWAT team on site.  The bad guy is finally killed and revealed to be Peters son.  Sounds like a lot to take in, right?  Peter, Katherine and Robert probably need a hospital visit at least, a good nights sleep, and maybe a good therapist to deal with some of the emotional trauma they suffered.  Nope, apparently not.  Peter feels good enough to take Robert on a tour of the Washington Monument and give him a lecture on Masons mere hours after he was tortured and almost killed by his own son.  His hand is cut off?  Oh well, he will go to the hospital AFTER the trip up the Monument, and only after Robert asks him to. Katherine?  Oh, she just needed a bag or two of fluid, that fixed her right up.  Her nephew almost killed her and her brother?  Who cares, her research was saved!!!  This makes her SO HAPPY she has to run right out to check it mere moments after the CIA arrive with her brother.   She felt so good, she and Robert took a tour of the Capitol the rest of the night and watched the sun come up.      Don't bother reading this book, or if you do, get it from the library like I did.  I am SO happy I didn't spend money on this!
B003DEMV1Q|5.0|This album is great, probably my favorite album. It is different from his other albums, a lot more pop mixed in with the R&B. I think if you are expecting an album like his older ones than you may be disappointed. Making Love, Hey Daddy, There Goes My Baby, OMG, and Guilty are the best songs on the album in my opinion.

The best part is that I get the lcd feature of the higher end keyboard on a better device. I had the g11 but never really used the g keys because the layout just wasn't appealing or convenient enough. Get this controller.
B003XKAZKO|4.0|Paper packaging, but glossy and sturdy. Booklet is hevy glossy stock, with some great photos.<br /><br />I read these first reviews and was worried, and after getting the CD I'm happy. Would I have like a 24 page booklet? Sure. But It's 8 pages and it's nice.<br /><br />Seems Morrissey is varying the style of repackaging these rereleases. Maladjusted, Southpaw, and now this one, are all very different in build. Would I prefer 3 standard jewelcases? Personally, No.<br /><br />Sound quality is fantastic, with 6 solid bonus cuts. I recommend to fans. Don't let the first reviews scare you off.
B002HPKYH0|4.0|I think the book is good.  It would be nice if everyone in the world could take this test and wear their skills on a little button on their shirts.  This way we could have better understanding of how to approach people and communicate to them.  I think the results confirmed my own suspicions of my strengths.  I am having my college aged kids take this test to help them decide their life's course.  I do think the basic premise of working mostly on your strengths is correct.
0316017922|5.0|\\"Outliers\\" by Malcolm Gladwell, a fascinating book with an entirely new perspective of the how and why individuals succeed in school, business, life.     I downloaded the audiobook version of \\"Outliers\\" from local library, Gladwell reading... he should have hired a pro... compared to another audiobook \\"The Alchemist\\" by Paulo Coelho, with Jeremy Irons reading.

B00428CPUY|5.0|Crossroads 2010 is around four and a half hours of pure great guitar playing, filmed nearly perfectly, with fantastic sound. This is an amazing concert film.<br /><br />I was at Crossroads 2010; the really great parts of the concert are here on this DVD. The really low points were gratefully left off, namely Citizen Cope and Johnny Winter (Winter was virtually carried on stage, and was so far out of tune and rhythm, Derek Trucks had to rescue him). November 9, 2010 is the release date of this DVD, any reviews prior to that date are simply conjecture on what may or may not be on this DVD, and are likely about the theatrical release of this film. I would also say that the Best Buy bonus disc is not worth chasing after. Another reviewer mentioned the songs included those were all my least favorite performances of the day, and mostly belonged on the cutting room floor anyway. Behind the scenes footage, during the standard four and a half hours there is just enough behind the scenes shown. The talking head pieces are more than enough for my taste. I'm not interested in more.<br /><br />There are thirty performances on this two disc DVD. Every guitarist is famous in one circle or another; these are big names in the industry. Yes, Eric and BB are the best known. The sound choice on the DVD is simple - straight stereo for the purist or DTS surround. Both sound great. The sound mix was done to perfection. They chose to package this DVD in the old DVD-Audio cases, slightly larger than a CD case, and with a snap shut mechanism to open.<br /><br />This is concert coverage at its best. Camera movement is kept to a minimum, shots are steady, rarely is focus missed, and there aren't a million short cuts trying to follow the music or tons of cuts back to crazy hippie dancers in the audience. The film tries very hard to let the music speak for itself and focus on the performers. Unfortunately there are a number of interviews or talking head moments in the film. About half are good and informative, the rest are really annoying. Sadly there was some voice over during performances by Sonny Landreth, Bert Jansch, and Earl Klugh. In a way, the editor is saying, folk music, jazz, and instrumental is boring, he needed to spice things up with commentary. The film opens with a hokey drive around Chicago in an old convertible. I would have preferred one more song instead of this lead in.<br /><br />Every Bill Murray introduction is included. At the concert, Bill was hilarious. On DVD, I'm not sure he is that funny. The finale, which felt like fireworks to me, was cut short. BB King and around twenty guitarists played Sweet Home Chicago - the sound was amazing.<br /><br />There is a huge difference between sitting one hundred yards away, listening to the PA mix, and the fine intimate clear mix the film captured. Some energy was lost in the mixing, but mostly clarity of the voices was hugely improved.<br /><br />My highlights for the day - Sonny Landreth, Robert Cray, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Keb' Mo', Jeff Beck (his new bassist is amazing), and BB King. By far the highest energy performance of the day was Buddy Guy. He was lit up that day, and it shines through on the DVD. The lowest of the low, Johnny Winter, Citizen Cope, Jimmie Vaughan (I despised his horning in on Robert Cray's performance when Hubert Sumlin pointedly says Robert is going to do this next song), and ZZ Top (at the concert they phoned in their performance, it was impossible to hear any vocals - in the remix for the DVD that was corrected). And I know this is heresy, but Eric Clapton did not perform very well during his set. He was outstanding when he sat in with other performers. But when it came time to do his set, his voice seemed very tired and that he just wasn't into the performance. I saw Clapton a few years ago and had a similar feeling.<br /><br />DVD Number one, roughly the first half of the concert, opens with Sonny Landreth demonstrating that he is an incredible guitarist. There are so many close ups of him working the strings and frets, there is a major guitar lesson in there. The Robert Randolph & Family Band play some great slide guitar - Joe Bonamassa steps in for one song. Robert Cray with Hubert Sumlin and the awful Jimmie Vaughan (The Famous Thunderbirds and Stevie Ray's brother) perform two songs. ZZ Top follows up with two songs each - on disc these are nice, in the concert they were terrible. Doyle Bramhall II is involved in the next four songs. Sheryl Crow leads a bunch of artists for two songs - the saving grace is Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi. Bert Jansch is apparently a fantastically popular folk singer in Great Britain. He sat in a chair center stage with his acoustic guitar. His playing is impressive, but he was a significant buzz kill at the concert. One of his songs is represented here. Stefan Grossman and Keb' Mo' are spectacular doing some very quite simple blues. Keb' Mo' is an artist to listen to, he is amazing. Then there are two songs by the most confusing performer at this concert, Vince Gill. Fortunately, he was backed by some amazing guitarists. The talking head moments with Vince are mostly about how he isn't sure he belongs at this concert. Yes Country music arrives at a guitar concert. On the DVD the two songs are not bad. Earl Klugh turns in two amazing classical guitar jazz pieces. Klugh is a master on the guitar. Like Gill and Jansch, his music didn't blend well with the rest of the show. And finally, the most controversial artist of the day, closes out disc one with two songs. I hate John Mayer as much as the next person; he is a slime bucket extraordinaire. I've always hated the grimaces he makes on stage, mostly can't stand to watch him, and can't figure out why BB King even bothers with this nut. But, if I close my eyes and forget that this performance is John Mayer, he does an amazing job at this concert.<br /><br />Disc two is the real gem in this DVD set. Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi are incredible. I love Susan's voice and her guitar playing. She carries the blues in a totally different fashion from all other female blues players. She's not the belt it out Koko Taylor type, but the subtle clean delivery. Thankfully the Trucks family was well represented on disc two. Warren Haynes does some great guitar playing and vocals. Los Lobos guys show up. The first five songs are just some great collaborative playing by great musicians. As the corner is turned to the last part of the disc, Bill Murray does his best introduction of the day. He essentially says, they got rid of the lousy bands, they're all in the bus and leaving, now it's time for only the good stuff. Well heck yes!!! Buddy Guy comes out swinging for two songs. I love the moment when Guy breaks a string (slow motion is so great on a DVD), Ronnie Wood tries to give him his guitar, Guy keeps singing and playing, and finally he's presented with his signature white and black polka dot guitar. Instantly he was off playing. I yelled Buddy Guy at the concert until I couldn't speak anymore. Today, I yelled it in my living room. Buddy Guy! Then Jeff Beck plays two amazing songs. His new group is fantastic. His new bass player isn't nearly as cute as his previous one. I'll take strong great bass player any day over a perky young Australian player.<br /><br />Eric Clapton performs on the next seven songs. The Citizen Cope collaboration was the worst track of the entire two disc set - Hands of the Saints was pure listening pain for me. Dear Mr. Fantasy with Steve Winwood was so remarkable to me. Other artists tried some Jimi Hendrix songs (thankfully those massacres were left off the DVD), Winwood and Clapton did a decent job on Voodoo Chile.<br /><br />By far the absolute best performance of the day was BB King sitting down with Lucille (oh the close ups of him playing are spectacular), Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, and Jimmie Vaughan to play The Thrill is Gone. Roughly fifteen minutes long, the song ends with all the guitarists still in the house playing along. It was a magic moment. Granted the director had to decide when to stop. However, in the concert BB goes on to tell a good ten minute story about women, and then the entire group of thirty or so musicians, did a twenty minute Sweet Home Chicago. I honestly felt like they had lit off fireworks it was that amazing.<br /><br />Given the difficult choices of the music to include in a very long concert, I think the director did a very fine job capturing the feeling of the day. This is by far much better than the previous Crossroads DVD. For over four hours today, I relived that incredibly hot day in Chicago. This was my fourteen year old son's first rock concert ever.

B000001G5H|5.0|Chopin's music is from the Romantic period in classical music. His 12 Etudes, Op. 10, and 12 Etudes, Op. 25 were composed during the 1820s-1830s. These are some of my favorite works by Chopin. All of these are performed with great piano playing by Maurizio Pollini.
0441018866|4.0|My first Alastair Reynolds novel, I found this to be a pretty good stand-alone space opera that avoids some of the usual tropes of the genre. Humans are alone in the galaxy -- the many civilizations populating the galaxy are far future posthumans evolved from the original human race. There is no FTL travel; humans spend literally hundreds of thousands of years touring the galaxy in sub-light ships of immense size.<br /><br />House of Suns begins with an attempt to wipe out the Gentian line by mysterious attackers. The search for the identity and motives of their adversaries leads to the uncovering of a conspiracy that is literally millions of years old.<br /><br />It has a great epic scope (millions of years, thousands of light years), but the characters themselves never really interested me much, and the rise and fall of interstellar civilizations failed to catch me up in an epic sweep of events -- instead, the finale is a long, long starship chase.<br /><br />I enjoyed it quite a bit, and will probably try something else by Reynolds, but it didn't quite hit the \\"Wow\\" level for me.

0446195529|4.0|Oliver Stone is recruited by the President of the United States to help serve his country on a top secret mission. In exchange for his services, Stone will never have to worry about the government knocking on his door again. The offer is too good for Stone to refuse.<br /><br />Stone is standing outside in Lafayette park, outside of the White House, enjoying his last night before he heads out of the country. High dignitaries are heading to their cars after being wined and dined at a dinner honoring the British Prime Minister. Suddenly, everything turns to disaster when a bomb goes off. Stone wakes up in the hospital. Due to the high nature of this threat the FBI, Secret Services, and the Camel Club are all working on solving the case.<br /><br />It was great to see the Camel Club together again in action. Everyone brings something new to the table. Stone is the ultimate action hero. He dishes out the butt-kicking and always leaves a trail of bodies in his wake. Right from the beginning I was fully mersed into this book. I could not get enough of Stone. The dynamics between Stone and the rest of the characters were nice. They all worked well together. Everyone equally measured up to the story line. I kept trying to figure out who the rat was in the story and every time I would start to think it was so and so, another twist was get thrown my way. There was not a moment that I was not enjoying myself reading this book. The suspense levels were high. The ending was great. I can not wait to read the next Stone novel. Hell's Corner delivers the action and punches!
B0045JK6G0|2.0|As a long time romance reader, I know these are not the best written in the world but there is a spark about Bella, Edward, and Jacob that shines through. I gobbled the four books up in a row. Imagine my surprise when I started getting bored halfway through the fourth. I believe Meyer jumped the shark after the baby was born. The book was no longer a romance but rather a superhero showdown. I tried explaining it to my husband how it was all about introducing these new vampires each with their special powers for the final showdown. He said \\"like Pokemon?\\" I said exactly. What makes romance, or women's fiction, work is the relationships between the characters and their development. This was just a stupid mishmash and the baby's freaky growth was artificial and unnecessary. Meyer should have just ended it after Bella's transformation and Jacob's happy ending.  I don't hold it against her to have a happy ending. That is what romance readers want.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Going along with Portia on her journey through her eating disorder helped me realize my own and how to heal from it. Her story echoed my own, which resonated deeply and startled me. I thought I was reading because I liked Portia de Rossi. Instead, she showed me how what I'm doing would only inevitably lead to the destruction of my body, not the \\"healthy, normal\\" body I wanted. Thank you, Portia. Your recovery began mine.     This book isn't written on a pedestal or a soapbox. It's written instead as a journey of one woman. She's not lecturing. She's revealing a very personal wound. I applaud her for her bravery and honesty.

B0045NXMJE|4.0|Many people will dismiss this film as \\"more of the same\\". But when \\"the same\\" is a film by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, that's more than OK, in fact it's an exercise in creative film making. Here Jeunet uses his quirky signature style to tell the tale of Bazil whose father was killed by a land mine and who himself has a bullet lodged in his head from a freak accident. With the help of a bunch of misfits, he seeks revenge on the arms dealers and manufacturers with hilarious results.<br />This is not \\"Amelie\\" - I don't think Jeunet will ever surpass that - but it's a well made, fun film that you just can't help but watch. Much of the comedy comes and goes in split seconds, so keep your eyes open wide.<br />Danny Boon is wonderful as Bazil and he is supported by the usually zany assortment of Jeunet loonies- who maybe aren't so loony after all. There's alot of logic and truth hidden in all of them.<br />I have the Canadian DVD issue which has been around since September and it is an absolutely beautiful widescreen print that does justice to Jeunet's muted color schemes.<br />You may like or hate this movie, but once you start you'll keep watching just to see what Jeunet will do next.
B0021L8V1Q|2.0|You can't fault Iron Man 2 for not being pretty. The movie looks awesome if you can stay awake for the whole thing. Amazingly there is almost no action throughout but if I focus on that I'll just be repeating what a hundred other reviews have already said. My bigger problem is with the main plot. The movie opens with Tony Stark MC'ing `Stark Expo' and basically coming off like a rich arrogant jerk. We then cut to Ivan Vanko, a heavily scarred and tattooed Russian living in poverty who sets off to build his own super suit to take revenge on Tony Stark for um.... well, something that supposedly Stark's dad did to his dad but I don't remember it ever being spelled out. So the entire motivation of Vanko is left undefined. The contrast between Stark in his absurdly futuristic lab and the brutal but brilliant Vanko in his dingy, dark apartment with equipment piled high seemed like it was taking its cues from Rocky III. In the third Rocky movie Rocky was living the high life as champion of the world while the much hungrier Clubber Lang trained with everything he had in a filthy, rat infested gym. Lang handed Rocky a crushing defeat because he fought and trained with more heart and Rocky only regained his belt by humbling himself and returning to his roots. By contrast Tony Stark defeats Vanko twice fairly handily and the Champaign never stops flowing. So who is the hero and who is the villain? Vanko's only motivation was nebulous revenge on Stark and his defeat was crushing and humiliating against the endless resources of the pompous Stark. In the final fight Iron Man and War Machine are surrounded by dozens of Vanko's drones only have Stark whip out a laser slicing them all in half without hardly breaking a sweat. I know Iron Man is supposed to be the hero with flaws but good lord is it hard to root for him.<br /><br />Early in the movie Tony Stark is called before a Senate committee led by Senator Stern (Garry Shandling). The Senator is concerned that a private citizen has such a powerful weapon and demands it be turned over to the government. His other concern is that other countries are trying to duplicate the technology. Stark gives the Senate the finger and given the ratings of the current U.S. Senate I can imagine people enjoying this scene but the truth is that Stern is right. Whether he designed the weapon or not is irrelevant this is incredibly dangerous technology and when you get right down to it Stark has been shown to be very irresponsible such as in the scene later where a drunken Iron Man starts shooting wine bottle and watermelons thrown by models. After defeating Vanko, Stern has no choice but to award Stark a medal and the rich guy with the Iron Man suit wins again.<br /><br />Since Vanko is clearly an overmatched opponent the writers gave Stark another issue to deal with. The arc reactor in his chest is poisoning his blood but you'd never know it since he seems fit as a fiddle even as the toxicity level exceeds 50%. So what he needs is a new element to replace the palladium core and leave the reactor safe. Guess what, his father discovered the element... and hid it... because... wait, hold on a second. How did his father know he was going to need an element since the shrapnel in his chest occurred long after his dad died and if his dad discovered this wonder element why did he hide it in this absurdly complicated hiding place? It makes absolutely no sense other then to look COOL onscreen as Stark uses his super technology to decode the secret. Having a NEW more powerful core Stark is in an even better place then at the start of the movie and everything is coming up roses. So we have a detestable character who wins in every possible way and learns nothing.<br /><br />The movie looks fantastic and with Robert Downey, Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell not to mention Samual L. Jackson and Garry Shandling the acting is great. High marks to Rourke in particular and it's a shame the poor Vanko was so dominated. I didn't mention Don Cheadel because he seemed to be sleepwalking through this role and Gwyneth Paltrow was a bit too shrill for my taste. The only real problem with the film is the plot but it's a killer. I used to think Superman Returns was the slowest big budget superhero movie but that one is action packed next to Iron Man 2. The racetrack scene with Vanko half an hour in is the best scene in the movie and from then on it just plods along. This one is DEFINETLY a rental. Some action movies I just skip to the action scenes to watch an abbreviated version of the movie but if you do that with Iron Man 2 you're lucky to be left with 10 minutes of movie. I can't imagine wanting to watch this one again.tion Don Cheadel because he seemed to be sleepwalking through this role and Gwyneth Paltrow was a bit too shrill for my taste.

0547258305|2.0|This book had exceptional promise. The concept of being \\"graced\\" was so awesome and some of the battle scenes were (I'm not going to lie,) pretty sweet. Where this book went wrong is when Katsa decides to rant on and on about how she is INDEPENDENT and cannot ever be tied to one man, because that statement would be too hard and hideous for her to grasp. Dear Lord. How pathetic. I really wanted to talk to this author and explain to her that although we all know that Katsa could kick butt with her pinkie finger, that doesn't necessarily mean that she also must be a Femi-Nazi. Don't get me wrong, I am totally for women's equality (I am a woman, so it would make sense.), yet I am not fanatical about denouncing marriage as a bondage situation. I mean, come on. Say that Katsa did marry Po. I don't think that she would lose \\"herself\\" and forever be Po's (heavy on the sarcasm). Katsa's endless droning and \\"confusion\\" over whether or not she can accept Po into her life romantically was terribly annoying to read, again and again and AGAIN! Also, like some of the other reviewers have commented on, Katsa is a physically abusive jerk when it comes to animals (such as horses) and sometimes Po. She isn't a pleasant protagonist and I couldn't sympathize with her at all. I wish that Cashore made Katsa a more believable heroine by giving her caring emotions and depth rather than making her a heartless killing machine.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have the Uppababy Vista stroller and i bought this cup holder last year. IT IS AMAZING! Last year i went for walks every single day with my newborn and it held my coffee steady each time! (of course, most places dont have the best covers for the coffee so there were a few drips.. but not this cup holders fault!)Even though the Uppababy has slanted handlebars it still holds the drinks upright and very securely! I have bumped into it many many times and i have NEVER had a cup or bottle fall out. It moves up and down the handlebars very smoothly. I have carried up to 3 coffees and a baby bottle and it has never even had a rip in the material let alone have it break like some other reviewers had! I figured for the price i couldnt go wrong to give it a shot but it would have been worth it even if it was even more $$!! Aside from cups, it holds my keys, my phone, pacifiers, bottles, snacks, misc things that need to be put down 'NOW'...    Overall i HIGHLY recommend this cupholder for the Uppababy Vista!!!

B00006L9ZT|4.0|Most reviewers tend to either reccomend the Solti, Boehm, or even Karajan Ring Cycles to new inductees into the world of Wagner. Ones who don't tend to do so on a strictly \\"I hate (whoever) so they automatically suck\\" platform. I, however, highly recommend this Cycle.    No it does not have the power (or cast) of Solti, Boehm, Keilberth, Knappertsbusch, or even Karajan, but it more than makes up for it in terms of overall production. Compared to other Ring Cycles on the market, this version actually follows Wagner's directions quite closely.    The Gods are definately Nordic/Teutonic in design, the Rhinemaidens are definately aquatic creatures, Mime and Alberich looks like actual dwarfs, Walhalla is a large stone fortress, the Rainbow bridge is actually featured, the Valyries look authentic (they don't have the stereotypic winged helmets, but their headgear here looks much better), the settings are realistic, and everything is clearly lifted from the original Bayreuth designs. The Gold's resting place exactly matches the original 1876 design    There are some minor changes, though: Grane is invisible as usual, the dragon looks, well, unusual to say the least, and during the redemption theme at the end, a slight change is made to what happens on stage (it's actually pretty much the same, just more uplifting than some other productions).    While the production may not be that innovative or given more thought than \\"Wagner's way,\\" I feel that in order to understand the Ring Cycle, people must be see it as closely as \\"originally intended\\" as possible.    Overall, I do prefer Chereau's 1976 version in terms of how innovative and original it is, as well as how beautifully Boulez carries the score, but people unfamiliar with the Ring will be bamboozled by how it takes place in the 19th Century.    Musically, however, is where this cycle falls a bit. Levine is often criticized for being too slow, even during the more upbeat sections of music. I find that he tends to start plodding here and there, but there are times when he flows nicely, and especially during the more dramatic sections, he is in tune with the emotions of the music. He may not have Furtwaengler's sensuality (who is also criticized for being too slow) but I find that he avoids being tepid and lethargic. People who prefer more upbeat tempos, however, should look at Boulez's Ring. I have note heard Barenboim's, but I hear he has the best control over the orchestra.    The cast is also terrific, and an improvement over Levine's contemporary studio recording (I have only heard parts of it, but enough to know about the changes). The changes are small, a different Waltraute, different Fafner, different Norns, and a few other smaller roles. Ludwig plays only Fricka in the studio, but Waltruate here as well to everyone's delight, and Salminen takes up Fafner in addition to Hagen, roles he quite possibly the best at. The biggest change in cast, the role of Siegfried, is what makes this recording a zillion times better. Reiner Goldberg did a horrible job in role in the studio (probably why he is not here) and Siegfried Jerusalem is absolutely fantastic here, playing Loge as well. He gave a better performance for Haitink (more energetic), but he owns the role completely.    The rest of the cast, James Morris as Wotan, Heinz Zednik as Mime, Ekkehard Wlaschiha as Alberich, Jessye Norman as Sieglinde, and Gary Lakes as Siegmund are absolutely fantastic as well, with kudos given to Behrens who (despite her voice being too light in my opinion) is an absolute delight on stage as everyone's favorite Valkyrie Bruennhilde.    I highly recommend this recording to anyone interested in Wagner, or to those who already have other recordings of the Cycle, as it truly helps you appreciate the drama of the Ring since seeing what happens is better than hearing obtrusive sound effects for a theatre of the mind (Culshaw did do a good job though, except for the gold stacking) for those who do not knowthe stage action.

B0001611DI|5.0|This review is of the single disc, Divimax Edition from Anchor Bay.  I had never seen this movie before and my wife and I are fans of zombie movies, so we threw this in with a bunch of movies we bought for the Halloween weekend. We didn't really know what to expect from it, other than we knew it is a cult classic. During the opening scenes, there were two things that were evident. One, the movie looks like it was filmed last week! Beautiful! The other, we thought maybe we had made a mistake because of the way the movie opens with a bunch of hectic scenes. Those fears soon subsided as the story starts to get going and we learn who the characters are that we are supposed to care about. Other than the odd opening, I'd have to say that this is my all-time favorite zombie movie, by far. But it's the quality of the remaster that really impressed me. The only movies I've seen that look this good for their age are the frame-by-frame remasters of the James Bond series. It was really hard to believe that this was a movie from 1978. It's about as close as you can get to going back in time. If you like zombie movies and haven't seen this one, you need to see it. NOW! :) This version's quality far outweighs its price.
B003UBTX72|5.0|So many rock and roll books read like history books and get bogged down in too many details.  This is not one of those books.  Keith provides a very well rounded discussion that explores his early childhood, musical influences, how he and Mick wrote so many great songs, his family life, great friends, and of course the stories of sex, drugs, and debauchery.  For those that have read and know about Keith, his memoirs will enforce his reputation as an intelligent, compassionate, \\"man of the people\\".  For those that do not know about Keith, it should be an interesting insight into a man who is probably misunderstood by the general public.  This is very well written and should be entertaining to anyone who has a slight interest in the Rolling Stones.

Its plot was unpredictable, thrilling, and fantastic. I liked how it had more action and twists than the first, that it kept me turning the page and wanting to find out more. However, it did take me awhile to finish as the middle dragged a bit. I would starting reading and after 20-30 pages or so, I'd start skimming ahead. But then the action did picked up eventually and I was hooked in the story again at the latter part of the book. I also liked how this book introduced new interesting characters and revealed some shocking secrets--it kept things exciting and me reading.<br /><br />All I can say is that Beautiful Darkness is a great sequel and definitely worth reading, especially if you enjoyed Beautiful Creatures, the first book in the series. Well, even if you're on the fence about Beautiful Creatures, you should check this book out anyway because I thought it was better. I can't wait for the next one in the series.
0553805371|4.0|It is important that great thinkers write for a general audience. Einstein did it, and Hawking continues the tradition. Brian Greene is another who does; and so is Leonard Mlodinow, Hawking's co-author of The Grand Design. Others try, but their efforts soar above most of our pedestrian heads, for instance Roger Penrose's The Road to Reality. So I am most grateful for the efforts of writer-scientists like Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow who succeed where others do not.    The book is not perfect. Every few pages one finds a lame cartoon. These cartoons are...well: lame. They are not amusing, and are not connected to the text. The illustrations are an improvement, but even here I pause and wonder. On page 54 there is an illustration of a glass of water with a straw in it. The illustration is very nice. I particularly like the red & white tablecloth upon which the glass rests. The note beneath the photo is this: \\"Refraction: Newton's model of light could explain why light bent when it passed from one medium to another, but it could not explain another phenomenon we now call Newton's Rings.\\" Now, we almost all of us have seen a straw in a glass of water. Did we need to see another? Even with a particularly nice red and white table cloth? On the other hand, how many of us have seen \\"Newton's Rings?\\" Wouldn't it have been better to have shown the readers a photo of Newton's Rings? Especially when considering that on p.117 there are three additional photographs of straws in glasses of liquid, possibly cranberry juice, which illustrate \\"refraction\\" equally well?    Well, perhaps I'm being too fussy. A bigger question is: does the book adequately answer the questions it sets out to answer? Does it explain \\"why there is something rather than nothing?\\" \\"Why do we exist?\\" \\"Why this particular set of laws and not some other?\\" I have read the book twice, and I am unsure. I have certainly had my thinking on these subjects stimulated. My brain is buzzing with possiblities. ButI feel I need to know more.... which, after all, is not a bad thing.
0743298039|4.0|As I expected, when I recieved the book it looked like it had been read a few times. There a a few rumples here and there. But what else would you expect from a paperback book that you would hope is loved? As long as you can read it, it's still usuable. I got exactly what I ordered.
B002ZG99CC|2.0|I really did not like this remake. I am a martial arts student and generally a fan of martial arts movies, so I was looking forward to this one, and particularly seeing Jackie Chan in it. And he was the highlight for me. Jaden Smith was also a compelling on screen presence, but seemed too young for the role.<br /><br />What I really disliked about the film, however, is the violent beatings the Jaden Smith character undergoes at the hands of his nemesis. I felt they went too far, were definitely beyond a PG rating, and weren't needed to establish the character's motive for learning kung fu. I kept wondering 'where are the adults?' I also felt that the 'bad' kung fu school was a bit overdone, and kind of offensive. I realize this is all part the original movie to some extent, but felt it could have been updated for a modern parental sensibility.<br /><br />So this movie really hit me wrong overall. I feel I couldn't show it to my kids, especially in this age where there is so much concern about bullying. This really sent the wrong message in that regard.
B003XU75QG|5.0|Awesome rock and roll album. Fresh sound and great vocals by Taylor Momsen. Not available in the US yet had to get it from England. Highly recommend it!
B002ZG974M|5.0|I loved this documentary, and I disagree with prior reviewers who said they felt it needed commentary. I think the lack of commentary is what made it special. As a viewer, I was entirely immersed in the pre-lingual worlds of these four babies. I think this also lifted the movie above simply being 'cute', because you can really see the developmental shifts over the course of the year, and how common they are, in spite of these babies' four very different cultural environments. At times I felt like I could practically see the little cogs spinning in their brains, trying to figure something out. Watching them watching the adults in their lives was equally enlightening.<br /><br />I do think it's important not to view this movie as a social commentary on the four cultures that are included, or on any particular parenting techniques. Only one family from each culture is represented, so they can't claim to represent the upbringing of every child in those countries. Also, these are just four cultures out of the thousands in the world, so this movie can't be said to somehow represent all of the human race either. As I mentioned, what is fascinating and inspiring is how common the human journey is our first year of life, in spite of these cultural differences.
160788657X|5.0|Will you Kindle cry babies kindly stop reviewing the price you have to pay and review the book. My 5 star review is to offset one of the cry babies, not to review the book.  Someone else please post another.  BTW, the Kindle edition costs a whopping $.48 more than the print.  Sorry Kindle users, your days of loss leader prices are over.
B0044XV3QY|3.0|I agree with many of the other negative reviewers.  Although Avatar is a great movie and a technological achievement, with the original blu-ray released in April and this one not being in 3D, it's a disappointment.  Why should we have get punished for buying the movie by having to re-buy it now? This is how it should have been released originally.  They should take a cue from Disney and release it right the first time.
0385737424|5.0|My son chose this book for a school book report. He thought that the idea of reading about a sixth grader in NY was great as he is in that grade and LOVES NYC. He liked it so much he read it in an hour. I was skeptical of his reading enthusiasm and read it myself; loved it. Not only has the fictional excitement but a great lesson on tolerance, friendship and the consequences of your acts. Lessons that my own son was struggling to learn at that time. Highly recommended.
B003R0LBVW|3.0|I read Corrections recently. I thought it wasn't too bad, so I decided to read Freedom. The first 40% of the book (I read it on Kindle) were really great, I loved it. I felt for Patty and found her story fascinating. Then the story started to disintegrate. I couldn't feel compassion to anybody in the book. They all became such appalling characters; I couldn't care less about them.  Patty, Walter, their parents, their siblings, their kids, Katz, the neighbors, everybody are such horrible and miserable people that it's unimaginable. What I was bothered especially were some really weird things that were happening to the characters in the story. Here's one example. Joe, who is about 20 years, old swallows his engagement ring by accident. What follows, is a very long and a very detailed description of the ring extraction. It's not just unpleasant, it's disgusting. Also, some of the sex scenes are pretty appalling, too. I'm a pretty open-minded person but it almost made me sick. The phone sex between Joe and Connie should have been excluded from the book, it's not literature.
0374290024|4.0|people either tend to overrate west civilization over easter civilization or the other way around. to me, each has its own achievement that is not surpassed by the other. i travelled to italy last summer, after seeing all the master piece renaissance paintings, I wondered into a small display room with art crafts from Turkey and China, i could not helped to be astonished by the fine craftsmanship exhibited from a turkish flask or a chinese embroidery even after seeing boticelli's painting. yet when back to streets of florence, i could not help to admire the sculpture, architecture left from renaissance era
B002YOKVU4|1.0|The movie (\\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\") is about two drug addicts, one of them is played by Johnny Depp. If I'd see him  in such a movie first time I would not buy any movie with him ever! Look at the picture of DVD title. This is what you going to watch through whole film: bunch of hallucinations through eyes of two losers. I couldn't watch more than half movie because it's sick delirium of ravings of a madman. They under drugs influence all the time, sweating and mumbling, doing some stupid mind disorientated things. And there is so much of that stuff in this movie that you can feel like you gonna through up already. What is this? Is this anti-drug propaganda or drugs Ad?   There are good actors in this movie like Johnny Depp, Cameron Dias (\\"Mask\\"), Tobey Maguire (\\"Spider man\\"), Craig Bierko (\\"13th floor\\") but it doesn't matter. They are in a gross movie.  Do not buy it unless you want to through away your money.  PS Reading all comments to my review, I see that there are people who probably likes that stuff. If you do - Buy this movie it's most likely part of your world.
B000CNE092|4.0|As a child I absolutely LOVED Anastasia, it was one of my favorite movies, and at 17 I still love it, especially Bartok, he's just so adorable! I'd give this five stars for the incredible value, and the great special features included in the Family Fun edition, but Bartok the Magnificent just wasn't the best, it wasn't completely horrible, but just not \\"Magnificent\\".

B0043GAZYS|5.0|Where to start? Scott Pilgirm Vs. the World is one of those movies that didn't get the attention it deserved. I read the graphic novels shortly before the film was released, and I absolutely fell in love with them. I was really excited over this movie because the trailers literally brought the books to life. When I finally saw this movie at a midnight show, I walked out of that theatre with a smile that stayed with me for many days. I had finally seen a movie that did it's source material justice. For those that have read the books, yes they are better in many ways, but the movie is a creation all its own. It took the best parts of the books, and then the movie adapted them to better fit a movie. It did not slave to remain faithful to every last detail of the books, but it shrewdly chose the best parts for fans of the books to appreciate while still keeping those who hadn't read them entertained. I can only hope that this movie finds its audience in its homevideo release. Few films are as fun or as fresh as this. 10, 20 years from now, this movie will be heralded as film that defines my generation. At least I know I will.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|James T. Kirk once told his crew, \\"RISK is our BUSINESS!\\"  Trekkers often tell each other, \\"Getting MUGGED is our BUSINESS!\\"  That's the way it feels most times, because we, like the Star Wars fans are the most loyal and die-hard on the planet. They'll put out a series. We buy it. They find fifteen seconds of backstage footage, and throw it in, then put it out, we buy it. They compile series into Fan Packs (which I thought were great samplers for people new to Trek), we buy it.   Then TOS HD.  Now, TOS Blu-Ray.  For a series that was cancelled due to ratings, this franchise has made Paramount billions.   As a lifelong Trekker who owns every DVD of every series and the Fan Collections so I don't have to root through the seasons, all I can tell you is . . .   Buy this one.  I bought The Doomsday Machine on iTunes, saw how beautifully it was done, and spent the money with no hesitation on the series set.  The space effects were incredible and, in my opinion, in no way took away from the feel of the original series.   Example, in Operation: Annihilate! The Enterprise deploys satellites around a planet to emit Ultra Violet light. in the original, we see the Enterprise go around the planet and then they talk about them.  In the remastered, we see the Enterprise orbit, the ships bay doors open, the satellites come out and open their massive emitters.   A small thing, but so sharp to see.  The Enterprise was no longer a really big model that could only go frontward in a straight line. She was alive now, with moving parts, and could list when going into evasive maneuvers.  Her \\"prop\\" days were over and she had functionality.      There are a lot of special features. One of the most memorable for me was on Season one where you were in a shuttlecraft and could navigate around the CGI'd Enterprise and get an audio tour of the ship, her parts, and what their function was from the warp nacelles to the ion pod. Another great one was an interview with Black, one of the original writers of the series talking about Ellison, Block, and how they were politely turned down by Ray Bradbury.     I have seen a review complaining that there is no MENU and you had to fast forward through episodes to get to the one you want. May be an old version. There is a menu with EPISODES, ADDITIONAL DATA (Special Features and the ORIGINAL previews for the episodes on that disk) and STARFLEET COMMAND, I believe. That, I haven't used, but I believe it puts interview on small screen while you look at the show like a commentary. To choose your episode, you click on EPISODE and on the right will appear the name of the first episode. Under that is a right arrow, go down to that to forward past that episode and go on to another. And under them all you have the option of watching the NEW version or the OLD untouched version of that episode. There is also a feature where you can compare both special effects-wise as they play.     MY ADVICE:  I have a Sony LCD, and it looked fantastic. It looked even more eye-popping when I changed the PICTURE MODE to WIDE ZOOM (if you have an HDTV you will get the black bars on either side because of the film used) and playing with display setting, I found that VIVID (or DYNAMIC on Samsung and other TVs) made the colors of the series just as brilliant as the new effects and made them mesh even more.     Also, I checked out this Three Pack, and like I did with Voyager, STNG, DS9 and Enterprise, it's cheaper if you order the three separately.   A few bucks, but with times such as they are . . .   No, my fellow Trekkers, just wait. Some kid at Paramount will come up with the idea of putting the remastered \\"Space Seed\\" in front of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan as one big epic, and they'll put that out too.  I think that one will be a pass.   But this . . .  A must-have.
B00004SEWN|5.0|\\"Long Way From Love\\" is the debut solo album by hard rock/AOR singer Mark Free originally released in 1993 and his last release before his controversial sex change. Having fronted a number of hard rock/glam metal bands such as \\"King Kobra\\", \\"Signal\\" and \\"Unruly Child\\", Mark takes a considerable musical turn with his debut album as \\"Long way from love\\" is a strictly AOR album; and while lacking the instrumental attack of his previous works, this debut is filled with powerful performances and strong songwriting while possibly standing as Free's best ever vocal performance.<br /><br />The album is big on AOR rhythms, keyboard parts and impressive lead guitar while the emphasis is clearly on the choruses where Mark's performance is monumental. The list of top AOR moments one is offered here is impressive: \\"Stranger among us\\", \\"The last time\\", \\"Hard heart to break\\", \\"State of love\\" and \\"look love in the eyes\\" all incredible material with lyrics and melodies so genuine that `itch' the listener to come back and play the album time and time again.<br />One also has to mention that there is no stable line up on this album, in fact the instruments are performed by a large cast of musicians while also having been produced individually.<br /><br />\\"Long way from love\\" is indeed a highlight in Mark Free's career, although considerably softer, or one could say more mature than his previous works. In addition, a valiant move from the singer's part to release such an album at a time when the popularity of the melodic rock genres were brutally declining. A must for any fan of fiery AOR especially for fans of \\"King Kobra\\", \\"Signal\\" and \\"Unruly Child\\".
0143116177|4.0|Much like George Santayana and to paraphrase, \\"Those who cannot remember the (financial) past are condemned to repeat it.\\"  Indeed, a cursory US centric review of the financial histories of the early 20th century or of the late `20s would have protected the average investor and financial institution from much despair.  However, we seem to let our ambitious fever overtake us every other decade or so.  One just has to remember the late '70s with the elevated commodities fever.<br /><br />All in, a very enjoyable read. Some selected books that I am fond of on the financial history side of things are included below:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0471467146 Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises]] by Charles P.

B0041HU440|5.0|\\"Worlds collide\\" is the brand new, overall 4th  studio album by American AOR/melodic rock band \\"Unruly Child\\". \\"Worlds Collide marks the reunion of the original line up of guitarist Bruce Gowdy, keyboardist Guy Allison, bass player Larry Antonio, drummer Jay Schellen and lead singer Marcie/Mark Free.<br /><br />Taking a retrospective look on Mark Free's career, it becomes obvious that the singer never stayed with any group he fronted long enough to progressively reach major recognition and chart-topping success. On the other hand having released a considerable number of influential albums, whether that would be \\"King Kobra\\", \\"Signal\\", \\"Unruly Child\\" or solo, Free comes out a very experienced musician in the genres of glam metal, hard rock and AOR; And it is fair to say that on \\"World Collide\\" the vocalist revisits most of his/her approaches and the accumulated knowledge and ability of those years has not diminished one bit during his/her absence from the field.<br /><br />\\"Unruly Child\\" re emerges a very confident band, with an album that switches effortlessly between AOR and hard rock incorporating style, melody and groove while surprisingly being big on sarcastic lyrics (namely \\"Show me the money\\") and irony (\\"Tell another lie\\"). In addition there is a fair amount of retrospectism with \\"When we were young\\", \\"Tell another lie\\" and \\"When worlds collide\\". Hence one could claim that \\"Worlds Collide\\" is a rather diverse album and, to its credit, no one song sounds alike another. Finally, despite Free being the focal point of the band, all members are given room to shine, from the keyboard melodies and openings to the rather unconventional drum fills, to the groovy guitar riffs and melodic solos, all members effectively showcase their class on this brand new album.<br /><br />\\"Unruly Child\\" have managed to come up with an album full of substance that is definitely not you average AOR while effectively demonstrating all the characteristics of the genre. The more one listens to the album the more one realizes how much he missed this incarnation of the band.<br /><br />\\"Classic Rock\\" UK magazine (issue 151) marks this album with 9/10 commenting: \\"This is the melodic album of 2010, and no mistake- You couldn't make this up\\"more one realizes how much he missed this incarnation of the band.       \\"Classic Rock\\" UK magazine (issue 151) marks this album with 9/10 commenting: \\"This is the melodic album of 2010, and no mistake- You couldn't make this up\\"
B003EYVXT6|4.0|Despite how the trailer may appear, SPLICE is not a fast-paced horror thriller. Sure, there are one or two jump moments, but overall its more of a slow-paced, character focused, classically inspired horror film. Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody both do a good job, staring as a scientific research couple whom secretly create a hybrid species in order to both further the advancement of the medical sciences and boost their egos. But as the hybrid grows, learns, and evolves, things become complicated for the couple. The majority of the film really focuses on these 3 characters and the relationships that develop between them. Splice is an interesting mix of Frankenstein/ Species/ and the Oedipus complex. This is defiantly the films strongpoint and the story makes for a good after-the-movie conversation. However Splice does suffer from some bad writing, primarily in questionable character decisions, but its not enough to completely ruin the viewing experience. The effects are quite good and the filmmakers did an excellent job of combining multiple visual techniques to bring the character of Dren to life. There is a little gore and some nudity, but not an overwhelming amount. Overall, Splice is refreshing and unlike what you typically find in Hollywood horror films these days. Although flawed, its still well worth checking out if your are a fan of classic horror/ sci-fi or you are just looking for a film that is a little different. 3 1/2 stars

B000LXH0AE|5.0|Stranger than Fiction is a unique comedy-drama starring Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah. The film is about a man named Harold Crick(Ferrell), an IRS agent, who suddenly becoming a central character in a real-life novel, and he must find the author(Thompson)before she kills him off. The special features includes several behind-the-scenes featurettes including hilarious on-set goofs with Ferrell and company and a featurette with director Marc Forster and the producers on why the city of Chicago was chosen as the backdrop for the film. The movie marks Will Ferrell's first foray into more dramatic roles, a welcome change from the wacky and silly roles that he is famous for.(i.e., Old School, Talladega Nights, and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy) Stranger than Fiction has won great praises from film critics all over the U.S., and once you see this film, you will agree.
B000JIJPZY|3.0|I  bought this play mat on a whim but now wish i had done some research first.  I find the mat itself is way to narrow and thin.  I always worry  about my son rolling onto the plastic base on either side and hurting his head or face so i end up using a folded blanket over top which sort of defeats the purpose of a \\"mat\\".  He seems to really enjoy the toys though and i like the fact that everything is interchangeable which helps keep him entertained.  He also fell in lOVE with the giraffe and plays with it off of the mat which is one of the main reasons i haven't sold it.  If i could re-do my purchase I would go with the  Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies & Lights Deluxe Gym, it seems like the much better version of this one.
0307704513|4.0|I expect that some of the ideas about strategy will work very well in a Software Development; but maybe not as well in a Product Development environment where tooling costs and material lead times can generate opportunities for more costly waste when things are done more spontaneously.  There also seemed to be some question about consistency of methods/strategies discussed between two chapters of the book.  One chapter talks about pondering something to confirm that it makes sense before doing anything about it while another chapter states that one should jump on ideas as they come up and change directions as things happen.    Again, some of this probably applies well in an Agile software development environment such as the authors reside in... but might be more costly in a physical product (non-software) development environment.    Still, in all, the book did provide alternative thoughts that are worth considering as \\"paradigm shifters\\" to break an organization out of their ruts and to think in new ways.
B000683VI4|4.0|Touching and sweet, even as a guy I thought this movie was good.  The movie is well-written and Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams make a very believable onscreen couple.  A great love story that is sure to turn anyone misty eyed.  See it, you won't be disappointed.
B000KJT8IG|4.0|I've loved this movie since i first saw it when i was around 14 or so in 1989, since then every single Christmas its on about 300 times on different channels. Chevy Chase was at his peak then slowly disappeared, while Eddy (Randy Quaid) stole the show and went on to do much bigger things. I wish they would not even have done Vegas Vacation being that it was the least funny and just down right stupid at times. This is the ultimate Christmas movie for every family to enjoy, but does it need to be on Blu Ray? No. I went to a friends house who had some movies, most of which i had already seen on blu ray, so i thought to myself well i'm in a laughing mood so why not watch this on Blu Ray. Even his nice 55 inch LED Samsung the picture just looked, well, normal, and fuzzy as well. I never really did understand why they would put movies like this in HD anyways, TV is fine, but a disc no. Most people don't care to see movies like The Notebook, Hangover, Grown Ups, 50 First Dates and those sorts of movies because its just unnecessary. I've never watched a normal film and thought wow, look at the sweat on there faces, look how vibrant their clothes look, how real that conversation looks!! Blu Ray should be put aside for action, horror, nature films or sci fi, most everything else is pretty pointless. Oh well, the movie is great and the funniest of all the franchise, my next would be European Vacation, then the original. Don't waste money though when you can just turn it on this Christmas and catch it 20 times a day before hand. I was just in the mood to watch it, but was not impressed with the quality at all. Incredible movie!! Poor Transfer.    By the way....Graacceee shee passst awwayy yearrsss ago. \\"They want you to say grace, THEEE BLESSSSINGGGG!!!\\"..Classic:)

B0042O85ES|2.0|This review is only on the Deluxe Edition, Iam not taking anything away from Ladies And Gentleman The Rolling Stones which I would give 5 Stars. My issue is with the Third Disc, which is the only reason I bought this Deluxe Edition. I feel that Eagle Rock could I have put a lot more effort into the 3rd disc which any Stones fan would feel ripped off.Eagle Rock should have  watched  the Bootleg copy from 4 Reel Produtions of ladies and Gentleman first to see what Stones fans may have wanted.Eagle Rock put (NO EFFORT INTO THE 3rd DISC). I was really looking forward to seeing the (whole) Dick Cavett show, Eagle Rock cut the backstage footage and on top of that they didnot include the footage of the opening song which was Brown Sugar and the closing song Street Fighting Man. They only showed the interviews with Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman, the live performances were cut out!!! I know there is plenty of outakes of live performances from the 1972 tour which should have been included with this deluxe edition.  Again am not taking anything away from Ladies and Gentleman, I dont want to see anyone waste there money on this Deluxe Edition!!!! (Just Buy The Single Disc)

B004132HZS|5.0|Excellent program from BBC/PBS, honestly I have never read the books or seen the older versions of Sherlock Holmes. I did grow up reading the Junior Sherlock Holmes (not written by Doyle) which I enjoyed, and I also really liked the Robert Downey Junior movie. So if you liked the movie, you'll probably enjoy this DVD set.
1615230823|4.0|Excellent.  A little statistically difficult to get into at first, but once you realizing where he's going with it, you are hooked.  I think this was such a best seller not only because of his analysis of the success of highly recognizable icons like Bill Gates and The Beatles, but because of how he handles and presents the resulting statistical information. When you read his results, you must make your own personal review and analysis of your life and your experiences.  That is really something.  Quite engaging.  And the final personal note that the author ends with is not only a total surprise, but it leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and fulfillment.  Excellent book.
0525951652|5.0|This is a terrific, hard to put down book. I can't wait for the next 2 in the series. Follett has done a great job of making a complicated historical era understandable. He brings the era to life via the families from a variety of countries. His characters are indeed true to form. The novel is riveting and informative at the same time. The situations described are realistic and interesting. For a short course on World War I history, read this novel. I'm a history major and still learned many things. From what I can tell, Follett's novel is historically accurate.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I don't know how one could view this and stay dry-eyed.  I can't, and I've watched it several times already.  There's no point in going over the plot again--it's been done, and you can only do that so many times!  I just want this film to get the five-star rating that it deserves.
0307266303|3.0|Christopher McDougall's book, Born to Run, is a pleasant read.  But it suffers from a breezy style, a tone   perhaps attractive to readers of Outside or Runner's World but not necessarily appropriate for a book that  aims to have us seriously reconsider how we move.  He's clearly a nice guy and I fault his editors for encouraging  a product.  This renders his accounts of some events so facile as to make one doubt their veracity. Hyperbole does serve him well-- \\"The greatest race the world has ever seen\\".  Maybe, maybe not.     A valuable chapter that recapitulates research on the effects of running shoes and stride comes near the end of the book.  All that material should be footnoted and could have been expanded. I bet he could have written a good yarn and been convincing as well.
B003A9OVS0|5.0|but then before i pressed enter to submit my review, i listened to it one more time, and well it finally clicked with me. i think what i was feeling before and what u may feel when u first listen to this cd, is that its nothing like the old gorillaz at all. that fact took over my liking of this album so much, that i felt let down and dissapointed. it took many listens to finally appreciate the songs, because although they dont sound like the old songs, they are not bad at all, in fact they are quite catchy. i actually ended up liking the route they took on this album, which is more hip hop than electronic which was the main theme on their previous cd, \\"demon days\\". so keep an open mind, and realize that even though its a totally different change in sound, it doesnt mean its not good.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This film does not have to entertainment value as the original 1930s Wizard Of Oz, but it's fund to watch.  I would have liked to see another cyclone again, but I guess they wanted to make it different with a raging river. There were some well done harbingers in the beginning, foreshadowing the adventure to come.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I was VERY pleased with this item, and the seller. I received the item EXACTLY as promised in the description. I will definitely deal with this seller in the future.
B003VS0CX8|1.0|This is very confusing. Is this a Blu-Ray offering, DVD, or both?  It seems to be both because there's a slash / between the two formats, but much of the verbiage is about Blu-Ray. I don't give a fig about BR. It will be a distant memory in a few years. Can I play this on my generic DVD player?
B00406UK7S|3.0|Movie pretty much goes like this. A soldier gets captured when his base gets attacked. He breaks free and runs into a group of other soldiers where he is rescued by a model that can't speak who is leading them. They take him back to the base and he joins their army for the time being. The model leads the troops into an unfortunate situation and they loose 99% of their army. The survivors flee for their lives and the real movie starts as a plot turn erupts and they are now being hunted by the model. Along their journey the soldier runs into another model in the middle of the woods that saves them, then some other stuff happens and the soldier finally gets his show down with the model that can't speak.<br /><br />Overall the story is well... not the best... the movie is entertaining... you can watch it or miss it. There's nothing really ground breaking here.<br /><br />P.S. I enjoy the \\"not helpful\\" votes this review is getting. This is actually scene for scene the plot of this movie. Which makes this more interesting.
B003XRZZFM|2.0|The heart of the band clearly left with Vortex and Mustis, or at least the musical and lyrical talent.  What is this crap?  Gateways is basically the only song worth listening to more than once.  I agree with the previous review in that this album was so over-hyped that is fell flat on its face.  I'm not really into the whole \\"they sold out!\\" stuff, but you can certainly see what touring with horrible non-black metal bands has done to this once proud group.  A total waste.
B00006I53S|4.0|I think someone earlier reviewed this lens as \\"a jack of all trades, but a master of none\\". It's probably the most accurate way to sum it all up.    I've used the lens for about 6 months with a T2i. I always feel like I need wider zoom when I'm shooting at 28, and the 135 never gets me \\"close enough\\". I can shoot indoors at decent quality, but I know I've see better and sharper pictures with other lenses on the same camera. The low ISO/high shutter pictures come out looking sharp, but could be sharper. The DOF is ok, but nothing that makes you say \\"ooooh\\".
0671449028|3.0|i am not a big fan of Sandra Boynton's books. this is the only one we bought. my 2 year old daughter loves books, but she is not too interested in this one. she has asked me what some of the animals are, and i can't name them all as they are not well-drawn. she prefers Goodnight Moon and Big Red Barn as her bedtime books.
0307390349|4.0|I was captivated by all of the stories in this collection. My one complaint is with the title story, which is actually a novella based on the life of Russian matthematician and novelist Sophia Kovalevsky. Because Munro chose to do this as a frame narration in which Kovalevsky recalls her life while riding on various trains and ferries to Sweden, the story is not told in chronological order. This creates confusion in particular when suddenly Kovalevsky's former husband, Vladimir, appears in the story without warning and his presence is only explained somewhat later. This confusion caused me to temporarily put aside the story, and it might well cause some readers to give up on the story altogether. \\"Too Much Happiness\\" is a fascinating story about how a remarkably intelligent and talented woman at the beginning of the 20th century had to deal with so much patriarchal oppression and misunderstanding, and consequently never received the venue to develop her talents she deserved. Even so, the title story is different from the rest of this collection because it is not as tight and carefully structured as the others, which are otherwise all brilliantly realized, classic Munro stories.
B003XKPPOU|4.0|The best Blu-ray of the Trilogy and a very good movie. The first is still the classic, but this one is great.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|If you like Van Morrison, you'll love this cd.  It's full of all of his best hits and then some.
0440246016|1.0|If you never got enough of Superman as a kid perhaps you will like Child's Jack Reacher.  Perhaps.  This is more a fantasy than a novel.  And a weak fantasy at that.  The plot is unbelievable, contrived and phony.  Nuff said.

0823095223|5.0|This book is Tim Bruckner, Ruben Procopio and Zach Oat's love note to aspiring sculptors longing to break into the world of comic/movie/TV figures. It's also an eloquent and beautifully-illustrated testimony to the level of skill and knowledge that goes into the creation of many pop culture figures on the market, whether they're collectible statues from Gentle Giant or 6\\" action figures being sold at Target.    The book starts off with the most basic of points - what do you want to sculpt? How do you envision your final piece - as a statue or posable \\"action figure\\"? It then leads you, point by point, down those two routes, helping you create a finished piece that embodies your vision. Aside from the invaluable planning, building, sculpting, detailing, molding, casting and painting advice, it also offers tips on building a portfolio for those wishing to break into the profession of commission sculpting, how to work with clients/Art Directors, photographing your work and setting up an efficient and safe work area.    I've spoken to several professionals in the comic sculpting business and every one of them said that, even though they have many years' experience in the field, they all learned something new from this fabulous book.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|Others have said everything that can be said about this stunning concert so I will confine myself to a few brief observations.    This cast is truly the dream cast.  Wilkinson IS Valjean and his perfomance is extraordinary. Bring Him Home is stellar, the Confrontation with Philip Quast's Javert is perfection and his Who Am I is the standout performance of the show. Philip Quast, Ruthie Henshall, Michael Ball, Lea Salonga...could it get any better than this?    Simply put, this is the best of the best in every sense.
B00001OH7V|2.0|I guess the title of my review says it all. The rest would just be filler. Better to get a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation that will give you the 3 good songs, or the soundtrack to Christiane F. For a great album with all good songs, no fillers, try \\"The Rise and Fall Of Ziggy Stardust...\\"
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Great action movie one of Russel Crowe's best,He is a very under rated actor.....Only issue is I need to brush up on my proper English at times was hard to understand...otherwise great movie old chap.
0307278255|2.0|I liked The Interpreter of Maladies...loved The Namesake (the movie more than the book--funny, it's usually the other way around, isn't it?) but wasn't drawn in by this one. I am from the same background (Bengali, Ivy League educated parents, etc) but that wasn't enough for me to give this book 4 or 5 stars. I liked the 1st three stories a little bit, but after that, I was bored with so much backstory and detail. Even within the 1st three stories themselves, I saw way too much of the cliche \\"telling without showing,\\" going on. I literally fell asleep during one of the stories. This is not to say that she is not talented. She is. She's just not my cup of tea. I prefer Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, especially her short story collection, \\"Arranged Marriage.\\"
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Of course this movie is pointed at a certain demographic (of which I'm in), but even if you're not there is an artistic style here that anyone could appreciate.  Visually attractive, has been labeled a movie for the \\"a.d.d\\" generation.  Could be, but you must admit that it's a movie of quick wit, in it's dialog and how it's edited.  Edgar Wright is an amazing director and it shows here, even if you don't care for the content.    Now speaking for one that grew up in the 80's and 90's playing 8-bit nintendo games, this is the movie of the year, from my point of view... This movie is an anthem to retro gamers of that time frame, probably the first videogame related movie to come out that was truly handled with care.  It's already a classic in my eyes, I'll be enjoying this flick years from now.  It's an amazing movie that hits a spot Hollywood has never been able to successfully hit before.
B00004RF9B|5.0|It's all here: flying saucers, talking robots, force fields, alien monsters, psychic powers -- lesser movies make do with only one of these elements at a time! The dialogue is surprisingly well-written and poetic, though like the plot it is jaw-droppingly sexist (it was 1956, after all). The special effects have held up surprisingly well for a movie that is more than half a century old at this point.    There's no excuse for not seeing this movie. It's a classic.
0316069485|5.0|Michael Connelly has invented two brilliant characters: the hard-boiled, quick-thinking street cop Harry Bosch and the criminal defense attorney whose office is the backseat of a Lincoln Town Car, Mickey Haller. Cleverly, Connelly makes hem step-brothers who discover each other fairly late in life.<br /><br /> This time around, Mickey Haller is asked to prosecute a case. Connelly does some clever set-up work to make this plausible.<br /><br /> The conviction of Jason Jessup for murdering a 12 year old girl has just been reversed because of DNA results on old evidence. The prosecutor wants to retry the case, but because the appellate court found errors in the way the DA and police handled the case 24 years ago, the DA wants Haller - a prominent defense attorney to handle the prosecution so there will be no question of bias. Haller agrees, but only if he can pick his own second chair and investigator.<br /><br />The second chair I from the DA's office - one of Haller's ex-wives and he investigator is Harry Bosch.<br /><br /> The set-up complete, we are introduced to Clever Clive Royce, Jessup's fae and money hunting attorney.<br /><br /> From here on, Connelly expertly weaves the work of Haller, the attorney determined to put Jessup away regardless of the mistakes made 24 years ago; Margie, the ex-wife and a very competent attorney in her own right establishing boundaries with Haller and Bosch, off on his own, finding some surprising new leads.<br /><br /> Each of the primary characters carries their own weight. Each adds a lot to the story. Connelly brings in a couple of other characters as well and fleshes them out pretty well.<br /><br /> The result is a fine courtroom drama, an excellent police procedural and a mildly interesting family story as well.<br /><br /> Surprises abound all the way through the last page.<br /><br /> You don't need to have read any of Connelly's previous Bosch or Heller books to enjoy \\"The Reversal\\", but you may want to give them a try after reading this one.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: a page turner with interesting characters and lots of surprises.<br /><br />Jerrycharacters and lots of surprises.

0393078299|5.0|This is an excellent book, remarkably well written and eminently readable. The Prolog is well worth the read, as is Chapter One, but if you're familiar with the term \\"blackbody\\" you'll find you can scan Chapter One as a refresher. I wasn't familiar with it so read the entire chapter closely.<br /> By chapter three, it really begins to move and sometimes reads like a good mystery novel. Several things become apparent as you read. Foremost, I think, is the realization that to scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Planck, Born, Heisenberg, Pauli, and others, the mechanics of quantum theory was intuitively obvious although their individual approach was significantly different. That debate goes on today, though at a significantly lower level of noise than early in the 20th century. One thing that struck me was Einstein's sense of humor. Subtle and telling.
044024367X|2.0|I generally like the Reacher series but this one falls short. On the other hand it wasn't bad enough to quit on.    My problem with the book wasn't the political point of view, although I'm not sure it was necessary or advisable to saddle Reacher with a political pov.       I just couldn't get over the improbable fact SPOILER that while the villian could build a 20 ton dirty bomb couldn't buy his henchmen a few guns to blast Reacher with. Reacher keeps turning up in this guys evil lair and starts brawling with two, four, six bad guys and nobody has a gun?  This is rural Colorado we're talking about.      Other than that there was a lot of walking and driving around a fairly uninsteresting setting.    On the plus side the dialogue, as usual, was pretty crisp and the background research seemed solid as well.
B003PIUBZS|1.0|im really mad because i never got it i want my money back or something
0817439390|3.0|Because He never covers point and Shoot,except for a High End P&S. Not \\"ANY\\" camera. Granted if you have DSLR features on your point and shoot, Then you might be able to take something simular to what he does with his High End Nikon. But if you want pictures like the author has in the book. You'll need to spend Pro Money to get results close to his. The Book is Great for budding Pro Photographers. But for a person with \\"Any Camera\\", it may not be up your alley. The Book will teach you to look at the  world creatively.  I see great shots all the time now. Everywhere I look. But I cant take the same picture the author does with any camera!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Like the Red Pyramid, The lost Hero switches between it's three main character's point of views. Some readers have said that Jason is annoying, dead, or dull; when in truth you get so much out of the supposed secondary characters that a lack of Jason doesn't make you like the book any less. Jason's chapters are also few in comparison to those of Piper and Leo, and though he plays a major role like Percy had, it's obvious Jason isn't Percy or is supposed to replace him.<br />The book leaves off with a promise of continuation and if I do say so myself, with more history, Riordan is bringing on a better storyline. For all the reviews have argued about the characters, they reinstate that the powers of the gods aren't merely as superficial as originally presented. This is more than just some Titan war, two Mythologies different and alike clash to defeat the god's fiercest enemies yet.<br />Finally, an author who puts a perspective of history that children and adults can enjoy.
0439023521|5.0|I'm a sucker for teen fiction. After subjecting myself to a line of girl protaganists in the line of vapid, housewife-ready Bella; Katniss, the star of the Hunger Games was like a breath of fresh air. From the first page, this book is hard to put down. Katniss is fierce, unflinching, unemotional, everything most girls and women in fiction are not.  The writing is excellent.  Suzanne Collins is so good at world-building that the premise- a group of children sent to fight to the death while a futuristic America watches on TV- doesn't seem remotely far fetched. Through Katniss and Peeta (possibly my favorite fictional character of all time) the games illustrate the struggle between the primal urge to stay alive at all costs and a shared humanity that can't be destroyed.  The action is riveting, the romance is subtle, genuinely suspenseful, leaving you wanting to know more, anxious to see what happens.  Collins has her finger on the pulse of what it is to be a teenager- volatile, emotional, unsure, but optimistic, hopeful that everything turns out in the end.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is a great buy.  It has plenty of pockets and compartments for all of your gear.  For the price it can't be beat.  I carry my D60, 35mm F1.4, 18-55mm, 55-200, my point and shoot, and all of the associated cords and memory cards with plenty of room to spare.  Just like other bags, the compartments are velcro so they can be customized as needed to fit almost any shape or size camera or lens.  The only down side to this bag is that the shoulder straps are a bit short for a large framed individual like myself.  This is a problem that I have with most backpacks so don't let this fact sway you.  100% satisfied with this purchase.
0312600844|5.0|Freedom is more than a book- its an experience that will stay with you for years to come.  It would be a great disservice to talk about the plot, which isn't the point. This book is about human beings, and how they change and evolve and stay the same over a lifetime. Patty and Walter and, to a lesser extent, Joey and Richard become fully human  over the course of this epic story. If you prefer books with characters that are black or white, lovable or contemptible, than this story is not for you.  But, if you recognize and appreciate the fact that most people are filled with good and evil, always competing with each other, than you'll identify with, and grow to love, the characters in this book.  Everyone has his reasons- and this book beautifully, painfully, poignantly illustrates this point over and over again.  The whole human experience is in this story, ambition, dreams, romantic love, family love, lust, regret, and finally, best of all, forgiveness.
B00382X4X2|4.0|Black Sabbath has always been one of my favoriate groups since day one. Not one of their best albums but still pretty good.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|If you have to buy just one Foo Fighters CD, this is the one.  Just put it on and crank up the volume.  Great from start to finish.  You will not be disappointed.
B000002KDO|4.0|Very good album. But I like almost everything they put out that has Ozzy in it.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This CD blew me away. Was a big fan of AIC in the 90's. This picks up were they left off, minus Layne. It's like they were never away for so long. Great sound and Cantrell's guitar and vocal are cranking. If you like AIC, you love this CD.
0307346617|5.0|Max Brooks futuristic zombie thriller may be the most researched and thorough book I've read in a long time. Brooks covers the effects of the zombie war on the military soldier, foreign countries, politicians, and even suburban joe-sixpack. He talks war logistics, illustrates the shared emotional frustrations of the world, tells personal anecdotes from each interviewee, and just for fun he tosses in some cool what-would-you-do-if scenarios.     If the world truly did end by a pandemic of undead, this would be the survival bible for not only the everyday person, but for the American government and maybe even the United Nations. Hindsight being 20-20, Brooks gives us the perspective of so many people who came through the war explaining their decision making process and what they would have done differently. It's so well written that it seems like this war is no longer a fictional story, but something inevitable in the near future.    The audiobook had some great actors, but you have to have good subject matter to maintain interest. Only one time during the entire book did the story seem to drag. And that short period of time had too much information and too little emotion. Otherwise, this book is flawless. I don't even read zombie books, but who can resist a novel that details the world's largest future battle from every angle.     Brooks misses nothing. I pray there is a sequel in the works! Expertly done, let's hope the movie doesn't screw it up!
030745455X|5.0|I would love to have 25 more books by Stieg Larsson.  This was, again, a fascinating adventure with Salander.  All of the characters are so \\"full-bodied\\" that you know them well.  The twists and turns and action keeps you reading throughout the night.  And humor is mixed in as well.
0060920084|2.0|I picked up this book hoping for the hilarity, irony and insight that I've found in other Bryson works, but was deeply disappointed. There are a few funny and keenly observed passages, but they are overwhelmed by a narrative that is predominantly shallow, repetitive and -- my biggest objection -- haughty and mean-spirited. Bryson is by and large a bracing, talented writer, but this work proves that even great talent can take a wrong turn.
B00447G2T8|4.0|I'll keep it short:    Pros: This is easily their best sounding album.  Tone for days.  Like Megadeth's Endgame and Overkill's Ironbound, this album is the defining cutting edge of modern metal production. This album is easily their fastest and heaviest as well.  All but two tracks are sonic thrashers.    Cons:  A bit predictable.  Not quite as progy as their last two, but hey, I think I'll survive.  There is definitely some moments of super cheese.  The next cons will only be applicable to avid helloween fans: There are a few riffs and lead licks that they have definitely used before, but for their umpteenth album, its to be expected.  Andy's range is slowly but surely diminishing; still sounds great, but not quite as flashy as Keeper: Legacy.      P.S.  There was a sticker on the cover of my copy that said this album was a \\"return to form\\".  Obviously whoever wrote that is not a Helloween fan, because anyone who really knows Helloween knows that no two of their albums sound alike, and that their last two releases have been ridiculously good.  If anything, this is a return to unrelenting speed.  They \\"returned to form\\" when Deris came into the circle and they released Master of the Rings.
0385342039|5.0|This is the best book from Kinsella after The undomestic goddess. Love it so much! Keep it up, Kinsella!
B0038NN3B4|5.0|This is gospel for the obese! I do wish they included a technical section. I recommend reading the new book but also read Dr. Atkin's original book if you have not done so. Maybe the technicalities are not desired by some but anything this important needs a DNA blueprint for all to read if they want to.
B002ZG981E|5.0|5 stars! When you go back a watch it again and again, it brings back what movies have been missing since the Sixth Sense. If you hate movies that require you to use your brain and focus on little facts, then this movie isn't for you. But if you are like me, someone who loves movies that can be discussed in depth conversation then this is a Must BUY!
0446693804|5.0|if you like the movie you haveee to read the book ! its way better and sooo cute !! If you dont have much time and want to read a good book raed this book only took me around 3 hours to read and couldnt put it down ! The book came fast and in good condition also :)
0689865384|4.0|Uglies is a great book for people who love science fiction novels.  It is an easy read and keeps you wanting to read more.  In Uglies there are 2 different worlds; Pretty and Ugly.  They are both separated by a bridge that connects them both.  Every teen turns pretty by an operation at 16 and that boy/girl can enter the Pretty world.  The Pretty world is high-tech and the dream place to be.    In Uglies, the main character is Tally.  She dreams about her \\"operation\\" and cannot wait to turn pretty.  A few weeks before Tally's operation, she meets a new friend Shay.  Shay is very adventurous and rather live life on the edge.  Shay shows Tally a different perspective on the pretty side.  One day Shay runs away and Tally is the only one who might know where she is.  When the authorities find out, they give her two options: 1. to find Shay and turn her in, or 2. Never be able to turn pretty at all.
B003OFHMKO|5.0|Esperanza is a new and vibrant talent in the jazz world. I love the way she combines music, vocals, Her music is so other worldly. Hard to explain her music unless you hear it. She definitly Loves music. that comes across on this cd.  I am not a jazz enthusiast, I love all forms of music. I think Esperanza is a gift to the music world . I believe this young woman will provide talent and sophistication in music for years to come. I can hardly wait to see what she will do next.  I don't buy cd's very often, when I do it has to be something special. Esperanza is certainly SPECIAL!!!!!
B0030Y10QQ|5.0|The DVD I received was a REGION \\"0\\" DVD which is good in all DVD players. The DVD is a direct copy of the VHS and the sound quality is below average, more like a bootleg. But the show is timeless and worth every penny! 5 STARS!.
B000EGCITG|4.0|Titling an album \\"I'm Not Dead\\" is almost a dare to your audience. It would be far too easy for a hater to flip that title around on Pink; if you have to say something like \\"I'm not dead,\\" chances are you're already in the morgue. But not our grown-up bad girl. This album is sassy, snotty, compelling, introspective, catchy and eclectic as all get out. Pink most certainly not dead. In fact, she's moving through so many phases, it'll be hard for other popstars to keep up.<br /><br />The funny sideswipe of \\"Stupid Girls\\" opens the album with Pink not only tearing down the vacuous no-talent scenesters that populate Los Angeles Party palaces, but also seemingly a primal scream to escape the insular star universe they hang out in. The theme is revisited in the somber \\"I Got Money Now,\\" where she celebrates her success and questions if she has become any better than the loner who broke from the pack and made it to stardom. Which is followed by \\"Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self,\\" which is absolutely dazzling. As a song to the misfits wandering if it ever gets better, Pink emotionally puts forth that it will.<br /><br />That's not to say \\"I'm Not Dead\\" is all emo. \\"Cuz I Can\\" celebrates the stardom without any self consciousness at all, even laying in a ridiculous \\"Ice Cream, Ice Cream, we all want Ice Cream\\" chant in the chorus. \\"U and Ur Hand\\" is an absolute howl, the female shot fired right before some Billy Idol wannabe would have to break into a chorus of \\"Dancing With Myself.\\" There's plenty to enjoy on this collection of modern pop, and Pink may be the best of the breed currently putting these kind of records out.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|Taylor Swift never ceases to amaze me. She's young, beautiful, down-to-earth, and talented. I just had to get this album after falling in love with Fearless I did not hesitate to buy this album. Taylor is an amazing song writer and musician and her lyrics hit to the core with me. I've fallen in love with just about every song on this album. Some make me cry and some have me dancing around my room. Is it weird that a 23 year old guy like me can relate so much to this 20 year old girl's music?? She's no doubt a great role model to girls out there and I am thankful that artists like her exist.
B002ZG981E|1.0|Not much more to add really. I managed to watch this farce for about half an hour, I desperately wanted to give it a chance, but every passing minute is such an insult to my intelligence that I cannot carry on. Then I tried again to continue, because I thought it's not fair to rate a movie without watching it to the end. But then again, I'm not a masochist.<br />This film is the perfect example of how movie success depends hardly on movie quality, but almost solely on marketing. The same happened with the Matrix a few years back. Farcical setting, totally unrealistic story, but great marketing: Box office success.<br /><br />You probably already know the deal, unfortunately I was unsuspecting before I tried to watch it: Getting into other people's dreams, creating a believable world in the dream where multiple dreamers can interact with each other, and in this way, collect important information from the mark. Of course the dreams also have dreams within, and it's hard to know what is real and when your're dreaming.<br /><br />Whatever. No idea why anyone would WANT to watch this, other than because of the hype. But the hype has very little to do with the quality of the film. This film's whole focus is on the farcical notion of creating dreams for people, and especially, interacting with other characters in the dream who are dreaming the exact same dream. If the film were not so consumed by this outragous technicality, and it had some character and heart, some sort of purpose, I could probably let slip the ridiculousness of the whole theme. I have been known to enjoy the odd sci-fi. But this lacks any heart, all it does is try to look smart.<br /><br />I find it grossly unfair that this junk rates above 9 on IMDB and 4.5 stars on Amazon. However, my rating of 1 star is not because I want to bring the total down, it is rather what I think the realistic rating is.
0143034901|5.0|I read this book on a reccomendation.  It has exceeded my expectations.  It is gripping and atmospheric, and transports you into the life of the main character, Daniel. Everyone else has already said what is important here.  I just wanted to add that the book was not at all confusing, despite the plot being quite complex.  I actually thought that it manages to weave a multi-faceted and intriguing story without losing the reader!
1599218011|5.0|I am SO tired this morning and it is all because of this book.  I received this yesterday and decided to skim it and the \\"really\\" read it this weekend.  WRONG!  I could NOT PUT IT DOWN--it was that good.  This rich text covers everything to juicing to the gluten free diet to dry brushing and exercise.    Many \\"diet\\" books come from a place of deprivation and \\"woe is me, I can't have that\\" sort of thing.  NOT this book.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|Michael Jackson, to no surprise, made a magnificent performance in this concert. In the beginning, he comes from under stage with a explosion, and the fans went crazy. He slowly took his sunglasses off, and opened up with \\"Jam.\\" The performance of \\"Human Nature,\\" my favorite song from Jackson, was attractive. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" had a shocker. In \\"She's Out of My Life,\\" Michael brought a lady up on stage for a brief amount of time. It was an emotional performance. \\"Thriller\\" was okay. The stunt that went along to \\"Beat It\\" was noteworthy. \\"Heal the World\\" presented a ballerina and included foreign children upon stage. \\"Man in the Mirror\\" was the showstopper, with Jackson doing multiple spins and then falling down. Great performance.
0307346617|5.0|I usually avoid giving full ratings to films or books. Yet this book deserves a 5 star rating. It cost me a few nights sleep in which I couldn't stop reading. Other reviewers went into details... I just want to add more praise to a great book. Any person mildly interested in politics, history, international relations, sociology, etc... will love this work. I hope to see more books from him soon.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I liked a few of the songs from Graduation by Kanye West, his third album. It was broadcasted that Kanye West and 50 Cent went head to head since their albums came out at the same time, but Kanye won the battle, and according to Wikipedia, Graduation sold an amazing 957,000 copies in its first week and eventually went double platinum. Professional critics gave this album good ratings, including Allmusic, Robert Christgau, Los Angeles Times, Rolling Stone, and USA Today. The album released 5 singles and included 5 videos to go along with them: the swagger-like \\"Can't Tell Me Nothing,\\" \\"Stronger,\\" \\"Good Life,\\" the brilliant \\"Flashing Lights,\\" and the piano \\"Homecoming.\\" \\"Champion\\" has a chorus that boosts your self-esteem. \\"Big Brother,\\" the last track, has a hot beat. The album went to No. 1 on a few charts.
1439177783|3.0|I bought this after seeing Portia with Oprah then on Ellen. Here were the ups and downs (no weight pun intended) of the book to me - to help you decide if it's for you.<br /><br />- She's an interesting enigma - and an articulate, honest writer.<br /><br />Before I read this I found Portia a little fascinating.  I think a lot of good-will has been generated to her from just being associated with Ellen whom many people adore. Yet, despite her stints on TV shows - she's really not that well known or remembered outside of her attachment to Ellen nowadays.  So, it's an interesting look at a sort of enigma, told straight and with far more honesty than one would expect.<br /><br />- But, the period of her life the bulk of book is devoted towards - is a time of being a self-absorbed, emotionally unstable and rather stereotypically insecure Hollywood actress - which gets a little wearing at times. Sometimes, I found it seemed more like someone doing their journals for some self psychoanalysis, eating disorder project than actually trying to get a fuller tale across.<br /><br />The main focus is her descent into an extreme eating disorder, as she obsesses over how she'll look in any given scene and whether she'll ever be \\"perfect enough\\". While it's interesting to hear how someone that had it pretty much all in Hollywood terms (the money, looks, shows, etc.) is so self-loathing and insecure inside, it gets harder to care as she goes along what she's eating and not eating, how much she exercises and how the only thing that interests her is herself. The other aspect of her fear of being \\"found out\\" as a lesbian is more interesting, but wasn't so much a focus of that time for her.<br /><br />- This has been billed as something that younger women that suffer from eating disorders or body image issues should read - but, I'm just not that sure that's a good idea.  Still, it's probably great for those that are around those w/ one that want to glimpse into the mind of why they're doing it and why they lie about it.<br /><br />The \\"lost in anorexia\\" part gets most of the book, with her actual overcoming of the disease and dealing with her sexuality more openly getting smooshed into a couple of chapters at the end. Unfortunately, to the warped perspective of someone in the throws of an eating disorder - I fear that so much on the actual disease could very well mean that it reads like a \\"how to be a good anorexic\\" guide more than the tale of horror it truly is, particularly since she goes into such detail about how she achieves her great weight loss, and her continual refusal to give up the \\"thinnest pursuit\\" while still all the while having incredibly good material success. On the other hand though, she brings to vivid life the fears and mindset that drove her into her unhappy weight obsessed world that is more than worthwhile for those that have family or friends fighting the same battle.<br /><br />Bottom Line: 3.5 stars.  An honest look at one enigmatic Hollywood starlets terrible and unhappy battle with her inner demons and anorexia that's honest and well-written. But, it would have been more engaging, for me, if she'd brought a more robust picture and a bit more depth about herself and life - rather than focusing so absolutely on \\"the detailed hows and whys\\" of her anorexia and her inner struggle as a Lesbian. Still, for those that want to learn more about eating disorders and the mentality behind them - this is a book for you.e \\"lost in anorexia\\" part gets most of the book, with her actual overcoming of the disease and dealing with her sexuality more openly getting smooshed into a couple of chapters at the end.

0446195529|5.0|Oliver Stone has led so many lives he lost count.  For all the losses he has suffered there has been the gain in his friends and cohorts known as the Camel Club.  A group of people that are as different they come together and make one large, right group.  They solve crimes, take care of each other and never fail to have one another's back.  But this latest case is one Stone has to handle on his own and no one including him is happy about it even though the President of the United States is asking for his help.<br /><br />But before Stone can do his work for the President a bomb goes off across the street from the White House creating the scenario where conclusions are drawn, angles are worked and assumptions made.  While everyone is running to the right the masterminds are veering to the left and keeping everyone off balance including all the alphabet agencies in Washington, DC.  Stone is drafted back into the service of the government with the promise that all past indiscretions would be erased yet the problem for Stone is that his sins have been of such huge proportion he is not sure this is a statement based in fact.  But Stone finds himself partnered with an MI6 agent who is as cunning as he is and keeps up even while running after him.  The Camel Club goes from upset at being turned away to forcing its way into the investigation and from that moment on the determination to capture the criminal and figure out what is really going on grows to a proportion even Stone can't control.<br /><br />But the agency he is now working for is throwing him off with smoke and mirrors, bodies are piling up, misconceptions abound and everyone becomes a suspect.  Stone wants the nightmare to stop but for every decision he makes that draws a resolution to the case another one shows up to prove to him the last one was way off base and leads blow away with the wind.<br /><br />Without his group Stone knows he can't solve this case but in this particular situation is the gain of apprehension worth the answer to who did the deed?<br /><br />This series blows me away every time because the characters have so much depth and they are written with such clarity that you feel they just passed you on the street and said Good Morning.  Stone may lead this merry band of misfits but he is not their leader he is a member of a close knit, well thought out group of people that can easily carry any book on their own and have proven that in the past.  Mr. Baldacci knows how to write a great story and this one stands out in that it will scare you to realize the fiction he is proposing is probably fact and I hope there is a retired Agent Stone out there protecting us.r to who did the deed?

0470424656|5.0|I have to begin with a gripe. The first four reviews are implausibly quick, given the length of this book, and are all five-star. Three are from people who reviewed only one product, one is completely devioid of content. The fifth reviewer has reviewed one other product, a razor. I understand the temptation to stuff the ballot-box early by having friends review, but I think you should find real reviewers and insist on some content.<br /><br />There are several great valuation books out there. [[ASIN:0471751219 Damodaran on Valuation]] concentrates on security valuation and is the most academic. [[ASIN:047037148X Business Valuation]] is the best for small, private companies. [[ASIN:0470277343 Business Valuation on Wall Street]] tells you how Wall Street approaches the question. [[ASIN:9812563741 Theory of Valuation]] is the best on theory. [[ASIN:0073382337 Corporate Finance]] has the best treatment of valuation among corporate finance texts.<br /><br />Earlier editions of this book were the clear leaders in big and complex public company valuation. There is extensive and detailed instruction for a big team analyzing for a big project, whether it is capital budgeting, capital structure, merger, acquisition, restructuring, bankruptcy or any other valuation topic. It is comprehensive and clear. If you work on this kind of project, you need this book. If you don't work on this kind of project, it can still give you a tremendous amount of insight into the factors that contribute to shareholder value.<br /><br />The most important improvement in the fifth edition is to go beyond the developed-markets/US-style financial statement presentation to cover emerging market companies in detail. I can't say whether the section is good as I have zero experience in that area, but it sounds right and I trust the authors. The treatment of capital structure and investor relations is considerably improved based on events of the last three years. They also stuck in some useless fluff about the necessity to maximize shareholder value and behavioral finance (I don't mean those aren't interesting areas, just that there's no depth to the presentation in this book, and clearly no real interest by the authors).<br /><br />One minor gripe is the examples are usually placed around the beginning of 2008, for a book published in 2010. That's a big difference considering what happened in 2008 and 2009. I understand why you don't want to rework every example of a book this big, but some of the projections are downright comical to someone knowing what actually happened. I suppose that might help readers develop humility, at the end of the day, valuation is a matter of opinion based on highly uncertain information about totally unknowable future events.

B0043GAZYS|4.0|The Film    If you can find a better piece of ridiculous nonsense to kill off an afternoon, I'll buy you a coke.  Scott Pilgrim is a fresh and preposterous journey back to the days of youth you may not want to remember.  Edgar Wright goes all the way with this comic adaptation and pulls no punches.  It veers from the elaborate, if overlong, action sequences to good old fashioned one-liners...\\"HE PUNCHED THE HIGHLIGHTS OUT OF HER HAIR!!!\\"    Scott Pilgrim vs The World has the same pulse as Tom Tekwer's \\"Lola Rent\\" paired with visuals right out of Cowboy Bebop.   The only gripe I had was Michael Cera is getting a bit long in the tooth for these aloof post teen deadpan parts.  He's alright, but I really anted to see somebody new.  I'm not sure Mary Elizabeth Winstead is good, or like Scott we just are enamored with her polychromatic hair styles.  It's not perfect, but by the end, you're glad you saw it.    It's worth it for the Vegan Police alone.    The Blu-Ray    High-Def Digest had a good tip off that this one looks a bit flat.  I have to agree.  In the theater, this thing was like walking down the red light district in Hong Kong.  On my Bravia, it comes off a bit muddy considering all the colorful effects work.  Blacks are more grey and there's not much pop to the colors.  It looks clean but I can't imagine the regular DVD being much of a consolation.  Its good but a bit disappointing.      The Film   4/5  The Blu-Ray   4/5
0307165485|5.0|As the title states, this book is nothing less than priceless! I learned to read with this book at the age of 4 and wound up being the only child of my kindergarten class the following year, who could read. I've since lost my copy as I've moved away from my parents house, but still remember in vivid detail the wonders of this book. The fun I had reading it could never be matched, and I still remember all the pictures by heart! I can't believe I've found it again! Thank you Amazon!!! As we're speaking I'm ordering 3 copies of it. One for my little boy who is absolutely enamored with books and I'm sure will love this one just as much as I did, and the other 2 for my brothers who also loved it when they were little and now also have little ones of their own. This book has been a treasure for my family for as long as I can remember and I plan on keeping it that way for many, many years to come!
0439023513|5.0|I realize there has been a lot of controversy about the last book in this series.  If you like your stories to end in a neatly wrapped package with a perfect bow on top, you shouldn't read this book.  If, however, you can make a journey with a damaged, imperfect girl who is trying to keep the pieces of her life together and protect the people she loves,  you will be deeply moved by this book.  This is a story with many unexpected twists and turns and heartbreaking scenarios.  The book makes it clear that once something is broken and twisted, you can never go back to the way it was.  It would be cheap and offensive for this book to end with everyone alive, well, and blissfully happy.  I was able to love, mourn, break, heal,  transform, and ultimately rejoice with Katniss.  I respect Suzanne Collins for giving a realistic, believable conclusion to this story.  It is one of the best books I have ever read.
B002HNAAZ8|5.0|When I read the first Bruno Ravel interviews after the Revolve release, where he stated that this was the best album of their career I was skeptical. Danger Danger is one of my favourite rock bands, I love their entire discography, but doing something better than Screw it! or better than the debut album, I thought it was almost impossible. Their albums are without a doubt some of the best hair metal ever conceived and recorded in my opinion. Now, this one. It's difficult to say if this is their best album ever, and this thing I think that can testify how great this album is. It is the best possible melodical rock in the american way I can think of. The eleven Revolve tunes are stunning, really, if you love the genre and the old Danger Danger stuff, you will love it. The band is tight and the arrangements very beautiful As usual with Danger Danger, the melodies are simple, but catching with a juvenile touch that other bands can't achieve. It surely depends on Ted Poley which has on of those voice that trascend the genre, he seems to embody the spirit of a young and joyful, hopeful America. He seems to be able to summarize the entire american rock history in his voice, this is my opinion. I feel his voice this strong! I loved Paul laine too, and I believe he gave his best in the phenomenal DD live album Live & Nude. But Ted Poley is the voice of DD. Talking about band members even if I feel Andy Timmons to be the perfect DD guitarist, Rob Marcello is SO AMAZING that makes me doubt about it. I think he has been a fantastic choice for DD in replacing Timmons years ago. Now he perfectly fits the band and his contribution is stellar. The songs are, delicious american hair rock the way WE, kids of the eighties like it, great guitars, splendid riffs, touching melodies, unforgettable power ballads. I don't have a paricular tune to point out. The first eight tunes are amazing, they really make you think this to be the best DD album, ... they are on THAT level, ... Dirty Mind is a marvellous closing number. The two tunes that I rate a little below the par are \\"Beautiful Regret\\" and \\"Never give up\\", ... but they are nice tunes, ... the problem is that the other 9 are so great examples of rock with balls that, I have to rate them a little less. In the end a stellar release from a band that I'm happy is still Alive & Kicking!is a marvellous closing number.

B000QJLP40|5.0|The partnership of John Lennon with Sir Paul McCartney is one of the best partnerships that the world has ever known, when it came to the song wrting of The Beatles. Both of them wrote fantastic music and lyrics.Once John Lennon was no longer with The Beatles band, which the fab four separated by 1970, John Lennon continued showing us his composing talents, with famous songs such as \\"Imagine\\", which is included in this compilation of The Very Best Of John Lennon. Another song by John Lennon, which I find it really amazing is \\"A Working Class Hero.\\" Is sad! that John Lennon can't continued entertain all of us, but his legacy and music will always live forever! ! !. I would say, that John Lennon was and he will always be, one of the best music composers of the XX Century! !.

B000IJNGAO|5.0|MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was a dismal failure as a BBC television special, and justly so. In fact, it was so awful the program was never aired in the United States. Unscriptedly ad-lib and haphazard, the film's occasional musical performance highlights couldn't redeem what was a silly exercise in group personal excess.<br /><br />Conversely, the American record album of MMT (ironically unavailable in Britain) was a wondrous thing indeed. The entirety and order of its songlist are included on this CD release. Inside the record's foldout cover are several pages of 12\\" stills taken directly from that strange movie. The LP also contain the complete song lyrics. Best of all, several Top 40 records that weren't a part of that original TV show were used to flesh out this set.<br /><br />The majority of the songs on this Xmas '67 release received a great deal of American AM radio airplay at the time. No other US Beatles album contain as many chart topping hits as MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. Pretty good for what at the time was considered a letdown for all involved and their fans.<br /><br />In many ways, MMT holds up better than SGT. PEPPER'S.

B000GWE44U|3.0|Kubricks the Shining isn't a very scary film, yes it's suspenseful but it won't make you jump out of your seat because it was so scary.    The only scary factor in the movie is the character Jack Nicholson portrays, he looks crazy and scary.     For anyone interested in watching the film, I recommend reading Stephen Kings novel first if you really want to get scared,and yo also get to picture the characters how you want. I think that's very fun.
B0000714BP|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. Not only does it have Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes as drag queens, but it's very uplifting and touching. Far ahead of its time!
0743437497|5.0|This is one of the first Stephen King novels I have ever read, and it was very intriguing. I loved how the King created his characters.   I never wanted to put the book down, it was very suspenseful not knowing what was coming next.   There really is no comparison between Kings novel and Kubricks film   There are a lot of details that make the novel unique, it tells you a a lot about the characters.   Anyone from the ages of 16 can really enjoy this novel, you won't want to put the book down.
B000RK3JOC|5.0|After reading \\"Looking For Alaska\\", another novel by John Green, I was intrigued to read more of his works. \\"An Abundance Of Katherines\\" really surpassed my expectations. I recommend this book to everyone of all ages. It's real literature that anyone can relate to because we've all had our share of \\"Katherines\\" in the past (LOL), but seriously check this book out. It's amazing and I'm sure anyone who is interested in reality based works of literature would enjoy it :).
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is my second set of these headphones in ten years.  I am a distance runner and wanted a bud that wouldn't irritate my ears over prolonged use, wouldn't pop out with the jerk of a cord (which is why I like the over-the-head piece) and didn't totally eliminate the sound around me.  My last set died after too much rain exposure, which is to be expected and it took ten years of northwest rain - so it was easy to spend such a small amount on another set!
0385342047|3.0|I've been reading the Shopaholic series from the beginning. I was a very enthusiastic reader of the first three books, but lately I've been thinking that they're getting a bit stale. I'm afraid that holds true for the latest Shopaholic volume. It's hard to believe that Becky Brandon never learns, but she doesn't. She continues to lie her way into absurd situations, from which she barely escapes. To add to the fun, there's now a new mini-Becky, named, of all things, Minnie. Minnie shares many of her mother's tendencies for impulsive behavior and designer labels. But the traits that make Becky Brandon somewhat dim-witted and charming simply do not translate well to a two-year-old. Minnie Brandon is a brat, and Becky feeds right into it.<br /><br />I'm starting to think that this series has run its course. Becky Brandon was amusing as a 20-something girl-about-town. As a mother, she's far less charming. Kinsella's writing is still lively and amusing, but would likely be better utilized in other projects.

B003VJTGLQ|2.0|I have to say, American Beauty is one of my favourite movies, but this Blu-Ray feels very lackluster.     Pros-     Picture- quality is decent    Cons-     Sound- horrible, I had to keep turning my t.v. volume up and down because some parts are inaudible, often times the volume would drop considerably mid-conversation. This didn't happen in the regular d.v.d., and it I've never had another blu-ray that I had this problem with either.     Special features- next to non, I'm not exactly sure what makes this Sapphire Series but I'm not impressed.    The movie gets 5 stars, the blu-ray gets 2.
0811875555|5.0|This is simply one of the best \\"art of\\" books I've read.  Though smaller than the typical coffee table Disney books (i.e. Pocahontas...Tarzan) it packs a ton of sketches, drawings, paintings and inspirational art within its covers, and one can't help but be transported into this magical world when looking through it.  If you're a fan of Glen Keane (Head animator of Beast, Mermaid, Tarzan, etc.) you'll really enjoy the large amount of his drawings that are displayed.  It was also nice to see some of Glen's daughter, Claire's work within these pages.  There are many other amazing drawings and paintings as well which include work by Lisa Keene and David Goetz, as well as the wonderfully talented Andy Gaskill and Jin Kim.<br /><br />But even if you don't know any of these names and just want to know a little bit more about how this film was made, you won't be disappointed.  The art, in and of itself is simply spectacular and you'll get basically a portfolio representing many different styles and viewpoints.  I was often disappointed in the earlier Disney \\"art of\\" books because I simply wanted to see more - more drawings and more paintings.  But this book exceeded my expectations and really packs it in.<br /><br />The writing is very good as well.  I enjoyed hearing about Glen Keane's desires in making a \\"Sincere Fairy Tale\\" which was carried forward by directors Howard and Greno.  There's also a very good chapter on the design and style of the film which shows the inspiration of Pinocchio and Cinderella right next to the Tangled Designs.  Photos of Disney Land Architecture and how it inspired the film were also fun to look at.<br /><br />The book is well made and is a very good quality, similar to the previous Disney books in binding and paper stock.  The printing is terrific and the full color art seems to have been captured beautifully.  Anyway, if you're a fan of Disney, or simply curious about the making of this film, I really think you'll like this book.  Having collected these things since I was a kid, this has got to be one of my favorites.  The animation drawings, the architecture, and the paintings are all tremendous.  The space in the book  is well utilized and there isn't a lot of filler screenshots like some earlier works.  Hope you enjoy.s since I was a kid, this has got to be one of my favorites.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I'd been wanting a gaming headset for quite some time now, and I decided to go for gusto and get a really nice set.<br /><br />Pros -<br /><br />Quality - Logitech really does make nice stuff, I like the firm yet soft feel of the rubber they use for most of their products.<br />Mic - Picks up my voice nicely, no complaints from anyone I've talked to, and I like that I can just flip it up  and down to turn it on and off.<br />Range - I've gone to the kitchen, made myself some food, walked around the house all while carrying on a conversation in vent, it's very liberating. ;)<br />Software - The voice modification is very easy to use, but really all it does is change pitch and edge, I doubt this is much different that any other voice mod. Also, I really like that it tracks how much battery time is left if you open it up, or how much time untill full charge if you open it up while you're plugged in.<br />Charging system - If you keep your computer on all the time this setup is probably ideal for you, as you'll pretty much never have to plug it in while you play, but for those of us who have to charge it occasionally during play, it's got a nice little spindle that you can roll the usb cord out from to make it \\"adjustable\\", it kind of keeps the cords out of the way a little bit too, and you can plug the wireless receiver into it.<br /><br />Cons -<br />Surround Sound - Sometimes if I turn, on rare occasions the sound becomes very distant. (i.e. I'll be sitting next to a guy talking (an npc in a game), and he'll be talking to me, I'm facing him, he's loud, then I'll turn so he's talking to my right side and it will all of a sudden sound like he's in a fish bowl 100 yards away). You can actually adjust sound for different channels which is great, but it's not consistent so it'd be hard for me to tweak it.<br />Comfort - kind of. These are circumaural, which means they go around your ears, which is what I wanted. When I first put them on they don't feel that comfortable, more neutral, and I kind of have to adjust them a little bit once in a while to stay comfortable. That being said I've kept them on for extended periods of time and pretty much forget about them.<br /><br />Overall very happy with these, I don't know how I would change the comfort as the padding feels comfortable and they pivot/adjust every which way already... I've tested a couple pairs that felt better during short play sessions but since these seem to get comfortable over time I'm not worried about it.<br /><br />edit: 2+years later, boom is broken, both of my buddies booms broke as well, no abuse really...oh well, still works with some duct tape. Sound quality is never an issue, but sometimes the headphones get messed up at the moment I plug it in to charge and won't turn back on unless I restart the whole machine. Voice modification is actually pretty silly, everyone else on the channel will hate you. Wireless is awesome, still holds a good charge after all this time, sound quality is good. I would and probably will buy another pair of these, still 4 stars...probably 4.5 if they allowed half stars.<br /><br />2nd edit: gorilla glued the boom back on and it's good as new!
B0041KKYBA|1.0|Can you trust leftist Hollywood and George Soros to give you an accurate picture of what led to the collapse of the financial sector and the housing market?  Well, yes - if you happen to think big government and massive regulations are the answer to our economic problems, rather than an enabler.<br /><br />This movie is a 60 Minutes hit piece plain and simple, all the way down to the damaging editing of interviews to humiliate alleged villains.  Except I was fortunate enough to pay admission.<br /><br />They prop up Barney Frank of all people as an authority on the issue in this film, when he was one of the chief architects of the disaster - encouraging Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increase exposure to subprime mortgages - and become one of the largest originators of packaged mortgages - the main ingredient of CMOs.  I would encourage you to research this independently if you don't believe me.  Sure - the financial services firms have gotten way too big - probably the only useful point in this movie - but guess who most of their political contributions went to in the last election: Democrats.  And it's the Democrats who want big business and big government to succeed because it's easier to control an economy with fewer players.<br /><br />So the solution to big business is big government - its circular reasoning at its finest - and pretty much what got the whole mess rolling.  When the government attempts to control businesses to effect \\"economic justice\\" as attempted by the Community Reinvestment Act, the results are the subprime mortgage crisis.<br /><br />This movie delves into events all the way into 2010 - but a main player and culprit in our escalating economic problems is curiously absent: Barack Obama - though he shows up as a heroic savior at the very end of the film.  If that doesn't tell you this is a biased movie, I'll probably never reach you.
B003VB5E2E|2.0|I am a very big Clapton fan and I pre-ordered this DVD. I enjoyed watching Cross Roads 2009. The quality of the DVD is well done and the music is overall good. My main complaint(s) are that many of the same musicians were invited back from CrossRoads 2009 - so much so, that it almost seems like a repeat of the year before. Also, some of the choices made for the DVD are not comprehensible to me.  Jimmy Vaughn gets more air time on stage than Joe Bonamassa? Almost 30 minutes of the DVD devoted to Derrick Trucks band? Why is Vince Gil back again?  I almost thought  Eric was too lazy to change his invitation list from last year and just clicked the send button on his laptop to last year's invite list.  I noticed that many of the positive reviews on this site for the DVD were from people who went to the live concert and are actually reviewing their experience from the live show. Their reviews I would imagine are colored by their good memories of the concert. Bill Murray is back again as MC as well. I like Bill Murray but his act here is the same as it was in 2009. So if the thought of seeing Bill dress up like Elvis for a few cheap laughs makes you cringe a little, then save your money and rent this DVD on NetFlex.
067144901X|5.0|My daughter is 10 months old and I read all the usual classics to her before bed each night. This is one of the few books that holds her attention all the way through. It's one of the few books that I REALLY ENJOY reading. It's so simple that I find myself reciting the book to her like a poem when we're in the car or on our walks. It starts out like so many other animal sound books (and we have several)with the usual a cow says moo... so even I get a kick out of the pigs going LA LA LA and the cute pictures of the dancing pigs followed by the sedate oinking pigs.  It gives even me a giggle and I think, more than anything, my daughter can sense this enjoyment in my voice.
B0043GAZYS|2.0|My husband and I made the mistake of watching this gem last night.    I found myself asking internally how much longer this movie was going to be.  Instead of rooting for Mr. Pilgrim to defeat the next 'evil X', I was counting down how many more X's he had to fight before this dread had finally ended.    Firstly, Michael Cera is pretty much the most boring, predictable actor of our time.  Yet again he's playing the akward, shy, un-confident and metrosexual character in this film that he plays in every other film.    Next, you feel frankly unemotionally attached to Scott and the unforgettable female lead role (so unforgettable, I can't even remember the name of the character) that you periodically wonder during the span of the movie why they are magically so enthralled with eachother.  It can't possibly be the female lead's looks - she's about as bland as chicken soup.    Further, the only bit of entertainment in this movie would be the fight scenes.  Visually amazing, and addmittedly creative, the fight scenes are refreshing and quirky, mimicing those fantastical scenes from comic books and graphic novels.  But I digress, the fight scenes are the only shred of entertainment - I had my husband wake me up from naps when the next fight scene was on.  No, I'm serious, I fell asleep.    Basically, the most entertainment you'll get from this movie are the scenes you see in the trailer.  Save yourself the $$$ and skip this dud.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|This is one of my personal favorites!  Comical and gory for a comedy horror!  I have watched this movie at least 30 times!
B0017SWPXY|1.0|Yes, I know that the eBook is less than $9.99.  But the paperback is less than $6.00.<br /><br />This book is going to stay on my \\"to buy in the future if the price goes down\\" list until the eBook is no more expensive than the paperback.  Which is a pity, since the concept behind the book looked interesting.<br /><br />There is no good reason for an eBook to cost MORE than a printed version of the same book (other than publisher greed or publisher attempts to sabotage the eBook market).  I don't know if the publisher is being evil or just incompetent.  Either way, I'm not going to fall for it.<br /><br />(When the price drops, I'll be buying the book.  When I'm done, I'll replace this review with one based on the text, not on the publisher greed set price.)
0688156819|5.0|I was really impressed with the way that the book looked and the condition that it was in. It arrived a day earlier than I was expecting but it came just in time for my sisters birthday. Needless to say, she was really enjoyed it.
0553577123|5.0|I knew the story of Anne Frank but didn't actually read her diary until now, and I'm in my 30s.  I read the book with an aching heart, because I knew what would happen at the end.  The ending of the diary is especially difficult.  When Anne wrote her last entry, she had no idea that it would be her last.

1563890119|2.0|I have read a lot of comics in my time. A lot. I have a closet packed  with them.  I've been collecting them since I was twelve. I've read them all and I know all the plots.<br /><br />So when, upon occasion, someone would ask if I ever read Sandman by Neil Gaiman I would answer \\"No,\\" because that was the truth.<br /><br />Then they would turn on me, point and utter that high-pitched scream a la Donald Sutherland from the 1978 remake Invasion of the Body Snatchers.<br /><br />Then again, this was me. Iconoclastic to a fault and really not giving a whump what people thought. So it wasn't like this behavior directed toward me was new or unusual.  I'm just not a \\"bandwagon\\" kind of guy.<br /><br />Fast forward to a month ago, when I had occasion to finally read this series. I was actually looking forward to it.  I figured, \\"Okay, a lot of people I respect keep telling me I need to read this. I'll give it a try. It should be good.\\"<br /><br />And I did. I read about ten or twelve issues. And then I had to put it aside.<br /><br />I'll give you this. The writing is good -- by comic book standards. Then again that's not a terribly high bar anyway. And, to be fair, I can see where people would be pulled in because compared to other comics the writing was pretty darn good. The artwork? Serviceable. Not great, but serviceable. It had a distinctive flair and of course the covers were themselves eye-catching.<br /><br />But I couldn't read more than that. I didn't care for the Sandman character at all. I didn't like his 90s Japanese punk image one bit. I didn't like his magical WWI gas-themed helmet, his constant brooding, nor his interminable self-reflection. The final nail in the coffin was an issue where he's inside a doll house leaning on the tiny window sill listening to people with chin in hand and a twee smile on his face.<br /><br />WTH. No. Seriously. WTH?<br /><br />I didn't like him. Dream or Morpheus or whatever his name was. The Sandman guy. I didn't like anything about him. I didn't like his origin or his manner or his style or...well, you get the point. And it's kind of hard to read a Superman comic if you grubbin' hate Superman.<br /><br />That's what ultimately sank this comic for me. I didn't like the principle character. I thought he was stupidly rendered. Although, I will give you this. I loved Loved LOVED how people from other cultures would see him manifested as something else related to their own ideas/bias of what the Sandman looked like. If only there had been more of that. A LOT more.<br /><br />But for the people who have to read the comic he's manifested in this dark Japanese punk-rocker style. That garbage was old and tired the day it came out.<br /><br />So, that was it for me. No more Sandman. I tried it and didn't like it. Next time someone asks me if I read this series I'll have to say, \\"I started it, but I thought it sucked canal water.\\"  And now in their eyes I'll be that wretched human bulldog creature who doesn't fit with the rest of comic loving fandom a la Invasion of the Body Snatchers.<br /><br />But I can live with that. Been there. Done that, too.l, you get the point. And it's kind of hard to read a Superman comic if you grubbin' hate Superman.    That's what ultimately sank this comic for me.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Every American needs to see this! I am outraged over the corruption of the big time farmers and FDA. I literally couldn't even look at beef without becoming nauseous after seeing this. My husband watched it and even he refuses to buy anything but farmers market produce or meat if we get stationed back in the States (he is military and we are currently stationed in Europe). He by the way is NOT easily pursueded. That alone speaks volumes for the content of this DVD.
B0025KVLTC|4.0|I loved this album. It is one of the best of Beatles. I loved their song where indian instrument sitar is played in the song. All songs are sweet and lyrics are wondrful. Any fan of Beatles will enjoy and play it again.
0385491026|5.0|Margaret Atwood covers the subject of girl-on-girl bullying with honesty and wit.  The tortures extolled by Cordelia onto, not just the protagonist, but all the girls in their group are similar to what happens in girl cliques all over the world every day.  When girls bully, it is mean and subversive, while boys tend to be forthright and physical in their bullying.  This novel delves right into the manipulative nature of girls and how the girl-group dynamic affects them as they grow into adults.      Highly recommended!
0061544493|3.0|I love victoria beckham's personal style. This book didn't offer what I was expecting (more photos of her looks, more personal style advice, etc.). I did, however, enjoy her product recommendations (skin, hair). I wish she had spoken more about accessories. I was surprised she mentioned nothing about diet or exercise, although this is a style book and not a diet book. Overall, I enjoyed it, but would not recommend it as her style advice is nothing groundbreaking.
B001TH8UUA|2.0|If you're anal about high def, you won't like this cable. I don't mean to be cliché, but you really do get what you pay for. I received this HDMI cable, which is really just a second cable for my Dish Box as I wanted to switch my current Monster HDMI cable to my PS3. As soon as I switched it, I could tell the difference. Talk about going from Monster's smooth crisp graphics, to a more choppy/digitalized picture. I don't like it, and honestly don't recommend it to anyone if you're going to use it on a cable/dish box with the HD channels. However; the upside to this story is that is doesn't look as bad with Blu-ray movies and PS3 games, but I still feel like I may be missing out on a much more awesome picture.
B000IMUYJM|2.0|I just recently saw this film, buying it a) because i love horror/slasher films, b) i LOVE the halloween movies and c) i really liked the remake. This 1974 version is a VERY SLOW and mind numbing movie. it takes a LONG while for anything good to happen, very small amount of blood and gore, not that many kills are fun to watch, NO nudity (unforgivable for a slasher in my book). The remake to me was a better movie(see my reveiw of that film) as it had lots of blood and gore, some nudity and acually explains who billy is and where he came from. in this movie he just goes to the house and starts killing without the veiwer ever know why. I can see the elements borrowed for Halloween and yes halloween did things 10 times BETTER then this movie. Honestly im glad i got it nfor just $8 brand new because if i wouldve paid more i wouldve hated myself. Some people love this movie,some hate it, i for one will never watch this ever again and will rather rewatch the remake.
B002ZG97RE|1.0|I knew this movie had a liberal slant, but I was in a mood for an action movie.  This movie had a lot of great action, but little else.  It's only interesting if you believe the liberal tagline of a manufactured war.  Although I'm a huge fan of the Bourne Trilogy (which is directed by the same man), I was really dissappointed by this propagandist piece of dung.  I think it does a disservice to our troops who are fighting overseas.  I would never see it again and I suggest you don't waste your time!
0307474712|1.0|I do not understand the hype.  It is an easy read - i will grant you that.  But the story is tired and boring.  I am suprised because the book was so well reviewed but i won't even finish it - i am 150 pages in and it is not holding my interest.

I've read the Percy books, which were fun to read and had me clued for two months.<br />Then this book came along, so I picked it up and to my surprise I can admit that Rick is getting better with each book. The way he tells a story is so compelling, that it makes me wish for more. As an author my self, I know what's it like to make a reader excited.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1608607690 For it's a Hard Line The Madness Of Avalon Klynn: Book 2]]
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Received this in a timely manner.  This movie is heart felt and demonstrates what alot of people feel and just how difficult love can be, at times.  Jude Law is a good actor and teamed up with Cameron Diaz the movie is dynamite.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|If the early Paul Thomas Anderson seemed to be channeling the young hyper-energetic Martin Scorsese, 'There Will Be Blood' - a more quiet and thoughtful, but no less amazing and cinematic work - shows Anderson working in the vein of Stanley Kubrick. In place of a hyperactive camera, there is now a coldly, brilliantly observational one. In place of empathetic if damaged characters there are now people drowning in their own poison and lies.<br /><br />He has created a film both boldly theatrical and subtly real, both broadly political and intensely personal. Complicated and intentionally confusing emotionally, with a protagonist gradually subsumed by greed, the film is full of ideas and themes, but feels more mature and focused than Anderson's earlier work, brilliant as that all was. Daniel Day Lewis is amazing, the film looks incredible (if simply shot for an Anderson film), one only sees more and more layers and meanings on repeated viewings.<br /><br />One of the more important films of recent years, this critique of the American dream - both personal, and by extension national - of success, of conquest, and of control is mesmerizing, and ultimately devastating.
B00005JKG5|5.0|Received on first date of estimated arrival and in the condition stated.  This is a very relaxing \\"blast from the past\\" movie.  Good music, sweet romance and I will watch it time and again.
B002VECLVO|5.0|The first thing you'll notice about fashion designer Tom Ford's directorial debut is that it bears none of the usual earmarks of a maiden voyage into moviemaking.  Faithful to the spirit of Christopher Isherwood's modern classic, this beautifully understated film is all the more powerful because of its quiet, controlled delivery. Like the novel, this probably isn't a tale that would appeal to the young. If you're looking for a roller-coaster ride or fireworks, hot sex or neatly packaged happily-ever-afters,  you're not going to find them here. What you will find instead is mature, brilliantly realized art on every conceivable level.     Set in 1962, A Single Man is true to the attitudes and aesthetics of its time while managing to remain completely real and relevant today. It is a tale simply told, yet astonishingly rich in subtext.  I've always believed the concept of perfection to be a myth, so I watched this film twice in succession, the second time putting it under a microscope as I searched for the telltale flaw that would support my theory. I searched in vain. There is not a single misstep in this remarkable piece. Every choice made here is absolutely, inarguably the right one.    In a more than Oscar-worthy performance, Colin Firth plays George, a middle-aged college professor who is grieving for his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode). We see George dress for work and beat the hell out of a frozen loaf of bread, teach a class, share dinner, a dance, and a kiss with his best friend (the always excellent Julianne Moore), fantasize about pissing in the face of a neighbor's obnoxious child, remember his life with Jim via a series of flashbacks, skinnydip with a beautiful and persistent young student (Nicholas Hoult) and wrap up his affairs -- even to the point of buying ammo for his gun and laying out his own burial attire -- as he goes through the motions of a single day, a day that he fully intends to make his last.     \\"Sometimes awful things have their ownkind of beauty,\\" someone tells him.  In that instant, we see what George sees, that in an odd way, this is even true of his grief.  Ford's background in design is evident in the stunning visuals, and an almost subliminal vein of sensuality that has both nothing and everything to do with sexuality runs throughout the course of this piece. Deeply personal without becoming self-indulgent, smart as hell, darkly droll and ultimately ironic, this is a prime example of indie film at its finest.      Simply put, I'm undone.
B0041T52S6|5.0|This movie does everything right.  The casting was perfect, the writing is brilliant (it is based off of a comic that I also HIGHLY recommend), the direction is artistic and beautiful and the soundtrack rocks.  I can understand how someone might not be able to relate to or get this movie, but I it was able to affect me emotionally like few others have.  This is the best movie I have seen so far in 2010, and it is about as fun as a movie could be.
B000VJ271A|5.0|I have sung the role, and seen many productions, including the famed Beverly Sills NYC Opera production.  I am not going through a thorough analysis, but this is simply the best production with the best overall singing I have experienced.  Much the worthwhile purchase.

B004132HZS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series on PBS. Benedict Cumberbach is a wonderful Holmes. A black-clothed Puck, a prankster, eccentric, witty, and quirky.  At the end of the first episode, Watson finally \\"gets him.\\" And it is a touching revelation. The relationship between the two is clearly established in one of their conversations. They are not gay. However, Holmes will not discuss his personal life with his new partner in crime (so to speak!).  The modern twist to the series is terrific. We see the text messages float into focus as the characters use their electronic gadgets. Emails are shown.  Instead of the pipe, Holmes wears nicotine patches, a detail I found hilarious.  The stories are very good, character driven more than plot driven but very entertaining.  What I love about the series is its playfulness; it doesn't take itself too seriously, a novel approach to the iconic sleuth. I found myself chuckling at the \\"in-jokes,\\" references to Conan Doyle's novels or the  PBS series with Jeremy Brett -- IMO the finest Holmes of them all -- or the classic Basil Rathbone.  This series will appeal to the whole family. Like some modern day cartoons, there are some brilliant double entendres that will go over the kids heads and delight the adults.  What a great makeover for the greatest detective of all time!
0596009208|1.0|Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book. This book is discombobulated. Takes you everywhere except into detail on what you're actually doing. I've gone through a chapter, looked back and gone \\"What did I just learn? Absolutely nothing. Am I stupid? Let me re-read that chapter again.\\" Rinse. Cycle. Repeat. After the first 6 chapters of this, I finally gave up. Too many jokes. Forced humor. Not enough substance. If I wanted to laugh, I'd go to a comedy club. I want to learn. Be serious. Scribbles in the margins messing up the source code. Book sucks. And that  \\"Sink A DotCom\\" game? Biggest waste of a chapter. After that I just closed the book, and threw it into the garbage.    If you like TV, buy this book. Plenty of remote controls in this book. lmao

B004B8RWWG|5.0|This drama from AMC is high quality television. The threat is scary enough to keep your attention without taking over the story. The real story, front and center, is how the characters deal with their drastically changed world, other survivors, and their own emotions. The characters are interesting and the story is often surprising. It's excellent edgy fun!
0439023513|4.0|The Hunger Games is one of my favorite YA series. It's complex, deep, and filled with action, suspense, and mystery. This book continues with that theme. It makes you laugh, cry and scream simultaneously. Katniss can't catch a break, especially when the man she loves (but doesn't want to admit it) is held hostage by her nemesis, President Snow. To make matters worse, all of the people she thought she knew are not exactly what they seem. The ones she trusted are changing, the ones she never liked are on her side, and in the end she must count on the one person who was always got her through - herself. I know I'm going to hear a lot of boos, but I'm telling you now that is not a 5 fang rating. It is good and engaging, but it didn't catch and hold my attention from the very beginning like previous books. It started off a little slow, but don't worry, it does catch up, grips you, and doesn't let go until the end. The problem I really have is the way things were left. Without giving away too much, a major character drops from the scene towards the end and is never heard of again. This left me with a bad taste in my mouth. After so much interaction and craziness this character has been through (I must give him/her credit although he/she is not one of my faves), I think there should have been further closure and not just the \\"I'm leaving cause you are going to be forever pissed at me\\" ending that was presented. I also felt cold with the way they portrayed Katniss's mom in the end. Sorry to be vague, but I don't want to let the cat out of the bag for all those that didn't read it. I did like the final wrap up with all the other characters. I must admit that this book had me crying like a baby towards the end, and cheering in others. It is definitely an emotional roller coaster of a read, with action packed scenes and suspense that we have come to expect from the series. It is a definite must read, although it does have its flaws.

073935275X|5.0|I read the 3 books and loved the story.  My husband likes to listen to the tapes while he does his craft work.  He was completely captured, as I was with the books.  He had to keep  going and could not stop just like I could not put the book down.  I plan to listen to the story when we go on long trips.  We could not bet the tapes in Canada so I ordered them from Amazon and the price was good.   If you like action and suspence. This is GREAT
B0042AEOG0|4.0|I've decided to post my review here, in addition to some commentary about Mimi's famous whisper that seems to annoy so many of you in Amazonland.<br /><br />1)Why does Mariah whisper? Because of those famous vocal nodules that produce the dog-whistle notes that register as high up as G-sharp, a sound usually associated with dolphins, of all things! (google it, I kid you not.) The medical miracle of those nodules differs when she sings from head voice (in her case a whisper, breathing through the nose) and chest voice (producing the mezzo-alto range of her \\"belting\\" which comes from breath at the top of the diaphragm, pushing through the lungs.) Belting can only be sustained for about 2 hours before vocal chords become sore. I, too, studied opera, and am a soprano so this is my best explanation. These same nodules also sustain the trademark melisma (google that, too) that allows Mariah to stretch one or two phrases into many notes, frequently up and down in a given scale/octave. It's a combination of vocal inflection, breath control, and the magical oddity inherent in her own style, often imitated but never equalled. I love it, so no complaints from me.<br /><br />2)Most singers would opt to have those nodules lasered off from their vocal chords, but she has made it her trademark. Listen very carefully to her speaking voice, and you will see the rasping quality \\"peek\\" out from time to time. While magnificent, Mariah herself has stated that she didn't enjoy the discipline of vocal training and I can tell you it's a commitment like no other. So, what you hear, while fantastic, is essentially an untrained voice in the \\"classically schooled\\" sense. Regardless, there is much flavor and tone in these songs and Christmas music is enjoyable, in my book, any way you slice it. If any sopranos/mezzos/altos would like to debate me? I welcome your review. And now, for my review.<br /><br />This is nothing like her 1994 classic, but that is NOT a bad thing. She has grown, she has changed as an artist and a soon-to-be-Mommy! How fitting is it that Jesus and his birth is so much a part of the album's landscape as she goes through her first pregnancy? This fact is tender and moving on its own.<br /><br />Let us remember that Tommy Mottola pushed her through record after record. Mariah released 6 albums in 6 years from 1990-1995 without a break, numerous appearances and three mini-world tours not only to fulfill her contract, but obviously to make living with Tommy easier. She was pushed hard by Sony execs during those years, so give her a break! The original album will always stand on its own merit. This record is lush, jazzy, and very classic in the \\"old-time\\" variety show sense of the 1970's, and I am old enough to remember that since she and I are the same age. True fans get who she is now, not the packaged \\"pop princess\\" that Sony wanted the world to see. She has nothing to prove vocally, we know she can hit the high notes. She enjoys every note of these songs and the arrangements musically, are spectacular!<br /><br />\\"Charlie Brown Christmas (Christmas Time is Here)\\" originally recorded by a children's choir for Vince Guaraldi of Snoopy fame, is my favorite track. I have heard everyone from Patti Austen to Patti LaBelle to the Manhattan Transfer sing this song both live and on record, and Mimi gets it right: sweet, jazzy, gentle and reminiscent of snowflakes falling on a mid-December day, a soft wind tapping at the window.<br /><br />The true test of Christmas music is if you clamor to play it during the summer, the spring, or any time that is not near November or December. This records meets that mark.<br /><br />Like the original, there is a respectful spirituality that speaks to the gospel experience, but also a childlike playfulness that we all remember while waiting for Santa, stirring hot cocoa and decorating our trees.

B003ZSH606|5.0|I have to preface my review by saying that I have been listening to Jamiroquai for many years.  This band is, without a doubt, my favorite.  I literally counted the days for this album to come out and was astounded as how well rounded and ambitious it is.  So many different sounds and feelings contained within this album.  Seasoned listeners will be disappointed if they expect a `Dynamite' or `Funk Odyssey' sound.  However, if you keep your mind open and realize that this is not about keeping the same sound, it is about Jay Kay and Jamiroquai showing that they are so much more than what we have heard, you will adore it.....    Rock Dust Light Star -The title track was one that was released early on You Tube by a few eager fans holding camera phones.  I was so very excited to hear this on the album however; this is actually one of my least favorite songs.  There is some sloppy guitar work in this one and the background singers seem to overpower Jay Kay on too many occasions.  I do like the track love how toward the end Jay Kay lets go a bit but again, the background singers seem to overpower him too much and his velvet voice gets lost too often in the noise.    White Knuckle Ride-I really enjoy this song, I do wish that it had not been released as the first single however, I understand why it was.  This is probably the most `main stream' song on the album, consistent beats, and a very VERY catchy chorus.  Same backup singers on this one, but they take a back seat to Jay Kay.  This one is destined to be remixed (and remixed...and remixed....and remixed).      Smoke and Mirrors-I was not a huge fan of this one when I first heard it, I still don't think that it comes close to what the band is capable of.  That being said, the more I listen to it the more I come to appreciate the horns, mellow mood it creates, and smooth tone of Jay Kay.  There is something that works about this song, even though I really don't want it to.  There is an almost jazz feeling to this one.  It picks up toward the end and makes me wish that the first half matched the tempo and feeling of the second.      All Good in the Hood - One of the better songs on the album.  Very peppy with a very catch chorus (I dare you not to smile when Jay Kay declares that it's \\"all good in the hood tonight\\"!).  Disco type feel to this one.  Jay Kay's voice is a bit distorted (I am sure there is a technical term but it almost sounds like he is talking through an old style telephone).  I can imagine that this was a close contender for the first single release due to the `pop' nature of it.      Hurtin'-This song really showcases what Jay Kays voice can do.  Gritty and sounding well worn (in a good way, not the three-pack-a-day way), you really can hear through his voice the pain that created this song.  Often overpowering, the instrumentals take a background on this one and allow Jay Kay to start to stretch himself a bit vocally.      Blue Skies - This is the other single that was released early.   A very laid back melody with a very typical sound.  I am not a huge fan when Jamiroquai tries to do a song that sounds `radio ready'.  They are so much better than that.  However, this song does work and winds up coming out as a beautiful ballad.  Jay Kay sounds FLAWLESS on this song, so smooth and sweet.  I have never been a fan of their slower songs but this one does the trick, doesn't sound at all like them, but it does work.      Lifeline - The first time I listened to this song I really did not like it all.  It is now probably my second or third favorite.  Heavy on horns again (I adore when they bring horns in on the songs, it just adds that little jazz edge that I love).  The chorus and verse and totally different from each other at the beginning, it almost seems like they are from two different songs, at first it really annoyed me.  Now I cannot imagine the song any other way.  Soft strings and horns accompany Jay Kay on the verse and the song breaks into a bit more rowdy almost `showtunes' type of chorus.  These two parts come into a nice unison toward the end of the song when it's all let loose, then backs off once more to allow the strings and piano take over a bit, this is a wonderful, beautiful, and unusual arrangement.      She's a Fast Persuader - I am on the fence on this song.  It is one of the more up tempo songs on the album and sometimes I listen to it and really like it, other times I just want to skip past it.  Very fast beats, slowing at the chorus which transitions into an almost dreamlike quality.  Again, the verse and chorus don't seem to match on this one but, as always, Jay Kay makes it work with a result that I find tapping my foot to.    Two Completely Different Things -this is BY FAR my favorite song on the album!!!  The first few times I skipped by it not thinking much of it but it has (after only two weeks) taken the top spot on my ipod for most played.  Extremely smooth opening to this song, Jay Kay's voice takes center stage in this one and does not disappoint.  The song begins as a mid tempo ballad of sorts and about halfway transitions into a bridge and finale that still gives me goose bumps, this is one of the only songs where is seems Jay Kay really lets his voice shine and reminds his long time fans that while this album is more subdued, his voice is still is filled with the same gorgeous soul that carried him this far.  Heavy on the horns and with catchy and beautiful lyrics.  This song, at least for me, is the crown jewel of the album.     Goodbye to my Dancer - A very sweet reggae inspired song.  Very Caribbean sounding and somewhat unusual for Jamiroquai, this is a great stretch for the band.  Different enough that you know they are going outside of their comfort box but not enough that you don't recognize a lot of the guitar and smooth transitions that the band does so well at.  You will either love this one or hate it, but at least listen until the chorus as that brings the song together with a nicebow.     Never Gonna Be Another - Think about a quiet evening, cashmere PJ's (of course, since this is Jamiroquai you also would be wearing a really cool headdress) glass of wine, cuddled up by a crackling fireplace with the one you love, and then add one of the most mellow and gorgeous songs on the album. Enough said.    Hey Floyd - This song rubbed me the wrong way the first few times I heard it, I gave it another shot a few days later.  As it turns out it is a really good song.  Again, it carries a very Carribbean sound with it, but once again, the chorus brings it all to a different level.  Heavy on instrumentals and very dramatic, I adore the quick lyrics and accompanying strings on the chorus.  Give this one more than one chance, it needs it but once you realize what Jay Kay was trying to get across you will appreciate it that much more.
B000V5TV22|2.0|I have been using a BU-353 in my previous car for approximately 4 years.  It had always worked great and it was placed in the rear window of the car directly above the brake light.  In the end it had died and it wasn't a big deal to me since I was planning on replacing the car as well.      So I had replaced the car and with it created a new computer for the car.  I bought a new BU-353 back in April 2010 to handle the GPS.  I used it for a little bit of testing and then the project was put on the back burner for some months.  When it came time to get started again the GPS no longer worked on either of my PCs.  I ordered a new one (October 2010) just to be sure that it wasn't a driver problem; the new one worked immediately with no changes.  I proceeded to install the new one with my car computer and it worked for about 2 weeks longer then it too had died.    Environment isn't the issue as the weather is very mild and the GPS is inside of the vehicle.  I'm not sure what has happened with their quality control in recent times but I've had 3 of these die within the last year.  I'm now shopping for a different brand of USB GPS as I have lost all confidence in this device.    As a note to others wondering if the same thing is happening to them: None of the GPS devices actually stopped mapping a COM port on the PC.  Every single time the COM port would still be created.  The problem was that no software could find the existence of a GPS on the COM port not even the software available from US GlobalSat for testing the GPS.
B00064MW6K|5.0|Wow, does Halle Berry brings life to this character in a way I have never seen Catwoman. I could feel her power radiate off the screen. When it was over I wanted to see it over and over. She had her body and her mind right in the character. This Catwoman, Halle Berry, will always be known for her walk/prowl.<br /><br />It is definitely on my list as a keeper to purchase on DVD! Sharon Stone plays a great female villain. I felt my movie money was well spent for once. All women have a Catwoman inside them just waiting to come out, Purr!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This Media should set a standard for the leaders of Free Nations. Many people have a Love / Hate relationship with the things that this man did. Only by passing on the lessons of his life, distilled into a format that only takes a breif moment to learn so much in so short of time, He has left us great wisdom to learn and live by. Some people dislike history, but this leads into current events and the mordern world as we know it today. I would recommend that all Americans watch this film and share it with as many people as possible.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I suggest the entire Drizzt series, so far I have read most of the series once and actually am going back through it again in ebook format now.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This movie is not for the easily offended, or those who want to impress people by their deep moral values and look down on those that realize that this is just a MOVIE and that it's intended as entertainment. In my opinion, most comic book based movies suck, so I had very low expectations for \\"Kick Ass\\". I thought my fears were justified until Big Daddy and Hit Girl appear on the screen. What makes this movie memorable, and the reason why \\"Kick Ass\\" will remain a cult classic for years to come, is those two characters.<br /><br />Big Daddy is a mentally disturbed man, set on revenge, whose idea of showing love for his daughter is to fire low velocity bullets at her while she wears a bulletproof vest instead of high velocity rounds. He molds Hit Girl into a remorseless killing machine who can also swear like a sailor in a Manila brothel. Despite the patent immorality of Big Daddy's education of his daughter, his love for her, and her devotion for him, are never in doubt. Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz make the loving relationship between the two believable despite the obvious disfunctionality of the family.<br /><br />Although the movie is called \\"Kick Ass\\" after the titular hero, Hit Girl is the real superhero of the movie. She steals the picture from the first scene she is in. Despite her cussing and murderous ways, Hit Girl is still just a little girl at heart, who just wants to please her daddy. She is not immoral, because she has been raised with a different set of moral values. The violence she perpetrates is over the top, and at times is creative. You will see ways of killing criminals you have never seen before. Hit-Girl has been vilified by crusading movie critics, but she will go down as one of the greatest anti-hero movie characters ever. She belongs with \\"The-Man-With-No-Name\\" played by Clint Eastwood, and \\"The Terminator\\" played by Arnold Schwarzenegger as a ruthless and amoral character that you actually cheer for.<br /><br />I can't believe I'm going tosay this... but I'm actually looking forward for the sequel.
B0017XOF5A|3.0|I love the entire stargate series but this one was a bit of a letdown overall. Ohh well, at least I have it to complete my collection on the shelf. Wife loves that :P
0307591549|5.0|There's a reason why everyone seems to be giving this five stars.  If you're looking for a well-written, non-smarmy, non-new agey self-help book filled with simple, research-based ways you can improve your life in significant ways, this is the book for you.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I think that this has to be the best of any of the newer ST movies. The background storyline and action was incredible. Can't wait for the next one to be released!
142313494X|5.0|At first I will be honest I had no desire to read this book, but my good friend told me i had to she promised me I would love it, and boy was she right.  The minute I picked up the book I couldn't put it down.  Reading the first chapter I found myself not really interested in the book, but once chapter 2 started I couldn't stop.  I love how the writer has used many of Greek Myths and put them into the current world.  I would recomment this book to all that love adventure and magic.  This book I would consider to be a must read.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This has to be the darkest of all the batman movies so i would not let little kids watch it but it was awesome!!!
B002ZG98J6|1.0|Well I read the book and absolutley loved, so I was very dissapointed when I saw the movie.  I do like all the actors they got for the characters.  For the first ten minutes of the movie the pretty much stuck to the book, however after those ten minutes I honestly have no idea where the rest of the story came from.  Not one scene that I was so anxious to see that was in the book, was not there.  The movie itself was ok, I think I would have enjoyed more if I hadn't read the book.  For everyone that as not seen the movie I would recommend for you to watch the movie before you read the book to try and avoid dissapointment.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|I love Logitech products and have their (old) G15 gaming keyboard, the one with 18 side keys instead of the newer model with fewer keys. I tried on multiple occasions to use this G13 keypad with my computer, mainly WoW, but never got used to it. The G15 just is too easy to easy to use.    As a side note, a friend that has a normal keyboard LOVES his G13 keypad so maybe f you do not have a nice gaming keyboard like the G15 this is a good idea.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|All I can say was I loved it and finished the book in 1 day !
B001BVRNPW|3.0|I think the writers were trying to milk the show with these last couple movie releases. The series was better but these are still worth a watch. Just do not expect too much and it will all be good.
B0001I561E|4.0|I was very happy with my purchase of the Aladdin DVD for my granddaughter.  She was thrilled!  It came promptly and was in excellent condition.  Thank you!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|The action and comedy in this movie was just what i expected, really good. I think the first Iron Man was just a tad better though.
B002OG5GT8|4.0|This little amp is a great buy for the money. Now granted, it is not a high end desktop amp, but it does exactly what I wanted it for and that is to boost the bass in most of the music I listen to. I'm not a bass-head, but if you think about it, the bass line is that part of the song that moves you. I also like the fact that I can decrease the volume on my iPod and use the volume control on this little gizmo. This is my second one of these (I sold the first one when I sold my Grado's)and I realized as soon as I sold it that I missed it. The packaging and product presentation are first rate. This is one neat little amp.
0061537969|5.0|This book was simply amazing. Enzo is such an easy character to become attached to. Denny is so easy to relate with. Enzo is a fabulous and well-written narrator, making this book well paced, being both plot driven and beautifully written. This book is a piece of art, although straying from standard \\"conventions\\" of literary fiction by making the wording simple and easy to understand. The novel teaches us so much about how to be human, through the eyes of a dog! I cried during the last twenty pages. The story of Enzo struck a chord with my emotions and pulled me into the book, involving me on a deeper level than just printed words on paper.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I got hooked on Dexter it's 1st season when it was on my local channel 7.  I was very upset when it got moved to Showtime, because I don't get that.  I have been buying each season and sharing it with my friends and family, so I've made more fans for Dexter, but still won't spring for Showtime.   I highly recommend this show it's a concept that I really like.
B003ZEQMIC|1.0|I received the case and the second CD with the specials on it but did not receive the movie.  I wrote through Amazon twice to get some satisfaction and never heard a word back from the vendor.  I am kind of shocked to be treated like this as I have ordered through Amazon many times and have never had someone be so uncaring as to not even reply when I have sent two emails about my dissatisfaction.  I will never order from this vendor again.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I bought these after my guitarist picked up a pair. For recording with a digital multitrack they really can't be beat. They are comfortable, not too heavy, even has a built in 1/8 to 1/4 inch adapter so it will work in ALL your devices! The unit is a little bass heavy, nothing a little more midrange in the mix can't cure. Sure you aren't getting the sound you'd get with expensive high dollar headphones, but for the price they are a steal!
B002VECM6S|4.0|A feel good sports movie. Not totally authentic, but I love the quirky characters and the cameos by actual college coaches. I will watch it several times a year!
B002VECM72|5.0|This is an excellent film of a great story, one that was literally unimaginable just a few short years ago.
0060730552|5.0|When I picked this book up I could not set it down. It may help if you have had some experience on a rope as there is frequent use of technical terms (climbing/technique)but I have lent this to non-climbing friends and they have also enjoyed it. On all occasions it gets read and returned rather quickly - and discussions follow.<br /><br />If you are a climber and have been on borderline epic climb the book is simply a must. If you are interested in mountaineering it is also a brilliant read can be motivating in a strange way. Of course the DVD also exists - but as the rule goes, read the book first.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00020X94W Touching the Void]]
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I'm all about characters and it's not that the characters in these books aren't interesting...I just get addicted to one then get frustrated when I have stop and start following a whole other story. And there are SOOO many different stories! I find myself wanting to cheat and flip to the end just to find out what's happening. I know that really means that it's interesting and I should be glad I've found something that enthralling, but it starts to get irritating in this book and gets really old as the series progresses. I'm not even sure there's a plot out there. I really wish the kindle version would make the maps more legible but I am looking forward to the HBO series.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small, very light and very effective. I appreciate the ceramic finisher, as I have always used older CPUs (with those nearly perfect ceramic tops) to finish my blades. My Benchmade tanto knife was back to scalpel-sharpness in about 5 minutes.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This is a wonderful, tender love story. Unlike a Nicholas Spark's movie, they both lived in the end.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I was blown away the first time I watched avatar, and of course I wanted to own the dvd.  But at the time of the original dvd release the public was informed the special features and extended version wouldn't be out until this winter.  That's why I don't understand all the griping about the second release. There are a LOT of people who didnt want to wait that long and bought the bare bones edition, but that was an informed choice, just as others chose to wait.  Now my waiting is over and I am happily looking forward to Nov16 to see the nuts and bolts on how they made this groundmaking film<br />I have no doubt the wait will have been well worth it
B0009P5YXO|3.0|I was hoping that it was metal instead of plastic, but what could you expect? I was hoping for more than one sound effect, but what could you expect? I was hoping it would be easier to assemble, but what could you expect? Lower your expectations, and you won't be disappointed.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|I would rate this movie as 4 stars out of 5. Jim Carrey was excellent as Scrooge, and the animation and effects were top notch, although I felt that the use of 3D was a little forced. I did find it strange that they really didn't update the dialogue to present day from the standpoint that I felt children would be confused by it, but if you are a fan of Dicken's work it really is a treat that they didn't Disneyize the dialogue so that it would appeal to today's generation
0981951244|5.0|I bought this books some days ago and already read it once and listened to the audio version twice, I know that won't be the last time. Darren is brilliant at coming down to what really counts - the simple things, that we need to practice 1000 times until they become our retuals to really master our lives. What I appreciate most about the Compound Effect is the fact that it covers a lot of topics: from business, self development, relationsships to health & vitality; and carries the message in various stories that build the bridge between where I am now and where I want to be. This helps me envision the road ahead and gives me the guts to follow through.    For all you out there who really want to make a change in your life, this resource is a must-have. Read it, implement it & enjoy the rewards!    In 6 months straight I am going to post another review to let you know how this book has supported me in realising my dreams.
031603438X|5.0|Excellent book. Keef really spells it out. Amazing life story told by the man himself along with a cast of friends and associates.
B0044IJ1S6|2.0|Maybe i'm in the minority here but this footage sucks.  To be honest, this has to be the worst DM live DVD I have ever seen.  First of all, the setlist sucks.  Besides a few obvious great choices, this is a miss.  I know there were some other songs performed on this tour that should have been on here.  For example, \\"Strangelove\\", \\"A Question Of Lust\\" and some of the better tracks from the latest album.  Strangelove has never appeared on a live DVD of DM, except for an excerpt on 101.  The camera work is ridiculous.  Everyone complained that the Touring the Angel DVD gave them a headache....well, wait till you see this.  I spent more time watching the crowd take pictures than i did watching the band.  And what is up with all the blurry focus of Dave singing while your focused on fan's hands taking pictures. Over and Over and Over again.  I couldn't beleive it.  Half of the concert is filmed from the waste up like you are actually in the audience.  Well, i wasn't and i bought this to see a professionally filmed concert.  Not a concert through the eyes of  an audience member.  And enough of the camera filming from behind the wall.  It looks ridiculous , like your peeping through window blinds.  Also, i found the vocals on many songs to be drawn out by the music.  I have waited for ever for this DVD to come out and was excited that it would be released on Blu Ray.  I am so very disappointed.  I really am. And I can not beleive Martin Gore ok'd it's release.  This is terrible.
0061900656|4.0|I think this is a very age appropriate book for a 2-4 yr old.  Easy concepts to understand.  My 3 yr old likes this book very much.

B002VPE1AW|1.0|This movie is nothing more than an ultra liberal cliche of the evil military conquering the poor indigenous lifeforms hidden behind pretty effects and imagery.  There isn't much action but more spiritual phoney balonie.    Do gooder liberals save the trees from the evil military, GIMME A BREAK.    Shame on you James Cameron, you obviously drank too much of the liberal hollywood kool aid.    I would like to see this liberal do gooder and the wimps who wrote this drivel in the fields of Bastogne, the islands of Pelileu, the beaches of Omaha and Utah, Da Nang and most recently Fallujah.    They would cringe in their pants while the REAL ACTUAL soldiers saved their useless behinds while bringing freedom to the opressed peoples in each campaign.  This cliche of the evil military is old and stale.  I purposely chose Veteran's day to write this review about this anti military detritus.  Hollywood used to make movies that honored the sacrifices they make, what happened to that?    The creature sound effects were not even original. The growls were borrowed from Jurassic Park creatures(T Rex and Raptor growls).  The pretty effects did not sell this to me. I need more than effects to like a movie. Not a shallow plot and hammed up acting.  Dancing with Smurfs has been seen before.  This is by far the most overrated movie I have ever seen(fortunately once is enough for me).
B0034G4P7G|1.0|Poorly done film.  It is very difficult to watch a dark and murky film.  One young man left theatre because of it's poor visibility.  The audio was terrible.  Much of the dialogue was drowned out by the background noise in film, whether it was music or other people talking and difficult to follow due to lack of clarity in sound.  Person who came with me fell asleep from boredom.    Basically all I got from it was there once was a group of well educated young men, for the most part, enrolled in a prestigious college who were immature, arrogant, self centered, pretentious and emotionally dysfunctional.  Some of them made a lot of money, as have other corporate self serving human beings like the men from Enron. The President of the College at the time was portrayed as arrogant, distant, pretentious and self serving as well.      Cannot recommend this film, not worth the $.  Wait for cable if you must see it. Perhaps the book would be better.  May look into it.
006112429X|5.0|This book took my breath away. I am still haunted by much of it, particularly  the last punch, which I never saw coming. Some have criticized the characters as unrealistic, self pitying,etc., but I found them all too human, In situations where life goes horribly off course from what we expected, it is impossible to say how we would react until we actually have to navigate that unexpected course. Eva, mother of teenage mass murderer, Kevin lives a nightmare that nothing could ever have prepared her for. She dissects Kevin's life through letters to her estranged husband. Although this will not change things, and some find her re-hashing of his life whiny and pointless, it is the only way she can begin to move forward in a life that is beyond what she might have ever dreamed. I faced a few situations in my life that I would not have thought I'd find myself in and I didn't always deal with them in the \\"right\\" way. Until you walk in someone else's shoes... Read this book, it is difficult and will haunt you but it's very thought provoking and well written.

B003XSSR4W|5.0|Monday 25 October 2010 has seen 14 of the 'Apple' label albums remastered and reissued alongside \\"Come And Get It\\" - a first-time-ever label 'Best Of'. This reissue is one of them.<br /><br />Apple 5099964244020 breaks down as follows (61:50 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 12 are the Stereo LP \\"Straight Up\\" released late December 1971 in the USA on Apple SW-3387 and 4 February 1972 on Apple SAPCOR 19 in the UK (it reached number 31 on the American Billboard Top 100).<br /><br />Tracks 13 to 18 are bonus tracks exclusive to this 2010 CD reissue:<br />\\"I'll Be The One\\" is a band composition that was once muted as a possible UK Apple single (no number allocated), but never released (13)<br />\\"Name Of The Game\\" (a Pete Ham song) was also considered for a single (Apple 35), but again never issued (14)<br />\\"Baby Blue\\" (a Pete Ham song) was also considered for a UK single (Apple 42), but again withdrawn. It was, however, released in the USA on Apple 1844 in April 1972 and rose to number 14 on the Billboard charts. With added reverb on the drums, it's presented here as the 'US Single Mix' - its B-side is the album track \\"Flying\\" (15)<br />\\"Baby Please\\" (Pete Ham/Joey Molland/Mike Gibbins song) is previously unreleased (16)<br />\\"No Good At All\\" (Tom Evans song) is previously unreleased (17)<br />\\"Sing For The Song\\" (Tom Evans song) is previously unreleased (18)<br /><br />Requiring extra payment, there are also 7 more tracks available via Digital Download from iTunes or Amazon - \\"Money (Earlier Version)\\", \\"Flying (Earlier Version)\\", \\"Perfection (Earlier Version)\\", \\"Suitcase (Earlier Version)\\", \\"Sweet Tuesday Morning (Earlier Version)\\", \\"Mean Mean Jemima\\" and \\"Loving You\\" (see either site for cost details).<br /><br />BOOKLET/PACKAGING:<br />The front & rear of the original vinyl LP sleeve is reproduced on the gatefold card sleeve, while noted writer and music lover ANDY DAVIS does the new liner notes for the booklet (they're all a disappointingly weedy 12 pages long - EMI pushes the boat out again people). But with what little text he has been afforded, Davis does at least fill it with properly informative details - and there are black & white studio shots of the band - PETE HAM, TOM EVANS, JOEY MOLLAND and MIKE GIBBINS.  It's cute, but you do wish there was more...<br /><br />PLAYERS/CONTENT:<br />The album was famously produced by studio wizard TODD RUNDGREN - except for \\"I'd Die, Babe\\", \\"Name Of The Game\\" and \\"Suitcase\\" - which had GEORGE HARRISON at the controls (he also played Guitar on \\"I'd Die, Babe\\"). The 'bonus tracks' were produced by GEOFF EMERICK of Beatles/Abbey Road fame - except for \\"Baby Blue (US Single Mix)\\" which was Rundgren.<br /><br />SOUND:<br />The same team that handled the much-praised 09/09/09 Beatles remasters have done this too - GUY MASSEY, STEVE ROOKES, SAM OKELL and SIMON GIBSON. The audio quality is BEAUTIFUL - a massive improvement - makes you reassess a lot of the songs.<br /><br />Their 2nd album \\"No Dice\\" from 1970 is a gem, but Badfinger surpassed even that with \\"Straight Up\\" - leagues ahead of their patchy 1969 debut both in terms of songwriting quality and sheer polish. This is immediately evident on the two Pete Ham openers - \\"Take It All\\" and \\"Baby Blue\\" - the Todd Rundgren production values on the guitars and drums now so clear. \\"Money\\" with its \\"buys you freedom\\" lyrics has great chunky guitars and harmony vocals, while \\"Flying\\" sounds not unlike 10cc circa \\"The Original Soundtrack\\". The liner notes tell us that Beatle George was literally dancing in the studio during the recording of \\"I'd Die, Babe\\" - it's easy to hear why - it's a catchy little ditty and similar to own songwriting style.<br /><br />Joey Molland's keyboard funk of \\"Suitcase\\" opened Side 2 of the original album and talks of the weariness of being on the road forever without too much success (lyrics above). The lovely America-type acoustic tune \\"Sweet Tuesday Morning\\" follows - it was the B-side to the only single issued off the album in the UK (\\"Day After Day\\" - 7 January 1972 on APPLE 42). But then you're hit with a triple-whammy of Badfinger songwriting excellence - \\"Day After Day\\", \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"Perfection\\". All three offer up different facets of the band's capabilities - the lovely \\"Day After Day\\" is essentially a mid-tempo ballad from Pete Ham and that it wasn't a huge UK chart hit is sort of inexplicable, \\"Sometimes\\" is a Joey Molland rocking gem that sounds like The James Gang on a roll, while the thinking man's strum of \\"Perfection\\" comes closest to that Big Star comparison of out-and-out genius. As if that isn't enough, you get superb guitar playing on the Tom Evans album finisher \\"It's Over\\" - it's all so shockingly good, it really is. And like almost all of the releases in this series, the bonus tracks are impressive too rather than being superfluous. Very, very good indeed...<br /><br />Niggles - in order to give a fuller review, I paid for the extra 7 download alternate versions - and typically their quality is superb - must haves. I burned them onto a CD-R and they clocked in at 23:59 minutes - when you add that onto 61:50, you see that they could all have easily fitted onto 1CD. I've Bear Family titles that regularly push past 85 minutes with no deterioration in sound, so it's a crappy scam to have us fork out seven more pounds for versions EMI know fans will want - and badly. The gatefold card sleeve is nice to look at for sure, but the booklet and overall packaging feel lightweight (what EMI could get away with). The CD should also have one of those gauze inner bags to protect it - a problem that no record company seems to want to acknowledge (scuffing and damage). The packaging issues are minor points I know, but this otherwise brilliant reissue is docked a star for creaming fans on the download front.<br /><br />One Star or Five - Badfinger have always divided people - many calling them one of the great overlooked bands of the period - others calling them lightweight (most of the first album and bits of the second). You will not call them the latter after hearing \\"Straight Up\\" - it's a crafted gem.<br /><br />To sum up - recommended - especially given the brilliance of the album itself, the massive improvement in sound quality and those shockingly good bonus tracks. Shame about those downloads though...<br /><br />PS: see also my reviews for other releases in this October 2010 series:<br />\\"That's The Way God Planned It\\" (1969) and \\"Encouraging Words\\" (1970) by Billy Preston, \\"Doris Troy\\" (1970), \\"James Taylor\\" (1968), \\"Is This What You Want?\\" (1969) by Jackie Lomax, \\"No Dice\\" (1970), \\"Magic Christian Music\\" (1969) and \\"Ass\\" (1974) by Badfingerwhammy of Badfinger songwriting excellence - \\"Day After Day\\", \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"Perfection\\".

031606792X|1.0|So badly written it's embarrassing. Pace is boring. Characters agonise over everything in a thoroughly tedious manner. The fantastical is turned into the totally mundane.     Twilight was the best book of this series, pacy and well characterised and likeable. Every book since has got increasingly more and more badly written.     Is Meyer so famous now that she is out of the control of a good editor?
0786915749|4.0|Okay, I admit it. Back in junior high school, I was a gaming nerd. But before that, I had been a fan of fantasy literature. So, when the Dragonlance novels came along, it was like manna from heaven, this brand new mixture of Dungeons & Dragons and the fantasy novel.<br /><br />One of the things my young self enjoyed much about Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the first of the Dragonlance novels and one of (if not the) first of the novels based upon a role-playing game, was that explanations for the game rules actual found their way into the story and fit quite naturally.<br /><br />The story itself was also decent, and the characters were iconic and interesting. Actually, I felt the characters were one of the big strengths of these original Dragonlance books.<br /><br />But no, this was not great literature. Not even great fantasy literature. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great. I have read worse over the years, but I've read a lot better, too.<br /><br />Readers who enjoy media-tie-in novels, especially those based upon roleplaying games, can thank this book for really kicking off the whole trend. Unfortunately for writers, over the years there has grown a stigma about stories based upon role-playing games; it seems a lot of editors are not interested in such stories, especially if those stories are based upon the writers' own gaming experiences. That's fine with me, because I usually don't write directly from my gaming experiences and besides, there are some editors who do enjoy such tales and are willing to buy them.
0765316897|5.0|The best book in the trilogy and a very good series.  Lots of twists and unpredictable moves. When you read it you don't feel as if you are consuming atium. The magic system is brilliant. Inventive and unusual. I love Vin. I think she is the best character I have come across in fantasy in the last 5 years. Guess I am still in love with her :blush:  The ending is scary but fitting - good ending.  I am pleased that I have read the trilogy. Refreshing. Very recommended.
006112429X|5.0|I have always felt sad for the parents of the children who commit terrible acts against others and are the focus of T.V. and newspapers. That drew me to this excellent novel that is unlike anything I have read before. It is so beautifully thought out that it always wraps up anything that came before, usually in a shocking way.     I did find one bothersome fault with the characters. Kevin did things throughout the book that I doubted a child/teen is capable of accomplishing at those ages. Just too sophisticated and with too much planning involved. I also found the little sister a bit TOO angelic as the balance to Kevin's evil. However, that said, what a great read!!! Imaginative, brutal, clever, insightful and wonderful prose!
1932907009|1.0|Sitting across a Hollywood executive who holds this book as \\"THE BIBLE\\", I finally understood why movies fail at the box office. By using the same old formula, like the one Snyder suggests in his book, we are subject to the same old thing over and over again. Screenwriters are well aware of the likeable factor their characters have to have, but Save the Cat, does not reveal anything new we haven't seen from writers a lot more accomplished than Snyder. This book is overrated and is one more way of encapsulating writer's creativity into a magic formula.
0553805371|3.0|Hawking and Mlodinow's The Grand Design is primarily a defense of M-Theory, which the authors describe as \\"the unified theory Einstein was hoping to find\\" (p. 181), and brief explanations of some of the theories which comprise it.  Hawking seems to defend M-theory by asserting that it replaces the need for consideration of a prime mover or first cause.  It's an odd little book because Hawking turns relativity and quantum physics into a theological argument to knock god or the need for god out of the universe by substituting the \\"laws\\" of physics and trying to prove conclusively that the universe and we \\"just are\\" through the interactions of these laws.  It's a grandly designed argument to show that something can come from nothing and that one does not have to take the big bang hypothesis for the beginning of the universe \\"on faith,\\" answering the argument by theists that science is a form of religion.  The opposite of faith perhaps is knowledge, or at least Hawking seems to think it is, and his argument against faith in the \\"big bang\\" is just another way the reader senses the theological nature of this treatise. Hawking approaches physics in this book with the reverence of a priest and the lucidity of the experienced preacher.  M-theory, I guess, is the quantum genesis myth for the universe and what came after, exchanging the Biblical account with the unified theory account.  Those of us, however, who do not understand quantum physics will just have to continue to accept on faith that the universe sprang from nothing and after billions of years we were because, despite Hawking's efforts, we still lack the knowledge necessary to comprehend the argument from quantum physics.  The theological nature of the work is intriguing; even the title, probably by intention, evokes theological writings.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story 3 is awesome!!  It continues the story of toys Woody, Buzz, Jesse, The Potatoes (Mr & Mrs.) and the rest of Andy's toys.  And is all grown up so what happens to his toys?  Very fun adventure with the original characters every one has grown to love and a few new ones too!!    My son saw this in the movies with his daddy and we knew we would be getting it for Christmas because he loves the first two movies!  He saw Toy Story 3 before getting the other 2 for his birthday in September.  I ordered it from Amazon (for a great price!)  and it arrived within 2 days.  I couldn't wait for him to get it and ended up letting him open up the box three days later!    The first time he watched it he was a little weary of it due to the fact that Andy was \\"big\\" and wanted to watch Part 2 to see Andy be \\"little again\\" but after explaining to him that everyone grows up and it's ok, he soon wanted to watch it again and is now an absolute favorite!    I love it as well!!  It's a great adventure that teaches morals of what's nice and not so nice to do.  It's also great to see a movie where so many main characters (voices) stayed for the sequels!  It's definitely a family favorite!!
B00004XQ83|5.0|The movie, \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" has always been a favorite of mine and the music CD from the movie now brings back so many of those favorite parts of the film.  There are 18 songs on this CD ranging from a minute and a half to nearly 5 minutes.  I heartily recommend this CD to anyone who enjoyed the movie. The mix of Gospel, folk, and Bluegrass music makes this CD a \\"must have\\"
B0017H1MB6|5.0|This brachiosaurs is great.  Big and sturdy with excellent skin texture and paint job.  Highly recommend.  Teh four year old I bought it for, who is a miniature paleontologist, absolutely loved it despite already owning another plastic brachiosaur, as this one was way cooler.
160788657X|5.0|Downloaded the audio version directly from Amazon.com's subsidiary,  Audible.com.  Great listening as are all David Baldacci's books, especially the Oliver Stone (Camel Club Series).  Suggest those disgruntled price reviewers join Audible.com and get books as low as $9.62 for the Platinum Membership.  Nuff said!
031603438X|2.0|...Keith Richards has managed to make his life seem BORING.    First, the book is way too long, with too many uninteresting anecdotes about his childhood and his experiences with artists and models. Add to that an endless succession of drug busts, all delivered here without drama or pizzazz, and \\"Life\\" becomes positively tedious. I started skimming halfway through and STILL had trouble finishing the book. I would have thought the conflicts with Mick Jagger would add some spark but they fell flat too. Same with Altamont.    I'm usually a BIG fan of rock (auto)biographies but this one, surprisingly, left me cold. The various Guns n Roses/Axl Rose and Motley Crue bios were much more interesting, and the Ozzy bio was LOADS more fun than \\"Life.\\" Hell, even George W Bush's \\"Decision Points\\" has it all over Keith Richards' book. Wait for the paperback if you must read it.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|As usual, Michael Moore not only gets down to the bottom line, but digs deeper to the very core of the matter and, in this case, it isn't pretty. He questions everything we've ever been taught about capitalism and clearly points out how capitalism has run amok in this country. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the banks and big-business corporations are making tremendous profits off the backs of the tax-payers. There may be nothing we can do about it (yet), but at least Mr. Moore has made us aware of what's happened to our economy, who started our downhill slide, why they started it, and the convoluted political ploys that were used to accelerate it. I don't think anyone can view this DVD without quoting a beloved comic strip character, Charlie Brown -- \\"Good grief!\\"
1451539347|5.0|Persuasion is a fantastic novel by Jane Austen. I've read all of her works, and this is one of my absolute favorites. Even though it was written so long ago, the plot could be something that happened to someone today. Persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn't \\"acceptable\\" for the boy since she doesn't come from a wealthy family. They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story. There are actually a lot of similarities between this story and Jane's own story. Jane Austen is an incredible author, and Persuasion is one of her greatest works.  Comment
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I have recently retired from the medical field after 46+ years of working in hospitals and clinics. I saw first-hand the flaws in our present healthcare system, I knew of the profits made by the insurance companies, and I saw the horrific numbers of patients turned away because they didn't have health insurance. I have seen insured people left to suffer and die because their health insurance providers refused treatment on the basis that it was considered \\"experimental\\" or maybe the tests to get to the correct diagnosis were too expensive in the first place. What I didn't know was that other countries, including Cuba, provide better health care than we get in the good old U.S.A. And why didn't I know? Well, simply because everything we've heard about universal healthcare in other countries turns out to be scare tactics and lies. For instance, Canadians don't wait months for treatment or necessary surgery, the British provide preventive care along with medical care, French citizens not only get medical care but are provided with home care when needed, Cuba has state-of-the-art medical facilities -- and it's all free. This DVD is a real eye-opener, especially because it is not about the uninsured -- it's about those who have health insurance and still can't get the proper treatment. Michael Moore gets to the heart of the matter and points out, very succinctly, that the heart of the matter in this country is a stone-cold heart moved only by the profit motive. Universal healthcare? It's not such a frightening concept any more, at least to me. And if you watch this DVD, I'm pretty darn sure it will no longer be a frightening concept to you, either -- unless, of course, you work for an insurance company! If that's the case, you should be quaking in your boots!
1402714580|5.0|When I was in junior high, my mom made me read Little Women for one of my school assignments.  I thought I was going to hate it, but I ended up loving it.  In fact, I've read it multiple times since then.  The story shows the incredible bond between the sisters and the people around them.  It is honestly one of the books that will take you through a whole range of emotions.  The story is a delight to read, and Little Women will always be close to my heart.
B003TVMIDO|5.0|Excellent price.  Special Issue, it is a gift.  Remasterized, excellent sound.  Unpublished pieces and of very good quality.

0142428698|4.0|Being a retired Attorney this was so true to life. The manner i  which this was presented was excellent. Most descriptive.
0765326353|5.0|Original ideas and concepts in the fantasy realm are few and far between but this book has several. The characters, environments and story were awesomely crafted. It has been a long time since I've read a book and cursed myself for not being able to read faster.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Just ordered this DVD set yesterday, and it is already here with Free Super Savor Shipping!!!!  I am so excited for my daughter to open this on Christmas!  I bought the DVD so she can watch it in her room and we can still enjoy it on our Blue Ray player all together. Thanks Amazon for holding true to your fantastic standards!!
0316098337|4.0|I found Room to be intriguing, and at times quite riveting.  It is rare that I get so into a book that I read it in a day, so it was a gem to find a book where I did such that.  I found that using the point of view of the son was an excellent choice, putting a different fictional perspective on what is sadly based on very non-fictional crimes. The plot of the book was well thought out, and (not giving anything away) well divided in story.  The first half of this book alone was worthy of 5 stars, and makes this book a must read.<br /><br />Somehow though, something just seemed ever so slightly seemed off. The second half of the book almost seemed a little bit rushed and the thoughts and language of the second half of the book seemed a little bit sloppy.  Though the plot remained excellent in the second half of the story, it just didn't flow like the first half.  It left me just very slightly let down.<br /><br />That said, I really recommend this book.  It brings you in very quick, and it is hard to put down.  Just be forewarned that you may feel like it leaves you feeling a little disappointed and wishing the story felt a little more complete.
B002WCLG3Y|5.0|This is a pretty good movie, except its not set up like a movie. Its more like a bunch of chronicles.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|I was actually one of the few to root for the \\"Sky People\\". Now I know what you're thinking; Why whould I do that? Well, you must first understand the moral of the story and the message the director James Cameron(who called Glenn Beck the Antichrist, need I say more?) is trying to send to the world by making this movie.    The moral of the story is that determination (and overwhelming numbers) can defeat technology; that was the script for the climactic battle scene at the end, and the narrative taught to every enemy our nation has ever fought since 1975. Ask the  waves of surrendering Iraqi troops how well that worked for them in 1991. For the movie as a whole, if you take away all the Sci-Fi hocus pocus, you're left with a fanciful yet not entirely acurrate re-telling of the American-Indian wars and Vietnam, with the Americans playing their usual role as the oppressor. Add in a little radical environmentalist propaganda and you have a nice little bedtime story for George Soros to tell his grandkids. In my view, the only thing that makes the movie worth watching are the great special effects and the military action.    When Avatar first came out, some critics, many of which share Mr. Cameron's far-left views, went so far as to call it the greatest motion picture of all time. I would challenge that, but it is clear that the movie was a great cinematic achievement; but then again, so was Birth of A Nation and Triumph of The Will.
B0047SF41G|1.0|Cut to the chase - this movie stinks. The story is weak, none of the characters are developed, they're obscure and without depth. The lead, I mean the guy is not action flick leading man material - sorry. Nothing in the movie makes much sense from one scene to another. The most ridiculous thing is how they arrive on this planet, they parachute in, but there is no reason to use a parachute if you can be transported hundreds of light years, I'm sorry but it is just really stupid. Phrases such as \\"Why did they do that\\", What's that supposed to mean\\", and \\"That makes no sense\\" will come from you and whoever is watching it with you. Anyone who says this movie is good in the reviews must have an agenda, as in they stand to gain something by a positive review. In the end they left the door open for a sequel, they should have closed it. I rented it because I had a feeling it was going to be bad as are most new Sci-Fi movies. Don't look for the original \\"Predator\\" in this movie, he left and went home, don't look for \\"The day the Earth Stood Still\\" or \\"Forbidden Planet\\" in this movie, this director couldn't direct a taxicab around the block and the writers should go back to their cashiers job at McD's
B002VECLVO|4.0|\\"A Single Man\\" is set in Southern California during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It follows a day in the life of George Falconer (Colin Firth) an English professor, who is also a secretly gay man.  He is overwhelmed by the death of his partner of 16 years and in a deep depression.  There is no joy in life.  Every day he wakes up to \\"now\\", which is a day without his partner.  He is not in a position to grieve openly but grieves constantly inside.<br /><br />He quietly and carefully plans for his death at the end of the day.  The story is subdued, but a study of a man's grief and glimmers of hope.  The acting and direction are impressive, and the cinematography is absolutely high art.<br /><br />No matter what your background, Firth's performance makes a profound impression.<br /><br />It also has an outstanding supporting cast that includes Juliane Moore, Matthew Goode, and Nicholas Hoult.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|This is a good movie. It's well done in almost all respects. The only problem I have is the way Marion is portrayed, I think having her riding into battle with a drawn sword took something away from the character. Marion comes off as an overly strong woman which would not be fitting behavior for the wife of a Knight and land baron. Olivia de Havilland's  Marion is really the way Marion should be done. However this anomaly does not detract from the movie, the movie is simply great.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This thing is a beast and is worth every penny you will pay for it.  The kydex sheath hold the knife very securely.  You could mount this upside down to a backpack strap without even using the security snap, and the knife will not come out unless you give a NICE tug on it.    As others have mentioned, the knife is 1/4 inch thick and is a \\"brick house.\\"  The handle is very comfortable, but for some strange reason if you do not like it, you can remove it and wrap the tang with paracord for a cool look and smaller grip.    For the money - this is a heck of a deal for a USA made KA-BAR!  If you order this, I'm pretty sure the first word out of your mouth when you open the box will be \\"WOW.\\"
1439153663|1.0|I was so excited to read this book after I read the reviews.  I must admit I quickly understood who each character was and wanted to know more about them all but I just don't understand how this book can be entertaining.  It is a very tragic story and after reading about 60 pages I have read about countless deaths and a child being hurt over and over.  I just don't see this as entertainment reading and I do not recommend this book.  This author is a fabulous story teller and the story was very easy to read but I just couldnt' get past how each page just gets more and more tragic.  No thanks.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|As a long time Satch fan I found his last few albums a little underwhelming.  This album lacks the hooks and catchy toons but there's just something about it.  Mike Keneally and the band as a whole are playing some very tasty stuff.  Jeff's drums are perfect.  The songs don't feel labored or contrived.  This is quite possibly Joe's best overall album - it's awesome from start to finish.  Listening to it just makes you feel good.  I liked it as a whole on first listen and love it more and more as I listen to it thru repeatedly.  I haven't heard a ton of Mike Keneally - mostly pyrotechnical stuff from Vai or Zappa's Universe - and his playing on this album is just awesome in restraint and tastefulness - it blends with Joe's songs and playing perfectly.    One thing that often gets tiresome with guitar instrumentals is the whole verse/chorus/verse/chorus thing where it's like a bad pop song in structure and the main riffs are repeated too much, too contrived and drawn out.  It often feels like an obvious catchy phrase and setup for a solo.  This is especially true for some of Joe's songs which, while catchy and very good as songs, can sometimes get old with the repetition.    You have to figure that most people who listen to this stuff are musicians who can handle a bit more than pop song structures.  :P    One thing I like about this album and Paul Gilbert's new album (his best instrumental album, IMO) is that the songs feel much more natural and flowing.  The repetitive parts of songs aren't beaten to death as they often have been in the past.  The songs feel less like setups for killer solos, even thought the killer solos and sexy playing are still there.
B0041OOJNU|5.0|I think this is a great production. What a combination of rhythms! Just amazing. For listening, you have sale el sol, antes de las seis, lo que mas, mariposas, devocion. For dancing, simply the rest! It is ABSOLUTELY worth buying! You do not have to be a fan to recognize it.
B003A4IFGY|4.0|Frankly, it took me a while to get into \\"Mojo.\\" It's not because it's not good--the playing, as usual, is superb, and the vibe is easy and natural--but probably because the songs don't have the immediate hooks that most Heartbreakers (and solo Petty) albums have. Nothing sticks immediately in my mind. The HB's last album, \\"The Last DJ,\\" had plenty of catchy hooks, but \\"Mojo\\" doesn't. I think it's more of a \\"groove\\" album than anything Petty and the HBs have ever cut. It's definitely a grower for me. It gets better with repeated listens, but, again, no song sticks in my mind. That's why I give it four stars instead of five. But, as I said, it's immaculately put together, everyone plays really well, the songwriting and lyrics are top-notch, and the production is as good as I've ever heard out of a Petty album. (I just ordered the Blu-Ray, so I have high expectations for that.) Overall, \\"Mojo\\" is another solid effort from IMO the most consistently excellent band in rock history. The album may fall a notch below Petty's best, but it's still worthy of note in his incredibly rich catalog.
B004132HZS|5.0|All the superlatives about this series have already been stated.  My main gripe is that I pre-ordered this item 6 weeks ago with the release date stated as November 9, 2010.  Come that date, Amazon.com states it'll be an additional 1 to 4 weeks before the DVD ships!  What is going on here?  This is really inexcusable.  Was this item released on November 9th or not?  And if not, shouldn't those of us who pre-ordered it be notified of the additional delay and why?
B0036G4CZO|5.0|After waiting for numerous ship dates (all of which passed) for this item, Amazon told me that my order must be canceled because they could no longer supply this item to buyers. So I had to purchase this item from a company in Japan for a much higher price.  It is a fine item though. It does contain the photo book that was included in the US version of this album, back in 1973, all reduced in size, and the gatefold artwork is from the UK version. The sound is wonderful also, but it is on TWO CDs, not one like the BMG version. I had to purchase this one since I already had LIVE DATES TWO,(finally available after all these years), both of them make a matched set.
0385473788|4.0|The book is WONDERFUL and so was the service.  It was advertised as \\"hardcover\\" and because a softcover version was delivered, I received the book for free and only paid for the postage and delivery.  I would definately purchase from this person again.<br /><br />Stewart
B00005JM02|5.0|My 2 year old loves this movie and since it brings two disc i have one in her room and the other at grandmas house. Great movie!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|While the screenplay had to be adapted to fit the time constraints of a feature movie, the screenplay preserves the Austen dialog in most major scenes. The acting is superb and very believable; it gives more depth to the characters. Jane Austen, herself, critiqued \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" after it was published, by saying it lacked shadows or depth. Director Joe Wright did a fantastic job at creating those moments between Elizabeth and Darcy, so the movie takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride that is very believable. Brenda Blythe and Donald Sutherland do outstanding jobs in their roles as Elizabeth's parents. One last thing: the music is out of this world. It's far superior to any previous adaptations.
0500515328|3.0|This is a lovely book to look at and the author has unearthed some very rare photos you only normally see in low quality on the internet along with pieces sold long ago at obscure auctions for our viewing pleasure.  Having said that I found this book somewhat disappointing.  Given the topic there's some unavoidable cross over with the contents of [[ASIN:086565171X Jewels of the Tsars: The Romanovs and Imperial Russia]], which is another visual treat. The author has also matched up photos of people wearing their jewels to sold pieces that is very interesting and lacking in \\"Jewels of the Tsars\\" on a scale such as this.      What it is missing though is a full list of the jewels sold in 1927 and those taken into exile with the imperial family.  To get the 1927 list you have to get [[ASIN:B00283LZA6 A History of the Crown Jewels of Europe]] which is both rare and expensive or for the jewels in exile [[ASIN:0471727970 The Fate of the Romanovs]]where the list is available as an appendix. The lack of this hard, useful information for those researching Russian imperial jewels will make this book of mostly visual use in the future rather than the last word on the subject.  One other glaring omission in both of these books is a lack of photos of the jeweled badges the ladies in waiting wore for each empress. These are distinctly Russian pieces of jewellery, and while odd examples are shown neither book goes into them in any detail which is a great pity.    The text is 90% recounting of the biographies of various members of the imperial family and friends lives.  I suspect a full family tree would be useful for those not familiar with the Romanovs. The majority of the information about the jewels themselves is to be found in the captions for the pictures and for me that made this a somewhat odd book, but one which nevertheless will have it's place on my bookshelf.
B000UX6OHK|1.0|This watch is highly over priced.  It looks too cheap to even carry a $40 price tag.  I am seriously disappointed with my purchase.  Since I threw away the box I can't return it!  Don't buy this if you want something that looks very nice.  I would say at $20-$25 it would be appropriate for a teenager or as a casual watch (possibly.)    I'm not sure why the others put such a high rating on this watch, unless they purchased it MUCH cheaper!
B0038M2RL2|3.0|It's not as good as the first one but it also not that bad. Even though it had it sappy moments it continued the story and it wasn't a cheap remake of the first one like part 3. Overall,rent it not buy it. I give this disc a 6 out of 10.
B003YOMNCM|5.0|Excellent recording by an outstanding young talent.  Great to give as a gift or for your own collection. The Higdon selection is one that hasn't been heard previously, so far as I know.  It is well worth having and listening to again and again.  Hahn is outstanding and I am anxious to have more of her recordings.
B003KVNV4S|5.0|Wow is all I can say about this album. I never really heard any of their previous work before, and if their work before is anything like this then I'm buying all their albums. I love the whole cd but my favorite track is Vanderlyle Crybaby Greeks.
B003VANOFY|3.0|i was really hoping for actual surround when i purchased the headphones, instead of simulated, however the sound is still quite convincing. just not enough for gaming as in knowing a person is either walking infront or behind you.    the headphones are really durable, and if you somehow run low on battery which is very unlikely, it plugs in from the left headphone instead of the right one. not the best for long gaming sessions because the metal the headphones are made out of is so strong that it squeezes your head very tightly. like off your head there is 1 inch between each speaker. i dont know of any heads that are 1 inch wide, kinda silly. it makes my head pulse like if u tied a rope around your arm tightly.    and the worst gripe is they have a feature called sidetone, which is designed to hear your own voice inside the speakers so that you dont get the \\"blocked ears affect\\" which is a great idea.... however when you use this feature you find out that the microphone is not earthed correctly and hear a slight buzzing noise in your headphones. THIS IS A MAJOR FAULT!! could be easily avoided with a simple patch to mute if not talking like most voice activated controllers like on teamspeak.    overall i give it 3 out of 5. about time there was some surround sound cordless headphones, but the testing department needs the sack, if there was one.
1400032717|5.0|well written, a fascinating story that is good reading from the first word to the last.  The protagonist is autistic.  As the story progresses the author described his autistic young man's  thinking process so well that you begin to see the world from his view point.  A must for anyone working or related to someone with autism...a must for anyone who isn't.  A book I would read again.

0596527055|4.0|This book is more than what the title eludes.  It's not just about dissecting the meaning of \\"innovation\\", or busting myths.  It's about thought processes, human nature, intentional and accidental evolution of problem solving, and misperceptions about how great things materialize from hard work and difficult choices.<br /><br />Maybe I'm abnormal, well, actually, yes I am.  But I really like the way this book builds from start to finish.  It leads you through a logical formation of understanding of how the mind works to form ideas.  Not only that, but how subsequent actions reinforce ideas as a catalyst for accelerating them to optimum form: Epiphany.<br /><br />But more than this, it breaks down the popular belief that epiphanies just happen out of thin air, or only from unseen out-of-body forces, when actually, they almost always fall into place from many hours of work and thinking.  The author likens it to the final piece of a puzzle falling into place, but not that the final piece is any more important than any other piece.  It simply marks the conclusion of the previous work leading up to the breakthrough.  In breaking down some of the myths surrounding some renown discoveries, inventions, and breakthroughs, he attempts to show where the real process forms and evolves to the point where great things happen.[[ASIN:1449389627 The Myths of Innovation]]
B0018PH3L0|5.0|There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said many times before about Lonesome Dove.  It is so good that no one would even make a western for years after its release...because they knew their work would be compared to Lonesome Dove.  There is something about the story, the combination of award-winning actors, the tempo, and the realism that has not been matched before or since.  It is a story that will never grow old in the telling because the issues are timeless.  Friendship, self-sacrifice, courage, and the bonding of men make for an enduring combination.
0307266303|5.0|I read this book quite a long time ago after seeing 25 reviews on Amazon, all of which gave it a 5 star rating. After re-reading it recently I figured I should add my 5 star review to the now much expanded list.<br /><br />This book starts out very strangely alternating chapters between an account of a crazy barefoot race in Mexico with a narrator discussing the virtues of running and how it has affected him personally. Soon enough the two subplots intertwine and you learn about how the narrator actually joins this crazy barefoot race. The book is surprisingly powerful and really illustrates the power of the human body that is apparently capable of running hundreds of miles barefoot over rough terrain. There are many parts of the book that you can apply to your own life if you are a runner and that get you thinking about exactly what value your running shoes are providing you and exactly how hard are you really pushing your body when you get off the treadmill panting. This is a must read for any runners out there and once you get past the first few chapters you will not be disappointed.
B00447G2T8|5.0|This an amazing album from these veteran metallers.  Everything about the album is worthy of the highest ranking.  First, the production is over the top. Excellent tone and sound quality throughout.  Second, the drums and base are in perfect sync.  The seamless speed and interaction is incredible.  Third, the twin guitars are likewise in harmony and display brilliance at every level.  Fourth, with two exceptions, the speed and power of the songs on this album are unforgiving and without equal.     This album is definitely not to be missed by any fans of the group itself, power/metal in general, or German metal.

0307460444|4.0|Being a huge Martha Stewart AND cupcake fan, I definitely had to get this book. Yes, you can get lots of the recipes online, but it's definitely not the same as having all of them set before you in this beautiful book.<br /><br />Even if you have no idea what kind of cupcake you want to make, just leaf through the book to get tons and tons of wonderful ideas. And then you'll need to make them all!<br /><br />The recipes aren't all perfect, but with some small simple adjustments, you can make them so. Plus, they're so so pretty and creative, you can't complain! In love!
B00005JPLW|4.0|The story of the Spartans standing off the greatest army of the ancient world at Thermopylae is awesome- and this film does it justice, with great action sequences, unbelievable graphical imaging, and dialogue that definitely holds your interest- you want to be a man, take some Spartan lessons!!!
B003EV6DBW|4.0|I'll admit I was a bit skeptical when I started watching the first two episodes of the fifth series for \\"Doctor Who\\". While Matt Smith is fine as the Doctor and brings his own quirky interpretation to the role, the writing for the first two episodes was, to be charitable, weak (in fact the second episode borrowed an idea from the pilot episode of \\"Star Trek: The next Generation\\" although to be fair \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" \\"borrowed\\" the idea of the Borg so turn about seems to be fair play here.). I was surprised as writer Steven Moffatt had written the best episodes of the previous seasons in my opinion. Luckily, things picked up by the third episode set in World War Two where PM Winston Churchill unveils his own secret weapon to take out the Nazi's with unintended consquences and results.<br /><br />The transfer here looks better than any of the previous episodes on either DVD or Blu-ray. The first four series were shot on regular video and blacks looked more like very dark blues. The colors are quite good here. The fifth season looks quite nice in its high def premiere. If you've purchased the DVD I can't comment on the video quality as I haven't seen it.<br /><br />A couple of minor complaints--the two part episode involving the Weeping Angels are NOT on the same disc (and should be)and while audio is an improvement over some of the previous sets, dialogue is occasionally overwhelmed by the music IF you choose to listen to the 5.1 mix in stereo (the obvious solution would be to listen to it in 5.1 but some folks won't do that hence the warning).<br /><br />The extras are, as always, quite generous. \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", \\"Victory of the Daleks\\", \\"The Time of Angels\\", \\"The Vampires of Venice\\", \\"Cold Blood\\" and \\"The Big Bang\\" all feature pip commentary tracks. We get deleted scenes, outtakes, \\"Doctor Who Confidential\\", video diaries and \\"Monster Files\\" for various creatures. There are three collectable postcards included in the set as well. The booklet that was in previous editions has been eliminated replaced by credits on the cardboard fold out cover. I dislike this packaging compared to the previous ones but it isn't horrible. The cover is a lenticular image of Smith and his lovely co-star Karen Gilan who plays the Doctor's new companion Amy Pond.<br /><br />\\"Doctor Who: The Complete Fifth Series\\" is a bit inconsistent but the best episodes here more than hold their own with the best of previous seasons.s has been eliminated replaced by credits on the cardboard fold out cover.

0399536108|5.0|I really enjoyed this book becuase it has a simple format that is honest and to the point. It is not full of fluff and references to how great the author is. It is real information that can be assimilated and acted upon. I didn't need another book to tell me how to live my life and I friend who I envy a little recommended this one. I am traveling the world more, although not as much as my friend, but I have a diferent perspective on why. The best three books to read when choosing a path in life are: The Art of Non-Conformity, The Four Hour Work Week and Vagabonding. That is if you want to be who you are, where you are, and that would be of your choosing. Life is life, until you actually step on the court and start to play and then it is amazing. Chris's book helps you to see that.<br />I recommend you by the book. It is available on Kindle as well.<br />John
B0034G4OY0|4.0|Eastwood the Director may wind up in history more well-known than Eastwood the Actor, and for the man who played Dirty Harry and The Man With No Name, in addition to brilliant starring roles in his own films such as Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby - that is saying something.<br /><br />Hereafter is a film with three different plots headed toward a common destination.  In one strand Cecile De France plays Marie, a Parisian Journalist who is saved from drowning in a tsunami and finds that she can't extricate her private and professional lives from the experience.  Frankie and George McLaren play twin brothers Marcus and Jason.  The brothers have a drug-addicted single mother and share the task of shielding her and themselves from the authorities before tragedy strikes.  In the final thread Matt Damon plays George Lonegan, the character you know the other characters are moving toward.<br /><br />George has the ability to talk to the dead through contact with people who have connections to the deceased.  He explains halfway through the film that he developed this ability after a near-death experience, and although his brother (played by Jay Mohr) thinks \\"the gift\\" is a gold-mine that should be exploited, George tries explaining repeatedly that it is a curse rather than a blessing.  (Any person George touches floods him with images of the dearly departed.)<br /><br />The film moves slowly.  After the opening Marie doesn't want to be a journalist so much as explore the world of near-death experiences.  We see young Marcus visiting sham psychics.  In a series of scenes we see Damon's George reluctantly give \\"readings\\".  One of the strengths of the film is that it contrasts the work of the fake psychics, who use clues obtained reading body language and facial expressions, with the dilemma of a person like George, who can't turn his power off, which invariably makes it impossible for him to develop actual relationships. How can you be \\"normal\\" if every time you touch a fellow human - you see dead people? Bryce Dallas Howard plays a pleasant woman George meets in cooking class.  George attempts to hide his psychic ability from her, but when she finds out, she pressures him into a reading.  What begins looking like a simple parlor trick instead rips open decades-old wounds.<br /><br />For action addicts the film moves glacially after the tsunami scene, but the emotional payoff at the end is worth the trip.ead people?

B0043ISH6O|5.0|For a commercial CD, probably commissioned for the movie, I was very impressed with how artistic and techno influenced these songs were.  Track #2 \\"In Motion\\" stands out as my favorite and reminds me of Orbital.  If you like vocals you may be disappointed as there aren't any on any of the tracks.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I couldn't help but compare \\"RED\\" to the Coen Brothers' \\"Burn After Reading\\".  Both are comedies centered around preposterous CIA plots, and both feature John Malkovich.  For \\"Retired, Extremely Dangerous\\" I only lament that the script spent more time setting up a ridiculous plot than giving its' A-List cast dialogue worthy of 3 Oscars (Morgan Freeman,Helen Mirren and Richard Dreyfuss) and 2 Emmies (Brian Cox and Malkovich).  Mary-Louise Parker gives one of the best performances in the film as a government clerk who gets dragged into the life and death spy game only because Bruce Willis' retired character takes a shine to her.  Karl Urban gets the thankless role as the CIA henchman leading the black ops team trying to exterminate Willis and company.<br /><br />The plot is entirely too ridiculous to be taken seriously, but the film is also a little flat taken strictly as a comedy.  I'll split it down the middle and say it's worth watching if it comes up while you're on a plane, or a rental on a \\"we're bored\\" night, if only to watch these excellent actors look like they're having a quite good time.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Toy Story 3 could have not been anymore perfect. I cried about 4 times throughout the whole movie. It creates a wonderful story for people new to the film and those have seen them all.     I have a plan, that I believe I saw somewhere that I won't let me kids watch Toy Story 3 until they're about to graduate high school. I grew up with this movie and I will love it just as much as I love the other Toy Story/PIXAR films.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS  this is one of my favorite books. it is well written and descriptive in my opinion. it never gets boring. i am so obsessed with this book that i could asnwer any question about it.       in my opinion the minor characters play a huge part in the book. if one were to think about any of the many many many minor characters roles they would realize if one of them didnt exist then it would throw the rest of the story off. here are only very few examples of this.   if Glimmer did not exist then Katniss would have never got the bow and arrows when the Careers chased her up a tree where she dropped a tracker jacker nest on them killing Glimmer. if Marvel (boy from District 1) didnt exsist Rue wouldnt have died how she did. if Cato didnt exist then katniss and peeta couldve won easier. but then who would the mutts have attacked? if Clove wasnt there who would Thresh have killed at the feast? Katniss? then whats the point of the book if the main character dies in the middle of the story? then theres Foxface. if she didnt exist then Katniss wouldve never known about the mines around the Careers supplies. once again Katniss would have died. Rue. my favorte character. Katniss wouldnt have known how to treat tracker jacker stings and she wouldnt know how to use the night vision glasses. If Thresh didnt exsist Katniss would be dead. simply because Thresh saved her from Clove at the feast. Prim... if she didnt exsit Katniss wouldnt have gone to the Hunger Games in the first place. no story there. if Gale didnt exist Katniss wouldnt have known how to set up the snares that she did. Finally, Cinna created what Katniss and Peeta wore when they rode in the chariots throught the capitol. because of their costumes Katniss became known as the girl on fire.    the point of that long paragraph was to say that Suzanne Collins made all of the minor characters play a very important role in some part of the book.    the one thing i dont like about this book is Peeta. its hardto explain without ruining the last book but i absolutely despise him. in my opinion he just made it harder on Katniss in the arena. i also think that Gale shouldve voulenteered to take Peetas place.     once again this is my favorite book and i cannot wait until the movie comes out! when i wrote this i found that it is supposed to come out in 2013.

0805091742|5.0|In THE CHECKLIST MANIFESTO, Atul Gawande explores error through examples from aviation, construction, finance, healthcare, restaurants and rock `n roll. He writes that while errors of ignorance decreased as society gained knowledge, errors of ineptitude have increased in the overload, distraction and isolation of modern specialization. His solution: checklists -- the to-do type, not the how-to type -- to improve individual performance and seed the communication that enhances team (system) effectiveness.    It's a simple solution technically but complicated socially, for example Gawande's reaction to the adoption of a checklist in his own surgical practice:    Before: \\"Did I think the checklist would make much of a difference in my cases? No. In *my* cases? Please.\\"  After: \\"I have yet to get through a week in surgery without the checklist's leading us to catch something we would have missed.\\"    And regarding team communication, he writes:    \\"We're obsessed in medicine with having great components -- the best drugs, the best devices, the best specialists -- but pay little attention to how to make them fit together well. [...] Optimizing parts is not a good route to system excellence. [It's like] trying to build the world's greatest car by assembling the world's greatest car parts.\\"    A quick, absorbing read directed toward administrators, policymakers, standards-setters, professionals and the interested public, the book's information is not necessarily new but it is ground-shifting. The Case Record in today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine could have been a chapter.

B003PIUBZS|4.0|If you like the TV show, Rome and the movie, 300, then you'll love this.  If you hate graphic sex and violence, you should avoid this.  It's about one of the most famous rebels in world history.  The first episode is great.  You get a real feel of how brutal life was in the Roman army.  You also get to see how brutal Rome was to its so called allies.  The show then falls flat a bit after the first episode.  Much of the story line is replaced by gore,sex and other Roman excesses. The fight scenes are really sickening and not for the faint hearted.  The episode, In the Pits, personifies this.  Towards the end of the season the story picks up again.  Spartacus begins to see the terrible injustices in the Roman world.  He learns this lesson in a very painful and personal way.  Finally, Spartacus and the other gladiators rebel.  To say any more would probably give the ending away (even though we know how the Spatacus' revolt ends).  There is so much we don't know about Spartacus but names from Roman history at the time are used.  We see Crixus.  He was Spatacus' second in command.  Glaba, a Roman general, who tries to quash the revolt is an important character in the show.  The producers have done quite well in trying to fix up the gaps.  Andy Whitfield does a great job playing Spartacus.  The supporting cast also a pretty good job.  Though John Hannah doesn't quite get it right as the bad guy.  Despite the problems I have mentioned, Spartacus is well worth a look.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I typically don't write reviews on blu-rays I've bought... the films speak for themselves and there are so many good reviews. But I have to voice my opinion on this package.    My coworker was into the Scott Pilgrim graphic comics years before the movie was released. At that time, I read a few pages but never bothered to read through the first volume.     After seeing the first trailer, I was interested. After seeing the film, I was really entertained. I had a good time with this movie. Some critics said that anyone over 30 won't get it. I'm young at heart, 32 and this is one of the best pieces of entertainment I've seen this year. I know when I'm watching something intellectual, artistic, brains-off or just fun.     Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is fun, faithful to the 6 volume graphic comic series by Bryan Lee O'Malley (for the most part) and fresh.    Picture and audio quality on the blu ray are fantastic. Experience \\"The Winstead Effect\\" in HD. Yeah....    There are a LOT of extras that are all worthwhile. Four commentaries, a Trivia Track I've yet to activate while watching the film again and so much more.     While the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" and \\"Making of\\" are in HD, most other extras are in Standard Def. Not a major downer because the content itself is awesome for each extra.     I won't list them all out, but some of them that stuck out for me were:    ****** SPOILER ALERT ******     ----- Alternate Edits -----  While there are the excellent \\"Deleted Scenes\\" included (the Alternate Ending is still neat), this \\"Alternate Edits\\" is also interesting. For example, in the final fight with Gideon, there's an alternate take which Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) says the \\"..with your advanced American technology..\\" line from the comic! I can see why they didn't include this in the theatrical edit, but I thought it was awesome that they had it thrown into the Alt Edits section.    ----- \\"Comic to Film\\" Comparison (Photo Gallery) -----  Here you can see a side by side of comic panes vs a still from the film.     Lots of respect to Edgar Wright and the visual effects team - they literally took impact graphics (\\"KPOW!\\" \\"SMASH\\") from the comic *down to the very font* and placed them in the film. The amount of fidelity to the source material is very respectable.     ----- Fake Posters (Photo Gallery -----  All of Lucas Lee's fake movie posters crack me up. In addition they have promo posters for Clash at Demonhead, the poster for the Katayanagi Twins vs Sex Bob-omb Battle of the Bands, etc.    ----- Hair & Make Up Montage -----  This is really simple but fantastic to observe. Each character stands in front of the camera in their proper outfits. It's simple but it's like person-watching and an extra 'bonus look' into the mannerisms of each character in the film. Not every character is in this segment, but most of the key ones are.    ----- Music Videos ----  This includes the Envy Adams (Brie Larson) version of \\"Black Sheep\\" originally by Metric. I wish these music videos were in HD, but it'll have to do.    ----- Phantom Slo Mo Montage ----  Shows fighting moves and acrobatic performances by the cast against the original blue screens. Here you can see that, among other awesome moves by the rest of the cast, Mary Elizabeth Winstead actually does her own high kick.    ----- Trivia Track ----  Very informative text/subtitle track that pops up info at the center/bottom portion of the screen throughout the movie. Learn what songs are being played when in addition to tons of other bits (what video game sounds are referenced, locations of actual places, etc).    Having seen the film in theaters and reading the entire series after (they are actually very short reads and very cool), I have even more respect for Edgar Wright... despite Hollywood conventions and pressure, he stayed relatively close to the comic books. Faithful to the source material as best he could.  Volume 6 hadn't been completed when this film was finished, and I can see why they would change things up a little. (Example: in the comic, Roxy's fight was more sword-based and her 'weakness' in the film is actually Envy Adam's weakness... and Gideon's fight was very different - even the blu ray extras show the proposed \\"Mecha-Gideon\\" battle that may have showed up in the film).    A fun, entertaining film and a really good blu-ray with lots of extras you really shouldn't miss. 64x hit combo and five stars.
B003K16P3M|4.0|i love just the concept of this book. ive always wished i had 2 different colored eyes for some reason and now i want them more! i have to say, if i had a Grace, id be Graced with speed. i dont do anything slow and slowness irks me. this is one of my favorite books!
B003ZJJHWK|5.0|I don't usually write too many reviews on here, but I felt I had to respond to the poor overall rating this album seems to have received on here.  This album is much too good for that.  While I may have overrated it compensation (It's probably more of a 4.25-4.5, this stands up very favorably against The Crying Light and I Am A Bird Now.  Antony is a master of evocative and complex melodies and hauntingly gorgeous atmosphere and that has not changed on Swanlights (a title which I absolutely love).      A brief word on Antony's EPs - why does he release them?  Another World and Thank You For Your Love were both extremely weak and give very little hope for the coming album.  And, as with The Crying Light where \\"Another World\\" was the one skippable track, so too here \\"Thank You For Your Love\\" is the skippable one.  It starts off decently, if not spectacularly, but the ending repetitively shouted cacophony is extremely grating.      However, the rest of the album is wonderful from start to finish.  \\"Salt Silver Oxygen\\" is almost classical in its complexity, \\"Fletta\\" has truly transcendent moments (sadly hampered by a few moments which destroy the unity and mood of the track), and \\"Salt Silver Oxygen\\" is beautiful as well.  The two truly wonderful tracks, however, are \\"Ghost\\" and \\"Swanlights\\", both of which I could listen to over and over.      For fans of Antony, this album comes highly recommended, but keep an open mind, and beware the curse of the EP!
B002N5N5R0|5.0|I am sooo addicted to this show. Luckily, I started watching recently so I could watch the first and second continuosly. Now I watch the 3rd season here online on video on demand and its always in my online library if I wanna watch it again.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The Walking Dead has brought the zombie genre back from the dead, after several years as a popular comic series, The Walking Dead has made it to cable television in this outstanding series. It is unlike any other cable show out there. You will believe yourself to be watching a graphic horror movie as this no holds barred horror series cut no corners nor did it do much to censor the brutality required in zombie media.<br /><br />Highly recommend this to any zombie fan out there, it is much better than youd think it would be, considering it is aired on AMC.<br /><br />M Joseph Schuhler Jr<br />Author of the Plague Apocalypse series<br />[...].
B00164GDD2|2.0|Great movie, lousy picture.  The picture quality was so grainy that I couldn't tell the difference between this and a DVD version of the movie.  1080p should mean something.  Oh well, not the end of the world.  Classic '80s movie...never gets old.
B0000DEQXD|5.0|(Note: This is a repeat of my review of the original, cheaper Opera d'Oro release, which has no libretto.)<br /><br />This same live performance from Dec. 7, 1976, has been around on varoius labels (Myto, Melodram) but here is at bargain price from Opera d'Oro. All the companies use the same radio broadcast, in good stereo, from La Scala, with differences in remastering. In this case the sound stage is a bit cramped because someobdy has rolled off the treble, but in other versions the treble is irritatingly bright, so this is a good compromise.<br /><br />Carlos Kleiber conducted only a handful of operas, and Otello was one of his most acclaimed. It was heard only a few times at the Met becasue the conductor walked out on the production soon after the premiere. He made no commercial recordings, so this one, plus some other pirated recordings on other occasions, is all we will ever have (unless DG is hiding something in its vaults). I have heard three Kleiber Otellos and consider this the best, thanks to Domingo's youthful, impassioned singing--probably his best ever in this role--and Freni's incomparable Desdemona, which can also be heard on another Otello from Opera d'Oro with Jon Vickers under Karajan. It too is excellent in every way.<br /><br />Kleiber took a swift, tense, tightly controlled approach to the score. He did wonders with the La Scala orchestra and chorus, who sound disciplined yet highly committed. This is a very Italian night at the opera and includes a loud argument in the audience at one point! The sound gets congested during climaxes, but on the whole this is one of the better pirated recordings on the market, not up to studio quality but highly listenable anyway. As a performance it stands among the very best on disc.<br />Why no voting buttons? We don't let customer
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS  how can this possibly be the end to The Hunger Games, my favorite book!? i agree with what eveyone else says about the characters the plot and the storyline but what about the actual events in the story?     id like to start by saying i hate Peeta. now u can probably understand why i hate the ending. why did she choose Peeta over Gale? its frustrating because Suzanne Collins never says why. Sudennly, Gale has a job in District 2 and she just goes back to 12 and marries Peeta!? what the heck!? in my opinion, Gale shouldve voulenteered to take Peetas place in the 74th Hunger Games in the first book. then Peeta would have no part whatsoever in the book.     next, why did so many people die!? if anyone can explain Suzanne Collins reasons for the following deaths please tell me! Cinna. i think that it was totally pointless because he hardly did anything except design a few things for the whole Mockingjay thing. why didnt they kill Peeta when he was prisoner at the capitol? Portia and Peetas prep team. i have one question. anyone feel free to correct me if im wrong. what the h e double hockeysticks did they do!? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! THATS WHAT! it really angers me when a character dies for no reason. why did Finnick die? was the auther bored with the action she already had going on so she just decides to kill someone to make it interesting? his death was so quick and Katniss didnt even think about it at all so i was confused if she cared or not. i was upset for 2 reasons. first he didnt have a reason to die. second she spent so little time on it that it made it seem pointless and almost worthless. the one that ticks me off the most is Prim. if anyone in the book deserved to die Prim would be the last one id choose. Katniss was acting too numb and Prims death also came across as rushed and almost uncared for by the author.     to conclude my phsycotic rant, i would like to add a few comments:  1 this book was dissapointing  2 i hate Peeta  3 im on Team Gale  4 i really hate Peeta  5 i dont like being on a losing Team  6 i REALLY hate Peeta.   7 honestly throughout all 3 books i was hoping Peeta would die.  8 i hated the book especially the ending  9 is this even the same series as the Hunger Games!?  10 did i mention i hate Peeta?    thanks for reading my whole phsycotic rant if you got this far!      congratz! youve officially read a phsycotic rant!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Toy Story Saga has to be one of the best produced by Disney/Pixar. Each Toy Story brings about a unique story that the whole family can enjoy. Toy Story 3 is nothing short of amazing. The graphics utilized continue to be some of the best in the marketplace. The story itself is touching, exciting and presents new exciting characters to the Toy Story saga.<br /><br />This is honestly a must have.
B002VPE1Z2|3.0|&lt;Update - the velcro is a bad idea.  It has come apart and fallen off my belt several times now, so I have stapled it together.  I had to use a heavy duty stapler><br /><br />&lt;Update - after just 2 months of daily use, it has started coming apart at the seams in two different places.  Each separation is now about 2 inches long. - However Amazon sent a replacement and all is forgiven. Yes, I chose a replacement instead of a refund because it really is the perfect size and layout for me.  The velcroed belt loop has never hinted at coming undone.  The zipppered pocket keeps my loose change and bullet pen in place quite nicely.><br /><br />This is just small enough that I am not self conscious about having it on my belt every day, but large enough to function as both my phone holster and wallet.  Any larger or smaller and one of those two above functions would have overly suffered.<br /><br />I was concerned before I purchased it that the velcro belt loop would not be secure enough, but that has proven unfounded and it is nice to be able to quickly remove the case without having to undo my belt.<br /><br />That front zippered pocket is larger than I anticipated and works perfectly as a replacement for my small front wallet with my workplace proximity card in front.<br /><br />The main compartment holds my Tilt2 and a plastic multi-card-holder that has all my non-every-day cards.<br /><br />I am very thankful for Amazon's generous return policy as it took 4 trials of various phone holsters and 3 returns to settle on this case.<br /><br />With 3 thick proximity cards, various ID cards, store discount cards, credit cards, transit cards, etc., my wallet was getting too thick to carry everything around, so before now, I split the stuff up into a thin front wallet and kept the rest at home.  The only problem was that those other cards were never handy when I did want one of them.<br /><br />The solution was to stop carrying a wallet and just put everything into a larger phone case.  A very nice solution (4 months now and I still agree).
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Simply one of the best movies ever released.  If you are part of the \\"Nintendo\\" generation or just a lazy kid at heart, you will love this movie.<br /><br />Also, the Blu-ray is incredible.  I would imagine they crammed each disc to the brim just to fit everything in there.
B0034G4OWM|5.0|I rent this movie from Red box and ordered the movie from Amazon immediately after watching it with the family.  Don't understand why there are many negative comments here about this great family movie.  I love comedy movie and this movie was unexpectedly great.  I could not remember when was my last time to laugh so much with tears from watching a movie.  Our whole family enjoyed it so much, especially our two little girls (age 4 and 6).  I plan to get 3 more DVDs as the Christmas presents for the family members.  I highly recommend this great movie.
B002QEISMA|3.0|But I found this album less easily accessible than the band's previous three albums. And it definitely doesn't match the clarity of \\"Second Life Syndrome\\". \\"SLS\\" flows through you like oxigen, this one doesn't. It kinda felt too busy, got me tired of it quickly. Hope they will be more relaxed when recording their next album. It is still a good album, though. And I love this band.
630157401X|5.0|I wonder how many of you actually made it to this page from Jon Lajoie's website. I love this movie so when I saw the link I had to click to see if it actually took me to the movie. Which it did.
0679805273|5.0|This is exactly the type of messaging that we are weeding out of our kids education.  Look, you are gonna do great things...except when you don't.  It's okay though because you'll pick yourself up and try again.  Not being really exposed to kids until I had my first about 15 months ago I didn't realize how cool some of these Seuss books are.  This has to be one of my favorites and also one of the last books of his I've purchased.  Sure there are better books for learning to read, but for adults who can't stand one syllable rhyming while their kids are just trying to take it all in anyway, pick this up along with \\"Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?\\" and read them now.
0060987464|1.0|I have purchased a second hand book from the seller. But the condition was pretty bad. I even had a half torn front cover for the book. From this incident, i had doubts on my next purchase for any used books.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|After having purchased this box set, I will never listen to the stereo versions of these albums again. The  Mono versions just sound so much fuller and in most instances like they were recorded just yesterday. Mores the pity that we don't get to hear more 60's classics as they were meant to be heard in glorious Mono.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|This is an amazing piece of work. The 3D is incredible, the shots are so great it looks at times like you are peering through a window.  Well worth it.
B002CXLSYU|5.0|First, I got the DVD. The material is excelent. I am a really hard fan of Maiden, so I got the Blue Ray.  I was astonished. In a few movies I have seem so  dramatic diferences  between DVD and Bluy Ray as this concert.  I enjoyed every penny I put in that.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|For all those who love Spartacus: Blood and Sand, watch this if you already haven't!!  Great story lines that keep you on the edge of your seat.  I was an instant fan. Only wish there were more seasons.    **Warning: Not for younger viewers. There is nudity and lots of violence.
0316548189|4.0|I ordered this book last month with the Standard Order Procedure and I should have received it somewhere around November 17th-18th. But I received it much earlier, on November 2nd. I haven't yet started reading it, but i will soon. :)
B004498KPU|5.0|This is a great collection for die hard fans and especially new fans. Most of these videos are masterpieces. The younger generation now needs to experience the magic that was Michael Jackson. It's a shame they missed out on the MJ experience...the greatest entertainer/artist to ever live...and who will ever live. We were so lucky to have him the short time we did. Thank god we'll always have his music, voice, video, live stage performances and dance masterpieces.
0312370849|5.0|Beautifully written and well researched. This would make an amazing book.  This is one of the absolute best books I've read in many years! A story about inhumanity at its worst, humanity and hope at its best, and love.
B00006CXSS|5.0|We waited far too long to purchase our own copy of this outstanding series.  When The Pacific became available, we decided to also purchase Band of Brothers.  This is Television at its finest.
B000LCJ4AE|4.0|Who knows what secrets lie in the hearts of those employed in government agencies.  After growing up with this story and reading many accounts I believe that what's in the book actually happened and most of what's in the book is true.  It's obvious that some parts are specutlation on the part of Col. Corso.  How significant the the author's part in weapons development and bleeding technology to private industry leaves a question in my mind because as you read the book he makes reference to many reports and also discusses many reports he wrote.  It seemed to me as though he was a paper pusher.  There is no evidence provided for the meetings he said he had with private industry and most if not all were conducted between Col. Corso and one other representative of the industries mentioned.  He often names the industries in question and the people involved who he met with that helps substantiate his story but are not absolute proof.  It truly is an amazing story that leaves you wondering and watching.  It also leaves you with the view that our government is highly manipulative in a distasteful way leading us along as though we were sheep to an unknown destination.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|In 1987, the Beatles' recordings were finally remastered for release on compact disc. EMI decided to standardize the catalog, using the group's twelve regular British albums from 1963 to 1970 plus the American MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, originally released in 1967. This arrangement, while neatly confining the group's work to 13 CDs, left some gaps. A total of 33 tracks, originally released on various singles, EPS and compilation albums, were left unreleased. To remedy this situation, Beatles scholar Mark Lewisohn compiled two new compilations called  PAST MASTERS, which collected all these tracks together. They were released in March 1988. Both albums were combined later that year for LP and cassette release, but the CDs were sold separately until September 9, 2009.    Now with the release of the newly remastered Beatles catalog, PAST MASTERS is finally combined into a single package. The sound is excellent and marks the debut of the stereo versions of \\"From Me to You\\" and \\"Thank You Girl.\\"
072325804X|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful book. The illustrations are beautiful and the stories can be enjoyed by all. I am a college student and love these stories. I love that it has a fully illustrated case. The pages are large and thick. The shipping was very fast, too! I highly recommend this book!
030745455X|5.0|It's not enough to say that the second of Stieg Larsson's \\"Millennium Trilogy\\" is 'imaginative'' that underscores the lingual proficiency with which the story is told.  It's also not enough to say that it's 'interesting'- it will keep you at attention for days.  Stieg Larsson dances between genre lines to great effect, bending murder mystery and corporate narrative.  Told separately from chapter to chapter, the author gives all to engage the reader for both storylines.  In the chapters starring the series' dynamic heroine, Lisbeth Salander, you look thousands of yards on for the next installment of tale of journalist Mikael Blomqvist.  When his story gets dense, you look back to Salander.  And then it's 3 AM.<br /><br />If you're all for character depth, intriguing plotline and stunning worldview, by all means, go for it.  If not, Twilight may be more your speed.
0061906220|4.0|My daughter loves Pete the Cat and his white shoes. They listen to the CD and book in her preschool class. All the kids dance around, sing and they know all the words! This is an all time favorite!! I had to buy it because my daughter is constantly singing about her shoes and wants the 'cat book'.<br /><br />Highly recommend this for preschoolers!!
0316069485|4.0|The latest in the series ties together characters from many of the past books--Haller, Bosch, \\"McFierce\\", Walling.  The stable of characters is playing better together as time goes by, though readers not familiar with some of the earlier books might not know who these characters are.  But this is a Haller courtroom story and not a Bosch detective story, so I think some of the other reviews are a bit off the mark.  4-stars, a fun read.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|If you enjoyed the Ultimate Edtions for one and two do not buy this edtion it isn't worth the added cost.  There are five hours of documentry, which I may watch at some later time but not one of those hours the nice case or the \\"trading cards?\\" or whatever the hell they are, are worth the added cost.  If you all ready have an existing blu-ray copy of this flim don't give WB any more of your money you'll not get what you pay for.      It makes me angry to see WB resorting the same unreputable tactics so enjoyed by Gorge Lucas. This coupled with the unwieldy formt of the WB digital libry they force you to use for thier digital copies has really turned me from buying any more of their products.
0316096199|5.0|I read this book nearly a year ago and it never left me. It really impacted me and I'll never forget Alice's strong character. It's hard to read some chapters because they are so terrifying, but she writes not to create pity for herself. It truly is a story of triumph and bravery. Bravo to Alice Sebold!
0307389839|3.0|I was expecting great things from this book as it had rave reviews.  The only thing I discovered was a lukewarm, at best, story.  I disagree that it is the four month preparation for his New York City marathon as the story line jumps in and out of years and other events he has participated in.  There were two interesting passages in the book that seemed philosophical to me but other than that I feel the only reason he received a book contract on this is because he had prior published novels.  As a distance runner myself I found nothing of inspiration or encouragement in this book where the author could have seized the opportunity.  It was just \\"ok\\".
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|This adapter is good quality.  I have had no issues with sound or image since using it.  It might not be top of the line, but it's a great price and the swivel ability is incredibly useful. Saves a lot of wear and tear on the electronics port as well as bending the cord into a tight place.  Recommend!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The present tense did not work for me because I thought it was poorly executed. Had it been written in past tense, I'd have given this book 4 stars. I found the overall writing a bit clunky. The story itself was extremely engaging, albeit predictable. I loved the characters, though. They had great motivations and acted consistently. I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could. I liked it but not as much as most other readers did. I won't be reading the rest of the series.
0452289963|5.0|Accepting is wisdom even with the devil when you understand your situation  But do wish having the ultimate power to make the right reactions.      \\"You can not control what happens to you, but you can control your ATTITUDE towards what happens to you. And in that, you will be mastering change rather than allowing it to master you.\\"
0316069485|4.0|Connelly has lost a bit of momentum over the years, and the combining of half brothers Mickey Haller, a top-notch defense attorney, and Harry Bosch, hard-boiled veteran of the LAPD makes for plenty of conflict.  Both are now dealing with family and children for the first time, and some of the traits that made them great characters are only memories for long-time Connelly fans.      The story is fantastic.  Haller is brought over to the prosecution side to re-try a man that was convicted of killing a young girl nearly thirty years ago.  Haller's ex-wife is sitting second chair and Bosch serves as the investigator.  Rachel Walling, the disgraced FBI officer from The Poet, even makes an appearance.  This motley crew of characters makes for a bit of drama that never quite comes to a head.  All in all a great read.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I love this movie I have the dvd but I am trying to find the full version. For example in the version I have you see Tom Hanks repairing the steps or the door but you never see when they get broken also you see all the trees fall down but it doesn't have the scene where he tries to carve their names into the tree and knock them all down. I Know the full version is out there somewhere I have seen it many times on TV can anyone help me?
B003YP7N9O|2.0|I always thought it was Video, but maybe I'm wrong. Disc 1 is fine, Disc 2 is really good. And disc 3 is a complete waste, unless you like staring at the album cover for over an hour.  Why release an AUDIO ONLY disc that is the exact replica of another disc that's in the package. I knew it was too good to be true. Should have read the reviews more carefully.
B001VNB54A|3.0|I was reading the reviews prior to watching and didn't pay attention to many of them. One of them caught my eye though about how the story doesn't pick up until episode 5.  I would say spot on.  Overall, this HBO Series is not very good.  I was expecting a lot better in terms of story, drama, war scenes...everything.  Just not very good.  Summary:    Good:  1. The scene where the traks are heading to Peleliu - this is amazing and puts your right there on that day - mesmerizing scene - the best of the entire series...if you buy this it will be for this scene alone.  2. Episode on Okinawa - gives you the feel of how miserable it was there and how intense the battles could be  3. The transition scenes that zoom in on Map prior to each location/battle is superbly done    Bad:  1. Too much sex - no need for it...can't watch with kids under 17 really because of this  2. Japanese Soldiers seemed unrealistic - I mean it constantly showed them as stupid/dumb and zombie like just running into machine gun fire time and time again with no strategy or direction...Anyone who knows world War II and studies it knows the Japanese soldiers to be fierce and tough but definitely not stupid and zombie like. Made it seem like it was too easy for Marines to fight Japanese and we all know that was the entire opposite of what happened in Pacific War....Director/Writers really blew it on this one (shame on you Spielberg,Hanks!)  3. Not enough battle scenes, too many boring parts/dialogue and scenes in pavavuu, australia...away from the key battles...if they had focused each battle like the okinawa one...this would be compelling story....too much drag time.    Overall, not a good series...could have had so much more and been a classic...but looks like Hanks and Spielberg just stamped their name on this thing and kicked back and let people buy in based on real work done on Band of Brothers...greed and laziness produce bad results...too bad.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|With all the tension and drama within this movie, I was most inspired to know that a U.S. Marine can get laid anywhere in the world. Of particular note was the blonde pounding a headboard against a wall while the marine is driving home the object. Never saw this nonsense in Band or Savings Ryans Privates.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Ive recently watched this movie. Though it was not my first time watching it, something struck me this time around. From the astounding themes to the directing style of David Fincher, this is now one of my favorite movies of all time. If youve never seen this movie before, I strongly recommend you watch it (and the bluray experience is amazing). But when you watch it, do not think of it as a fighting/\\"guy\\" movie.
B002ZG997C|3.0|I've seen better! Denzel made the movie and if it wasn't for his action scenes, I would have fallen asleep very early. This movie starts off with 'Go Figure', in terms of guess what happened to mother earth? Don't take my word, see it for yourself.
B00127RAJY|4.0|i bought this in hopes of getting a good workout in 20 minutes and it certainly does the trick. i intended to do this for 30 days but caught a cold so had to stop. after i recovered, i had exactly 18 days left before leaving for hawaii. i figured i would see if i got any results after 15 days. i did level 1 for 5 days, had one day of rest then moved on to level 2. level 2 is where i felt the burn. that's when my arms started to shake and i could feel the knot in my abs. i just finished my 4th day and still find it challenging. i'm debating whether to try out level 3 for my last days before vacation. level 1 and 2 work you out in different ways and i'm curious to see what level 3 will do. i definitely lost inches and fat all around tho i'm not sure this workout will fully trim my waist and inner thighs to my satisfaction. i'm thinking of transitioning to pilates for that. for a 20 minute workout this is super excellent and highly recommended. it gives me no excuse since it's so short. she's annoying but once you get the moves, you can tune her out. also, for the reviewers that say you have to listen to the intro every time: i keep the dvd in the machine, turn it off and when i turn it back on, i'm taken right back to the level selection, bypassing the intro. the workouts can be hard on your knees but you just have to use your best judgment and modify as needed. all in all, two thumbs up!
B00406UK7S|4.0|No......it's not a Roman gladiator movie, but a solid flick centering on the fate, or in this case mostly the aftermath of the 9th Roman Legion massacre at the hands of the Picts in Roman occupied England. Please keep in mind this movie was shot on a relatively low budget (around 10 million) and filmed almost entirely on location in England and Scotland, with NO CGI or digital effects other than post editing digital correction. If you watch the special features, you can see what the cast and crew went through to film this movie (actual filming in the snow and mountains, barren areas and cold waterfalls to name a few) and I think it might give you a new perspective on how you view the film.    Not wanting to ruin the movie for first timers, I'll simply say that the acting is solid, the premiss takes on some creative license and objectivity, but in a very well done manner, and the scenery, as already mentioned, is realistic, accurate, and at times stunning. There is some blood and gore in this film, that I see as mostly appropriate to the story line, and you will have to buy into the movie and it's genre to truly enjoy and appreciate it. All in all, a solid effort.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|There are far more extensive reviews than this one, and quite frankly, at the cost, you should be pouring through old headfi.org forum posts along with the twenty different reviews you can find online. You can though enjoy these cans out of the box despite some of the naysayers. I can certainly hear where some of the syllabic, too much tonal noise will relax and the sound separation will become more expansive as these get used. That said, the wide open soundstage, the immediate presence of the instruments, and terrific production with certain music: jazz trio, electronic ambient, folk, and classical make this rewarding right away, and even better, you have cans that will return the investment of simply using them. Switching between genres will bring out some of the challenges in these cans. Basically, a genre where it is has a hard time playing succinctly, like hard rock, will need to be played lossless. My general barometer for considering buying these would be this: how much noise, outside of classical, is in music you dig? Metal, hard rock, and some techno, especially if looking for booming bass, will come up short, but at this price level, you could get Sennheisers or Grados and blast away.
B003PIUBZS|3.0|Well, I thought I was going to find a mini-series on par with HBO's Rome.  Spartacus doesn't hold a candle to the Rome masterpiece.  I found Spartacus to be a \\"bloody mess\\".  Evey cut of the sword equaled a flash of red on the screen....made me sick.  I didn't find the characters engaging. Though Lucy Lawless was excellent. The settings couldn't hold a candle to Rome.  I know that a computer generated backgrounds for both but I enjoy the architecture, and splendor that was Rome. I watched all the episodes just cause I wanted to see how the season ended....more blood.  I'd give it a C and wouldn't recommend it unless you like lots and lots of bloody gladiator scenes. Purchase Rome and enjoy the glory of it's age.  Secondly, Andy Whitfield who does a really good job as Spartacus won't be in the pre-quill as he is ill....I wish him all the best for a good recovery.
142311339X|5.0|This novel continues the story of Percy Jackson.  This is a great novel and a great series.  The only complaint I have is that I have to wait until next year for the next book in the series to come out.
0307588335|5.0|I cannot see how anyone could give book below 3 stars? It gives a terrific insight into the workings of what was once one of the most \\"successful\\" investment firms on Wall Street. Do the reviewers giving such low ratings actually have sympathy for those like Mr. Fuld and Mr. Gregory? Hard to believe! Because their actions and inactions are the contributing factors as to why we suffered such economic calamity. The bottom line rules regardless of how it is created. Larry McDonald may have been on the trading floor but he offers excellent insight as to the workings of such a firm. This book also details the process by which these horrific mortgages were written to the poor in the name of short term profits for the \\"bodybuilder\\" salesmen and how they allowed the rise of these bubble companies like NewCentury and Countrywide. And thankfully Mr. McDonald gives minor detail to his personal life instead focusing on the issues at hand.     One would have to hold the \\"blame government for everything\\" mentality - so prevalent in todays weak minded society- to not understand how American business poisoned their own well and that of much of the world as a result. And how this will continue to happen without significant and effective regulation of the markets. And perhaps the reinstatement of legislation like Glass-Steagall. As long as we remain ignorant of how these massive businesses work this will continue to happen. Wall Street essentially became Vegas and the American people were the big losers. Proof that a free market is indeed a failed concept nominally because of human greed, the continuous drive for profit - regardless the costs that come later. The difficulting many may encounter in reading such an account is that the average American has little to no understanding of the workings and underpinnings of our economic system. Once you begin to have even a semblance of understanding you realize how we continually get into trouble. The short term is seldom measured against the long term.     Thank you Mr. McDonald for giving your insight.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|As with all others from my generation of 80's kids, I Love this movie. This is one of THE most iconic films for both teens and younger kids, and I can only imagine that it will be clear and amazing on Bul-ray. Additionally, all these bonus goodies are fantastic for die-hard collectors, but not really necessary if you simply wish to just let the movie serve as all the awesomeness you need. The one thing I aboslutely must discredit this release for, even in spite of giving it 5 stars (solely for the movie and bonus features, as they are the same as the 2001 release), is the lame cover picture. First off, why is it that studios feel the need to change the original artwork that served as the Theatrical Release poster!? DVD releases make these cheesy cover pictures thinking they are fresh and new marketable ideas that are going to work at selling the movie. Well newsflash, this movie has a cult following (myself included) that will love the movie no matter what, but would prefer that it at least show a picture of the cast. The 2001 release wasn't a drastic deviation of the formula used for the original, but this cover is cheesy and I hate it.     Lastly, what would make this release really bitchin', is to include the out-of-print soundtrack. Seems like a no brainer, even if you omit a few songs, just include the best songs. I own the soundtrack personally (actually I own 3, they're still available and cheap in Japan), but I'd like to see other fans get that little something extra instead of a board game many are unlikely to play. I'm just saying.
1439181780|4.0|This book is very basic...but it's a good refresher for those who are trying to move into a different level of consciousness. I liked reading a few paragraphs at bedtime or to start my day.  The Secret was far too materialistic.  This book seems more open ended so that the reader decides the direction to apply the simplified wisdom gleaned from other authors.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I ordered this album along with two other that I was, honestly, more excited about--this one was to help get me over the minimum for free shipping.  So I did not expect it to be my favorite of the cds I ordered, much less one of my new favorite albums overall.  My boyfriend even likes this album, despite being a staunch hard-rock fanatic.<br /><br />Florence doesn't follow convention, avoiding the equation that many of today's bands use to write a \\"hit\\" song.  The sound throughout this album is unique and BIG, though she does break up the symphonic pieces with some that are a little more laid-back in sound, though not in content.  The diversity ranges from a blues-inspired dark and jazzy \\"Girl With One Eye,\\" to the song \\"Kiss With a Fist\\" which manages to be quirky and fun despite unconventional lyrics.  I am afraid to say that I regularly skip track three, \\"I'm Not Calling You A Liar,\\" simply because it does not hold a candle to the songs surrounding it, in my personal opinion.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are easily \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)\\", \\"Howl\\", \\"Drumming Song\\", and \\"Cosmic Love.\\"  They are complex and intense in such a way that I am compelled to turn the volume up as high as my ears can stand--I know it sounds cheesy, but they are emotional and simultaneously captivating and freeing.  Florence herself has an impressive female voice--decent range, excellent projection.  Definitely a cd I would recommend to others.
B0043X8M0K|5.0|I however love the show very much I do love the music they put on there and enjoy the cd very much.
0553805371|4.0|Stephen Hawking starts with explaining that the age of philosophers is over, and a physicist is the new philosopher. That is taking things to the extreme right, but Stephen Hawking is trying to make a point here, the point being that there would be a theory (or set of theories) that could explain the universe in its entirety. Point taken.  In this book, Stephen Hawking (along with Leonard Mlodinow) explains m-theory and quantum theory in plain simple words so that a layman can understand it. You don't have to toggle between a scientific dictionary and this book, which mostly happens when you read some of the scientific books. This doesn't mean that a scientific reader would find this book less appealing.   The book has been written with a goofy sense of humor, with a few cartoons thrown into make the topic relatively lighter and enjoyable. In all, a worthwhile read.
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|I have a problem in that my A/V receiver is almost too large for my entertainment cabinet, so while I have just enough room to plug HDMI cables in, they end up a little smooshed/crimped by the back of the cabinet.<br /><br />This swivel adapter solves the problem by making it so my HDMI cables face up from my A/V receiver instead of out from it.<br /><br />The only issue is that it's a little thick, so if you're hoping to use it behind a thin, wall mounted TV or something, it may be too big to fit in a port that doesn't have a lot of clearance.<br /><br />Recommended overall.
B000002KCV|5.0|True to his professional approach to authentic recording Neil has again surmounted the obstacle of remaining himself and just presenting the finest listening and greatest entertainment to his loyal fans.  I only wish that I could be sitting in front of him and his band as he rolls out this current lineup of classics... if only to take in the reaction by his audience.  Neil seems to understand the value of solid vintage musical harmony between his creativity and his delivery.  Keep 'em coming, Neil.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|The 3-star and lackluster reviews are all from people who love the old stuff and hate that their favorite band has become more mainstream with its last few albums.  Most of them admit the songs are pretty catchy and well-produced, but they long for the days before band got discovered...when they were dangerous.  I've got a response for that: this album is KOL's best.  Face it--anyone who thinks it's easy to write a collection of songs that are melodic, memorable, and singable can tell you that it's not selling out...it's a SKILL.  Sure, there are TERRIBLE, overly-simplistic disposable pop songs with nothing interesting to say.  There are millions of them.  And I am a fan of a number of bands with complicated and obscure albums.  This KOL album, though, is accessible for a REASON--the SONGS are great.  The vocals are STRONGER than they were, and the lead singer is COMMUNICATING better than ever before.  Listen to their first album sometime.  I imagine to 90% of the world, it's kind of unlistenable.  You can barely understand a single word (and I live in the South).  It sounds like Tom Petty drank three straight bottles of whiskey and then got hit over the head with a shovel until he started bleeding from his nose.  Sure, Sex Pistols fans find that to be a great recommendation, but THIS album, Come Around Sundown, invokes all the lessons learned on the previous albums and then stretches out with real melodies and vocals that could, as some reviewers say, catapault the band into U2 territory with songs that make people FEEL something.  I'll put &#34;The End&#34; from this album up against &#34;Spiral Staircase&#34; any time.  Sometimes success is actually a sign that something GOOD is going on and that a band it getting better at what it does.  Listen to the clips.  You'll hear the rock, you'll hear that voice, and you'll hear something uplifting and earnest.  You won't hear any processed, over-produced, pandering.  This music is from the heart and the band now has theskills to tell the musical stories that they want to tell.  Reviewers who say otherwise are probably just finding that music sounds different when you're 16 and it's hard to recreate that feeling in later years.  Get over it.  This album is great.
B0041CGP02|5.0|Bon Jovi did it again. Anyone that doesnt like this and is writing crappy reviews are just ridiculous. They not only give us two full cds of hits but give us 4 extra brand new \\"hit\\" songs. Bon Jovi does a lot for their fans. They stream live concerts on youtube and facebook. They give presale tickets and dicounted tickets. Most important if theyre still around selling out stadiums hitting high on the charts thats why theyre still around.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Spartacus - blood and sand exceeded our expectations! We thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it!  A cracking good story, plenty of violence and gratuitous sex! What more could you want? The fight scenes were incredible and very realistic. We were on the edge of our seat through every episode. We are looking forward to season 2.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This movie is perfect for the whole family. It's hilarious and has a heart-warming storyline. Will Ferrell was awesome as Megamind, the villian and Metro Man's archenemy. On the day Metro Man is being honored by the city, Megamind breaks out of jail with the help of a talking fish named Minion and kidnaps Roxanne Ritchi. Megamind finally defeats Metro Man and takes over the city. Over time, Megamind grows bored and wants an enemy to fight. He creates a serum of Metro Man's DNA in order to create a superhero, but along the way, he disguises himself as a museum curator named Bernard and starts to fall in love with Roxanne.  After he accidentally turns Roxanne's cameraman, Hal into a hero, he uses his power for evil. Megamind must stop him, save the girl, and become the hero himself. I highly recommend MEGAMIND!!!
0525951652|4.0|Before purchasing this book (Kindle) I read the reviews and was troubled by the mixed reviews. I have read \\"Pillars\\" and the sequel and enjoyed them very much.   This book is similar to Pillars in structure, with several good stories running at the same time with very different characters that sometimes intersect. Good historical background on WWI and the issues that people were struggling with at that time. All in all, very entertaining and informative. I would highly recomend it.
B00448SE4S|5.0|A very fun movie.  I know it won't win any awards, but just terrific entertainment.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Oh, I see all of you at the water cooler now, wondering what I will review next. Taking bets and sending me urgent e mails. I tell ya people, I am fast becoming the most talked about item in our modern a go-go society. Why, they even tell me I've already surpassed that \\"Who Shot J.R.\\" thing from years ago. What? You don't remember that one? Well, to be honest, I hardly do. I think I was in Tangier at the time. Meeting dignataries, need you ask?<br /><br />Anyway, Halloween was just a short while ago, so I decided to watch a movie that would scare my pet dragon and octopus. So, I got this copy of \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" and settled in to watch it on my 60 inch HD t.v. with digital surround sound. I tell ya people, hearing flesh rip and blood spurting has never sounded more realistic. What a refreshing pleasure. (!!!).<br /><br />The plot revolves around a brother and sister driving home together from college. Trish and Darry Jenner do the typical sibling annoyances we all know and love. They pass a house and see this shadowy figure dump tied up bodies into a tunnel. If that wasn't enough to freak them out, the stranger gets into a truck and tries to run them off the road. After he passes, Darry, stupidly, gets hit with some perverted moral conscience and decides to return to investigate. Trish is not happy, and even more unhappy when Darry drops into the tunnel. What he spies down there is a horror beyond his wildest dreams. He eventually finds his way out and they take off to contact the authorities.<br /><br />Without giving all the plot away, this movie is about the evil stranger pursuing them. I like the suspense this movie provides and the jolts of horror throughout.<br />Wisely, the unknown terror is what gives the movie it's impact. You never really see the Creeper from the start. As the scenes unfold, you get to glimpse, slowly, what this creature is and, eventually, why it is pursuing them. To say that the Creeper is hideous would be an understatement. To say that Metamorpho writes the best reviews in the universe, is an understatement as well. But, that is where all similarities end, thank-you.<br /><br />We learn that this creature surfaces every 23 years and has to feed off bodies (especially young people), for, to do so, he develops regenerative ability. Thus,  it's hard to kill this thing. The creature is a living, breathing, Wright Brothers Beelzebub, and also a Kitty Hawk. But, in order to really get that insanely clever line, you have to see the movie. In truth, I jumped out of my seat quite a few times and there was popcorn all over the floor. It's a good thing I hired a cleaning crew to take care of such matters.<br /><br />Anyway, a pretty entertaining horror film. I gave it 3 1/2 - 4 stars. It held your interest by maintaining an underlying dread. My other underlying dread was the fear of running out of Halloween candy for the kiddies. The movie I can deal with, but egging my castle windows is another situation entirely.<br /><br />Yours to your blood runs cold -- Metamorpho ;)reviews in the universe, is an understatement as well.

B002ZG993Q|1.0|This was a waste of 9 perfectly good RMB. Warning: Plot spoilers.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary:<br /><br />1. We are introduced to George Clooney in a cabin with his woman. When they are getting ready to leave and go out into the winter snow, he sees some sharpshooters (apparently there to send him to meet his maker) and shoots them dead. He also shoots his woman in the head.<br />2. Later, he has to go to Italy to hide out.<br />3. He makes friends with a priest there. (I guess this was taking him in the direction of Redemption.)<br />4. Clooney's character also seems to have a real taste for hookers. So, over one of his many visits to pay-for-play houses he finds one hooker that he particularly likes and gives her Oral Pleasure. (Sure, I bet *that's* never happened to her before. I sure can see why that would be enough to make a girl fall in love and leave the hooking business after a single visit.)<br />5. The agent/ broker who has been sending him places also seems to have hired a woman to kill Clooney's character after he delivered a gun to her that he thought that he was making for someone else but that she actually was going to use to kill him. (It comes out that she is working for Clooney's Agent-Broker).<br />6. Clooney meets the Hooker Girlfriend at some place, and his Gun Customer finds him and puts his head into the crosshairs. After his Would-be asssassin stands there looking at him and his girlfriend for about 45 minutes. At minute #46, god-only-knows who shoots her in the head and Clooney goes up to her vantage point and finds that she is still breathing (with half of her head missing) long enough to tell him that his Agent-Broker is the one who hired him (as if he couldn't figure that out when people came all the way to this obscure Italian village to kill him).<br />7. As he is fleeing the scene (where no police come in spite of enough gunfire to attract at least some attention), Clooney walks away. Behind him is the Agent-Broker who raises the gun to shoot him, but Clooney (somehow) knows that he is there and turns around and shoots him dead. Then Clooney gets into the car and drives away (again, no police).<br />8. As he is driving toward the location at which he told the Hooker Girlfriend to meet him, we find out that he has been hit. (Seems that he didn't know until after driving away for a few miles). He sees the hooker while driving and dies behind the steering whille.<br /><br />This is one of the silliest movies that I've ever seen.  Plot details that are left unanswered. (Who did Clooney work for? Why was his Agent-Broker a double dealer? Why did he shoot his first woman in the head? How were there never any police anywhere at any time useful? Things that just come out nowhere.) Rauchy sex scenes that didn't do much for the plot (this *was* supposed to be a thriller, after all).<br /><br />I can only guess that Clooney wanted to see how much his acting could save/carry a desperate/ lashed-together plot. (There has to be at least one rational reason that he would put his name on this rubbish.)<br /><br />Thank God for pirated DVDs, because I would have needed to be put in restraints if I'd paid the price of a movie ticket to see this film.mehow) knows that he is there and turns around and shoots him dead.

1881273563|5.0|I took a class on this book and then years later was given the book as a wedding gift but i wouldn't just suggest it for those looking at getting married (and I would suggest it for them) but for those who struggle to understand why the way they are talking to people doesn't elicit the response they were looking for. This is a great book about learning to speak to other people in their language, their love language, so that the gap of communication can be lessened, or closed. I highly recommend for a gift or a reference guide in the family library.
0553805371|5.0|I can't say I understood everything in this book, but there was plent enough to keep me fascinated. And it answered the question we all want to know: \\"Why are we here?\\" I did not have to abandon my religious/spiritual beliefs, but the answer to creation does not require a \\"god\\" as most of us understand God. You must also read \\"A Brief History of Time\\" by Hawking.  Good luck!
B003MC5N28|5.0|Being an older reader, I found this book just by chance. It is very, very  thoughtprovoking. An excellent dystopia book. Give it to your children, aunts,  uncles, cousins, grandmothers and grandfathers to read.......
B002ZG981E|1.0|I had a strange experience while watching this film.  It reminded me of other films I did not like much, and made me wish I was watching them instead.  I had disliked \\"The Matrix\\", but this film reminded me how much more lively and involving it was.  I had disliked \\"Shutter Island\\", but was reminded how much more colorful and atmospheric it was, with more likable characters, and how it seemed to have a more genuine dreamlike quality.<br /><br />Its fans praise it for its intelligence, but I can sense nothing of the sort in it.  It does carry with it, however, a stench of nihilism and solipsism, and the human mind engaging in self-worship.  There was little to engage the mind, though I did note the symbolism of the Escher staircase, which seemed to suggest that those who try to descend or ascend to higher or deeper levels of dreaming - or who try to wake up to \\"reality\\" - are in fact merely going around in circles.  Like the ouroboros, it also seems to suggest the mind turning in on itself; though I get a vague sense that Chris Nolan approves of the horrible process.
B0026JWDQW|4.0|This album is a nice departure from Paolo's first album.  He continues to experiment with classic world music formats while maintaining a hooky pop approach.  Don't expect \\"New Shoes\\", Paolo is growing up and pushing himself to evolve.  Happily, I can say he is successful.
B0043RSIUK|5.0|it is unfortunate that some people based there review on the price rather than the book. this book, like all ken follett books, was an amazing read!! my only disappointment is having to wait two years for the second book.
1421527618|3.0|Pretty good for what it is: a short, sweet, fun sci-fi story.  I thought the dramatic structure could have used some brushing up, but given the deliberate repetitiveness of the timeline, that would probably be a difficult task.  I think adding some length to it could have helped to flesh out the supporting cast and to build the dramatic tension, but then I would probably be on here complaining that it was too long for a popcorn book of this type :/    I would recommend this book to anyone just looking for a quick escape.  It shouldn't take you more than a few hours to read.  Given the short amount of time it requires, I thought it was worth it.    I believe a film adaptation is in the works, though, and I think the story will likely work much better on screen.  The book includes a lot of scenes that imply some killer visuals, but the author didn't quite have the chops to make the images come alive through words.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|It's about time an album like this comes out!  The last time I fell in love with an album like this was Paramore's Brand New Eyes...which wasn't that long ago, but it has been a year :)<br /><br />Well worth the price!  I love every song on this album...HIGHLY Recommend!  Every song has a great beat, lyrics, etc.  I'm transported to a worry free place and can just relax and enjoy the moments that the songs take me to!  ENJOY!
B003XQG0JI|5.0|I don't usually do reviews, but was inspired to do so this time.    It's obvious, when listening to this production, that Sharon Corr and whoever recorded and produced it (Billy and Tim, I suppose) put in a lot of time and effort - getting it right !  Most songs are quite beautiful and well chosen, but at least a couple of them might be better described as \\"an aquired taste.\\"    I highly recommend it, though, especially if you're a Corrs fan. I could also recommend it for the CD's cover photos...Sharon is beyond beautiful !

0756405890|1.0|Kvothe is perhaps the most cliched and over-compensating character in the history of literature.  I say \\"perhaps\\" because I haven't done the requisite legwork required to be absolutely certain. I am fairly confident, however, that he is the worst single character I have ever read.<br /><br />Kvothe is the typical Mary Sue character.  He's larger than life, smarter than everyone, and just around better at everything (including showing up his teachers).  Why?  Just because.  I understand that no one writes a book about \\"Joe the Commoner\\" but Kvothe just goes above and beyond.  One or two unique or unbelievable talents wouldn't be surprising but Kvothe piles one on top of the other on top of the next for no other reason than: \\"Rothfuss thinks its cool!\\"  He's writing like a 5-year old: \\"If I was a superhero this is how awesome I would be!\\"  Just detestable to anyone who has standards.<br /><br />Not to mention the writing.  It was good at times but generally mediocre.  The dialogue was worse.  Someone needs to read a little Jane Austen to learn how to write an actual conversation...<br /><br />Reading a little P&P would also give Rothfuss a chance to learn how to write female characters.  All of his characters are cardboard cutouts who are extremely forgettable (usually there just to get saved/embarrassed by Kvothe) but the women are the worst.  Utterly uninteresting and one dimensional, they are present for the sole purpose of reflecting Kvothe's awesome and lusting after him.  Rothfuss didn't bother to give them personalities or even cursory descriptions so I'm surprised he bothered with names.  In book two we'll probably see the emergence of memorable characters such as \\"Girl A\\" and \\"Concubine Number 3\\".  I mean, honestly, at least try to do more than create a backdrop for Kvothe's awesomeness.  Rothfuss clearly cares nothing for his world.  His message is clear: \\"Kvothe is sweet.  I wish I was him.\\"<br /><br />In a related note: the relationship between Kvothe and the main female lead (whose name I have forgotten) is forced and far from believable.  Rothfuss was unable to sell anything in the way of chemistry between them.  Or between Kvothe and anyone else for that matter...<br /><br />This just shows you how practical getting a Masters Degree in \\"Creative Writing\\" is (coming from someone who has a Masters in a real field).  That's like getting a Masters in Hockey and expecting to be able to play in the NHL.

B003XKB0RG|5.0|Over 35 years now, EWF has been making music the world wants to listen to. Pan-ethnic, crossing R&B with jazz, funk and rock and roll, with even a little gospel and blues thrown in, Maurice White's vision of a musical group that would 'touch the world' became a reality.     \\"Faces\\", which was originally released in 1980, truly showcases the band's artistic and musical mastery--more than any of their other albums prior to or since. The title track, especially (which I believe was nominated for a Grammy for best instrumental) has extraordinary horn passages, brought to life with the Phoenix Horns' renowned musical acumen. They really did their homework on this one. Although not as big a commercial success as, say, \\"All n' All\\" or \\"I Am\\" or others, \\"Faces\\" nonetheless shines as a standalone achievement in musical prowess. Right from the get-go, the listener is blasted with a combination of electronic synthesizer trills and horn rises as \\"Let Me Talk\\" opens with a 3-beat melody line that is easily recognizable and fun to move to.     Throughout the album we are treated to Maurice's powerful lines, and Phillip Bailey's soaring, angelic falsetto on songs such as \\"You Went Away\\".     If you're an EWF fan, and have not heard \\"Faces\\", you have missed out. If you're a purist who can't get enough of big horn riffs (the type that Tower of Power copied time and again) and lyrics that are actually meaningful, uplifting and purposeful, this album will fill the bill, hands down.    I first heard this album 30 years ago as a 15-year old freshman in high school, blasting it out on my record player at home until my folks shouted to turn it down. So I recorded it onto a Maxell tape, borrowed my best friend's newfangled tape Walkman, and blasted it while walking through the halls or riding my bike to the park downtown. I could not get enough of it. And 30 years later, I still know every song by heart.    Get it. Listen to it. Eat it up. You'll be glad you did.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This is the true story of Pope John Paul II, and the actor portraying him is wonderful in the part.  This is the second one that I purchased, as it was a gift for one of my brother's and his wife, and they were overjoyed to receive it. I would recommend it for anyone as a lovely family story.  It does not matter if you are Catholic or of any faith.  It is inspirational to all.
B003Y8YXGM|5.0|I don't mean lush as in this particular \\"lost\\" period of John's adventures sans Yoko.....but Lush with strings and saxophones and horn charts.  The remastered classic sounds better now than it did then.  AND IT SOUNDED DAMN GOOD THEN!  I'd forgotten what brilliant compositions \\"Scared\\" and \\"Steel and Glass\\" were.  A Lennon and Beatle fan must-own.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I know it's a bit unfair to judge \\"The Pacific\\" in comparison to \\"Band of Brothers,\\" but its almost impossible not too, especially since its marketed that way. Band of Brothers is amazing, so anything judged against that backdrop has an automatic disadvantage. With that being said, The Pacific is a well-made mini-series in and of itself. You can tell from the get-go that the producers gave this miniseries an extremely high budget.<br /><br />Where it kind of falls short, again, in comparison to Band of Brothers, is that we are almost disconnected from the alot of the characters in the series. This is due to a couple of reasons. First, Unlike BofB, where we follow Easy Company from bootcamp to the D-Day and beyond, The Pacific almost throws us into the war against Japan immediately. Because of that, I didn't feel emotionally connected to the characters until way later on. Another byproduct, or in conjunction to it, of throwing us into the war immediately, is that it isn't until the third \\"episode\\" or so, that you really know who is whom (throw in a bunch of marines in uniform, and it can get pretty confusing). Second, where we follow a company of soldiers in BofB, The Pacific follows three indidvidual characters. So when their buddies get blown up to smitherieenes, as they often do, stictly in the sense of a movie-watcher- because I didn't develop any attachment to those \\"side\\" characters- I didn't really feel a great emotional tug. For example, in one episode, as one of the main character's buddy gets killed, we see by his acting that he is really distraught, however, I was left thinking \\"who was that?\\"<br /><br />Another thing I found strange- and I say this without knowing which is more accurate (BofB or The Pacific) is that the Americans in the Pacific seem to be more grotesque than the Soldiers in Europe. Certainly, they were much more liberal with their usage of the F-word and \\"Mother F-ers\\" than in BofB. All the while  writers/director of the Pacific seemed to be more \\"racially sensitive.\\" I don't know if that was a conscious effort, but in BofB Americans referred to the Nazis as \\"Krauts\\" a deragatory term for Germans. We know from history, that Americans during WWII were more racist against Japanese who they viewed as savages, while Germans were more like \\"cousins.\\" But in the Pacific the American Marines referred to the Japanese only as \\"Japs,\\" and not more offensive words, though we know they used them. Another reason why I found the Soldiers in The Pacific to be more grotesque, is that they seemed to \\"break\\" much easier, and more often. Two of the three main characters seem to jump back and forth between insanity and \\"normality\\" quite often.<br /><br />Strictly on the basis of film watching, there are a couple things the Pacific could have done better at. For example, in BofB there were a few episodes that were really creative (the Episode where in the opening scene Major Winters shoots a surrendering SS soldier comes to mind) including some with a narrative. This is lacking in The Pacific. The Pacific is strictly a linear detail of events. Creativity on the level of BofB, narration, and interviews of actual soldeirs the series is based upon is totally lacking.<br /><br />As a historical event, you truly feel appreciative of these men- these are true stories afterall. However from a standpoint of filmwatching, the Pacific is a bit of a disappointment- partly because of the development (or lack thereof) of the series, and partly because of the unfair comparison to BofB. As a stand-alone mini series, The Pacific is a very solid piece of work. Just don't expect it to be on the same level as BofB.lly sensitive.\\" I don't know if that was a conscious effort, but in BofB Americans referred to the Nazis as \\"Krauts\\" a deragatory term for Germans.

0446195529|1.0|I'm sick of this new \\"screw the ereader market\\" pricing.  Charging the same price for ebook and hardback is ridiculous!  This is price gouging for the new adopters.    And for those that don't like reviews on price, COST IS PART OF THE \\"VALUE\\" OF A BOOK, not just the content.  You don't like it, don't read the reviews!  It's not that hard to figure out by the title the review is of the COST, and skip on past.
0525951652|5.0|This review starts off with a warning that it will be biased.  Until fairly recently, Ken Follett was known as \\"the greatest living writer no one has ever heard of.\\"  That started to change when Oprah discovered his epic \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" Follett wrote a sequel, and the Starz network ran a miniseries of it this past summer.  Yet my personal discovery of Ken Follett happened in the mid '80s, when I ordered \\"The Man from St Petersburg\\" from a discount book catalog.  At the time it was the first book that made me scream out loud with the vivid description and gut wrenching plot turns.    For the next twenty-five years I read everything Mr. Follett wrote and had the pleasure of meeting him at a book signing in October, 2007.  He is slotted as a spy thriller author, but he also wrote a successful non-fiction book called \\"On Wings of Eagles\\" which became a mini series.  It concerned Ross Perot's successful commando raid on an Iranian prison where two of his EDS employees had been held captive during the 1979 hostage crisis.  Many people recommended it during Ross Perot's unsuccessful presidential runs.    Ken Follett has also written a thriller set during the space race (Code to Zero), a psychological thriller involving Victorian era banking families (A Dangerous Fortune), and even one odd thriller about a group of hippies who stimulates earthquakes to thwart the government's attempts to build a dam (Hammer of Eden).      And now, he has embarked on the Century trilogy, which follows five families from the beginnings of World War 1 through the Cold War.  \\"Fall of Giants,\\" the first offering, debuted in late September and arrived on bookstore shelves as a 1,000 page volume.    Of course, the 1000 pages fly.  Ken Follett's strength is building an immersive world for the reader, that on occasion seems realistic enough to step into.  At the beginning he describes Billy Williams' ride on the coal mine elevator on his first day, as a thirteen year old.  The older miners purposely avoid telling him the way the elevator works (it free falls for several hundred feet before brakes damp it and slow it down to a stop at the bottom).  This is like the ride \\"Twilight Zone Tower of Terror\\" at Disney World.  Many other descriptions of this type follow, from trench warfare to the tense atmosphere at an aristocratic mansion.    Another Ken Follett strength is the women in his novels.  Generally there is at least one strong, memorable woman character, but in \\"Fall\\" he portrays two of them (Ethel Williams and Lady Maud Fitzherbert).  Lady Maud falls for a charming German  aristocrat, Walter, which forms one of the heartrending romantic subplots for the novel, with plenty of foreshadowing about dire things to come for the next two sequels.    One of the families involved with the story involves the brothers Lev and Grigori Peshkov, who start out as impoverished and overworked Russian factory hands.  Fate takes one of them to Buffalo New York and elevates the other to a high position in the fledgling Soviet government.  Again, it will be interesting to see how their story plays out in the next installments.    An unfair criticism of Ken Follett is that he uses cliches in dialogue and description.  This is part of the shorthand he uses to make his prose transparent and immersive and he offsets the \\"weakness\\" by drawing vivid, lifelike characters in fine strokes.  Billy William's wife Mildred is described as beautiful but with buck teeth and a tendency toward raunchy jokes and behavior in mixed circumstances.    For readers who may fear that they will have to buy all three installments, read all three volumes to get the full effect of the story, have no fear.  Ken Follett deftly ties together all of the story lines involving the five families, without leaving any dangling ends.  \\"Fall of Giants\\" is a stand-alone volume that will leave readers clamoring for more.
0345505387|2.0|I am a big fan of Diana Gabaldon and her Outlander series.  I own and have read all the books in the series.  I guess I just don't have an appreciation for a graphic novel.  Besides Claire, I had a hard time telling who was who.  I looked at it at the bookstore and decided to get it from the library instead.  I am really glad I didn't buy it.  I did not like the book.

I get the \\"evolution\\" of the artist stuff, but, to my opinion, she´s going backwards: artistic and personally.    I bought all her CDs since \\"Pies Descalzos\\".  I used to be a fan.    I´ll have to hear her next CD first before buying it; so i won´t waste my money again like i did on \\"Sale el Sol\\".    Don´t waste your money.  Wouldn´t buy it again.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I have a Canon T2i and although it takes wonderful video I needed to have good quality sound. The Zoom H4N is the perfect solution for my budgetary needs. It has other features that are also great but I bought it for field recording. I compared it to other onboard mics and this was much better. I wasn't crazy about it as an extention mic. I use it as a stand alone microphone and I'm very happy with it.
B003UBTX7C|1.0|This is nuts! Publishers think about this for a minute. A book can be shared (free after the purchase)...A book can be checked out at the library (free)...A book can be read at the bookstore (free)...When will the publishers listen?  I talk to so many people now who would rather wait until the price comes down before they will read the book.  Is time value of money worth nothing?

B002AT4K9G|5.0|Fast and Furious is one of the most thrilling, nail-biting, attention keeping movies. Having the main characters back in the same movie again is interesting because it helps you relate back to the very first movie that was created. Although one scene makes some viewers wonder if the movie should have been released before Tokyo Drift. One of the characters making a statement about keeping it real in Tokyo. In Tokyo Drift, the character who made the statement died. Other than that flaw, the movie kept the viewer very interested by fatal tragedies and the intense adventures the characters take. With Paul Walker and Vin Diesel teaming up once again, the two men continue their fearless, lawless ways in order to continue their quest.The main view of the movie is that Vin Diesel, showing his bad boy side, is trying to seek revenge from a loss of a loved one. Losing Letty in the movie was a real let-down in my opinion because she was the bad girl of the movie who was a total match to Vin Diesels character. Also, in my opinion, this movie is by far the best Fast and Furious sequel ever made.

031603438X|5.0|A 10-year self-professed heroin junkie isn't supposed to remember much.  Yet Keith Richards has amazing recollection of the meaningful and silly events that have made up his \\"Life.\\"  Better still, he has a wonderful way of relaying the stories in a way that feels natural and conversational, almost putting the reader in the room as the event happens.      What I've come to admire about one of my guitar heroes-- is his consistancy.  He values loyalty and friendship above all else.  He's the guy you want in your bunker if heading into battle, because he will jump on the grenade to save a platoon.      The stories behind the music are riviting-- but he also breaks down his playing in a fairly understandable way for aspiring artists.      The gossip hounds will enjoy his brutally honest recollections of the Stones' infighting, the who-said-what and the reaction words can create-- to the point where you wonder if the group WILL follow through with a rumored album after this book.  But in the end Keith is as hard on himself as he is on Mick, Charlie, or Ronnie.     The only thing not driven home is that while Keith focused much of the book around his heroin addiction-- he doesn't make it clear (or remind the reader enough) he was smoking pot and/or boozing every day since he started the band.  That's sort of a given-unwritten in Keith's world.    If you're looking for an interesting candid bio-- look no further.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|We love the 24 series and have every season on DVD.  I don't know how many times in the past few years where my wife and I will look at each others and say, \\"what would Jack do?\\" when we watch the news and hear about another terrorist attack.  It really is life imitating art!  If I had to rank the series, season 8 would have to be somewhere near the top 3 and watching it on a blu-ray player is awesome!!
142311339X|5.0|My 9 year old son loves everything by Rick Riordan. He's read the entire Percy Jackson series, the first 39 Clues, and a couple others. He was excited to receive 'The Heroes of Olympus: The Lost Hero' by Riordan but was hesitant about whether it could stand up to the Percy Jackson series. My son absolutely devoured the book, he started reading it, and didn't want to stop. He said it was fantastic and cannot wait for the next book to come out. He's currently writing a book report about it for school. We are eagerly awaiting the next book!
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I've been a Bushnell fan since I bought my first in 2000, before they were USGA legal to use (used it on the range).  I had the model before this one without the \\"pinseeker\\" mode.  While it was a bit difficult to hit the flag > 200 yards with the old model, but I routinely hit the flag from 350 and in with no problem in Pinseeker mode.     Why might you want to hit the flag from 300+ yards?  Simple, to calculate a layup yardage.    Now, the big comparison of lasers is with GPS units.  In my experience, GPS just doesn't have the accuracy.  Sometimes GPS is dead nuts on, other times it's off by 7 or 8 yards.  The problem is, you don't know when it's off.  Add to that not being able to calculate right to the pin, and you might as well just figure distance by the yardage markers on the course.    Some have mentioned batteries in this unit.  I've played 80+ rounds this year, in addition to using it occasionally at the driving range, and I've gone through 4 batteries.  It's expensive if you buy your batteries at the drug store, costing $8+ each, but just search for the CR2 battery here on Amazon.  I bought 10 in bulk for [...] last year (with shipping).  I just searched a few minutes ago and found a 2 pack for [...].

B001VNB54A|3.0|Having read both \\"Helmet for my Pillow\\", and \\"With the Old Breed\\", I have been looking forward to \\"The Pacific\\" for a long time. I wanted very much to like this miniseries, but it did not quite deliver. And to preface this review, I want to say that contrary to some, I believe that comparisons of \\"The Pacific\\" to \\"Band of Brothers\\" are not only inevitable, but valid. One is a companion to the other, made by the same people, about the same war.     My main complaint about \\"The Pacific\\" is the lack of depth of both the story and the characters. This, in comparison to \\"Band of Brothers\\" in which both characters and story had great depth. \\"The Pacific\\" attempts to weave three different stories into one (this also affects the cohesiveness of the story). Although I had no problem separating the three main characters, many of the others just blend together, one not much different than the other (\\"Snafu\\" being the one exception). I think the series would have been better served if the John Basilone story had been dropped, and that time spent giving more depth to the stories of Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie.      Another problem for me is that two episodes are given to stories surrounding the relationship with the women that two of the characters (Leckie and Basilone) are involved with. Many war stories include love stories, and sometimes it works. In this series I don't think that it did.    And finally, if you are looking for acting performances of the quality given by Damien Lewis, Ron Livingston, and others in \\"Band of Brothers\\", I think you will be disappointed. The characters in \\"Band of Brothers\\" were natural and believable in their roles. In my opinion, this is not always the case in \\"The Pacific\\".    On the plus side, most of the combat sequences are incredible. They were done as well as any in \\"Band of Brothers\\". Also, the reproduction of the terrain that the battles were fought on is excellent. Kudos for both those things. Some of the small detail is very impressive. There are things that only veterans of the period, or experts, would pick up on. I saw that some characters were wearing I.D. bracelets on their wrists like the ones unique to the Marines of that period. The only way I know this is because my father's lies in a box in my desk drawer. How many others will notice? Detail like that, must be applauded, and there was a lot of that in \\"The Pacific\\".    Bottom line for me was that there was a certain lack of depth and cohesiveness in both the story, and the characters. This was a disappointment. Although you might find buying the DVDs worthwhile for the battle scenes alone, my advice would be to read \\"Helmet for my Pillow\\" and \\"With the Old Breed\\" to really get the stories in depth.
B001R60ESE|5.0|This is a wonderful jazz concert by Chris Botti and the Boston Pops.  I'm amazed at how they were able to line up such an impressive list of guest performers, including Sting, Josh Groban, Yo-Yo Ma, John Mayer, Katharine McPhee, and Steven Tyler (among others).  For me Katharine McPhee's rendition of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" and Steven Tyler's \\"Cryin'\\" were worth the price of the DVD alone.  Everything else is a bonus.  As far as technicals, the sound and picture are both fantastic.  I would highly recommend this concert for any jazz and pop music fan.
B001VNB54A|2.0|I just finished seeing the entire 10 hours of the Pacific over the last few days and realized that the deterioration in the story is purposely done by the Producers of the film to show that atrocities that war drives people to commit and how humans are reduced to animals after being in combat for some time.  The first 2 hours are good and try to balance the reality of battle with the purpose of it and even focus on the first winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor in the Pacific.  After the first two hours though, this film is not worth watching unless you enjoy seeing endless blood and body parts with no scenes of valor that redeem those who are fighting.  I would recommend watching the first two hours only and definitely skipping the rest of the 10 hours due to the constant depravity that is emphasized during the rest of the film.  In the end, the Producers of the film are just anti war and want to use the Pacific to further their anti war agenda at the cost of harming the image and memory of the marines who fought and died or were wounded in the Pacific.  In other words, more Marine misconduct and atrocities are shown that scenes of courage and valor.

1881273873|4.0|Love is the universal language for the world. Everyone can speak it and everyone can understand it. Love is honestly what makes the world go round. Everyone needs to feel loved in order to feel complete and whole. Even though love is such a universal concept, everyone differs in how they understand, feel or express love.    Gary Chapman writes a book The Five Love Languages which purpose is to help those to read it understand exactly what their love language is and how to understand or \\"speak\\" other peoples love language.     Chapman writes about the concept of your love tank being full or empty. The love tank represents how well we are feeling loved and if we are feeling happy. You want your love tank to be full rather than empty because this means that our dominant love language is being spoken to us through those we care about and satisfying our need and natural desire for love.     According to Dr. Chapman there are five different languages of love:    Words of Affirmation  Acts of Service  Gifts  Quality Time  Physical Touch    Lots of people tend to \\"speak\\"or \\"hear\\"more than one of these five love languages. Even though some people think that they all apply to them, there is usually a dominant love language or two that speaks most profoundly to you. Chapman explains that the love language that you most likely need to feel for yourself is usually the one you more prominently speak to others.     To the readers benefit there is a handy quiz in the back of the book that helps you best determine which love language best fits what you need or what you need to give to others. I suggest actually reading the book as well instead of just simply taking the quiz      because, Dr. Chapman really does teach ways to better understand those you love and have those you love understand you through his five languages.     I highly suggest reading this book even if you do not feel the need to have some serious relationship in your life. The theory of this book applies to so many different relationships in human life, not just romantic relationships.     Everyone can gain a lot and learn how to better understand those who they associate with if they can simply understand the meaning of love for others, and what personal love they need to feel.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|There appear to be two kinds of people in today's filmgoing public: those, like me, who regard AVATAR as a pinnacle of SF cinema, and those who find fault with it, and I confess to being utterly puzzled about their carping. Clunky dialogue? Well, I thought it perfectly workable and, at times, brilliant, and I've been writing my own SF and opinion re the same for several decades now. The overly familiar plot? It seemed utterly fresh and beautifully structured to me. Yes, it has historical analogues, but that is true of many, many excellent films.     I have been a devotee of SF all my life, and I'm in my seventies. Notice I do not call AVATAR \\"the pinnacle,\\" but one of them. To my mind the list must begin with \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" (NOT THE REMAKE), and include CE3K, the 1st Star Wars trilogy, and some, though not all, of the Star Treks. But James Cameron has created a myth of enormous power wedded to stunning technology that so engaged me intellectually and emotionally that I had to remind myself on each rescreening to wear my contact lenses, because my glasses always got streaked by tears.    I sympathize with those who do not wish to purchase a 2D extended set because they expect a 3D version eventually will be issued. They are probably correct, but let me offer two observations. First, I saw AVATAR many times, and once, inadvertently, I took a friend to the 2D \\"flat\\" version (I didn't know it existed as such). Actually, it worked quite well; little was lost, though I would not have believed what I am saying if I had not seen it for myself. Second, 3D DVDs, in my experience, don't work all that well on TV sets. For example, \\"Coraline,\\" which I loved in the theatre, was a visual mess in its 3D version; better to watch it flat.    AVATAR Special Edition is a must for me; if it ever does come out in 3D, I may buy it, but I fully expect it to disappoint on home video.

1599218011|5.0|We all know we need to eat more veggies and less junky foods, but do we really understand why? As a dietitian, this is the first book I've seen that gets down to the nitty gritty on why green foods are so important in boosting your immune system, how and why certain foods affect the acidity/alkalinity of your blood, and why any of that matters in an entertaining, can't-put-the-book-down kind of way. It is fascinating, empowering, and highly motivating. Since reading this book, my husband, myself, and our 3 kids (all under age 5) have added a scrumptious daily green smoothie to our already healthy diets, and are now feeling more energized, more focused, and running circles around all our cold and flu-bugged friends. This book not only includes essential health information, but tons of practical nutrition and lifestyle recommendations as well. There are delicious recipes, and 21 sample days to guide you on the right foot. Following the principles discussed in this book is the best gift you can give yourself and your loved ones. Kris Carr is living proof that this plan is the best way to live. You will thank her!

0061433047|4.0|I've missed Pratchett's books. It's been way too long since I've last read one. He's one of my favorite authors and one I think more people should read. So if you aren't reading him already, go grab one of his books. If this series sounds intriguing, start with The Wee Free Men. Also, Harper's actually reprinted the first two books together as The Wee Free Men: The Beginning, so you can check that out too.     I love this series and just Pratchett's writing in general. The characters are always fully realized that they feel like old friends even from the beginning, the humor is spot-on and makes me laugh out loud, and some scenes just make you think about the world around you and how you look at things. His prose just flows so easily and half the book is over with before you know it.     I also love how he does his witches. They aren't your usual witches with spells and magical powers. They're more organic, in a sense- they just know things most people don't, help out the people in their village, are usually very clever, and they do occasionally fight evil, but not necessarily with spells and potions. It's just such a refreshing and original take on witches. And Tiffany is such a great role model and protagonist- strong, clever, and just all-around awesome.    My favorite characters of these books though are the Nac Mac Feegle (the blue people you see on the cover). They are HILARIOUS and I'm always cracking up whenever they're in the scene. They're just such great characters.    There were times though that some scenes felt like deja vu, like I'd seen them before, and that bothered me a bit because I could see where something was going and ended up being right (I'm usually horrible at this, so when I can actually do it, it's a big deal). But overall, it's still a really good book and a fitting conclusion to the series. I really enjoyed it and now need to find time to fit more Pratchett books into my reading schedule!
0399156577|3.0|I purchased the \\"The Search\\" in audio so I would have something to listen to during a long trip.  The reader was excellent and the plot of the story, training dogs to search for lost victims, was interesting but overdone.  I was surprised that after all of the information given to the reader regarding \\"search and find\\" techniques that the author overlooked a bit of basic (important) information regarding a dog's health.  Anyone who has owned a dog knows of a problem called \\"chocolate toxicity\\" and when given chocolate, depending on the kind and amount of the chocolate, it can actually kill the dog.  One of the treats mentioned to reward the dogs in \\"The Search\\" was brownies.  When the story line came up with that I wondered if Nora Roberts knew about \\"dog toxicity?\\"  Most brownies are made of chocolate which is toxic to dogs.  The oversight was not enough to ruin the book for me but I thought it strange and wondered how many people might get the idea to give their dog \\"brownies\\" without knowing that the treat could be fatal to their pet.
B00004U2GI|5.0|This is must have essential  Johnny Cash! As great as \\"Live At Folsom\\" is I think I actually prefer this one a little more. This is as good as a live album could possibly ever be. Johnny Cash is just on fire singing these songs and just so much energy from him and the 1000 prisoners in the audience. From the very first song \\"Big River\\" you can tell you are listening to something special and then he just cranks it up another notch with \\"Wreck Of The Old 97\\". Getting to hear Cash talk to the prisoners is quite a bonus, some funny stuff as well.  This album really captures what a great artist and live performer Johnny Cash was. You also get the song \\"San Quentin\\" twice because the prisoners love the song and are yelling for him to sing it again. Great song by the way and contains the lyrics \\"San Quentin may you rot and burn in hell\\".  Then you get his best version of the classic \\"A Boy Named Sue\\" and a good live version of \\"Ring Of Fire\\" and also \\"I Walk The Line\\" was really good.. To see this show live must have just been unreal and  I'm listening to it as I'm writing this review and it's honestly giving me chills. We are so lucky that this show was recorded.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|this is a rarity among albums... one that you can listen to it in its entirity... not a bad track on the album. But this is  the norm with EVERY Kings of Leon Cd.  My favorite on the album are Manhattan, Cold Desert and Seventeen. Five Stars!! would guive more if I could!!
B003KNDMXG|5.0|I read a review for this album it was a glowing review so i took a chance on it. Id never heard of janelle monae before but the reviewer of this paticular album is usually spot on with his thoughts and comments, i bought the cd of this already but i am a collector of vinyl records and had to own it on vinyl aswell. If you like your music to be experimental,retro and new at the same time this is for you. So many artists come to mind  kate bush, prince, david bowie, outkast (all at their creative best ). I could go on with comparisons, influences etc. Its a mix of funk, hip hop, soul, electronic, jazz , cabaret, otherworldly dreamy ballads so much is on here. Janelle monae is light years ahead of so many dull, bland and formulaic artists around today. Give this album afew listens as it gets better each time, usually great albums require repeated listens.  I highly recommend this album and i cant wait to hear her previous ep which i should be receiving soon. By the way this is totally changing the subject but robyn is one of the best pop stars around today ( along with kylie minogue, but shes always been great ) Body talk part 1 and 2 i also highly recommend.

So there's at least two more releases down the road...the theatrical release (NOW IN 3D!!!!)...and another director's cut (NOW IN 3D!!!!)...the Cameron marketing machine is targeting the suckers, don't fall for it.
0385523386|4.0|Piper Kerman was a college-educated, successful professional when a ten-year-old charge of money-laundering related to a drug smuggling ring came back to haunt her.  She was sentenced to 15 months in a federal prison, of which she served 13 before being released for good behavior.    Danbury Federal Correctional Institute in Connecticut is a minimum-security facility for women, so it wasn't really all that bad.  Piper didn't experience any of the horrors we hear about, such as beatings, rape, etc.  In fact, except for not being allowed to leave, it was almost like living in a dorm under unusually poor conditions:  bad food, the \\"room\\" was a cubicle with only a partial wall, the bathroom wasn't clean and rarely had hot water, inspections were frequent, and there was no real privacy.    However, Piper experienced what conditions were like in other prisons when she was flown to another state to testify as a witness in the trial of a co-defendant.    Martha Stewart was an interesting sub-theme in this book.   She was a frequent topic of conversation among the prisoners, as she had requested to be incarcerated at Danbury.  The prison didn't want the media attention that would come with a celebrity inmate, so they closed the prison to new inmates.  This meant that the prison emptied out significantly (due to the constant outflow of inmates who had completed their sentences) and it temporarily become \\"luxuriously\\" quiet and uncrowded.    Since this is a low-security facility, the prisoners were in for mostly non-violent, often white-collar crimes, which made for a far wider range of types that you'd normally expect to find in jail.  The inmate population encompassed all the races and included stockbrokers, elderly women, a nun (in for her peace activism), and a male-to-female transsexual.  Piper made some close friends there, and her descriptions of her fellow prisoners are one of the highlights of the book.    This book makes it easy to understand why so many convicts become institutionalized and return again and again for new crimes, especially in a relatively comfortable facility such as Danbury.  Some of the inmates faced much worse conditions once they were released, and dreaded it.  In jail, they were guaranteed a roof over their heads, a bed, a job, the company of friends, and three meals a day.  Once out, they would be homeless, jobless, and broke.  Some had no one on the outside, especially those who were in for long terms.    Kerman has a real gift for observation, and it is the details that make this book so interesting.  The reader can imagine everything so clearly, it is almost like being there.  She is honest about her flaws and her crime, and seems sincerely repentant.  In prison, for the first time in her life, she saw first-hand the effects of the kinds of drugs that her co-defendants smuggled.     (298 pages)
0811876373|5.0|This book is a blast!! I had so much fun making these treats!!1 Huge kudos to \\"Bakerella\\" for breaking it down and making it super easy for anyone to make cake pops and without a bunch of special equipment! I took a plate-load of cake pops to an event and they were a huge hit. Once I got going, I could see how I could use so many things to decorate cake pops for just about any occasion. You don't have to be a baking expert to make these!
0375842209|5.0|I am an avid reader who is always looking for great books.  My sister told me to read this one and I wasn't disappointed!  The first few pages were hard for me to grasp...the writing style is very different, but I'm glad I stuck with it to the end.  I work full time and am a single Mom, but I found a way to read it in three days....I just couldn't put it down! I would highly recommend it!

A woman comes to spend time alone at a lakeside hotel. From this still point, the plot expands like ripples in a pool. The writing is always exquisite and clear.

B000SEFCD8|5.0|If you have read any of Patricia's other books and enjoyed them you will enjoy this book.     I have owned dogs for a long time and have seen dog training change dramatically over the last 20 years. This clearly is written by an author who has a positive training method and understands dogs very well. That said some of the \\"pie in the sky training\\" that is being promoted by so many of the positive dog trainers works well only with softer dogs with relatively compliant personalities. Even though Patricia is probably most associated with this positive dog training it's clear that she understands that there must be structure and discipline in a positive relationship between humans and dogs.    There is a little bit of repetition between stories from other things that the author has written. That said I am always a sucker for a good story about her beloved dog Luke. This is an excellent book. That said if you only were going to buy one dog training book this would not be the ultimate choice, but to round out a good library of books this would be an excellent choice.    My compliments for having text-to-speech enabled on the Kindle edition. I've been critical of other authors or publishers that have this option disabled and I believe that books that have this feature enabled should be commended.
B001EO748M|5.0|I highly recommend each season of the Tudors.  Rather than to write the same things over again, after reading the other reviews here, i will just say that if you love \\"history\\", you'll love this series.  I had to buy all of them for myself and now i've had to go and buy a couple more to give as gifts.  This is a hit all the way around. Great acting, scenery is awesome! I love anything Tudor!!
0385533829|3.0|Just this side of boring. Maybe when you are such a big name author as Dan Brown is, people are more likely to be a \\"yes\\" person than when you are just starting out. Maybe Brown gets paid by the page and therefore over inflating the length is to his benefit (not his readers).  Whatever the reason, I kept wanting to scream \\"get on with it\\" while enduring more repeative passages.  The story line was quite good, facts interesting enough without all the padding. Lack of editing made this book a true beating to get through.
B0041CGP02|1.0|as many other \\"hard rock\\", \\"glam metal\\" bands from the 80's, try to live from earlier hits to keep them on our minds.    I started to be a Bon Jovi fan when I was about 12, New Jersey was the album, and I have to say that I became an instant fan, so I went to their earlier stuff and I absolutely loved it.    But then the 90's began and here comes trouble..., they changed their style in order to keep the band commercial, and somehow we can say they succeeded, and I can even say that the 90's Bon Jovi had my respect.    But this past decade has been terrible, Crush was a decent album, but then everything started to fall apart, and the only decent work after that was Have a nice day.    And now this..., another Greatest hits compilation, after Crossroad from '94, One wild night (Live album with all the hits), This left feels right (Greatest hits with new versions), and now this crap.    Do we really need so many Best of, greatest hits crap?, I don't think so, if the band isn't inspired enough to release a new album then put together an EP and release it as that, but don't sell us this crap that only makes true fans mad.    I really don't recommend buying this only for the 4 \\"new\\" songs, the rest of the material if you are a true fan you already have it, so what's the point?    The only thing I'm looking forward to (and hope they will some day) is for a dvd with the collection of ALL the videos, the Crossroad home video didn't have all of them at that point, but that's it.    Even if they come up with a new album, probably it will suck, just like the Circle did, it's obvious that for Jon this has became nothing but a company to make money, the funny thing is that he criticize so much the music industry today, and he is exactly what made it what it is.    Sorry Jon but you are taking advantage from your fans and eventually you will loose us if you keep on doing this stuff.
B00447G2T8|5.0|\\"7 Sinners\\" is the 13th studio album by power metal innovators \\"Helloween\\", a follow up to \\"Gambling with the devil\\"(2007). Conceptually \\"7 Sinners\\" is probably one of the darkest albums \\"Helloween\\" has recorded, and a highly acclaimed release already by the press.<br /><br />The darker approach is mainly traceable on the lyrics and the particularly heavy riffing throughout the album, yet \\"7 Sinners\\" is so much more: To begin with, the album demonstrates perfect balance between riffs and melodies, fast and slow tempos, aggressive and catchy vocals. The line up features founders \\"Michael Weikath (g) Markus Grosskpof (b) established lead singer Andi Deris and the newer members Sascha Gerstner (g) and Dani Loble (d). \\"7 Sinners\\" is the third album recorded by the particular line up, and it very much seems that every fell into place with this album.<br /><br />Yes, you could attribute the freshness of the new album to the darker concept that surrounds it, yet its artistic success probably comes down to the bonding and accumulated experience of this line up: First and foremost Dani's drum performance is totally superior to the previous two albums-the guy plays faster with more aggressive and passion that almost establishes his personal style. For that matter the drumming on this album is totally devastating and as a result fuels the overall performance with adrenaline. Sasha on the other hand has managed to collaborate perfectly with Weikath resulting in twin guitar melodies coming out in loads (in fact the album has probably more twin guitar melodies and lengthier solos than any of the previous two albums). Favorite tracks include:\\"Who is mr. madman\\", \\"World of fantasy\\", \\"Long live the king\\", \\"You stupid mankind\\" and \\"My sacrifice\\".<br /><br />So the musical height of \\"7 Sinners\\" is not simply due to the dark conceptual direction but thanks to the strengthening of this line up. One can theorize that the past five years of stage performance, recording and socializing, have finally come to fruition for this line up and \\"7 Sinners\\" is the outcome of this process which the listener can't escape but enjoy.<br /><br />Whether it is comparable to their classic albums, one can not say, still \\"7 Sinners\\" has the perfect analogy of heaviness, melody and speed, therefore rightfully considered a flawless power metal album in 2010.<br /><br />\\"Metal Hammer\\" Greek magazine (issue 310) marks this album with 8/10 commenting: \\"This album will satisfy many and overwhelm most.\\"o fruition for this line up and \\"7 Sinners\\" is the outcome of this process which the listener can't escape but enjoy.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|Rented this before buying it to make sure my girls (2 & 5) liked it...WOW. I did not expect to cry!  This movie is so great and with such a touching ending, I don't even think I could explain it without giving the ending away.  There was some language that I had to explain to my daughters that while they aren't dirty words, they are words I do not expect to come out of their mouths; words such as IDIOT, MORON, and DUMMY.  Those words are not said in our home and I don't think they were necessary to ad to this movie, however, now-a-days, its pretty hard to find a good family movie without curse words, so I let it slide.  There were also some dark, scary parts to the movie where some other kids I know who watched it were crying and terrified...knowing this ahead of time I did tell my children to please remember its just a movie and cartoons always end happy, so don't be scared. Neither were.    The last 10 minutes of the movie, make the entire movie worth watching over and over.  Hit me on so many levels, that the 5 times we watched it before sending it back, I cried each and every time.    My two year old was very mad at me for returning the movie (had to, it was rented!) so I told Santa that they really wanted it and I\\"m sure they won't be disappointed come Christmas morning.    A must have if you or your child is a Toy Story Fan.  This one was our favorite.

B003KUSUG8|4.0|I admit I fell of the Eminem (Now Marshall Mathers once again) bandwagon in the early 2000's due to his severe hatred for woman (since I am a woman) However I heard this album had some substance to it and so I thought I would give it a try. I was impressed with how real his lyrics were. He painted a picture of a depressed drug addicted man who knew it was time to choose life and living over feeding his pain with pills and alcohol. There are as usual a few tracks talking his usual trash but in all honesty a few songs brought tears to my eyes cause of the pain he seems to be suffering and how he has found strength in his own self.<br /><br />EXCELLENT ALBUM!
B0009S3HI0|4.0|The track \\"Crenshaw Punch\\" is awesome, and the cover of \\"The Chauffeur\\" (Duran Duran) is great. \\"Wax and Wane\\" (Cocteau Twins) is good also. \\"Black Moon\\" with B-Real is pretty cool. I'm a huge Deftones fan, but I think the acoustic tracks suck. But the remaining cover songs are decent.
B002K0WBXW|2.0|The seller did a great job in packaging the product well and getting it to me quickly.  Apon opening the dvd case, I found the dvd to be in excellent condition as stated by the seller.  However, 3/4 of the way through the movie, it froze. Was able to skip to the next chapter but  had I not seen the movie before, I would have not known what I missed. I paid less than $2.00  for the movie so as the saying goes, you get what you paid for.

B0000VCZKW|1.0|I bought this movie thinking it would be a wonderful diversion for my 7 year old daughter who was home from school sick.  It is going in the trash.  I have never seen a darker, grimmer story aimed at children.  The parents are despicable people who, let's call it what is is, not only emotionally and psychologically abuse Matilda but leave her alone in the house on a daily basis to fend for herself at AGE FOUR.  Then she gets sent to a school where the principal literally throws children out windows and swings a child by her pigtails and sails her over the schoolyard fence.  The fact that Matilda perseveres enough to carry around her adoption papers herself (for her parents to sign and give her up) is stunning for her but not the sort of thing I want my child to be left with after watching a movie marketed for children.  I literally wanted to turn the thing off about 15 minutes into it but my daughter begged to see the whole thing and I kept thinking SOMETHING is going to redeem this movie.  Alas, it was bad to the end.  It's gone from my household.
B003UERZ88|3.0|Love Rob in all his genres, and have been a Priest fan since Stained Class (Beyond the Realms...is still my #1 JP song), and appreciate his musical diversity, even some of Nostradamous and Two stuff.    Was really looking forward to this album, as the first two were superb (Crucible is one of the all-time under-rated albums), and then Winter Songs came out, which I was prepared to accept as a Christmas one-off, so thought he'd been saving all the non Priest really rockin' stuff for Halford IV    But....IV is a mixed bag, which won't appeal to the Metal God's heavy following.  I like the album, it shows Rob in his full diversity and range of songs, and lyric content. Musically it is excellent.    However, following the first 2, is it a fitting 3 rd album for the Metal god ? I think not.  Release this as his solo musical coup d'etat, but not as Halford - the JP sucessor.    Sorry mixed reivew. Lov ethe album, but very disappinting as a halford metal god release
B003Z2LAAO|4.0|I thought this video was pretty good.  To tell you the truth, I'm not bowled over by the 3d movement yet.  I have an excellent TV set and blue ray player and glasses.

B004132HZS|5.0|After Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movie I was quite frankly getting sick of the Sherlock Holmes character and all of his incarnations (i.e. 'House' and any major CSI character). Now I don't like to be gushy over anything but not only have Doctor Who's Stephan Moffat and Mark Gatiss faithfully updated the Conan-Doyle characters to a fresh, modern day setting, BBC's Sherlock is by far the best TV series I've seen all year!<br /><br />The show Sherlock (as I mentioned) updates the characters of Sherlock Holmes, Dr. John Watson, and Inspector Lestrade to a modern day London setting. This transition actually works better than I thought it would: Sherlock uses texting and computers to his advantage, Watson Blogs his stories but still WAS in the current Afghanistan conflict, they both use credit cards to pay for things etc. But aside from the technology the episodes play out in a very faithful and thrilling manner taking Sherlock and John (they're on a first name basis) all over England using Sherlock's deductive reasoning to solve complex and bizarre crimes. What's even better is all of the original characterizations are intact making Sherlock and John a fun duo who argue while trying to figure each other out.<br /><br />The characters of course wouldn't work as well as if the actor didn't do such an exceptional job. Benedict Cumberbatch is immediatly acceptable as Holmes, and while probably won't make you forget Jeremy Brett or Basil Rathbone he's 100 percent believable and convincing as this modern man who despite his brilliant mind has a hard time understanding people. Martin Freeman is superb as John Watson, portraying someone haunted by his war injuries but sticking to his human principals and provides an empathetic personality to Holmes' sometimes cold methods. Rupert Graves is excellently cast as Inspector Lestrade, a dedicated cop who, despite his better judgment is willing to let Sherlock into an investigation if it means saving lives.<br /><br />If there's one low point to this DVD set it's that the three 90 minute episodes included behave more like a trilogy of films than a TV series. The overarching plot is an exciting one but the middle episode 'The Blind Banker' feels like it takes a back seat to the first and final episodes. It's a solid episode and worth seeing, but just doesn't have the overarching energy of the other two.<br /><br />The DVD set also includes a making-of, the original 60 minute 'Study in Pink' pilot and commentaries on the first and last episodes.<br /><br />Like I said, Sherlock is easily my favorite show of 2010. It's got great characters, cunning mysteries, and thrilling action and chase scenes.

B0021L8V0M|4.0|When a story is written about a double agent, a mole or a sleeper agent, any number of cards can play. As a result, the suspence and tension levels immediately go up qute a few notches.<br /><br />This movie is about Evelyn Salt (Jolie); and to a much lesser extent her husband, who is German and studies spiders.<br /><br />The story starts 2 years ago in Korea where Salt is being tortured, from there it is fast forwarded to where she meets a soviet agent, who is trying to activate her.<br /><br />Apparently, Salt's father was a powerful wrestler and her mother a chessmaster. Hence she has inherited her fighting skills and strategic capabilities from them.<br /><br />In this film, Salt is more resourceful than MacGyver, can escape lockdowns better than David Copperfield and can jump moving vehicles better than Morpheus (in Matrix 2). That being said, you can expect to be treated to a lot of high speed chases, gut wrenching escapes, and several tight plot twists.<br /><br />This film is guaranteed to have you riveted to your seat from start to finish. Enjoy!

0525951652|5.0|Yeah, I get it, the Kindle price is too high.  Complain to Amazon.  Don't rate the book down.<br /><br />I actually read this book.  I love when Ken Follett writes this style of book (Pillars of the Earth, World Without End, Night Over Water, A Place Called Freedom, etc.) where there are multiple groups of people from different classes/geographies who are somehow intertwined and you follow them over time.  My very favorite Ken Follett book and the one that got me reading his things was Pillars of the Earth and I would put this book on par with that one.  That is saying a lot.<br /><br />The story follows five groups of people from different countries (Whales, Britan, USA, Germany, and Russia) through the events leading up to, during, and after World War I.  The character development was amazing and I found myself loving these people and caring about what happened to them and their happiness.  In a way feeling like this, when many times the people were battling each other, made the book even better.  I couldn't pick sides during the war.  There were innocent people I cared about who didn't agree with the war being forced to fight on all sides.  It put everything into the perspective.<br /><br />As usual, the writing was great, the stories of the differnt people were great, and I am eagerly awaiting the next book.
B00338QENI|5.0|What an amazing book, and what an amazing story!  Rebecca Skloot takes on a very complicated issue - what should - or does - happen to our bodies or tissue after we're done with it - and who gets to make that decision - and gives us a well-written, well-paced book looking not only at the issue itself, but the people involved in and most directly impacted by one spectacular case.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks was a poor black woman who had a terribly hard life. She died young, from cancer, and after her death, tissue that had been taken during her treatment was first to be found to grow continually, which opened the door for medical discoveries and advances that benefit millions every day. They also helped make some people along the way quite rich - though none of them were members of her family.<br /><br />The book interweaves two stories: The first is that of Lacks and her family. Skloot spoke to several of Henrietta's family and friends, helping us get to know them better and see the world - and what happened with Henrietta - though their eyes. The other story is about the HeLa (named from the first two letters of Henrietta's first and last names) cell line - how it was discovered and what that discovery meant both to science and to mankind as a whole.<br /><br />The heart of the story, though, is Henrietta's adult daughter, Deborah Lacks, who, sadly, passed away shortly before the book was published. Deborah - as seen through Skloot's eyes - is the kind of almost larger-than-life personality that would be hard to invent for a story. She's obviously intelligent, yet because she had so little education there are times when things most of us would just assume are common sense confuse her completely (and sometimes, quite frankly, I think her views might be more on the mark than the conventional wisdom!) She's a proud - in the good sense - and tenacious woman who can be as excitable as a kid on Christmas, a fierce protector of those she loves, terrified of things she doesn't understand, and eager to learn as much as she can. Through Deborah's we learn what it was like to grow up poor - extremely poor - and black during the civil rights era, and some of what it was like before then, when open discrimination was acceptable.<br /><br />When it comes to the scientific story, Skloot does a very good job of elevating this from being just another tale about big business exploiting the poor and uneducated by giving us a glimpse of the humanity in the scientists who discovered what was special about Henrietta's cells and worked to use them to create medical marvels. She also explores some of the legal issues that exist even today which strip from us some of our ability to determine what happens to our tissue after it's taken from our bodies. Skloot's ability to balance events, motivations and the effect of how \\"that's just how things were done back then\\" shows a delicate touch, but she's not afraid to lay blame where it needs to be laid.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a great \\"human-interest\\" story, a story about the triumph of the human spirit, medical history, the history of the black experience in America, or those who are just curious and want a really, really good non-fiction book to read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will likely re-read it at some point. It's definitely one that will stay with you.ager to learn as much as she can.

B00026WU82|1.0|Thought I'd give it a try because it is listed as one of the all time great albums.  Tried reading the liner notes on the CD and the words made no sense at all.  Listened to the CD and kept hoping it would get better and it didn't.  Trying to understand his songs was a waste of time for me because what he was saying was either way over my head or it just didn't make any sense. I'll keep plugging along trying some other artists.  I will not ever buy another Bob Dylan CD.  I think he must have been high when he wrote these songs.
1439181780|1.0|I could not get past the first CD of The Power. It is one of the most irritating, repetitive, \\"all fluff and no substance\\" things I've ever heard. It's written for simpletons. Not until 50 minutes into it did a new thought beyond the standard, \\"good thoughts and feelings bring good things,\\" and \\"bad thoughts and feeling bring bad things.\\" Repeated over and over with little variation.<br /><br />Not only that, SOMEONE - the publisher, the editor, the engineer, her friends - should have told Rhonda that she should not be narrating her own book. Her voice is grating, there are about two basic inflections she can pull off, so almost every sentence sounds the same. Actually, it sounds like she's reading a children's book, and not that well, either. Sorry, Rhonda...hire some professionals. Spend the money. Get off your ego trip.  The more I listened, the more bad feelings I got.<br /><br />And the quotes? It's interesting that she dug up many of the quotes from relatively obscure New Thought thinkers...where is Thomas Troward? Emma Curtis Hopkins? Charles Fillmore? Ernest Holmes? Catherine Ponder? Napoleon Hill? Florence Schovel Shinn?  Edgar Cayce?  the whole philosophy of New Thought was laid out in the late 1800's and early 1900's. I don't know from what pool she pulled these quotes. I liked a lot of them, but they were from people I never heard of, mostly, and since no background information was offered about the authors, they pulled much less weight than they could have.<br /><br />Granted, I have not had the heart or the patience to listen to discs 2-5. I'm really wishing I hadn't spent any money on this at all. With \\"The Power\\" Rhonda is merely capitalizing on the success of The Secret and this time it's one lousy sequel that is going to seriously backfire on her. There are plenty of other sources to get this type of thinking, with more substance to it (let's not spend all our Universal energy manifesting a skirt, okay? why not solve bigger problems?) and then I won't have to listen to her drone on for close to 6 hours.<br /><br />Rhonda, let me tell you one of the secrets: you're just not a narrator, hon. Nor an author, really. You can only go so far with this, because you keep trying to reduce the principles to something too sparse, simplistic, surface and materialistic.<br /><br />It is true that the power of emotions must be brought into alignment, and that they are the fuel for manifestation. It is true that love is the most powerful positive emotion and hate is the worst. This is nothing new! In fact, many of the books and tapes created since The Secret that are based on \\"filling in the blanks in The Secret\\" have already mentioned this fact. Were you thinking you had to justify yourself, or were you just hopping on the bandwagon? Oh, I see, you're adding to all the other books you've written since The Secret. Probably equally as padded and fluffy. Haven't you made enough money yet? We appreciate that you want to change the world, but...no thanks.<br /><br />You guys want to learn a practical way to integrate and apply these principles? Go to a Science of Mind or Unity Church. Find a \\"Center for Spiritual Living\\" and take their classes. Ernest Holmes (SOM founder) and Charles Fillmore (Unity founder) had this figured out a hundred years ago, and developed workable, reasonable systems for applying it.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Excellent collection of the most excellent show ever to appear on television, plus some awesome accessories.    The quality of the picture on blu-ray is, for the most part, superb, however there are a few rare low light shots that look a bit fuzzy.    Myonly real complaints are that the rules for the Senet game are hidden on a hidden menu in a hidden disk hidden in a hidden compartment in the box (which might, itself be hidden as well, if your into that) and aren't provided in writing inside the box, and that some of the discs contain 5 episodes each despite the accompanying booklet listing all disks as containing four episodes.

006112429X|4.0|THis is a fast read and well written. A horrifying story and it has some amazing twists. The author knows what she is doing. BUT I would bet my bottom dollar the author is not a mother. She writes about her baby as though she never loves him. Ever. He screams all the time and even at seven months he apparently stops only when the father gets home to make the mother look bad. First of all as a mother of five kids I know that moms love their screamers even when the moms are driven mad. Yes, post partum depression can create bad feelings but this character NEVER loves the boy and she does not know what a seven month old is like. They certainly are not calculating. Then inexplicably at the end, this crazy sociopath son gets some redeeming qualities. So I don't buy the premise even though I finished the book with pleasure.

044654759X|3.0|Let me start by saying that I love Nicholas Sparks, I think he is a very good writer especially for women. That being said I think the last few of his books have been of the same recipe or the same flavor, and yes I did get the feeling that I had read or saw this before.<br />Having been in a situation similar to this one, I must say that no one came into my life like the hero in this book. In each of his books there is always someone there to save the woman, while its ok in a book it rarely happens in real life. Anyway, if you have nothing to read pick it up, borrow it from a friend or the library if you can. The kindle price I thought was a bit high but I bought it anyway.
B000002GYR|5.0|Has there ever been a more beautiful love song than I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You or a more poignant exposition of unrequited and lost love than Martha?  Has there ever been a songwriter that marries words and melody to quite such devastating, late night, drunk at the bar, pondering life's vicissitudes as Tom Waits. If there ever has, I have not heard of him or her. This is a magnificent collection that, nearly 40 years later, sounds as good today as it did then. If you ever wondered what all the fuss was about when people extolled the virtues of Waits, buy this album and discover for yourself.
B001VNB54A|4.0|It's very tempting to compare The Pacific to the Band of Brothers, the HBO WWII miniseries that preceded it by several years. And in that comparison, I'm afraid The Pacific falls short. It is less cohesive. Viewers may find themselves less invested in the characters. And there's no way around it -- The Pacific is very, very bleak and dark. To say that it's antiwar, though, or that it portrays Marines in a negative light is too simple, not to mention too naive.    It's no secret that, post-Vietnam, war films have been darker, bleaker, and more morally ambiguous. Despite that, Band of Brothers was still fairly conventional. Yes, it was rough, but the guys were still heroes watching out for each other and fighting for their country. The point of The Pacific seems to be that war is pure hell, especially on these barren, rainy, muddy Pacific islands littered with bodies and debris. If Band of Brothers was about brotherhood and honor, The Pacific is about survival. It seems to ask, \\"how do you survive something like war on Guadalcanal or Iwo Jima, not just physically but mentally?\\" And, it turns out, that was incredibly difficult to do. Yes, there is some explicit sex and violence. If you want a feel-good war hero movie, look elsewhere. If you want a realistic but sympathetic portrayal of men fighting in the most horrible conditions imaginable, watch The Pacific.     It's not something you pop in the DVD player or Blu-ray player for a fun, easy watch. It's something that you let sink into your heart and mind. You let it teach you lessons about the depths and heights of human possibility.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|After 40 years, the World at War is still the best, most comprehensive documentary series every produced.  The interviews with the highest ranking participants in the war is incredible as it is.  Coupled with these rare interviews is hourse of vintage, war-time footage, which comprehenisively covers the 2nd World War in its entirety.      The only area this series is lacking, if I can even call it lacking, is that while it covers the entire war, proportionatly, much more time is dedicated to the war in Europe, as opposed to the war in the Pacific.  This is understandable because the documentary was filmed and produced by British cinematographers.  The UK did not play a pivotal role in the war in the Pacific, as the Americans did.      On a scale, I rate this documentary series a 9.5 out of 10.  It's well worth the money, and is frequently shown on the Military Channel, by the Discovery Channel.  The DVD sereis however provides additional bonus material not seen in on the television programming.    It's money well spent, and for any WW2 afficionado, it's a must own.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|If you are an Eagles fan like I am, this video is top-of-the-line. You could not ask for a better example of what it's like to see them in person. Their performance is almost without flaw; they do every great hit you can think of and then some; up close and personal from beginning to end; plenty of laughs, thrills, and chills. When you finish watching this powerful concert, you'll feel like you were part of the audience . . . and you can experience it again and again. I saw them at Clemson University many years ago and I cannot say I didn't enjoy this DVD virtually as much as I enjoyed seeing them live. I am within a year or two of being the same age as Don Henley and Glenn Frey and have followed their careers since the beginning. It isn't difficult to understand why the Eagles have been called the \\"American\\" Beatles. If you can only have one live Eagles in concert on DVD, without question this Farewell Tour from Melbourne is definitely the one to own.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I wasn't expecting much when I purchased the K240 Studios.  I was just looking for a good headphone for traveling that was about $100.  And I think I'm getting more than my money's worth with these AKG's.<br /><br />I'm relatively new to the headphone world so I haven't heard a lot of pairs but I know what kind of sound I like as I'm sure we all do.  So here are my impressions of the good and bad of the 240's.<br /><br />The Good<br />-Very pleasing frequency response characteristics.  I'm not a big fan of too much treble and I think the 240's roll of the treble just about perfectly for my taste.  They have a fair bit of detail during dynamic passages but when things get quiet, they won't allow you to pick out every little inflection in the recording.  Mids are very well balanced in my opinion.  They sound very natural throughout the midrange and there are no peaks or valleys that I can hear.  Mids are not as forward as Grados but I still consider the 240's a pretty \\"lively\\" pair.  And bass is a pleasant surprise.  They go relatively deep (deeper than a $100 headphone should if you ask me) and the bass is always well-controlled.  I would say there's a bit of a bump in the upper bass but it's not something that's distracting.  Rather, it gives the 240's a \\"fun\\" sound that makes them a thoroughly relaxing listen.<br /><br />-Respectable imaging.  After about 50 hours of run time, I find the imaging very good for a headphone in this price range.  they're not the widest- or deepest-sounding cans I've heard but they present individual sounds in a very coherent and pleasing way spatially.  The right source material and amp will definitely make a difference in this respect, too.<br /><br />-Adequately comfortable - The pleather earpads do get a little warm and sticky but I haven't had any gripes about leaving them on for a few hours at a time.  I have a big head so I consider this a pretty positive thing.  I didn't think I'd like the self-adjusting headband for that reason but it's implemented very well and \\"hugs\\" the head nicely.  And I should also mention that when I first picked up the box, I thought somebody had forgotten to put a pair of headphones in it.  That's how light they are.<br /><br />The Not So Good<br /><br />-Construction - It's not awful by any means but the earcups in particular seem a bit cheap and the pleather earpads don't look like they're as solidly attached to the cups as they could be.  Neither of these items seem to affect the sound so they're minor gripes but on close inspection, the 240's aren't the most glamorous cans I've ever seen.<br /><br />-Break-in - I've never been much of a break-in proponent until I started getting deeper into higher end headphones.  And with that said, these definitely need some run-in before they relax.  Out of the box, the mids were more than a little shouty and the treble had a grainy quality that I wasn't a big fan of.  Imaging is really one-dimensional for the first several hours, too.  So give them some time and they'll end up sounding much better.<br /><br />-Cord - Again, not awful but I've definitely seen better cords.  The 240's cord just seems too small for such an otherwise substantial can.  I like the single-sided approach with the quick mini-XLR disconnect but the rest of the cord could be a little beefier.<br /><br />That's about it.  All in all, a fantastic can at a great price point.  4 stars for aesthetics and 5 for sound for the money.l and \\"hugs\\" the head nicely.

0553805371|4.0|The Grand Design is as good a book as any Stephen Hawking has written to date.  Walking through exactly what the purpose of cosmology and physics is really about.  The premise is simple...nature follows certain rules or laws that mankind can deduce.  The items we call exceptions or miracles are simply part of the complex design that make up the entire universe.  The discussion of God in a religious sense is minimal.  Where God is brought in is in the discussion related to what we do not know...in those areas most people will assume it is the hand (or will) of God that makes things happen.  Once mankind gains knowledge of the subject we can state 'how' things work and then ask 'Why does God...?'  There is no math in this book so that should alleviate any fear that one might have in picking up a Hawking book.

0446195529|4.0|American President James Brennan informs retired CIA assassin Stone that his country needs his unique skills.  Stone says he is John Carr and not Oliver Stone, American killer; he wants to refuse, but cannot.  The Russian control the illegal drug pipelines in both hemispheres and their government is involved in the lucrative trade as they see it as a means back to the top tier of superpowers.  Stone tells POTUS that this is his penitence from their last endeavor together when he rejected the Medal of Honor.  The impossible assignment is to learn all he can about the trafficking through Mexico and what can be done to disrupt it.<br /><br />Afterward, Stone is in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, when the British prime minister leaves only to have a terrorist attack occur.  Stone's mission changes to identify who is behind the assault as allegedly the Russian drug cartels are the prime suspects.  His partner is British MI6 agent Mary Chapman.  They need help as the enemy remains elusive, but neither trusts their own agency any longer as a traitor seems to have infiltrated either the CIA, MI6 or both.  Instead Stone reluctantly turns to Camel Club associates as he knows Shaw, Rhodes, Conroy, Ford and Finn has hit back and that they will never stay out of this dangerous inquiry anyway.<br /><br />The latest Camel Club thriller (see Divine Justice and Stone Cold) is an exciting action-packed tale that grips the audience from the initial meeting between Brennan and Stone.  Though the story line is similar to many in the genre, fans will want to know who was behind the bombing.  Filled with twists and fast-paced, Stone and the camel Club will soon find themselves trapped in aptly titled Hell's Corner with no way out except death.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

I was never fond of any of the Shopaholic books, but any book she writes that isn't a Shopaholic novel has been consistently good. This one is definitely my favorite of all of hers that I have read.     I would recommend this book, wholeheartedly, to anyone who enjoys a good, cute romance novel.
B000005GUL|5.0|I totally agree with the review which accords 5 star to Keilberth's most famous of all Weber's operas' version. I strongly recommend his Walhall \\"Oberon\\" by the same composer with a formidable Rysanek. One thing I cannot understand in the former reviews! Is it possible that both miss the \\"other\\" truly great \\"Freischutz\\", the only one which can stand comparison with Keilberth's. I am referring, of course, to DGG Jochum version with Ingmard Seefried (still in good voice), Rita Streich (sublime as always) and an unsurpassed Kurt Böhm as Kaspar. Jochum has been, at least for me, with Karl Böhm, the greatest of the last \\"Romantiker\\" music-makers. I have had the luck of experiencing both in live perfomances (Jochum with Amsterdam's CGO and Böhm with his VPO), and have a special devotion for the two (I still doubt who, of both, conducted a better \\"Tristan\\": in any case, I do not know a betrer rendering of this opera than theirs).  Take this review as a correction of what I think is an injustice to a great vrsion of Wberes, F.

B00004T9UF|4.0|As a kid, I used to hate this album for its lyrical references to violence. Now things changed. The Marshall Mathers LP features brilliant beats. This album made a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records since it became the fastest selling solo album ever with nearly an astounding 1.8 million sold in its first week, and it went on to sell 19 million worldwide (Wikipedia). It's #302 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The songs \\"The Real Slim Shady,\\" \\"Stan,\\" and \\"The Way I Am\\" were singles, but the tracks \\"Kill You,\\" \\"Who Knew,\\" \\"Remember Me,\\" \\"Drug Ballad,\\" and \\"B**** Please II\\" have beats that will entice you.
B0044IJ1S6|4.0|Please allow me to provide context:    I'm a genuine Depeche Mode fan.    That is, I do NOT lump Depeche Mode with The Pet Shop Boys and The Cure. I don't listen to Depeche Mode simply because I like the 80's. In fact, I'm a little too young to entirely remember the 80's.    I listen to Depeche Mode because they are Depeche Mode. Their lyrics, production, and melody are moving. I own their every studio album, single release, and compilation. I listen because their lyrics invoke, their melodies are ever evocative, and their production value is richly layered and beautifully textured. To look at Depeche Mode as 80's nostalgia is to look at a van Gogh as if it were 19th century magazine copy.    While I'm not claiming Martin Gore or Dave Gahan to be a Frederic Chopin or Gustav Mahler, I must say that it is only by a simple and inexperienced palate that one could lump Depeche Mode with the likes of many popular 80's bands.     That said, I would like to reiterate that I am a genuine Depeche Mode fan.     For three albums, I have missed Martin Gore's voice. It has seemed to me that, since Ultra, his voice had become over-dramatic and inundated with vibrato. I am certain that I am not alone in this feeling.  But tonight as my wife and I watched this recording, we were both swept with goosebumps. I'm not sure if he simply corrected his own style or if he'd received a certain amount of critical fan-mail. But the Martin Gore who'd sang 84's Somebody and 97's Home was present for this leg of the tour.    Point blank: if you miss the pre-dramatic-vibrato Gore and long to hear his encapsulation of pre-Exciter tracks... you will definitely enjoy this film.     A note of caution: the concert starts off with bland mixing and nasally vocals. Stick with the show, however, and you'll be treated with the talented (though evidently aging) artists with whom you've fallen in love.
0736092269|5.0|one of the best training books i've seen!     It shows you what muscle(s) each exercise is working by name along with a picture showing all the muscles in the area. It also shows you the position for each exercise along with injuries to avoid while weightlifting.  It shows exercise's for both male and female and weightlifting for both.  This book is a must if you are just starting and for people that have been exerciseing for years.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|I have seen many performances of Die Zauberflote on stage, on TV, and on DVD.  This is by far the best of the lot.  All of the performers are terrific.  Many reviewers have already commented on the outstanding work of Diana Damrau's Queen of the Night and Simon Keenlyside's Papageno and I completely agree.  However, I also want to underline the realistic emotions that Dorothea Roschmann was able to bring to her part as Pamina and the heroic stoicism of Will Hartmann as Tamino.  Ailish Tynan, a singer whose work I was previously unfamiliar with, is a highlight as Papagena- whenever she showed up on stage, sparks flew.  Franz-Josef Selig as Sarastro was able to be regal without being boring (it helps when you have a bass like his) and the Queen's Three Ladies were simultaneously beautiful, amusing, and threatening (no mean trick). Probably the thing that I liked best in this performance was staging the action in the Age of Enlightenment.  This underlined the philosophical elements that Mozart input into the opera and took away, or at least greatly diminished, the fairy tale, fantasy aspects that are often focused upon in other performances.  This staging also helped the humorous aspects of the Papageno/Pagagena relationship stand out since Ms. Tynan, dressed in garish 1960's/1970's garb, was an eye sore compared to the \\"proper\\" eighteenth century folk around her resulting in her performance being such a hoot (and was better than the P/P pair being dressed up as pseudo-birds).  All in all, this is a fabulous performance which I cannot recommend any more highly.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|First off, I have to admit that currently my husband loves many of the songs on Lady Gaga's The Fame Monster cd. He enjoys more of her songs on the cd than I do. Please understand that I do like some of the songs on her cd, but I am truthfully more of a Madonna fan. However, because I love my husband very much, I am inclined to keep an open mind to music and artists that he likes. The reason why I find this quite ironic that he is now a fan is due to what happened when she first came out. For a brief time I had her song \\"Just Dance\\" as my cell phone ringtone, and I enjoyed  the video and music to her \\"Bad Romance\\" song. Whenever, I would watch this video it was hard for him to fathom why I enjoyed listening to the song, let alone the rest of her music. However, once I purchased the cd, this changed. He and I share music with each other, and he started to enjoy many of her songs once he listened to them on his ipod. I had burned this cd to my ipod, and then he downloaded it to his mp3 player. Obviously, he now enjoys many of her songs with one of his top favorites being \\"Money Honey\\".  As for me it is a tie between the song \\"Monster\\" and \\"Teeth\\". I remember feeling compelled to buy this cd after I heard someone else listening to the \\"Teeth\\" song. I have watched some of her musical videos and songs to see some of her creativity showcased (such as in \\"Telephone\\").  When I lived in Orlando, Florida, many of Lady Gaga's songs were played on the radio frequently. Now that I live in the D.C. area, I still hear her songs, but I wish that they would play them more often. This is especially because her concerts sell out quickly.  I tried to get tickets to her concert in both Orlando and then in this area and both times, they were already sold out. This cd may take a while to grow on some.  She creatively pays homage to Madonna in some of her songs. In my humble opinion, her Alejandro video definitely pays homage to Madonna. The best way to determine as a litmus test, if you would enjoy some of her songs on this cd is if you enjoy Madonna's music. If you enjoy many of Madonna's songs, then it is safe to say that you are going to enjoy this cd.ould enjoy some of her songs on this cd is if you enjoy Madonna's music. If you enjoy many of Madonna's songs, then it is safe to say that you are going to enjoy this cd.
B0044E9LW6|3.0|First off, let me say thank you for keeping Ronnie's music alive and available for everyone to enjoy. Just some thoughts about the 1983 disc. What happened to Vinny's count-in before 'Rainbow In The Dark'? It was on the B side version (from 'We Rock'). Beginning of 'Stargazer' is on the 'Drum Solo' track. Also a small tiny edit (0:04) that's not on the BBC's original broadcast of Ronnie's intro to 'Holy Diver'. Compared to the version I've had for 25 years, this newer version sounds a bit muffled and not so clear. Haven't gone through the 1987 disc yet. Packaging is great. Will there be more live shows released? Maybe Spokane '84 or Worcester '85?
B00447G2T8|5.0|The Pumpkins are back in full force after the unarmed garbage which I hope they have sense enough not to ever do again!

B002N5N4M6|5.0|We aren't much for keeping up with weekly sitcoms so we enjoy watching the DVDs when we have the time.  This is one of the funniest sitcoms we have seen in a while.  Of course, we are pretty geeky and we can relate to these characters quite a bit.
B00280LYHS|5.0|i absolutely loved this book. it was definitely the best out of the series. rick riordan is a great writer. i've read all of his books, and this one is the best.     in the book, the titans face the demigods and the olympians in a war. percy is awaiting his 16th birthday. percy goes though many challenges, but the olympians evantually defeat the titans. since percy helped so much, the gods give him an offer to become a god on olympus. percy says no, because he wants to stay with annabeth. at the end, annabeth gives percy a birthday cake, they talk for a little while, and then they kiss.    i would definitley recommend this book to anyone. it is the best book i have read in a long time. i'm telling you right now, READ THE BOOK!!
1401224253|5.0|This volume has a great design, and the quality that its importance deserves.<br />There is no a childish approach of Superman: he is not consequently bad but just the result of different circunstances. The story starts with a revelation to its fictional world so big that is a social explosion and ends with a revelation to ours, the readers, that is so big that also is an explosion.<br />The drawing style is very well. It creates an atmosphere that seems reflects the feelings of the characters. The use of the color is very good. Point apart are the covers: beautiful exercises of design.<br /><br />Perfect Story. It was a pleasure read it.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This was a great buy and the quality of the picture is awesome. We just bought a blue ray and this was a great movie to try it on.
1594484775|5.0|I've been a big fan of Nick Hornby for years, but haven't read Juliet, Naked until now.  I'm glad I finally did.  While portions of it were slow (though that might have been intentional, mirroring how life seemed to the main characters for so long - slow and uneventful), I was interested and invested in the characters until the end.  It took me a while to figure out how the story had ended, but after some thinking, I've got an idea, and I love it.<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot - others have done a great job at that.  The characters are normal people that we would all know and recognize - people who have just let life get away from them, and are now wondering how they ended up where they did.  All of us need a reminder that life is short, and it's the stuff you don't do that you wind up regretting at the end.  They were able to find redemption, and that's inspiring.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Spartacus: Blood and Sand was amazing. I wish I had Starz,so I could watch the entire season. It has action, romance and suspense. It doesn't get any better than that.
B0021L8V1Q|1.0|Maybe I could say two stars but after the first movie, this let down was far too much a crash and burn. Knowing that a bad review will convince some people to at the least see how bad it was, I just hope no one pays money to see it.

B003ZWTGKU|4.0|This DVD is stunning from a musical and artistc point of view. Jonas Kaufmann is so well suited to the role and the entire cast is stunning vocally. The stage direction and sets and marvelous.<br /><br />But, the distracting video direction kind of pissed me off the first time I watched. It actually shows people behind the set or in the wings with a stage director waiting to come on DURING THE OPERA. It's weird. The Met broadcast viedos show behind the scenes between acts, but during the show. Come on.<br /><br />Without the distractions of the horrific video production I would give the production 5 stars. But 4 is as good I can come up with. All in all, some of the best singing available. It would make for a terrific CD!

0545123275|5.0|Here are some basics for the story.  If a wolf bites you, eventually, you will shift.  At first unstable, the shift provides cadence between winter and summer.  The cold brings on the shift.  The longer someone has been a wolf (years in the pack) the longer into the spring the wolf shift stays.  Eventually, the wolf takes over and the human is gone. The only thing the human keeps of him/herself is the eyes.  The wolves have the same temperament as their human counterpart.  Chemically unstable human = chemically unstable wolf.    Story:  The wolves got hungry one day while Grace was in her tire swing at the age of 11.  It had been a long, cold winter, and frankly, it was probably one or two of the crazy-eyed, unstable wolves.  They dragged her to the pack who mauled her a bit while she was in shock.  Grace's eyes locked onto a young wolf with gold eyes.  He saves her.  Explained how in the book.  Years pass, Grace grows up to be a 17 year old high school student, she guesses the wolves secret without guessing identity.  Crazy gun-toting dad goes hunting in the woods.  Wolves get shot.  Grace finds naked boy on her porch, bleeding to death.  He has gold eyes.      Grace:  Logical, analytical and responsible.  Dark brown hair and eyes.  Obsesses with the wolves, especially the gold - eyed one. Has completely irresponsible parents.  Best friends with Rachel and Olivia.    Sam:  Wolf boy.  Book smart, reads moody poetry, responsible, pure heart.  Frightened to get cold again.  This time when he shifts, it will be for good.  Emotionally scarred by broken parents.    Beck:  Introduced much later in the book, he is the father figure of Sam.  Intriguing character.  He's a wolf.    Jack:  Although peripheral in personality, he plays a major role in the story.  Half cocked.    Isabel:  Jack's sister, rich, attractive, stuck up, powerful, multi-dimensional, sarcastic and witty.    Rachel:  Doesn't play a big role in the story but her character provides great entertainment.  Love her dialogue and striped stockings.      Story Development:  Excellent.  The author tells the story without dragging it out.  Provides the mystery with the answers as they become known.  The story tells itself.  In fact, it was like a screenplay.  I watched the story play out on my brain's screen in color.  During the suspenseful and climactic moments, I saw the pictures in slow motion and heard U2 in my head.  Wish I could tell you why I chose U2, but I can't.      Character Development:  Excellent.  The major characters played their parts well.  The more Grace and Sam spent together, the more I understood both of them.  The relationships they had along with new relationships further revealed their complexities.  Again, loved Isabel and Rachel.      Dialogue:  Excellent.  There was plenty of dialogue to keep the story moving and the author provides wit and intelligence.  At times, the book waxed poetic in an obvious way which I rarely like.  Other times, the poetry was much more subtle and I was caught up in the cadence.  I felt respected as a reader that it wasn't explicitly explained.      Clean read?  Not completely.  Less sensuality than Twilight but more sexuality, although not explicitly described.  I'd rate it PG-13 only because the couple do have sex once.    Language:  Mild swearing.
0312360258|1.0|This book is absolute nonsense! I would advise you not to waste your time or money reading (or even considering reading) this book.<br /><br />Marked is about a teenage girl who finds out that she is a 'vampyre' and needs to go away to a special boarding school in order to have even the slightest chance of surviving the transition. Sounds pretty interesting, though I warn you not to become too enthralled by the heap of potential this book undoubtedly has, because it will ultimately disappoint you in the execution...<br /><br />My grievances are thus:<br /><br />* The book is written so poorly that for the first few chapters I was certain that this book was meant to be a parody about the vast amount of vampire and boarding school literature that fill the shelves at bookstores these days. But the further I read the more apparent it became that this book was not, in fact, meant as a parody (which would have excused all of my other complaints) but as a legitimate piece of young adult literature. The juvenile, amateurish writing is so terrible that it is an insult to teenagers everywhere. Teens are not stupid, they are not so ignorant that books need to 'written down' to them. It was in no way necessary to have a character whose sole purpose in the novel was to act as the stereotypical \\"Gay-Guy Friend\\" and constantly define 'big words' that the dumb teenage audience could not possibly understand otherwise...It is inexcusable to assume that your target audience (even if it is for a younger demographic) is not smart enough to handle a novel with intelligent discourse.<br /><br />* I also had a real problem with the portrayal of religious peoples within the novel. Marked portrays people of faith as being wholly closed-minded, ignorant and intolerant, with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Perhaps if this were restricted to a single character it might be easier to digest, however, it is a recurring generalization throughout the novel that people of faith are terrible monsters full of hatred and intolerance for anyone different from themselves. This is downright insulting to those of us who are religious. If the authors have a problem with religion, or organized systems of belief in general, fine...that is their prerogative, but to attack it so blatantly within a piece of fiction is not only stupid on their part (isolates possible readers) but it is simply in bad taste. Shame on the Casts for such irresponsible degradation.<br /><br />* Similar to my distaste with the quality of the writing is my distaste of the quality of dialogue and character development. The dialogue is embarrassingly bad. I was humiliated for the authors reading some of the characters conversations because frankly, I would rather lose both of my hands to gangrene than write and publish a book where any character over the age of five used the words 'poopie' and 'boobie'. That is simply disgusting. What teenager actually speaks in this manner? I am 22 years old, not so far removed from my own teenage years, and cannot fathom hearing a real teenage girl say anything like this in casual conversation. The characters are completely unbelievable. They are flat, silly and utterly contrived. Zoey is the epitome of any wish-fulfillment literature character: she is wittier, prettier, more powerful, blessed, and loved than any other character. She is product of the authors own personal fantasies of who they wish they were projected onto paper. The male love interest is boring. The arch nemesis is laughably cheesy and stereotypical. And the new gaggle of friends that Zoey makes at the boarding school have the potential to be interesting side characters, except that the characteristics which make them individually interesting are so overused that by the end of the book I was sick of the twins antics and of the words 'Okie' and 'Twang'.<br /><br />This book is not worth reading. Trust me, and all of the other people who have posted similar reviews. This book is a disgraceful portrayal of young adult literature, and should have never made it to publication.trayal of young adult literature, and should have never made it to publication.

On first listening  \\"Kingdom of Days\\" had me worried - had the great man finnaly found that place \\"we really want to go and walk in the sun\\", but if he has - (and who would deny him that place) -he hasn't forgotten the plight of the rest of us. I read somewhere the title track was written for President Obama - but I thought it was writtten for me !! except Bruce changed that line from (my) \\"...I sell the hammrs'\\"To \\"I swing my hammer\\".                                                    I thought it was cool someone had written a song about a girl working at the supprmarket 'Queen of the suppermarket'- most people don't give 'check-out chicks' a second thought. The saddest song - and Bruce does sad songs so well -is 'The last carnival' (about  Danny fedeici - E Street band organist who saddly ded of cancer) always makes me reach for my hankie. And \\"outlaw Pete' reminds us (as if we'd ever forget) what an awsome story teller the Boss is.  Long live Bruce and may he continue making relavent entertaining music for many years to come !!!

0142405787|4.0|I have read Anthony Horowitz books before but had stopped for a long time. I recently had to read a book for a class in high school and I choose to read the book Scorpia since it was the only Anthony Horowitz book that I have not read. I thought the book was kind of boring in the beginning because it started with Alex Rider going on a vacation and then ends up working for M16 for no reason. But what made this Alex Rider book different from the others is that he ended up working for some body else for one week. That helped him figure out what had happened to his parents. This book does put you on the edge of your seat because of all the action, and how it all turns out in the end.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Seriously, this is one of the best shows on television right now.  The series started off a little slow, but quickly progressed once the characters were more developed.  This series best depicts community college as I have seen it and as others have seen it.  Overall, it's a great series that is very promising as The Office begins to fade.

B002VKB0M4|2.0|sometimes you get Nashville and sometimes you get Paris, an overly stuffed, overly long and still inchoate piece of work.  We should all be as prettily perhaps dying as Romain Duris, a professional dancer who is told one day that his heart is going and he will need a transplant.  What he does then is mope around his lovely Paris apartment, which seems to overlook a cemetery, babysit his semi-estranged sister's three kids when she (Juliette Binoche) moves in to take care of him, and observe the comings and goings of his neighborhood.  He develops a crush on the student across the way who is being stalked by text messages from her professor.  And so it goes -- the professor has a damaged relationship with his brother, the vegetable man where Binoche does her daily shopping still loves his ex-wife, etc., etc.  The best scene is when the smarmy professor dances to Wilson Pickett's Land of a Thousand Dances, and it is the song, not the dance that makes that scene.  There's lots more, most of it scarcely worth a second glance, until the final scene of Pierre's taxi ride to his transplant appointment when director Klapisch appears to suddenly realize he hasn't shown us enough of The Eternal City so under the pretext of demonstrations throughout Paris necessitating a roundabout route to the hospital, the ride becomes a Paris-lover's dream with many long loving shots of its boulevards and monuments, and of course the obligatory glances at some of the characters whose lives have glanced off Pierre's.  Two hours is a long time to wait for that ride, way too long for me.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Gran Turino is an action filled movie starring Clint Eastwood. It is about an eldery man who recently loses his wife and finds comfort in the immigrant family next door. In the beginning you may find Walt as just another angry old man but throughout the movie you feel an attachment to him because you understand why he acts like he does. When he young boy next door gets out of hand Walt is pressured into having Thao work for him. After a couple of days Walt gets attached to Thao and his sister. Towards the end Walt makes an extreme decision in honor of the Hmong immigrant family next door.    This movie is a must see. Every little thing can be assessed and has meaning from the lighting to arrangement of the houses. I didn't understand why Walt did certain things and I quickly judged him as a grumpy emotionless man. But I really did appreciate him at the end. Whoever directed this movie deserves a standing ovation. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone! Though the language may be inappropriate for children.
1550379151|3.0|This is one of my favorite children's books. The story, of a strong woman and a vain man, is the perfect antidote to classic fairy tales.<br /><br />That being said, I won't buy this edition again. The kids didn't care a bit about all the details of the making of the book, and the story is buried part way through. Had they put the story first, then the details after, that would have been sweet.<br /><br />All in all, stick to the original printing of this book

It has the power to wake up older people who have settled for less than their best life and renew a purposeful and meaningful life. And it has the power to educate companies that when they change their culture to support the happiness of both their customers and the people who serve their customers, they create better results.<br /><br />As a mom, I've used Tony's work as the basis of conversation with my kids about decision making and designing a happy and meaningful life. Ava, a young entrepreneur who travelled with Tony on his Delivering Happiness Tour, was an inspiration to my own young entrepreneurs.<br /><br />As a business owner, Tony encouraged me to make sure that every member of my team understands the importance of putting our values into action in everything we do. His work shows that a website posting or a plaque on a wall is not enough - we need to weave these values into our days and use them to make even (especially!) the tough decisions.<br /><br />Tony's work also strengthened my belief in the importance of investing in my people and training our way to higher levels of success. Lastly, he reminded me of the importance of creating an army of unpaid marketers by over-delivering value and creating a customer experience that is worthy of being shared.<br /><br />No matter who we are and what we do, we are in the business of delivering happiness. Simple? Yes. Carries the power to make your life and the lives around you better when you keep this truth in the front of your mind? Absolutely.<br /><br />~Dr. Mollie<br />Author, The 12 Factors of Business Success<br />Founder, BestLifeDesign.com

B0041KKYDI|5.0|\\"127 Hours\\", director Danny Boyle's (\\"Trainspotting\\", \\"28 Days Later\\") follow-up to \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is a near great film. I honestly can't tell you the last time I was so moved by a piece of celluloid. \\"127\\" has created both pleasant and nightmarish memories, memories that will stay with me for many, many years to come.<br /><br />Aron Ralston (James Franco) quickly grabs some supplies and heads out to his favorite spot, the canyons near Moab, Utah. As soon as the sun rises, he jumps on a mountain bike and heads out to explore and enjoy the great outdoors, heading to a spot some twenty miles away. He crosses paths with two young women, Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) and agrees to show them the way to their destination. Once there, they swim and dive and have fun. After a few hours, they head on to complete their individual journeys. As Aron navigates a narrow crevasse, a small boulder comes loose, causing him to fall and wedging his arm between the wall and the boulder. He can't budge it and becomes worried at the sight of some streaks of blood. Aron takes stock and has very limited food, some water, stretchy cord, a camera, a video camera and a dull knife. Before leaving for the trip, he wasn't able to find his Swiss Army knife, so he is left with a dull give-away promotional knife. He tries to chip away at the sandstone, to move the rock, but doesn't make any progress. Over the next five days and twenty hours, Aron has to figure out how to use the limited supplies he has to survive until he can be rescued. Or, on the other hand, he has to figure out if and how he can get out of this situation on his own.<br /><br />Boyle starts the film by masterfully depicting why Aron, and others like him, are so eager to escape the city, eager to mountain bike in the wilderness, eager to climb rock formations, eager to backpack. When he meets the two women, they even remark about how they don't feel like they figured into Aron's day. Aron is the type of guy who actively looks for adventure and makes decisions on the spur of the moment. This is why he agrees to spend time with the young women, setting his schedule back half a day.<br /><br />As soon as Aron gets trapped, Boyle has to do something to give us more details into the adventurer's history. He has to make us care about this man and he can't really do that by keeping us only with Aron for the rest of the film. As Ralston tries to assess his situation, a memory surfaces and this gives Boyle the opportunity to show us a brief part of his past. The technique Boyle uses seems more suited for films made in the late '60s. And normally, this would drive me crazy. But in this situation, these moments work, primarily because they are pretty brief. They also move back and forth between more real and more imagined settings. For instance, Aron remembers a moment he and his dad shared during his childhood. They sit on an old couch in the family home, talking. Then his dad is gone and young Aron is still sitting on the couch, but the couch now sits in the crevasse Aron is trapped in, the sand and rock walls surrounding the furniture, visible to the side.<br /><br />Boyle introduces us to Aron's father (Treat Williams) and mother (Kate Burton) and the love of his life, Rana (Clemence Poesy). These moments, though brief, helps to give us insight into Aron's character and life. Because they are so brief, it is surprising that we feel we know Aron and his family so well. We really get a feeling for him and come to care for him.<br /><br />A lot of the credit for the success of this film lies with Franco. For much of the relatively short running time, Franco is the only person on screen and this would only serve to amplify any poorly acted moment, any false characterization, any thing that doesn't ring true. From the first moment he is on screen, we start to understand him. He is most happy when he is explaining what some stretch of wilderness is, the history of a cavern, earningsome bit of solitude to compensate for any minute of time he is forced to spend cooped up in the city. In this element, he finds peace and revels in every moment.<br /><br />When he meets Kristi and Megan, Franco's smile helps us recognize he simply wants to have a good time. Sex isn't a part of the equation, he wants to share some moments with like personalities. Later, when he is trapped and has a lot of time to think, he remembers back to some moments in his life. When we return to him, Franco's demeanor and facial expressions seem to be an honest portrayal of how the young man would react. And make us feel he is really remembering these moments.<br /><br />When Aron finally realizes what he has to do, Franco shows us the horror of this realization and the pain of this decision.<br /><br />THE moment is both necessary and extremely difficult to watch. It is necessary because it is a part of the story. But so many other filmmakers would shy away from a frank depiction of this moment. Boyle doesn't. Without it, the story would be nowhere near as impactful. Because of it, you might have nightmares. It would be gruesome enough, hard enough to watch if he had found his Swiss Army knife. But without it... I just shudder thinking about it again.<br /><br />The film ends with a coda giving us an update on Aron Ralston's life. During the moments before this, I started to tear up because he was going to be okay, because he was going to make it, something I already knew given he wrote the book this film is based on, but I was still extremely moved. And the last few moments give us a glimpse of the real Ralston and all of the people affected by this incident. Because of everything Boyle and Franco are able to accomplish throughout the film, I was extremely moved by these brief images.<br /><br />Best of all, Boyle ends the film, presents this coda, in a way stylistically in tune with the rest of the journey and all of those memory flashbacks/<br /><br />\\"127 Hours\\" is a great piece of filmmaking.

B003UERZ88|4.0|Great CD and not what I was expecting, once again Rob Halford puts out a very nice surprise with his very early Judas Priest sounding album.... go pick it up !!
0810994739|4.0|i would have wanted to know a summary of the book or what is was going to be like so i could see if i was going to like or not. The book came in great shape it was not torn apart. None of the pages were wrinkled at all and the book was fun to read. the book looked as if it came straight from the factory where it was made.
B000003S5H|5.0|I like all kinds of music from rap to rock to pop to electronica and some very  select country.  If someone forced me to choose my favorite album of all time, it would be this one. Not an easy choice...but this would be it.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This story was so human and raw in many ways and written from the perspective of little Jack.  The bond with his mother was tender and absent from all ego - and shed a light on the intimate love between this pair.  The beginning and middle of the story built up to a climax that kept me awake most of the night, but as the story progressed and came to a close, I almost wished for a different outcome.  Ended the book with kind of a dark sad feeling - This is a heart-wrenching tale that will keep you entertained... just plan on having a lot to think about at the end of it!
B0042AEOG0|3.0|I recently purchased this album and was not really sure what to expect.  While I thought Emancipation of Mimi was a return to Mariah's former glory, her follow-up to that album, E=MC2, fell short in my opinion.  So I really tried to go into listening to this album with an open mind and not let the things I didn't like about Mariah's last album cloud my judgement.<br /><br />I have to say I was pleasantly surprised on some of the songs, while others I could take or leave.<br /><br />The first song, Oh Santa is starting to grow on me.  It's upbeat and fast and I think it will fare well with younger listeners.<br /><br />Christmas Time Is In The Air Again is definitely more my style.  I feel the vocals on this track are more lush than some of Mariah's more recent recordings.  It was a nice change of pace and reminded me of a Mariah from 10 years ago.<br /><br />The good vibes continued on what I consider the standout track on this album vocally which is When Christmas Comes.  This song showcases Mariah in all of her former glory.  The vocals are thick and rich and, dare I say, powerful.  I like the vibe of the song, which is decidedly more old school.  It reminds of Subtle Invitation from her Charmbracelet album.<br /><br />I was also pleased that there were NO guest appearances.  Finally, an album that is all Mariah and no bric a brac from a bunch of \\"Rappers O' The Day.\\"  It was nice to be able to listen to this album from beginning to end and not have to skip tracks.<br /><br />Mariah's version of O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujiah Chorus seems ill conceived.  I get that she wanted to include her mother's operatic vocals on the album, but it seems poorly placed and not very well supported.  Her mother's vocals, which sound formidable in their own right, seem to be underutilized.  There was more than enough room in the Hallelujiah Chorus to find a place for her to shine and I think they missed the opportunity here.<br /><br />I'm not really sure why O Holy Night and All I Want for Christmas Is You (Festive Version) were included on this album.  They seem more like filler than \\"event\\" songs.  There's virtually no difference between these versions of the recordings and the versions that appear on her first Christmas album.<br /><br />Auld Lang Syne, the last song of the album is fun in a cheeky kind of way.  I'm sure it will be a hit in the clubs, given its up-tempo treatment.  However, with that said, I really don't think anyone should sing this song except Ella Fitzgerald, since I've yet to hear a treatment that compares to it.<br /><br />So, all in all, I think this was a good effort from Mariah.  She sounded like she was in good voice for the entire album.  She continues to experiment with a different sound vocally and while I am tempted to agree with other reviewers that her nasally/baby talk/whispery voice is a cover up for a degradation in her ability to sing with the same power as she used to, I don't buy it.  To get tehcnical for a moment, it is very clear that Mariah's usage of this technique is intentional.  It provides a different dimension to the vocals and while it is interesting to hear how she choose to apply it to the lyrics, it is actually more taxing on the voice to swtich in and out of the whispery voice to the full voice than if she just chose one style to sing in.  I think this is Mariah's way of continuing to distance herself from her former image and what better way to do that then sounding different, but I digress...<br /><br />To recap:<br /><br />If you like \\"Full-Voice\\" Mariah, download the following songs: Oh Santa, Christmas Time Is In The Air Again, When Christmas Comes, O Holy Night, All I Want For Christmas Is You and Auld Lang Syne<br /><br />If you like \\"Nasally/Baby Talk/Whispery\\" Mariah - download the following songs: O Little Town of Bethlehem/Drummer Boy Medley, The First Noel/Born Is the King Interlude, Here Comes Santa Claus, Charlie Brown Christmas, One Child<br /><br />If you like \\"Combination\\" Mariah and want to hear her mom sing - download: O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujiah Chorus.<br /><br />If you like no Mariah vocals and don't want to her her mom sing - download: Santa Claus Is Coming to Town Introf you like no Mariah vocals and don't want to her her mom sing - download: Santa Claus Is Coming to Town Intro
0060566108|5.0|Have you ever read a book that crystallized all of your thinking? That validated all of your beliefs? For me, this is the book.     In my opinion, this book should be required reading for anyone who is running a business, small or large. Collins & Porras provide a clear delineation between core values and purpose vs. strategies and tactics, and the use of each. They clearly explain the power of AND - of taking two apparently contradictory approaches and melding them together to create something stronger.     These two issues alone are reason enough to read this book. But, my biggest take away from this book was that no one approach to business is right. What works for one company may not work for another, and vice versa. What matters is that the approach your company takes is in alignment with your company's core values and purpose. This is what matters and will make it successful!    Karen L.

0439023521|5.0|Outstanding! I think I forgot how fun reading can be.  I mean, the page turning, stay up way too late, ditch your friends and real life so you can find out what happens next, kind of fun. Yeah, it's that good.      My roommate kept saying, \\"the book will be there when you get back.\\"  It's like I don't know her.  Or rather, she doesn't know me.  The book can not be abandoned.     And so, because I'm one of those people that loves to discuss book ad nausium with others who have read a book, I find myself harassing pretty much everyone I know, so that I can talk to someone else about how shocked I was by some turn of events, or how attached I became to certain key players, and how the book has really made me think about life in general.      I have now read the entire series (in less than a week, I really wasn't kidding about ditching my real life) and feel that after you read the first book, there will be no reason to read any further reviews... because you'll be hooked. So I'll leave my love rant here.     It's a page turner. A book where you loose yourself in another world and feel connected with the characters in the story in a way that feels, at times, more real that the people sitting next to you on the couch. I wish it could have gone on forever.    You have to read this book.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|So many unexpected things went right with Social Network. First and foremost, Jesse Eisenberg plays someone that is supposed to be irritating and unlikeable, and as such, is perfectly cast. Aaron Sorkin's often pretentious and over-written dialogue only shows its ugly head at the very beginning, when Eisenberg's Zuckerberg must make us hate him in a very small amount of time. David Fincher manages to force this talking heads subject into something not only cinematic, but strangely suspenseful. Few docu-dramas nail it so precisely, while also subtly bashing its own subject. Even the good guys in Social Network are pathetic and greedy, and as a film that seems to comment on these rich kids fighting over billions from the creation of the most superficial method of modern communication, it is sublime. Meaning alone can't carry it all the way to perfection though. The films is told in a `now and then' flashback fashion to keep its not none too interesting subject emotionally charged, but does lend a sort of superficiality to the experience, again, which is probably appropriate. Nonetheless, while entertaining and good for after movie conversation, this film won't be a topic for long, and is destined for an early demise on DVD.
B003YK42LQ|1.0|I started listening to Kings of Leon back when their first album debuted. I loved it. Their second album was a bit more evolved, less rowdy, more structured. I loved it. Their third album was a total departure, we saw the band go from a southern garage sound to a stadium sound...I LOVED IT. That's right. Loved the change. What you find about KOL fans that defend the early work is that they include Because of the Times in the \\"glory days\\", even though it wasnt the same kind of music as the earliest material. If that goes to show anything, its that the reason the early fans of KOL don't support them anymore isnt beacause they're famous, and isn't because the style of music is different. Plain and simple, the songs arent as good. Only By the Night was the album that made them huge, but it didn't pick up right away. I bought it the day it came out, and realized how the punch that was in their other albums was missing. I don't dismiss the entire album though. Crawl, Sex on Fire, and Use Somebody are all great songs. Only by the Night sounded like Beacuse of the Times without the energy and creative ideas. I was hoping for something  better this time around. Not so much a return to form, but a return to looking at songwriting from a more creative process.    When i first listened to this album from beginning to end, I honestly couldnt remember one song. Nothing stands out. They played it very safe, each song sticking to a mid tempo, over produced feel. Songs like Black Thumbnail and Arizon from Because of the Times have totally different personalities. Nothing on this album sounds unique. There's just simply a lack of good ideas, and a lack of passion in the songs. When you listen to something that you love, you can FEEL it. Trying to listen to this album was difficult, as I found myself spacing out halfway through trying to pay attention to each song. The music is uninspired and trudgingly boring. It became background music to me, as hard as I tried to find something tolike. \\"Mary\\" had its moments I guess, but not enough for me to justify it as anything more than the best song on a bad album. I love this band, they had 3 and 1/3 great albums, but I can't back this record up. I'll still pay attention to them when the next release comes around, but I'm hoping its better than this.
0307594777|5.0|Haven't read these yet?  Had a hard time starting it due to the Swedish names?  Get past that.  Not since Truman Capote's \\"IN COLD BLOOD\\" have I stayed up all night to read a book.  Difference is Truman's was based in fact and this is pure, raw, unadulterated, thrilling, chilling, mindboggling fiction, the kind no one seems to write anymore.      We rented the first movie before we read the book, got really excited and saw the second at a theatre with another couple, then read the third book before I could see the movie, 746 pages in paperback in just 2 days because I stayed up all night reading...I could not put it down.  The writer, who died before any of the 3 were published, planned 10 books about the same \\"Girl\\", Lizbeth Salander and a Magazine publisher named Mikail Blomkvist.  I loved them so much I bought all 3 in Hardback!     Read them or see them in order...a MUST to have them make more sense. Read and see the 1/3 of the total story left out of the movies, the background, side events and the author mind-reading of characters which is really helpful to understanding them.  The first movies since Godfather I and II which capture the book beautifully.  Any misses are because they don't drive the story, but provide background to the characters by helping to flesh them out.    Murders, rapes, espionage, government cover-ups and deceit, newspaper and magazine intrigue, courtroom drama, gossip, broken confidences, sex, sex trade, perversions, all leading to extraordinarily interesting conclusions and leading to the next book.      The Author died at 54.  CBS Sunday Morning reported that the author never made over $30K in a year, but his estate is now worth $20 MILLION and his common-law wife of 22 years got NONE of it due to common-law not being recognized by the Swedish Govt and having no will, his brother and father got the entire estate, EXCEPT that the wife is said to have possession of Book #s 4 and 5 and won't even talk with the family.  MORE INTRIGUE to come.  Read the books...See the movies, Swedish with English subtitles or dubbed.

This only happens when the music really moves me.  I see links to Avett Brothers and Kings of Leon, and I agree.  I love both of those bands.  If you do too, I would say you have to get this.  I'll be watching closely for their next release!
0805087184|5.0|This is a fun book with easy to predict rhyme that is great for developing vocabulary in young children:<br /><br />\\"Red Bird, Red Bird, What do you see? I see a yellow duck looking at me./ Yellow Duck, Yellow Duck, What do you see? I see a blue horse looking at me./\\"<br /><br />The book systematically introduces colors by paring them up with animal's names: not just brown, but a brown bear, not just red, but a red bird. The tissue-paper collage illustrations are rich in texture and add \\"movement\\" to animals. Clean design of the page with crisp text draws the eye towards the center of the page - an animal.<br /><br />Overall, this is a perfect book to instill a love of reading and wonder in young children.

B00006AW2M|4.0|I had avoided this album for years; exactly why escapes me (possibly all the negative hype).  After having worn out \\"Beggars\\" and \\"Exile\\", I recently began exploring other Stones albums, including this one. What a pleasant shock!  The album is actually quite solid, with enjoyable lesser-known songs that you'll never hear on the radio.    The cover is too obvious to be anything other than a probable \\"tip of the hat\\" to their rivals.  One source states that the Beatles' images are visible somewhere in it, though I can't confirm that.  Other obivious \\"tips\\" to the Sergeant include recordings of conversations infused in the music on some tracks.  The fifth track is the only real weakness here.  It is at best an overly-long free-form jazzy experiment with random noise.  It's interesting in that it predates Lennon's \\"Revolution 9\\" by several months.    Give this record a try.  It's truly a neglected Stones album.  Get the Russian CD MAXIMUM bonus tracks edition if you can find it.
B00275EHJQ|4.0|In terms of the bluray quality, there is none better.  The picture and sound are both reference material and are flawless.  A great movie to test out a home theater.  The movie itself is very good.  Pixar did a wonderful job of keeping the main characters around but still adding in great new additions, especially with Ken.  I was very worried about how they were going to finish the series off, but was shocked at how great of a job they did.  I'd prefer not to mention any details of the story, given I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen the movie, so the only thing I can say is the movie makes sense.  Andy has grown up and once again his toys are faced with challenges in how to accept changes in life.  It has a great moral backing and offers tons of well placed humor.  Overall the movie is fantastic.  Most importantly the ending is perfect.  Nothing was forced and everything ends how it should.  Toy Story fans should most certainly add the third to their collection.
142311339X|5.0|I personally did not read this book but my 10 y/o did & he LOVED it.  He is a huge fan of Rick Riordan.  The only thing that upset him was the fact that he has to wait til 2011 for the next book to come out.  Once it does though he will devour that book too.
B002LL13BQ|3.0|The year before- Carreras was in Glorious Voice, Cotrubas (made her debut) and it was Scotto's \\"first\\" Musetta. WOW! What a performance. (You can see a pirated video of Scotto's Musetta on YouTube). Of course, never recorded/televised. This production is way to glitzy- more production than taste. Here, Scotto's Musetta became a \\"cartoon\\" character. The ONLY Boheme` televised (i would get)is COTRUBAS and NEIL SHICOFF. IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|I'm a big Arrested Development fan and I feel like this show has that same ironic dry humor I loved so much with AD.  The writing is crisp, the laughs and gags are short and sweet, not overkill...and I like that in many of the episodes there is a sweet ending that shows how much the characters love each other despite dealing with family dysfunctions that we all can empathize with!<br /><br />The Blu-ray set has some good extras, but I would have loved to get some commentary and more behind the scenes features than what was offered.<br /><br />I am so happy that the Emmys rewarded this freshman comedy and hope that the writing remains strong and look forward to more episodes this year!
0316069485|3.0|I think Connelly trying to put both of his successful characters in the same story had spread it out a little too thin.     First of all, Micky Haller and Harry Bosch are very similar although their professions are different. Both are addicted or strongly committed to their profession. Both had broken marriage and a teenage daughter. Both had a wife they are still very much attached to. Both had wife that are excellent in their own field. By pairing them together in the same story, readers cannot draw any contrast of the two characters to give the story the dynamics Connelly hoped for.    Trying to give them equal face time is like reading only half of the story of Bosch and half of Haller. It doesn't have the detail and depth as in some of Connelly's better books.    The plot was not bad but definitely could use more sub-plots to compliment it. There could have been more tricks and schemes from the defense team, but the valuable pages were given to the equal time between Bosch and Haller.    I personally feel the ending was anti-climatic. Connelly made Jessup up as valiant but at the end, he just turned off the light. All the mysteries and suspenses about Jessup Connelly built earlier were never followed through to give readers the excitement or closure.    But, like most of Connelly's book, it was a good read. The most boring part was the re-reading of the previous testimony from 20+ years ago.    Connelly, hope your next one will be better than the last two. Don't make it a trend with this.
B00000IMTE|5.0|I owned the original album and after repeated playing and my father yelling turn that crap off, it began to pop and crackle and this cd brings me back to the old days with out all the extra static...including my father who i just had to call after recieving this in the mail while playing it... well he still doesn't like it but he said it sounded much better than it did back in the day. It is 1 of my favorites and they still play it on the radio. Great sound, cool music and great price. I just LOVE it!
B001FB563E|1.0|First off it took like forever to receive the movie.  If this is all the faster Amazon can deliver movies, next time I'll got to town and buy it.  Secondly, the Blue ray won't play in either Blue Ray player.  I've tried every adjustment there and it will not work.  I'm not spending more money to send it back only to wait to get another.  If there had been a no star rating I would of chose that one as it doesn't even deserve one star.  What a circus.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I am at a loss of words after watching the series over 2 days. PQ, AQ--outstanding. Just sit down with you HD TV and enjoy this series. You won't be disappointed.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|Not too long ago I was given a free download for the song `If I Die Young'.  The first thing I thought when it was over was that it was edgy, in a beautifully sincere way.  It wasn't simply trying to push the envelope, but it was brilliant in its mix of controversial topics and honest sincerity.<br /><br />That, and it was sung marvelously.<br /><br />The other day I was privileged to snatch up the debut album from the band, and I must say that I can't wait to see what they do next.  Sure, the standout track here is still `If I Die Young', and it is a song that I don't think will be forgotten soon (I see Grammy's and CMA's coming their way for this one) but the rest of the album is also very engaging.  It ranges in standard country fare, going from honky tonk energy to Alison Krauss worthy ballads.<br /><br />The album is flawed.  Songs like `All Your Life' are a tad timid and forgettable and `Independence' just doesn't capture the free spirit it was trying to attain.  But `Double Heart' and `Quittin You' more than make up for it.  `Quittin You' is especially superb, layering each moment of the track with spunk and lively energy that never leaves, not for a second (and I love the catchy chemistry presented in the chorus).  `Hip to My Heart' has a nostalgic personality, which is pretty nice (is sounds dated, but not in a bad way at all).  I actually love this song, especially the vocals on the chorus (\\"who\\" just hits the ears just right, adding texture to the song).  `You Lie' may not be the best track here, but it has a nice Miranda Lambert quality to it, one that sets you up for the balance of the album.<br /><br />The honky tonk rock quality of `Miss You Being Gone' is totally fun and catchy!<br /><br />Of the ballads, it's hard when your first single is so superb that the rest of the `like' tracks can't seem to stand up to it.  `Lasso' comes the closest, delivering a shiver inducing close out to the album.  It is mellow and earnest in all the right ways.  `Postcard From Paris' is simple yet memorable (and some kind of charming in all it's pent up aggression).  `Walk Me Down the Middle' is sweet, but it is also kind of sappy and generic.  It seems to be trying a little too hard.<br /><br />Overall, this album is one to get and one that introduces us to an up and coming band that is surely going to raise their game and stick around for some time to come!<br /><br />For those of you interested, my rankings are as follows:<br /><br />1) If I Die Young<br />2) Quittin' You<br />3) Hip to My Heart<br />4) Lasso<br />5) Miss You Being Gone<br />6) Double Heart<br />7) Postcard From Paris<br />8) You Lie<br />9) Walk Me Down the Middle<br />10) All Your Life<br />11) Independence(and some kind of charming in all it's pent up aggression).  `Walk Me Down the Middle' is sweet, but it is also kind of sappy and generic.

0792839730|5.0|This movie is handy in DVD because the viewer can do their own edit.  By skipping the anti-war scenes, a classic story can be told.  The briefing by General Browning are enough to tell you that the Brits were ignoring their own intel and the Dutch underground.  The breifing by Edward Fox is classic.  The German scenes are great and go along way to explain why things go badly.  The transition scene where General Browning is looking at the same map as the German high command is wonderful.  The take off and jump scenes are marvelous and make the purchase price worthwhile by themselves.

B003Z2LAAO|2.0|I waited in earnest for this movie to be released. Once I received it I was blown away by the 3D effects of the bubbles and water splashes in the intro. The aerial scenes of the Grand Canyon are gorgeous. So far so good. The problems become apparent when the ground crew and voice-over start their turn. The storyline is clichéd and gets in the way of the greater story - the Colorado River. A father taking once last trip down the Colorado river with his daughter is irrelevant. Perhaps a bit more history of the explorers and their tales of discovery would have added more to the movie. Again and again the viewer is inundated with a message that dams are bad for the local ecology, especially the ones on the Colorado River.     The camera crew tries hard to get some cool shots of the river while they make their way down on raft. Unfortunately, the cameras seem to too big and unwieldy for such an adventure. The footage is short and forced. Once on land the actors seem like props and don't help the movie at all.    This movie missed the mark. Some of the shots are stunning but overall the movies tries too hard push an agenda.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Spent alot of time doing research on the perfect set of headphones. Looked at new and used and from a 50 to 75 dollar price range chose these. Very pleased, great comfort, great sound quality 9/10 (slight buzzing when in complete silence otherwise not noticed) 5*s
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|Short and in a nutshell, this is the most unigue, creative and best performance in their career.  Tommy Bolin is amazing and a huge influence on this record.  Amazing how much they allowed him to input.  They are best by far with this version.  I love Deep Purple, more the Hughes, Coverdale era - love all three of those.  On the other hand, being a huge Tommy Bolin fan, this is also his best work.  Hard to say that with his two solo records being so good, but it is true.  This is not necessarily going to be liked by every DP fan, though.  This is definitely not the riff rock band of the past.  It honestly sounds like a different band.  Come taste this one for sure.
044654759X|5.0|Once again Nicholas Sparks has written an awesome book. The story kept me wanting to read on and not put the book down. It will make a fantastic movie! The intense drama was totaly awesome. Yet the calming smooth life in the southern town.  But when both joined together and you were \\"sitting on edge\\" to read more.  Well, Mr. Sparks thank you for a thriller of a book.

0307266303|5.0|This is a story of not only a group of runners in the canyons of Mexico but also the story of our evolution as a species.  Once you start reading this book, not only will it be impossible to put down but every time you do you'll just want to go running on the closest trail to your house!  A must read for all runners and an amazing motivational read for those trying to reconnect with themselves in a truly natural organic way.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Ok, so I've seen the movie like four times in the theater.  I love this movie.  I give it 5 stars because I like this movie alot.  With that said, this movie is not for everyone... there is a specific target audience this will appeal to: 1. You have read/like the Scott Pilgrim comic books, 2. LOVE video games <specifically old school style, think LOTZ, Mario, TMNT for SNES> and/or 3. a tweener who is obsessed with Michael Cera.    I think graphically it was very well done.  There was a nice mix of movie and video game scenes.  I think the editing of the scenes made for a nice twist and made it truly feel like you were watching a comic book come to life.  There are alot of little subtle things that made it great.  For example, the part with Walace's and Scott's little apartment of who owns what or when Envy calls him and they show the photobooth picture evolutions.  I think for those who are video games the extra life and whole final ex scene with Gideon was hilarious.    And yes (to other commenters) Michael Cera plays the EXACT SAME CHARACTER as he always does (ie Year One, Youth in Revolt or Arrested Development) but that is pretty much how Scott Pilgrim is written.  Michael Cera and his adorable awkwardness is Scott Pilgrim.  I do think there were some scenes where he could have been a little more animated but I think he did a good enough job.  Also part of the charm of this movie isn't so much Scott Pilgrim's development, it has to do with all the side characters.  Each character and their part or backstory make for all the amusing awkwardness and mayhem.    If you are unsure I would say watch it before you buy it.  If you fit into any of the above mentioned catagories, you will love it!
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I didn't become familiar with Doctor Who until Eccleston's Doctor, though I've since watched some of the classic Doctors. Tennant/Ten is \\"my Doctor\\" and I was sorry to see him go, but I figured I'd give \\"this new guy\\" a chance. When I saw him at the end of the End of Time, I thought he was going to be a poor take on Tennant's manic sort of Doctor.    Thankfully, I was wrong. The melancholy that plagued Eccleston's and Tennant's Doctors is gone. Matt Smith is a very different Doctor, much more lighthearted and alien that reminds me a bit of Tom Baker's fourth incarnation, with some additional self-confidence thrown in. It's easy to believe that he is someone not to be tangled with. At times he seems to be somewhat disdainful of his companions, and there are a lot of human traits that seem to puzzle him. Nonetheless, I've thoroughly enjoyed Matt Smith's 11th Doctor. Amy Pond is an enjoyable companion, though frankly Rory tends to annoy me. All in all, I enjoyed this series and can't wait for the next one. :)
0439023513|5.0|most insane trilogy i have read, this takes future dystopia to another level, yeah Katnis changed and so did Peeta, but if you think about it, it was bound to happen, seeing kids/people die in front of your eyes doesn't keep you prone to happiness. when i first read it i was horrified, and confused, but seriously it makes sense after everything that happened. or all i really liked it, it just takes a while to get use to, finishing that story left me numb, but i wasn't the only left like that.

If you sell anything, I highly recommended this book  to you.

0385341008|5.0|I know this is a fictional book, but each of the letter writers have become my new best friends.  So much honesty and warmth in the letters from most of them, and so much truth about what went on during the war in their part of the world.  I loved getting a new perspective of WWII.  I'm recommending this book to all my friends and family.
0316069884|2.0|I have read few books as aggravating as Eating Animals.  Read this very carefully:  I fully agree with Foer that our system of industrial meat production should be banned immediately, and that consuming industrial meat is not ethical.  Foer makes this exceedingly clear in his book.<br /><br />My ancestors have been eating the meat of wild animals for a million years, and I am not convinced that this is a problem.  I believe that eating wild meat is sacred and healthful.  Unfortunately, at this point in time, we cannot return to a diet of wild foods, because there are too many of us -- but it is possible to raise grass-fed animals in a low impact manner, and ethical ranchers are doing this today.  For almost all of human history, humans lived in a relatively sustainable manner, and meat was a part of our diet.  Our brief era of extreme unsustainability began with the emergence of domestication and organic agriculture.<br /><br />I have two issues with this book.  First, is Foer's premise that animal life is more sacred or important than plant life.  Eating carrots is right, eating chickens is wrong.  He exhibits a profound lack of reverence for plant life, which puts him at complete odds with almost all of the cultures in human history, except for the new ones, which are furiously destroying life on the planet.  This premise is the foundation of his book, but he never explains why he believes this idea to be true.<br /><br />Second, Foer pays no attention to the way in which plant foods are produced.  His book is focused on eating in what he believes to be a moral and ethical manner, but it is silent on agriculture, which is far more cruel, kills far more animals, and causes far more suffering.  A chicken suffers for a few weeks, but it takes thousands of years to replace soil -- the entire ecosystem suffers.  The once-thriving civilization of Uruk destroyed itself via organic farming.  It was completely abandoned in 700 AD, and remains a wasteland to this day.  Modern farmers are even more skilled at destroying soils.  Despite the trendy hype, most modern organic farming remains unsustainable.<br /><br />How can we eat plant foods without destroying the future?  That's an immensely important question.  Go to the grocery store and look for soil-friendly food -- nuts, berries, fruit, wild seafood.<br /><br />The elephant in the room is overpopulation, which appears in one sentence of this book.  A healthy population requires no slaughterhouses, meat packing plants, or domesticated animals.  A healthy population requires no agriculture.  It is absolutely impossible to feed seven billion people in a manner that is even remotely sustainable (and probably not one billion either).<br /><br />If you are in a sincere quest for understanding, I would recommend that you also read The Vegetarian Myth, by Lierre Keith, an ex-vegan.  She does a fine job of telling the story from a very different perspective.  It's always good to contemplate other viewpoints.  Weston Price also presents very stimulating ideas about food.  I hope that Foer's next book is called Eating Grain.n more skilled at destroying soils.  Despite the trendy hype, most modern organic farming remains unsustainable.

0385335997|5.0|I just finished book 3, \\"Voyager\\" of the Gabaldon series \\"Outlander\\" and am still entranced with the characters and their adventures.  I've ordered the next three books so I won't have to wait long between finding out what exciting journeys Gabaldon has in store for me next.  Her Jaimie is the man most every woman dreams of but never finds, because men like that don't exist in real life.  Or at least in my 69 years on this earth, I haven't found them.  Having visited Scotland this year and studied up on its history I admire this series even more because it follows the facts in the history books.
B00004W55E|2.0|I'm her biggest fan, i praise her voice to everybody that would listen. I have all her cd's and i thought she could do no wrong, that's why i bought this on sight instead of sound. i figured i did'nt have to hear it because it was rachelle ferrell!!! boy was i wrong and disappointed to the point i've had this for years and only listened to it once. i still love her and i think she has the greatest voice ever. TO REALLY APPRECIATE HER VOICE YOU MUST GO SEE HER LIVE OR AT LEAST BUY HER CD- LIVE IN MONTRIEUX!!! i've seen her live every time she was here and her voice is unique and awesome!
1439177783|5.0|One of the most honest accounts of a struggle with anorexia that I have ever read.  Thank you for this book!!!!!!
1438509480|1.0|I have to agree with the other negative reviewers -- the book is almost unreadable. The introduction is filled with random text characters, and it's just ugly. The translation is also difficult to read. The volume contains no information at all about who did the translation or when it was done. It's really awful. I ended up buying another version of the book elsewhere.
030745455X|5.0|I am now reading the third book in the trilogy and am SO SAD that there will be no more. I am fascinated by Larsson's stories and by the fact that he died before these 3 books were published. What wonderful writing and reading! I LOVE Lisbeth Salander. She's the best character I've read, well, maybe ever. These are BY FAR my favorite books and I read 5 to 10 books a week! Anyone who loves crime fiction with more than your average private dick characters (too common!) will LOVE this book and it's two sisters. READ IT! You'll love it as much as me! GREAT WORK!!!
1400064627|5.0|I may have been the only one who didn't know Fried Green Tomatoes was based upon a book.  Consequently, I was thrilled when I saw a tattered copy in the used bookstore.  Ms. Flagg is an engaging author.  Her characters sprang to life through her writing style, leaving the reader begging for more.<br /><br />Like the movie, Cleo Threadgood, age eighty six, shares her memories of life in Whistle Stop, Alabama with Evelyn Couch, a younger woman who is attempting to discover who she is.  They meet in a nursing home and strike up an unlikely friendship.  The story alternates between such memories and Evelyn's journey of self-discovery.<br /><br />If you like the movie, you will find the book to be just as good, if not better.  I highly recommend this book, and the author.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|If it wasn't for his work in \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" I would never have known the name John Cameron Mitchell. So, I was surprised when I heard that he had written and directed, \\"The most sexually explicit American movie ever made outside the porn industry.\\" I didn't really want to see it... and avoided it for the past three years. You must understand that, \\"Hedwig\\" had touched me on such a deep and profound level, that I didn't want to see, what I supposed would be, a misstep by one of the creators.     I've read enough reviews to see I am not spoiling anything by writing that most of the sex takes place in the first 10 minutes... that's not to say there is not enough sexual content in the remainder of the movie to warrant an \\"X\\" rating, but, once you are 10 minutes in, there is no slippery slope any longer!     The movie is definitely not a porn flick. Once the characters are established the sex is no longer the novelty you might expect it will be. You are living these peoples lives with them-only uncensored.    I believe this was the next, most logical direction for Mitchell to go in, as an artist. I consider it of the best movies I have ever seen. It was very real.     I can't give enough praise about this movie.  Like, \\"Hedwig\\" It touched me deeply and profoundly. I wish it was around when I first came out of the closet.

This is a masterpeice of progressive rock; and what a fabulous guitarist in Gary Green, check out the double lead on \\"No God's A Man.\\" A beautiful renaissance-style song with a hard-rocking jam in the middle, that song alone is worth the price!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|When I decided to read ROOM, I didn't really know what to expect. I knew it was an extremely difficult subject matter and that it would probably keep me up at night. I was right. With the entire story being told through five-year-old Jack, I have to admit that it took me some time to get used to his vocabulary and speech but once I got used to it, it flowed. All I can say about this book is WOW! This is an incredible story of a young woman trying to raise her son in unthinkable conditions without allowing the horror of their situation to affect him. The innocence that Ma is able to maintain in Jack's mind is vital to his development in becoming a 'normal' kid.     There were times that I thought I just couldn't take anymore of the story but I knew changes were coming. It was worth all of the angst and sorrow I felt for Ma and Jack. Emma Donoghue painstakingly takes the reader through every minute of every day to establish exactly what it must have been like to be held captive while trying to make the best of it for the sake of her child. The lengths she goes to and what she endures is simply astounding.     As their story unfolds, Donoghue continues to share each moment and each new experience in such a precise and methodical way that it only makes it even more realistic. She also has done an amazing job of staying true to the telling of the story in a most unusual, effective manner. She never once waivers from Jack's own words or way of speaking and that is a feat in itself. To maintain such a difficult story from a child's perspective has to be very difficult and she does it masterfully. The writing is raw, honest and absolutely different than anything I've ever read in my life. This is a book that I am certain will stay with me indefinitely. That said, it is a book that will not appeal to everyone. I have to admit that there were times in the first quarter of the book that I didn't know if I could stick it out but I kept reading. For me, it was more Jack's way ofspeaking and the day to day details that wore on me, but then I realized that was the author's intent. She had to show the monotony of each day. This was their life. It was all they had and Ma was simply trying to make the best of it for her son. Once I realized this I also appreciated what Emma Donoghue had accomplished with this book.     Another wonderful thing about Jack is that he tells us his mother's story without even realizing it. Through things he sees and hears, he pieces together for the reader important details about his mother's life even before he was born. Most times, he doesn't even realize what he has actually learned. After reading this book its easy to see why Emma Donoghue has received such high praise. Will I recommend this book? Absolutely, but with a warning that it isn't an easy book to read, but well worth the journey.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|THIS IS PURE MARKETING GREED!  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHY THIS IS STILL NOT BEING RELEASED IN 3D!  \\"LET'S MILK THIS MOVIE FOR ALL WE CAN GET\\" IS THE APPARENT ATTITUDE OF THE STUDIO & DIRECTOR.  THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE IN 3D & I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE TO BUY IT IN ANY OTHER MODIFIED FORM, EXTRA FOOTAGE OR NOT.  ANOTHER BEEF I HAVE IS THIS WHOLE NEW 3D BLU RAY TV & PLAYER GIMMICK!  I HAVE A HIGH DEF. WIDESCREEN TV & ANY DVDs OR BLU RAY MOVIES I'VE BOUGHT IN 3D LOOK FANTASTIC ON IT.  THERE IS NO NEED TO BUY ANOTHER TV & PLAYER WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY IS JUST FINE ALREADY (NOT TO MENTION CONSUMER AFFORDABLE).  THIS IS JUST ANOTHER EXCUSE TO MILK THE CONSUMER DRY!  I HOPE MORE PEOPLE BOYCOTT THIS GREED AND WAIT FOR THE STANDARD DVD/BLU RAY 3D EDITION (IF THERE WILL EVER BE ONE).  IN THIS ECONOMY YOU WOULD THINK THESE STUDIO HIGHER UP's WOULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE COMPASSION FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS 3D FANS.  I OWN OVER 300 BLU RAY's ALREADY,  THIS WILL NOT BE ONE OF THEM, I'LL WAIT FOR THE ORIGINAL 3D VERSION.  Further more, If the studios aren't playing Marketing games then why not release this in a 3D/2D version and let the public decide which they like better.  The least they can do is give the public the choice, i mean if they are milking this movie and making $30-$50 per collector on various versions, why not due a limited release in 3D.  It will only make more money for them as most people will Purchase it again to have it in its original format. Let the public decide, 3D Works Fine for me on my High Def (not 3D) Television & my Blu ray (not 3D) player!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|First season was very boring, predictable and a bit cheesy. You have a few people walking through the woods and then out of nowhere, they'll kill everyone that messed with them. And my girl Kalan, didn't even get one drop of blood or mud on her nice outfit, robe or whatever you call it.    Fast forward to season two. Boy the writer and the story takes lots of unexpected turns. I loved it. You actually see the characters' nice and evil sides. Most of these actors are from Australia, England, New Zealand and even from Wales but you'd never know it. Lots of handsome men. Richard's six pack was another situation by itself. I wish they marketed this show better than they did. For now, I loved it so much that I stole the Wizard of the First Order's Name for my Amazon account. LOL
006088732X|5.0|All I can say is wow! I mean this book is very hard to review because it is that good. Well for one thing if you are a fan of mysteries this is your best pick. The first book is the best in the series and is very hard to put down. The major storylines are Emily growing close to her new friend Maya and I may say a bit to close! Also Aria having an affair with her teacher Ezra. Spencer growing close to her sister Melissa's fiance. Hanna with her shoplifting issues. Trust me this book is great and has many juicy secrets. One way to explain it is Desperate Housewives/I Know What You Did Last Summer. Very good book worrth the purchase I reccommend the Hardcover edition because the paperback is esy to rip.

B0027REDK2|5.0|This is a really great release of the classic Rio album. However, I am a little mystified by Hungry Like the Wolf, the U.S. remix. My original album, which was unfortunately lost in a flood years ago, had a totally different version of that song on it. I remember it was listed at 6:37 on the album itself. It was basically an extended version of the Night Version with the instrumental beginning and such but it was longer. The ending was different too. I am going crazy looking for this version as it has never been released on CD that I know of. Has anyone else heard this version? I am wondering why I had this on vinyl and now this newest release claims the 4 minute version was the original U.S. mix release. Did I lose a special edition release of this album? I can't seem to locate a longer version then the night version either so maybe I am just going crazy.....LOL! I distinctly remember the instrumental beginning though and the lengthened ending and when I first heard the Night Version I was happy to have at least some of that version back. Anyone else ever heard of this mysterious version?    This is a great album overall and I was glad they did release the U.S. version again after all this time.

Some flour foot prints, oh wow. Painting my house is more entertaining. Whoever gave this movie a green light is beyond me. Sorry.
B00402FGD0|5.0|All but one of the tracks here come straight from the same remasters that were issued last year. The only new remaster here is \\"A Day In The Life\\"  which appears without the fadeout from the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" reprise at the beginning (similiar to the 1993 version). It's a great summary of their post Beatlemania years. The T-shirt is XL so if your size is that or L, then it will fit. If not, then you're just better off getting the album sans the shirt. Definitely makes a great gift.

0811826848|5.0|Being a big fan of the fab four I purchased this book because I was satisfied with the Anthology DVDs. Yet this product (the book) has taken learning about the group to a whole nother level. It's very personal and detailed. It does a great job of letting the Beatles tell their story  by using quotes by each member as though they were talking to you. The quotes are from different periods in their carreer and most have a number by them so you know when a band member had that thought. The book starts off with a bio of Lennon (again in his words) and then moves on to the rest of the boys. For any Beatles fan that wants to expand their knowledge on the band, purchase this book. However with that said, this book is monsterous, so you won't be reading it while you travel. I'd call it a coffee table book, but honestly it's about the size of a small table. So be prepared for it to be the biggest book in your library.  Purchase this book in hardback, you'll love it.
0060558121|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  It's wildly entertaining - impossible to put down.  I've bought more copies of this book than I even know - I give them away just to share this story with people.  If you've never read it, you really should.<br /><br />The main character, Shadow, is strange and interesting and boring and epic and small and extraordinary and average.  He's a sort of every-man and he's so much more.<br /><br />The \\"Coming to America\\" stories are great and are dotted throughout the book.  There are poems I studied in college that I recognized - a line from e.e. cummings \\"in Just\\" (which still to this day creeps me out) was exactly the perfect line to set the mood of the chapter it precedes - it sends a shiver down my spine.  Gaiman is great at choosing exactly the correct piece of literature to set the mood.<br /><br />I have listened to this on audio book and I've read it in paper copy many times and I've read it on my kindle and on my kindle app on my phone - it's amazing and I love it.
B003L8GPSY|5.0|There are no players like Trower anymore.  This is one of the greatest discs of all rock time.  I'm like an old dude who loves even the rock of today...but lemme tell you younger rockers, this has stayed with me since it first came out.  There's just something about this disc...almost mystical, ya know?  In the title track you can almost feel the pain of the prisoners walking over the Bridge of Sighs in Venice before heading into prison for life, seeing the outside world for the last time in the ancient days.  Rockers like The Fool and Me, Little Bit of Sympathy and of course, Too Rolling Stoned are just powerful.    dudes who like to crank it while driving...the rockers on this one are some of the best for hitting the road.    And for laying back on the homefront, the blues cuts are awesome.    there are only a few discs from the old days that have stayed with me...Led Zep II is one...and this one is up there in that category.    Buy it.

0060775858|1.0|Man, those other 1-star reviews were right: this book sucks! I tried to read it to my son when I first got it, and he was like \\"Dad, I'm playing Halo! Get out of my apartment!\\" Oh well, one down. Maybe my other kids'll like it, or so I thought...    After that, I went and tried to read it to my youngest daughter and guess what? She fell asleep halfway through! It's so boring that it put a 6 month old to sleep. What a ripoff!     Finally, I read it to my 3 year old daughter, and she was more impressed by my [[ASIN:B002HJ377A The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee]]! In a moment of genius, I replaced the word \\"Goodnight\\" with \\"Three Wolf\\" in the story, and it was like a flock of angels came down and ripped an awesome power chord- rocking my daughter to sleep.

I am quite liking it and this is the first auto-bio that I am reading. From what I have read, i found it really interesting to know how many hardships this person has faced to become such a big personality. Will come back and update the review once I finish reading.

0307454541|3.0|I had been dying to read this book.  All the great reviews and buzz about it made it enticing to me, while at the same time I'm always a bit wary of \\"the best ___  EVER\\" claims.  At any rate, I found a decently priced copy at Walmart and read it.  I read 10 pages, and then put it down for a month.  I read the next 40 pages, and put it down for a few more weeks.  Finally I picked it back up, persevered and eventually became engrossed.<br /><br />This book can be split into 3 parts (if I remember correctly, I think it actually is, but I mean in terms of pacing).  The first part lasts around 200 pages, and did not draw me in at all. It consists of a fairly long and boring introduction to the story, sets up the characters and plot, but doesn't really make any character appealing. The second part is where the meat is.  Character development, plot development, clues and finally resolution.  Even though I'm still not sure I like any of the main characters, and the story has a few deus ex machina moments for me, this part of the book held my attention with both hands.  The final part of the book is the shortest, but not much more interesting than the introduction.  The main plot of the book has been resolved, but now far too many pages are spent on resolving the subplot and setting up for the next novel.<br /><br />All in all, I did finish the book.  I'll probably read the 2nd and 3rd books.  But for some reason that I can't quite grasp, I'm not sure if I actually LIKED the book or not.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|While there are legitimate concerns about packaging and the extras, it's difficult for me to really complain, simply because I found the stories in the collection to be worth the money.  David Tennant has become one of the most beloved incarnations of the Doctor, and his send-off is suitably dramatic.  The specials take the Doctor through a roller coaster of emotions, and for the first time we truly get to see the Doctor at his darkest.  It's both exhilarating and frightening (as the Doctor should be) and it helps to balance the disappointment of knowing that this is the last of Tennant we'll see in the role.  This is partly because it's a satisfying conclusion and partly because the events that transpire force the Doctor to become something that viewers understand is a bit of something twisted--a character arc that comes full circle in the two-part finale.  These are dark episodes, bittersweet and powerful, and Tennant's acting ability is impressive.  For the first time, we see him manipulate the world to his own liking, and it provides a sense of the necessity of the regeneration.  At the end, Tennant's doctor, for all of his fear of being left behind, manages to convey the impossibility of following this path.  He's tired, he's a little broken, and he's losing his way, and a fresh incarnation manages to be almost a relief, as I was left with a sense that I would rather see him regenerate than self-destruct.      That doesn't mean that the last three episodes don't leave you with a bit of a broken heart to see Tennant go, but it's the kind of ending that dazzles.  As much as I loved the Parting of the Ways, I really appreciated being able to see the emotions and tribulations of a regeneration in more depth, and to witness his attempt to say his farewells was lovely.  And frankly, I needed the opportunity to wallow.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|And a movie lover's best friend is a transfer engineer who /really/ knows what he's doing.<br /><br />I've had the LaserDisk and DVD editions, and wasn't sure what to expect from the Blu-ray.<br /><br />GASP! Let's add a second gasp... GASP!!! Squared.<br /><br />This is one of the finest home-video transfers I've ever seen. It beggars description. It's subjectively perfect -- not one scratch, piece o' dust, or blemish of any kind. And it appears that little or no edge enhancement or grain reduction has been used, a problem with too many Universal transfers. (Slight grain is visible when standing near the screen.) I assume the transfer was made from the composite negative, but no information is given.<br /><br />Even more importantly, \\"Psycho\\" /looks/ quite different. I have never been so aware of how beautifully detailed and near-palpable the image is. Hitch couldn't have seen it better on the set. And the detail doesn't hide the fact that \\"Psycho\\" is not an example of \\"lush\\" B&W cinematography. I wouldn't call it \\"clinical\\", but -- /except/ where appropriate -- it has a matter-of-fact quality that fits the subject matter. More than ever, one is aware of the contrast between the plainness of \\"the outside world\\" and the \\"decorative fussiness\\" of Mrs Bates' home and furnishings.<br /><br />Watching it on a 60\\" plasma display, I felt I was sitting about 2/3 back in the theater, seeing \\"Psycho\\" with the sort of detail and clarity one /never/ sees in a theater. (I saw it \\"new\\" 50 years ago, and there is no comparison.)<br /><br />As for the film... One critic said that American films could be divided into \\"pre-Psycho\\" and \\"post-Psycho\\". \\"Psycho\\" is one of the most-influential films ever made, and was one of the first (if not the first) in a string of standards-stretching films that would bring an end to the Production Code eight years later and its replacement by the current ratings system. The hyprocisy of the Hayes Office was shown by allowing Marion and Sam to engage in sex without the benefit of marriage -- which didn't matter, because less than an hour later, she was punished for it. Nor did the Vegamatic scene seem to bother the censors. They were more worried about the toilet in the bathroom, which appears to be the first time a sanitary appliance was shown in an American film. \\"Psycho\\" received its Production Code Seal, and American parents actually took their kids to see it (as mine did). (Though \\"Psycho\\" was at one time rated GM (PG), it is now correctly rated R.)<br /><br />There were dissenters, of course. \\"The American Fascist Review\\", which, even in 1960, had long been complaining about the lewdness and immorality of American films, nearly went Postal over \\"Psycho\\" -- though I have to admit that its complaint about parents taking their children to this film had /some/ justification.<br /><br />Hitchcock was a master at getting the audience to identify with characters we're not /supposed/ to identify with. You /feel/ Marian's guilt about stealing the money, and when her car stops sinking in the swamp (to intentionally comic sound effects), you /want/ it to continue sinking so that Norman's mother won't be hauled away by the police. NO ONE has ever manipulated an audience the way Hitchcock does -- he saw it as the basic thing a director \\"does\\" -- so is it any wonder he's still called The Master? We /know/ Hitch is manipulating us -- and we love it.<br /><br />It really needs to be driven home that \\"Psycho\\" set a standard that hasn't been surpassed. Most (though not all, of course) post-\\"Psycho\\" attempts at making suspense and horror films are pathetic.<br /><br />A /lot/ has to be said about Anthony Perkins' performance, which simultaneously cemented and ruined his career. It's another one of those \\"Why didn't he get an Oscar nomination?\\" performances that litter Hollywood's history. He manages to be simultaneously frightening and pathetic, and believeably fluctuates between the normal and the weird. It's vastly superior to Anthony Hopkins' turn as Hannibal Lecter, which is a largely one-note performance that nevertheless won Hopkins an Oscar. Seeing this magnificent transfer on a large display makes it easier to appreciate the subtleties of Perkins' and Leigh's performances.<br /><br />I could spend a whole review on just Bernard Herrmann's music. Unlike most modern scores, it's not a continual background drone. Herrmann put music where /he/ thought it was needed, so it plays an important role in establishing mood and character. Note (no pun intended) how effectively the music mirrors Marian's turmoil when she's packing to leave -- she hasn't quite made up her mind whether to steal the money -- and when she's driving.<br /><br />Though Herrmann generally steered clear of the string section (his scores tend to focus on the brass and woodwinds), this, his most-famous score, is /all/ strings -- \\"a B&W sound for a B&W movie\\", as he said. It's rare these days for a score to even remotely approach the quality of a Herrmann score -- composers seem deathly afraid of writing anything that might attract the viewer's attention. Hitchcock attributed 1/3 of the film's success to the score, but this compliment runs both ways -- Hitchock /gave/ Herrmann a film he could write highly effective music for. When William Friedkin told Herrmann he wanted \\"a score as good as Psycho's\\" for \\"The Exorcist\\", Bennie, in his inimitably blunt manner, said \\"Give me a /film/ as good as Psycho\\".<br /><br />An absolute necessity for any Blu-ray collection, in a transfer that -- for once -- matches the quality of the film.<br /><br />PS: Let's get this straight, once and for all... \\"Peeping Tom\\" is /not/ a \\"British 'Psycho'\\". It's a piece of Emetic Cheeseburger &lt;stuff> (you can't use the C word in Amazon reviews) that doesn't come within light years of \\"Psycho\\". There, I said it.

0061914177|4.0|When I first got this book I was under the impression that this was going to be my toolbox. I got the impression that after reading this book I would be ready to push my podcast to the next level and take the world by storm. A little naive? Definitely.    There is no doubt that Gary V has an infectious personality. The energy that he puts into everything he does gets ones blood going. Gary has essentially taken that energy and put it in book form. This book is great to get you motivated to wan to work hard on your business. This book gives you great suggestions on areas to research to try to kick start your business in this (is it still?) new digital age. This book will not tell you the steps to take to get right into the thick of it and \\"Crush it\\".    I have to say that I would still recommend this book. It is an easy read and the practical advice is very sound. Just don't expect that you are being handed a blueprint to success.
B00009P1O2|5.0|As a long-time Queen fan, I have been searching for the best of the best. Although Montreal/Live Aid in Blue Ray is highly rated, and includes a great performance at Live-Aid, I found it just ok, even considering the detail in the Blue Ray, as it had limited content and Freddie was in a bad mood (and it showed in his performance), as he was annoyed with this camera crew in his face. (This was written about in several books on him). Wembly showed a more relaxed, into it, Freddie, a larger song collection and better additional video including an interview with the band members at Wembly. I feel it is one of the most candid interviews with Freddie, a private man, who elected not to give them. You saw Freddie's character in that interview and his chain-smoking habit. This, along with out-of-publication, Mercury and Me, sit the highest in my collection.
0345440900|4.0|We have nine month old fraternal twins.  They haven't sleep the entire night more than ten times (in nine months), and by the entire night I mean from 10PM to 6AM.  At our nine month doctor appointment, it was suggested that we read this book.  Skeptically, I did (I mean, I've read seven books so far on the subject of sleep).  While reading and making notes (yes, I'm that much of a geek), I realized that I was like so many of her example parents, I have done so many things that seemed like they should work - shushing, patting on the bottom, rocking, swaying, letting my Little Miss fall asleep in my arms.  Desperate for sleep, we put Tracy's methodology to work that day that I read the book.      Finally, my babies that rarely slept more than 1/2 hour during the day, are now sleeping almost an hour (granted, I'm still coaching them through that hour to fall back asleep).  Last night, the babies slept from 8:00 to 5:00 (remember we just had daylight savings change this week).    Best of all today is only DAY TWO!!!!!    Like most methods, this requires a lot of time and patience.  I started wearing a watch, because it felt like I'd be PU/PD'ing for more than an hour, when it's really only been half that.  The worst part is the screaming and crying, it's just so painful to watch.  Sometimes it seems like they are never going to  go to fall back asleep and then, finally they do.  Of course, by the time they finally fall back asleep it's almost time to wake them up.
6300182355|4.0|Not for everyone's taste, this B movie is geared to those of us who are into cult flicks. It is a surreal, disconnected, series of events with great eye candy, really bad acting (so bad it's funny), all blanketed in Queen. Being the Queen fan I am, it added nicely to this bizzare movie and the main reason I bought it. With the exception of the Queen connection which brought me to the movie (I was unsure about this film as I never heard of it and did not want to spend a lot) so I bought this in vcr tape format. It was fine, satisfying my Queen addiction and cult movie taste, especially for the price and shipping costs that still kept it under $5. I liked it enough to consider some day plunking down more serious cash to get the DVD version.
B002ZG99CM|5.0|I loved this movie but to be fair none of the Karate Kids were ever Karate Kids save the evil blond boy from the first movie.  The first Karate Kid was doing more Kung Fu than any thing and in this movie and and story involving being trained by Jacky Chan is a story of learning from a master at Tai Kwon Do / Kung Fu and mixed martial arts with crazy acrobatics thrown in for good measure. Also the pose on the front of the box is as classic Tai Kwon Do as you can get.  Jacky Chan offhandedly explained the meaning of Kung Fu which is \\"Hard Work\\".  This is a great story and pays tribute to the original. Five stars.
B003WTE886|2.0|I actually like some Taylor Swift songs.  Yes, it's true she is nowhere near Carrie or Miranda vocally, and live she definitely needs to work on her tone.  But, on record she doesn't stretch her voice farther than it goes, which can't be said for some other artists.  Fearless contained so many great songs.  Love Story, the title track, White Horse are among my favorites from that disc.  I was looking forward to Speak Now.    I do feel disappointed.  She has some good tracks:  Back to December, Haunted, Better Than Revenge, Mine.  But overall, the songs sound similar.  There are lots of cliche's.  And while yes, it's awesome she wrote the album herself (although her gloating about it where she was patting herself on the back is a bit much), without cowriters to help her some of the songs come out as hollow.  She also comes across as cocky in a few of the songs, not an appealing trait for country music's IT girl.  Her vocals on this album for the most part are fine, although a few times she gets caught doing some vocal gymnastics her voice really isn't suited for.    For those expecting a country album, this is not it.  This is her version of Faith Hill's \\"Cry\\" album.  She is departing country music with this.  It will be interesting to see if the industry turns on her like they did with Faith.  \\"Mine\\" did well at radio, so so far it hasn't hurt her.    My advice:  Skip buying the whole CD.  Instead, sample some tracks and buy those.  Better Than Revenhe, Haunted,Mine, Back to December, Enchanted.  Those are good downloads.
B004132HZS|4.0|This was one concept that could have gone either way. It had to be done right or risk turning up noses in droves. I admit to being as wowed as most everyone else at the writing, casting, photography, and execution of this project. We collectively await more. The DVD contains the three episodes with a caveat, there are moments edited out of the TV airings that are included here. I have mixed feelings about that. I was one of the people who found the television versions edited with razor like PERFECTION and so I am not sure yet what to make of the additions to the DVD. Some instances they strike me as more successful than others but this is a minor concern in an otherwise solid package worth investing in and adding to one's collection. The added moments are small in number thankfully but I would have advised to stick to what PBS aired on television. In addition to an extra feature discussing the making of the series they have included the original pilot of Study in Pink made for the BBC that got them hooked on it and requesting a 90 minute version. The 60 minute version is a bit like watching a stage play and sometimes markedly differs in comparison to the full 90 minute episode and is interesting as an addition. But, this Sherlock shows tremendous promise and I really like it. Next time, stick to one edited version for DVD distribution and television airing.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|I am a sucker for psychological thrillers but prefer to watch them in the comfort of my home where I can jump and scream in peace.  We went to an early showing & thankfully had the theater to ourselves.  I would've made a fool out of myself finger tapping, knee knocking, making commments and in the basement scene, screaming like a banshee.  I love a good mind um...screw?  Doors slamming, kitchen cupboards exploding and moreso the things you couldn't see and let your mind go nuts on were the best parts.  We loved how this was both a sequel and a prequel which tied the first one together beautifully.  It was nice to see a good \\"horror\\" movie that doesn't rely on the cheap, obvious gory bloodfest to scare people.  The things your mind fills in are far more terrifying.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|... in poverty-stricken rural white America, any more than in the black ghettoes of Detroit, or the brown barrios of Miami. And what do those diverse places share? Drugs! Pot-growing, methamphetamine cooking, crack and crank, drug selling, attended with desperation and violence. Drug addiction is not just a big city problem, and in fact it's not a problem limited to the outcasts, misfits, deadbeats, and indocumentados. There are plenty of big shot and fat cat users whose buying power fuels the gang wars of Mexico and funds the Taliban. And the 'moral turpitude' of the narcotics business isn't any more characteristic of liberals than of reactionaries, Blue States than Red, atheists than fundamentalists. In fact, statistics suggest that the fastest growing drug problem in the USA is meth addiction in socially conservative small towns in parts of the country that are supposed to be apple-pie wholesome and old-fashioned in values, towns where your image of the American Dream would include a white steepled church.<br /><br />\\"Winter's Bone\\" is about an impoverished 'community' in the Missouri Ozarks, where all the men are up to their tailbones in drugs not only using them but 'cooking' them. Even those on the the \\"other team\\" -- the sheriff, the bail bondsmen, etc. -- in a sense depend on drugs indirectly, and exhibit the same angry out-for-themselves immorality. Jessup Dolly, a tough customer even by the standards of his hard-bitten hill-folk clan, has disappeared just a few days before his scheduled trial for drug production. The problem is that he posted bail using the title to his shabby house and the scrub forest lot around it. His seventeen-year-old daughter, Ree, is informed that if Jessup skips his court appointment, the family will be evicted from their home. Ree's mother is already suffering a psychotic withdrawal, and there are two younger children in Ree's care as well. Ree goes looking for her father, despite the warnings of her closest kin and neighbors that finding him will be mortally dangerous. Ree turns out to be determined, intrepid, tough -- a \\"Dolly bred and buttered\\" as she says. What she finds eventually is not pleasant.<br /><br />But \\"Winter's Bone\\" is not just about drug violence and a brave girl solving a mystery. Really it's more about concepts of loyalty, honor, and family cohesiveness. Nearly everyone in Ree's world is related to her by blood, and \\"blood\\" is supposed to be thicker than money or law. Ree learns that it isn't, and then again it is. \\"Honor\\" in her language means absolute solidarity against all outsiders. Ree's survival depends on the degree to which her neighbors are certain that she's \\"a girl who won't tell nothing to nobody.\\"<br /><br />Actress Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree Dolly perfectly. John Hawkes is equally convincing as Jessup's fierce, scrawny older brother. Honestly, everyone in the cast of this film is \\"real\\" in his or her role.

Good dialogue, good camera work, good editing produce a film that deserved the \\"Best Picture\\" award it won at the 2010 Sundance Festival.<br /><br />That's well and good, but my own 5-star enthusiasm for this film results from its realism as a fictional documentary of one portion of the America \\"we\\" live in.

1439107955|5.0|You remember the scene in the film \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\"?  From the top of the bluff looking into the distance at dusk, Butch sees the lights of the pursuing posse which doesn't stop tracking them even at night and says \\"How many are following us?  They're beginning to get on my nerves.  Who are those guys?\\"  In the same threatening way cancers have been dogging human beings  since the dawn of time, and although we now know quite a lot about cancer we still don't really know \\"who are those guys\\" or how to shake them.  And they sure are \\"beginning to get on our nerves\\" as Butch said.  Almost one out of four of us will eventually wrestle with cancer --  the defining illness of our generation -- and lose our lives in the process.  Until it catches up with us  most of us will try to ignore this fact, just as when we were very young children alone in our bedroom trying to go to sleep at night we tried to ignore the monster that we sometimes feared might be lurking in our bedroom closet.<br /><br />Enter oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee who almost parentally takes us by the hand to give us the courage to open with him the door to that dark and foreboding closet in order to see what is really lurking inside.  Since eventually most of us are going to have to wrestle with this monster anyway --  either as a victim or as a loved one of a victim -- looking intelligently and closely into that dark closet does diminish fear and enhance wise perspective.  And on this incredible journey into the depths of that darkness, what an absolutely marvelous guide is this modern day Virgil called Siddharta Mukherjee as he leads us on this long and often harrowing journey through the swarth that cancer has cut through mankind throughout time.<br /><br />Mukherjee is a veritable kaleidoscope.  Turn his writing one way and you experience him as an exciting writer of page-turning detective stories or mystery stories; turn him another and he's a highly effective communicator of cellular biology; turn him a third and you get superb science writing; turn him a fourth and he has the grandeur and broad sweep of an excellent historian.  It's hard to believe that this one book, combining all of these appealing characteristics, is the work of just one man.  And underlying it all is his sterling medical training and credentials which have been enumerated often elsewhere.<br /><br />The book itself is a tour de force.  It is the first book of such extraordinary scope regarding cancer.  Its architectural structure brings to mind Melville's Moby Dick and how effectively and artfully Melville braided together the three strands of his great classic: a grand adventure story, the technology of whaling, and a treatise of humanity and philosophy.  Equally effectively does Mukherjee weave together all the various facets of this iconic disease throughout history, from describing cancer from the patient's perspective, to viewing the never ending battles of physicians and medical researchers with cancer over the centuries, to examining the mysteries of the cellular nature of cancer itself and what really goes on in there, to the pro and con impact of this never ending plague on the spirit of the individual human and on our race as a whole, to peering into a crystal ball for a glance of cancer's and our future together.  While doing all of this the alchemy of Mukherjee's writing continually turns science into poetry and poetry into science.<br /><br />Simply put, it is so good, and so incandescently clear and lucid, and so powerful, and so engrossing, and so easily consumed that you will not lay it down without someone or circumstances forcing you to.<br /><br />Had I read this book in my teens I would have found my life's career.  I can only imagine that while you are reading this book, somewhere there will be some very young teenage girl or boy who will also be reading it at the same time you are, and who will become totally hooked by this book just as you willbe, and who will go on to make a career in cancer research, a career that might provide the breakthrough that humanity has been searching and hoping for all of these many centuries.  Thus although you will never know it, you will have \\"been there\\" at the initial motivation of that person and thus indirectly present at the earliest genesis of the eventual great idea.<br /><br />This book has THAT potential.  It is THAT good.<br /><br />Kenneth E. MacWilliamser in cancer research, a career that might provide the breakthrough that humanity has been searching and hoping for all of these many centuries.

0307591549|5.0|While I expected to learn a few cool tips and tricks about weaving positive thinking into one's professional life, I was surprised to find that Shawn Achor's book managed to crack my mind open to new ways of examining and understanding how I engage with my own career. It was a quick  and compelling read full of exciting insights from understanding Nueroplasticity to seeing the sculpture trapped in the marble like Pgymalion to mining the virtues of Tetris. A decade from now, we'll all look back and call this book a seminal work at the start of a cultural evolution. I highlighted tons of passages and took copious notes (most of which were new ideas about my own work and life that were set free while reading). New possibilities have opened up for me as a result of reading \\"The Happiness Advantage\\".
B003YOMNCM|5.0|After seeing Hahn perform the Higdon concerto live with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, I eagerly awaited this recording.  Hahn is masterful in executing both the Tchaikovsky and Higdon concertos, and is a great example to all orchestral musicians of programming classics while playing new compositions that challenge the listener as well as the performer.  I truly have enjoyed this CD!

B0014L5Z18|5.0|Tarja is truly gifted with just about the most amazing voice I have ever heard - anywhere. On this album, she blends it seamlessly with both orchestral and heavy rock, and everything in between to create a truly unique sound that simply must be heard. It's a beautiful yet eclectic mix of wonderful. This was intended as a \\"story album\\", which means that the songs flow one into each other, and put together a cohesive theme that progresses throughout the album. As such, it's not as good on random or individual songs as it is to sit down and listen through the whole album. Tarja will stir your musical emotions as few albums ever will be able to. Highly recommended.

It was very, very hard and challenging at first and i fealt that i am going to die after i was done, but over time, you do get stronger and it gets easier to get through them. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is trying to lose weight or stay in shape. The best DVD i ever owned!!!!!!It is very cheap too and you don't have to pay monthly fees for the gym as you can workout at home, stay in shape  and save money as well!

B001IBIHQ4|3.0|After I watched Band of Brothers, I thought \\"I hope they do the same thing for the Pacific...\\" Because Band of Brothers is the best WWII movie in my book. I wanted to see what they could do with the war in the Pacific. When I read that The Pacific was being developed, I was overwhelmed with excitement.     Having now watched The Pacific, that excitement has transformed to 'eh.'    The Pacific surpasses Band of Brothers in one, and only one, aspect of film making; special effects. That's it. Story telling, character development, acting...Band of Brothers is by far the better production. That isn't to say that The Pacific is not good, it is, but I was expecting more...and expecting less sex, and obscene language. Granted, the language present in The Pacific is likely a watered down version of reality. At the same time, I'm watching The Pacific for entertainment, and I don't really enjoy an abundance of obscene language. In the Band of Brothers, obscene language was present, but it was used in a manner that was not distracting. As for the sex...I don't need to see it, and I don't think it adds anything to the story. (I'm a 27 year old man; I'm not a prude. I just enjoy good film making, and I don't think sex or an abundance of obscene language adds anything to films.). Love scenes could have easily been implied, and the film wouldn't have skipped a beat.    I also thought the gore was a bit much too. When you see a soldiers leg get blown off several times, or a man attempting to put his guts back in, and the only purpose of the shot is to show that...it's cliche. It's Spielberg pulling from his Saving Private Ryan experience. Obviously, it's war and war is violent; but I thought it distracted from the story a bit.    I'm not a historian, so I cannot comment about the accuracy of the film. However, there really isn't much lead up to major battles. In Band of Brothers, there were two episodes that led up to D-Day. Halfway into the first episode of The Pacific, that battle has begun. That sort of sums up the film...nothing really develops, it just happens; and that goes for the characters too.    Band of Brothers did an excellent job of character development. Each character had a personality that was uniqe...I cared what happened to the characters. Not so much in The Pacific. They all play sort of a rough and tough role.     Overall, I thought The Pacific had good moments, and had some just OK moments. Band of Brothers is by far a better film in my book. I'd give Band of Brothers a 10, and The Pacific a 6.5.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Pretty much the same as everyone elses negative reviews.  I really loved this movie but I am dead sick of this milking strategy (ala Lord of the Rings/Star Wars etc..) where they bring out a crippled version (eg flat theater version with nothing) then once all the suckers (eg the actual fans) buy that version they bring out yet another version (then the suckers race out and buy it again) then another version which the die hard suckers and people who don't care that much go out and buy it.   So who loses here... well everyone eventually..   Firstly, the customers because the biggest fans end up with the crappiest versions of the film or they are out of pocket upward of $100 bucks if they buy every version (ive been guilty of this on other movies).   Secondly the studios.  Sure they get the quick fix of multiple cash payments but eventually people learn the behavior and then go well stuff that I'll bit torrent it and buy it later.  They of course never do because once you have it, its hard to justify paying for it again when you got it for free.     Here is a suggestion why don't you bring the best version out at a premium price for a short time then bring out the crippled version later for the discount price.  That way people who pay more (and show support for the studio) get some VALUE for their bigger out lay.   People who only want the standard version can wait and get it for a cheaper price for less features at a later date.   You never know some might go out and buy the expensive version anyway.
B0040JHNZ2|2.0|I love Ken Follett novels because of the combination of vivid narrative and vivid characterization. Sadly in FALL OF GIANTS the narrative - on such an epic, wide-ranging scale - totally takes over. The characters are puppets - chess pieces moving over this immense landscape, serving as illustrations of the historical events, but never coming alive in themselves. What distinguishes Bill from Gregori or Walter from Gus or Ethel from Maud except a few physical details and ideological differences? I didnt feel I knew them any better at the end of this 900 plus pager. But I DID know my history better, and was able to contextualise what happened in Russia with what was going on in America, what the common man felt about both the war and the social order, and the impact of the war on the women's movement. It was good to have the German perspective on the war, as well as the incredible folly of the post-war peacemaking that lead inevitably to World War II. The futility and anguish and unending fatalities of 4 years of trench warfare come through achingly too.
B004B8RXQQ|5.0|I have been a Sherlock & Watson fan for many, many moons now and I like them all...mostly. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, Sir Ben Kingsley and Sir Michael Caine(one of the very funny ones), Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman, Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law, even Hugh Laurie and Robert Sean Leonard. All of them well done in my opinion.<br /><br />This version is set in modern day London and I am thrilled to see the source material alive and well in this series. As of this writing I have only seen the first three but I have signed up for the season pass and am looking forward to many more episodes with these two new Holmes and Watson.<br /><br />Watch it for yourself and make up your own minds.

B003102JDM|3.0|I've been a fan of the Coen brothers since \\"Blood Simple\\".  They're always reinventing themselves and even if I don't care much for the result I'm always eager for their next offering.  \\"A Serious Man\\" isn't one of their better films.  Yes there are some inspired moments here but on the whole this is a case of style over substance.  I was intrigued by the idea of them exploring the Midwestern American Jewish experience, which may have an element of autobiography for the Coens, but this exercise left me cold.  The best you can say about the film is the performance of Michael Stuhlbarg as the harried physics professor.  Stuhlbarg is a breath of fresh air and humanity in what is basically an antiseptic affair.  Here's hoping the Coens get back on their game the next time.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|haha, JK, but seriously, this shows that, although a good singer, he was overrated for his importance to this band.  This is Cantrell's show and he continues to produce awesome rock and roll!  Duvall is great and the band sounds crisp with varied tunes and some instant classic rock songs.    Love it!!!      Buy it.  Enjoy it.  Don't diss Layne but, admit it, he is NOT what made Alice great.  Cantrell is a student of rock; gifted and creative.      Thank you :)    Tracks to LOVE:  1.  All Secrets Known  2.  Check My Brain  3.  Your Decision  4.  Lesson Learned  5.  Last of My Kind  6.  Take Her out Again    That's a lot of AWESOME tracks on an 11 Track album, haha!

B003XSSR4W|5.0|\\"Straight Up,\\" the third album from Badfinger has been remastered and re-released by Apple Records, both on CD and (finally) as a digital download.  The sound quality is simply amazing bringing a whole new aural clarity to a classic album.  This should have been the album that finally elevated Badfinger to commercial success.  Four songs, including the single \\"Day After Day\\" written by guitarist Pete Ham were produced by George Harrison (who played slide guitar on the track).  The remaining eight tracks were produced by Todd Rundgren.  While most will recognize the aforementioned \\"Day After Day,\\" \\"Baby Blue\\" (also a Ham track) still receives radio airplay throughout the US.  The re-mastering was completed by the staff of engineers who remastered the Beatles catalog released last year and they have continued their stellar work.  Sadly, Badfinger never got the breaks they certainly deserved.  The combination of the Beatles crumbling Apple empire and the band's criminal management who literally stole almost every dime the band made eventually led to Ham's suicide in 1975 and the suicide of bassist Tom Evans in 1983.  Still, the remastered \\"Straight Up\\" album is a great legacy for one of the original power pop bands.  Without Badfinger, the genre may never have developed and sustained itself over the last almost forty years.  Listen and enjoy.    As a side note, if you are a Badfinger completest, purchase the digital download bonus tracks that are not available on the CD.  With all of the \\"Straight Up\\" bonus tracks, one can compile the first version of \\"Straight Up\\" that was rejected by Apple Records and never released.  The running order for that album is:    Suitcase (Earlier Version)  I'll Be the One  No Good At All (Previously Unreleased)  Sweet Tuesday Morning (Earlier Version)  Baby Please (Previously Unreleased)  Mean Mean Jemima (2010 Remaster)  Name of the Game (Earlier Version)  Loving You (2010 Remaster)  Money (Earlier Version - 2010 Remaster)  Flying (Earlier Version - 2010 Remaster)  Sing For the Song (Previously unreleased)  Perfection (Earlier Version - 2010 Remaster)    These tracks were produced and mixed by Geoff Emerick who produced the band's previous album, \\"No Dice.\\" While not as strong as the eventual release, the unreleased album is fun to listen to when one knows how these songs evolved into the eventual masterpiece.

B000006TRV|1.0|Greetings to everyone at Amazon.com    I received the album Pink Floyd The Wall a while ago and listened to it immediately when I got it and saw a big error, that probably came from the cd printing company... there are 2 cds, the first one is good, nothing wrong with it exeptthe second one.. its a Beatles cd, like the Beatles movie soundtrack....so I figured it must have been a misprint of some sort and probably those 2 bands are with the same label so they mixed it up when printing. There must be many more of the same kind in wich you are selling and probably other customers had had the same experience as me, so maybe check that out!    ps. I guess its to late to get a refund for that double disc and I respect that, its my fault, but check that out carefully.    Cheers!    Chad
B003VIW8DK|5.0|The Golden Voice is back.    In a year when big names have reappeared after search parties had long given up hope, only to deliver the worst album of their respective careers (Sade, Peter Gabriel), Bryan Ferry's first album of new material in eight years shows that he's as fresh and relevant as ever.    While rumors of this album swirled like so many of the dizzying performances of the several guitarists who would eventually play on it, there seemed reason for concern.  Ferry started courting the European club crowd, and in 2009 he was the lead vocalist on an endless ten minute European \\"club hit\\" by DJ Hell.  And then word came that he'd also soon be working with Groove Armada, Scissor Sisters, Flea, Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood.   There was a whiff of desperation.  One wondered if Ferry were trying too hard.  And if so, why should he have to?  It's often been a head-scratcher as to why Ferry isn't a household name in the States, much less inducted in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame (which remains doubly insipid without him in it).   It's long been music's Golden Ticket just to be asked to appear on a Ferry album; Bete Noire, his final album of the 1980s featured over forty musicians (but in the 1980s Ferry was a man whose every move was written about in all caps).      The star-studded Olympia (even Kate Moss has a role as a femme fatale on the album cover) opens up with the unmistakable first seven seconds of Roxy Music's gorgeous swan song, \\"True to Life.\\"  But that elegiac tone is quickly disposed of and \\"You Can Dance\\" digs right in, trying to force its way into your head.   This is new ground, because Ferry's music--like the man himself--has always made inroads with nothing but grace and élan.  The insistence of the song is a bit jarring at first, but patience is rewarded.  The groove is so thick and layered that this song becomes the best piece of black clothing in your wardrobe.    The next track, \\"Alphaville,\\" is vintage Ferry through and through.  From thefaint female dialogue at the start, to the swirling Eno orchestration of the song, and of course that voice--that iconic, quivering, wavering, tapered voice--that loves tracks full of mysteries and insinuations, all in the service of lines like \\"I'm hungry for your lies/Your screams and whispers.\\"      The much-talked about collaboration with Scissor Sisters, \\"Heartache By Numbers,\\" has a lighter canvas than one is used to in Ferry's later work.  But it's also got a lovely thumping beat and only the bridge toward song's end is a misstep; it goes for pop when it should have gone for nocturne.    \\"Me Oh My,\\" is emblematic twilight Ferry; smoldering and hesitating, it's a bedraggled lothario trawling the night for one last fix.  Love, we all know by now, is Ferry's drug.  The cliché fits because as much as Presley owned the hip shake, Jagger owns the prance, Dylan owns the mumble, and Cohen owns the dark humor, Ferry owns the persona of the handsome stranger, left outside of too many of life's more decadent obligations.  He is after all the man responsible for one of the greatest lines in music, 1973's purr to an inflatable doll: \\"I blew up your body/But you blew my mind.\\"      The club-friendly Groove Armada collaboration, \\"Shameless,\\" has a shimmer and a bravado that gives the record another jolt of exuberance.  And it's a nice lift before the second act which begins with a cover of Tim Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren.\\"  In addition to guitar work from the wisely-chosen Nile Rodgers and Oliver Thompson, the three other guitarists on this one track--David Gilmour, Phil Manzanera, and Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood--all combine to create a near-trance inducing ode to . . . a Roxy Music album?  One can't listen to this song without thinking of 1975's Siren.  It is a triumphant instruction on how to cover someone else's work.  The loveliness of the song is so incantatory, that it carries the listener over the next two tracks: the slighty-lazy AM-radio-friendly cover of Traffic's \\"No Face, No Name, No Number,\\" and the funk desires of the album's real clunker, \\"BF Bass (Ode to Olympia).\\"  The title alone of the latter track makes one suspect Ferry of trying a bit too hard, and then the passing reference to Facebook, and the insistent chorus of \\"Love, love, you fit me like a glove\\" only confirms as much.      But Ferry, is of course, an artist of the highest order; he would never end an album on a reaching note.  For Roxy Music's legendary final album, Avalon, he famously took the trademark starlet pin-up down from the cover, draped heavy velvets over every inch of her exposed flesh before having her turn her back to the camera while Ferry himself orchestrated the album's funereal fadeout, \\"Tara.\\"  And three years later, in his masterpiece Boys and Girls he ended with the title track's final rip of the drum, letting it echo through the empty streets at nighttime, searching for those last two lovers who had strolled the shimmering sidewalks but had yet to succumb to Ferry's curfew of bedrooms and hotel suites.     \\"Olympia\\" offers as fine a closing one-two punch as anything since Kate Bush's \\"Nocturn\\" and \\"Aerial\\" roared into Aerial's ether in 2005.  \\"Reason or Rhyme\\" is Ferry at his most touching and ethereal.  Its sparse lyric and dreamy atmospherics reminds one of Avalon's \\"The Space Between.\\"  The difference now is that Ferry is sixty-five and when he sings \\"Why must you shed such tender tears/In the evening of your years?\\" the question is urgent, the voice is vulnerable, the answer necessary.   It is a gorgeous trance-inducing seven minutes that, in a strange way, resets the tone of the album and lays out the carpet for the F. Scott Fitzgerald finale, \\"Tender is the Night.\\"    This quiet, gorgeous ballad starts with the smooth buzz of a dial spanning the frequency spectrum of an old radio.  A piano soon takes over and the hushed immediacy of Ferry's vocals reminds you that it's as great a musical instrument as we have across the musical landscape.  The song has a decadent whiff of nostalgia to it, as if the song itself is proof that grown men do in fact spend summers along the east coast, the grassy hillocks tinting their bare feet green; that these characters are real and not just the imaginings of an elegantly choreographed photo shoot for a preppy summer line of an eponymous brand of clothing.  \\"It makes no sense,\\" Ferry sings, \\"you think of me/out of place/in your society/I wanna be where strangers meet/I wanna hold you at the dark end of the street.\\"  And so the genius again has hit his marks.  He's earned the Fitzgeraldian title of the song as he paints as fine an image possible of the struggle of love among society's clashing social circles.  The song is so hypnotic in its movement, that the listener is able to conjure the Shakespearean moths, the bothery mosquitoes, and the once-envious fireflies as they form their exodus from the \\"dark end of the street\\" where a couple is locked in an embrace, the street quiet and tender, the only movement is the slow sway of the glass casing of the streetlight that has been left open while its removed bulb is cradled for the moment in the woman's purse.

142311339X|4.0|When I first entered the world of the Olympians in The Lightning Thief, I was pleasantly surprised.  I picked it up one day at the book store.  Thumbing through the first page of the book, I said, \\"I'll give it a whirl.\\"  Though I'm not a big fan of the \\"writer's point of view\\" I found myself finishing the book wanting more.      I quickly went out and bought Sea of Monsters, Titan's Curse, and Battle of the Labyrinth and through the course of two weeks finished those as well.  I completely forgot about The Last Olympian until I walked into the bookstore after having been away for over a month.  I grabbed the last one and in the course of two days (No more than six hours of reading) finished the final installment.  Though there are some menial typing errors throughout the series, I think the Percy Jackson series is overall a good read.      The first installment of the Olympians Series is no exception.  Right from the start I was excited with the change of writing style and with the introduction of new characters.  They have they're own story and I am very excited to see how it unfolds.  Keeping to his word, Mr Riordan has also given us a chance to revisit some old faces and names.  Though this particular story will be mainly about new characters, it seems the old characters will certainly have a roll to play.      Though there, I found less menial mistakes the first read through.  I have not picked it back up since, but most likely will in the near future.  I would recommend this title to anyone looking for more from The Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.  Anyone interested in Greek Mythology my also find this interesting.  At the very least, one can appreciate the time spent ensuring that the Greek myths were as close to accurate as humanly possible.  I give this book a four out of five stars.
0812550706|5.0|I am not a science fiction reader...as an 8th grade teacher, I actually read this with students for an advanced class of readers because it was on the reading list left from the teacher before me...however, I found, that from the beginning to the end of this book (and then the entire series) I loved Ender and the other characters.  As a studying counselor, I found it impossible to not feel the heart of this young hero who was willing to do whatever it would take to help others survive, but was always able to keep the right motivation.    It is the overarching story of understanding, connection, and empathy that comes through the characters, demonstrating that even in their flawed condition, they can still be good.  This is a thematically brilliant story that just happens to be set in the science fiction arena.  The sequels only get stronger, and the reader is always able to keep the connection to Ender; Card never looses sight of his brilliant understanding of humanity and unconditional love.
1451532512|4.0|William Shakespeare:  The Tempest<br /> The tempest is a play written in the 17th century by William Shakespeare. This is the last play was written by him, except collaborations. The last known performance for this play by Shakespeare himself was at the time of King James for his daughter, Princess Elizabeth in 1613. The same year Shakespeare wrote this play, crew sent by the king to Bermuda Island of the Caribbean was destroyed by a violent tornado, also known as a tempest. Most of the historians say that Shakespeare got the idea of The Tempest from this event. However, The Tempest is about more than the weather; it is about revenge, love, and comedy.<br /> The play starts when Prospero, the main character and a sorcerer, and Miranda, Prospero's daughter, find a shipwreck on Prospero's isolated island in the Mediterranean. Prospero starts telling his daughter about how he was a king one day and his brother, Antonio, in concert with Alonso, king of Naples in Italy, usurped him, forcing him to flee in a boat with his daughter to this isolated island. However, while Prospero's brother was traveling through the Mediterranean Sea to Tunisia for his daughter's wedding, Prospero made a tempest to destroy their boat and lead them to his island. On this ship there was Ferdinand, Alonso, Antonio, Sebastian, Gonzalo, Trinculo & Stephano, and the boatswain.<br /> From this point, the actual play starts. The whole plot is that Prospero wants to take his revenge on Antonio and Alonso. There is much work he has to do to make sure that his revenge will be successful. First he has to make his daughter marry Ferdinand, son of Alonso, to make sure that his daughter is related to the crown. Second he must show his magician power to his enemies, the crew.<br /> Prospero had two servants, Caliban, not a full human, and Ariel, who was a ghost imprisoned in a tree by Sycorax and was released by Prospero. It is true that Prospero enslave Ariel but he promised him that if he stopped complaining and did his work very well he would be released. Prospero used Ariel for magic tricks, because nobody can see a ghost and Caliban for physical work, such as getting wood.<br /> Now that everybody is in the island, everyone wants to achieve his purpose. Prospero wants to take revenge, Miranda trying to marry Ferdinand, the crew hoping to return back to Italy, Ariel wants his freedom, and Caliban fighting to be the king of this island.<br /> The end of the play wasn't as everybody expected. Everybody reached his goal, but it wasn't the same goal that he planned to achieve from the first place. Some of the character's ending were funny, some of them were just normal. However, every character were satisfied at the end.<br /> The tempest was written very perfectly in that it can be performed as a drama, comedy, tragedy, or fantasy play. There were two genres in this play, Pastoral and Romance. Also, it has a mixture of serious events and comic scenes that made it such a complex and perfect performance. The characters in the plays were both, High and low ranked characters. Even the high ranked characters were low in some scenes and vice versa.<br /> The setting of this play was always on the island and the boat. Even though the shipwrecked and exiles characters mentioned returning back to Italy, they still didn't show it in the performance. The costumes of this play were very varied and perfect. Even though this play is great, it has a negative aspect. This is that the play was written about 400 hundred years ago. Therefore, the language used back then is hard to understand in our contemporary world.<br /> This play has two genres, the first one is pastoral. This genre shows us how a crown such as Ferdinand marries Miranda, who lived her whole life working to survive on an isolated island with her old father. It also shows corruption versus innocence. Ferdinand, son of the betrayer, marries Miranda, the innocent lady, the girl with a lack of experience due to her isolated life. The play was performed in London which was a pretty modern city at that time. This made the contrast between the urban world and natural realm of the island a key theme and people have nostalgia to their old natural world. Also, it was one of the first plays to talk about love in the woods, on a forsaken island.<br /> The second genre is romance. It shows us that Ferdinand was working so hard for Prospero just to win the love of his daughter Miranda. Caliban did the same thing with Miranda, but he was cursed to work for her father just because he was a low ranked person. Therefore, Ferdinand is working to gain something, but Caliban is working because he was forced to work for Prospero. So the romance in this era depends on the person's rank in the society. For an example, Ferdinand married Miranda because both of them have noble bloods. At that time they believed that the nobles were born to marry other nobles.<br /> Despite that this play looks at fantasy, magic ghosts, and drama, it has a comedic aspect as well. For example, Miranda marries the first man she can marry, which is Ferdinand; because Caliban wasn't a \\"full human\\". Another example is that after all the things that the crew did for Prospero, he just forgives them and they all return back to Italy. This was one of Shakespeare's techniques; to add comic scenes to the play to make it possible to be performed as a comedic performance. That why it considered a complex and hard-to-copy-from.<br /> The people's ranking in this play was changing. For example, Prospero was a high ranked king in Milan. Then he was sent to an isolated island to be low ranked person who worked for his living. But then, at the end of the play he returns to Milan as a king. Therefore he became a high ranked person again. Everyone in this play was in the same situation. Ferdinand, the crown of Naples, served as a Lumberjack for Prospero and even his father, the King of Naples, was complaining about lack of food.<br /> At that time when it was performed in London,  Inigo Jones was the one who made their costumes and background themes. Inigo was Welsh but he was considered the best architect in England back then. Also, Inigo was credited with introducing movable scenery and the proscenium arch to England. Therefore, this play considered multi-perfect; because the writer is Shakespeare and the architect is Inigo.<br /> The negative aspect in this play is that it's written in old English. Even though it has been translated to modern English language, it still has some complex and classy words. These words cannot be translated into modern English because it would change the whole meaning or destroy the rhythm in Prospero's spells and the poetic speeches by the characters.<br /> At the end, I would say that this is a very great play and I recommend it not just because Shakespeare wrote it, but also because it was written very artfully. You would like this play weather you prefer fantasy, drama, or comedian plays. I never have seen a play before that contains all these elements. I say two thumbs up for this play.in London which was a pretty modern city at that time.

0307476154|3.0|Having never read the first book in the trilogy, I got hooked by watching the Swedish film, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.\\" One movie reviewer commented that he felt the film \\"tightened up\\" the plot and elminated some unneccesary commentary.  It wasn't until I read \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" that I understood the comment.<br /><br />In summary, this book would have been much more enjoyable as a 500 page novel instead of 700 pages.  It is often worth reading a novel of this size as the author has more time to develop the world he is leading you into.  But in my opinion, the author spent too many pages reviewing the events of the plot.  Like the first couple minutes of a TV series, the author wanted to tell me what I missed in the last episode. It was totally unnecessary and actually interfered with pace of the plot.<br /><br />So, with the negatives out of the way, let me share what I enjoyed most.  It was the writer's ability to weave an interesting and complex story.  This talent became especially apparent after I watched the film version of the 2nd book.  The movie choose to tell the story in logical sequence and lost most of what was interesting in the novel.  What I liked most about the book was the dance between the interior and exterior reality of the characters.  In that it reminded me of one of my favorite novels, \\"Sometimes a Great Notion\\" by Ken Kesey.  It was that weaving of the character's emotions with the events of the plot that made the book an interesting read.  It is unfortunate that the writer won't be around to refine his craft in coming novels.
B0047SF41G|5.0|Just finished watching this movie. Very impressed! I personally watched it because  of Adrien Brody and he didn't let me down, as usual. ;)  The movie itself is very entertaining, fast developing, exciting, I definitely had fun watching it!  Rent it of buy it, you won't regret it!   Awesome movie, awesome played Mr. Brody! Bravo!
031603438X|5.0|When I first ordered this book, I expected yet another rock star autobiography of excessive sex, drugs and rock n roll.  Boy, was I surprised!  The bulk of this book is written from a very intricate muscial prospective.  Yes, the drug use is in there, but it is not the crux of the book.  It's all about the music! I would definitely recomment it.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|1. Looks really nice, sturdy and well built - so 5 * there  2. Does work very well with my Canon and SD cards  3. tried Apple keyboard that came with my iMac but get error message (too much battery draw etc.) - so feel a bit cheated not because Apple promised it but expected it from apple to at least make their own keyboard to work with it, but can understand the battery draw part    I think this is really nice addition although I find it hard to believe that Apple could not have included it in iPad body itself. It is almost a money gouging effort on Apple's part.    however the product itself does what it says and does it well while looking nice and feeling good.
0440219078|4.0|In a world that strives for \\"sameness\\", Jonas literally begins to see things differently.  War and pain have been eliminated, even people's jobs are chosen for them.  To makes an interesting read, a book needs conflict.  Jonas is that conflict.  Just as pre-teen Jonas questions things, the book asks the target audience of young adults to do the same.     The prospect of a world in which every human action becomes robotic has become a reality.  Child rearing is a system controlled by the authoritarian rulers.  Work is only interupted by occaional leisure.  Action is taken without thought. Jonas witnesses a shocking act by his father that completely changes his peception of his world.  Being trained that the Receiver of Memory, Jonas is given information beyond the average person.  He trained as the keeper of knowledge most people will never know.  What he sees haunts him.  As the apprentice to the current receiver, Jonas finds an ally.  He is not the only one uncomfortable with his world.  Jonas seeks to make a change.    Aspects of \\"The Giver\\" are well thought-out.  The characters are developed nicely to fit in the scheme of the plot.  The ending seemed to be rushed and fell short of expectations.  Many readers may not understand the author's choice for an ending.  In the big picture, \\"The Giver\\" is a well-developed read for young adults and adults.
B002OEBMN4|3.0|I bought this record from Amazon on a $5 MP3 special.  I've listened to it at least 30 times since then.  There are some really great musical moments on this offering, I have to say.  The drumming is tip top, too.  I think Americon is the best tune on the record, followed by Human Strain and World Painted Blood.  I like the thrash metal style in limited quanities, so its nice when Slayer drop the metronome for a few bars - then you find out they are actually really creative flexible musicians.<br /><br />But I have a major problem with this record and its the lyrics of the tunes; they are just plain old idiotic.  Why would a grown man want to sing about killing people on most of the tunes?  Doesn't he have a family?  I can understand one or two tunes with this theme, but its one after another and it makes you wonder whether the he's a closet serial killer.<br /><br />If not for the lyrics, this would be a 4 star record - and possibly 5 if they had more variety in the songwriting over all.
B002OOG6YY|3.0|As it was mentioned before, Manson's can clearly be head singing while the microphone was down or his mouth was closed. I don't know if he lip-synched that particular show because of vocal problems (it was one of the last shows on the tour after all) and he half-assed his performance, or it was dubbed in during the editing of the BluRay to fix any mistakes he may have made. The band seems to be playing live so I can't imagine the audio being from a different show(s) (unless the band plays the exact same thing in the exact same way in every show which is highly unlikely). Besides the editing flubs, the concert must've been killer to witness live. I'm sad to say that I was never able to experience Manson in his good years (pre-2007). His latest performances have been terrible and his band is no longer solid. Either drugs have caught up to him or age, but given the fact that his former master, Trent Reznor, is older than he is (albeit slightly) but far surpasses him in music, image and performance, I would say that the drugs have finally caught up and whatever emotional problems Manson has been harboring has finally taken its toll. I hope he gets his act together, move Twiggy back on bass, and start writing some albums with effort. Until then, I'm happy to be able to listen to his good albums and watch old videos of his performances on the internet.     I'm also hoping for an official blu-ray release of a show of his other tours (most notably the Grotesque tour and Against All Gods tour).
1423101472|5.0|I finished the last book in this series feeling really sad that there weren't more books to read. The world and characters created by Riordan felt both authentic and profound. The Greek mythology is certainly delightful, but I also enjoyed how the series reflected some of the problems in the real world, such as how unloved and abandoned children can deeply and negatively affect society as a whole. What I enjoyed most of all though was that the entire series was really fun to read. Highly recommended!
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Spartacus: Blood and Sand relies heavily on the gross-out comic book style of 300. It is filmed entirely within a studio. The story is drawn out to fill the quota of a season of 13 episodes but the characters are well developed and the plots and sub plots interesting, so it never becomes tedious. Compard to the gentler pacing of earlier episodes, the last episode seems a bit hurried with lots of plot loose ends neatly resolved (and one or two not so neatly done, such as that of Doctore).<br /><br />The violence is very graphic and heavily stylised. There is also extensive male and female nudity which is historically accurate regarding that of the gladiators and slaves.<br /><br />The acting is, on the whole, quite good, particularly that of John Hannah and Lucy Lawless. Andy Whitfield is a credible hero and his acting is subtle and effective. Some of the actors in gladiator roles seem to think that gritting teeth and shouting/screaming passes for passionate acting but this is a minor quibble.<br /><br />While it lacks the epic scale and sweep of the two Rome series it is a credible and involving story with quite accurate recreation of how life was in those ancient times.
0060775858|5.0|This book is a bedtime classic, and here's why.  Most children benefit from a bedtime routine.  It's smart to have them do the same things in the same order, as it establishes a pattern that they can count on, all leading towards a good night's sleep.  This book allows a child and their parent to create a pattern of repetition that leads towards sleep.  \\"Goodnight Moon\\" has a cadence and a pattern to it that allows the child to both add to the 'goodnights' as well as participate in the ritual of getting sleepy.
0312997221|4.0|A good book about avenging those wronged by slimeballs. I liked this book even if I did guess the ending. A lot of the plots I did not guess like Cal loosing his wife and child. It's not unusual for 16 year olds to get a hard head as they grow up and embrace life and Cal's daughter and only child was no different. Without giving the story away, suffice it to say, it didn't end well for her, her father nor her mother. Cal made it through difficult times and  seemed to overcome a lot of strife in his lifetime. He was loyal to his friend (the other tunnel rat) and the favor was returned without him even knowing it. But I beleive in revenge and reading this warmed my heart. I simply couldn't put it down.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I have loved \\"Forbidden Planet\\" ever since seeing it as a kid years ago.  I was excited to see it in the Blu-ray format, and I wasn't disappointed.  The film looks spectacular, and the special effects -- state of the art at the time -- still look magnificent.<br /><br />Robby the Robot, of course, came away from this film a huge star, and it's fun to see him again.  You might be interested to know that the voice of Robby is actor Marvin Miller, who played the executive secretary of an eccentric wealthy man who, each week, gave away one million dollars tax-free on the TV show, \\"The Millionaire.\\"<br /><br />Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen (playing it straight... this was well before his days as a comedy star in such films as \\"Airplane!) star.  Included in this release is the feature film, \\"The Invisible Boy,\\" a follow-up film that capitalized on the popularity of Robby the Robot but had nothing to do with \\"Forbidden Planet.\\"<br /><br />A sequel to \\"Forbidden Planet\\" was never made.  This big-budget epic, filmed in color, was MGM's first venture into the then emerging popularity of science fiction.  Most sci-fi pictures of the 1950's were black & white, low-budget efforts.  Only a few were made in color.  This and \\"War of the Worlds\\" are the most famous and best color sci-fi features of the Eisenhower era.

0060775858|5.0|I grew up loving Goodnight Moon as well as some other books by this author and illustrator (Runaway Bunny). It was a childhood classic, and I read the same copy that was read to me, to my children. They never complain, and now that they are older, 7 & 5, they help me either read or finish the sentences. I definitely recommend!

B004BCT2HU|4.0|Typically, David Garrett's concert DVDs are only available in the US through PBS pledge drives. The footage is the same as his German concert DVDs, but the American PBS versions are noticeably shorter than their German counterparts, and \\"Rock Symphonies\\" is no exception. However, this time around Decca has put more thought into the total package. David's first concert DVD seemed rushed into production, lacked any sort of interactive menus, and cut between songs with no warning and frequently no introductions (this was in part due to the fact that most of David's intros are in German for a German audience). On \\"Rock Symphonies,\\" the root menu is the same as the \\"Rock Symphonies\\" album cover, except the grey background rotates clockwise, giving the impression of movement. The \\"Chapters\\" menu features the promo photo of David standing on a rooftop with animated dark clouds sweeping across the sky. The \\"Bonus Features\\" menu is the close-up of David with eyeliner...gorgeous! There are two bonus tracks, \\"Bicycle Race\\" and \\"Live and Let Die.\\" These can only be accessed from the \\"Bonus Features\\" menu and not the full concert, apparently. The \\"Behind the Scenes\\" feature is the same as the North American EPK for \\"Rock Symphonies\\" (just shy of 6 minutes).<br /><br />Sound and picture quality are great (according to the back of the case, it's 5.1 Surround Sound and 2.0 Stereo). The biggest improvement over the PBS [[ASIN:B002D19EFG David Garrett: Live In Berlin]] is that the introductions flow smoothly into the songs, rather than cutting from song to song. There were actually more non-album tracks like \\"Mission Impossible\\", \\"Peer Gynt,' \\"Child's Anthem\\" and \\"Adagio in G Minor\\" than \\"Rock Symphonies\\" tracks (\\"Kashmir,\\" \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" \\"Walk This Way,\\" and \\"Asturias\\"). Minus one star for leaving off David's smokin' cover of Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets,\\" which was hands-down one of the best covers on [[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]]. Australian guitarist Orianthi really rocked out with David on the Michael Jackson medley, which saw David exploring \\"Billy Jean\\" and \\"I'll Be There\\" on the heels of last year's cover of \\"Smooth Criminal.\\" It was also nice to see one song (\\"Zorba's Dance\\") carried over from the [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]] album of last year. However, compared to the German Open Air Live DVD, there are only thirteen tracks (plus the two bonus tracks accessed separately) clocking in at just shy of an hour. It's too bad that they didn't include the studio interviews with David that were filmed as part of the PBS pledge special as bonus materials, seeing as this is a PBS exclusive.<br /><br />Overall, the PBS \\"Rock Symphonies\\" DVD feels like Decca took more care with packaging and designing menus (using hi-res promotional photos from \\"Rock Symphonies\\" and adding animated backgrounds, for example). It's great to hear David add his own unique intros to the songs, like the stories about him being an ersatz drummer at a gig in London, or the story about when he was seventeen and a girl tried to kiss him on the beach. His connection to his fans is obvious...he dedicates one song to a \\"couple in love\\" in the audience, and he positively glows whenever he performs. If you're looking for the full David concert experience, by all means get one of the German versions: there'a a regular, Region 0 2DVD set, ASIN B003V89YT6 and a Blu-Ray version, ASIN B00415Z9Y2 at Amazon.de. With shipping and currency conversion, the German Open Air Live DVDs will run about twice what you'd pay for the US version, but it clocks in at 2 DVDs, 196 minutes and 28 songs total, far more than the 15 (!) on the PBS single-disc version.<br /><br />PBS \\"Rock Symphonies\\" Tracklist: *song NOT in broadcast program<br /><br />1.Kashmir<br />2.Schubert's Serenade<br />3.Smells Like Teen Spirit<br />4.Mission Impossible Theme<br />5.Walk This Way<br />6.Michael Jackson mini-medley -- Billy Jean / I'll Be There<br />7.I'll Stand By You<br />8.Peer Gynt<br/>9.Asturias<br />10.Child's Anthem<br />11.Adagio (Albinoni)<br />12.Zorba<br />13.Hey Jude<br />14.Bicycle Race*<br />15.Live and let Die*<br /><br />German \\"Rock Symphonies: Open Air Live\\" Tracklist:  (ASIN B003V89YT6 and ASIN B00415Z9Y2, Available at Amazon.de)<br /><br />Tracklisting:<br />01.

B000024E9M|5.0|\\"Selling England By the Pound\\" was the first Genesis album I heard and shortly after also bought. It took me a while to get used to the, for that time, rather long and complex songs, but the start of \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" was sufficiently catchy that I initially became interested coming to a better understanding the group's music. It soon proved to be worthwhile, and now many years later, after have bdecome thoroughly acquainted with most of the group's music, I still consider this album as one of their best.<br /><br />The record was a great success for the group in 1973 and some time later the single-track \\"I Know What I Like\\" also became a minor hit. A fun song that shows the group from its humorous side. \\"Firth of Fifth\\" is like the opening track a complex compostion, built  up with different, but very fine musical pieces. The quiet acoustic \\"More Fool Me\\" is a little pre-taste of Genesis with Phil Collins as lead singer.<br /><br />The original side two opened with the album's longest track, the dramatic tale of \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" This is followed by the delicate instrumental \\"After the Ordeal\\" that ends with a majestic guitar solo. \\"The Cinema Show\\" is another long composition, where especially the vocal parts are very melodic and catchy - and which include a sequence where the vocals remind me a lot of Crosby, Stills and Nash. \\"Aisle of Plenty\\" is a little reprise of the \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" theme.<br /><br />Definitely one of Genesis' strongest and most enduring albums.
B002ZG983M|5.0|A classic that will never get old. I am not a big fan of superhero movies like Batman or X-Man. I do like the Spider-Man series - that's only acceptation (& Superhero Movie). Kick-Ass has lots of action scenes and comedic scenes that make the more interesting and hilarious. The only thing I disliked in the movie was Nicolas Cage, he looked like Batman and his acting was dull and annoying, but it didn't ruin the movie. The movie is amazing and a must see.
0316044695|5.0|This book definitely opened my eyes even more to the hard work done by the US Navy Seals, before reading this I never had an idea of the extent of their missions.  Marcus is one amazing narrator I felt as if he was telling me the story personally.  I loved his Texas style and hard Seal persona that came out in his story.  I had the read Seal of Honor before reading this one and am happy I chose both books as my reading for the month.  I have defintely passed on this book to 2 family members already so its a great Christmas gift!!  Enjoy!
B0034G4OY0|4.0|HEREAFTER<br /><br />STARRING: Matt Damon, Cecile De France, Frankie McLaren, George McLaren, Jay Mohr, Bryce Dallas Howard and Richard Kind<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Peter Morgan<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Clint Eastwood<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Drama<br />Release Date: 22 October 2010<br />Review Date: 09 November 2010<br /><br />It's amazing how much Matt Damon and Clint Eastwood give us out of so little, in Hereafter. Eastwood directs Damon for the second time, this time as a psychic named George who can communicate with the loved ones you've lost, just by touching you. The reason I say they give us so much out of so little, is because we never see anything other than Damon's flawless acting.<br /><br />George touches your hands and can instantly sense who has passed in your life and can relay their message to you. What makes Hereafter so likeable is that we believe George can do this, from Damon's performance alone. He's not a quack, he doesn't have an ego about his gift and he's just so terribly convincing that even if we didn't know his as Matt Damon, we'd still find him convincing.<br /><br />And saying he doesn't have an ego about it is an understatement by the way. George hates his so called gift and would sooner refer to it as a curse. His talent has left him in a world of bitter and cold isolation and he's fed up with it. We learn that he once made quite a name for himself and a respectable living but has long since given up on all that and taken a mediocre paying job just to get by.<br /><br />The story isn't only about Damon's character George, but it largely is, and it's the one I found the most enjoyable out of the three that are shown to us.<br /><br />We also meet a lovely French woman named Marie, played by Cecile De France, who has had a near death experience and witnessed a small taste of an afterlife. It should be noted that we will be seeing more of this gifted actress in films to come.<br /><br />The third story is of a set of young twins who do anything and everything together and for one another, until a brutal accident changes their lives forever.<br /><br />We cut back and forth between the three stories, realizing that eventually they will come to a head. They do, and it's marvelously done.<br /><br />But let's go back to the George story. Jay Mohr plays George's brother and is so adamant that George should give his talent a second chance in order to help others - that George just might. In the meantime, he has been taking a cooking class at night and has met the woman of his dreams there: Melanie, played by Bryce Dallas Howard - who by the way had better be the next MJ, in the upcoming Spider-Man reboot. She's perfect for it.<br /><br />These two, meaning Damon and Howard, together in a scene, was simply electrifying. They acted and Eastwood directed them, in some of the best romantic scenes that I have ever seen in a film. It was brilliant because they are both experienced adults, but George has been out of the game for so long that it's almost like high school again for him, and for us watching them. They both want each other, but don't seem too keen at first, as to if the feeling is a mutual one.<br /><br />The scene with the blindfold is a pristine blend of eroticism, romance and temptation, and is directed beautifully by Clint Eastwood. In addition to the acting and the directing, I just really liked the idea of two people falling for one another as partners in a nightly cooking class. Because I was so invested in these moments, I was absolutely riveted with anger at what happens between the two of them, that it nearly split me in two; even though I saw it coming from a mile away.<br /><br />But the movie goes on, and it remains good and ends as originally as it opened. It makes us think, it stimulates us and it entertains us. You should know that it is very slow however, and you need to be ready for that when you sit down to watch it. But if you invest the time and the proper amount of attention, you will not be disappointed. And this is important subject matter folks. If you haven't given thought to what your hereafter holds in store for you -perhaps you should.given thought to what your hereafter holds in store for you -perhaps you should.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I saw this marvelous movie in a theater in San Diego in 1965.  The Blu-Ray edition brings back the original sound and video with a vengeance.  It is beyond belief what the techies did to this musical.  If you have a Blu-Ray DVD Player, buy this version.  You will not regret it.  Teamed with HDTV it is sumptuous.  To answer one reviewers complaint, no you cannot play Blu-Ray on a conventional DVD player.  You are missing out.  Sorry.  Also, Amazon was quick with free shipping and they had best price I could find.
B003XKAZKO|5.0|With read reviews rating this release, I must agree with the other reviewer's views on their negative criticism however am fully drawn on the fact of the additional bonus tracks worth a release, finally. All the negative feedback from those reviews are not what I am interested in but the anticipation of a few bonus material tracks that finally see the light of day, and are worth the weight alone. I do have to say, what happened to Strip Tease With A Difference? At least this part was a complete disappointment for me. For this alone is the reason why I shy away from giving this remastered Bona Drag a 5 stars, and in only consideration of the release of the bonus material rather than all other facets considered by others.    1. Please Help the Cause Against Loneliness - an excellent Motown catchy guitar strung tune...  2. Lifeguard On Duty - a soft subtle tune with a nice chorus - very Smiths' like...  3. Happy Lovers At Last United - would have still been a great b-side to the same sessions of Everyday Is Like Sunday, even scored with strings.  4. Oh Phony - crisp, clear playing from co-writer Kevin Armstrong and a great tune entirely. Should have still been properly released as b-side, at least to Strip Tease With A Difference had it ever been considered as another single after prior to scratching the actual Bona Drag studio album. There is a better roaming internet copy of the song with complete drums and bass, and it too is of high quality sound...worth looking into as the official release copy on this cd seems incomplete, not intending to be an acoustic version of the song.  5. The Bed Took Fire - just prior to being remixed by Stephen Street and later being called At Amber for the Piccadilly Palare b-side however was recorded during the sessions and intended for the Interesting Drug single.  6. Let the Right One Slip In (long version) - makes no sense as to why this poor quality demo was even issued on this re-release of Bona Drag when it was not even recorded during this era but for the Your Arsenal era. This addition was completely unfounded...    With the flaws of the re-release, remastered Bona Drag, I am nonetheless truly excited to have most of these bonus songs in a official release. This should be reason alone if nothing else to consider purchasing it.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I only listened to this album in bits for the first few months so I was unable to truly appreciate it as one should.  Cosmic Love came on during a run last week and I was just amazed by the song and completely fell in love.  Now I can't stop listening to the whole album.  Her voice is so powerful and the music is just beautiful.  I love the use of different instruments in the album.  It's just exciting to finally find a whole album I truly love!  There may be one or two songs I am not crazy about but they're still great songs though.  Yay!
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Most of the 5 star reviews seem to be based on the premise \\"yes its awful, but look at the special effects\\". Well special effects can be good, bad or great, depending on how big a wall of money is thrown at them. In fact, if I were an atheist, I could find a convincing argument for the non existence of God in the fact that Emmerich manages to find the finance to hang his ridiculous films around such fantastic special effects. So lets look at this without the special effects and see whats left... Basically, plots and scripts so inane that they would probably have embarrassed the editors of the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon series.<br /><br />After discovering the impending disaster, the governments of the world needed to raise money from private individuals at 1bn Euros... yes Euros, per ticket to safety. The end of the world, even if its being kept a secret, rather begs the question of why the world economy would need to continue to function normally. Its not like storing up inflation in the system is going to be an issue. Meanwhile, out among the ordinary people, a loving divorced Dad rescues his cute kids and their Mom from the collapse of California into the sea with some nifty stunt driving, then manages to keep ahead of the pyroclastic flow from the exploding Yellowstone caldera with the same trick. I thought a pyroclastic flow moved at the speed of sound but I guess not. Mom's new boyfriend finally has the decency to get killed, thus avoiding any social awkwardness, (believe me, I'm not giving much away here) after flying the family to China. The family then re-unites, thus proving that there is no such thing as divorce... or something. Then we have the senior surviving member of the Whitehouse staff making dumb and inhumane decisions with no logical rationale other than to give the hero something to react against and prove his humanity with insufferable pomposity. In the background of one scene, Queen Elizabeth trots along to safety with her corgis, just to give the American contingent something to shake their heads over, without apparently giving any of them pause to wonder by what right they are on the liferaft. I'm middle of the road on the monarchy, but I do think its fair to say that, of any world leader, in the circumstances portrayed, she would be one of those most likely to stay with her people.<br /><br />The point is, this isnt in the tradition of dumb but fun big budget sci-fi, like 'When Worlds Collide' or even, 'The Core'. This wears a big suit of lights saying, 'look at my compassion and humanity' and like most who do, it is devoid of either humanity, compassion, humour or soul.just to give the American contingent something to shake their heads over, without apparently giving any of them pause to wonder by what right they are on the liferaft.

B003WTE886|4.0|What makes a good album?    This is a question which a multitude of artists attempt to answer every year. For Taylor Swift, the answer to this question has proven simple -- poignant lyrics, memorable melodies, and universal themes of love and heartbreak have become her trademark style, and listeners across all genres have raced to embrace her vision of country music. After a groundbreaking year in which she won awards at a multitude of venues, anticipation for the the twenty-year-old's third studio album was so thick that it was almost tangible. With Speak Now, Taylor Swift has attempted to solidify her place as the biggest act in country music, but with such a roller coaster ride over the past two years, could she top her previous success? Answering this question requires a detailed look at Swift's latest record.    The cornerstone of Swift's widespread appeal is undoubtedly her unique songwriting ability. As a lyricist, Swift manages to condense the emotions of her experiences into songs to which anyone can relate. Her wit and charm have earned her numerous supporters across the world, but some doubted that she could transition from songs about high school heartbreak and adolescent angst into a writer of mature songs about adult life. In Speak Now, Swift proves that her songwriting skills extend beyond the locker-lined hallways of high school into the realm of young-adult life. From capturing the uncertainty of balancing love with real life in \\"Mine\\", to giving a heartfelt apology (a first for Swift in an album) in \\"Back To December\\", to expressing the ambivalence teenagers feel towards the increased responsibility of age in \\"Never Grow Up\\", Swift lays a foundation for an emotional journey of unparalleled scope and clarity for someone her age. Once again, Swift manages to craft songs that can be understood by a younger audience who are living through similar experiences, while also appealing to any older listeners who can remember what it felt like to be her age.Though there are still some fairytale references in songs like \\"Enchanted\\", Swift has largely let the themes which ran through her sophomore album, Fearless, remain in the past. In doing so, Swift proves to the critics that she can mature as a songwriter and continue to produce tighter, deeper, and more satisfying lyrics.    Like most albums, Speak Now is constructed around a theme. Swift's theme for her third album is that of saying things she left unsaid -- each song is a confession to a specific person, telling each one what she failed to say in the heat of the moment. The result is a collection of songs with finely-honed lyrics, and each track sends a clear message. Unfortunately, a side effect of such specificity in her writing is that Swift may have constructed an album which reminds listeners more of her personal life than it does of their own. Those who have not closely followed Swift for the past two years may be more inclined to draw their own conclusions from the songs, while anyone who follows her activities may have a difficult time embracing some of the material. While this may be detrimental to the listening experience of some, it may not be entirely fair to blame Swift for the problem. If Speak Now is any indication, she has remained true to the same songwriting strategies that she established in her first two studio albums, and the only difference is that people now know the subjects of her songs before listening to the album for the first time.    A prime example of the nature of this controversy is \\"Mean\\", a song Swift reportedly wrote for music critic Bob Lefsetz. In it, she rebukes his commentary on her vocal ability and accuses him of cruel and unnecessary negativity in his evaluation of her talent. By tackling this topic head-on in an album, Swift has ostensibly risked additional rebuttals from other music pundits who may argue that she has proven an inability to handle criticism, but this is perhaps only a cursory understanding of the song. Few singers have managed to polarize listeners as strongly as Swift -- people either adore or despise her vocals, and perhaps the only people undecided about her voice are those who have never heard it. In Speak Now, Swift does little to change people's minds about her voice. Although the album features material that showcases both Swift's softer and louder singing abilities, her limited vocal range remains apparent throughout the listening experience. While it may be considered constructive criticism to point out her limited voice, many critiques of Swift's singing go far beyond what can be considered valid commentary. A host of online comments, ranging from degrading to hateful, seem to follow in the wake of everything Swift does, and it is difficult to believe that this has had no impact on the singer over the past two years. For someone whose trademark style is writing material about her own life, it seems not only understandable, but necessary, that Swift would address this topic in an album. While a professional critic like Lefsetz may make a convenient target for the song, it seems reasonable to interpret Swift's message in a broader sense that applies to everyone who propagates hateful speech.    Similar concern has been expressed over the impact of Swift's rise to stardom on a related attribute of her music: its universal appeal. Having built her career upon music that presents her as an average person who experiences the same things as her listeners, would leading the high-profile life of a celebrity cause her to lose perspective and create distanced music that no longer resonated with her core audience? The fact that most of the songs on Speak Now are directed at celebrities with whom Swift has been involved over the past two years might seem to speak to this point, but a more open-minded approach to the music is advisable. While \\"Mean\\" may be a personal rebuke directed at someone who has demeaned Swift in the past, does that prevent listeners from applying the scenario to their own lives? Surely Swift is it not the only person who has dealt with someone speaking cruelly about her. Similarly, Swift may apologize for her own relationship mistakes in \\"Back To December\\", but even though she has been involved with celebrities, Swift still keeps the song's message in simple, human terms -- someone loved her, and all she did was reject that affection. If Swift's latest batch of songs are any indication, she has been able to transition into the public eye without letting the attention derail her ability to reach out to regular people.    Of course, no album can rely on lyrics alone; a record depends on lyrics to send a message, but music is necessary to set the tone of that message. The music of Speak Now is perhaps the album's most intriguing quality. Swift's musical choices are nothing short of eclectic: from power ballads, to acoustic guitar renditions, to electric guitars combined with full orchestras, Speak Now covers a musical range that far eclipses her previous works. Swift's compositions have arguably advanced so far from the simple tunes of her first album, that having instrumental versions on the deluxe edition of Speak Now would have been a welcome surprise.    Despite this advancement in her musical repertoire, Swift's followers from the country scene may be disconcerted that the one musical style which is under-represented on the album is country. For someone who has cited country stars like Faith Hill as her inspiration for becoming a musician, it is somewhat perplexing that Swift would take her musical style in such a direction. On one hand, it is refreshing to see a musician who is unwilling to compromise her artistic vision to satisfy the expectations of specific genres, as some of the album's most impressive compositions would not exist on a traditional country album. On the other hand, the album's style may be a let down for those who hoped Swift would return to the country production of her eponymous debut album. The decision to stray further from a traditional country sound may cause some of her supporters to question whether Speak Now qualifies as a country album at all, and when compared to the few country acts who adhere to a more traditional sound, such questions may be valid.    It is, however, important to be objective when considering how an artist fits into the tapestry of a genre that has become as broad as country music. The days of country consisting almost exclusively of banjo, fiddle, and steel guitar have apparently passed (for better or for worse), and a great number of country artists have expanded their musical palette to include more popular sounds of electric guitar, increased percussion, and other elements previously underrepresented in the genre. When considering the entire gamut of songs on country radio, Swift's musical choices are perhaps not so out of place. In a climate where traditional country artists who sing about tractors like Jason Aldean can perform on the CMA Awards with mainstream artists like Kelly Clarkson, is it truly fair to label Swift's compositions as \\"not country enough\\"? While it would be refreshing to see Swift return to a more classic sound in a future album, it is important to acknowledge that her unique style of country has brought more listeners to the genre than that of any other artist in the last decade. Without Swift, many people would never have been exposed to the artists who have a more traditional sound, so even if her musical style strays from typical country fare, as long as she is able to enlarge the base of country music listeners, she deserves recognition alongside the genre's more traditional acts.    Even so, the fact that the music on Speak Now is more mainstream than either of her previous two records is perhaps the album's most prominent vice, even though the music also showcases the progression of Swift's capabilities as a composer. For someone who has defined a distinct lyrical style for herself, it is disappointing to see Swift emulate other mainstream musical styles instead of putting her immense talent towards defining a sound that she can call her own. This is not to say that the music of Speak Now is inherently deficient; indeed, the album contains many stellar compositions. It is rather to express a wistful desire to know how much more country the album could have been if Swift's skill at composition had been focused in that direction.    With these observations in mind, does Taylor Swift's latest offering have what it takes to be considered a great country album? Despite her deviations from the genre's traditional sound, Swift continues a proud country tradition of writing personal songs about real life, and by refining her craft for yet another album, she has proven that she has long-lasting promise as one of the genre's finest introspective lyricists. Swift has managed to expand the boundaries of her skill as a writer and composer once more, and only time will tell how her genre-defying musical choices settle with her core supporters in the country scene. While it remains uncertain whether Taylor Swift will return to a more traditional sound or continue to expand the boundaries of what is considered country music in the future, one thing is certain: Speak Now is a work of art.
0345349571|2.0|This book is a slog.  Tuchman is non-selective in her use of detail and unsparing in unnecessary description.  The result is that for long stretches the book has no focus or organizing principle.  The style tends to upstage the content.  This reader was caught in a blizzard of facts, names, and words.<br />Worse yet, the title is misleading if it seeks to promote an analogy between the Fourteenth and Twentieth Centuries.  No matter how similarly bloody the two periods, the Medieval and Modern world views and social structures are so disparate that motives for behavior cannot be compared.  Behavior may be similar on the surface -- owing to the constancy of human nature -- but it is manifest according to its environment, and these manifestations differ in fundamental ways between the two eras.<br />There are many better histories of the period written by better writers and analysts who have the ability to meld selected details into patterns.

B003ZK58WM|2.0|I have been a Ken Follett fan for years; the first book I read by Follett was the Eye of the Needle which I thoroughly.  His later tome's 'Pillars of the Earth' and 'World Without End', were my other favorites.  It is evident that I didn't really pay attention to the story line of Fall of Giants, and ordered it because I'm such a huge fan of Follett.  I am not really a war history buff, so I think my disappointment evovled because much of the story was a re-telling of WWI, and I was looking forward to a story featuring more of a historical romance story.  In this particular book, I came away with the sense that the romances which did take place were rather secondary than primary to the book.  I think that the reader who is interested in war history will find this a great read.  For those like myself who enjoy historical fiction/romance as the main themes will somewhat disappointed. To Follett's credit, his retelling of WWI was very insightful, and very well done.  I learned a great deal about the war and all of the major players (governments) involved; particularly regarding the Russian peasant revolution and the eventual overthrow of the Tszar's regime.

030745455X|4.0|I was unsure whether to continue this trilogy after reading \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".  While I thought that book was OK, its odd pacing and meandering focus was a little off-putting to me.  I never understood the reviews that described it as impossible to put down.  But, I am really glad I forged ahead.  \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" is so good, that I found that I even appreciated the first book more after reading this one.<br /><br />Largely, that is because while Lisbeth Salander is the title character in all these books (at least the English versions), and while she is by far the most interesting character, she really is not that central in the first volume.  But, now she moves center stage, and becomes an even more interesting character as we understand her better, as well as watch her evolve.<br /><br />But, besides this advantage, this installment in the trilogy does a better job of leading the reader through the mystery solving.  I felt that in \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" a lot of time was spent talking about how unsolveable the mystery was, and then rather quickly wrapping it up.  Here, you get to follow the investigators as they struggle to make sense of the various bits of information they come across, and can share their confusion when all the pieces don't fit as expected, until ultimately the whole picture becomes clear.<br /><br />And finally, while there was one horrendous villain in volume one (who seemed to just sort of pop out of nowhere), here there are a bevy of shady characters that we encounter through much of the book, with some interesting quirks themselves.<br /><br />There is one plot device toward the end that is just not believable, but that quibble does not spoil what is otherwise a great action/mystery story coupled with terrific development of one of the most interesting characters I have encountered.<br /><br />As to reconsidering my opinion of volume one, I see now that it actually did a pretty good job of setting the stage for what comes next.  So, while \\"Played With Fire\\" can stand alone, I think I enjoyed it more as a result of having read \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" first.<br /><br />I've seen some reviews that complain that \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" ends with too much of a cliffhanger, but I did not find that to be the case.  While there are obvious opportunities for a sequel, I thought the conclusion of this volume was quite satisfying.can stand alone, I think I enjoyed it more as a result of having read \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" first.

B002L5GQGY|3.0|Pairing two good drummers up together in a band should be off the hook, one drummer can play the rhythm while the other just tees off.  The drum duo on this DVD mostly attempt to play the same drum rolls in unison, the effect of which seems to be that they actually have to slow their playing down in order synchronize with each other.  Overall the band on this DVD is very tame, they sound like they could easily be backing a Broadway show. This is blues pasteurized and processed; Bonamassa is a great player, and his band are talented, but this DVD lacks fire and imagination.

Luckily, there is more gun play than other similar action-spy series but not overwhelmingly.  And I for one like the unpredictability of Maggie Q as a lethal agent (that would be the last thing I would expect with her dolled up).      So, not a bad show and worth the time to sit down and enjoy.  Hopefully, season two will have more sub-plot development and a few more added twists and turns.  So watch and enjoy, as I have.[[ASIN:B0042K4ZZK Pilot]]
B0040HJNKC|5.0|You wouldn't necessarily expect a lot from a blues guitarist in his seventies doing an album of all original material, but this cd is first rate.  The lyricist working with Buddy Guy has written interesting compelling lyrics about Buddy's life, and Guy's guitar playing is as strong as it has ever been.  Of all the stages of Buddy Guy's career (Poison Ivy, Junior Wells, and so on), his most recent albums have really been the best.  Purists may object a bit to his tendency to use a lot of distortion on his solos to create intensity (very different from either B.B. King or Stevie Ray Vaughan), but at least there is real intensity and well developed solos.  If you put this cd in with a mix of albums, it's these cuts that really make you listen.  If you listen straight through, it is rewarding, lively and varied.  Great blues!

In Capitalism, Michael reigns supreme and brings forward in his trademark style a remarkable description of the way forward for this country and the impact of Capitalism on America.<br /><br />Its stunning how accurate the film is despite being based on a vast topic, it is very well emphasized. I became a fan of Moore after Sicko which remains his best work.  I found the film to be utterly fascinating and compelling. The US Constitution doesn't guarantee happiness.

0307463745|5.0|I picked this book up in the airport bookstore while in Denver and started leafing though it. I put it down and decided not to buy it. From all the drawings and large print it just didn't look like there was going to be a lot of substance. However, the small portion of the book I was able to get through I just keep thinking about. I finally caved in and bought the book because I wanted to be able to come back to the parts I read in the store. Not only that if I was still thinking about what the authors had written a week after I casually looked through it I figured it deserved a second look.<br /><br />I was not disappointing, the book is fantastic and they even make a reference to why it is seemingly so short. In the chapter \\"Build half a product, not a half-assed product\\" they tell ow how they cut the book from 57,000 words to 27,000 words, to make it better.<br /><br />I agree this book is short, sweet, and to the point. Reading it will take about a day and you will greatly benefit. Photocopy some of the best chapters and paste them by your desk at work or hand them out in meetings, I know I will.

This way, you always have the two backup copies, and B-R is just wonderful on your big HDTV as a family movie night choice.

I love the first 2, but this one is so dark and I don't like most of the new characters.  I mistakenly did NOT watch it before viewing it with my 2 and 1 yr olds and I'm very sorry for that.  Thankfully I had not opened my copy before we watched it at my sister's so now I can return mine to Amazon and I have an excuse for my 2 yr old as to why she can't watch it again.  I liked the opening and the end (though the end made me cry) but the majority of the movie is very dark.  At one point they are in an incinerator waiting to be burned up!  I also don't like the premise that the characters are just trying to get back to Andy's attic so they can sit in a trash bag until... well they don't know.  Maybe I'll wait and let my kids watch it again when they are older.
B003YWUTKM|5.0|Gilmour (the only reason I got this album) has left me with mixed feelings in the past. I found his early work with Pink Floyd to be among his best. But when I heard the Division Bell and Momentary Lapse of Reason, I cried. How could Pink Floyd do this to me? Switching from the greatest psychadellic progressive rock band to a cheesy eighties band with millions of synthesizers and enough reverb to choke a horse. I bought On an Island by Gilmour in hopes of a better album, then found myself shedding more tears. But I decided to give Gilmour a last try, seeing as how he wrote Dogs and most of Echoes, also the fact that both songs are around twenty minutes long helped persuade me into purchasing it, and I was not dissapointed. Thank you Orb, for replenishing my faith in Gilmour. This album is relaxing, simple, and an overall good jam, you will not be dissapointed when you hear this album.
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|At first I didn't won't to see Miley Cyrus in some teenage romance story. But it happen to be good. And I enjoyed it. What is sad is she is going down Lindsay Lohan path which is very disturbing. But all in all the movie was really good and it was sad that her dad dies in the movie. Buy it or rent or check it out at your local library. I just hope she remember what it is like to be a good star and don't had down the path of corruption.(that's another story.) But a must see film.
B004132HZS|5.0|It's amazing how well Sherlock Holmes translates into the 21st Century.  I credit this to outstanding stories, and a stunning cast.  The world's best known detective is brilliant in any era it seems.<br /><br />The fact that they've adapted this to the tech era is bold and fresh.  I wasn't sure how well this could be pulled off, but I don't think it could have been done any better.<br /><br />I find Sherlock to be riveting entertainment.  I can't wait for more, and wish for a very long run for this series.
0060833459|5.0|Peter Drucker's The Effective Executive is a timeless classic!  I have read and re-read portions of this book countless times yet I still think it does not lose its value.  This book really changed how I approached being an effective person.  This book is applicable in any area where you want to make a real impact!

B001U887MO|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE these! I was a bit worried because they ran small, but after a few times wearing them they seem to have stretched out. They keep my happy little feet toasty warm. I don't wear socks with them. And the furry part comes out so you can wash it. Will DEFINITELY be getting another pair!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD just came sent from above!!! I was just looking at Amazon to find a workout DVD and I found Jillian. I'm used to read reviews to see if something works or not, so when I read more than 20 reviews from 1500 satisfied customers, I didn't think it twice!<br /><br />The first day I just felt like fainting, it is really intense, but as Jillian says \\"abs don't come for free\\", so the workout will sure pay off! On my second day, even though my body is sore, I did it with lots of effort. I can tell you, your body will feel like never before, \\"no pain, no gain\\" as they say!<br /><br />If you are still thinking it, stop and just purchase it, you won't regret it. I've set some goals to myself. I need to loose about 45 pounds, so trying to be more realistic, I've set 4 months for that to happen... March is my deadline. I'm going to combine 30 Day Shred with my other Jillian's DVD, a set of 4 I bought from Amazon/Mediaplanet. I highly recommend that set!!!<br /><br />Can't wait to continue my routine and for sure I will be buying her latest DVD \\"6 week, six-pack\\" which will be out for sale on Nov. 30<br /><br />Hope this review was helpful and make you decide to try it now!!!<br />J

1400079144|2.0|2nd Dan Brown book - maybe it's because I already know his style, but I thought some variation from his formula would be warranted. I think the previous reviews have been pretty fair. The book just does the same format over and over again and goes into too many mini tirades that I just ended up skimming over in the end, because they didn't advance the story. It just wasn't fun to read in the end.
0060775858|5.0|We have many copies of this book around the house. Our son is 22 months and has loved this book since we started reading it to him. He loves finding the mouse that moves around the pages and pointing out the different items we say goodnight too.    Well worth it
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I was a little worried when I heard that Russell T. Davies was leaving, but I was hoping that the author of \\"Blink\\" will not let us down!<br />This is a NEW Doctor all right. If you believe me, it's the best! It's all nerdy and fast thinking and caring, but Matt Smith brings a new depth that David Tennant was trying to achieve in his last episodes. It's this mystery and darkness and profoundness that the Doctor should have, someone you love and admire but that you also fear a bit, someone that you can never grasp completely because he is so much more... A Time Lord! Chris Eccleston had that, just a look in his eyes that brought you galaxies and eons away...the Fire and the Storm  brewing. Tennant developed it slowly through the painful 2nd Season where the relationship with Rose was getting ridiculous! But he was also loud, flashy and a little hyper. Smith's Doctor seems a wiser, more mature incarnation by comparison!<br /><br />Speaking of Rose, Amy Pond is in a league of her own! Makes Rose really look like an airhead by comparison! She is quick, witty and picks things up on the way, this is by far the smartest companion, beats Martha Jones! This is Gwen Cooper without the drama and soapy tendencies!( if you haven't watch Torchwood yet, give it a try!)<br />Way to go Karen Gillan!<br /><br />If you expect the \\"thrills\\" and \\"fireworks\\" we got used to during Davies' era, this series is more somber, maybe the BBC budget cuts are being felt, there is less \\"flashiness\\". But what is lost in that is gained in the witty script,and exceptional acting of Smith and Gillan. And YES, it's still sexy!<br /><br />No words are too little to acknowledge Steven Moffat's achievement, to take command after Davies and to actually improve the series... That is some feat! The previews on the internet are deceiving, everything looks so much better on the DVD, the new logo, the style, I was skeptic but I had no problem switching. It is more reverend to the look of the old series but no worries, it's by no means \\"quaint\\"! It's cool retro!<br /><br />Did I say enough about Matt Smith? I can't praise him enough! This kid is phenomenal! He brings  so much depth to the character, I hope he stays put for a while, can't wait for his next season!t\\"! It's cool retro!    Did I say enough about Matt Smith?

B003UBTX72|5.0|The stories themselves are fascinating.    Richards is a LOT more literate than I ever gave him credit for. This book shows that.    The opening chapter is hilarious.    Along the way, I found something interesting start to develop. Keith goes into different aspects of various songs that he and Mick Jagger wrote together. If you take those descriptions and then listen to those songs, it will give you an extremely different view of the songs. For anyone who is into music, this is an insight that I've never seen before.
B00461BQC0|3.0|This is the newest album from Kings of Leon made up of the Followill brothers (and cousin) and it is their 5th overall.  It is a good release but quite different from their previous work in my opinion.  It is about as good as their previous release Only By the Night. A good combination of fairly upbeat songs mixed in with a few ballad-like sounding songs.  I am not a huge fan of how the album ends.  I think they could have done a better job mixing in a few more upbeat songs. The album seems to end on \\"Birthday with the rest being fillers. Overall good album though that you wont be upset you purchased.  Here is my quick take on each track--<br /><br />1. The End--(4.5/5):  A real nice opening track to the album.  Ironically a song saying \\"this could be the end\\" that is the first track on the album.  A bit repetitive but nice.<br /><br />2. Radioactive--(4.5/5):  Perhaps the most popular song on the album as it was the first single released.  A hint of U2 in it.  See if you can find it.<br /><br />3. Pyro--(3/5):  Really a much slower song than I expected for a song named Pyro. I expected something more upbeat and it was somewhere in the middle of slow and fast.  But nice.<br /><br />4. Mary--(3/5): Can't say I am a huge fan. It feels as if they are experimenting with a bit of 50s Doo-Wop melodies.  Didn't do it for me.<br /><br />5. The Face-(3.5/5):  A nice, slow song. Really a bit of a love song. The vocal don't come through as well as I would have thought on this one particularly as he is trying to get a particular message across from one person to the other about wanting to see their face.<br /><br />6. The Immortals--(3.5/5):  Pretty decent song.  It lulls a bit in the middle.  No real theme to it that I could find.  But it is pleasant to listen to.<br /><br />7. Back Down South--(4/5):  Very country-ish sounding. Underneath the stars, where we park the car.  Seems to be talking about their teenage youth growing up in Tennessee.  Nice melody.<br /><br />8. Beach Side-(4/5):  A bit of R&B sound to it. Wondering as I listen to it why they are going there. Percussion is nice.  Rolls from R&B to fast country. It catches you and grows on you.<br /><br />9. No Money--(3/5):  The song does nothing for me.  It lost me right at the beginning. \\"I got no money...\\" is kind of how I felt after listening to this.<br /><br />10. Pony Up--(3/5):  Seems like there is a lot of drumming on alternative instruments going on.  Almost as if they brought in a guest ensemble to play with them.<br /><br />11. Birthday--(4/5): So on someone's birthday they are supposed to be upbeat.  The song starts slow but then they really rock out as it goes on and you remember that they are quite good musicians.  Kudos on this one.<br /><br />12. Mi Amigo--(3/5):  You think this should be a ballad but it seems to move slightly too fast for that. The melody is nice but somewhat average particularly after a strong song like Birthday.<br /><br />13. Pickup Truck--(3/5):  Ballad all the way. \\"You won't forget....\\"and then you kind of forget because it takes them a while to get back to the point.<br /><br />14. Celebration:  (3/5):  You want the album to end strong.  You really want it to. Very Midnight Oil sounding song but it never breaks into the fast, upbeat tune that you expect to come.sten to it why they are going there. Percussion is nice.  Rolls from R&B to fast country.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Stieg Larsson certainly knew how to tell a story.  I was late in starting \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo\\", so when I was hooked on it, a friend gave me her copy of \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\", halfway through that my Kindle arrived, and as I finished book #2 on a sunday evening, I went to my Kindle and dowloaded \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\" and two minutes later I had started it. WOW, the only problem I have now is, how do I follow up these fantastic thrillers?
0446679089|4.0|Title tells the story. Really enjoyed the author and want to see more of him. The condition of the book was disappointing. Looked like it had been lightly read - by half the frat house.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|Anybody that's curious about what's out there in music, let me educate you. Paramore is absolutly the coolest band to hit the airwaves. The album called, \\"Riot\\" is possibly their best album. Hayley Williams is the lead singer and I have a crush on her. I think any hot blooded male in the country would have to agree that she is very hot. Josh Taylor Zac and Jeremy are the other members. This band is awesome. Go ahead and buy this album, you won't be dissappointed.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Love this DVD. The solos, the group numbers, and the story lines, all made this a very fun DVD to watch.
B000002JS6|5.0|This album expresses all of the anxt of it's time. It's possibly the greatest rock album besides the Beatles White Album. It's the top second best selling album of all time. Michael Jackson's Thriller is at the top.

0060899220|4.0|Some Conversations    Reading a book is fun. If not, why would so many people do it? Am I right? In all seriousness, reading provides people with simple and complex pleasures. One person might become enamored with an illustrative setting; another may empathize with the struggles of a protagonist. In non-fiction literature, a certain power exists in the interaction between writer and reader. In other words, it is as if reading a book transforms the countless pages of text into a lively conversation. Kitchen Confidential exudes a conversational sense that I am in fact sitting down in a greasy spoon with Anthony Bourdain, discussing his life in the culinary business.    And what a life it is. If you believe that the restaurant kitchen is a simple and clean paradise, I cannot stress enough that you ought to avoid this book. Bourdain is loud, rude, and honest about his experiences in his industry.  The hands preparing your food have a story and your probably do not want to know it.    Hell's Kitchen    Bourdain's straight-forward storytelling displays his magnetic personality. His stories simultaneously exalt and demonize the kitchen as if it was ethereal and evil. Bourdain convinces me that my restaurant visits should never conclude in the ordering chicken or fish on a Monday; he reveals that my carefully cooked dish passed through the hands of undocumented immigrants; he also divulges the dark secret about my perfectly cooked sourdough bread: it was crafted by the hands of a drug addict. \\"Never fear,\\" he hypothetically declares! Your meal tastes great! Plus, Bourdain controls his kitchen like a demanding demigod - although nowhere near as perfect.    Concerning his operation, Bourdain proudly proclaims,        \\"But God protects fools and drunks, and we were certainly both foolish and drunk much of the time\\" (51).       Revisionist History or You Didn't Think I'd Try Another Pun Did You?    Despite his raw and gritty style, Bourdain's tome is inconsistent. The book feels like an autobiography as it flows in chronological order, but the writing lacks description when it moves from era to era. I found myself at times imagining Bourdain in a specific era and suddenly he mentions using a cell phone or laptop.  The images created in my head around his story begin to feel false as I edit them into the correct era.    However, Kitchen Confidential provides an informative view into an industry typically concealed behind the walls of customer service.  If you wish to maintain the illusory perception that the chef stands behind the curtains focusing on the finishing touches of your blandly ordered meal, I guarantee this book is not for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy No Reservations , wish to sit down with Bourdain at a greasy spoon, and are prepared for his verbal onslaught, I recommend this book.

B000F9RB9Y|5.0|The movie is classic, not the best movie of all time but well worth watching,    while the Bluray is not the best looking of all time either, but considering how old the movie is I think it looks great. I now have the entire Terminator collection on BD and they look WAY better than the ole DVD's.
0446195529|1.0|Lots of reviews here on the book's high price for the Kindle version. While Baldacci is one of my favorite authors, I'm voting against the high price by not buying the ebook. The publisher will charge what the market will bear, so our way to lower the price is to vote with our wallets by not paying it. If enough of us do, the price will eventually reflect it.

0393072231|4.0|This is a well written review of the collapse of the real estate market.  It deftly describes financial instruments of destruction, but even with the author's best efforts, their complexities may be beyond some readers.  I made a career out of finance and investing, and found parts of this book challenging.  One thing readers should take from the book is a committment to an investing idea if they know it makes sense.  The market may be saying something else, but if the reader knows he/she is right, then stay the course.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|All I have to say is buy the individual seasons.  I thought this was going to be a great buy... great price and compact!  However, I have not played one disk yet that has not skipped, stopped playing, or returned to the menu in the middle of an episode.  I have tried this on multiple DVD players and it does the same thing on every player.  I am extremely disappointed with this box set and wish I would have bought the individual seasons.  Save your $150 or whatever you are going to pay and put it to better use!
0307408833|5.0|I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this and a few other books in the mail.  Once I recieved them I started reading and creating a shopping list of needed supplies from the lists given at the beginning of the book.  I was looking forward to getting recipes using healthy sugar alternatives and gluten free flours.  Myself and a couple of my children (I have four) are on gluten free and reduced sugar diets. My other children also have multiple food allergies. So needless to say we have strict diet guidelines.  I also try to feed my family organic natural foods and keep the sugars in our diet to maple syrup, agave nectar, stevia, etc.  This book seemed like the perfect addition to my growing food reference library.      So after acquiring the necessary supplies I began to search out the first recipe I would make.  I love scones in the morning with tea, so I began to look through chapter 2 titled, Biscuits and scones....mmmmm....my mouth was watering.  To my surprise and disappointment EVERY recipe in chapter 2 uses Spelt flour, which I am unable to use on a gluten free diet.  So I couldn't use any of the recipes from this section of the book. (glad I also purchased Flying Aprons gluten free cookbook which has a section of scones/tea cakes that I not only can eat but also love!)     Now all was not lost since as I continued to look through other recipes in this book many fit my gluten free requirements.  So next I found Apple-cinnamon toasties....mmmmmmmm.... This is a labor intensive recipe as you are required to make roasted apples (the book gives you the recipe for these) as well as homemade apple sauce (again you are given the recipe as well as the option to use store bought unsweetened apple sauce).  But I love to bake so this was not a problem for me. And I can my own apple sauce every fall.  I was drooling while preparing the ingredients for this recipe.  I wished however that the 1 1/4 cups of evaporated cane syrup was agave nectar or maple syrup for a more healthful recipe.  I decided to make the recipe despite the large amount of unhealthy sugar used... ( I do have organic cane sugar on hand....did I mention I have 4 kids)  It uses a ton of cinnamon...2 Tbsp for one loaf of this recipe.  So you had better like cinnamon if you are making this.  It smelled wonderful as it was baking! It took much longer than the stated time on the recipe....and was very moist while warm.  Once it sat for about an hour and cooled the texture was much more firm.  It was love at first bite.... this is a wonderful recipe....and the texture is like that of all purpose wheat flour.  I could feed this to anyone and they wouldn't ever know that it was gluten free....dairy free....egg free...etc.  I was happy with this overall recipe.    I then went on to make some of the other recipes as well and all have turned out very good.  This book is a wonderful addition to my growing gluten/dairy/corn/egg/etc. free cooking library.  The only complaint I have is that I wish more of the recipes were without spelt and that either she gave substitutions for the cane sugar or that the recipes just didn't use cane sugar all together.      It is worth buying, even if you cant use all of the recipes in the book...
B0044XV3QY|1.0|When I saw this movie in the theater, I was blown away by the 3D visual effects. When I bought the DVD I was actually able to pay attention to the sub-par acting perpetuated by some of the most banal dialogue ever written for the screen. I'm sure by now you've all seen the \\"Pocahontas\\"/\\"Avatar\\" synopsis rip-off (a classic). So adding 16 more minutes is NOT going to entice me to rush into this version. Maybe Cameron should take a lesson from the Coen brothers when the re-released \\"Blood Simple\\" and actually make a shorter version?
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Gosh!<br /><br />Accept is back and this \\"Blood Of Nations\\" ia blow to the senses!<br /><br />The album is fantastic, in no small part thanks to the usual top-notch job production by British producer Andy Sneap.<br /><br />The new singer is amazing. Also, the music itself is fresh, vibrant, aggressive, melodic, heavy, well, everything at once! The album is much better than the last Accept albums (\\"Predator\\", etc). I will not compare it with the highlights of the band (the era englobing \\"Breaker\\", \\"Restless and Wild\\", \\"Balls To The Wall\\" and \\"Metal Heart\\"), because these are timeless classics that, at the time, did not benefit from the huge advance in recording technology.<br /><br />If you like Accept, there no chance at all that you will not like this one.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Different people have different favorite Beatle 'periods'. Many early Beatlemaniacs in the U.S. (Feb 9, 1964+) fell out when the band went Rubber Soul/Revolver. Too weird for them. That was probably true in other parts of the world as well. Some couldn't take \\"I am the Walrus\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields\\". Some didn't (re)discover The Beatles until Sgt Pepper. Others didn't accept them as rockers til the White album. So many mourned and cursed their demise as a band in 1970. Many fans weren't born until after they broke up. Many fans are yet to be born. A whole country (England) and many parts of Europe made them superstars before North America had any inkling they even existed. A relative handful (Liverpool) raved on them before all the hoopla started anywhere else. Other early, pre-fame fans (Hamburg, Germany) banged on the stage in appreciation when The Beatles were leather-clad hard rockers, pounding out 50's rock n' roll, high on beer and speed. Later, many innocents who had known them as cute pop-stars were shocked to discover The Beatles had this 'rough and rude' history. Some people never realized (or will realize) how profoundly The Beatles and their studio hands changed the record and recording industries, in so many different ways. They were the ultimate music industry revolutionaries, playing a large role also in changing the culture of large parts of the planet, their impact still reverberating to this day.<br /><br />This DVD covers all that and more, in very much detail. And for that reason it serves well as a true historical document (albeit filtered somewhat through the Beatles self-serving filters). John was oftentimes cruel and would rag on Beatles manager Brian Epstein, but as quickly turn around and write him...\\"you know I love you\\". Paul was very ambitious and could be pushy and smarmy, but he was the best musician and most creative Beatle. George was sarcastic, paranoid and preachy, but introduced the band, and the West to Indian music and culture. Ringo did not like to be challenged as a drummer, but was the glue that held the band together. Together, their efforts threw hot sparks of powerful, creative energy into the minds of countless people of varied backgrounds all over the world.<br /><br />In Anthology you don't get the entire '64 Washinton DC, or '65 Shea, or '66 Budokan concerts, or all of all the other shows, or every last unseen video, but you get well more than enough to satisfy: many, many excellent quality films/videos, and you see much, much newsreel footage, some of it rare, all in one place. Heck, I even noticed a couple scenes of their '66 visit to my hometown stadium.  And of course you get the band members themselves in interviews from past and current times(minus John, of course for the current interviews).<br /><br />If you're looking for 'just the tunes' look elsewhere. But if you want the tunes and the story behind the phenomenon of the Beatles, from the Beatles themselves, this is it.<br /><br />Unless you have read some of the better, noteworthy Beatles biographies, these DVDs will fill you in on the Beatles' story. Especially noteworthy, to me anyway, are the scenes in 94/95 when \\"The Threetles\\" hang out and we see how they personally relate to each other. It seems possible towards the end that George may be experiencing health issues and there is genuine emotion glimpsed. And Ringo opens his heart before the cameras and Paul and George and just plain states that he loves them and loves being with them. (He gets a little noogie and inside-joke from Paul). The recording of \\"Free As a Bird\\" is in so many ways sad, in tone, in execution and simply because John is not really there. Maybe in spirit he is. His loss is reflected in the ghostly quality of the recording and just leaves you to wonder...what if?id not like to be challenged as a drummer, but was the glue that held the band together.

B002QGUFWE|4.0|I'm a big Lady Gaga fan, and this album is fantastic. Most of the songs are quite upbeat and dance ready.  I put the album on my ipod and doing the elliptical at the gym has never been easier.  Those 45 minutes fly by!      I took off a star because I think The Fame is a better, more cohesive album.  This one is great, but not quite 5 stars.
0771035780|4.0|Despite its rather broad-sounding title, the \\"bad science\\" is really science associated with the health, nutrition and medical fields. The author, a physician and strong advocate of evidence-based medicine, guides the reader through what constitutes careful research and diligent analysis and interpretation of results. He points out the many pitfalls that even the most conscientious researchers can unwittingly fall into. But mainly he also discusses various tricks that less than honest researchers - those usually with a vested interest in some specific outcome of the experiments/research (e.g., some alternative medicine practitioners, some pharmaceutical companies, some nutritionists, even some physicians, etc.) - will use to promote their ideologies, products, etc., even when these have been proven worthless by honest, careful researchers. Carl Sagan's view that \\"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\\" features prominently throughout this book.<br /><br />This author is not afraid to express his views - especially when sloppy research and/or dishonesty is involved. His prose, although occasionally cumbersome, is quite lively, authoritative, friendly, often witty and fast-paced. Anyone interested in the use and abuse of science should thoroughly enjoy this book.
0525951652|2.0|I confess to being a bit disappointed in  this story. The constant switching of location and viewpoint was less than fascinating, though it works in other books. Telling a war story from the view of people on different sides is not exactly new. A highborn and a couple of lowborn English characters is good, as are the lowborn Russian brothers. The American character seemed to be simply added for American readers, and not to play a vital part (he could have been omitted without essentially affecting the story line). It might have been good to have a lowborn German or Austrian to balance the one highborn German: maybe a neer-do-well painter named Schicklegruber.  One gross factual error (page 684) made me wonder about the truth of other historical matters: Lenin's party boarding a train in Stockholm for Finland. Even I know there's a couple of hundred miles of Barents Sea to cross between them. Follett should stick a ferry in there in any future printings.
0385342020|5.0|This book was selected for my book club.  As I read it I liked it more and more.  I have always had an innate love for the elderly so this book was perfect.  Sadie teaches us so much in a very fun way.  It was interesting how she showed Laura that the man she thought was right for her was all wrong & truly not into her.  Sadie pointed Laura in the right direction to find herself and to be really happy in her career and love life. Laura helped Sadie to see that she was valued, admired, & loved. This book has a few meaningful messages that will make you think well after you are finished reading it.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This movie is spectacular. I saw it twice in the theatres in 3D and it was a great experience. The world Cameron created was amazing. There are a lot of nitpickers out there and ususally their complaints are weak. As far as the story, yeah it's not a new one, but it's still a good one. It works and it played out well. As far as Cameron, don't hate the movie just because it's from him which some people seem to do. As far as the multiple releases.....well:    Do your research before complaining about this movie being released on video multiple times. It was well-known back in April when it first came out on DVD\Blu-Ray that is was a bare-bones release and that there would be a \\"deluxe\\" version later in the year. Even if they didn't announce this new version at the time, you had to know that one with all the features would be coming. No one forced you to buy the bare-bones release and anyone would know a newer version would be coming. So don't complain about having to buy it again. No one was duped.    This current version has some amazing special features. If you loved the movie, you have to have this. If you already bought the bare-bones version, then it's up to you to buy it again. Either way, it's not a reason to give it 1 star. This is a fabulous cinematic experience. Not perfect, but different from pretty much anything else.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I really don't understand why there so much backlash regarding this new version. The various versions that would be available in the future was never a secret and if you preferred to purchase the movie before all the special features were completed how is the anyone's fault but your own? All the studio did was to make a plain Jane version available for those who did not want to wait. I will say I am a little surprised that the 3D version was not released along with this version, but maybe there's more work to do on the 3D version, such as 2D to 3D conversion of extra material (the making of type stuff). Anyway, most people (myself included) do not have 3D TVs yet, so for us it's a moot point. If the various versions that would be available were kept a secret then people would have justification in being annoyed, but this was not the case.

I LOVED it!
0688101364|5.0|I am in the process of ordering my second copy, the first being too splattered and in too many pieces to use, after 12 years of hard work in my kitchen.  I have tried other cookie books--I like Martha Stewart's book although the way it is organized drives me nuts (it's by texture, so when I want to pick out which chocolate cookie to make I have to flip to every section)--but this is my favorite.     The recipes aren't simple--none of that \\"make 7 cookies out of one dough\\" like they put in the magazines at this time of year--but they taste astonishing, and since even the magazine kind represents a serious time commitment, I'd rather do the little bit extra and get Birnbaum's spectacular results.   I haven't made the cathedral, admittedly, but the tried-and-true simpler ones, like pfeffernusse, black and white meringues, lemon-poppyseeds the little powdered sugar and cinammon sugar crescents,and the rugelach have become family favorites.  I don't get thorugh the holiday season without making the minicheesecakes, either (leftover hommade chunky cranberry sauce makes a good topping).  So it's time for a new copy, and this time I'll try to remember to put plastic wrap over the pages while I'm baking!

B003A9WLCS|5.0|I'll admit I was one of the people who would have rated this 2 or 3 stars, I'd even go so far as to say I felt bad about paying a little more to have pre-ordered the CD.  Thankfully, I withheld from posting a review until I listened a little more.  Many people will say the songs on this album are far off from songs which have been listed as Sade's \\"Greatest Hits,\\" but after repetitive listening, you'll find the music truly fits with the lyrics for the songs.  What might put you off the first time (or few times) you listen to it, is that the music itself - the chords, the sound, the rhythm - is NOT what you would typically consider a Sade hit from the first go-around.  I think we're so accustomed to hearing her band's music in one certain fashion - more uplifting and upbeat - it makes this an album that will throw you off, maybe even as some say \\"disappoint\\" you.  If you were never a Sade fan, chances are this will not make you enjoy her any more than you did the day before.  Sade fans: Take into consideration that she has not recorded anything for quite some time (ten years), and she writes about things that she experienced or feels... This is not an album to give a once over.  I can't say that enough.  But if you take some time out of your busy life schedule and spend some alone time to not just listen, but hear and feel Sade's lyrics - this album is just as good as the others, if you can accept that just as time changes, people do too (and so do music styles).  Sade is still as sexy, sensual and deep as she's always been, and her incredible voice is proof that some things will always be the same.
0393327345|4.0|I'm not going to go all out on here but the ending is what really is unsettling because there is none. It's different from the movie and it's a puzzle. Read it, it's fast and glorious in all it piousness of demonic rage. But it's a great book, don't get me wrong.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This is one of those rare instances where a star actually was born, Audrey Hepburn's Hollywood debut in 1953 as Princess Anne in \\"Roman Holiday\\" makes you catch your breath in wonder.   All these many years later, it's still readily apparent just how extraordinary she was, especially compared to the Hollywood female stars that were popular in the early 1950's, or for that matter the ones popular right now.  One can well understand as to why she caused such a sensation.  For me, I feel the moment she became a star is the first time she truly smiled on the screen, early in the movie when she is escaping her palace by stowing away in the back of a catering truck.   As she looks out into the Roman street traffic she spies a young couple behind her riding on a motor scooter, she smiles, really smiles radiantly for the first time, her whole face lights up as she waves to the couple, and I was a goner for her, hook, line and sinker!      \\"Roman Holiday\\" is a modern day fairy tale; Princess Anne (Hepburn) heir to the throne of a small-undisclosed European monarchy does a good will tour of Europe.   Every stop is rigidly scheduled, official functions, presentations, balls etc., Anne's speeches are written for her, her clothes are chosen, and she is very strictly chaperoned.    Even though she is a very young woman, probably twenty- one at most, her royal retinue is all middle-aged to old, very staid and proper.    She has no opportunity to be spontaneous, to be around people her own age, to sample any of life's simple pleasures, to laugh.    Inevitably, her stifling constraints cause a meltdown one evening in Rome as Anne prepares for bed.   She is given a sedative to soothe her and make her sleep, but once alone she escapes into the night.   As the drug begins to take effect, she dozes on a low wall where American reporter Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) discovers her.   Mistaking her grogginess for tipsiness and feeling sorry for her he brings her back to his apartment to sleepit off.   The next morning he recognizes her as the missing princess, and realizes he's sitting on the story of his career.   He doesn't tip Anne off that he knows her true identity, and she in turn introduces herself as \\"Anya Smith\\".   Joe persuades the willing Anne to play hooky for the day with him doing whatever she likes and arranges for a photographer friend of his Irving Ratovitch (Eddie Albert) to accompany them to sneak some photos to use in the scoop he plans to write on the runaway princess.    The trio enjoys a carefree, joyous day together and the princess and the reporter begin to fall in love.       All of the elements blend together beautifully to create a cinema classic.   One of Hollywood's finest directors William Wyler was at the helm working with a beguiling story and script by the unjustly blacklisted Dalton Trumbo, (Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him) and John Dighton, glorious location filming in the Eternal City and finally an exceptional cast both Gregory Peck and Eddie Albert seasoned film veterans helping showcase the neophyte Audrey Hepburn.   I've only seen Gregory Peck in two film comedies, \\"Designing Woman\\" and this, while he doesn't have the comedic skill of a Cary Grant or a Jack Lemmon, he acquits himself well in both.  Here's he's the knight errant who comes to rescue the sleeping princess from the prison of her routine which he does with an easy charm and panache that first is a trifle slick and self serving, but which soon melts into a truly protective tenderness and love for Anne.  As Joe's sidekick Irving, Eddie Albert changed his whole persona growing out his trademark crew cut and sporting a full luxuriant beard.  He's an endearing rascal who develops a conscience near the film's end, Albert is naturally funny as well, particularly in his pratfalls and was nominated deservedly for Best Supporting Actor, but unfortunately didn't win.     Despite all the above fine work, \\"Roman Holiday\\" will be ultimately remembered as the American debut of Audrey Hepburn, and it should be that way.   Words seem inadequate to try to capture the dazzlingly incandescent star quality that made Audrey Hepburn so unique and irreplaceable; sufficient to say she had it, and we moviegoers were the lucky beneficiaries.   What impresses me besides this, her exquisite looks, innate intelligence, natural grace and the enchanting cadences of her voice (yes, I gush about Audrey Hepburn) is what an accomplished actress she was at such a young age, being not quite 24 when \\"Roman Holiday was filmed.\\"   Her portrayal is fully realized, she transitions seamlessly between the comic and dramatic scenes, suggesting a wealth of emotion in her expressive countenance, and she is able to make you bubble with laughter or bring a swift rush of tears to your eyes.   Ms. Hepburn deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar, her first New York Film Critics Award and the Picturegoer Gold Medal for her Princess Anne.      \\"Remembering Roman Holiday\\" a short subject is the best of the DVD extras.   Interviews are presented with Gregory Peck, Eddie Albert, Catherine Wyler, daughter of the director, and film critic Molly Haskell among others.   A real treat is the opportunity to witness some of Audrey Hepburn's screen test, where she doesn't know the camera is still filming and her powerful charm comes through, and you can see just why she got the role.  There is a short on the restoration of the film that is moderately interesting from a technical standpoint, also yet another on costume designer Edith Head who designed the costumes for the film.   Finally there are the trailers and photo galleries, all good additions.  The print looks pristine; the sound is superior both thanks to the excellent restoration.      If you haven't seen this film yet, what are you waiting for?
B002C6A6N6|1.0|Dreadful.  Soundtrack in too many segments is not synchronized with picture. Too distracting to watch at those times. The person who edited the series to this should be fired.  The person whose lips are moving should match the soundtrack.  If there was a selection of less than 1 star that is how I would rate it.

0517548232|5.0|I wish I had read this book in school among all the others I am now reading!  It helps to answer the many questions I had as a child and as I got older. Questions were about why the govt did this or that, and according to my opinion, I thought that what the govt did was stupid and wasteful and thought maybe they knew something I didn't know, after all, they had experts for advisors. Now by reading this book, and others including [[ASIN:B001SES266 Meltdown: A Free-Market Look at Why the Stock Market Collapsed, the Economy Tanked, and Government Bailouts Will Make Things Worse]] (the books listed by Ron Paul should also be read), I now understand clearly why the govt did what it did, why it was stupid, and why the govt and the advisors think the wrong way that they do. These books also explain why the things that we thought were good ideas because they seem to make sense and we were thinking with our hearts, many times are really bad ideas and make things worse. They are the ah-ha and \\"I never thought about it that way\\" moments, and then you know why so many people were against these \\"good ideas\\", and you knew that so many of those against it were everyday regular people and weren't all \\"greedy\\", \\"selfish\\", etc., most cared just like you did.  (Ignore grammar, spelling, etc. errors) (Most of all ignore the moron losers who give this book one star)
B00005K3NY|3.0|I do like a drop of Cronenburg, even when it's a little flat. This fairly early work is pretty rough at the edges, includes some outrageous gurning, some somewhat schlocky acting, and some unintentional laughs. Despite this, however, SCANNERS is a powerful little movie. Cronenberg's fascination with the visceral is present here, along with his interest in how the human mind and body might be transformed. These themes will be developed further, and to greater effect, in later films, but here they fail to sufficiently invigorate an otherwise lacklustre piece. Interesting for Cronenberg fans but something of a nadir when compared to later work.

B0012CH350|2.0|I read the product description and it specified that it covers the grill all the way to the bottom -however, it's so small that it's hard to fit the grill on it. in addition to this, it does not cover the wheels. as the picture shows but the description does not clarify it so I was misled. In terms of the product quality is very sturdy so it does protect the grill well. but if I realized that the size was so tight/smaller I would have bought the bigger one.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|The good thing about fringe is.... it's not Lost, it does not lead you somewhere and then let you down... they talk about the other side, and then go there, they show both sides of things as \\"real people\\" although I would like personally the over there to be a bit more villainous, they do take their time on reveals like is Peter from over there.. yes it took them awhile after the viewers knew it to reveal it to the characters. Same with Alt-Olivia we know she is from over there but it takes awhile to show that to the people that count. The show had lost it's momentum in the second season with the creature episodes but found a home with mythology heavy shows and has kept it up... Good job Adams for not killing fringe like Lost.
B000GPI2EK|3.0|Am I the only one who thinks that this album is a little boring, a bit tedious, not to mention self-indulgent?     There are way too many cord changes and the band often veer off into the distance, not really grabbing you by the scruff of the neck as they had done with \\"Leviathan\\". I see a lot of positive reviews up here, so maybe it's just me. Great band, though.
0060574216|5.0|My mom has had this book on her bookcase for at least 15 years, if not more, and I had heard references to it before, but I wasn't ever really interested. Mainly because I thought it seemed like a self help book for 40 year old cat ladies (no offense to the 40 year old cat lady readers) and that I didn't really need much advice seeing as I was in my late teens. But I was very wrong.       Recently I had been having problems with my ex-boyfriend. We were trying to work on our relationship to see if we could make things work and it was proving very difficult. I hit a brick wall and I had no idea what I was doing wrong or if I was just crazy. But I realized that I knew he cared and loved me and I felt the same way, so why couldn't we communicate our needs? Why didn't he ever seem to understand what I was saying?       For some reason, my mom quoted the book when I discussed the problems I was having. She said, \\"It's like what Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus says, men are like rubberbands, they stretch far away, but they can only stretch so far before they come running back.\\"        So from there, I decided I might as well try this book. When I picked it up, I was very impressed. It discribed men and women so well and discribed so many situations that I have been in, it was uncanny. I was very wary in trying the suggestions because I didn't know if it would change anything, especially because we weren't even dating at the time, but I didn't have any choice, so I proceeded. It seemed to me that my ex was in his \\"cave\\" and that is why he had been pulling away. So I set my boundaries by telling myself I was not going to put more effort in this relationship than he was putting in. I did not chase after him; I did not call or text him unless it was necessary (normally I would have found ANY excuse to call or text). I tried my best to not offer unsolicited advice and I acted like nothing was wrong so he would know that I still loved him. In the beginning it wasVERY hard, I thought maybe he would think that I didn't love him anymore, but then I relized that men don't think the same as women. Knowing that the pulling away was not personal really helped me take the first step.        After a few days, yes, just a few days, it was incredible how he responded to it. He was getting closer and closer. Calling me more and wanting to spend more time with me. Showng me more affection than before and only after about 4 days. I could not believe it was working so well! I felt like I was cheating the system, like I had found a loophole that no one else knew about, like I had a secret advantage. I still feel that way. I think everyone should be required to read this book before getting married. Heck, they should be teaching this in school. I am so thankful for this book. If you are having problems or are just curious, I guarantee it will open your eyes to something new and make every relationship better. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0307594777|3.0|So far, I have read only the first book of the trilogy.    It's a little slow for my taste, especially the first hundred and some pages. The author uses very detailed descriptions that only add to the length and not to the quality of the writing or the story. Also, the foreign names would have benefited from a refresher. It somewhat reminded me of why I don't like reading the Russian authors much.    I enjoyed the book, overall, but it is not going to make my list of \\"must be read every ten years\\". Don't write to me if you loved it and/or strongly want to defend the Russian classics.    UPDATE:  I just finished the #3 book of the trilogy. I must say that, overall, it was a rather painful experience, but I just \\"had\\" to know how this would all end up. I grew consistently annoyed with the insane amount of characters involved and their impossible names. Good luck keeping track of them all.    It's probably best to stick with the movies as they must abide with an abbreviated version.    I don't regret reading these books. I won't read them again, which is unusual for me. If I had known the amount of frustration involved in the reading, I would NOT have started. gain, that said, I found it impossible not to keep going and I jsut had to find out what the twisted mind of the author had concocted.
B002ZG98FU|2.0|It isn't often you see a film in which every actor is painfully misdirected. Rachel McAdams performs most of \\"Morning Glory\\" as if she were a little girl on a bad sugar high, always with the anxious babbling and the perky expressions and the neurotic enthusiasm she brings to her situation, which is itself so horribly contrived that it doesn't belong in a movie so much as it does on a sitcom. Harrison Ford, an accomplished actor if ever there was one, delivers every line like a growling dog ready to attack an intruder, his voice low and gravelly and unendurably monotone. Diane Keaton, also quite accomplished, plays her character as a cliché - laughing on the outside but screaming on the inside, crunching on pills as if they were candy. And then there's Jeff Goldblum, although in his case, it doesn't have much to do with direction; he can't seem to be anyone other than himself, no matter what role he plays.    \\"Morning Glory\\" is an utterly ridiculous film. The plot is goofy and scatterbrained, relying almost entirely on throwaway gags and set-ups that wouldn't even pass muster in a romantic comedy. The performances are desperately broad and show not the slightest traces of truth. It was written by Aline Brosh McKenna, the same woman who brought the far funnier and far more intelligent \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" to the big screen. Having followed that with the awful \\"27 Dresses\\" and now this, I'd hate to think that her success with \\"Prada\\" was nothing more than a fluke.    The plot: McAdams plays Becky Fuller, a workaholic New Jersey TV news producer who dreams of landing a job over at \\"The Today Show.\\" After getting fired from a local news studio, she's immediately hired as the executive producer for a failing New York morning news show called \\"Daybreak.\\" The boss, Jerry Barnes (Goldblum), interviews her with the kind of depressing certainty that one must apply to choosing a casket. Everything behind the scenes is chaos, the studio populated by annoying, insufferable caricatures that sling all sorts of meaningless ideas at her. On air, the show is a dispensable mishmash of cooking segments, animal acts, and celebrity gossip. Oh, and the occasional weather report, provided Ernie Appleby (Matt Malloy), a silly man who thinks rooster-shaped weather vanes are fascinating for some reason. Becky's mission is to prevent the show from being cancelled.    The lead anchor, Colleen Peck (Keaton), seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown, a woman who has seen so many co-anchors and executive producers come and go, she has given up all hope. The latest co-anchor, a sleazy egomaniac with a foot fetish, is immediately fired; this leaves Becky able to pursue Mike Pomeroy (Ford), a man whose years of esteemed reporting is second only the dubious distinction of being the third worst person in the world. Indeed, he's a broken, spiteful, difficult, miserable soul - angry at what passes for news nowadays, frustrated that he's not wanted for in-depth investigative journalism but merely for morning banter. Unfortunately for him, he has time left on his contract. Becky not only knows this, but also uses it against him. And so, with extreme misgivings, he becomes the new co-anchor of \\"Daybreak.\\"    As Becky tries desperately to raise the show's ratings, she begins a relationship with a fellow producer named Adam (Patrick Wilson), who finds Becky interesting but struggles to tear her away from her ever-ringing Blackberry. He's the film's only tolerable character, probably because he's developed at a level beyond a series of bizarre quirks. Alas, it's precisely because of this that he disappears into the background; all the weird characters take center stage, and while that might sound like a lot of fun, here it's just plain exhausting. The relationship itself is nothing more or less than typical romcom material, something I can and do get my fill of year after year after year.    There was, in short, nothing much I liked about \\"Morning Glory.\\" Its biggest miscalculation is its cast - or, more accurately, how the cast is directed. Harrison Ford in particular is an embarrassingly odd fit, his voice rarely if ever rising above a grating one-note lull. When he finally is given the opportunity to show genuine emotion, it soon becomes clear that it's in service of a scene of amazingly clunky sentimentalism. Watching it, one wonders if McKenna forgot that the film was intended to be a comedy. I also found nothing appealing about Rachel McAdams' character, a young woman so peppy and bungling that it surpasses charmingly eccentric and becomes just plain annoying. If this movie were an actual morning news show, I'd recommend you either sleep through it or try another channel.
1427210497|1.0|the first mistake I made was deciding to read Freedom.  The second mistake was reading it via CD.

Really it makes me wonder if all the gushing reviewers actually READ the book!
B00499LTLM|5.0|I have always loved Sherlock Holmes. I grew up reading the stories and watching the innumerable movies and television series, trying to decide which actor played the most accurate portrayal.      As a result, I developed an unending admiration for this brilliant and charismatic character that has influenced so much of my life. He is why I learned to play the violin at age five and play still. Why I chose to pursue a career in which I break down the psychological profile of criminals. And there's a slight possibility it may explain my affinity towards men with a brilliant and analytical mind, a great wit, and British accent (just kidding... about the accent).     All joking aside, I suppose one could call me a bit of a fan; and that being said, it isn't difficult to imagine that when I heard of a new series placing Sherlock Holmes in modern times, I was both exicited and a little leery.     But that was all put to rest within the first ten minutes of the first episode. Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal is flawless. He embodies everything Sherlock Holmes should be; charming and brilliant,and occasionally impetulant; and as much can easily be said of Martin Freeman in his portrayal of  Dr. Watson. But it is really the pairing of the two that makes the show truly enjoyable; and never for a moment is it ever dull.     I can honestly say, as a long time fan, that this series brings to life Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories in an entirely new way. A way I would like to think even he would enjoy.

The \\"Go To\\" gives four options, Cover, Beginning, Location and Table of Contents but the Table of Contents field is not active. So, cannot access the Table of Contents which is really necessary for a big book like this.   Got a refund after talking to Amazon's call center in India.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I'm not sure what the complaint is from other reviewers about either the music this group sings or the language in which they sing.  I attend classical and pops symphony concerts in the city where I live.  I must, however, had my head \\"under a bucket\\" somewhere, because I have just been introduced to this performing group. To borrow a phrase from another admirer, \\"I wouldn't care if they were singing the phone book\\".  The voices are the glory.  I own cds \\"La Promesa\\" and \\"Siempre\\" and plan to buy all they release. I will be constantly watching for a concert in my area, Texas.
B000BT97AO|5.0|One of the best films ever. I found it at Safeway and it caught my eye just like that for some reason. I'm glad i bought it since it did not dissapoint me. I love Helena and all the cool creatures of the fantasy world she's in. Great story and CG animation. A must-see! I watched it 8 times already and i'm still having urges to watch it again!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is one of the best tv series i've seen in a long time. Castle and all the characters are funny and awesome!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Oliver Stone is back and this time he is actually working again for the U.S. government.  Oliver is requested by the President to come back into government work to help solve a problem.  Sure he is getting old but the problem is that the cold war with Russia is heating back up on a new front and the young CIA agents of today don't have the experience necessary to deal with the problem.<br /><br />So the President asks Oliver to come back to work.  Hard to believe but he agrees to take the task.  But as soon as he does the task spins out of control as a bomb goes off right across the street from the White House.<br /><br />In this novel we are going to be introduced to a whole new set of characters as Oliver tells the Camel Club to take a hike and instead he is tasked to work with agent Chapman, an MI6 British agent.  Their partnership is going to give us a great ride as they struggle to solve the bombing while being hampered by inter agency rivalries and very intentional mis direction from each of their handlers.<br /><br />The problem, both Stone and Chapman are so capable that they keep peeling back the layers of deception and discover that there has to be a mole working the inside of this case and staying one step ahead of them.  Every lead they get keeps ending up dead.<br /><br />Baldacci does a great job of keeping you interested in what's going on and develops the new characters so well that you feel as though they are old friends even though they have just arrived.<br /><br />Don't worry though, the Camel Club members won't be pushed to the side, they force their way back into Oliver's life and come along side to help with the case.  Oh an agent Chapman, a by the book agent, learns from Stone that sometimes you have to break the rules and trust your partner more than your superiors.<br /><br />I couldn't put the book done and know that if you are a Camel Club fan you are going to love this novel.  My only sadness is that I finished the book and the next installment is no where in sight.  David, please write faster and get us the next book :)<br /><br />Enjoy!rite faster and get us the next book :)    Enjoy!
159102594X|2.0|***WARNING - POTENTIAL SPOILERS***  I posted this review on the page for Volume Three of this trilogy: Last Argument of Kings, but then realized that it would perhaps be better posted here, as it will do little good to warn people about that novel after they have already read the first two installments.  This series made me angry.    You see, I really, really enjoyed the first two parts, including The Blade Itself.  They were well written.  They were gripping.  They had loads of interesting and unusual characters.  If I were rating The Blade Itself standing alone, without regard to what comes later, I might easily have given it 4-5 stars. I tore through it and the sequal and dived into the third installment eager to find out what happens next.  Now I wish I hadn't.  For little did I know that the author, Joe Abercrombie, has an...aversion...for happy endings.  Perhaps aversion is the wrong word.  Perhaps \\"disdain\\" would be more accurate.  I was floored by what I read (and not in a good way).  I am not a child, and I do not demand that all stories I read be wrapped up in neat and tidy \\"happily ever after\\" packages.  But I simply could not understand why someone would ever choose the path this author took to end a series.  Things, quite literally, end well for no one (except, perhaps, for those who least deserve it).    I was so confused I even went to the author's website, and read through his blog, in an effort to understand his motivations.  Apparently, the author is of the opinion that happy endings are for wimps and his stories are going to be \\"realistic.\\"  He appears to take a perverse joy in defying conventional expectations, and practically laughs at those who foolishly expected anything else.    If I were to try to summarize what I took away from this reading experience - the message that the author appeared to be trying to convey through his characters and their experiences - it would be this:  Don't bother trying to become a better person.    Amazingly, there appear to be plenty of readers (what do you call those who enjoy watching the suffering of others?  Sadists?) who also share the author's sentiments and who have heaped praise upon him for his unconventional approach.  So it's hard to fault the author from a marketing standpoint.    Therefore, I will simply close with this:  If you enjoy misery, if you get a kick out of seeing characters you have come to care about, and who have struggled to overcome adversity, lose everything. By all means, buy this series.    This is one \\"wimp,\\" however, who won't be subjecting himself to any more of Mr. Abercrombie's particular delights.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|An Excellent CD/DVD combo @ a great price. The Recording sounded fresh and full of energy. I listened to it on my 7.1 JBL Studio Surround system cranked up and it was very entertaining. A must buy for any classic rock fans in the Led Zep/Deep Purple Genre!! The accompanying DVD was a great Bonus with live concert footage and studio rehearsal as well as informative interviews with the band and producer!! The more I listen to it the better it sounds!Not a \\"Super Group\\", just a group of talented musicians with a passion for Rock!!I highly recommend it despite the other critical reviews. Heck, I didn't like \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" when I first heard it!!Get back to the Black Country and enjoy this one for years to come!!

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I just ordered this for my brother's birthday. I hope it's good! It's one of the most expensive gifts I've ever gotten him. I know he really wants it. He got Band of Brothers for his last birthday, and we watched it together.
0143117564|1.0|I am always determined to finish a book, no matter how awful it is. This book has stalled me out for 2 months. I literally dreaded picking it up to finish the last 30 pages. I have finished it now, and have no idea whatsoever what was going on. The first novel ever that has left me completely clueless. The characters are a wasted lot. This book makes the classic NAKED LUNCH by Burroughs completely coherent. Where is Kerouac when you need him? I love the beats. I love the sixties & all the psychedelia that went along, but this book just brings me down. I am in the process of writing my own novel and stuff like this that becomes best sellers really makes me question the sanity of this world we live in. The only redeeming thing in this whole mess is the mention of Jonathan Frid (Barnabas from Dark Shadows) doing some kind of nightclub act in Vegas (fictional). The dialog is pure torture. Enough said. Proceed at your own risk...hey it takes all kinds...
B0042AEOG0|5.0|A very lovely and warm Christmas Album from Mariah Carey.  I'm glad she didn't do the same line with the first one.  I also love her first Christmas album, but love this second one more!
B0000009SF|5.0|Zappa was a man who refused to be pigeonholed... just when you'd find him go in one direction, he'd go in a totally other, and most of his fans were more than willing to follow.<br /><br />Of Zappa's early/mid-70's Jazz/Rock experimentations this album is unique in that its not just the Mother's stretched out and playing Jazzy, but an actual arranged and scored big band - - a format that he'd return to on his last tour.  - - The band is brassy, at times even happy and bouncy - - and of course, includes some of the trademark Zappa'isms (the forays into sillyness and absurdity) that you'd expect...  and though the album doesn't have the upfront vocal satire present on APOSTROPHE and OVERNIGHT SENSATION, it is definitely a product of that era.<br /><br />Key things to listen for:  great solos from the entire band and a really tight rhythm section... when the band grooves, they really get down and funky... as you listen to the solos you can't help but get into it, even as the band goes in directions that only Zappa could go...  Fans of \\"Electric Miles\\" and Sun Ra might even appreciate it, though there's one catch  - -  typical to Zappa, no matter how complex his music became it was never pretentious or directionless... or in that case predictable.<br /><br />If you like this album and are new to Zappa, I assume you've already heard APOSTROPHE and OVERNIGHT...<br />WAKA JAWAKA might be next up (though I like this one better) - - after, HOT RATS and ROXY are probably the next stops to take... though you'll probably also enjoy the recordings from his latter BROADWAY THE HARD WAY TOUR including MAKE A JAZZ NOISE HERE.
B00019PDKC|3.0|This album is 3 stars because many of the songs are listenable. I rather enjoy listening to this album.<br />I just recommend this album. Addy.
0312600844|1.0|What a major time waster.... so disappointed because it started off well but then went unbelievable, and worse yet, boring. I lost interest in every single character. I even read the ending after awhile just to get out of this. I've donated my copy to Good Will. It was not a keeper.
0439023521|5.0|What else can I say? I lost sleep staying up to listen to this book on CD just to see what happened! Knowing that this is a trilogy I knew that Katniss would survive, but that didn't dilute the excitement one bit.    Some reviewers say this book is a direct rip-off of a Japanese book called Battle Royale. I am not familiar with it so I don't know. All I know that this book picked me up and kept me going, and won't put me down until I read the second and third books.    People have compared this book (kids running around killing each other as entertainment and as a reminder of The Capital's subjugation of the Districts) to Lord of the Flies, Running Man (read the novella; much better than the movie, especially the last scene for a book written in the eighties), 1984, the novella The Long Walk, even Ender's Game.    The only clue that this book is in the \\"Young Adult\\" category is the age and viewpoint of the main characters. I have read adult market books that also had the limited amount of intimacy and description. Getting kids to read is always a good thing and this book will do that.    Also this book is completely plausible (except for one little plot point but suspension of belief and lucky breaks is required for almost any novel).    Anyone who has any doubts about reading this book should order it right now and just plan on not getting anything done for a night or two.
0385738757|4.0|Damn, the tension in this book has left me in need of a massage.  I enjoyed The Scorch Trials more than I did the Maze Runner, though the delta is finite.  I love nothing more than a gritty, dystopian novel and this is it in spades.  The worldbuilding here was gratifying, slowly developing the history out of which WICKED was born.  The Scorch Trials was action packed, fast paced, and violently emotional.    My quibbles were few and relatively minor.  Primarily, I felt that the telepathy plot hasn't been used to its fullest potential.  In the first book Thomas could speak of his recovered memories after being Changed without freaking out, unlike others who'd been similarly infected, and I thought the explanatory workaround should have been to communicate silently through Theresa while she translated his message to the group thus bypassing self destruction.  There was also a missed opportunity in cultivating the relationship with Aris, a character who was introduced and then promptly fell by the wayside until he delivered the coup de grace, at which point I wasn't especially attached to the character and was less emotionally invested than I should have been. The telepathy hasn't seemed to serve a meaningful purpose in either book.     I don't mind cliffhangers and unanswered questions when they serve further the arc but I do feel we earned an explanation for what happened and why Theresa and Aris took Thomas into the room.  That is the only part that left me feeling cheated as it was such an integral, specific part of the climax of this particular book.    As the characters have matured, so to has the storyline.  The Scorch Trials was grander in every respect than the Maze Runner: in scope, setting, and characterization.  I highly recommend this book and series, especially to those who've enjoyed the Hunger Games and Chaos Walking.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|Great film, new Southern gothic. I agree with critic Derrick Bang: \\"This film is so far removed from soulless, bombastic crap such as Killers and Marmaduke that it shouldn't even be regarded as the same medium. Winter's Bone has the same pedigree -- the primarily unknown cast, the carefully constructed atmosphere of authenticity, the memorable script shaped by a skilled director -- that made The Hurt Locker such a similarly welcome alternative to Hollywood fare last year. I rather doubt Granik's film will go on to similar success -- it's awfully hard to watch, and its rewards are subtle -- but this much is certain: If Lawrence doesn't get an Oscar nod for her starring performance, there's no justice in this world.\\" More: [...]
B001HN69AY|5.0|Good wholesome fun, sparks the imagination of the viewer and luls you into the recesses of your mind!  Great acting!! Great Set Designs!!
B003UBTX7C|1.0|What a rip off! $14.99 for a book you can get at Costco for $15.99! Was at Costco earlier this evening and excited that I could come home and download this book - but, now, count me out.  This is ridiculous.  Amazon and others did a nice job of getting Kindle's and iPad's into the market - this is a good way to kill the enthusiasm and growth.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|I purchased this adapter when I discovered that my new MacBook Pro had a Firewire 800 port and my third party external back up drive (Maxtor) had the Firewire 400 connector!  I plugged in the adapter and was immediately prompted by Time Machine to set up the backup of my new MacBook Pro.  The Sonnet device works perfectly!
B0044XV3QY|3.0|I was tempted because it seemed like this should be in my collection - but to be honest after seeing the movie twice with different friends and family I just wasn't ready to sit through it again. I'll likely purchase this when it comes out - but what I'd really like to see on Blu-Ray is the Abyss Extended Edition - I hope they take a small chunk of change and get that together.
B003VANOFY|3.0|well sound by software for surround was fair with only one driver in each ear was another trick seemed solid for a build with plastic but I could not get the mic to work so I sent it back brought some wireless 5.1 with mutiple drivers. with no Mic I can get one for games. these cans are 2.8 Ghz. Sound is awesome for movies and wacthing movie channels dvd's, not to mention the puter games.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Ok, first off, let me get this out of the way, I am about a year late on hearing this CD, because no one around my area had it, I kept looking, and nothing, I could've ordered it, but I didn't, but finally, a year later, I found a copy!    Now within the last year to two years, thrash metal has made a statement, starting with Megadeth 'Endgame' which was an excellent return for them, and then this album came, and let's be frank, this album is purely Slayer, when you hear this, there is no doubt in your mind about what band it is, and honestly, I liked Slayer's last album 'Christ Illusion', actually, I like most Slayer, and this album did not disappoint me, now let's start with what Slayer is known for, Fast catchy riffs? Check, Manic double bass drum pounding? Check, Araya screaming his head off? Check, although some people don't like his newer vocal approach, but I like both his old and new style, and finally, Shredding solo's? CHECK!, It's all here folks, and I cannot understand why this album is getting so many bad reviews, ok, not everybody likes the same music, that's obvious, but I don't understand what other Slayer fans see in this album that makes them give it a bad review, it just sounds like...Slayer, which is what we all want I think.    But, for me, you can add this to the list of amazing thrash comebacks, which are Megadeth's 'Endgame' Slayer's 'World Painted Blood' Heathen's 'The Evolution of Chaos' Overkill's 'Ironbound' and Forbidden's 'Omega Wave' with releases like that, I think thrash metal is once again here to stay for a while, finally, some old men that still know how to thrash!
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|It is a shame that the stripped down version is only available as part of the double CD. However the new mix is truly a revelation and should not be missed. it is a wonderful release for all John's fans.

B001H9MYPW|5.0|In Treatment Series 2 (like Series 1) is just superb!  There is only one problem which couldn't possibly bring me to give it any less than the highest possible rating.  The problem for me is that the episodes are so short, being something like 22 minutes and I register a kind of not-quite-enoughness at the end of every watching ... something like being served a highly nutritious and delicious but skimpy meal.   I understand that each episode has to fit into a 30-minute TV time slot that would also include several commercials.  And I'll watch whatever they put out in the next series, but it would be even better, in my view, if they could add several more minutes to enhance the sessions and character development a bit more. Enough is a banquet, but not quite enough is still not enough.
B003F3PMYI|2.0|Looks like a decent book but I am clearly opposed to anyone publishing a Kindle edition without text-to-speech. I know there is an audio version but why should I have to purchase both. I will pass on either. I don't know if this was the authors decision or the publishers either way very disappointing.    I would have purchased this book if text-to-speech were enabled.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|There are many low score reviews purely based on the fact there was a release of this movie earlier this year and now the extended version comes out feels like a marketing game. When the first release happened it was known an extended version was coming, but some people just had to have it now. I just watched it on Netflix and waited for the extended version. I agree if you bought the first release version you have little real reason to buy the extended version, unless you love this movie and want the bonus features.     Some of the other low scores talk about the 3D version coming, but that is weak reason for most people because most do not own and will not own a 3D TV set. If you do your research on 3D TVs you will find they clunky and costly. Unless you are among the few who have a 3D TV, then there is no reason to wait to buy this release of Avatar if you enjoyed the movie.     For the few who have never seen the movie, the key factors to consider is if you are a science fiction fan, enjoy action movies, and if you consider yourself picky about dialog/originality, Avatar breaks no new ground when it comes to story, but it does take many of successful elements from other stories and rolls it into this one. The bashing on acting is overkill. In general they did a fine job, not exceptional, but anyone who loves science fiction will find the acting a step above the normal for this type of movie. The dialog is nothing special. There are mostly cliche characters and situations. The key is the entire package is very well done. No movie is perfect and as much as some people bash this, just look at the box office sales. Bad movies would have never set top sales records no matter how much marketing was behind it. This movie is not for everyone, but it is good to great entertainment for many.     BOTTOM LINE: If you loved the movie and do not own it, you might want to get this. If you have never seen the movie, rent it or barrow it first. It is a science fiction classic worth consideration for most people.
0061998494|4.0|The Book Report: Scottish prole grows up in emotionally chilly, physically cold as hell Glasgow, turns to drugs and alcohol to fill gaping emotional void, screws over a variety of people as all alkies do, and one day wakes up to learn he doesn't like himself, his life, or his future. Rehab, restitution, success, and true love follow.    My Review: I herewith confess: If Craig Ferguson was even a teensy hint queer, I'd be on a plane to Cali and camped on his doorstep with flowers, candy, and a leg iron. He amuses and impresses me even more after reading his pretty darned candid memoir.    I'm a complete pushover for a man in a kilt anyway, but when he can act and tell jokes the way this man can...! Ferguson, the host of \\"The Late Late Show,\\" made me laugh so hard I cried when he said of his son's mother: \\"No, really, she's a lovely woman. For legal purposes.\\" I heard nothing of his show for the next five minutes because I was shouting with laughter, and Mr. Man was a little put out that I kept referring to that line (okay, I shamelessly stole it, and I still use it, and unless I get a cease-and-desist letter I'm gonna keep right on) to the point of having a jealous fit. (Thanks, Craig!)    I am also a sucker for men who come to the USA with dreams of success and end up in love with our amazing, incredible, flawed, imperfect, conservatism-ridden paradise. Ferguson fell in love with the USA in its warty glory, and he rightly credits this astonishingly open society with a goodly measure of his own success. His talent plays an acknowledged role, but he makes sure to tell his readers that his life wouldn't be possible anywhere else. It's very heartening to me, and it's an instructive reminder that, problems and blemishes be damned, the rest of the world rightly and justly thinks we're on to something here.    Lastly, but far from least, I'm a complete sucker for a good story told by a good storyteller, and this book most certainly is that. Ferguson can't resist telling tales, no doubt polishing them up a wee bit, but not always in his own favor. He can't resist making light of things that sink many an alkie person's life, and sank his own, and thus takes the ponderousness out of the idea of recovery. I've read a fair bit of recovery literature but I'm always fatally put off by the earnest, well-meaning \\"Amazing Grace\\"-ness of it all. A person's personal spiritual awakening is, and should remain, just that: Personal. In other words, BELT UP ABOUT JESUS. Ferguson not only does, he makes it clear that he has a BIG problem with religion. *swoon* My lands, just when I thought he couldn't get more magnetically, hypnotically gorgeously attractive!    So should others read this? Yes. It's fun, funny, and touching; it's honest and it's gritty; and in the end, it's a pleasure to get to know Craig Ferguson as well as if he were the bloke on the barstool next over.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|What can you say about the phrasing? He was (is) simply the master. If a young vocalist in the pop venue wants to emotionally touch his audience, then Sinatra here is an excellent tutor. Tony Bennett is another master. He no longer has the strong voice of his youth. However, because of the lack of strength, he seems to have somehow focused more on his extraordinary phrasing, even now in his eighth decade. I have the marvelous fortune to live in Vegas, and each time Bennett appears here at the Hilton, I am somewhere in the first three rows bathing in this superb music. He frequently refers to Sinatra. Tony is the last of the masters. Sad, but beautiful to experience and hear.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I don't care what any annoying little Bookworm say's, This in my opinion is the Best Harry Potter movie of the franchise, and that's saying a lot because I loved all the movies and the books.    To the people who Bash the HP movies, you need to realize something. Books and Movies are Two completely different things, stop comparing them. ALL of the Harry Potter movies are absolutely great, the only reason you people have a problem with them is because they aren't \\"Exactly\\" like the book, well guess what? That's impossible, Hollywood will never release a 7 hour movie and expect it to make money. I personally think every HP movie is great in it's own way :) :) :)
B003XL6EKS|5.0|Read my other reviews and you'll notice a pattern. I'll let everyone else debate the merits of the album. This review is for those eager to buy the album but are still deciding about know which version to get.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD Versus CD? - Depends on sale price<br />If the download is still sale priced at or below five clams when you see this AND you're just a casual fan - I'd go download. It's an incredible deal. Sonically, there's not much a difference in sound the way this album is mixed.<br /><br />CD Versus Deluxe CD?<br />The one thing the regular edition of the CD has going for it is the traditional jewel case. An easier to access CD and a booklet that won't get worn down too easily. The Deluxe edition is in an annoying DigiPak - the type where you need to seriously wrestle with it to remove the disc without snapping it in half. Once I liberated mine, I re-housed it in a regular slimline case. The colorful booklet is stitched into the digipak case, which looks lovely, but needs to be handled with white gloves to preserve it's condition. In an odd move, the side pocket that could have housed the CD (preferred) or booklet is instead stuffed with a 2-sided mini poster. Clearly, they are going after the tween girl demographic with this move, but if my phantom baby daughter tucked a poster of a 30-year old man in her locker, I would buy her some Bieber stat.<br /><br />The main reason to go Deluxe is the 4 bonus tracks. You get \\"The Clock Was Ticking\\" - a Grand Ole Opry country romp that also recalls the lyrical pace of The Nails' \\"88 Lines for 44 Women\\" and Jim Carrol's \\"People Who Died.\\" \\"Jacksonville\\" is an album highlight - a trippy number with a slinky beat and a chilling woven bass guitar line. \\"I Came Here To Get Over You\\" almost sounds like a great lost Weezer song and \\"Right Behind You\\" brings the album to a proper close with heavy wet synths.<br /><br />Overall - this album, even more than the b-sides comp \\"Sawdust\\" feels like a full-fledged Killers album. I recently bought solo outings from Paul Banks (Interpol) and Julian Casablancas (The Strokes) - both tread new territory, but were so sterile they left me little inspiration for repeat listens. Flamingo is much more warm and inviting, like Las Vegas luring headlights down Highway 15 in the dead of night.m Paul Banks (Interpol) and Julian Casablancas (The Strokes) - both tread new territory, but were so sterile they left me little inspiration for repeat listens.

B0044IJ1S6|4.0|I have been a DM fan since 1986, they are my Beatles or Rolling Stones. I love everything they release. This Blu-ray is good but there are things that are annoying.  One of the coolest parts of a concert is the entrance of the band. The filming at the begining was so annoying I couldn't even watch the whole thing. There was way to much of the fans and not enough DM. This being the bands first Blu-ray release its annoying when any good shot of the band goes blurred. When the person filming finally stops focusing on the crowds cell phones and shows the band he blurs them?    Anyway don't worry it did get better way better! The audio mix I thought was the best yet. Nice rich sound and loud. Dave was awsome his voice I thought sounded way good. Don't let my opinion about the first song scare you, this is still a must buy. It's not Devotional but it is up there. Maybe next time Anton will be behind the lens.
1603425381|5.0|I have never seen a book like this before. It's full of borders that are truly breathtaking. It has all the instructions, clear and easy to follow, includes tips on making your stuff even nicer. I do not regret a sinle cent spent on this book.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I have to say first, that I wasn't expecting to much about her like a writer and she really surprised me, was a very good job. I just bought a Kindle, and after watched her interview on Oprah, I decided to downloaded the book.    Positive, I find the book really interesting, She doesn't decided to be anorexic and however she is not blaming her mother for that, but if i was her, I would do it.. The way that she describes the relation with her mother, her comments about weight and how her mother was cheering her up to lost weight. Also the homosexuality was a principal factor to become an anorexic, I think that being an anorexic was her way to say \\"Mama I love you, Do you like how I look like? Can you love me again and no be dissapointed of me because I'm gay\\".     I have to accept that I cry reading this, She was killing herself for nothing and she didn't notice that she was sick.. I felt attached to the book because my sister had an eating disorder in the past years and the story really touch like she was her.     So this book is really devastating but with the epilogue we could see that she could make it and she finally got better.. I recommend this book to everybody except if you have an eating disorder, I would rather it if she wasn't so especific with his diet and the rituals.
1603420398|5.0|As with Crochet borders by the same author, this book too is truly phenomenal. The internet is full of free square patterns but in comparison with those listed in this book they seem more than dull. The author goes through the basics, includes info on color combinations and how they can dramatically change the look of the square, inlcudes information on joing the motifs together and then goes on listing a whole bunch of breathtaking motifs that you will not see anywhere else and (duh!) tells you how to make them. This book is totally worth its cost and I bet even more than that. I totally recommend it and do not regret a single cent I spent for it.

0066620996|5.0|This was recommended to me by two unrelated people and I have not been disappointed.   This is not just for people in business but for anyone involved in organizational leadership. A must have!  It is thoroughly researched with lots of data and sound analysis and conclusions.   The advantage with this work is that it seems to begin with data not a hypothesis. This makes the findings more authoritative.  Easy style to read, practical, and his concepts are easily applicable to most organizational structures.  JD

B000002HRE|1.0|Unless you are a fan of Load to begin with, I don't think anyone in their right mind would think leftover tracks from that recording would be a good idea for an entire new album.  Isn't the \\"Memory Remains\\" one of the stupidest things you have ever heard...c'mon...admit it.  I can understand people maybe liking Load for what it is, something different, but how hackneyed is calling leftover tracks, \\"RELOAD\\".  I guess after Load Bob Rock wasn't able to pinch anything else from them so he said, \\"All right guys lets just re-tool the crap from the last one.\\"  I'm sure they didn't put up a fight, they're rich now.

0312370849|4.0|My cousin and my friend both recommended this book. I thought it was wonderful! It isn't for children as it has to do with concentration camps and the atrocities during World War II. The author doesn't use sensationalism to make her points: she doesn't need it.  I would highly recommend the book to anyone who has an interest in history and World War II. Although the story itself is fictitious, the events are real. Most of us had no idea!

I downloaded this book to my Kindle with intentions of getting to it over Christmas break.  Made the mistake of starting it last night.  Couldn't put it down.  Incredibly well researched, meticulously written, bluntly honest and a story that captures both the heart and the mind.  And right now as a grad student all I do is find flaws with books, so that's pretty high praise.  Read it.
B002ZG98ZA|2.0|I'm a huge fan of SATC.  Own the boxset and bought one for a friend as a gift.  Liked the first movie a lot.  With that as a backdrop, for me, SATC2 was a huge disappointment.  It has its moments, to be sure.  I found myself laughing really hard several times at some of the lines (\\"Holy Mother of God, what's with the gut?\\"), but overall, this is just a very weak movie.  The writing is lame and the plot is boring.  And whose idea was it to take the show that was defined by its location out of New York City and take it to the UAE?  Whosever it was has, in my opinion, damaged the franchise with what has to be the dumbest idea to manifest itself in a major film release in a while.  Maybe it was time to retire it anyway.  Personally, I'm still a big enough fan to give them another chance.  I just hope they get a fresh writing and production team next time - and, please take it back to New York City where it belongs.  Any time you have a core team of actors that gelled as well as this one did, the fan base always gets a feeling of coming home in just seeing the characters come to life again with new material, and I got that feeling from this movie as well (and hope to get it again with a better follow-up).  Beyond that, though, it has little going for it.
0007256531|5.0|The author explains his points clearly, and oftentimes sprinkled with humor and wit. The book offers observations about human behavior that are interesting, and perhaps counter-intuitive. For example, we humans have a hard time determining the value of something without comparing it to something else. That comparator can be manipulated to change how valuable we consider something to be.<br /><br />I also really liked the fact that the author actually conducted many of the experiments himself. He does a good job of designing and executing worthwhile studies to gain insight into our human nature. (Though he doesn't always mention or consider the sample sizes used when drawing his conclusions based on his studies.)<br /><br />Overall - entertaining and very informative. I highly recommend this book, and I hope to read more from this author in the future.

0812975219|4.0|I originally expected this book to be a treatise on human beliefs, behaviors, and randomness. It turned out to have a more narrative feel; the author ponders and self-reflects, as well as informs the reader. The Monte Carlo experiments the author conducts, and the interesting studies he mentions, give useful insights into how easily we are fooled by randomness. One last note - this book is not really about the stock market. The author is an ex- options trader; his experience with stocks is merely a backdrop to his relating to randomness.
142313494X|4.0|Percy Jackson is not your typical ADHD teenager. Yes he has trouble making friends, and yes he has trouble with his schoolwork. He loves his mother, and doesn't get along with his step-loser. All typical. The difference is he's the son of one of the top three gods of Mt. Olympus. Now he has to come of age on a quest that may take him from his comfortable boarding shool, to Mt. Olympus, to the depths of the underworld. He also has to save the world from an impending war between the gods themselves. No pressure.<br /><br />I loved the greek mythology set in the modern day. A very fun read for anybody who can.

It is set in Germany in the second world war and illustrates the hardships the German population suffered, and touches on the plight of the persecution of the Jews under Hitler's regime.

0545123275|2.0|I wanted to love this book. The cover is stark and attention-grabbing, and the first few chapters are too.  On the first page, you meet the protaganist Grace who is in the middle of a snowy forest, surrounded by wolves.  The author does such a great job setting the mood I could almost feel the cold.  The writing is subtle and lyrical, and I was excited to see how the story unfolded. Unfortunately, page one is the book's high point.      For reasons that are never explained, and are more than a little creepy, Grace is obsessed with the wolves outside her house and her only interest in life appears to be staring at them for days on end. Her two \\"friends\\" are some of the worst one- dimensional, underdeveloped characters I've come across in any book, ever. Here is one particularly cringe-inducing line of dialogue from one of these teen girls \\"I hate when my peeps can't play nice with each other.\\"  It's like the author was writing out of an outdated phrase book of how teens talk.      When Grace finally meets Sam, the wolf she's been watching all these years, it is, of course, love at first sight. That wouldn't be so bad if the author had attempted to keep some kind of suspense and intrigue in the developing relationship, making the reader eager to know more as the characters get to know each other. I like to see tension, and apprehension and nerves, and all those exciting feelings that go with adolescent love. Instead, the author turns the characters into an old married couple from the day they meet. From the onset, they sleep in the same bed every night, do everything together, and their idea of a romantic, wild date is taking a road trip to a candy store.  Snooze.  Twilight may not go down in history as the greatest book ever, but Stephanie Meyer knows something about eroticism and the slow, maddening, build up of desire.  Don't expect to find any of that here.     Sam is impossible to buy as a teen boy. He describes things as \\"lovely\\" and \\"yummy\\" and is constantly thinking in poetry and lyrics that is supposedly deep, but is really cheesy and lame. The \\"cure\\" at the end feels desperatly contrived, and it is entirely inexplicable why anyone would want to be a werewolf under this author's rules- unlike stories where the paranormal characters are immortal and have superpowers, the werewolves in this story are just wolves, with no powers of human thought, who will die after a short life.  And yet we're supposed to believe that people would want to become wolves? Or that Sam's choice to walk away from them is hard? I don't buy it. And Grace is whiny, petulant, devoid of passion or interests in life outside of Sam. Give me a break.     Finally, the author spends a lot of time on crap that adds nothing to the story. The color of lights is described on almost every page. The characters are constantly talking about coffee, and drinking coffee, and wanting coffee.  Far too many pages are spent on long, detailed descriptions of cooking and eating. More attention should have been given to developing conflict and a believable villian.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I was delighted to hear that this terrific film was coming to Blu-Ray. I had missed out on the DVD version in the past before the film was put back in \\"the vault.\\" Although I suspect anyone reading this review already is aware that this is a great movie I can't resist putting in my two cents that this is Disney at its best. I always thought Belle served as a wonderful role model for kids with her love of books and learning - it somehow makes her more three-dimentional than some of the other princesses. The story in this film has a nicer arc and just flows better with all the characters growing and developing (well, maybe not Mr. Antlers-In-All-My-Decorating). I must admit that the lack of a major parental figure dying also is quite appealing as that seems to happen so often in Disney films. Anyway, this is a terrific story well told and back in the day I was very much hoping it would be awarded Best Picture.<br /><br />What you are probably reading this for, however, is an assessment of the picture quality / sound quality on the blu-ray and I can tell you it is superb. I was impressed with the detail visible in the animations, it was like seeing the movie in the theatre. Sound is also excellent. My kids (5 and 7) both had only seen part of the movie on a dim-looking laserdisc (yes, I'm one of the few who still has a working laserdisc player in my home) - and this presentation really got their attention. We also watched the interviews with the cast of the Broadway show and that was a fun feature. We haven't ventured to the second 'special features' disc yet. The inclusion of a DVD is a nice touch as it will see service in our car soon.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent presentation of what IMHO is Disney's finest work.

B003RNXIBK|5.0|I'm not really into rap but there were a few songs by Eminem that I liked. For the most part I thought he was just like all the other rap artists out there.   Then I heard \\"I'm not afraid\\" and \\"I like the way it hurts\\" and decided to give Recovery a chance. Well it paid off big time.  Most of the songs have some sort of moral value and candid looks into his past.  An other great song is \\"Going Through Changes\\" which is about addiction, suicide, and redemption.  I also found \\"Talking To Myself\\" to be yet an other amazing song.  There  is one song I refused to put on my iPod. \\"Seduction\\" It seems to condone cheating if it with someone that's better for you.  Over all Recovery is a great cd. And that's coming from a guy that stays within the bounds or metal/rock/alternative/and punk.

This is a must-have in your comic library and makes a memorable gift to anyone you know who loves graphic novels. Batman is sharp, Catwoman and Poison Ivy are incredible. Not sure why Superman made a cameo here, but otherwise a strong story.

And I cannot quibble with the fine job Warner Brothers did on the video and sound quality of this wonderful blu-ray disc. And all of the extras are really great, and there are hours of fine entertainment to be had by purchasing this movie. SO WHY DID SOME IDIOT PUT A PICTURE OF ERROL FLYNN FROM \\" THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER\\" ON THE DISC ITSELF? That's right, a beardless Flynn from the 1937 film is the artwork some moron used to stamp the disc - check it out for yourself.
0143036556|2.0|Jared Diamond can type a lot of words, but he says very little. Much of the info is repetitive and rote as you can skim through all the historical chapters without missing anything. As others have noted, Diamond's failing is that he makes broad assumptions without evidence early on and it corrodes his credibility from the start. Overall, a terrible book I recommend you skip. Read the summary and you'll know enough to save your money.
0743243153|5.0|How I got the book:<br />Gift from a family member<br /><br />Background:<br />M. Scott Peck, M.D. was a psychiatrist who wrote a number of books about life, spirituality, psychiatry, and growth. Over the course of his psychiatry career he collected stories, developed ideas, and ultimately wrote about these things. The Road Less Traveled, first published in 1978, was his first big success as an author and helped to make him famous.<br /><br />The Road Less Traveled was a very striking book. It started with a stark acknowledgment: \\"life is difficult\\". Instead of being a downer, Peck proceeded to describe his \\"new psychology\\" in terms that were ultimately uplifting to the reader who was prepared to do some reading and thinking with an open mind.<br /><br />The strengths:<br />Peck divided his book into four sections:<br /><br />Discipline<br />Love<br />Growth and Religion<br />Grace<br />Each section is filled with compelling writing about the topics as well as anecdotes based on his own psychiatric practices and from his personal life.<br /><br />Peck was a clear writer and wrote well. His concept of discipline (tied to the important principle of delaying pleasure for future benefit) and his insights into the nature of love, particularly on how it can and does change over time, may seem a bit foreign to an \\"instant gratification\\", \\"always on\\" culture, but they make a heck of a lot of sense to anyone who has perservered and triumphed over adversity, as most people do over the course of a life. Love isn't just a romantic, happy, pleasureable feeling: it's a source of strength and courage that can help fuel discipline.<br /><br />The two sections related to religion and grace go beyond the tangible and practical into more philosophical discussions of spirituality and humanity. They foreshadow the subject matter of the book's sequel, Further Down The Road Less Traveled, but, in my opinion, are more palatable than in the sequel, where Peck's religious and spiritual agenda came to dominate that book in a more forceful fashion.<br /><br />I'll make no bones about it, including my own personal bias: this is an excellent book. It will forever be one of my personal favorites, certainly a top three book. My own life and experiences have undoubtedly given me a personal bias towards this book, but at the same time this permits me to write, with authority, that it's a great book and the ideas work. Period.<br /><br />The areas for improvement:<br />One of the common critiques of Peck's worth was that he overemphasized the difficulties of life and he also came up with an ultimately pragmatic, unromantic view of love. It's possible that he went too far.<br /><br />At the same time, though, there's so much writing that sugarcoats and creates pleasurable fantasies about the nature of romantic love that the psychic \\"kick in the pants\\" is probably necessary for many many people. As far as I'm concerned, this isn't much of an area for improvement, although it's worth noting that Peck himself failed to live up to these ideals on a number of occasions, which ultimately lead to estrangement from his children and the end of his marriage only one year before his death in 2005, although he did remarry prior to dying.<br /><br />However, these failings are more about the man himself, not his ideas. Thus, it's really, really hard to critique this book: it is what it is.<br /><br />Other points of interest:<br />The Road Less Traveled was re-released in a 25th anniversary edition, which I haven't seen.

1449389627|5.0|The premise of this book is pretty simple:  behind the myths of innovation - the stories and fables that portray genius, instant astounding success - lies real stories of grinding, failures and eventual, infrequent success.  So, the bad news is that being innovative is like being a baseball batter:<br /><br />- much more failure than success<br />- lots of practice and skill building work<br />- safe hits (e.g. singles, doubles and triples), punctuated by the occasional home run and surrounded by a cloud of strikeouts, walks, and being caught out.<br /><br />Enough \\"inside baseball\\".  Heh.<br /><br />This book is important because it disputes, quite effectively, myths or misconceptions about the successful innovator.  Among the bubbles that it bursts include:<br /><br />- Where ideas come from and how we get them<br />- The type of people that famous inventors really were (I tend to think that Thomas Edison was a big jerk, to be honest, especially after reading this book)<br />- How well people embrace new ideas<br />- Whether or not the \\"lone inventor\\" is real<br />- Whether or not your superiors are really more creative or innovative than you are<br />- Whether or not the best idea always wins<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />Throughout, Berkun is straight forward in his approach and he digs in to the history of innovation to a respectable level of depth.  Between his footnotes and resource pages, I feel comfortable that Berkun did a good job at researching the background material and poking holes in it, combining a journalist's approach and diligence (at least in an ideal sense) with a writer's skill at making the material interesting.<br /><br />I try to poke holes in virtually every book I read, so I did the same with Berkun's book.  Or at least I tried to.  Granted, I did not spend a huge amount of time trying to tear his book apart, but I feel confident that there are no obvious flaws in the book.  It is important, however, to recognize what this book is not.  It is not a manual or textbook on how to be innovative although the entire book basically infers, implies or downright confirms that you can be innovative and provides some good material to back it up.<br /><br />I think this is a great book.  That doesn't mean that it's designed for everyone.  But if you have an interest in doing and making new things, this book is an important resource.sically infers, implies or downright confirms that you can be innovative and provides some good material to back it up.

B003XMUFGQ|4.0|I really didn't expect much after reading reviews. But, this is suprisingly good. My only complaint is he didn't write many of the songs. I guess that was intended to be like that. It also doesn't rock out like some other albums, but it isn't that type of album.
0385528752|5.0|How I got the book:<br />I received a review copy from the publisher.<br /><br />Background:<br />Chip Heath and Dan Heath (yes, they are brothers) are a couple of smart and talented guys who have been successful in academia and in business. They received global attention and praise for their thought-provoking book Made To Stick, which described various ways to make content or messages memorable enough to \\"stick\\" in our minds.<br /><br />Switch, in a nutshell, is about change:  how difficult it is and ways to successfully introduce change. The brothers Heath look at different aspects of making change and why it can be so difficult for people to embrace change. Their concepts of the Elephant, the Rider, and the Path seem to be \\"sticking\\" in the minds of many readers as a means to visualize how and why change works.<br /><br />The strengths:<br />As chef Emeril would say, \\"BAM!\\" This is an excellent book on many levels. It's easy to read, full of useful facts and examples, and it includes case studies (often based on real life examples) to illustrate how change was introduced into various situations. The Heath brothers also provide examples of situations where change was not successfully introduced.<br /><br />This book is compelling and important. The authors do an excellent job of introducing concepts and then building upon them to help reinforce our understanding. They've applied the concepts from Made to Stick when writing this book to make it memorable.<br /><br />The areas for improvement:<br />There is not a damn thing wrong with this book.  You need a copy.<br /><br />Other points of interest:<br />Some of the change examples in the book seem shocking because they seem like such obvious changes that would be so beneficial to many, yet they were difficult to make, including several examples from the health care industry. It's a sobering look at how organizations work.
0890090572|5.0|Being a long time fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyles' Sherlock Holmes books, I was thrilled to borrow this book from a dear friend. Wonderful illustration's of this<br />character and enjoyed every momemt of reading again, I had to have my own copy!
0060005696|4.0|How I got the book:<br />It was a Christmas present, on my list. I'm serious.<br /><br />Background:<br />Barry Schwartz is an American psychology professor who has written extensively on the impact of choice on individuals.  He has focused on the impact of having a great deal (perhaps too much) of choices for many of our daily decisions.  The Paradox of Choice contains various arguments as to why having too many choices can result in misery and problems rather than happiness and satisfaction.  The book is divided into four sections:<br /><br />I.  When We Choose<br /><br />II.  How We Choose<br /><br />III.  Why We Suffer<br /><br />IV.  What We Can Do<br /><br />The first three sections deal with the nature of making choices and possible negative results from having too many options.  The final section presents eleven recommendations on how we can better handle the wide ranges of choices available to us.<br /><br />The strengths:<br />There is no question in my mind that this is an important book that everyone should read.  Schwartz clearly and comprehensively makes a case that having too many choices, or options, available to us in our lives can lead to unhappiness.<br /><br />The areas for improvement:<br />After spending a great deal of time building a case for choice overload, Schwartz spends very little time on possible solutions to these problems.  Several of them were foreshadowed throughout the book and the entire list, when put together, isn't very inspiring.<br /><br />Other points of interest:<br />Although they aren't addressed in this book, I think this book can shed some insight into the longer term impact of Twitter and of \\"free\\" products.

0061339202|5.0|How I got the book:<br />Bought my own copy<br /><br />Background:<br />Csikszentmihalyi is a psychologist who has been studying humans at work and play for decades, with a particular focus on discovering the conditions in which human beings achieve states of happiness, satisfaction, and engagement with what they are doing.  Flow is his attempt to explain these ideas to a large, mainstream audience.<br /><br />The strengths:<br />This book gives a lot of great information about ways that people derive enjoyment, engagement, and happiness in the work they do.  His definition of psychic entropy was a particular revelation for me:  the idea that a mind at rest tends to fill up with negative and occasionally crazy thoughts (OK, this is a slight exaggeration, but still).  The author shares his thoughts and observations on how anyone can try to find fulfillment and satisfaction through mental and physical pursuits.<br /><br />Generally speaking, this is just a great book about finding happiness and satisfaction in your life by looking for quite a spectrum of experiences to full engage yourself.<br /><br />The areas for improvement:<br />As good and wonderful as this book is, it can be a bit of a tough slog, especially for today's reader who scans and looks for landmarks rather than taking a book one word at a time.<br /><br />Other points of interest:<br />I have read any of the author's other books, but I'm looking forward to checking out his book on creativity.  He also gave a very interesting TED presentation about flow that you can find on the Web.
B0025KW29U|5.0|I first saw this movie in streaming form and was hooked.  I've seen it over a dozen times now and have bought the soundtrack for it as well.  It's short (too short for big fans) but perfect.  The acting and singing is wonderful and Neil Patrick Harris is a wonderful super villan.  Even my kids love it (we mute 2 parts that aren't fully appropriate for them)
B0041T52S6|4.0|Are you a dork? Are you a hipster? Were you a dork who as you got older became a hipster? Then absolutely yes, this movie is for you.    Does it make sense? Made sense to me, but I file into the above statement. It is a crazy awesome movie that has it's own logic, embraces it and just keeps on going never really stopping to question the reality of everything. I believe the academic adjective to attach to it is \\"surreal.\\" Why can Scott Pilgrim suddenly fly through the air? How is it that giant monsters form from the beats of rock bands at a battle of the bands concert and fight it out over a crowd of adoring fans? What is the deal with the vegan police?     These are the sort of questions that you just have to accept and run with if you are going to enjoy this movie. It's a feast on the eyes, full of action and tons of hipster type humor.       Do you like FLCL? Do you even know what FLCL is? If the answer is yes to both of these questions than absolutely yes you will enjoy this movie.     I will say that sometimes it does feel rushed. I wish more time was spent on the seven evil X's and developing them as more, I don't know, comically evil? Dare I say it might have benefited from being stretched into 2 flicks. But that's pretty much just wishful thinking on my part.    I loved this movie. I wish it did better in theaters than it did. But I can easily see room for a lot of people not quite \\"getting\\" it. If you haven't seen it before and you're not a hipster type, rent it first.
0451169514|3.0|I really liked this book up to about the last third.  Seriously, it is as though he just gave up.  The end of this book ruins what was a masterfully crafted work up to the point where it simply falls off.    You will like it, and then you will be disappointed.
B0040JHLM2|4.0|I ordered both the GTS 10 and the GTS 11, having moved up from GTS 7 and GTS 8. I skipped the GTS 9 line due to not having liked how it fit my feet when I tried it on at a running store.    There really isn't a lot of bad things I can say about the shoe, so I'll compare it with the GTS 7, 8, 10, and 11.    About me:  I'm 5'8\\" 165lbs, and medium distance runner (6-9 miles or 45 minutes to an hour), no to mild pronation, low to medium arch, narrow to medium feet width.    Comfort: The GTS 10 really feels the most comfortable, and is a bit like how the GTS 8 fit around my feet. The GTS 11 feels a lot like the GTS 7 in terms of comfort. They are all really comfortable, but as far as fitting goes, the GTS 10 really molds around my feet perfectly, but a little more so than the GTS 8.    Cushion: The GTS 10 provides the best cushion for the balls of my feet, the most solid arch support, and heel cushioning. The GTS 11 felt a little low in the arch department, and didn't have as much cushioning at the heels. It's a little lighter, so I feel as though I could run faster, but doesn't feel as good when keeping a steady pace.    Durability: The GTS 7 and GTS 8 both lasted a good solid 1-2 years, replacing the insoles every couple of months. I've yet to see how the GTS 10 and GTS 11 fare.    After-run thoughts: My most notable pain I feel when running is not in my knees or ankles, but my shins. The GTS 7, 8, and 11 just don't give me the cushioning I need to ease the pain from my shins (I have off and on shin splints). The GTS 10 seems to take the pain away from my shins, and I really feel great after a run!    That's it for my brief review. In short, the GTS 10 feels like a better upgrade over the GTS 8, and the GTS 11 feels like a better upgrade over the GTS 7. Everyone's body and feet and running behavior is different, but if you somewhat resemble my stature, running length/speed, and feet type, I highly recommend the GTS 10.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read this novel based on a recommendation and was so glad that I did. It deftly captures the anxieties of high school and the less Chbosky dwells on monumental issues, the more the reader feels for Charlie. Very well constructed and a great read.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|When you watch Josh Fox's brilliant GASLAND, it's as if you're watching a nightmare scenario of what would happen if our lands were taken over by evil aliens, intent on sucking the earth dry, regardless of the consequences to the planet--and to us. This is no sci-fi thriller that could never happen in real life, however. Shockingly, it IS really happening and it's worse than you can imagine.    Very fortunately, for all of us, Josh Fox, brave soul that he is, ventured out into the heart of America and into the small towns of this country to actually speak to regular, law abiding, tax paying citizens who are now paying the ultimate price for \\"clean\\" gas drilling with permanent health effects, including brain damage, chronic respiratory conditions and many other serious conditions, too numerous to mention. Their land is worthless, their water undrinkable. The now famous scene where the tap water actually bursts into flame is just the tip of the iceburg. The epidemic of hydrofracking now taking place in America is worse than any disease we've ever encountered. It destroys our water, our air, our animals, our vegetation (including farm crops), our livestock, our health and our lives. This is Three Mile Island, Love Canal and Chernobyl--times fifty.     GASLAND should be shown in every elementary, high school and college classroom. At least that way, when our children grow into adults, they will know why there is no such thing anymore as fresh water in America. And they will know who was responsible.
B002BWQ586|2.0|The concept behind this book is good, as described by other reviewers, so I won't bother to repeat it here.     Sadly the undercurrent operating beneath this story is rather cartoonish and lamentably reactionary. As a result it is often laughably predictable and occasionally dim-witted. To give a few examples: The US president is brave, fearless and intelligent, a myth that I've noticed many right wing authors follow - but one that seems sadly missing from any US President since Roosevelt. Even George Bush's reaction to 9/11 would have been a little more realistic that the Independence Day super-president Brooks portrays. You have to chuckle at the way Americans deify their leaders; it's just sad that they actually seem to believe their own fairytales.    Across the Atlantic, the Queen of Britain is equally noble and self sacrificing, as are generals and various military personel described throughout. Israel are the good guys, and the Palestinians little more than Fox News cartoons.    In summary - to make the unbelievable believable it is necessary to place the fantastical in the most realistic context possible (think HG Well's War of the Worlds), and in this Brooks fails dismally; instead creating a zombie apocalypse within the framework of a Republican's wet dream.    Fail.
0060557818|4.0|If your in to original this is it.  My wife and I loved it.  It has a nice story and good characters.  The ending was even good.  Its not a long book but its one you could read a few time.
0399536108|5.0|Do not come to this book thinking it will show you exactly how to break out of a routine life and do something extraordinary. It doesn't.    But what it does do is show you that you *can* do something extraordinary, and it gives you the permission to do so. Those are powerful things.     Chris Guillebeau changed my life. His writing on The Art of Non-Conformity website - [...] - has become required reading. His work has helped push me to make big decisions, to strive to do only what I love, and to work as hard as I can to make the world a better place. While I had to have the ideas and plans, he gave me the push to put them in motion.     What's great about AONC is, even if you want to live a more \\"conventional\\" life (say with a location-based job, or not traveling all the time), its principles still work. Guillebeau's strategies on how to build and engage your \\"small army\\" should be required reading in marketing classes, and his critical view of higher education challenges the bachelor's/master's/doctorate roadmap that has now become mandatory for success.     If you've always wanted to do something daring, there is no better jumpstart than this book.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I bought this on a chance.  My wife and I love it but we are pretty open minded.  We both enjoy watching it from time to time.
B003EY7IUY|5.0|I have always loved this character and never get tired of the crazy situations she finds herself in. Even after so many of these have been written, the author still finds ways to keep the story fresh and entertaining without losing any of the Becky qualities we love so much. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book, all the characters, new and old, and I'd forgotten how much I missed Becky Bloomwood!
B001P06GX4|5.0|We got this game for my son when he was 6.  We all have fun playing it!  I respectfully disagree with the person that said it's no fun with only 3 players.  Even with 2 it seems like we have a tough time fitting the pieces on at the end.  It always starts out and you think \\"there's no way I'm not going to get all these pieces on\\" but at the end it always gets tough!  Great strategy game for sure!
0439023521|5.0|you don't have to be a young adult to enjoy this. i stayed up until 2am to finish it. really really great.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I'm sad I finished it. The puzzle that takes place as the novel unfolds is amazing. It did take me about 40 pages to get into, but once I was into it, I couldn't put it down. I was scared and guessing the whole time and I have to say I haven't read something this good in a long time. Books like this are hard to come by. I recommend to everyone. I hope they make a movie because my imagination was going wild the whole time. 10/10.
0810995522|4.0|It is a good book,and it is interesting book.It is a strong paper back book to read from.It has alot of pages,but out of all of that it is very good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow...best series I've read since Harry Potter....so far since there's only 2. I cannot wait for the third of the series. It is a long wait...After the first book, I thought the second would hardly measure up but I was happily proved wrong. I got hooked right from the beginning and read the whole book through in a matter of days. Perfect summer reading books. Love it.
B002M2N9JI|5.0|La Roux in my opinion is one of the best newcomers of 2009. I had not heard something in \\"old-school\\" British pop - strong but gentle vocal with synthetic piano for at least 10 years. I really love lyrics so \\"Quicksand\\" impresses me much because of it, it is simple but frank.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow...what an amazing series. I found this book to be the weakest of the 3, but ultimately very well done. It took a little while for the action to pick up, but I was never bored. Once it did pick up, it reminded me more of the other 2 novels. I was very much on the end of my seat the entire time and had no idea what would happen by the end. It was much darker than the previous 2, but I have no qualms with that. If I had one critique, I would say the ending was a little rushed and maybe not explained out as well as I would have hoped, (though I only just finished it and usually, I like to reflect a bit before I fully decide). I in no way saw the twist at the end coming and cried at the shock of it. Overall, this book is well worth the read, and rounds out the series very very well. Greatest series since Harry Potter and I can't wait for the movies now...<br />9/10
B0007Y08II|5.0|If you have a good sense of humor, and you don't think anything is off limits, then this movie will have you rolling on the floor.  Seeing the puppets walk is in itself funny.  I recommend having a little background with America's foreign policies, North Korea, and the musical Rent.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It's the middle of the night and I just wrapped up this awesome novel. Two wins for Dashner, because this book and its predecessor are superb and actually pretty scary. This is a dystopian novel and, like the Hunger Games Trilogy, it is packed with suspense and adventure. I found there to be a few more likenesses between this book and the Hunger Games than I did with The Maze Runner, but it does have a much more sci-fi plot. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire novel (which totally leaves you hanging, begging for the next chapter) and I have a feeling this series will take off soon enough into an amazing franchise. Definite fave, can't wait for the third. 10/10
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I havent seen this movie since i was in the 4th or 5th grade, ive thought about it over the years i finally got around to searching it out, i cant wait to watch this as is snows.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing and wonderful in every way...I would recommend it to anyone. Having read The Maze Runner before this fantastic book and having heard the comparison, I have to say, I didn't really see one at all. Minus the fact that both are part of a trilogy and both take place in a post-apocalyptic world, they are very different. The whole idea of the book and the author's vivid descriptions are what make it so good. I can't wait for the movie adaptation and I hope they do it justice. For now, I'll just wait till I can go out tomorrow night and get the second part of this trilogy, since I absolutely loved the first one. Best book I've read in awhile definitely, and for sure, one of my favorites. 10/10 Stars.

Great quality in standard def.I think a lot of fans are waiting  on blu ray,but I think this transfer is up to par.      I only paid $15.00 @ FYE W/ my discount ,which is a little  better than Amazon as of this writing.      This live concert dvd will be in my rotation for a long time.      Much better than Inside the Nine dvd.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is very well done, extremely informative, and tremendously engaging. It provided a wide array of information, and personal stories as an example. I think it should be required watching for every person in an industrialized nation, especially America.<br /><br />Genetically engineering your food, refusing to accurately label your foods, creating mega monopolies, placing their officials in your gov't overseeing policies concerning them, strong arming farmers, suing farmers for using their own seeds, torturing animals, poisoning people, encouraging illegal imigration and getting away with it, and even depriving YOU of your right to free speech?!? Veterans day was yesterday, honor the veterans in your life by standing up against the food industry dictatorship that is stripping your country of its health, wealth, well being and FREEDOM!!! Every item you purchase is a vote, make sure YOU are voting for the right things!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I started this book months ago after reading the Oprah book review. The story is told from the point of view of Enzo, a dog with so much heart and love for his family. I downloaded this to read on my kindle while I travel and found myself smiling, laughing, crying in the airport as I became a part of Enzo's story. I just finished it today after setting it aside....I really did not want the story to end. It changed my perspective and warmed my heart. As an owner of an older rescue dog, this book has special meaning, but non-dog owners alike will enjoy this book. (By the way, my mother read this book in a weekend, then went and got herself a kindle.)
1439133948|5.0|It is so great to get a new book in this series.  Miles Vorkosigan is one of my favorite characters and this book continues his life as a father of four children and working far from home.  There are the usual problems and his almost effortless solving of them.<br /><br />This won't give you quite the same joy if you haven't read the series since all the characters are new to you and the history can't possibly all be given.  But it will give you a lovely taste of the Bujold Vorkosiganverse and almost certainly make you want to read the others.<br /><br />This series is space opera and the characters are the glue that holds everything together so nicely. The universe is very well developed and almost realistic and usual.  If you like a good story with great character development, try this.  It is suitable for men, women and teens.
B0043RGY60|5.0|This is such a great album and the deluxe is definitely something to invest in! I love everything about this version and highly recommend anyone to buy it. I love 30 Seconds to Mars, they are true entertaining artists that love their fans and appreciate them like no one else. Love to the Echelon for your part with the album and short films, love to Mr Cubbins for great work and much love to the band for loving us like we love you and your artwork!
1579126235|5.0|I bought this for a friend as part of a \\"killer\\" Xmas gift. You all know the plot because you have all (probably) seen the movie, and there is no point in me attempting to critique Agatha Christie's writing style.   It was a good price; delivery was prompt; I had no issues with any part of the transaction. 'Nuff said.
B00005KISG|1.0|The movie I received was for the wrong region so it will not play and I didn't get it in the mail soon enough to return it so I guess I am stuck with it.
0552149527|5.0|This book is hard to put down with so many twists and turns I never knew WHO was going to change sides next! Don't know WHY some of the other reviewers put this book down so much...I will say that in many ways it DOES resemble The DaVinci Code-except in a different setting...but I enjoyed having it set near my home town.
0765326353|4.0|The Way of Kings is a fast paced, entertaining read.  I suspect fans of Sanderson will enjoy his newest venture, but Im not sure those who dislike his previous books will find any significant changes.    Strengths: Sanderson prose is brisk and highly readable.  Though the book is over 1000 pages, the action flows realatively fast and the book doesnt feel drawn out.  There are plenty of action sequences, which Sanderson is adept at writing.  Similar to Mistborn, there are well explored themes involving leadership.  Seeing how people of different character, upbringing, and station react to realatively similar situations, Sanderson delves into what makes an effective leader.  The inside cover art and maps are some of the most outstanding I have seen in several hundred fantasy reads.  Some of the chapter cover art contains interesting hand written notes about biology or other aspects of the world, further adding depth to the world building.  The world building and system of \\"magic\\" is unique.      Weaknesses: Sanderson's brisk prose can also be a weakness.  There is no weilding of language ala Guy Gavriel Kay or China Mieville here.  Thats fine as long as you know what to expect.  Sandersons main female protagonist lacks the depth of character he displayed in Mistborn.  There are \\"interludes\\" where Sanderson will have several short chapters on characters that we have not met yet in the main story.  These interludes will often show three or more new characters.  In a novel running 1000 pages, perhaps these could have been editted down.  That being said, Im sure these interludes are not accidental and will play into the story in future books.  The question is how valuable or important is 4 pages on a character in this novel for future books?    My main worry is that I have heard this work to be projected as a decalogy.  That worries me, as I usually find epic fantasy to lose its focus when series go beyond trilogies.  I think we can feel confident Sanderson can finish a long series more rapidly than any other fantasy author currently writing.  Can he keep it focused and tight is the question.    Overall this was a fun read, with likeable protagonists and unique world building worth 4/5 for me.  Depending upon where the series goes, this number could easily move both up or down.
0385341008|5.0|We recently visited Guernsey, St Peter Port  and found it lovely and the people equally nice and friendly.  The book describes [even though fiction] the basic history of this island during and after the occupation of the German troops during WW II  It is very interesting in its letter form of telling the story.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|My son (7 yrs) and I loved it!  Yes, it's quirky...but brilliantly done.    It was engaging, and really a very complex interpersonal story between the characters. And just try not to repeat phrase 'what the cuss?' after watching it.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've been using the same style headphone for years since the SONY tape walkman...until I took on the Bose noise reduction \\"muffin\\" type for my traveling needs.  I bought these for my friend when she was complaining the iphone/ipod buds kept falling out when she was training for her marathon.  They were perfect and she said not once did she have a problem during her marathon run.  And she loved that it also served as a headband for all her falling bangs during the run, too! :O)
B00480O9L4|4.0|i really enjoyed this book must read others liked salamander she was clever and different. a good read right to last page.
145283668X|4.0|I'd been meaning to read this story for a long time!  This book is so famous and referenced and retold that it was very interesting to read the original 1886 prose!  The story is written as an account of events told by Dr. Jekyll's concerned lawyer friend.  It's very detailed and by the time you've finished hardly a stone has been unturned!  Being so accostomed to the idea that people may have different sides to their personality has somewhat conditioned my response to the story.  I do really enjoy thinking about the people who originally read the story when it was first published who must have gotten a thrill from the horror of science gone wrong!  The edition I recieved was simply the story with no other added info which was fine with me!
B001DJ7PN2|5.0|An emotional roller coaster. Armed with an outstanding cast, chilling music and intensifying filming angles, Oliver Stone has arguably created the finest film of his career. It was a brave attempt whose impact was so great that legislation was passed to disclose all assassination documents by late 2017. This film is not brilliant because it solves the Kennedy debate but because it examines all perspectives of the assassination, including the unlikely single shooter theory.       This film follows the true story of the District Attorney of New Orleans Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) who begins his own investigation into the assassination after finding several flaws and contradictions in the Warren Commission. This film follows that shocking and revelatory investigation.      Every American should experience JFK. The experience is shocking. As a proud American, I would prefer to accept the single shooter theory; but with solid research and a plethora of plausible alternatives presented, Oliver Stone forces me to accept that my government has the power to assassinate an American President. A single viewing of this epic is not enough. Not even after two, three or even four times did I absorb everything this film has to offer. It is to be watched multiple times and perhaps with a lots of reflection, viewers can draw their own conclusions.       Stone has been intensely criticized for making this epic. He has even been compared to Nazi film director, Leni Riefenstahl. The critic who made this comparison and who shall remain anonymous, says Stone hyperbolizes historic facts and adds his own creative spin to the story to incite rebellious behavior in American youth. To a certain extent, that's true. Oliver Stone does include fictitious characters and does rewrite history with a biased pen, but in doing so, he is throwing more evidence at viewers to further persuade them that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone on November 22, 1963.       I have spent countless hours contemplating the who and the how, but as the film states, \\"The who and the how are just scenery for the public...It keeps them from asking the most important question. Why? Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefitted? Who has the power to cover it up? Who?\\"      This should be mandatory viewing because regardless of personal beliefs, the assassination is history, monumental history.
0525951652|5.0|The book starts with 300 pages of awesome writing. The buildup of a boy heading to the coal mines for the first time and left alone in the dark is so well written that you feel you are there. The \\"Billy-with-Jesus\\" build up is matched with his sister's compassionate story as the housekeeper at a wealthy Earl's home. Also, the interplay with the Earl, his Russian Princess wife, and the housekeeper build a tapestry that makes you read the pages regardless of time (I went to sleep at 3:30am and could not wait to continue the next night).    Then things slow down and grand characters take over. The German aristocrat, Walter, consumes too much of the story without building any sympathies. His father if written as a caricature and his mother as something from a cartoon that is poking fun at Germans. The story bounces back and forth from Russian factories, New York gangsters, Presidents and soldiers without following anyone in particular. What is missing is a lead character (I would have picked 'Billy-with-Jesus'), but instead we are asked to follow 6-7 'lead' characters, which leads to nice history reading, but not a compelling story.    In the last 200 pages, big events takes over and the story about British soldiers in Russia is a side-show that could have been edited out. Instead we could have got more from Gregori and his new wife and child. The story could have focused less on central committees and grand people, and more on the small people of Russia (similar to what Follet did in the \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" book).    Despite these critical issues, the book is awesome and I really, really, look forward to the next one...
B000GH3CVQ|3.0|\\"Once\\" quickly became one of my favorite movies and soundtracks. I still listen to the CD often (almost every day since it's also my daughters' favorite CD as well), so I was excited to listen to the new effort by Hansard and Irglova. The new music was good, some very good, but there are only a total of ten songs, and three, so 30%, are from \\"Once\\" (though they are arranged/interpreted slightly differently). I got the impression that they didn't have enough songs to make a new album, so they beefed it up with old songs to justify charging for a new album. It pains me to say this since I'm huge fans of theirs, but I kind of felt cheated. I'd say I was gypped, but I received this CD as a gift, so I can't say I personally was gypped. Still, kind of a disappointment.<br /><br />Update: See Ms. Blake's response to my review. She is absolutely right that I was in a state of ignorance when I wrote my review. I wasn't aware that Swell Season had actually been released before Once. Thus, I see the error of my ways, thanks to Ms. Blake, and rescind the negative parts of my first review. My comments about the music, that it was good, even very good, still stand, and it's definitely an album worth listening to. I became aware after watching \\"Once\\" that Hansard had been around for a while, but I hadn't heard any of his music before \\"Once.\\" The total playing time of the album is still on the short side, but I no longer feel justified in feeling disappointed by the fact that three of the songs were from \\"Once,\\" since that's not accurate. So thanks, Ms. Blake (for the comments and the education, not for the condescension; you can keep that). I swallow my pride and throw myself on the mercy of the court.
0143034901|4.0|This book is most certainly a page turner. You never know what is hiding around the next corner. This novel is filled with sex, scandal, love, revenge, mystery, and more sex. With an ending that cannot be predicted, it is definitely a must read.
031603438X|5.0|Knock down the walls. Turn up the volume. Lean into those riffs.<br />Rock n' Roll certainly has its legends and colorful characters. Keith Richards is no exception.<br /><br />Trouble, strife and misfortune always were on the heels of this popular and charismatic entertainer.  He survived it all.<br /><br />From  childhood days of hanging out with Grandpa Gus, his first guitar, the teen years and hooking up with Mick, the birth of the Rolling Stones, skyrocketing into stardom, the turbulent sixties era and following decades, we read of all the going-ons behind the song compositions and albums. It's a total wonder that Keith is still alive after all the drug abuse and hard living of a super star.<br /><br />What did catch my attention was his obvious passion for the music itself.  He absolutely loves it! Talking chords, the 5-string guitar to get different sounds, composition of the songs themselves...it was and still is his life.<br /><br />The last thirty odd pages are heartfelt and seem to bond the entire five hundred fifty pages together.<br />And yes, the book is riddled throughout with the f-bomb. But what would one expect from the world of rock n' roll anyway? If you are looking for a saintly reminisce, you should probably look elsewhere.<br />Thanks Keith. Enjoyed it.
0312600844|1.0|I was excited to read this book, because I'd read so many good things about it. But it was tough to get through. It badly needed better editing - there are long sections of political rant (rant I happen to agree with, but even so...) The characters never broke out of their stereotypes, and in the end I realized I didn't care what happened to them. I experienced freedom when I had finally finished.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Pixar just cannot seem to make bad movies. With so many to chose from it now a matter of which one you like best over the other one. For me I think Toy Story 2 was the best in this series. With that said this movies has it all. It heart warming, funny, and just so smooth. The 3d animation is top notch. Great little toy addition to the already wild cast of characters. My favorite being Big Baby. I just love it when he says \\"mama\\" in that baby toy voice as he does the security work of an adult. The positive is already there so their not much I can say that other haven't. The blu-ray is supper clean, very beautiful, and the sound is amazing. It obvious a 3d version is going to be out later, but seeing as I have not made the jump to 3d yet. This is the perfect copy for me.

B003NFM3JU|3.0|This movie is a good take on the same old tale we all come to love. I just didn't expect it to be a little on the scary side. Literally some scene in the movie had made me more tense than some of the horror genre itself. I came in thinking this could be a good movie for the kids on a nice cold holiday season, I came out thinking I better not let them watch it just yet. Other than that the movie itself is decent. The 3d animation seem off just like any movie that uses this photo 3d animation style. But it a good movie to own when the price is right, but I wouldn't get my hope up on it since it is Disney. This version does offer a lot though for the price.
0385341008|5.0|I love to read letters (a lost art now) and this book is written through letters to and about the various characters. By the title, you would never think that this is a WWII story. It is sad, happy, courageous, and also a love story. It was also informative because I had never known that the Channel Islands were occupied by Germany. The story shows the terrible price the people on these islands paid, but also the humanity of some of the German soldiers and how war affects society.<br /><br />It was a quick read and I would definitely recommend it.
1593272200|5.0|This book is amazing! It is so much more thorough and comprehensive than any other Linux book that I have read through in the past. I have to be honest to say that I have never considered myself to be an expert in Linux programming, but I have dabbled in it in the past. This book however has set the bar so high because it truly walks you through pretty much any issue that I can think of in regards to programming in Linux.  With 64 chapters which cover a myriad of different topics and uses 200 example programs, 88 tables, 115 diagrams and 1506 pages, you will be as amazed as I was to the treasure that this book is.<br /><br />One of the things that I appreciated in the chapters were the exercises that they have you work on as you are going through the book. Though some chapters only have one exercise, you still get challenged by the author to utilize the knowledge that he is imparting in the chapter.<br /><br />The book itself claims to be a 'new classic' and though this seems a bit pretentious, I would have to agree with them. I have to agree and say that you will not find another as comprehensive resource on the market today!<br /><br />Overall this is an amazing read and I highly recommend it to all Linux programmers (or wanna-be's).
B003NFM3JK|4.0|Robert Zemeckis continues with determination on the path of motion capture 3d animation, and 'A Christmas Carol' is his most successful result so far. However, I think this has more to do with the beautiful, consistent design of the film and the familiarity of Dickens's timeless ghost story than with any marked advances in the animation of virtual humans that could pass for real. The fact that the Scrooge character works quite well is due to its cartoonish look, with enormous protruding chin and nose. Other characters are firmly stuck in what the industry sometimes refers to as 'uncanny valley', that area where virtual humans are not unrealistic enough to make our imagination fill in the blanks, but are afflicted with subtle unrealities that make them look like really weird, strangely repulsive real people. Mouths and eyes in particular remain problematic. The digital versions of Colin Firth (Cousin Fred) and Gary Oldman (Bob Cratchit) that we encounter are rather startling.<br /><br />As an adaptation of Dickens's story for the screen, none has yet been more faithful to the original. Not only is Zemeckis textually true, but he captures the eerie atmosphere of Dickens to perfection. This is therefore a very dark, at times scary Christmas Carol, definitely not suitable for young children, I would say. On the other hand the director has allowed a few flights of fancy. The appearance of the Ghost of Christmas Past as a living candle I found quite brilliant, and the dance floor antics of Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig are bound to draw a few laughs. Other additions are less succesfull and some, such as the overdone chase of Scrooge by the Phantom Hearse, are at odds with the atmosphere of the story and apparently only there to spice up the 3d version of the film.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is less of a problem than I had feared, and though he voiced the ghosts as well, I didn't even recognize him there. The continuous, joyless fake laughter of the Ghost of Christmas Present I did find pretty annoying, though.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to the fast pacing of the story (and time taken up by unnecessary additions, such as that chase scene I mentioned) I did feel that Scrooge's character change comes about rather abruptly, without allowing enough time for a believable thawing of his cold heart. And at the end a general sense of unpleasantness remained that I find hard to pinpoint and may have something to do with that 'uncanny valley', combined with the abundance of dark and  morbid imagery. Nonetheless, an intruguing excercise in gothic spookiness; and as a feast for the eyes this is quite recommendable; you won't ever see a more Christmassy London than you get here here.g, though.

B000001ESJ|5.0|Rush is one of those bands you either love or love to hate. Personally I fall into the former category. A Farewell to Kings was the first Rush album,well 8-track, that I purchased way back at the tender age of 15. The lyrics, the music, the percussion... It all spoke to me then and continues to resonate 35 years later. If you are a Rush fan, you'll love this album. If you aren't a Rush fan, too bad; that's your loss!

B0043X7WLA|5.0|With all praise justly given to Illinoise, I can only imagine how hard it was to decide how to follow up that wonderful album.   The Age of Adz all but threw out what made Illinoise such a great success.  Gone of the short and highly composed songs that filled that album.  Now we're treated to \\"songs\\" of greater length and diversity.  Fans of Michigan and Illinoise may be disappointed by this album at first, but give it a chance.  I think it's every bit as good as his previous efforts, and the accomplishment of The Age of Adz shows that Sufjan Stevens may well be the leading voice in independent music today.
142311339X|5.0|Just as good as the Percy Jackson series. The shift from one main character/first person to three main characters/third person was very interesting. It was nice to see the different sides to the characters of the gods, and (SPOILER ALERT) I was glad to see a child of Hephestus. There were a large number of typos, but that is a small issue.  My biggest issue is the number of awkward sentences.  The book was obviously published in a hurry.
1416572287|5.0|\\"he called it spukhafte Fernwirkung  \\"Spooky action at a distance?\\" she translates  \\"Since when do you know German?\\"  \\"Dude, look at me\\" she turns sideways for a second, showing off her black and tan coloring and pointed nose.  \\"German shepherd, remember?\\"     So goes the banter between a dog and his owner as they discuss the strange world of quantum physics.  This highly readable book will take you into the realms of quantum tunneling, Schrodinger's Wave equations, the quantum zeno effect and other topics of this strange world of the very small.    Chad Orzel writes a very clear, readable book using his dog Emmy to explain the physics of quantum mechanics. The style which he uses his conversations with his dog to set up the explanations is an ingenious method and for those who are not familiar with the subject provides a short glossary; for those who want to read more suggested readings are also given.       What I liked about this book is how Mr. Orzel takes on the tasks of dispelling certain myths about quantum physics in a very nonthreatening manner. Usually it is his dog who has the incorrect interpretation of the concept and upon examples and strong analogies, the concept is explained and by the end of the chapter Emmy understands.      For example, Emmy begins chapter 2 with a lost bone and failure to understand Chad's joke about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.  After Emmy finds her bone (under the TV) Chad begins to explain the principle and at the end of the chapter Emmy comes back to help us summarize what we learned.      The use of Emmy is a clever way to introduce the \\"What does that mean?\\" into a book that could be a dry and dusty tome about a subject that many would probably never read about.  The use of Emmy is not over done nor is it condescending towards the reader.  You are taken along with Emmy into Orzel's explanations with no abrupt jumps in transition.     Overall the book is a joy to read, but unfortunately there are parts where you mayhave to just back up and read again.  Quantum physics is a hard topic to explain to those who are not familiar with the topic and while Orzel does a very good job at explanations, sometimes the reader will have to re-read a passage to grasp what he is saying.  This is not the fault of the author, it is the fault of the subject.  The world of these tiny objects is quite beyond what we can perceive so we have to be very imaginative to explore this world.  Because of this, written explanations can get wordy or burdensome trying to illustrate these difficult concepts.  Orzel does a good job of clearing the air and helping the reader understand.      As a teacher of high school physics, I have read many books on quantum physics and this one, I must say, tops the list in readability, interest and clarity.  I even would venture to use it as a text in a high school class to introduce the topic of quantum physics.      While it helps to have a background knowledge of physics when reading this book, any one can learn from this book and enjoy it.  As the college syllabus  reads \\"Prerequisites-none\\".

B004132I4S|5.0|Wow, I just can't describe how much I love this album.  But I'll try. This is like a perfect blend of the Sufjan we have come to love (you can hear some self-referencing hooks), but with an awesome twist that reminds me of so many different cool influences: Of Montreal, Beulah, Olivia Tremor Control, Thom Yorke/Radiohead (how much does he sound like Thom Yorke at ~3:45 into I Want To Be Well!?)... It has a sort of a Flaming Lips thing going too with all the blips and bleeps and the general epic-ness.  I wouldn't even consider it a \\"grower\\" since I was totally hooked at first listen, and I have been listening to it on loop since getting it. I guess it could be a grower, since I feel slightly more obsessive weeks later. Either way, I guess that is all a matter of what you want from your music.  This album is absolutely worth your attention if you are open minded to an artist evolving/trying new things!
B003VQM2M4|3.0|For me this second release by Grinderman isn't as exciting or as worthy as their exceptional first album. I loved Grinderman 1, loved the fast hard dirty rock of it, the hilarious lyrics of these old rockers taking the mickey out of themselves. But with this second album I'm left wanting more. For me its a largely incoherent collection of songs rather than an album. The best song, Palaces of Montezuma sounds like a typical ballad from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, not the dirty aging rockers of Grinderman. Final nail in the coffin is the rubbish drawings and scribblings in the booklet in the deluxe edition.

B003UESJFG|5.0|After some waivering, I decided to see Megamind 3D.  I'm a big fan of 3D, and the 3D is done very well.  There is no reason to see the 2d version when the 3D is available.<br /><br />As I said the movie is funny, but not by telling jokes. It's funny in a real way, generally done via sarcasm, goofy grammar usage, and self-deprecation.  The plot is a nice change from the typical hero/villain plot, and will keep you interested!<br /><br />The biggest thing that not many people are mentioning is how brilliantly done the animation is.  The images, and scenery are so crisp and vivid, it really is mind blowing.  Paired with the 3D effects, this is a visually stunning movie.<br /><br />I regret waivering on this movie. I almost didn't even bother with it.  I'm glad I listened to the good reviews, and took the plunge. It was worth every penny, and every minute spent.<br /><br />Dreamworks is on a roll.
B000EGDAI4|5.0|I've just checked out Rollins' bio on the frequently consulted \\"All Music Guide\\" (AMG), which in the very first sentence bluntly praises him as the greatest if all modern saxophonists.  Granted, Sonny belongs in that special group of seminal giants--Hawk, Ben, and Prez and then come Stan, Stitt, Rollins, and a fellow by the name of Coltrane.  Moreover, attentive listeners will discover equally impressive, gifted, expressive tenor players if they listen carefully to scandalously neglected musicians like Harold Land and Hank Mobley.<br /><br />But age, apparently, has its privileges, and Sonny has been making records for 62 years, which in itself deserves some kind of special mention (though so has James Moody, and certainly Jimmy Heath isn't far behind).  Moreover, \\"Colossus,\\" which Amazon currently lists as its best-selling Rollins' date, was recorded in 1956, rather early for a player venerated for his \\"seminal\\" influence on the music.<br /><br />Sonny's sound, at least to my ears, changed dramatically around 1970.  Apparently a number of listeners prefer his earlier, darker, deeper, more muscular sound--at least based on the durability of his most revered sessions--most of them from the '50s.  \\"Newk's Time,\\" \\"Way Out West,\\" \\"Freedom Now Suite,\\" \\"Vol. 2,\\" \\"Tenor Madness,\\" \\"The Bridge\\"--these are the early Rollin' sessions that stand out, more so than the later ones, which featured a tenor sound that was more treblish, penetrating, rough and ragged (Sonny deserves credit for keeping his chops in shape, far more than other tenor greats).<br /><br />\\"Saxophone Colossus\\" may be the ideal place to start, a second stop might be \\"Tenor Madness\\" (the sound of Coltrane should expain, in part, Rollins' decision to take a 3-year sabbatical from the music), and then it may be time for some of the numerous trio recordings (which require a more devoted student of the tenor, someone not requiring the moderating sound of a piano).<br /><br />\\"St. Thomas\\" remains Rollins' best-known composition, and \\"Blue 7\\" one of the best examples of his \\"motivic\\" approach to improvisation.  And it should not go unnoticed that the pianist on \\"Colossus\\"--Tommy Flanagan--was also the pianist on Coltrane's arguably most influential recording: \\"Giant Steps.\\"  Finally, Sonny (or few other musicians) never had a better bass player than Doug Watkins.  Put all this together, and the result is an indispensable album.<br /><br />[Compare the tempo at the conclusion of \\"St. Thomas\\" to the tempo at the beginning.

B002ZG99TA|4.0|Normally, I can barely tolerate Tony Scott's frantic, even frenzied, directing style.  He's all about fast cuts, swooping angles and cursory character development.  He's often a bit like Michael Bay, with at least with a better visual sense.  His films often indicate changes in time or mood through a change in color saturation.  You CANNOT see one of his films and not constantly be reminded that you're watching a movie.  Films like MAN ON FIRE and TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 give me a headache.    UNSTOPPABLE is a film that finally has Scott back on track (pun intended).  His directing style hasn't changed...heck, it even stars his constant collaborator Denzel Washington.  But the story matches his style.  A runaway train, however scary such a thing might be, can pretty much only go straight and predictably...but Scott's over-baked sound mix, crazy editing and challenging camera angles make this hurtling train feel like a living monster.    The story is set in Pennsylvania.  At one end of the state, a bunch of useless railyard workers, through a series of bad choices, send a train pulling a large load of toxic chemicals on its way with the throttle down and no one on board.  Coming in the other direction are various obstacles...and another freight train carrying experienced railman Denzel and rookie conductor Chris Pine (from the recent STAR TREK).  Eventually, these two guys find themselves needing make some difficult choices in order to try to stop this crazy train from killing thousands of people.  That's really about all the film is about...yet it is very gripping.    We learn (or feel like we're learning) a lot about the workings of trains and rail systems.  Rosario Dawson, in a thankless role, is the person in the control booth with all the lights and microphones and computers around her (you know, sort of like the room Washington sat in for most of TAKING OF PELHAM...).  Her job is to spout statistics and physics, and to get into ridiculous yelling matches with the corporate suits, who can't make a single reasonable decision.  It's one thing to try to cast scorn on corporate types...it's another to make them behave about as brightly as a teenager in a slasher movie.    But the movie rests very comfortably on the shoulders of Washington and Pine.  Washington is in coasting mode, relying primarily on his still considerable charisma.  But he's smart and funny, and is simply a professional doing a great job of playing another professional in another profession.  But best of all is Pine.  I liked him a lot in STAR TREK (as Captain Kirk), but I worried that he was getting by on good looks and a smart mouth, coupled with a spectacle of a movie.  But here, he's still \\"hunky\\", but he feels blue collar and convincing.  When called upon to act bravely, he doesn't come off as a hero, but as a guy making tough choices in order to protect loved ones.  The two men have good chemistry...there's a little bit of the \\"old timer giving the new kid a hard time\\" banter...but less than I would have expected.  I wouldn't say their scenes are particularly well-written; they simply do a nice job with what they've got.    Meanwhile, the two trains hurtle, helicopters fly, mishaps and crashes occur all leading up to a remarkably tense and exciting final 15 minutes.  UNSTOPPABLE is not a classic action film...but it is a very worthy effort and it made for an excellent evening at the movies.  I also liked that it is a comfortable PG-13...there was plenty of noise and crashing, but no gratuitous death and gore.  It was a good blue collar film about some great blue collar guys.

B00479SVBU|4.0|I bought this mainly for the ability to navigate through folders that contained full albums of music from a usb flash drive. The unit is small, plugs directly into a cigarette lighter, comes with a handy little remote and has a lot more functions than you would expect from an item this reasonably priced. The previous review from A. Preston sums up a lot of the features and was very helpful to me when I was shopping. (thanks A!). Here's what I have to add.    There's not a lot of information available about how many folders or songs the player can read or how they read them, so I thought I would add that information for future shoppers.     The unit can access up to 99 folders and up to 1999 mp3's. You don't need to have a master folder as in some of the other models from this company. You can have folders inside folders up to a depth of 5, however the unit is only going to show you the names of the folders and their assigned folder number (as opposed to a directory tree like you would see on a computer). The player will see up to 32 gb of either usb flash drive OR SD card memory at one time. The display can show up to 32 characters(scrolling) for song name, 16 characters for artist name and 15 characters for album name in now playing screen.     Since my main goal was to play complete albums, my math is based on averages of my albums...you'll need to figure the true maximum amount of music you can store based on your preferences in bitrate. I was able to fit 99 albums on one 10gb flash drive and 99 albums on a 10gb SD card, giving me 198 albums to choose from without removing anything from the system. Remember, you're limited to 99 folders TOTAL, not 99 x 5 depth. :))    The only con I can think of for this is the fm transmitter portion of it. I'd highly recommend plugging it into an aux input or if you have a cassette player, a cassette adapter works nicely. When using the FM transmitter, the signal strength varies quite a bit and you wind up getting a lot of hiss from the radio. AUX works great though.    Lastly and definitely not least would be the customer service. I had several questions before I purchased and was answered each time within 24 hours with a personal reply...not some canned FAQ response.     Thanks for your help, Arthur!    I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.
159308322X|5.0|The Moonstone is a classic, and although is a great mystery, the writing is most creative.  The story is told as though one of the characters decided to write about the events over the past year. To help him, he asks other characters to take up a chapter from their own point of view. Therefore the story is \\"written\\" by several authors - all characters in the story. Because of the various writers, the style of writing changes to reflect the characters' personalities. This is a very creative method of defining each character and gives a better perspective of the events of the mystery.

I feel like this was a good book, old characters are revisited, but the focus remains on the new characters. Well-written, though in a different style alternating chapters between the three main characters' points of view. If you liked Riordan's other books, you will be sure to enjoy this one.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|genre. A stellar cast of, shall we say, senior citizens? Led by Bruce Willis playing, Frank Moses, a wry, Retired Extremely Dangerous agent who still has his skill set. The CIA is trying to kill him, collegue, Morgan Freeman & others for some unpleasantness that occurred in Central America years ago. So they set out to find out who & why. Early on Frank acquires a younger girl friend played by Mary Louise Parker. She is unwilling at first but they are trying to kill her too so she becomes an enthusiastic participant. The trail led to the vice president who turns out to be a master-mind criminal. So it is decided to kill him & prevent him from becoming president. They enlist killer John Malkevich & retired assassin for hire Helen Mirren. I've never seen such a sexy senior citizen manning a machine gun. She's the #1 reason I went to see this movie. They all ourageously ham it up but they are so good the plot hardly matters. Massive mayhem ensues as the bodies pile up. The violence is a bit cartoonish & this will never be mistaken for art.       It is really escapist fare, highly entertaining & you get your money's worth as it runs 111 miutes, long for this type movie. I lost myself monentarily while watching it. It won't be long after it's run that it will be on dvd /blueray. Excellent.
0316098337|1.0|Sorry, don't know why so many people like this book, maybe they are like the people calling Ma a \\"Saint.\\"<br /><br />The story itself is nothing original, reads pretty much (sadly) ripped out of the evening news. The \\"twist\\" on this version is that it is told from the point of view of 5 year old Jack. Horribly told. I got a headache deciphering Jack's language, the poor grammar just made a boring story a miserable read. I don't understand, his mother knew and spoke English well, why/how did Jack speak so poorly? Would he have not reflected his mother's language? And considering all the TV he watched you'd think he'd still speak better than he did. The poor language was the only device the author could come up with to make this book stand out from similar volumes.<br /><br />People say we see Jack grow and develop and his reactions to the outside world. We really didn't see much of that. He goes to the mall, he goes to the ocean, he goes to grandma's house. He's a scared little boy who wants to go back to Room. Where is Jack in 10 years? 20? The author could have easily added a chapter \\"Ten years later...\\" and showed us how Jack _did_ grow in \\"outside\\" instead of dropping the ball. His mother, we didn't see much of her after they escaped.<br /><br />And what was with the fixation on breast-feeding? We got the hint early on, she let him breast feed at 5. Did she have to tell us every 5 pages that he wanted another drink? Very repetitive, very boring, and kind of gross.<br /><br />If you're looking for an interesting read, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.<br /><br />Originality: 1 out of 5 (let's face it, this isn't anything new)<br />Character development: 2 out of 5 (Jack saw the outside world)<br />Capturing interest: 1 out of 5 (The annoying bad grammar kept me from getting immersed in the book)<br /><br />Someone will probably take this and make a worse movie out of a bad book, one I don't intend on watching.
0307266303|5.0|I've been road running for a couple of years now and have had bouts with various running related injuries.  I had read up on barefooting and minimalism before buying this book but had yet to make the jump.  After only a couple chapters of Born to Run I bought minimalist shoes from a local running store, and hit the trails near my house.  It's so much more fun.  I'm not ready to go barefoot yet, but if you believe in evolution (and science), it only makes sense.  We were biologically engineered to run without shoes!    Caballo Blanco recently gave a talk in my town so it was cool to hear the author's perspective on him as they met and became friends.  If you're not into running, I could see parts of this book being a bit slow, but it's an absolute must read for any runner.
0060775858|5.0|Goodnight Moon was the last book I read to my daughter every night before turning out her light.  I added a photo of her to the blank page at the end of the book, so she was the last to receive the goodnight message.  This continued for a long time, and to this day, I can recite much of this beautiful book by heart.  Now my daughter is an adult, and I have given the book to her friends who are new parents. If you are looking for a gift that will be treasured by everyone in the family I highly recommend Goodnight Moon.  I wish Margaret Wise Brown could see how many people of all ages love her incredibly sweet, touching book.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I first become a fan of Daria in 1998-99 when it first started airing on the ABC in Australia. I still have VHS tapes with the original soundtrack. Finally this series was put on dvd after so many years, almost gave up waiting!     I thoroughly enjoyed the series - it brings back a lot of memories. I echo the sentiments from other reviewers on amazon saying that the lack of soundtrack is disappointing - it is - but there are only a few episodes where I actually do remember the music on them. The studio music they replaced with is pretty awful - but they tried. A couple of old soundtrack songs actually made it onto the closing credits - by error or permission?    The DVD really needs an episode guide, whether it is just a running list, or a description of the episode as well. The letter from the producers about why there was no music is irrelevant after you read it - a list would be so useful for continued viewing!    The scripting is still brilliant. The oddities of Jake and the torment his childhood presents him can be so much more appreciated when you're older watching it! Helen's inherent understanding of her daughter brings it back home that its often the people we push most away understand us the best, Quinn, her relationship with Daria and her brainless friends with oddly redeeming qualities throw interesting curve balls into the series. I especially appreciate Mr Di Martino in the series, his reference to calling the union about extracurricular class allocation and leading staff on strike as part of the \\"Lawndale High Teachers Union\\" made me laugh - I work as a union official!     I'd rather not anaylise everything - it makes watching the series like an assignment! But thoroughly recommend it, especially for those of us who are nerds at heart!
1594488843|5.0|Granted, I am a Daniel Pink fan - and even if I weren't, this book would take up residence in my library. Understanding ourselves is a life-long adventure.  It is a struggle, at times, and this a book like this comes along and provides a vocabulary and perspective that paves the way to insight, understanding and knowledge.<br /><br />Susan Bock<br />Consultant and Coach for Business Women<br />[...]
0446672653|4.0|Most of us folks in India grow up believing in reincarnation. It is kind of taken for granted. But even then, this book was a very interesting read for me. It presents this in a honest and simple way that touches you.<br /><br />It is a great read for anyone dreaming of finding and uniting with his/ her soulmate.
1594481717|5.0|Some days that would be nice, other days I rather like what I have!  That being said, being such a Daniel Pink fan, I had to read this and am I ever glad I did.<br />He has a way of introducing new ideas in a way that makes it easy to understand and integrate into my thinking.  Whether you are a right-brain or left-brain thinker, you will benefit from reading this book.  It's another winner from Mr. Pink and I like the way he thinks!<br /><br />Susan Bock<br />Consultant and Coach for Business Women<br />[...]
0156027321|4.0|A unique and original novel. By far the best (and longest) part is about Pi being lost at sea with the animals. The first section dealing with his upbringing in India I found somewhat naïve in its' religious depictions. Pi assimilates Hinduism, Islam and Christianity - this in a subcontinent where millions have died in religious wars.<br /><br />However the `maroon on the boat' portion is convincing, poignant and at times funny. The symbiosis between Pi and the tiger does become belaboured after 150 pages.<br /><br />Apparently Margaret Atwood put this book at the same level as Moby Dick - which begs the question as to whether she has ever read anything of Melville. Actually `Life of Pi' is a story of survival. It reminded me of `The Mysterious Island' by Jules Verne - more so after Pi lands on his own mysterious island. Also what's this opening presumptious blurb of believing in God after completing the book - didn't do it for me!
0340822775|5.0|David Mitchell has written himself into a class of authors may aspire to, but few achieve.     His ability to write from such radically different perspectives and voice while still assembling a remarkably coherent story over hundreds of years is pretty remarkable. Hard to envision how he even came to the idea of creating this story.    Recommended.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|Excellent Album, it includes two CDs, the first one is the new release, and the second one is the original Double Fantasy album as it appeared in 1980. Both CDs contains the same tracks, but those on CD1 have a purest and fresh sound, since are new mixes from the rehearsals of 1980 sessions. I'm sure you will enjoy rediscovering John & Yoko's Double Fantasy album by listening these 2010 mixes.
B00406UK7S|1.0|Everything in this film is unbelievably predictable, stale, by-the-numbers, and obvious.  You know right away that the minorities will die first; the Numidian (black guy), the Assyrian (arab guy), the Greek (arab-looking guy), etcetera.  There's the standard archetypes, as opposed to characters; the grizzled old soldier, the straight sidekick, the noble superhuman leader who just knows everything on how to survive, including fluent Gaelic, even the token fist-fight with weapon just out of reach and bad guy and good guy racing to get the weapon in time.<br /><br />I don't particularly mind the use of British accents, not just standard British, but the \\"lower\\" class type, Cockney, Liverpudilan, Scottish, Irish, etcetera to represent a wide variety of accents that such a mixed Roman Imperial army would have, but it becomes highly disorienting and rips you out of the immersion when they don't just speak with the accents, but use heavily British mannerisms in their speech.<br /><br />There's virtually little to the characters to make them in any way compelling or likeable.  In particular, the General is said to be so great, like a father, brother, and even god to his men, yet this is never displayed.  It's what TVTropes calls an \\"Implied Attribute\\", when a character is said to be in a certain way, yet it's never displayed on screen.<br /><br />The sole token battle scene inspired promise initially, as they show a very well-executed display of Roman discipline, as they quickly got into Schiltron formation, making circles with their shields and spears pointed outward, but once the battle actually unfolded, it devolved to generic Hollywood 'one-man-army' type fighting, with the shields suddenly gone and the swords being used to block axes, and loads of gratuitous gore that at the very least isn't pointless, but is used to such excess that you start to easily spot CG gore, particularly when the blood is just TOO solid in tone---with no variations in color tone based on lighting or shadow.<br /><br />The rest of the story is just the band of archetypes on the run from Etain, a Brigante who betrays the Romans in such a clear and obvious way, who hunts them viciously until a fight where just three of them survive.<br /><br />There's even a token romantic subplot which is not only painfully devoid of chemistry, but completely and utterly pointless, without any relevance to the plot, likely just to inflate the run-time by 10 or 15 minutes (the movie is only 1 hour and 30 minutes).<br /><br />There's not much of interest in this movie.  It's typical in being problematic with historical accuracy, has some action, but hardly anything remarkable or not seen in other movies, and done better.<br /><br />It's the sort of film you'd watch on TV once, maybe while doing something else.The rest of the story is just the band of archetypes on the run from Etain, a Brigante who betrays the Romans in such a clear and obvious way, who hunts them viciously until a fight where just three of them survive.

1742014941|5.0|I don't need to add what the story is about because there are hundred of reviews repeating  it. I t's my favorite book along with The Help. I did not read it..I did the audio book version and  the narrator did an awesome job.
1589795474|2.0|The gist of this book is that you should spend less than you earn. If this is a lesson you need to learn, then you should read this book.    However, the idea that this book may help you on the pathway to riches, probably not. It is a compilation of statistics on existing millionaires, but it does not mean that trying to fit their mold will lead you to becoming a millionaire.    Most people would like the freedom provided by wealth. The prototypical millionaire from the book does not seem to reap many of the benefits from their wealth. They live like normal middle class Americans. They work hard. They are tightwads and proud of it. If that is your goal, then this is the book for you.    For a dramatically different strategy I would consider The 4-Hour Workweek, by Timothy Ferriss. Work less, enjoy life more. Don't worry about becoming a millionaire.
0385737424|5.0|Miranda receives anonymous letters telling her things that will happen in the future. For some reason her best friend decides not to be friends with her. Miranda makes new friends but is asked in the notes not to share them with anyone. She reads A WRINKLE IN TIME over and over again and begins discussing time travel with come classmates. She is also helping her mom practice to be on a game show. If you loved A WRINKLE IN TIME you will enjoy this book. If you are interested in time travel you will enjoy this book. If you want to know what it's like to grow up in New York City you will enjoy this book.  I read it when it first came out and reread it when it won the Newbery Medal.  Enjoyed it even more the second time.
0061537969|3.0|I found Garth Stein's book to be well written but extremely depressing. I put it down a number of times, and three-quarters of the way through, decided not to finish it. Based on other reviews and my love of dogs, I was hoping for an entertaining albeit emotional and uplifting read. Instead, I felt a sadness and helplessness for each character, including Enzo, the dog. Cancer, death, a child custody battle...there was little joy in this book. If you're into race car driving, the analogies of driving skills to life might speak to you.
0545123275|5.0|Maggie Stiefvater has written a book about a girl who falls in love with a wolf. Even before Grace knew Sam was a werewolf, she would watch the yellow eyed wolf in the woods behind her house in Minnesota and he seemed to be watching her. After being shot by a hunter, Sam takes his human shape and Grace recognizes his eyes, saves his life and they fall in love. As winter settles in Sam will once again become wolf. Some teens who have been bitten believe there is a cure. Is there? This book will appeal to fans of Twilight and is definitely a YA book for mature readers.
B003DZX44I|5.0|The movie is great Disney quality. It's yet another classic, and the blu-ray picture and sound quality are impeccable. Price is a little steep, but on the other hand this is one of the movies that is going to be watched over and over again with the kids. Highly recommended!
0385737947|4.0|Thomas wakes up in the Glade with no memory of where he came from, why he's there, who he is except his name.  There are about 60 other boys and they farm, cook, and run the mazes surrounding them trying to find a way out.  Grievers, mechanical monsters attack anyone still in the maze after the doors close at night.  When a girl, Teresa arrives things start to change.  Can they find a way out and survive?  This is dystopian literature and will appeal to those who enjoyed THE GIVER, CITY OF EMBER, and THE HUNGER GAMES.  Spoiler--it is violent and the first in a trilogy.
1439177783|5.0|The book was amazing. I finished it in a day. I couldn't put it down. Although hard to read at times as I, myself, am in recovery, but the blatant honesty was admirable. The ending where she describes the time between realizing she had an eating disorder to where she is now was so moving it brought me to tears. I, too, hope to have an extremely happy ending to my story as well.
