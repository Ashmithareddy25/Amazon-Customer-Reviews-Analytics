0307266303|5.0|I read a lot of books about all kinds of subjects.  This book was fantastic.  I immediately took a liking to the author, who's obviously just a very nice person.  I hope all his success hasn't changed that.  Stay real Chris!<br /><br />The book made me want to run, a lot.  I got the Vibrams 5 fingers he references, changed my running style, went all in.  I totally recommend this book.<br /><br />PS I don't recommend the Vibrams product because they caused an injury.  Buy running flats instead.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|Chip and Dan are gifted writers and do an excellent job in crafting practical tools to create sticky ideas.  I was immediately able to apply them in my work.  My first presentation using some of their techniques was a hit, it surprised me.  I was always skeptical about telling stories, but when I started a key meeting with a story, what a difference it made in getting everyone engaged.<br /><br />On this mother's day weekend, I thank Mrs Heath for making sure Chip and Dan learned the fine art of teaching and making it stick.<br /><br />Wick
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Part too complete and all I can do is get ready for part three.  Unexpected twists leave you salivating to know what really happened.  What a great series!  I highly recommend them.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I could relate to the story and made me laugh. Its Corny, but sometimes that is what you want. I watched three times already.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|It was a very good movie.  I would watch it again if necessary.  I would love to share with my hubby because he would like it too!
0226264211|4.0|This book is a cursory overview of capitalism and its ideology and is written to get you interested in the political underpinnings of the modern libertarian movement. Great read.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I found Reich's novel to be interesting. As I live in the  Northwest, it was interesting to read about prehistoric times in this area. Her books always keep my attention.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like this game. I play it often. I seem to run out of lives too soon, but it is still fun.

B00BR0SEAK|5.0|The choice of getting Bob Ezrin to produce the new Deep Purple album was a real masterstroke. To those people who can't be bothered with a \\"modern\\" Deep Purple album, should simply take a chance and listen to this album a few times. It's as memorable as Deep Purple have ever been. There's no point in comparing this new album to their past classics. Those albums are timeless, but that does not detract from the overall excellence of \\"NOW What?!\\" An album which doesn't patronize the listener or show the band resting on their laurels. This is an exciting and heavy rock album that's relevant and fresh, without rehashing any elements from their past anthems. It's a work Deep Purple should be justifiably proud. Money well spent.

B0084B1T8Y|5.0|This is a magical collection of stories by Rudyard Kipling. It is one of the greatest children's books ever written. It is not poetry in the sense that its lines scan, but its imagery is poetic and its plot has allegorical features. It contains some of the finest literary adventures to come to us from the British colonial period. Set in a jungle in India, it is an hypnotic tale that reflects some Victorian values kindred to those found in Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan novels, although in The Jungle Book all such values had to have been carefully screened as they passed through the wise and circumspect Kipling filter. Somehow they do not seem entirely strange and alien today, although they may bear traces of the British writer's experience of regimental life in India and his many travels  elsewhere. The author, a friend both of Theodore Roosevelt and American history and lore, was conscious of the drift by rival European powers and the surges of continental militarism. Somehow, perhaps, he allows his values to be colored by this awareness, yet he does not miss a single beat in relating the jungle adventure. The book is unique; no writer other than Kipling could have created it. It tells the story of Mowgli, a boy raised by wolves and the other beasts of the jungle. The behavior of the wolves that accept the boy in their family is as convincing as is the story of the great apes that accept Tarzan in theirs. Kipling is revealing more than that of which he speaks. Mowgli's adventure is a wondrous story, also about the life of every youngster with imagination and the force that is the will to be within him. The author is talking to readers about how to cope with tough problems, and he acknowledges even the hidden dangers that appear from time to time while growing up. He talks about fear and courage, predator and prey. He talks about the struggle to live and to understand. He hints at the problems of being an Englishman in India. But Mowgli is a jungle boy. Sometimes, although Kipling does not say he is, he may be talking about colonial activities. He never says that he sometimes thinks of a colonialist in an occupied country. That is not the story he narrates; he tells, instead, of the threats posed by great carnivores that hunt and kill, such as the tiger, Mowgli's greatest enemy; the panther is there, and of course the wolf, the snake, birds and all the animals of the jungle. As a wolf-boy, Mowgli may not be a direct symbol for colonial power, but several famous historical power-figures were said to have been raised by wolves, including Cyrus, the founder of the ancient Persian empire (who was father of Cambyses, father of Cyrus the Great); there were others, too, such as the traditionally celebrated founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus, who were believed to have been raised by wolves. Mowgli meets the challenges of the jungle's awful threats without the dangerous false pride some humans are believed to feel. The dreadful beasts that are the boy's enemies and the kindly ones who are his friends all communicate in a human language, and some of them have eccentricities that make them much too human (at least for some who apply special critical standards, of course, but the game being played in this is intended to produce an understandable if fictional account of a life that is in a dangerous and frightening process of developing). Mowgli adjusts to his world in a way that must be the equivalent of growing up and becoming civilized for people who have never been to the jungle. Mowgli survives and grows amid strange and dangerous beings and wild adventure. The plot and Mowgli's passage through terrifying events of jungle existence can be interpreted as somehow akin to what every child experiences while acculturating within mysterious and apparently dangerous surroundings. Most of us read the stories in this book as very satisfying adventures, but some more imaginative readers may view the Mowgli adventure as a tale of survival that each child faces in the process of gaining footing in a huge, dangerous world. Every child must learn to adjust to the society around him, and in Mowgli's case, that society is described as consisting of violent predators and prey animals. Like another character that thrives in some of these stories -- the mongoose Rikki-tikki-tavi -- Mowgli faces and overcomes enormous challenges. The depth of character, involving resilience and awareness, is what defines  Mowgli; it grows with each moment of his adventure. This truly is one of the greatest of all children's books.

B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Dear John was an amazing book and it tells a story that no one will forget. I liked this book because it shows the reality of love and life. You don't always live happily ever after with your true love because of the way our lives are supposed to turn out and what God has in plan for our life.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Best TV legal drama I have seen in awhile.  I love the acting. A+ performance by lead and guest stars. Michael J. Fox is fantastic in this show.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This story (not good enough to be called a book) is poorly written.  How many times can this perfect &#34;Virgin&#34; sleep with this &#34;Stud&#34; and not connect!  Give me a break!  This story goes nowhere...I read about half way through, then discarded it.  If you are a &#34;loved starved&#34; tween...it may capture your attention....if you don't mind being bored to death!
B009S33I68|5.0|I decided to read this after recently seeing the movie.  So far it has been as good as the movie.  As you can imagine it gives more background information.  It also goes through battles that took place afterward.
1401941893|4.0|My expectations were so low and this book really surprised me.  The author is sincere about self-acceptance and self-esteem.  Her job as a model requires it.  Therefore, I sense she knows what she's talking about.<br /><br />This is an ideal book for girls that don't know what to make of all the attention they're getting from boys.  This problem is real and can't be avoided.  Miranda Kerr reached out to that audience with this book.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|This game is surprisingly addicting, I have been playing it off and on since I downloaded it the options for upgrades is very helpful and adds depth to each attempt.

B005NQ5LSC|5.0|great movie!<br />there was a little more drama than action compared to the previous movies. overall 5 stars. everyone should experience \\"Ip Man\\". EVERYONE!!!!
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|This is based on a true story, and the movie attempts to stick pretty close to reality.  Being set in reality has its piquing moments and also some nap time periods.  The actors give reliable performances, and everything looks convincingly real.  Despite the harrowing odds, one is apt to believe that all will turn out well in the end.  This is an odd estimation given the severe challenges involved, but something keeps telling you that the family has more than hope on their side.  The film is primarily engrossing, so I can recommend it for what it is.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is extraordinary It almost made me cry when I read it I felt like I was there I felt what she felt the pains and the happiness

B000ZNRBK4|5.0|I think it's pricey for what feels like semi-durable plastic, but the lens hood is super easy and quick to attach and detach.<br />I don't really take professional pictures so I cannot attest to the necessity of a lens hood in general, but I cannot emphasize enough the sheer functionality and ease of use.<br /><br />If you want a general comparison of the texture/feeling, look at your Nikon D5100 and touch the built-in-flash when it's down--it feels similar to that slightly textured black plastic.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Accidentally came upon this series during an International flight. Watched the three episodes that were available and I was hooked. As soon as I returned home, I looked the show up and bought the entire season. Although as the shows progress in the series, some have been a little too far fetched or kooky but I remain a fan because after all... it IS a super-hero story.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Yes I have loved this series.  I expected so much more from this book....the LAST one.  So I hate to say I was disappointed.  It was obvious that the author wanted to wrap up a lot of the past characters in this one book...but it left the dramatic storyline between sookie, Eric and the queen flat....that storyline ended very boring.  I do like who she ended up with in the end....but it lacked passion that I was hoping for.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I was skeptical about these two being paired up as the leads. I really wanted to like this film. Unfortunately, their love affair was completely unconvincing (her part more than his). I did give it one more star than The Lucky One, but all in all... I wasted my money again.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have read and reread all of the Sookie books because I live them so much. I waited impatiently for this last book only to read it and then have severe buyers remorse.  I feel that I completely wasted my money on this book. The characters were almost unrecognizable. I am as disappointed in this book as I have been after trying to watch the first true blood ( and my last)
1401324649|5.0|...book I've read in a long time.  Looking back, I can see a serendipity overdose, but it doesn't matter.  Somehow it made me a believer.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This isnt an 'entertainment' type of movie. It isnt about action sequences or seeing OBL getting his head blown off at the end. Its a serious depiction of the hit-or-miss and seemingly impossible nature of tracking OBL down, and just the sheer doggedness of certain people to see it through. Treating this like any old action picture is extremely ignorant IMO. Go and rent the Bourne Legacy if you're that damn narrow minded about being entertained. What happened was real. The effort was real. And the Boston bombings point the kind of havoc would be happening ALL the time if it werent for what happens behind the scenes. This is a serious movie about a serious subject.
B00BMKDTNC|1.0|Sad that Robert Jordan passed and could not finish the series. You can tell that Jordan's notes were not fleshed out for this book.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Normally I can read an interesting book in a couple of days, it took me 2 weeks to read this book, it didn't hold my interest. I got so sick of Abby not knowing what she wanted, then I had to keep telling myself that these characters are kids. This book was recommended by a friend, who have always shared great books, this one for me was a dud! Moving on to the next book.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Andy Weir has a winner here. A well-written story of life-and-death for a stranded astronaut on Mars and his use of all his training, determination to not only stay alive but survive in a situation where most would just give up, and know-how in the face of incredible adversity, right up to the harrowing rescue attempt getting him off Mars and... Well, I don't want to keep you from finding out for yourself how it turns out for the space pirate! Told with humor and real knowledge of the space exploration programs, it was well worth the cost.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|*** Second Review 9/7/2014 ***<br /><br />I originally reviewed (see below) Joe Bonamassa's An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House about a year and a half ago as my first Bonamassa live album (after my introduction to Bonamassa on Driving Towards the Daylight).  Here I give you my revised take in light of his complete catalog of studio and live recordings.<br /><br />One could argue that Bonamassa had been building to this album over his last half dozen or so albums.  Bonamassa is joined by recent bandmate Arlan Schierbaum (keys) and newcomers Lenny Castro (percussion), Irish multi-instrumentalist Jerry O'Conner (various strings), and Swede Mats Wester (nyckelharpa).  I had the privilege of seeing this cast for the opening half of Bonamassa's show back in April, and I gained a new appreciation for what they did here.<br /><br />While it is not new concept for an artist to perform an all-acoustic set, this is the first one that Bonamassa released from his expansive catalog.  I loved what they did with the opening of \\"Slow Train\\".  The musical simulation of a train starting is even more impressive than it is on the studio version on Dust Bowl.  I also thought that the acoustic interpretations of \\"The Ballad Of John Henry\\" and \\"Jockey Full Of Bourbon\\" brought out subtleties that aren't there on the studio versions.  Other songs were tailor made for an acoustic set in \\"Around The Bend\\", \\"Richmond\\", \\"Jelly Roll\\", and \\"Black Lung Heartache\\".<br /><br />Each musician performs at an elite level for the entire show, and Bonamassa shows true class.  As a frontman, he gives each of the other musicians plenty of feature time, and he gives each of them credit in their introduction to the audience.  It is rare to see such humility combined with such talent.  I could go on and on, but let me close by saying that this was the crowning achievement Bonamassa's career at the time of its release (it would later be topped by the Tour de Force recordings, but that is a story for another time).  If you are a Joe Bonamassa fan, you simply have to have this this album.<br /><br />Overall:  A+<br /><br />*** Original Review ***<br /><br />Joe Bonamassa has become a prolific recording artist between his studio albums, collaborations, and live recordings; and I can barely keep up with all of it.  I greatly enjoyed his first offering with Beth Hart as well as Driving Towards the Daylight.  I heard previews of An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House prior to its release, and I couldn't wait for it to come out.  It takes a little time to digest a double album, but I've finally gathered my thoughts.<br /><br />This double album has a great blend of songs from different points in Bonamassa's career, but the change to acoustic instrumentation is the real story here.  I loved the intro to \\"Slow Train\\" with the instrument-simulated train gaining steam with the fiddle playing the part of the whistle.  Other highlights include \\"Jockey Full Of Bourbon\\", \\"Dust Bowl\\", and \\"Athens To Athens\\", but really, each song is masterfully performed.<br /><br />To that end, I really have to tip my hat to Bonamassa.  One of the problems that plagues many great artists is ego; however, you will observe that antithesis of such behavior on this collection of songs.  The solos and instrumentals feature all instruments rather than always showcasing Joe's fine guitar work.  He even calls out different musicians for the performances along the way.  Don't get me wrong.  Bonamassa's guitar playing and vocals shine on these songs too, but I loved the fact that he was confident enough to share the spotlight.  He's a great combination of talent and class, and I can't wait for his second recording session with Beth Hart to come out later this month.<br /><br />An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House is a *must* have for Joe Bonamassa fans.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Download this:  \\"Slow Train\\"Bonamassa fan, you simply have to have this this album.

B00BUCW54Q|2.0|I did not like  this movie at all. It would have been just a so-so thriller at best. After reading an interview with Lee Child about the movie, I set aside my skepticism that Tom Cruise could fill Jack Reacher's shoes. Lee Child said that Tom Cruise is such a good character actor that after 3 minutes watching the movie one would find him believable. Nope. The movie was all wrong, nothing like the books. I like  Cruise, but he was not at all believable as Reacher. I love the Reacher books and I have read every one of them.  and am looking forward to the next.

1588167461|5.0|It is not a subject that most men admit to, but honestly we all want to look better, or atleast want to be treated better, and while very little can be taught you to change on the inside, this book can sure help you look like you deserve respect, because with the basics provided here you can make a much stronger first impression.  for all the rebelliousness we have, it seems rather nonconformist to aspire to a higher sense of style, but this rebellion will open door. and the handbook of style is the place to start planning your first battles.

1451695195|4.0|I found the beginning of the book very interesting.  The author seems very credible.  The end of the book became very detailed and technical.  Hard for me to understand.  On a whole it was a good book on the subject of life after death.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Rod Stewart is the original storyteller and he is back. Rod has always had the talent of creating heart felt stories in his songs that resonate with the audience. It is good to see that he has not lost that ability. All the songs on Time tell a story from his personal life, which makes this album more tangible. And while Rod has never been one afraid to show his vulnerability in his songs, these songs coming from him at this stage of his life offers more exposure.<br />I think it is unfair to compare this album to his earlier works although these songs will become classics because they can stand on their own as Rod Stewart songs.<br />He also shows he still has the ability to rock it up, with songs like Finest Woman, Beautiful Morning  and She Make Me Happy and perform a gut wrenching ballad like It's Over and Time. His voice is still distinguishable since no one can sound like Rod.<br />I recommend this album to all Rod Stewart fans, specially those glad to see him do his original music, which he has not done in the past decade or so.<br />Welcome back Rod!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am so disappointed especially because it was the last book. It lacked passion and excitement. It almost felt as a reader that it was half heartedly put together.  Love the series but not this book.

B0009VSB06|4.0|Very happy with this detector.  Once you learn how to use the settings to discriminate junk from treasure, it makes detecting much more fun and profitable.  The detector has excellent electronics for discrimination capability and is much more accurate and capable than I thought it would be.  I was finding treasure quickly after getting it and the more I use it, the better I become at understanding its capabilities.  The only thing I wish it had is a volume adjustment for the beeping.  Other than that, I have no complaints.  I would highly recommend this detector for novice or experienced users.

0857933779|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1FADBUXRQPRBI]]CONCERNED WITH DESIGN RATHER THAN LITIGATION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />It's a wonderful, and novel, jurisprudential concept to look at the law (and possibly legal theory) as a design with devices similar to those used by engineers rather than as the basis of a philosophical set of rules to guide our behaviour.<br /><br />David Howarth has trodden a courageous path here by offering a new approach which is set out in his innovative work \\"Law as Engineering\\" from Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.<br /><br />The book is well referenced throughout as one would expect with Elgar's highly academic publications. Howarth's starting point really begins in chapter 2- what do lawyers do?- when he writes: \\"The popular image of lawyers is all about litigation\\".<br /><br />This sweeping observation is very much the perception of the general public, especially concerning what one performs as Counsel in court.  Of course, in reality it's just one of many activities which lawyers perform but the concept leads on to chapter 3 - \\"law-as-engineering\\" - which is the heart of the book.<br /><br />In chapter 3 Howarth states: what is the service that lawyers offer their clients? This is where we actually think about what we give: the comparison between the function of a lawyer and an engineer is compared and contrasted to identify those matters which are common to both jobs.  It is a bit technical but it is a fair point!<br /><br />On the basis that Howarth has provided a justification for his thesis, he then goes on to examine its main implications. They cover the role of professional ethics, legal research and teaching which offer many similarities between the two occupations/functions thus strengthening his basic view.<br /><br />The concluding chapter reviews Howarth's thesis and examines the 4 possible objections to treating law as a form of engineering.<br /><br />For jurisprudential purposes they comprise: (1)although it might be true in quantitative terms that lawyers mainly engage in activity that can be described in terms of engineering, in some other, qualitative, sense, those activities are not as important as litigation and adjudication.<br /><br />(2) law-as-engineering is merely the latest in a line of instrumentalist conceptions of law- it being a mistake to treat law as a means to an end.<br />(3) treating law as a form of engineering encourages manipulative behavior that fails to respect human autonomy.<br /><br />(4) law-as-engineering breaks the link between law and justice and replaces it with a technocratic view imbued with the worst aspects of legal positivism.<br /><br />There is always a place for a new concept in the incomplete and developing world of jurisprudence and Howarth treats us to a delightful option which will amuse some, baffle others but generally adds to the continuing legal and philosophical debate which is the new twenty-first century jurisprudence.al purposes they comprise: (1)although it might be true in quantitative terms that lawyers mainly engage in activity that can be described in terms of engineering, in some other, qualitative, sense, those activities are not as important as litigation and adjudication.<br /><br />(2) law-as-engineering is merely the latest in a line of instrumentalist conceptions of law- it being a mistake to treat law as a means to an end.<br />(3) treating law as a form of engineering encourages manipulative behavior that fails to respect human autonomy.<br /><br />(4) law-as-engineering breaks the link between law and justice and replaces it with a technocratic view imbued with the worst aspects of legal positivism.<br /><br />There is always a place for a new concept in the incomplete and developing world of jurisprudence and Howarth treats us to a delightful option which will amuse some, baffle others but generally adds to the continuing legal and philosophical debate which is the new twenty-first century jurisprudence.

In over 28 chapters, the new tribunal system is explained and elaborated upon, focusing initially on how appeals begin for both direct and indirect taxes.<br /><br />The appeal process is then logically explained from the beginning all the way to the Supreme Court.  There are chapters, too, dealing with specific issues such as costs, alternative dispute resolution, judicial review, European law and the impact of human rights, as each of these areas pertains to tax appeals.  Also there is useful coverage of HMRC's internal review process.<br /><br />Written by two acknowledged experts in this field, the book is a treasure trove of specific and logically organised information and research tools, with extensive tables of cases, legislation and statutory instruments, not to mention a handy list of abbreviations and an index at the back.  There are seven appendices, including three on Tribunal procedure and rules, plus practice directions and practice statements.<br /><br />Accessible, easily navigable and logically structured, this is a great guidebook for the practitioner under pressure.  This edition reflects the law as at 20 December 2012.great guidebook for the practitioner under pressure.  This edition reflects the law as at 20 December 2012.

B00AEVU2HQ|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2M9EWVXPM4FTS]]SIR WILLIAM GARROW: THE DRAMA AND THE REALITY AT THE BIRTH OF ADVERSARIAL TRIAL<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />To answer the important point in Bryan Gibson's excellent Preface to this most useful companion to John Hostettler's main work, yes, the book is a serious historic guide for all those viewers enthralled by the TV series \\"Garrow's Law\\". It plugs our gaps of knowledge about the reality of the BBC TV drama in both a fair and balanced way to set the record straight.<br /><br />To many people the study of history is quite disgusting as a subject because the reality is often masked by the creation of myths to hide what has really happened and make it more `homely and loveable'. So, if in doubt about the truth and the legend... then print the legend!<br /><br />Legal history in particular is not something lawyers can be proud of concerning sentencing and the original processes of the development of the early common law in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, we learn much from the life of William Garrow and Hostettler's companion to the series is most welcome.<br /><br />Garrow's position is now assured as the pathfinder of modern the adversarial system which has been recognized internationally as the basis of a sound legal system. So what did Garrow achieve? Hostettler sets out to find the truth behind the myths, and he undertakes the task with brilliance and accuracy.<br /><br />What we have with this new book from Waterside Press is a compliment the BBC series with well-researched details about the three seasons of stories which have been filmed, and the individual cases arising in the episodes which are more extensively explored from the base of historical fact, however horrific it may seem to us today with the excessive use of hanging.<br /><br />`Garrow's Law' was watched by some 5 million people who were captivated by the storylines. What Hostettler does is set the scene of the times in which Garrow lived and the picture we conjure up is compelling. We found this a riveting read from cover to cover and it is a wonderful companion to the BBC series which was so desired by all `Garrowites'.<br /><br />Thank you, Bryan Gibson from Waterside Press, and John Hostettler for giving us this extra historic treat to complement the series!tettler does is set the scene of the times in which Garrow lived and the picture we conjure up is compelling.

B005UKJX4E|2.0|Tree of Life has moments of brilliance but the parts do not match the whole. Art such as film and books involve choices and Malick does not know when to let go. I hear he actually edits several hours into two to three so I guess he does feel he's editing out most of his material. Someone should tell him that unless he's making a miniseries, movies do not lend themselves to this kind of indulgence. You either have something to say or you don't. Some may feel that we have to think this one through. I personally feel it's overwritten (like The Thin Red Line). Too many unnecessary cryptic voiceovers. The floating camera captures beautiful movements but when it goes on and on it loses effectiveness and you start getting restless. Tree of Life had so much potential but lost it by being so pretentious. Choices, Malick, choices. You could have made two maybe three great films from these ideas instead of one meandering, long, boring one that does not add up to its ambitions.<br /> By the way, I am 52 years old and have seen it all. I am not one of those people who was brought up on action films of today. Slow is nice. The movie Witness had slow moments but was always intriguing. In the Bedroom is another example (though less so).<br />Malick like Kubrick is a real talent. This does not mean we can't criticize their work. Sometimes they hit and sometimes they miss. The Emperor has no clothes.

B009NY43NY|1.0|Charlaine Harris really should have quit writing this series after book 5. She continues the format of re-hashing what's happened in the previous book for about 1/4 the length of the book, and has little to no character development in this. All in all worthless drivel, and not even the fun kind.

B0015RFCZ0|5.0|There's some great music in this flick which is why I also bought the sound track. Besides your basic love story, boy meets girl they fall in love. Boy looses girl only to find her again is the story of &#34;August Rush&#34; an amazing little boy full of wonder and talant that pulls the whole story together.<br /><br />I have to say I think Robin Williams was miscast in this film. He just didn't seem to fit. Other than that I really liked it.
0553801473|4.0|I found this to be the weakest of the series so far. Martin's writing is as spellbinding as ever, but when you look back not much happened in the story. I will say the last third of the book picked up quite a bit, but for a book this size, you want a little more progression. I found the epilogue to be especially teasing. Volumes 4 and 5 seem to be great illustrations of Martin's facility with words, but both lacked the energy of the first three books. Still, when the writing is this good, I will be among the audience.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|&#34;Horror&#34; is putting it mildly.  The characters were well-defined and some of them were so creepy, it made the hair on my neck stand up.

If you want to be scared out of your mind (no pun intended), &#34;Asylum&#34; is for you.

B00BDSRISA|2.0|I like or love every song on every album by this band, until now.  I just don't get this one at all.  On the one hand it's great for artists to take risks. On the other, a bad melody is just bad.  I can withstand a couple tunes on here, but in comparison to past albums where every single song I went for... count me disappointed.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Their first album was definitely better, Sigh No More. Still, I do enjoy the more banjo-heavy album that Babel presents, and it's altogether very good music. The only real complaint one could have is that all their songs sound the same, but since I like that same sound, I don't really mind it. Good band, good music, good lyrics that really get down to what our spirits are on the inside. Rather thought provoking.

1400069807|5.0|This is a very long, very thorough, and exceedingly well written book. It takes us on a long tour of the processed food industry.<br /><br />Michael Moss states that this book is \\"intended as a wake-up call to the issues and tactics at play in the food industry, to the fact that we are not helpless facing them down.\\" Certain themes recur throughout the book. Here are a few: the interchangeable nature of salt, sugar and fat, meaning that when one of them is is targeted as unhealthy the others can be increased, the dog-eat-dog nature of the processed food industry - sometimes tens of thousands of jobs hanging in the balance, the use of tactics similar to those of the the cigarette industry, the targeting of children and heavy marketing in low income areas, the insane competition between brands and in grocery stores for prime space. Also, the research of food scientists to come up with the perfect  \\"mouthfeel,\\" \\"bliss point,\\" etc.,  the overall lack of accountability within corporations and what happens to individuals who have a conscience within those industries, the undeniable effects of all of this on our nation's waistline and health risk factors, and the ridiculous and outrageous health claims made - flavored yogurt sometimes having more sugar than cereal that's basically candy. Moss covers all of this and way, way more,  and the stories he tells are as riveting as they are shocking.<br /><br />More unsettling than any of that is the realIzation that we ourselves have fueled much of this with our busy, erratic work schedules, our desire to reward ourselves with food, and the decline of home cooking and family meals.<br /><br />Moss's chapter on the role of the government in all of this is also profoundly disturbing. There is an immense amount of information in this book: facts upon facts and innumerable fascinating stories. Though the writing does slow down on occasion, overall the tension and suspense grow from chapter to chapter, as in a good novel. By the end Iwas fired up and ready for a plan to fix all of this. Fortunately, we have the work of Michael Pollan, David Kessler, and Mark Bittman and others like them to help us with that.<br /><br />Highly recommended to those who wish to feel a little more in control of their lives, resist corporate badgering, and perhaps establish healthier habits.

B009LMTDL0|2.0|Question: When is a book not a book.<br /><br />Answer: When it has 37 footnotes by the 24th page.<br /><br />Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead by Sheryl Sandberg is nothing more than a thesis paper thinly disguised and marketed by the publishing company as the next &#34;it&#34; book for women. Well...not all women; at least in my mind.<br /><br />Why, you ask?  The reality is that most women are never going to get the opportunity to work in a Fortune 500 company as an executive. Now that's not to say that women won't have opportunities to work in large or mid-size corporations. Let's face it. Most top level jobs are already taken, and if the company is worth its salt, the chance for advancement is slim because those at the top like their jobs and tend to stay, especially when the company is well established and appreciates their staff.<br /><br />So what kind of message is Ms. Sandberg sending to the average American woman? On the surface, I can't quite figure it out. Perhaps we need to dig a little deeper here. If her book is merely a dissertation on the battle between the sexes and the inequality of paychecks, then sadly, the author is really behind the times and she hasn't told us anything that we haven't already heard.<br /><br />However, if she is saying that we, as women, will never be happy unless we occupy every top level executive position in the country, well then, I beg to differ! What if our mothers decided they didn't want to be our mothers and just wanted to climb that corporate ladder, then where would we be? What if I don't want to be a top level executive at a Fortune 500 company? Can't I be happy doing exactly what I am doing right now? What if I don't want to be a leader? What if there are other women who don't want to be leaders? Is being a leader the only road to happiness? I think not. I have a lot of will and ambition, but my desires don't necessarily point me in that direction.<br /><br />But, let's take this a little further. Ms. Sandberg says on page 10 (Kindle version) that she &#34;would never advocate that we should have the same objectives. Many people are not interested in acquiring power, not because they lack ambition, but  because they are living their lives as they desire....We each have to chart our own unique course and define which goals fit our lives, values and dreams.&#34; This is great, however, the overall message of the book makes it seem that the only correct life choice that we, as women, should have is to be on that corporate ladder climbing toward the top rung to obtain equality. She says on page 10 (Kindle version)  &#34;If we succeed in adding more female voices at the highest levels, we will expand opportunities and extend fairer treatment to all.&#34;<br /><br />Now that the author has highly advocated that we, as women, should go for that top rung, and we succeed in adding more women to top level positions, where's the guarantee that fairer treatment and equality will occur? Also, while I thank her for supporting us in making choices, but then tell us in the next breath that we, as women, should all be leaning into our careers to level the playing field just seems to send out a mixed message. And, let's not even talk about the underlying subtext of the &#34;you should be doing it this way because this is the way I did it, I know it works, and you will be successful and happy if you do it this way.&#34; With so many inconsistencies throughout this book, it makes it difficult to see what the real point is here.<br /><br />To circle back around to the very beginning of my review, this entire book reads like a master's thesis paper for one of Sandberg's Harvard classes. While I can appreciate the fact that she loves to &#34;rely on hard data and academic research&#34; (page 9, Kindle version), some of us would have just preferred her thoughts on the subject backed up by her real life experiences. The 227 footnotes is a little excessive and limits the audience from any opportunity to flush out the details, not to mention the loss of flow while reading due to constantly having to flip back and forth between the book and the footnotes. How are we as the readers suppose to know if these thoughts are really hers or those that were referenced? And, who really has time to read through, in depth, all of these footnotes, including researching the sources of those said footnotes? Certainly not myself.<br /><br />Now, I will admit that there are some principals in this book that can be followed and adapted to fit every women's life. (Note: It took until almost the last couple of chapters to find some kernels of wisdom. Any hope of finding something earlier in the book is simply lost within the text stemming from the research and footnotes.) Perhaps these few morsels were the real intent of the book, but the message simply was too muddied up in her intelligentsia. As a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Business school, there is no doubt that Sheryl is a smart woman; however, she would have better served her audience if she had spoken to us and not above us. As a college graduate, I have the capability of dissecting and extrapolating information; however, others might not be able to do so, or if they were it would be with great difficulty. Perhaps there is something here, I just don't see it. Maybe it got lost in the translation.<br /><br />Overall, I think the message to &#34;lean in&#34; to &#34;whatever&#34; could have been delivered with a little less reliance on statistics and information from other sources. The one thing the book failed to mention is after we, as women, work so hard to get to the top rung, what do we do when we get there? It seems that the author and her colleagues have spent too much time climbing the corporate ladder, missing out on having some fun and losing the opportunities to be truly creative and produce something that will leave a lasting mark on the world, other than to say, I was the CEO/COO (or some other high level position) of such and such company. As for me, I would rather not strive for the top rung, but hang back a few steps, and enjoy the creativity and fun afforded to me at that level while enjoying life a whole lot more.ng due to constantly having to flip back and forth between the book and the footnotes.

1451613512|1.0|The author obviously does not like America and tries to find ways to portray things in the most negative way as possible.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The Best of Me is another really good book of Nichols Sharks. I enjoy all of his books please keep writing. I have read all of them.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I liked that I could purchase all three books. I only wished that the Amazon book app had set the book up so you knew what page you were on on each book, not the page based on how many pages were in the entire trilogy.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Bridget Jones is so funny. I can watch it over and over again. I hope they make more films together.

0374531269|4.0|Children in the midst of war experience crimes with a different state of mind. Their vivid imaginations can take them right back to any scene and replay it over and over within their minds, each detail becoming more and more imbedded as time passes.  Ismeal Beah shares his childhood of survival and bloodshed in A Long Way Gone. This compelling biography sends the reader from the battlefield of Sierra Leone, West Africa; to the tribulation that Beah experiences as he is forced to serve in the resistance army. The novel is not a difficult read so much as it is heart wrenching. As a women, it is impossible to describe the pain that these mothers must have felt knowing that their sons are forced to kill their people, and often their own neighbors and family members; daughters being raped and then murdered because they had no use for them. On the other hand, the government is to involved in the selling of Sierra Leone's diamonds to lend much help. This novel shines a light on the struggles of the villagers and the devastation of these young boys who are to young to fight back are thrown into this civil war that leaves them with nothing but blood on their hands. Beah puts his soul into this novel and forces others to realize that they should be happy with their blessed lives in suburbia.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A thriller!  You might suspect the answer to the mystery but certainty evades you until the lightning fast denouement.  Couldn't put it down.  Buying these Baldacci novels may financially break me.
B0090SI460|5.0|I just love this movie and with it be 3d just made it more interesting. Had trouble with the first copy but it was corrected without any issues!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I don't really care for these &quot;running&quot; games, but I like the flying orientation of this game. Our helps that it is Iron man and a game by gameloft
B008E6I1K8|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best C# reference in print.<br /><br />In the rush to meet publishing and production deadlines, many authors hastily throw together their subject matter in a best-efforts basis and, often, barely finish pressing the 'Enter' key before the presses start rolling.  No so with C# 5.0 in a Nutshell.  This book is brilliantly organized, exceptionally well-written, and provides truly useful examples for day-to-day c# coding.  Broad subject matter coverage with just the right depth and numerous examples make owning and using this book a pleasure.<br /><br />If you're a C# developer, or aspire to become one, you'll find this book to be one of the few gems on your shelf.  I would opt for the print rather than the Kindle version -- simply because good reference books are destined to be dog-eared, stickynote-tagged and thrown in a backpack: in that light, when you buy this book, you'll find that the corners of your book will quickly be curled and worn with the spine creased and pages dogtagged.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Being a military buff and having watched the documentaries on Military and History channel regarding this subject; this film is pretty accurate. The film is very graphic as to what we (CIA) do to individuals to collect intelligence. But I don't think we are any different then any other country. I have personally known individuals connected with special ops, CIA and other covert organizations, and because of them we as a Nation sleep better at night.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's a good game to play in small increments. Each mini game is only a few objects. As you earn more energy. Very similar to Facebook's Mafia game.
0374214913|5.0|I loved this book. It is an engaging mystery revolving around ancient texts narrated by a digital native. Lots of interesting characters, plot twists, and puzzles.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I cant find it on my kindle? Looked 4 times? Help? Any advice to find it anyone?thanks!  I'm sure id love it just like the other ones!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I read the book, including a marathon over 11 days reading the first 12 before \\"Dead Ever After\\" came out. It was well-written and brought the series to a satisfying end. Is it perfect? Not quite. A few more details on some of the closing out of characters would have been nice. Oh, and the continuity editor was napping because in the course of 3 pages the home fries that one character was making became French fries. (There were other continuity errors in the entire series, for which I hold her publisher accountable. None were all that horrid, but they still bugged me.) I do admit to being confused by Harris' decision to use the 3rd person narrative in small sections, which she's never done before in this series. I don't think those parts did anything to add to the book. Other than these points, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I'm sorry to see the world of Sookie Stackhouse come to an end as I thoroughly enjoyed reading of her adventures in it.<br /><br />Might I have made different decisions in the series? Possibly. But, I love the books that Charlaine Harris wrote, and I respect her decisions within them. Regarding the much discussed ending: I'm fine with it. I've long loved the character Sookie ends up with, and find that final choice to be 100% fine and true to the characters. It wasn't out of the blue, having been suggested as a possibility over the years.<br /><br />Thank you, Ms. Harris, for a great series and a wonderful ending.
B008EKOIN8|1.0|I purchased the book after seeing Pollan on Dr. Oz.  I do not recommend this book.  I will donate the book to the local library but I don't think it's even worthy of that.  He goes into way too much detail on roasting a pig. And after a few pages into that, I basically just skimmed the book, skipping whole pages at a time.  I have to say I wasn't interested in one thing he wrote about; nothing could hold my attention.  I'm sure there are some that would benefit from this book; unfortunately, I'm not one of them.
B00006B1HH|4.0|The Gold standards never die.  This was a gift fot my 17 year old granddaughter for her birthday.  We had taken her 42 year old mother to see it 30 years ago.
B000JTAUNO|4.0|This live album captures the band in their early period. Their foot stomping and leg shaking peak. Certainly a great live band!
B000SW4DV2|5.0|Love this movie.  Never fails to make me laugh when watching with the grandkids.  Oh, and more important, the kids LOVE this movie!  Time to buy it instead of renting it every few months!!
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I wouldn't have minded the ending of this book if I had felt that Charlaine Harris was comitted to it herself, or if she had foreshadowed and set it up for her readers over the course of the earlier books. The ending, which felt hastily thrown together, was, quite frankly, incredibly disappointing, and felt at odds with what we had already learnt of Sookie's character. Whatsmore Charlaine Harris' attitude to her readers over their reaction to this book (a book which concludes a series which many of them, myself included, have invested time, money and thought in to) has ensured that I will never again buy or read another book written by her.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addictive!!  I can't stop playing.  I play every chance that I get.  Makes you think and strategize.  Can be very time consuming.  Great when waiting at an appointment, doctor, dentist, car wash.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This show is amazing....Kurt Sutter has done it again... Fast paced and entertaining and a hit of humor...love the Gemma and Jax storyline...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a terrific story. The plot has lots of twists and turns. I thought I had the ending all figured out but was wrong. Great book for bookclubs.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Very we'll written and directed series. If u like the terminator but u have a hard time understanding it's paradox then this show will help explain. The show follows what the original creator in visioned with a twist. This was a good show and when originally aired it was put on the Friday Night line up so it was doomed to fail. I wish it has ended better...
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Well. it's a rear lens cap - and it fits.  What more is there to say?<br />Since I am told I need four more words ...  :)
B002O2THRO|4.0|We thought the movie was pretty good. Loved the theme of the roaring 20's & the costuming was great. Intriguing & tragic love story
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I was a great film and a great story line but some of the actor's lines were a bit over the top and the film could have been a bit more serious as well as more developed. This could've been a 3-hour film.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|N Sparks seems to be repeating his story lines and this time, he didnt do such a good job with it.  I got bored even as I wanted to protect the heroine.  Ended way too fake.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I loved this book.  Pamela Druckerman is always right on when she speaks about French parenting.  I am a French born and raised, and I left France at age 18 to study in the USA.  I never made it back to France.  I have lived half of my life in the USA.  I do not have kids of my own, but I am old enough to have seen most of my siblings and friends raise kid #2.This is also why this book is so compelling.  It helps me understand the differences between both countries, and it is fascinating.  It also helped me understand the younger generations here in the USA (and I also mean \\"college\\" level).  I cannot believe that after 18 years in this country I am still learning about the culture.  In short, I loved this book because it was accurate to a T, it was a fun and very informative read, and it was well written.  I tell all my friends (men and women, w or w/o kids) to read it, and I bought it for one of my friend. I am going to read her other books now.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|As long as you realise it is a time sink it is enjoyable...don't get caught up in the money sink aspect.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|this movie feels like real life. outstanding! heat felt, raw, funny, dramatic. you can actually feel your heart strings pull and your funny bone twinge as the characters steal your heart.  five stars.
B004W1GCVE|4.0|We watched and enjoyed both seasons of this show.  The characters were believable and I think well developed. Because of these two seasons we attempted to watch the original series.  We found the characters much flatter and not as well developed.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought overall it was well written. I enjoyed the mystery of who the recipient of the letters might be.
193700788X|1.0|Total and Complete let down! Why even drag the story out for 12 books if all she was going to do was end it in like this. HORRIBLE
0345803493|3.0|The only reason..i bought the  second book  is because ..book # 1...leaves you hanging..wondering what will happen to them  next...It was just so..so..nothing to write home about...glad i bought it used and in great condition for 3.00 on Amazon...Then i purchased book # 3..which is on it's way to me in about a week... we will see how that book fares!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am so disappointed with &#34;Dead After&#34;  I think Charlaine Harris just &#34;gave up&#34; on the last novel.  Of course I want Sookie and Eric to be together. I would even take Bill... But Sam?? Really? The chemistry with Eric was HOT! The chemistry with Sam.. NOT! Totally boring! I do not want to know what happens to Sookie after (Oct 2013 companion book)You already ruined it for me.... Unless Sookie is back with Eric :)
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I like this book but I thought it was a little slow starting.  I did like the way it developed though.  Character development was pretty good too.
B008HLZUUE|5.0|Not my favorite book in the series but the actual condition was very well made. No complaints from me. Yippe!
B007VTUYWW|5.0|From video game to the big screen very few movies can Do it well. This one DOES...a real must watch even if you no nothing about the video game.
193700788X|2.0|I was very excited after reading Deadlocked to find out how the Sookie series would end. I pre-ordered Dead Ever After with great anticipation, but was sadly disappointed. The story seemed rushed, with no real plot. The story jumped around, with very little depth into what was going on in the characters lives. I do not want to give any spoilers for those who have not read the book. My unhappiness is not based on how the story ended, but rather on 10 years of dedication to these characters, only to be rushed through with no real sense of closure. It made me sad, and I felt a little betrayed by the finished product. I know Charlaine Harris is suppose to release a book this October to sum up everyone's ever after, so I guess I will have to wait and see if that book can give me the closure I was looking for In Dead Ever After.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this one is so much better than the first one because you can get gems to save ya and all that good stuff. next they need go make a temple run 3!
B00BBW15R8|5.0|This was so good Both lead actors were amazingly good. The dance scene will live on in my mind for years. I went and downloaded earth wind and fire music in celebration of this movie. After seeing this wonderful movie it makes me want another one! I give it a ten. Everyone will love it
B003O86FMW|3.0|Read the first book. Not super impressed. Gave up on the series until I saw the previews for the Book 2 movie. Still not Harry Potter. Still won't watch the movies. But I will read the Book 3.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|great western.  Lee marvin plays a cowboy near the turn of the century when real cowboys were out of work and trying to get by without doing the only job they knew well.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|It takes a few episodes to really get to understand what is going on.  It is a bit complex and the characters have a lot of depth.  Best series on TV right now!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I like sci-fi/fantasy stuff, but so much of it is badly written. I also like literature, and this reads more like that than your typical fantasy novel. Interesting character development, clear story. Keeps you turning pages.
1878424319|5.0|Simple and enjoyable read. I wish I had read it 15 years ago.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Sometimes tiles that shoudl be available aren't and visa-versa, but all in all a good game.  Great exercise for the mind.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|Please trust me, this book was fantastic. It not only made me think about many personal things going on in my life, but brought new perspective and depths of thought that were soul enriching.
0062060554|4.0|I got this book because a friend of mine raved about it. I liked it, but it was a bit predictable. I guessed the ending towards the beginning of the book. I read it while on vacation, and it did hold my interest.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It compares favorably to the original Dune. The scope is unbelievably wide and interesting. More stories in this series would be great, unfortunately the author died.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I couldn't stop reading! I now love the author and will read all her books  :)) I hope they make a movie for this one
0399157565|5.0|Another winner for Patricia Cornwell.  I have read all the Scarpetta books and this one did not disappoint. If you are a fan buy and enjoy!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Downloaded the free version. You come across advertisement for other games once in a while, but only when you finish a round. Very fun. Great to play if you're waiting on something/someone/on a plane or something. Lots of levels so I don't see myself beating this game anytime soon.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love spending an hour &#34;away&#34; at Downton Abbey.  It's one hour that I can step into this home and this family and feel what they feel and move about the castle with them.  I find that I even speak with accent for 30 minutes after watching the program.  Is that bad, or what?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|niiiice game do all itrequires  of u  the turotials n u can win alot of things like japan doolss i like the game
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the controls are easy and you can play the game without spending money. I like the different suits and the grafics are clean.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game has no problems now you know theirs very very very very hoo  ads take me you will love it I this bored when I finished the game with all stars cause possibly angry birds is possible.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I was drawn to this series because I love most series/movies that tackle ancient times. However, some succeed where others epically fail. Starz's Spartacus borrowed from several sources not just its well known character. When you look at the series it has the imagery of &#34;300&#34;, the story feels a little like Russel Crowe's &#34;Gladiator&#34; in some aspects, and with the many sex scenes and flesh on display it took it beyond what HBO's &#34;Rome&#34; showed.<br /><br />Now I think Rome & Gladiator were better but Spartacus is pure escapism and its fun. The writing is hilarious, I mean I'm not entirely sure if that's how they spoke in Ancient Rome but it makes the show unique and memorable.<br /><br />If you liked/loved shows like Xena, Hercules, Rome, Buffy then I think you'll appreciate Spartacus.
B0097K21YW|1.0|its on the free list. and its a second version of angry birds. if you like this game u can say so but I don't.  only gave it a star cause I had too
B004HW7JMY|5.0|It really fleshed out some characters, in particular Batiatus, Lucrezia and Onemeaus. It introduced us to a kickass new Gladiator and important figure in the rest of the series, Gannicus.  If you loved all the over the top awesome of season 1 then you will love this prequel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it I can't figure out how to hang out with friends though.  I wish there was water too.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Now the major change to season 2 is that they had to change the lead actor who played Spartacus due to the death of Andy Whitfield. Liam McIntyre does a FANTASTIC job in a difficult position given that Andy did a great job.  However I am happy Starz decided to continue with the show. It takes a few episodes to get used to seeing Liam as Spartacus but it's great.<br /><br />I don't want to get into too much of what happens since the show offers some fabulous twists and turns, but more of the awesome of season 1 continue here.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great game with very nice graphics. Fun game to play to pass the time if you're bored. The biggest problems are that when you get so far then the game freezes or starts over. I've made it to level 26 then it restarted. Very frustrating as this is my 3rd time having to start over and it will be my last if it messes up again.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|It was a very well made film that focused on the immediate aftermath of the Tsunami for this family instead the tsunami itself. I can now see why Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar. I shed a few tears while watching it.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|I have yet to finish this book.  I will, but it just doesn't grip me like it does some.  I will probably end up loving it and then having to edit this review.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book goes back and forth between perspectives of the main characters.  The mystery builds with narratives as reader is drawn into world of each.  Reader begins to understand their problems and why the perfect love is doomed.  The are both so flawed.  At the end I was torn between which to feel sorry for, both were injured.  However, one is psychotic, and I would never sleep well in the house.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|Easy to install and easily links to your home wifi system.  All software should be this simple to use and as reliable.
0545128285|5.0|When I saw another book in the Harry Potter universe, I had to pick it up. This book is definitely in line with the rest of the series, though I do sort of wish it were longer. The stories are short and fun, and I can definitely picture them being read to wizarding children everywhere. The commentary by Albus Dumbledore offers an extra peek into the world Rowling created, giving us a little more insight on wizarding history.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|If you have kids in school this app is worth it. What the kids are now doing in math is beyond me and I can't help them anymore. But they can use this app to check their work.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved this book! It was fascinating and kept my interest the entire way through. I can't wait to try another of Kate Morgan's books. She is very descriptive and easy to picture her characters.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is going into my all time favorites list. This movie had beautiful scenes, great acting, action, romance, comedy, drama, and about everything it between.<br /><br />Yes, it was bloody and a little gory (well a lot), but it stayed true to the time period. I like the fact that nothing was held back. The movie just had great direction.  I loved it and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Over the top, even for Quentin Tarentino.  Not his best movie, lacking in the sly humor that makes his other raw films worth watching.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Can not even download the app. I have played this game on the ipod and I loved it I also wish I could play it on this.
B00A1U2SVS|4.0|This CD is pretty good, but personally, enjoy the music from the band's early years. The songs are pretty much the same but of course older artists don't sound like they did when they were young. I have certainly added less liked music to my library so overall, it is a good addition.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I have been a student of civil war history and especially President Lincoln's, since high school. This picture, focusing on three weeks in January 1865 and Lincoln's push to have the 13th Amendment prohibiting slavery passed, captures that period vividly. All the actors were outstanding, including of course Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln, where he richly deserved receiving the Academy Award for Best Actor. If you are a student of American history, this film is a keeper.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Really good read. Got a bit bogged down at the start but then couldn't put it down.  Did the tiger really exist? I like to think so...
B0061PEAUY|4.0|It started out to be a slow read, sometime too much information, but then pick towards the middle of the book, that's when it got interesting. It is nothing like the series on tv.  I would read another one of Kathy Reichs books again.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I wish it didn't have time restraints but I do really like it. The game is really fun.!!!! I love this game.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I don't want to contribute to any spoilers, so this entire review will be spoiler-free. So rather than talk about the plot, I will talk about my reaction to the book as I read.<br /><br />First 1/3 of the book: Really slow. Nothing happens.<br /><br />Middle 2/3 of the book: Things pick up, the mystery starts. It starts to feel like a Sookie Stackhouse book. But the whole time I'm reading, I'm really wondering how things are going to be resolved. This does not feel like the last book in the series. There's no finality to the scenes, and there's so much left to resolve (like Sookie's fate) that although I'm enjoying it, I'm sort of apprehensive that there aren't enough pages left to wrap this up.<br /><br />The final 10%: WTF. There is a definite scene where things just turn sour, and it feels almost like fan fiction. It just feels weird. The tone is off, everything is rushed, and the writing is generally weaker. Some parts are beyond cringe-worthy and in almost offensively poor taste. Not to mention there is the most unsexy sex scene ever. Here's a line: \\"We slid against each other like seals.\\" Here's another: \\"I feel like I just plowed the back forty with a team of mules.\\"<br /><br />As I close the book: I still like the series as a whole, but this book left a bad taste in my mouth. Mostly the last few chapters. Even Sookie has a line at the end about how stupid it all was. It's not so much that I disagree with what happened, but how it happened. It didn't feel emotionally true. It was rushed. Too many pages were spent on really meaningless crap, and anything of importance was squished into the final 10%. It should have been the other way around. Which is too bad, because I really loved this series, and it deserved a much better ending.<br /><br />The next morning: Thinking about the book was like waking up in bed with the wrong person. All the plot holes starting nagging at me. There are HUGE continuity errors with the very premise of the series. The fates of certain characters also started bothering me more than when I was reading. I tend to be very forgiving as I'm reading, and I really tried not to judge until I read the entire thing. Two things that really really bother me even now: 1) what happens to Eric (I won't say what) and 2) the scene with Sookie in the van at the end. This series was always really gay friendly and accepting, but this scene felt very alienating. This used to be a series that made me feel good, but after reading this, I just felt kinda dirty.<br /><br />If you're reading this Charlaine, I know it's not common practice, but maybe come out with a book 13 1/2, something where Sookie wakes up and Book 13 was all a dream? It might be a cop out, but I honestly don't think anyone would mind.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I am the world's biggest Iron Man fan and this game is better than anything I could have ever expected. I hope that Gameloft will make more superhero games like this.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I've never been a fan of Nicholas Sparks; I read A Walk to Remember when I was in high school at the recommendation of my friends who all cried and went bananas over the book, but I was unimpressed. Since then, I've been turning my nose up at anything having to do with Sparks. And then, for some reason, maybe because it was so cheap, I bought the book Safe Haven on my Kindle, blew through it in no time, and found that I actually enjoyed the story, especially because the book allows readers into the mind of the man after the heroine.<br /><br />It follows then that I had to see this movie.<br /><br />Katie (Julianne Hough) is a girl on the run -- from what the viewers don't know, but it's not that hard to figure out. If you're one of those viewers who falls for every, single thing shown on screen, then what she's running from may come as a surprise, but then I just feel sorry for you. She makes her way from Boston to a small town in (North?) Carolina. Location doesn't matter. What matters is that she's found her \\"safe haven,\\" far from whatever troubles she had been running from. She makes friends with a little girl, Lexie, who's father, Alex (Josh Duhamel), owns the general store right on the water. Katie also makes another friend named Jo, a woman who claims to be a neighbor to Katie's teeny shanty in the woods. Katie frequents the store to buy rice and paint and what not and continues to be friendly with Lexie, which of course interests Alex, as does the mystery of her appearance in the town at all. Cue the mellow tunes, show the waves lapping, show small town people walking down the street, have a parade, catch fish, go canoeing... These things, however, do not mean that this movie is your typical rom-com. I'd call it more of a wannabe thriller/romantic movie. It's not really funny. Forget the com.<br /><br />While I'm glad I didn't pay theater prices, it's worth a rental, especially if you like good looking people frolicking in idyllic settings, making goo goo guys at each other, with a happy ending that'll make you go, \\"Aww...\\" and \\"Holy crap!\\" at the same time (if you haven't read the book that is... if you have, then obviously nothing will come as a surprise.)<br /><br />I was annoyed that Julianne Hough's character, Katie, wasn't as terrified or vulnerable as her novel counterpart. Her genuine fear of men is part of what made the book interesting, and I didn't get the sense at all that she was afraid of Alex in the same way she is in the book. The movie would've been more interesting if they filmmakers had characterized Alex and Katie in the same way. (And don't even bother saying to me, \\"But they have to make changes in order to adapt from page to screen.\\" Bull honky.)<br /><br />Despite the missed opportunities in terms of characterization, I still found myself rooting for Katie, so if you like these two actors, like this book (and won't freak the **** out by some changes), then you'll most likely enjoy this movie.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Buy it and read until you are done. ALMOST the best book in the series's still the last Olympian good book
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was equally as good as the Hunger Games, and again I found myself reading well into the night.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My friend recommended me this game and I was a little skeptical at first but when I finally downloaded it, it was amazing.(Thank you friend)!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great ending to the hunger games trilogy, and I was sorry when they ended.  More pleasemissing them already.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Watch it! This is a great movie for the whole family. Although slightly gory for the really young ones. L
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my daughter and I loved every minute of it, and couldn't wait fot the next in the series.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The Dark Tower series meets Carnivale meets Harry Potter with another 70% of completely new and fascinating fantasy. Heading to download the next book immediately.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved watching the show and the HD quality that Amazon Prime offered was great! I'd definitely recommend this show to others!
B004Q49SWW|5.0|This episode is extremely riveting and has Castle & Beckett at their best.  Despite all of the tension, there is well played softness between Castle & Beckett which has the viewer begging for more.  Streaming this video via Amazon Instant worked well on our computer but when attempted through our Wi-Fi connected Sony DVD player, we got 15 seconds of show and then 30 seconds of download pause.  So if you want TV like viewing, watch via computer hardwired to your cable provider box.
0060930349|5.0|This book should be taught in colleges.  All aspiring for presidential office should be publicly questioned on different US historical events, which so thoroughly discussed in the book.  I guess that such quest would find who is qualified to be included to primary competition for presidential candidacy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a beautiful story full of emotions! At times I was afraid, nervous, angry and sad yet felt each step of this story! That's what a story is suppose to do! I loved it!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The characters are vivid.  Identifiable in our society.  Many of us secretly perform some of the rituals enacted by Don.  None of these cause dismay, as they are an extension of the 'security blanket' which insulates us from the 'real world'.  Enjoy, I did.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like it!!! its one of the games I can play when I dont have wifi. you should get it.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I have been a fan of Rod Stewart since day one. This album does not disappoint in the least. It makes  me want to dance and bop around and some tracks make me cry. It is Rod Stewart back to what he does best and that is writing his own songs and singing  them .Thank you Mr Stewart for all the years , the music and this album.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the books and was really reluctant to watch the movie, but I'm so glad I did!  It was fantastic!  So close to the book, Jennifer Lawrence was great and so was the guy who played Peeta.  They had a good chemistry and I am really glad I finally succumbed and watched it.  Can't wait for the sequels!!!
B00COHAUD4|2.0|This movie follows the same premise that most seem to follow. The story itself had huge potential but the writing was awful. Jessica Chastains portrayal of a \\"rocker girl\\" was plain old laughable and it was obvious that she was playing dress up. I spent the entire movie with my volume remote in hand because of the thousand or so instances where an \\"Orchestra hit\\" or loud noise would attempt to \\"scare\\". The CGI was atrocious and I think the animators mistakenly thought that they did a good enough job as to where we could look at the computer generated \\"Mama\\" for several minutes and not cry foul. Being a Northern Virginia native I noticed quite a few references. Look up \\"Bunny Man Bridge\\" and draw the parallel.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|New Girl is a awesome show, can't wait to buy season two :) It is funny and one the best shows of 2012 :)
B0006HBERA|5.0|My little one loves putting this game together as much as we love playing it.  It is durable and colorful.  She is learning to add and subtract and it's the first thing she grabs on a weekend.  I am definitely gonna try out other games in this brand
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I definitely recommend this book to everyone!!! And I am so proud to have men like Adam fighting for our freedom
B000FCKGPC|1.0|I found myself feeling disgusted about halfways tghrough this book. There is nothing wrong with George R.R. Martin's writing that couldn't be cured by a good editor. Or a dozen editors.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Disturbing and haunting. Simply one of the best science-fiction books ever written. Orson Scott Card delivers a powerful story of the emotional, physical, and psychological damages associated with war in a way that challenges readers to look beyond what they think they know and reach into the unknown. A haunting story that is still beautiful and worth your time!
B005URRCNQ|5.0|This was a gift and I knew it I could trust the source I purchased it from. It met and exceeding my expectations!
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|This is a great movie.  Not much else to say about it really.  Its a good story and put together very well.  Its somewhat long but you wont really notice.
0803731094|5.0|My child enjoys this story the most and she has a variety of books ranging from Pete the Cat to several from the Dr. Seuss collection. I have to admit I enjoy just as much. One night as I was reading it to her for the second time, she fell asleep and I continued to read the story till the end. We both can't get enough from the adorable pictures to the clever rhyme scheme and it also teaches a great lesson.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|I enjoyed this one and didnt want my 2 hours back.  Its a good plot and plays out well with just enough action and just enough other stuff.  Worth watching even if you dont like Tom that much.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|It's a fun game to pass the time and trying to find out what you can create is pretty cool. Better than some of the other games like it.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|So - I thought this would be real good.  Several times in the first half I thought about turning it off but the remote was too far away.  Then I just had to finish watching it.  Its pretty low budget but the story could be a good one for a more expensive movie.  If you really have nothing else to do and cant find another movie, give it a try, otherwise move along.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Different from the usual D.M.<br />I don't know if I like it yet but it is a must for a big Depeche Mode fan.
B001EN71CW|4.0|I spent most of this week watching the 14 episodes of Firefly for the second time in my life, and I think I appreciated it even more this time around. The TV show was cancelled before all of the Season 1 episodes were shown, although they ultimately aired on The Science Channel.<br /><br />The series failed for a number of reasons; the main one being that the episodes were not shown in the correct order, which was a stupid decision because the feature-length opening episode introduces all of the characters.<br /><br />So why do I like it?<br /><br />Firefly is a mix of action, drama, romance, and adventure. Although it's science fiction, the characters often talk like cowboys. Josh Whedon (Buffy, The Avengers) created the series, as well as directing three episodes and being involved as a writer.<br /><br />The characters have real depth, but the development isn't rushed. The origin of the relationships and character traits are explained gradually as the series progresses. Many of the characters are mysterious, and will make you question their true motivations. But, through it all, each character always seems real. You'll meet a married couple, war veterans, a preacher, a doctor, a psychologically damaged girl, a genius engineer, an apparently dumb mercenary, and a high-class prostitute. It's fascinating to see the existing bonds between some of the characters, and the development of new bonds.<br /><br />Episodes often show the crew taking on a task of some kind to earn their living. These assignments are often illegal, but can also become somewhat noble. If you are a fan of Whedon, you'll know that he uses humor regularly, and it's often present in Firefly. It can be pretty campy at times, but the writing is strong and it never comes across as stupid. Jaynestown is probably the funniest episode, and you'll understand why if you watch the episodes in the correct sequence.<br /><br />I would have to say that I like every character, and that's rare for me with a cast of this size. The biggest mystery in the series surrounds River (Summer Glau), who plays the sister of the ship's doctor, Simon (Sean Maher). Their relationship is arguably the strongest within the group, and there's always a sense that River's story drives the entire series.<br /><br />The Blu-ray includes all of the episodes, and the picture quality is good for the most part. Some of the darker images have lower quality, but the series is so good that you won't sit there criticizing the image. The special features include plenty of commentaries, as well as a making of feature, deleted scenes, and other assorted goodies.<br /><br />If you do become hooked on the series, you'll need to watch Serenity (2005), which was a two-hour movie wrapping up the main story. That's a fantastic science fiction movie, but you'll appreciate it more if you know the characters well. Firefly runs for almost 11 hours, and you'll end up wishing for more. The movie gives the show a proper ending, and won't leave you hanging.<br /><br />At the time of writing, it's available on Amazon.com for less than $20. Buy it if you like Whedon, science fiction, or well-written characters. Incidentally, the set is housed in a regular Blu-ray case with room for the three discs, so it won't look out of place on your shelf.of this size.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this app for my Kindle Fire.  Fun and addictive!  However, cannot easily use it on my phone, so I deleted it from there.  Play it almost every day on my fire, tho!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have been an avid fan of the Sookie Stackhouse novels with the exception of the last two novels.  The reason that I gave this book only two stars has nothing to do with who Sookie ends up with at the end of the book.  My complaint is that Ms. Harris did not give Sookie the care she deserved in ending this series.  This book felt rushed and the story line was incomplete to me.  When I am excited about a book, when it truly captures my attention I find it hard to put down. I put this book down several times because it was not an interesting read.  It seemed to me that Ms. Harris only wanted to end this series as quickly as possible, she had lost the passion that she showed for her characters in her early books. In my opinion this was a lackluster finish to an amazing series.  Sookie deserved better and so did her fans.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|great sound, easy to use, worth the download.  like the way my already purchased music is available.  use it daily.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Most watched show for everyone. Got this on Amazon Instant Video. Great investment. No regrets. Can watch it over and over.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Nice plot - lots of interesting characters - like a condensed Grisham story.... I am a fan! Set in Chicago and quite believable. Try it!

B000FC1HBY|5.0|I read this book before watching season 2 on HBO and it felt like it gave a little better background to the story. I love love love this series.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Okay so I looked all over for apps for editing picture and creating art and everything you had to buy or didn't have much.PicArt has all I needed and more plus you and upload it to different networks easy as a click of a button .

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Lincoln was great all around, but especially excelled in its writing, acting, and directing.  Watching this movie was time and money well spent.
193700788X|4.0|I just finished Dead Ever After...just after reading the pages and pages of scathing reviews here on Amazon.<br />With sadness, I read elsewhere on the web about people being so angry at Charlaine Harris that she feels frightened of her readers.<br /><br />I found DEA to be very much in keeping with the other 12 books.<br />I was happy that Ms Sookie ended up staying in her home town, and that she stood strong.<br />I LOVED the last line of the book. I teared up a little bit.<br />The story was interesting, it was a good read, and I enjoyed my glimpses of Quinn, Bill, Pam, Andy and Halleigh.<br />Sookie has great friends who stood by her when she needed them.<br />Good overall, I am happy.<br /><br />But...the story did seem to lack the emotional depth of the others, and went outside of Sookie's inner emotional life more than usual.<br />There were so many loose ends to wrap up that we didn't get to live inside of her thought processes the way we have gotten used to.<br />I missed that part of the story myself. I love Sookie's inner life.<br /><br />To close, why the heck are so many people mad that Sookie didn't end up with Eric? That I just don't get. especially after reading the<br />things revealed in this book.<br /><br />Overall, I am proud to own this book, and will be reading it again.<br /><br />Thank you Ms Harris.

0143039431|4.0|I give this book a 4 'cause of the bad language--it really interfered w/my enjoyment of it. A good novel once you got thru he first chapter.
B00C32REYI|5.0|James Blake does it again!!!!  I thought the self titled album was phenomenal, but Overgrown by far is simply Magnificent!!!  James Blake, with his melodically pronounced voice and sound inundates us into a trance throughout this album.  I have been looking forward to this album and out of the 10 songs there is only one that I occasionally skip.  Overall I believe this is only the start of the James Blake mania that will eventually triumph here in the U.S.  I only hope that we don't have to wait another 3 to 4 years for a follow up.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games is a well written book.  I don't usually care for science fiction, but this was good.  I enjoyed reading it and will probably read the others in the trilogy.
B000FA5STS|5.0|This was my first book using WhisperSync...both reading and listening to a novel. It was great as a medium. The plot was really complicated and difficult to anticipate. Excellent character development. A Real a joy to read with all the twists and turns. I read before I go to bed. I didn't want to go to sleep! G. Campbell, Illinois.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|The USB cable was a replacement for my original Kindle Fire cord.  My original cord cracked.  This one works, especially with the PowerFast for Accelerated Charging.  Arrived timely, priced well.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This book was a book that I first picked up to skim through for a book club I was in and ended up finishing it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down. A true autobiography of a poor Irish boy who was born in America to 2 very poor Irish immigrants who eventually went back to Ireland, had more poor Irish kids, divorced, were abandoned by their Father, and did what they had to to survive.  There was so much heartbreak, mixed with humor in a way only the Irish can do that I was laughing through the tears!! Loved it!!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|If you haven't seen The Big Bang Theory you are missing out.  The best comedy I have enjoyed since Will and Grace.<br />I hope this show goes on and on and on.  Love it!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was so good and at the end it was so suspenseful it kept you wondering are the orphans going to win are they not it was a rush.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a story you want to keep on reading. Well written, I didnt want it to end. We need more books like this, just a great story, Bravo Christina!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I could not put this one down.  Definitely one of my favorites so far.  I just started reading Grisham and have enjoyed his stories immensely..
B009VIZDLI|5.0|My daughter bought me this book after she purchased and read it herself. I have not been this heartbroken when a book ended for years. I tried to put it down, to read slower, to go out, but no, the end came, as it always does. It was such good fun, it was totally believable for those of us with \\"special\\" friends who have multiple quirks. I loved all the characterisations - Graeme has written them exactly how he wants to make you feel about them and it works. Keep guessing who Rosie's father is as you go along for the chaotic ride. Don is such a crack up, Rosie is delightful, the descriptions of Don's antics are hysterical. . . .  I love, love, love this book. If you watch The Big Bang Theory . . . behold: Sheldon.
B003B02O14|5.0|Grisham has a way of reeling you in to the story.  I enjoyed it very much.  It was a page turner,
0812993845|4.0|Although I don't much like the Shopaholic series, I have loved most of Kinsella's standalones so I was excited to pick this one up. Further adding to that was the knowledge that it featured sisters. Unfortunately my sister put a bit of a damper on my enthusiasm when she said she was not impressed with this book but I think she was being too hard on it as I had a lot of fun with it.<br /><br />I think a big part of your enjoyment will stem from whether or not you can tolerate someone meddling in the affairs of someone else. This often irks me but when I read about a sister thinking she knows what is best for her five years younger sister, I'm pretty sympathetic (guess how much younger my sister is than me?) And in this case, Fliss has some good reasons for being concerned for Lottie. After every breakup, Lottie has flung herself into some horrendous decisions but this latest is probably her worst: deciding to marry her gap year boyfriend who she hasn't seen in 15 years. Fliss interferes by attempting to prevent them from consummating their marriage so that they can get an annulment when they inevitably realize they are wrong for each other thereby avoiding the trauma of divorce which Fliss is presently undergoing. Needless to say some ludicrously hilarious things occur.<br /><br />My personal favorite moment is when Lottie and her new husband are on their honeymoon, attempting to cram for a Couples Quiz and he is incapable of answering such simple questions as \\"What is her favorite alcoholic drink?\\" However he can answer as if they were Dirk and Sally, the lead characters on their favorite TV show. When they decide to play as Dirk and Sally, the tide changes and they can answer any question perfectly. I have a soft spot for the Newlywed Game and this version of it made me so happy to imagine.<br /><br />A close second is how Lottie's ex-boyfriend Richard (the one who sends her spiraling into the arms of the old boyfriend) reappears in the story. He realizes he was wrong to have let Lottie go and is planning to fight for her. It's quite romantic although I'm not going to spoil any of the details (does he win Lottie back? No spoilers here!)<br /><br />Overall: Although this is not my favorite Kinsella book, I think fans will find plenty to love here. Suspension of disbelief has often been necessary for these kinds of books and this one is no exception. It's perfect for a light summery weekend beach read!ong to have let Lottie go and is planning to fight for her. It's quite romantic although I'm not going to spoil any of the details (does he win Lottie back? No spoilers here!)<br /><br />Overall: Although this is not my favorite Kinsella book, I think fans will find plenty to love here. Suspension of disbelief has often been necessary for these kinds of books and this one is no exception. It's perfect for a light summery weekend beach read!

0553582038|5.0|[SPOILERS]<br /><br />I was so excited to read this after the pulse-pounding second half of A Storm of Swords, which literally had me shouting as I was reading.  I wanted the story to move forward and I wanted to get to the payoff -- NOW!!!! -- from the dozens of threads in this saga.  My first reading of A Feast for Crows was a depressing slog.  All I had to say while I was reading was, \\"When is something going to happen?!\\"<br /><br />Fast forward a year.  After reading A Dance with Dragons, and then re-reading the whole series, the significance of this novel becomes clearer.  It gives us our first good look at Braavos, Dorne, and Oldtown.  It puts us inside Cersei's head to understand the snakepit of King's Landing and the folly of ruling by the sword and the lie, without wisdom or compassion or faith.  We get to know Brienne and learn (I think) that she is descended from Ser Duncan the Tall, and we see Jaime's continued transformation.  We discover (I think) that Sandor Clegane is still alive and is undergoing a transformation of his own.<br /><br />Great literature isn't about quick payoffs.  It's about richly developed characters facing richly developed dilemmas in a richly developed world.  That's A Feast for Crows to a tee.  Readers who want this story to hurry up and be done with probably won't care for it, and won't care for A Dance with Dragons either.  But for me, A Song of Ice and Fire is the best series I've ever read.  And I couldn't imagine the series without A Feast for Crows.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Intuitive, nice graphics and good sound.  It's not too difficult but not too simple. I haven't beat it yet as you have to rate the game before you can advance to chapter 3 but so far it's good!
B0098BFI7W|5.0|Great cast great movie with a screen play written by a local hero, Rod Sterling. With my sense of history, I felt that the President should have had more of Truman in him than say Carter.
B000P6PVLC|1.0|The movie is well acted, but the story is terrible! The cover says, \\"Brad Pitt's best film performance,\\" but that's an outright lie. His acting is fine, but far from his best, plus he's only in about 20 minutes of the movie anyway. None of the separate plot lines have any real resolution. The whole Japanese girl plot should be eliminated from the movie. The only reason it seems to be included at all is to give the director an excuse to show a troubled young woman go out of control and get naked with two grown men, one of which is her father. Also, the side plot of the Moroccan boy masturbating over his naked sister is totally uncalled for and adds nothing substantial to the film. It's just an exercise in depravity on the part of the director and writer.<br /><br />The movie is just bad! Save yourself from a terrible viewing experience and watch something else. Honestly, there's nothing worthwhile in this film.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Sorry but I don't like doing reviews. I will say that my wife and I enjoyed watching this series very much and find the production quality exceptional! I mainly wanted to watch it after finding out that one of the actresses was in a series produced years ago about the German army occupation of the British owned Channel Islands. Enjoyed both these series immensely.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really like this game. The only thing is that even with a stylus sometimes I cannot be precise enough.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Awesome game. Puzzle but not long. Great waiting room game. Love having two candies. One of my favorite games.  Advise this and all the others
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book starts out pretty slow. Nothing really excited me. I know the author had to set up the characters but at the same time i wish that part could of been shorter. It finally picks up, and picks up fast by the middle. I couldn't put it down! So many crazy things come to light, and fairly quickly. Up until the last page I was on the edge of my seat. Then it just ended. WHAT!? I wanted more, it cant just be over. Im trying not to give any details, so sorry if its vague. The slow beginning and defiantly the ending made this book an \\"ok\\" for me. Otherwise the middle/last couple pages is amazing. Defiantly a twister, read if you love those books!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Great charger, only one to deliver this kind of power to newer generation devices.  Powers my Note II with either jack.  Haven't tried my Nexus 7, but don't anticipate any issue, as it powers iPads as well.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|This was a typical Tom Cruise adrenaline pumping extravaganza. Other than MI 3, I felt this was the better of the series! Regardless of Cruise's belief system, he is a great actor & one that I look forward to seeing again & again. I can think of only a couple of his movies that I wouldn't care to view again & this is one worth multiple viewings. The action begins almost from the start & continues for most of the movie. I would definately recommend this one to anyone & any Cruise fan will be more than satisfied. This is one to view & also have in your library.
B006HL9G10|5.0|In just a few minutes I had it set up the way I wanted.  The sounds are lovely.  Simple and soft.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Honestly, I really only play it to help me fall asleep at night. It's fine, but it could be better made. It took me a while to figure out how to get past the ads. And frequently, especially when I have an empty slot, the pile of cards I am moving will end up not on the pile I'm trying to move it to, but the pile next to it. That's pretty annoying. But whatever, it's not like spider solitaire is a very exciting or involved game anyway. It's fine.
B009HNDCC4|4.0|This last year has not been as funny as the first three years that I watched Modern Family. Just okay.
B002O2THRO|2.0|This sounds like it should be great! It has an all star cast , but it's a very slow and disjointed film. I'm guessing the direction and editing is to blame since we know its a wonderful story. Plus the soft lens cinematography is distracting.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Another great Criuse film!  Great car chases with great \\"muscle cars\\" and the cinematography was well done. Main character, (Jack), was played well and believable for the most part.  And of course, Robert Duval is always good no matter what flick he is in. Overall, well worth the 2 plus hours of your time.
B0052VI2YS|5.0|it's easily understood that this is another one of rocks great releases so nothing more needs to be said about that. I will write about the sound of the SACD. I have read some reviews blasting this SACD release for being nothing more than a re-release of the 2001 DVD Audio and that may be so but my ears and system say that this is a fine release. I think the disc shines with snappy tight bass and a mid range that sounds authentic as a release this old can get. There is no harshness to the highs and detail is very good. I see no reason to hit this one below the belt. It is a great sounding SACD by one of rocks heavy weights.  The price is very reasonable and I recommend this SACD easily.
B001K3EXTA|3.0|Wanted to see a movie version after reading the novel - I<br />was intrigued to see how they could translate the book to film<br />as I felt the narrative and writing was what made the story so<br />remarkable and captivating.  Visually the settings, costuming, and<br />atmosphere pulled me right into the mood of the time but I felt<br />the movie was not a great translation of the book.  Always enjoy<br />seeing the young Redford, loved Lois Chiles' Jordan Baker.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Couldnt just put it down between reading chapters, thoughts always went with me.  It was 100% intriguingly spooky.  Highly recommended.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|The second I heard they were making a show based around Hannibal Lecter I immediately dismissed it as crap. I thought it was just another example of the lack of originality in the entertainment business.  I was wrong. This show is full of creativity and potential. I was hooked after the first episode and having watched the six that have aired to date, it has only gotten better. I like all of the various changes that have been made to the familiar characters and the show makes me think. A television show that makes me think seems to be a rare commodity of late and while I am sure they still make them, I sometimes have a hard time finding them. I am glad I found this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Man subway surfers is awesome. Subway surfers New York was ok but subway surfers Tokyo is just fantastic. I am getting Rome next.
B000059T00|3.0|An old one but still moves me!!  I believe it has some religious meanings in some songs, or should I say Karma meanings!! For those of you that remember this album you know what I mean!!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is a challenge my grandson loves it and I play it and know my reflexes aren't what they used to be so this will help me try to get some of it back.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|It's a melodrama , but its fun! Can 't wait for the latest season to hit Amazon Prime. Prime is a great deal.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|If your a game player you will like this game. It starts off slow but gets very addicting once you figure out how its played.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Intriguing right from the start. It has a bit of humor, the hero is believable, the story keeps you interested throughout. I really can't stand the thought of Tom Cruise, why does Hollywood keep giving this psycho work when there are millions of capable starving actors out there?  Maybe because of roles like this. If you ignore his real-life insanity he is capable of throwing down a good performance. On par with the Mission Impossible franchise.  I hope this becomes its own franchise. We need new original works rather than remade crap. Seriously, Hollywood remade Hansel and Gretel and Little Red Riding Hood for Christ's sake. Though I think Jack Reacher was originally a book. Meh, close enough.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts off easy enough but gets harder as you get up into the higher levels of the game definitely a game twister because it makes you think.
0812983459|4.0|For a concept so simple, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a rollercoaster of emotion. Harold, a bored retiree in an unhappy marriage receives a letter from an old friend, Queenie, and learns she is dying of cancer. He sets out to mail a letter back, but doesn't stop walking once he reaches the post box at the end of the street. He experiences that helplessness we all feel when presented with hopeless news from a loved one ... so he walks, because he has to do something .<br /><br />Most of the 300+ pages are with Harold during his walk and in his memories, with a few flashes to his wife who is not-so-patiently waiting at home (but also going through her own kind of journey). Early on and then several times throughout, Harold doubts his 600 mile journey. And as a reader, you lose hope as he does. But readers will also feel his successes just as purely. He's walking to keep Queenie alive, his first attempt at having faith, but as he walks he explores long lost, and often painful, memories of his past, while also absorbing the stories of those he meets along the way.<br /><br />\\"He understood that in walking to atone for the mistakes he had made, it was also his journey to accept the strangeness of others. As a passerby, he was in a place where everything, not only the land, was open. People would feel free to talk, and he was free to listen. To carry a little of them as he went.\\"<br /><br />This story proves that it truly is about the journey, not necessarily the destination.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is exciting yet calm at the same time. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Didn't think it would end the way it did.
B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|Like it, but makes me appreciate Angles more. Changes is awesome. Weird to use the falsetto at this stage. Lyrics in the sleeve would have been cool.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very interesting, but I didn't clear. I wasn't bit and I am fine. The shows really are suspenseful and you feel part of the family.
B0011MZOEI|2.0|Justin Long makes me want to kill myself is a pretty harsh statement, but.........<br /><br />This movie was a bit over the top. Olyphant was good. Don't get why the pilot would start shooting up s***in the city. Dumb.
0316236535|5.0|I bought this book to replace an earlier copy that was loved to death.  The new book is even better - it has eye holes in the cover! Thanks so much.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|She had me on the first page! When Laken and Will meet for the first time. I didn't know what Slam poetry was, it is like hearing someone's diary. Wow! Movie rights sold for this.
B008PHN6F6|5.0|Just one of the best movies ever made. From the story to the special effects. It is a ride from beginning to end. Makes you appreciate what you have.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is my favorite!  So intense but not explicit. You feel the torment and the happiness like it is your own!  I have recommended Colleen Hoover's books to everyone I know! I read about Colleen Hoover in our local Tyler, TX, paper about how she had self published and made to the New York Times bestseller list in less than a year. The characters are so real I can't turn the page fast enough. I like the conversation of the characters, you never get bogged down in wordy scenery descriptions!
0451232852|2.0|The only author capable of writing a worse politically/moral tinged novel than this one is Joyce Carol Oates. I expect more out of Follett. The basic tale is solid but his characters are flat, one dimensional and lack nuance. His Earl Fitzherbert is so obviously rotten, I could help envisioning him as Snidley Whiplash twirling his mustache as he prepares to deflower the innocent servant girl. Come on can we be more cliche? The same goes with his heroes Lady Maude and Billy Williams, they are much too good to be true. Really Ken go read some Steinbeck and see how it's suppose to be done.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Never thought a game on a mobile device could be so fun. I could vet lost in this game for hours!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought the book was a good use of my time and slow I was a violent book good book
B004LZFWJO|5.0|i have really enjoyed this game. i didn't think i would at first but it fooled me. i play it every day
B00BN3EE1O|1.0|READ the book! It is much better! I wish they would have followed the book a little more. Yet another book !
B003G4W49C|2.0|I had not read Sci-Fi for the past 20 years. I think Ender's game was visionary in 1985 (the nets, the desks the students use, which remind of the tablets we are using now) and this was really the best part of the book. But I am obviously old enough that I can remember how 1985 was, so I am not sure this is appealing for younger readers.<br /><br />The second best part to me was the description of the Battle Room, and I could understand why so many reviewers love the book, as I could \\"see\\" what was happening in there.<br /><br />Other than this, I found the characters shallow, and the assumptions behind the book disturbing: the ethical dimensions of using kids for war are barely hinted at and at the beginning of the book Col. Graff appears so naive that I wondered how he could ever have become the Battle School Administrator. I cannot help but wonder why so many teenagers find this book appealing...
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|its a hot when the cat talks back - the look on the children's faces are the best - it makes you laugh
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is just what I want! I am so happy I can see my trends and I can getnmore and more horses
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is very heart touching and emotional, which I love in a book. If you don't laugh or cry while reading a book then you just haven't found the right book yet. And I think I've found the right book. This book tells the story of two teenagers with cancer, but this is not a cancer book. The Fault in Our Stars has changed my perspective on a lot of things. It taught me to look at things a whole new way. My mother read this book in 24 hours, when normally she wouldn't come near a book. Even if you aren't a reader, you'll fall in love with this amazing piece of literature. John Green has an outstanding writing ability, which you will learn. I strongly recommend reading this and more of Green's works of art.  Warning: Be prepared to sob uncontrollably while reading this novel.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I loved this movie. I was a little worried after all the award season hype, but this movie proved to live up to all of it!! Just an all around feel good movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app every morning! It makes me solve math problems before it will shut off and I can choose the number and difficulty. There are a bunch of sounds to  choose from and there is even an option to have the sound gradually increase so it doesn't kill your ears in the morning. Theres also a timer function and it has NEVER EVER glitched. Plus it's free! Trust me, it's worth it!
B00633W614|4.0|I have enjoyed Jeffrey Archer's work before, so when I happened on the first book in this series (for 25 cents at the library sale), I read it immediately.  Then, of course, I had to get Book 2.  Now I'm waiting for Book 3 to become affordable.  I enjoyed the characters and the plot is absorbing.
B0097K21YW|1.0|what kind of sick person would buy let alone create a game that your goal is to &quot;spill doom over people&quot; or something like that I took one look at the pica and was scared to death
B00BWJARHO|5.0|It is a shame that this was not produced first.  I read LOTR first and then the Hobbit.  Should have been the other way around.  It was excellent seeing the same actors playing the roles they did in LOTR.  Cate gives you a much clearer insight into who she is portraying.  Even for an elf she carries her age of 10,000 years well and emits the power she controls.  Only at the end of LOTR did the three elfin rings come together.  A very powerful scene in Rivendale.  Looking forward to the continuing adventures.
B009R659L8|5.0|Fast read! Great book! Another page turner for this author! Each book that Mary Higgins Clark writes, gets better. She just doesn't turn them out quick enough for me!
B0084I9QFU|5.0|This is a two disc CD, and in my opinion....its the best.  My 5 yr old granddaughter loves Michael Jackson,so I purchased it 5thor her.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|MY gamer prefers the layout of his xbox controller, so we wee jazzed to find somebody got there first. NIce to not have to invent something.
B0082SU98U|4.0|The story was cute and the message was a good one. Wish I had read it as a younger person.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Fabulous book, wonderful program. I am one of those picky eaters that make following conventional diets impossible & to be able to eat all the things I love is super. I find that keeping busy keeps me from eating when I don't need to, and the calorie restricted days are not that hard to get through. I have already lost an inch off my waist. Michael Mosley is a wonderful talent & I also love his programs on public tv.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love it! It's awesome I love mystery games!  It's really fun when I got it I was like come on come on come on load all ready I want to play this.
B0055S348W|1.0|Just doesn't work with my HP printer.  A total waste of money and time.  You should be able to see a list of supported products before purchase.  I don't recommend this unless you are sure your product is supported.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Especially if you are travelling. As long as you can get a wifi connection then you can get the weather for your area and the area you are travelling to before leaving your hotel room. All without having to find the weather channel on the hotel television. Quick and easy.
B000BNTM96|5.0|Queens of The Stone Age kick ass and this CD is a perfect example of their ass-kicking awesomeness. Live rock at its best.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Besides just playing the game there are goals and achievements that you complete as you complete each board in shorter times. I recommend it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I have loved every Mitch album book, so I'm always ready to read another. This was a fast read, engaging and gets you thinking about important things.
160941280X|1.0|I just couldn't listen to the last CD.  The author read this book himself, and his voice has no emotion in it at all.  It's incredibly difficult to listen to.  Not only that, but it did not offer tips for improving business as I'd hoped it would.  I made it to the last CD, but I just could not listen to one more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would like for there to be a girl character on it, and I  would like for the he to automatically update itself. Other than the game is totally DOUBLEY AWESOME
B008X5CMCS|4.0|Follows the grail legend well, and for the time the effects where well shot. The actors due a wonderful job
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I like it, it's clear and easy to use and does what it's supposed to do.  It suits me just fine.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Reading  stills the mind from the pressures of everyday life. When a book comes along that allows you to &#34;Escape&#34; , that's 5 star  writing. Excellent Morgan Rice. Thank you.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Makes note-taking easy and clear.  I have not had a chance to use all the available ways to use it, but I will get there as the need arises.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I Thought Angry Birds Friends Was Fantastic! It Demonstrated How To Play Very Clearly, In A Way Everyone Could Understand.<br />Angry Birds Friends Reminded Me Of A Game My Son And I Used To Play. I Don't Remember The Name Off-Hand, But It Was Sort Of Similar To Angry Birds, In That You Had To Shoot At Things, And Get As Many And You Could To Score.<br />I Haven't Played Angry Birds Friends For Very Long, But I've Completed The First Five Scenes With Excellent 3 Star Scores; Which Is The Highest Scores You Can Get!<br />It Met My Expectations Of The Game! It Was Everything I Expected It To Be!
B006M3JVD6|5.0|When I first heard about Jaycee's ordeal in the media, I was so traumatised by it that I could hardly sleep for a week.  I was terribly disturbed by what happened to her and by the kind of evil that exists in the world that allowed it to happen.  I thought long and hard about reading her book, fully expecting to be spending another sleepless week unable to process the hideousness of it all.  And make no mistake, what happened to her is still incomprehensible.  But she somehow manages to relate this story in a way that is not so dramatic as it is human.  I found that she calmly provided the answers to the questions that most people must have had, and mostly we were probably wondering what her every day life must have been like.  I was hugely relieved to read that the rape eventually stopped.  I found some comfort in the fact that she had her children with her and she also had the love and companionship of her animals.  But most of all, I found so much comfort in the fact that she is clearly a strong, courageous woman (much more than she realises) and that she definitely seems to have it in her to overcome this horror.  Her spirit never broke.<br /><br />I'm glad I read it, and I'm grateful that she wrote it.  It's honestly the worst thing that I can ever imagine happening to someone, but she shared it in a way that left me more hopeful than horrified.<br /><br />I wish her so much strength going forward with her life, and that she will find the clarity she needs to put it all behind her.  She certainly seems to have been born with the innate wisdom it will take to find it.
B003DCPGNS|5.0|A great old film!! A must see for those who appreciate cinema. Newer movies coul lesrn something from the likes of this movie.
B007THA4FI|2.0|What a let down.  So difficult to read and understand for someone from the States.  The terms used were totally unfamiliar to me.  I am an avid reader and the value of this book remains a mystery.
B0011MVVHM|5.0|This book changes my perspective on how I viewed heaven. Also how I viewed everyone who is in my life because they are in my life to either help me on my journey or for me to help on theirs. I will never fear death again and look forward to the day I will be reunited with my Lord and God.
B00466HNHM|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over again. Love Whitney Houston and of course Kevin Costner. Haven't gotten tired of watching it yet
014241493X|5.0|Another wonderful John Green book...simply beautiful. Twists and turns and credible characters with heartwarming relationships. It's a must read book.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Perfect Christmas CD. Love her voice and the songs were awsome. A favorite on mine during the holidays. Listened to it constantly in my car and at home
B00064WSN2|5.0|I see very mixed reviews for this album; some people say that this is a clone of Crimson's first album, while others say it's not too good musically, and there are even people who say that it's not good because of turnover (3 members leaving). Well, I certainly can't knock an album just because some key people left; there are other talented musicians out there. Yes, there are parallels in sound to their first album, but so what!!! In fact, this album has some very nice acoustic guitar. Oh, and the track, CAT FOOD.........is someone going to say that it's similar to anything on their first album? I think not, or at least I hope not. This album has the signature mellotron anchoring it, and the title track is a haunting yet very relaxing song that never gets old. This album is just about in the class of In The Court Of The Crimson King, Red, Starless And Bible Black, and Larks' Tongues In Aspic, and has its great moments, and should be in every fan's collection. Also check out the song CADENCE AND CASCADE, which features a different vocalist. I give this album a solid 4.5 stars. Enjoy!!!
B009G78EE2|5.0|There is not a word to describe how absolutely perfect this album is. I liked the two songs that were out on the radio but when Same Love came out I had to buy this. I'm an old school Hip Hop head and have been annoyed with what some people are calling music these days. This album smashes anything around it and has heisted the Hip Hop game. I haven't felt compelled to buy an album in years but Macklemore's lyrical genius combined with Ryan Lewis's mind blowing beats makes this album one that I haven't been able to stop playing since the day I bought it. Every song is dope, every song makes you think. This album has definitely made me a fan.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|ONE FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO REVISIT THE PAST AND REMEMBER HOW IT WAS BACK THAN ONE FOR THE PUREISTS AMONG US.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I started watching this because my co-worker said it was a great show.<br />Not until I was watching it, by the end of this season I was addicted to it.<br />Great show.

B009M06JO0|4.0|What else needs said?<br />It's not Reign In Blood but it's still very very good.<br />I've been listening to slayer a lot lately with Jeff's passing RIP.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I saw this movie 3 times in the theater, and now it is in my DVD player and plays as I go to sleep.  If I am not tired enough, I can watch up to an hour before I actually go to sleep.  Love every minute of it!
B00571F26Y|4.0|The book made a lot of sense. However, given how our tastes have adapted over the years, the requriement to leave all wheat-based products out of your diet seems quite extreme. Completely eliminating foods is harder than the book lets on.
B008Q00BOQ|2.0|WEAK PLOTT, PURE CORN.  I watched it for 30  minutes and gave up on it.  Definitely one of his worst.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I loved this movie.  Very informative but very scary to think this is how our food supply is managed. I highly recommend this movie and hope it will help move more people to action. Whether it be politically or just being more mindful as they shop for food for their families. I must see IMHO.
B000002H4C|5.0|i seen this movie when i was 16 in 1981 loved then love it now the secound one is great too wish they would make a 3rd
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Slow while establishing, but gained momentum and became a great page turner<br />Looking forward to the next book of Michael Connelly
B002RI9HUM|5.0|I love love loved this book.  It was engaging, interesting and entertaining!<br />It raised questions about people perception of addiction and for me this struck a particular chord. Marian really got into the head of Rachel and allowed us to understand her - when she left the clinic and what ensued broke my heart and I knew then who engaged I was in Rachel's story.  I wanted her to win!<br />For me this is the best Marian book so far although I do love them all!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The book has a lot more meaning than this topical movie. However it is ok to enjoy for an afternoon movie.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I bought this DVD for my mom as a gift. I went to Barnes and Nobles, Best Buy, etc, but this was by far the best price. It arrived promptly and the case looked great, even better than the ones at the stores I mentioned. Definetly recommend buying it from here.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Didn't think I'd care for these books much at first but then couldn't put them down. Great read! Highly recommended for all.
B000SEGSB8|5.0|I felt enlightened after reading this history story, not your usual boring history textbook book. I regret the fact that I didn't read this book 10 years earlier. It would have changed my opinion on the reasons of European attitudes. The book is based on rich content source, through research and quite balanced observations. It was an easy read for me on my kindle. I realized that it was 20000+ kindle pages only after I finished the book..
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This wasn't what I thought I was getting...but my nine year old Loved it...but my 10 month old twins weren't as interested in the game..I thougt it was going to be a movie they could watch...but they were too young for the game.
B009R659L8|5.0|This is another excellent book by the Mystery Queen, Mary Higgins Clark.  As always, her writing style flows from page to page, chapter to chapter.  Her descriptive writing allows the reader to become familiar with each character.  Her books carry sub-plots that<br />at the right time, tie everything together.  Anyone who loves a good mystery should, by all means, purchase this book.  You will not be disappointed.
0316228532|1.0|As big a fan as I am of J K Rowling's Harry Potter books, I hate to say how much I did not enjoy \\"Casual Vacancy.\\"  I knew it was written for adults, not children, but adults were some of the Harry Potter series' biggest fans, so I didn't know how different this book would be.  \\"Casual Vacancy\\" just made me miss the Harry Potter characters more.  I quit this book in the middle, which is something that I never do.  \\"Casual Vacancy\\"  was just a disappointment, so depressing an attempt to seem to be clever.  I'm sorry that I bought this book.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Every bit as good as the first two books of this trilogy. I stayed up far too late many nights because I was caught up in the story and couldn't stop reading.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This was a fabulous series, if you like Spartacus, you'll really enjoy this season. I really enjoyed watching all 4 seasons
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is acute game. It fun and easy to play. The ability to collect pearls without having to buy them is great.
B0098460O4|5.0|wonderful .  will stay in my vehicle for a long time.  everyone should hear these remarkable young people  hope they tour the usa
B00008H2LB|4.0|It's just what I expected. Same sound I love to hear play in my ears. Linkin Park music is as if they're vibing to me.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Game was ok just like all the rest no real challenge because its head to head now. I wouldn't recommend anyone get this unless you've never played angry birds.  It's dull and the same like all old angry birds games.  Boo.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Loved this movie, the acting was great and the story line was well written.  I certainly would recommend for everyone.
1476734941|4.0|Like this book very much.  It has great tips and a lot of motivational stories.  very helpful in calorie counting and great ideas as far as menus.  Would recommend.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|ENJOY THE MUSIC FROM SOMEONE I HAD NOT HEARD OF. IM A FAN NOW FOR SURE. EVERYONE AROUND ME HAS HEARD IT<br />PLAYING SO MUCH THEY KNOW THE WORDS....
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|i recommend you getting this game if you are a Iron Man fan. there is a lot of flying but it is addicting.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|A great CD if you liked the movie.  Well put together and overall I enjoy listening to it from one end to the other.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so majestic I love it good job 10/10 I fricken love mlp it is my childhood and more it was all that was good in my life a  I grew up because I was raise  by ocelots and did I mention that I'm doctor doofenshmirtz
B0006J28MI|5.0|not an academy award winner but a entertaining family movie on a saturday night. A fun movie for all ages.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I can not wait to see the sequels to this series. Bilbo was really a great character in the movie. Lots of action, from a lot of different characters. Nice scenery in some parts like the land of the elves.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I think this is my third or fourth Murakami novel and I just can't stop willing to read more and more of his stories. He's created such unexpected worlds where fiction is so elegantly intertwined with reality that it keeps you in your tip toes all along. 1Q84 is an extremely well written novel with the right touch of insanity. You will end up wondering if you aren't living in your own 1Q84.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Some of the puzzles were fun, but I liked other angry birds more than this one. But it was the free one, so I can not complain to much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing, its so addicting, i love it,every time you lose, u will wanna play again,  this game is amazing.
B00CHILW64|5.0|I can remember seeing the wall of water that over took the Island on TV. I could not imagine going through what the family went through. I am so glad that the family was all united in the end. The film crew did a great job at making the movie look so realistic.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really liked the game slot. There was  Times when I could not figure out what to do next, but I kept at it and got threw the game without losing my mind. Great job. Bring on the next one.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is one of my favorite games of angry birds. Went through the different levels, now I go  back and try to get a better score.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is really good but can't get friends!!!some one should friend me I am xxxwyatt,but this app more than worth it! Love the faces
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever I can't put it down I play it after school and my high score rocks
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have really enjoyed facebook,i love.it more than anything so for!!!! I have talked to all my friends and relatiives  I have not seen or talked to in years!!!
193700788X|4.0|I thought this book was a fitting end to the series. I have no idea what book all the people who gave this book 1 star were reading. Sookie ended up with the right person for her -- the person I've been rooting for since the beginning. The short story in the Sookie companion really set this up nicely. Maybe I'm in the minority since I really don't like vampire romances -- vampires are DEAD and to get a HEA they have to kill their loved one. How is that romantic? Sookie remained true to her character and didn't go all Bella Swann on us. Is that what people have a problem with? She was supposed to die?<br /><br />Eric revealed himself to be the douchebag I always knew he was. He had a few moments in Dead to the World when I almost liked him, but everything Charlaine Harris has ever written about him led us right to this moment. Why are people surprised? I agree this series went on too long, but blame the publisher not Harris. She's wanted to write something else for awhile now, but book sales demanded more Sookie. Maybe I see things differently because I attended a book signing last year where I heard the author discuss her vision for the characters. She was very clear on her opinion of vampires in general. Kudos to Charlaine for writing her own book and not the one the fans felt they deserved.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I have really enjoyed vevo!! I love watching the videos and listening to the latest songs!!plus  I did,nt. Lke country before, now i do!!!! Thanks!!!

B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|Very. Informative!!!so for so good!! I was able to get news before it was on national news on t.v. plus it gave more depth to the information
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|WE ordered this because we discovered we didn't have Willow on DVD, and I was happy to get it on both Blu Ray and DVD together.  We watched it with the kids right after it arrived, 4 & 7.  They both enjoyed it and it kept their attention. We had no troubles with the disc and the movie looked great.

1449437524|2.0|Read The Oatmeal all the time, have the other two books and have greatly enjoyed them.  While I love the comic that is this book, that is all it is.  I was expecting something like the first two books.  Don't mind supporting a web site that I frequent regularly just wish that the book had more content, even at around half price I don't believe I would have made this purchase knowing what I got.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|I have invested a small fortune in CD's over the past 25 years, so I had no need to download MP3 files. I would simply rip only the best songs from my CD collection to be transferred to the Ipod in my car. Back when I had dial-up internet, I actually downloaded a few MP3 songs, which took 20 minutes each. I went back to purchasing CD's after that. Now that I have super high speed interenet at home, I figured that I could easily download the 2-3 good songs from an album instead of buying the whole CD. No way, thanks to something called the Cloud Player. Let me get this straight! If I purchase MP3 songs from Amazon, I am not even allowed to keep them on the hard drive of my desk top PC, which I now also use as a home juke box fed into my home stereo system. It now also seems like everyone assumes that everyone else has a smart phone and listens to music through ear buds. Well I DON'T! I listen to all of my MP3 files through 240 watts in my car or at home. I could not even find a way to contact Amazon to see if I am wrong, but from reading all of these negative reviews, it appears to be worse. Big Brother has now found a way to know your every move so all kinds of crap can be advertised to you without invitation. It looks like when CD's quit being made, my music buying days are over with. By the way, I have never had to download anything on iTunes, and it appears that they also have similar restrictions, but not quite as bad. Can anyone correct me if I am wrong?

B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is what life was like years ago I'm sure with added drama it is on tv. Interesting characters with an interesting story line. What will happen in-between two brothers, will he destroy his wife's love for him and will he get the respect of his son back. How will the family function after the death of one of them. The priest brought to this strange unchristen land and trusted like family what will he do in this savage land? Watch and find out and so will I. This series is not for those week of heart with violence and blood.
1451695195|5.0|The author has an amazing way of describing his experience and also putting the medical terms in such a way as we can understand them.  I just want to recommend this book to everyone who believes in Heaven.  As a friend of mine determined,  God is Love.
B00A8P45FI|5.0|First, I saw this movie when it first ran with my father.  I was quite surprised that he wanted to see it.  He also took me to see Bullitt, a McQueen classic, so I suppose he liked McQueen.  Or perhaps it was because Dad, who was imprisoned by the Japanese in WWII, understood brutality and the desire for freedom, and wanted to impress this on me.  Anyway, that is one of the reasons I like this movie.<br /><br />Certainly, the extreme brutality of the French Guiana prison system does not contribute much to an enjoyable or fun filled viewing experience.  Instead it provides the vehicle for great actors to show that the human spirit can be indomitable, especially when love is in the heart.  The contrast between Steve McQueen's character, Henri Charriere or Papillon (Butterfly), and Dustin Hoffman's character, Louis Degas, as they survive the extreme rigors is a great part of the art of this movie.<br /><br />For Papillon, it is the love of freedom that drives him, the great reward worth very great risk. The love of true friendship is not far behind and causes considerable conflict in his mind.  How many of us would willing choose to honor friendship over torture, half rations, solitary confinement in darkness and our very survival?  Do I have a friendship worth eating cockroaches to keep?<br /><br />Although this movie is based upon the real story of Henri Charriere, that really isn't relevant to enjoying the movie.  The keys for me are the wonderful performances of Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman who are supported by marvelous character acting, fine directing, excellent cinematography, stunning locations, and an engrossing story.  That the average viewer rates this as four stars must be due to the brutality, and that solitary confinement is necessarily slow.  Perhaps, in this age of vivid cinematic brutality, it is that this movie is remarkably restrained and understated.  It is the very understated last seconds of the film that permit me to rise from viewing it withgreat satisfaction, so don't quit early.
B009NY43NY|1.0|From the dedication: \\"There isn't a way I could make all of you happy with the ending of the series, so I've followed my own plan, the one I've had all along..\\"<br /><br />I think the key word here is that she had a plan all along and wouldn't be dissuaded even when her creation may have taken her in a different direction.<br /><br />I won't include spoilers. Instead, it felt forced and unconvincing. Thank you to Charlaine for creating this world. However, it was poor writing to conclude it. Like a really bad sequel.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|If you are unable to imagine a world and experience it first hand as you read a great Novell, perhaps you can appreciate it if it is carefully recreated in film.  Well, actually only the first third of it is released so far...<br /><br />I was tempted to wait for all three parts of this before I watched it.  After all, I read the hobbit in less than a week first time, so many years ago.  There were not any places I wanted to put the book down.  Later, I enjoyed reading this book out loud several times, a chapter at a sitting.  No one wanted to wait more than a day for the next reading.  Having watched this first part, I am finding waiting a year for the second part a little disconcerting, even though I thoroughly know the story.  I did not feel this way for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br /><br />I suppose this means that the movie is good as a movie, not just the most accurate recasting of a fantasy book into a movie that I have experienced.  I look forward to the next film if only to see that they did the next segment well or poorly.<br /><br />The bonus materials, which I believe are all weblogs created during the filming are interesting, showing locations and the marvelous sets they created,  But watching this as a single stream is rather long.  It would be nice if Amazon split it into episodes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun and easilly addictive...I enjoy it as much as my grandkids do. Highly recommend this one  tohelp pass time..
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Well, this one surprised me, so I gave it four stars.  I expected one more time-travel flick, which this almost is, but it does have a good twist, and worth watching if you are a thoughtful person.  If you are not, I would avoid this.  Were it not for the thoughtful twist, I would have given this two stars for poor story and excessive violence unnecessary to telling the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing if i could play it all day i would .....this game is great anyone and everyone should play its fun and challenging
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington, certainly one of my top ten actors, plays this part spot on.  It is a very difficult story.  You want him to be an unsullied hero, but his behavior, his speeding away from reality and truth, is so much the human tragedy, and certainly a central characteristic of our age.<br /><br />But do we see how we, as a people, avoid reality and truth?  Virtual reality doesn't just happen in video games, movies, and drugged highs.  Can we handle reality?  Can we handle the truth?  Would we know what it is when it is biting our butts?  Well it is biting us, and we don't seem to know we must turn around and embrace it, for that is where true freedom is found.<br /><br />The acting is excellent on all parts, but especially Don Cheadle and John Goodman.  Goodman, on target in his part as the drug pushing &#34;expert&#34;, makes me wonder at his experience.<br /><br />Folks, if you shy away from this movie, you probably need to see it and consider it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is actually a decent dramatic comedy. I would recommend it to anyone who likes comedies with a sad tone but has a happy ending.

B001N3GUIE|4.0|Watched this movie knowing nothing about it going in; part of my recent 1950's sci-fi kick.<br /><br />In this movie we follow a group of astronauts from the United Planets as they travel to distant planet Altair IV to do an evaluation on a scientist colony founded 20 years earlier.  It's notable that there are many distinguishing factors to this movie:  The spaceship is completely manmade, you never see 1 inch of Earth or anywhere from our native solar system, and there is no musical score.  In place of a traditional score, there is \\"Electronic Tonality\\" setting the scene.  I found this to mold perfectly with the atmosphere of the movie.<br /><br />Playing Commander John J. Adams is Leslie Nielson.  Born in the late 70's, I grew up only knowing Nielson from roles in movies like the \\"Naked Gun\\" trilogy, \\"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\\", and similar spoofs. While the subject matter of this movie isn't quite as dire or all-encompassing as \\"When Worlds Collide\\", it was fascinating to see Leslie Nielson in this role, as he pulls it of famously.<br /><br />Opposite Nielson is Anne Francis' Altaira, the daughter of one of the colonizing scientists.  What we have here is the weakest link of the movie, albeit not necessarily at the hand of Ms. Francis. While understandable that since she was born on Altair IV, and therefore has never been around a shipload of real \\"Earthmen\\", AND accepting that this shipload of dudes have been in space for 378 days, the movie focuses a little too heavily on her dressing and more so acting like a sleaze.<br /><br />A third main character that must be paid attention:  Robby the Robot.  While still rigid like many sci-fi robots, Robby is much more mobile than expected and has a personality that refuses to be pure-camp and greatly adds to the overall feel and mood of the movie.<br /><br />The costumes/wardrobe is above average in quality and design, but the environments are the real catcher.  Excellent attention to detail in all locales and props, from the main spacecraft to a tractor to a sprawling, 280-floor megalopolis; fantastic use of all colors your retinas can handle; truly cutting edge special effects can be especially dazzling at times (the trouble at the perimeter scene), yet they all have a place in the film; none are used as just diluting extras.  The one glaring boo-boo I saw was sometimes when firing their purple-ray-shooting guns, the cosmonauts aren't even bothering to squeeze the trigger or push a button to activate them.  The techno-babble segments are informative, yet never drone their way to boredom.  Being a devout Trekkie I LOVE my technobabble, but this movie certainly could have crossed a line, but certainly does not.<br /><br />All put together, \\"Forbidden Planet\\" delivers a solid sci-fi experience that should be watched by any fan of the genre.  The information reveals and action sequences pace the movie wonderfully, with an ultimate revelation that is first-rate and thought-provoking.  Be sure to drop in and see the wonders of the Forbidden Planet!from the main spacecraft to a tractor to a sprawling, 280-floor megalopolis; fantastic use of all colors your retinas can handle; truly cutting edge special effects can be especially dazzling at times (the trouble at the perimeter scene), yet they all have a place in the film; none are used as just diluting extras.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|A lush and contemplative masterwork from Kate Bush, the modern mistress of aural impressionism.<br /><br />It is no fluke that Kate is one of the most influential living musicians in the English-speaking world. . . as a true progressive artist, she never ceases to explore new territory, yet she also has the ability to tap into moods and feelings that are so universal as to even touch and win over the dedicated top-40 herd, every once in awhile. Since \\"Never for Ever\\", not one of her releases has sounded like any others, and this album is no exception.<br /><br />As with all of Kate's albums, there are a couple of pieces I could live without, and many that I find absolutely amazing.  And as usual, the entirety of it grows on you, with every listen.<br /><br />The disc is packaged in a beautiful and clever cd-sized hardcover booklet, reminiscent of a children's book, including a complete libretto and credits listing.  In addition to the usual bevy of excellent musicians, the album features percussion by the celebrated studio veteran Steve Gadd, and a cameo vocal performance from Elton John.<br /><br />The only real quibble I have with it has nothing to do with Kate or the music, but rather the hard cardboard \\"eco sleeve\\" that seems to be all the rage with distributors, these days (it is not packaged in a \\"digipack\\", as some sellers have claimed!) Of course, they'd have you believe that it's used in order to be \\"green\\".  But the real reason is to save on packaging costs, since they apparently assume that today's consumers will tolerate just about anything if it's marketed well enough.<br /><br />Anyway, this type of sleeve makes it virtually impossible to remove a cd without some minor scratching/dinks on the playing surface, and a finger smudge or two on the leading edge, no matter how careful your touch. For this reason, you should be VERY suspicious of any listing of this title that calls itself \\"Like New\\".  It's either going to be Brand New (and sealed), or Very Good (at best).<br /><br />Meanwhile, pop the disc into your player, sit back with a cup of warm tea, and revel in the latest delightful world of Kate's design.

B000LJAEFG|4.0|This is one of the better Sci-Fi flix from the 80's and is well worth watching, for any fan of \\"thinking\\" sci-fi (as opposed to the basic cleavage-and-laser bug fests).  It's also somewhat notorious, since Natalie Wood died in 1981 before shooting was completed. This put the film's production in limbo for over two years. Some rewriting, and voice & body doubles were required to eventually complete the film, in 1983.<br /><br />It's generally well-acted and directed, with good (for the 80's) special effects, and a great symphonic music score by the well-known film composer James Horner. It's one of Christopher Walken's better movies, and boasts what just might be Louise Fletcher's best performance ever (She won a Saturn Award for it). Cliff Robertson is also noteworthy, as their government-stooge boss.  Natalie was also posthumously nominated by the Saturn committee-- as best \\"supporting actress\\", presumably to avoid direct competition with Louise.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert** plot and ending are discussed ahead. . . .<br /><br />The central concept is quite fascinating, although the plot does get somewhat predictable and implausible toward the end-- especially regarding the all-too-easy \\"foiling the bad guys remotely\\" sequence near the climax.<br /><br />Most of the criticism I've read about this flick, however, revolves around the apparent lack of romantic chemistry between Walken and Wood. . . a somewhat valid point, though one needs to remember that as the story begins, their characters have just *recently divorced* and are still in the process of selling their house.  Not exactly a situation that would lead one to expect sexy pheromones popping out of the screen.  One might guess that some of the extensive post-production re-writes and re-editing forced by the studio (and Natalie's death) may well have clipped the scenes which made their eventual reconciliation more believable. . . especially since it occurs at about the same time the film's action is getting more exciting.<br /><br />The actual brainscan-replay scenes were filmed in wider resolution than the rest of the film, and were a real cinematic thrill for the time.  Really great to see on a LARGE screen.  And that final death-experience-replay sequence is one of the most conceptual and inspired scenes ever filmed.  It manages to be imaginative, beautiful, spiritual, and uplifting, and yet threatens nobody's religious or agnostic viewpoints (at least the non-myopic ones, anyway). And it also slips in a wee bit of quantum physics speculation, as well.<br /><br />My only real quibble with this film is the idea that these two brilliant people (as they're portrayed) wouldn't have figured out some way to just copy or steal the precious death-sequence tape. . . in order to watch it at their leisure, in hiding, rather than risking discovery and interference by all those nasty government/corporate drones.  And also, of course, there's the silly concept that such an immense amount of audio/video/sensory data could ever be sent over a simple phone line/modem connection, in real-time. . . ah, but well, that's the geek in me, talking.<br /><br />The flick is really quite entertaining.  And it makes you wish that Natalie had lived to make more movies.

B00005V9IL|4.0|Cameron does Spielberg, with a dose of \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\"... AKA: \\"Close Encounters, under 2 miles of ocean\\".  Spielberg-like effects, plot-line, and uplifting ending... perfect for family viewing (assuming you don't mind some of the anti-military subtext.)  I don't think Cameron could have done a more effective homage to Spielberg's style if he'd wanted to.<br /><br />A very big-budget, grandiose hollywood epic, with pretty decent acting (Ed Harris is particularly good, as usual), a typically implausible plot-line, the expected zip-zow special effects, clichés aplenty, and a basically sappy premise.<br /><br />Having said all that-- I think it's a perfectly WONDERFUL flick, head and shoulders above the standard \\"blast the bugs\\" crap that passes for sci-fi, these days.  It's the kind of movie that we've always wanted to 'go to the movies' for.<br /><br />It keeps you more than entertained enough to get you through its 2-1/2 to 3 hour length (depending on the version). The sheer effort required to make an epic of this nature is impressive enough, but the syrupy story is actually pretty compelling, as well.  Less-than-subtle references to the paranoid and violent sides of human nature are, unfortunately, as accurate as ever... and therefore no less valid for being used so often.  And the hopeful, uplifting ending should be enough to touch any but the most cynical of viewers.<br /><br />The plot does make a LOT more sense in the longer \\"special edition\\" (i.e. director's cut), where much footage that was removed in the initial release (due to intrusive studio executives), was restored.  The concerns and intent of the \\"ET's\\" are much more obvious, and therefore more plausible.  This is the version to get.<br /><br />Suspend your skepticism, round up the kids, break out the popcorn, and sit down for a fascinating adventure.  Then go back to your boring job, and wish that the world was a more fair and magical place....

B008LVCKH6|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who's judgement I value. I loved the story! The narrative takes so many interesting turns you will end up laughing out loud. The premise is absolutely outlandish yet at the same time plausible. Wonderful book to relax with.
0062086529|5.0|I bought this for my 2yr old granddaughter.  She enjoys having books read to her and she really likes this one.  We read this several times a night when she's visiting.  Very cute book and I like the simple illustrations which really seem to appeal to my granddaughter as well. A simple story, simply written, with a lot of imagination. Highly recommend.
B001EBWING|5.0|&#34;Casablanca&#34; remains among the most highly regarded of all American films, emerging from an era (1942) when American films had yet no strong foreign competition.  Many aspects of this film remain astonishing: casting and acting, screenplay (based on a stage play), directing, black & white cinematography, almost everything about it.<br />  I find only one real fault in &#34;Casablanca.&#34;  Characterization of the Nazi partisans is too stark, almost melodramatic.  Not too much for war-time, perhaps, but a little over-the-top in our cynical era.  That's a very small thing, though, to hold up against the splendors that are offered here.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I bought this for my 2yr old granddaughter.  She watches this movie over and over and over!  It's very clever and original and find myself stopping what I'm doing to watch it with her!  Very entertaining for the little ones.
B008L1F91A|5.0|This statue is fantastic! The colors are incredibly vibrant and the detail is excellent! I have one for my desk at home and will be ordering another for my desk at work very soon.
B00000JRTX|5.0|This is a very entertaining move, good humor, lots of laughs.  Always been fan of Hugh Grant and British humor and this movie is must have.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|The story of Joseph (&#34;John&#34;) Merrick - a severely deformed man who lived in Victorian England, and his relationship with the doctor who rescued him from degrading living conditions. The movie is filmed in black and white - which adds a great deal to the atmosphere. Hopkins performance is incredible - showing a man who overcomes his own voyeurism and who redeems himself through his heart-felt concern for Merrick. Hurt is equally brilliant as Merrick - and through him we see a gentle soul who, despite a long and painful history eventually blossoms.
B003629IPW|5.0|A brilliant montage of the making of a show. Anyone who loved Michael's music and<br />performances will be blown away. I especially enjoyed watching Michael contribute to the way the songs and choreography were intertwined....a master at work!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|New to the fantasy genre, I loved this book. It was a great introduction to books containing different worlds and creatures. It is an easy read so I could read it anywhere; in bed, at lunch, etc. I couldn't put it down!
0452289963|5.0|Another spectacular work by Eckhart....his best yet. If you are interested in shifting your perspective of life, this body of work is your guidepost. I couldn't put it down! Read it cover to cover in 1 sitting! You will too!
B0085A9HXS|4.0|Guy gets trapped in a building, bad guys try to kill him. &#34;Die hard,&#34; right? Well, yeah, but as classic as &#34;Die hard&#34; is, it doesn't have the kinetic energy of &#34;The Raid: Redemption.&#34; The character development helps sustain the one note plot; the action is so fierce you'll forget the one note plot and love the movie. Not to be confused with &#34;Dredd 3D,&#34; a comic book movie with a similar plot.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator all the time! It has large buttons and let's you use the answer to a previous problem in future calculations.

B0091REZMW|3.0|As most games, there is the buy to get ahead option but overall that hasn't affect me. Graphics are nice as well.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I was looking forward to getting the CD in mp3 format but since it came free with the actual CD it was a real deal. It took a couple listens all the way through to really get into the new sound but I'm definitely happy with it. Looking forward to seeing them in concert this month in Atlanta!

0988936402|5.0|One of the best science fiction/ fantasy books I have ever read. The book is for young adult age. However, highly recommend everyone to read
B003EYVXTG|5.0|The culture is familiar, but the heroine stands out. She insists that some values must be upheld, even for those who reject society's laws. The language is vivid, and memorable.
1451648537|3.0|I enjoyed the wide collection of anecdotes, but the book lacked deep or objective analysis.<br /><br />Steve Jobs was clearly the force behind Apple's resurgence.  The stories about how Jobs had the ideas or how those ideas evolved were the best.<br /><br />The constant apologies for Jobs' cruel, amoral, irrational and/or hypocritical behaviors get tiresome.  Isaacson, like many people who excuse Jobs' behavior sound like Stockholm Syndrome victims.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and yet feel unsatisfied. The writing and telling of the stories was expertly done, but end up coming across more as entertaining, ghost-written autobiography than as in-depth objective history.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun game I think you would like it I would say this game is just a little hard but really awesome
193700788X|5.0|Ignore all the naysayers -- this is a terrific ending to the series!  A bunch of old enemies try to off Sookie *yet again*, repeatedly, and she survives it all.  An old love has become a good friend.  A very recent love has chosen lengthy success in his vampire world over life with a short lived mortal.  Seems a reasonable choice, practically speaking.  And a long term relationship is going to become The Longterm Relationship.  What could be more perfect?!  I even had tears in my eyes as it ended.  I LOVED IT!!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Best book ever. So... peculiar!!!(: I loved every second of it. More should read this book! I can't wait for the sequel!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Works great on my droid razr M. Very quick and the zoom is great when working in the windows environment .
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Read this while recovering from surgery. It made me forget all about my pain except when laughing out loud strained my incision. Very entertaining, affectionate expose of the restaurant industry. Chock full of unforgettable characters : Adam Real-last name-unknown and Bigfoot my favorites. Could have used a glossary for those of us who didn't attend culinary school.
0307887448|5.0|I loved the 80s references and old arcade games.  Good mix of genres.<br /><br />Can't believe it's his first novel. Highly recommended.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app rocks. I used it to reconfigure not only my hot spot but to also setup a network at someone else's house to find the best place to put their router. I think the gieger counter style strength bar is my favorite part.
B0067EKYS6|1.0|CGI is becoming the ruin of serious films. Its over-use is leading to films that ever more cartoonish with overblown designs, garish colors and visuals that are notable for their utter excess. This film, in my opinion, takes things to a whole new level of ugly. Its a visually loud film with no real sense of style to speak of. Like most CGI, its so poorly done that it screams obvious fake at least to me. The film has all the visual style of Joel Schumaker's 1997 \\"Batman and Robin\\" and that is not a complement. Some have complained about the music not being appropriate. I'm not sure about that. If anything, they didn't go far enough with the music. Only a disco soundtrack straight out of the 1970s would have been appropriate.<br /><br />Worse yet is the script which isn't very respectful of the novel. They invented a new framing sequence which was completely unnecessary. They seemed desperate to make Daisy Buchanan a good and likeable character which she should not be. What I liked the least was the removal of Gatsby's father from the story. The father showing up to the funeral is, in my opinion, one of the great moments in the entire book.<br /><br />Many of the other key moments in the story are simply overwhelmed by the visuals and noise. The meeting in the city with Meyer Wolfshiem falls flat as a scene because there is so much \\"junk\\" going on for the sake of going on in the background. They keep going back to a trumpet player on a fire escape for no particular reason.<br /><br />As far as casting, Leonardo DiCaprio works out as the main character far better than I would have expected. He captures the essense of being a fake very well. Joel Edgerton doesn't work as Tom Buchanan at all. They needed someone who could do a credible WASPy rich hypocrite and that is just not him. Elizabeth Debicki is good, but her character is not given much of anything to do. Amitabh Bachchan was a misfire in that someone seems to have told him to play the part as a vampire. The faults of \\"Daisy\\" are faults in the construction of the script. Tobey Maguire does a reasonable job, but nothing special.<br /><br />In some sense, many of the flaws of the film are really simply expressions of Baz Luhrmann's style. But where Moulin Rouge seemed in step with excess of the times when it was released, Gatsby seems completely out of touch.<br /><br />In terms of the music, Luhrmann's comments sort of speak for themselves:<br /><br />\\"The question for me in approaching Gatsby was how to elicit from our audience the same level of excitement and pop cultural immediacy toward the world that Fitzgerald did for his audience? And in our age, the energy of jazz is caught in the energy of hip-hop.\\"<br /><br />The problem of course is that where they went for that excitement, energy and pop cultural immediacy to a couple people who no longer have ANY of those things: Jay Z and Beyonce. They found \\"pop culture immediacy\\" in established acts like Fergie, U2, Bryan Ferry and Amy Winehouse among others. The idea of using high-energy modern music was not a bad one, but they didn't carry it through. They went for celebrity names and a style of music that was low energy.<br /><br />People who like the overblown style of Baz Luhrmann and who are not very familar with the novel might enjoy this. But for me, it was just a pointless display of excess.s of \\"Daisy\\" are faults in the construction of the script.

B001ANYDAO|4.0|This is the third book by Gladwell that I read, although I think it was published first. As with Blink and with The Tipping Point, Gladwell did an excellent job making social science interesting to a general audience. He also reads the Audible recording himself.<br /><br />The thesis of the book is that someone becomes world class in whatever they do by being born in the right year and in the right neighborhood and that they need only be slightly above average in natural ability. There is also a lot of information on airline accidents. Gladwell supports his viewpoint using only anecdotal evidence, but he does provide an overwhelming amount of anecdotal evidence. He fails to identify and disprove alternate explanations.
B002C949KE|5.0|Predictably Irrational was both educational and hillarious. The book was written by a behavioral economics researcher at MIT. He describes human subjects escapades, such as:<br />(1) Playing 'Let's Make a Deal' with the children that visit his house on Halloween night.<br />(2) Spending weeks in the campus pub doing beer survey research and convincing the university to pay a $1,400 dollar reimbursement for all the drinks that he bought the study participants.<br />(3) Asking students to stop and take surveys while in the throws of passion.<br />to name a few.<br /><br />I have the Audible version, which was narrated by Simon Jones, who is absolutely the best audiobook narrator I've every heard. It not only sounds as if the author is reading his own work, but listening to him actually feels like you are chatting with an interesting researcher in a leisure setting.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Would love a second to see how their lives ended. Marriage? Katie having a baby? Rebuilding their house on the beautiful beach...

B00499K9E0|5.0|Simply the best detective on tv today.  American Tv can learn so much from the BBC.  The story line is superb.  Dialogue is superior to any on American TV show currently airing. The writing is witty. I am watching the seasons again  for the third time and see things that I missed the first two times.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this  show.  Sherlock is the new sexy. The acting is terrific. From Sherlock and Watson down to the landlady.  I can't wait for the new season.  This could rivial the successful original law and order (American) franchise. I only only wish there were more than three episodes in the seasons. If you are looking for a fresh new drama tv show then Sherlock is for you.
B00464AVXW|5.0|I know real highbrow types may not like this movie, and it bears absolutely no relation to a real police investigation.  That being said, I really enjoyed this movie for what it is: entertainment, nothing more or less.  This is not a police training film, it is just entertainment and I think it filled the bill very nicely.  The actors did there jobs well, the plot did not have too many twists and it still managed to keep me interested all the way through.  it is a worth-wile addition to the DVD library in the Man Cave.
0451418433|4.0|Having lived through most of this era, I was interested in the different views of people from all sides of the conflicts.  Trying to keep straight all the characters would have been impossible for me without the list of them in the preface.  Meeting family members of the first book of this trilogy was also satisfying.

0743571975|1.0|This is NOT \\"UNABRIDGED\\". It is NOT the original text. It has been edited by Ruth L. Miller and she should have left it alone. The precision and power of this remarkable book is in its original form. These various editors do a great disservice to the reader by updating any of these classic books, and disgrace the original authors, such as Charles F. Haanel. I was very disappointed in this product obviously. The original is online in audio and written form free. I will go back to that, download audio free. I really wanted the truly original text on CD. It amazes me how many people want to butcher the original classic books in order to try to make a name for themselves. Just leave the original public domain text alone. We don't need your copyrighted abridged junk.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Original movie with an unexpected ending. Beautiful actress makes the movie worth watching and over all great movie to watch...
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Tom Cruise, as usual, provides an action packed amazing performance is this thriller.  I will definitely read the books and follow the action there as well.

B005NFVZTM|4.0|This movie was enjoyable. The background on many of the characters we have come to love was well done and the actors portrayed their character personalities with clarity and convincing regard to the &#34;older selves&#34; that left us as the audience believing that they were indeed the same character.<br />The special effects were well done.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Looking forward to reading the next one. It is reminiscent of Hunger Games although very different. Very visual and descriptive. I could picture everything in the book. Can't wait for 2/14/2014 to see the movie!

B009UX2YAC|1.0|Subway Surfers is an excellent game to play. I like it because because you can jump on trains, ride on hoverboards,get special powers like the mega head start or a jetpack, also you can get prizes out of the  Prize box like money or keys. That's why I like Subway Surfers and you should download it and play as long as you want. There is also one more thing,if you play Subway Surfers 5days on a row, you a prize out of a special prize box.Like once I got a trophie out of the special prize box.

If you haven't read the book you will probably think this is amzing without a second thought but if you have read the book i suggest you give this a chance. Overall a great movie
1575666286|5.0|Try this therapy to heal from your rheumatoid arthritis .It makes so much sense that all the junk we eat is not really food and is harmful to our bodies. If we can eat fruits and veggies and heal our tummys our whole body will heal. Avoid eating junk and eat nutritious food and avoid poisonous meds.  Great book!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|If you are trying to decide if you should read it or not, Buy it right now and read it all. I love books and cant really decide my favorite book, butthis got pretty close! Read if you liked: the hunger games, divergent, matched, and books of that nature

B009UX2YAC|5.0|(reviewer age 10)<br />I like that it has a lot of power ups.<br />I like to play it as often as I can.<br />It never ends.<br />It compares favorably with Temple Run.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I loved it and will continue to watch as the twisted story unfolds. Tatiana is a truly gifted actor. Brilliant story line with interesting characters.
B00AIBZM40|3.0|Overall it was pretty good and worth watching until they got to the end. Ending was kind of weak. Seemed like they started to lose focus at the end.

1594746168|5.0|The Resurrectionist: The Lost Work of Dr. Spencer Black, is the joining of two books in one. I for one love the intelligence behind the concept of creating anatomical drawings for mythical creatures/entities, and author/artist E. B. Hudspeth has something magical on his hands here. It is a great quality softcover, and the content is quite engaging. The book is divided between the bio of Dr. Black and his detailed anatomical studies in the Codex Extinct Animalia. If one ever wondered what the anatomical drawings of a chimera, a mermaid, or an angel might look like, this book confidently provides the answers. There are some questions left about mermaid anatomy, but that didn't overly bother me.<br /><br />This is not a perfect monstrous anatomical compendium, but it is probably on of the best available and in print. I found Dr. Black's back story interesting, but what really gripped me was the creature anatomy illustrations. If that is your primary interest, then don't hesitate to check this book out. As a story in and of itself, I think it could be a bit more fleshed out, but still found it interesting.<br /><br />~ Kort
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent book!  If you have lost a loved one, this is the book to read.  It makes you KNOW that you will be with them again.  Animals too!  Doesn't discuss religeon - just straight forward re-telling of what happened during the week he was in a coma.  Amazing.  Scientifically based.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I real enjoyed this game! The puzzles were fun to figure out and the hidden picture portions were clever! I reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys mystery/hidden picture games. Five stars!
B00C1BHQXK|4.0|The book is an excellent process for stepping out with intention.  Found many useful tools shared to implement.  Highly recommend to anyone wanting to matter.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Some parts were a little uncomfortable to read, but it kept my interest at a peak.  Story stayed with me for a long time.

1430319321|5.0|I have probably not gotten through quite 10% of this book yet, but I am extremely pleased. I am getting the answers that I have been searching for. How do you set up a pin? How do other players see what I am not seeing? What are the different ways to use this information?<br /><br />The author of this book has the insights that I need, but much more important, he has taken the time and effort to explain all those smaller details of seeing and setting up the tactical configurations that win material and game, and most important, give you the chance to take more control of the game.<br /><br />Eliminate luck and hope from the game and set up those powerful tactical maneuvers that are part of a great, artistic chess game.<br /><br />I know there are lots of people who do not play tournaments, but love the game and art of chess. We don't aspire to become masters, but want to learn and understand the artistry and skills of tactical play. We don't have the time to struggle with deep discussions and try to see further into a masters explanation of high level skills, but we want to 'see' more. So much of this game is about visualization, and Mr. Farnsworth will guide you through the complexities of seeing in a manner that will actually be fun and entertaining and enlightening.<br /><br />I read, study and review the information in this book everyday, and enjoy doing it. I highly recommend this book for the rest of us.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|We lost our cable in the first week. Luckily these are available and relatively affordable. It's black, does what it needs to do, and is just long enough to use on the device while charging.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book is so lame and boring! I was elated to get the book a day early and start reading...... And then I couldn't stop putting it down! UGH! A chore to read! Who are these characters and what did you do with Eric and Sookie??? After so many years of reading and loving these characters, I'm completely let down.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Lots of good information in this app.  Colorful and responsive.  The radar is great.  Well worth the cost for amateur weather enthusiasts.
B000SEGEKI|1.0|To buy this book as a paperback you have to pay $36 as a kindle book it is only 4 dollars cheaper. I think something goes very wrong, when a digital version is so expensive. $31 is simply to much for a book that does not need to be printed.

1400069742|5.0|Most of the books I've read on World War II generally focus on the combat battles that occurred throughout Europe and Asia. Those Angry Days by Lynne Olson is the first book I've ever seen that goes into comprehensive detail about the internal debate that occurred throughout the United States between 1939-1941.<br /><br />While the central figures on the front cover are FDR and Charles Lindbergh, they are merely the key figures that represented two sides of the interventionist-isolationist debate as war raged throughout Europe. This battle across the country from the stage of Broadway to the cornfields of the Midwest and everywhere in between. Groups representing both viewpoints would eventually engage in violent clashes on America's street corners. The interventionist-isolationist debate divided the country in a way not seen since the days of the American Civil War.<br /><br />Lynne Olson tells the story of a country divided and the vocal and impassioned personalities on both sides. With an intense eye for detail and the unique gifts of a master storyteller, the author puts the reader squarely in the middle of the United States circa 1941. I was so engrossed by the book that I couldn't put it down and focus on my graduate seminar. Every person depicted in the book is drawn in such great detail that the reader feels as though they are being subjected to the venomous attacks of the interventionists and isolationists.<br /><br />One of my favorite books of 2013.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|The Blind Side is an incredible story of how a pure-hearted rich lady saw & felt -- beyond peer pressure & cultural norms -- a hurting soul (Michael Oher) whom she devoted herself to helping.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I add it to my collection of Jennifer Lawrence, one of my favorite actress.  She is really excellent in it.  Which is why she deserve the Oscar.  It is funny, and cute movie.
0062082353|5.0|In light of what happened to America's top sniper, his past experiences are well worth reading I gave two as gifts
B0024F08RO|5.0|These characters are great and the writers did an incredible job with this show. I recommend it to anyone who loves the thrill of constant, on the edge of your seat action!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This is a good game for anyone it is kind of like temple run but it has a few extra features the armors are difficult to unlock but it's a good game
B001NLL93W|5.0|Amazing is how to describe this book. I love it and hope every person in junior high reads it. This book is just great and have a new adventure on each page that haves you staying up all night to finish it.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Very informative movie. While I knew about some things in the movie, there were other information that I did not. I have started getting back to farmer markets and making the right choices with meats, eggs and chicken. It is time to make a change. At least I can make a change in our lives. All we have to do is make a change...one bite at a time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written and incredibly naive and immature. I would not be surprised to find out the author has never had sex in her life. If you like this book you need to take a good hard look at your life and find a way to fix it.  The sex scenes were not that hot, if you thought so you need to get a little more creative in the bedroom.  Maybe try living life and having sex rather than fantasizing about might help you.
0307341577|2.0|I absolutely loved Sharp Objects, Gillian Flynn's first novel. I was also gripped by Gone Girl.  Dark Places was such a disappointment.  Characters so unsympathetic and dull I gave up persevering. I shall never know who wiped out the Day family and I don't care.  Nevertheless, I will be keen to check out Flynn's next novel in the hope it will be as wonderful as her first and third.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|In tradition of MGS, Revengeance has awesome music that fits the game. Power and some industrial and symphonic metal. What makes the sound even better are the lyrics, which along are great but actually are written for the game, specifically the characters and the themes, which I think needs to be done more now that MGR and Platinum have shown how great it works. If you played you know that first battle how sweet it was to get those vocals when you're tearing it up.<br /><br />But wow. If you were hoping for  something resembling what you heard during the game... (instrumental building until some key point where the vocals enter) or &#34;full length&#34; songs, well not here and not on the soundtrack released with some versions of the game.<br /><br />Theses are all awesome, but wow check out youtube for some longer tracks, and even some original versions. I wish Konami would release a complete OST with the full length versions of these songs, along with all the other little pieces during cut-scenes. Collective Consciousness and Stranger I Remain are my favorite.
193700788X|5.0|Well done Mrs. Harris.  This was a logical conclusion to Sookie's story arc.  Even though it didn't end the way I would have liked (John Quinn just does it for me) I believe Sookie's greatest chance for happiness was with the man you chose for her.<br /><br />It puzzles me that so many readers believe they have the right to determine what happens to characters that do not belong to them.  That's rather like telling someone how they should be raising their children when having none of one's own.  The level of hostility is just astonishing.  Has no one seen the movie \\"Misery?\\"  Some days it seems as though our society is so full of people who feel they are entitled to everything they want when they want it and devil take anyone who disagrees with them, that I fear for the future of civilized society.<br /><br />I've read every book you've ever written and will continue to buy and read your books.  I'm just grateful that you haven't let the negative energy of spoiled brats impede your writing your stories, your way.  Looking forward to whatever you write next.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was so amazing! I am absolutely speechless! Im glad this book had a happy ending! I would definitely recommend this book!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I love this movie. fantastically stylized in classic Tarantino style. You're either going to love it or hate it. word.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|The Harry Bosch character has always had great appeal and Connelly continues to put him in New and interesting LAPD situations.  I'll continue to look for new Connelly thrillers.
B000N0WCLC|5.0|Leonardo give a performance i originally never expected from him. thats why i loved this movie. also pointent information contained within.
B001QC7DY2|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Angeline Jolie, that said, she did an excellent performance playing a single mother dealing with her missing child.  The system tried to turn her story around and make her the villian, not the victim. Her character refused to stop fighting against seemingly insurmountable odds.  It makes you wonder, if this very scenario hasn't actually happened more than once to those not willing to buck the system.  It reminds us that no &#34;system&#34;, played here by the corrupt police, should have ABSOLUTE POWER.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. it is the best. sometimes. I do not even use the one button. I love it

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Must watch! Jennifer Lawrence's character was spot on and I would watch this over and over! Wonderful supporting cast. I say 5 stars for this one.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I loved the way the author wrote. Very descriptive.  I thought it got a littlong in parts, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It certainly was a well written book, but the idea for the story, the characters themselves, were all very strange. I guess I just never connected with a single character in the book.  The style of writing a book using letters written to a &#34;friend&#34; was unique, and so I gave it credit for creativity.  I wound not recommend it to a friend.
B001KZOUQE|3.0|Everyone else has already discussed the storyline, its relevance to the comic book and comments on acting. I will only focus on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray. ( However, did like seeing how young Connie Briton, with a small part as the coach's wife appeared and appreciated how her part in the TV series, which I watched all the time, had grown.<br /><br />I did not have this movie on a Standard Def DVD so it certainly will not be a comparison between the two.<br /><br />VIDEO...the transfer is very clean with no artifacting or aliasing of any kind.  There were no problems during playing the Blu Ray disc.  The colors are deliberately desaturated and created a softer look, however, the contrast was really quite good and grain is kept to a minimum.  I was surprised at how high the bit rate was, averaging in the mid 30's.  There is some controversy over bit rates on Blu Ray as many believe that the higher the bit rate, the less compression there is done to the film.  Others believe that Bit Rates are irrelevant and that  there is no  direct linear correspondence between bit rate and picture quality.  In truth, bit rate is just a measure of how much data there is in a picture stream and certainly not all films need the same amount of data.  I am on the fence and believe that the higher the bit rate, usually, the better the image since more data is reaching the screen.<br /><br />AUDIO.... The lossless DTS HD 5.1 audio provided an excellent spread of the soundtrack  across the front stage.  Dialogue is very clear and transparent and there will be no need to play roller coaster with your remote's volume control. All audio levels are the way they should be.  The rear channels provide much ambient crowd noise boosted by the LFE sub channel.  There is not a whole lot of discreet directionality sent to the rear channels nor need for the sub to do more than boost ambient noise.  Foley effects are mostly spread across the front stage but not much panning to the sides or rear.  Never the less, the audio is really quite good, just not to be used for a demo disc to show off your system.<br /><br />Extras...Plenty of deleted and extended scenes, none that would be better served in an extended edition.  Lots of other extras about the original team this movie was based upon, and making of documentaries.<br />For the price, if you liked the movie, get the Blu Ray.  However, since this is not a comparison of the blu ray and Standard Def DVD, I can't say just how much of an improvement there will be.  Since the video on Blu Ray is as clean as it is, my bet is that there would be a somewhat significant difference and lossless audio, to me, is very noticeable on any Blu Ray as compared to a lossy codec.  Lossless is always better.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.rear.

B00005AQF6|5.0|I'm not an expert on the genre but this is the best hip-hop/rap album of all time. It is basically the only album I listened to in the 7th grade.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great value! Most backpack camera bags in this price range can only fit the camera and a couple of lenses. I got both my camera bodies to fit + 4 lenses and my bounce flash. Comfortable to wear I would highly recommend!
B004QL7K6G|5.0|We had rented this movie  before we bought on Amazon, so we knew we had to get it. There are so many funny parts here you don't have much dry spells in between.<br /><br />Really surprised it wasn't more popular.<br /><br />Must see!
193700788X|1.0|I'll get straight to the point! This last novel in the Sookie Stackhouse series is a complete hum drum bore & a waste of time to read! what a way to go out!...not with any kind of bang...that is! Honestly, this series first started out so promising, exciting, cant put the book down...then it started to slowly fall apart around the 9th book & it only got worse...till this last tragic book(13th). Maybe its best she put Sookie  to rest, cause it was getting really irritating & sad to see such a great series & characters fall apart like they where. In my opinion, the storyline & books started to fall apart when season 1 of True Blood on HBO came out. It was like she was pushing out poorly written books to keep up with each new season of True Blood...just for the $$$(makes sense, her last 5 books where a disaster & theres 5 seasons in True Blood). If theres any truth to that statement above that makes Charlaine Harris a sell out & dollar signs where her only concern. Screw her characters, screw her fans! it was like she just gave up & didnt care about either & that was definately evident in her last 5 novels. Dissapointing to know this series ended like this! Sooo boring, nothing exciting, no real plot, just ramblings of nothing intresting. Well, at least I can go back & read the first 8 books & remember all the great characters that way! True dissapointment! Rip...Sookie Stackhouse novels!
B007RCJNDE|5.0|It was the grand ending the series deserved. Wondered how all story lines would & could come together at the end and was satisfied how Jordan and Sanderson managed it. Great series and fantastic last book.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|There are way more good reviews than bad. I was skeptical at first.  This may be one of my new favorite metal albums of all time.  I think the music is interesting, the messages are clear and great, and its fn heavy.  I'm a fan of a lot of styles of music, this band was always ok to me, but this album definately does it for me.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat, and highly recommend it, in fact, now I really want to see them live.  Damn fine album.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love playing this game. It does require being patient if you do not want to spend money. I like that there are different quests, goals, and events beyond the search and find games
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Came in great condition and it is Dr Who, so it is amazing. I think people over look this Doctor due to David, but he is a great Doctor.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|I have to say that I expected to like this movie. What I didn't expect was to fall head over heels in love with it.  Better told than the book, I must say.  The actors are superb, and the second watch through, once you are more comfortable with the story and characters, the humor begins to shine through even more.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really love this game.  This game is addicting! I get yelled at for being on my kindle all the time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The action keeps the reader interested. As always, another Grisham page turner, or maybe I should say another kindle page advancer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If u like horses u should play u can compete in competition. U can buy other horses and buy tack for them and this game is not inappropriate little kids can play and so can adults people should play this game I love it In fact it is my favorite game I think it shod be its to plz play this game ant rate a five star this is a great game
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I am a huge iron man fan and I love this game it is so fun to play and I love it.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I had no idea what to expect from this book and was delightfully surprised. I read a lot of paranormal romance stories and it was nice to have a creative slant on the typical vampire / werewolf story.<br /><br />And in my opinion, the strong female characters are a necessary part of a story. Honoria was well portrayed with her struggles to trust anyone - especially someone like Blade. I enjoyed her strength, intelligence and determination.  Having never read any stories from Bec McMaster's steampunk England, I had no idea what Blue Bloods, Echelon and the Fade were and it took a while to figure it out. But there are enough pieces of information that were uncovered throughout the story that it didn't wind up frustrating.<br /><br />Although in some ways this was a typical romance story, there was enough world building and plot to make it a lot of fun to read and definitely had me rooting for the characters.  I loved both Blade and Honoria and am looking forward to visiting their world once again.<br />Note: this books does include explicit sex scenes however they are balanced against a plot that is intriguing and has potential for more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play Subway surfers almost every day. I love how there are challenges that you have pass to get prizes and new characters! All tough I've never been to any of these places, it's a lot of fun seeing what they look like from the comfort of my suburban home! I encourage other 5th grade gamers like me to play this amusing game, I assure you that you'll love this popular game! 😎😘😉
B00AFPTSI0|4.0|Adam has written a great book on the skills and strategies to allow you to give, not worry about getting, and still be successful.  It's loaded with practical steps and everyday examples of what selfless or otherish givers have accomplished by being true to themselves.  It's a little academic in spots and loaded with links to other research studies, but a great read and a life manual that's time has come.
B008FQ1O1K|1.0|I only read this book because it was required for my book club, and I had to force myself to read past the first chapter. This sort of lowest-common-denominator writing masquerading as a vehicle for supposedly deep and meaningful messages that are already obvious to everyone anyway really annoys me.
B000TETD9Q|4.0|This covers a lot of territory.  You get teenage anthems, sweet love songs, rollicking surfer songs, and Wall of Sound classics.  Start the Woody, wax your board, grab your best girl, sing along and pretend you are a California girl or boy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked the book but didn't care for the ending.  Would still recommend the book though.  My favorite from this author was Dark Places.
B008220BLG|3.0|This was a good movie, though not a great movie. Prior to seeing it I had a notion that it would be a hilarious, romantic drama/thriller. It was not! Yes, there was comedy and sweet moments in the movie, however it was nowhere near the caliber of what everyone insinuated it would be like in their recommendations/articles. The acting in itself was good, the storyline for the most part was clever and witty. Most of the the things I disliked were small so I won't bother mentioning it because it probably made no difference to anyone else. My main problem with the movie was the actual zombies. In many scenes they did not behave like zombies. They behaved like a human who was trying to pretend to be a zombie. It was overdone and not believable. R (aka Romeo) and the other zombies supposedly started transforming back into people after R met the girl Julia (aka Juliette). However, by his own admission he listened to music and had limited words with a few of the other zombies prior to meeting her. That is not something zombies are supposed to do. I also found it weird that the zombies seemed to know their surroundings, and each other. That goes against the lore of zombieism. To me the movie was definitely overrated and outlandishly positively critiqued by pretty much every critic and film goer that I know. Based on the recommendations of my family and friends, I expected something far better. In short, is it worth a rental! Yes! Would I buy it? No!
B003AKLFAG|5.0|I am beyond words.This movie was like no other I ever seen with a plot, and twist I couldn't even imagine. I heard so much about it and wanted to see it for myself and I must say I was not disappointed.
B007HACDLK|4.0|that's what it feels like when you slip on this baby. It's great to have Irene, mitch scott and the gang. these books are not the most politically correct books out there and that is why these books are so entertaining. Flynn deals with a lot of political reality through the eyes of rapp. the world would be a safer place if there were a real mitch rapp out there. safer even if there were a bunch of mitch rapp's running around.
B0026QC0YU|5.0|It was an awesome feeling to view the movie on Amazon Prime because I had the ability to view the series again.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|nice game very addicting and I cant stop playing this game I reccomend this app yo any one looking tor a addicting game
B00BN3EE1O|1.0|One must wonder about the derth of actresses in Hollywood, after all, having given three prime roles (Footlose, Rock Star, Safe Haven) to someone who has one plastic face, and wears it all the time; who doth protest her \\"innocence\\" (ah, those pesky Mormons...does technical virginity really apply when one has played bump and grind more than a retired street walker?). And of course, one sees these same plastic, one-note faces on Amy Adams and Katherine Heigel who even as they parade around in, virtually, nothing, proclaim their \\"innocent\\" natures and allegiance to Mormonism.<br /><br />Hough is not the worst actress to ever be cast in a movie; she is The Very Worst because she is not an actress. One would think that Tom Cruise, who generally does great movies, would have known better. Really, does pelvic thrusting qualify as a resume? Next up for Hough is (apparently) Paradise where she will once again put on the plastic face (aka you-will-sit-in-this-Mormon-pew-for-five-hours-and-pretend-that-Mormonism-is-not-a-crock-rather-than-the-pyramid-gestapo-scheme-it-really-is) and pretend that she actually got these roles by way of \\"talent\\", albeit masquerading as someones \\"girlfriend.<br /><br />So many talented actresses, Hollywood, please do not inflict this Hough upon us again.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|I was hooked from the very first minute of the very first song.  Great sound quality, strong songs, lyric worthy, and what a voice.  One minute I heard a Dylan influence, then I heard an Oasis influence, and at all times heard a crispness and clarity like I haven't in years.  A bit of British invasion, a bit of 60's folk, but an honesty & self confidence that is timeless.  Can't wait for another.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This product works well, even in large rooms with background noice. Really easy to download and use. Nice graphics and feel.
B004VBAHG6|5.0|I was happy with this.  I didn't feel like the last three were strong releases and was starting to worry.  He needed a good band, and for me, this works just fine.  A lot of variation here, some ballads, lots of rockers, and the standout for me, the guitar heavy but slow \\"Uneven & Brittle\\".  Passionate and smoldering, the rawest guitar work on any song of his since Bauhaus. He still can break the wine glasses with vocals like these. I am amazed he can keep this up, and look forward to another with this line-up.
B000FCKIFU|3.0|It's difficult to believe that a former government assassin would become involved in such a juvenile group and such ridiculous situations.  It's an easy read, but definitely not for someone interested in serious intrigue.
193700788X|1.0|I agree with some of the reviews...hardly any vampires for a series based on vampires, filled with minor characters from older stories, and it feels like Harris took the easy way out...nothing really changes for Sookie in the end. I guess finishing off the series with a disappointment will ensure readers will not miss it. I really wish it could have been different because I was really excited for this book. I would have liked to see more closure with Eric if their relationship was going to end...it seemed they cared for each other...the final book made Sookie into a shallow character I no longer cared about.
030758836X|2.0|I don't know how this book got picked for so many top 10 lists, but it is just terrible!<br /><br />The writing is done in such a way that keeps you guessing til the very end, and when you find out what happens in the end you are left with plain disgust.  SPOILER (I guess): the main characters are absolutely horrible people and they end up both victorious.  I would say read it and you'll see what I mean, but don't! Put your money towards something else.<br /><br />The writing is also amatuer.  There were some places that it seemed like the author was backed into a corner and she used a broad-brush to generalize situations to get the characters out of something... I really am trying to not give away too much, but you are better off getting a different book.  There are better ones out there.
B000002KYR|3.0|The drums dont feel like frank beard and the bass is just keyboards.it takes more then guitar to make a great album for me.frank beard is a fantastic drummer why in the world would they need a dmx drum machine which makes the rtythm section boring.but because of the great song writing and guitar ill give it 3 stars.my fav zztop album is tejas.<br />the songs live do rock better though!<br />And i have to say the song if i can only flag her down should have been a big hit also!just as good as the other hits from the album.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Tokyo subway surf is a great game I would reccomend<br />This game to anyone at all. You are doing graffiti and<br />When you press play you have to their jump swipe or skid.<br />So you can leg it away from the security guard. This game is not a waste<br />Of money at all.bit like temple run.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Don't hesitate to order and start reading, just be warned, you will want to read and read and read until the end.  The only disappointment is when you can't order book #3 yet.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Perfect casting of characters. Well written and beautifully executed. Kudos to the director(s) of this motion picture. Chris Tucker didnt have much screen time but was the icing on the cake to a twisted but classy film. I streamed this movie and will soon purchase the Blu-Ray for my collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Flow Free! Everyone in my family plays this! I love that it takes reasoning and logic! My 7 and 9 year old boys are getting pretty good!
1250012570|5.0|I married my childhood love, 31 years ago.  Those high school years weren't always easy, but he was and is my strength.  This captured the feelings so beautifully.  The end brought tears to my eyes.  I wanted so much more.  Having lived Eleanor's side, I especially enjoyed getting inside Park's thoughts.  I aleady read and liked Attachments.  Now I can't wait for Fangirl.  I might have a new favorite author!

B002SSUQFG|4.0|I like this watch, it looks nice and all but if you don't wear it everyday it will stop working or lose time, keep that in mind.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|calculator plus free has fast calculations and it's easy to use. It's basic and simple but all that I need in a calculator.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|I purchased the movie to watch an compare it from the other movies which I liked. The movie was very good to watch.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I preface this review by noting that I have not seen the movie but had wanted to read it after the great things that I had heard about it.  It didn't disappoint.  The book is great and very well written.  It is a great story that I looked forward getting back to.  I am sad that it ended at 200 or so pages...
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I saw this moving simply because I was feeling a bit blue and I needed a good refill of passion to keep my mind going, the movie did pick me up, it was fill of good emotion, which movies lack in this age we live in.<br /><br />I liked the unneeded loyalty that Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) has on the past, it somehow reminded me of myself, which some men hold loyalties longer then they should.  Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) was the black widow, a mysterious girl indeed; she will have you saying \\"why did she do that\\" one moment and then \\"no don't do it\\" the next. Tiffany played by Jennifer Lawrence did do a wonderful job.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone that's feeling blue and wants that pick me up and this movie will diffidently do that.
B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|We all know the movie was super cute and original, I won't go into a summary of it : ) we didn't see it in the theater so I ordered the Monday before it released on Prime and paid to have it overnighted. Showed up by 10 am the next day (can't beat it!) and my kids and I watched three times the first day! Super cute.<br /><br />I just wish the case, which holds 4 separate discs has a spot for each. It only has two \\"deep ones so you have to stack them on top of each other. That's my only gripe - otherwise, great buy and fun family film!
B00BESIKWM|3.0|It's hard to top a good original. This one to me fell short. The effects were fine but that's it.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|I first watched Cloud Atlas when it was in theaters, and I quickly fell in love with it. I left the theater with an urge to watch it again, in order to better understand the plot, and for enjoyment. The way the writers and director were able to intertwine the six different stories in a coherent and flowing way was incredible. It definitely requires you to pay a little more attention throughout, if you want to fully grasp how everyone is connected across the timelines. I was personally first drawn to the movie after seeing the incredible futuristic Neo-Seoul scenes in the trailers, and I was pleasantly surprised when I ended up loving every timeline in the movie. I did not read the book prior to watching the film, but reading it afterwards, I was happy to see how accurate and faithful the film was to the book. 5/5 this is an excellent film to watch, and is one of those films you end up enjoying even more the second time around
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|awesome game. very addictive.graphics are great.  you look forward to finding and raising each new creature.  even my 10 year old loves it.
1451695195|3.0|Pretty technical language, I was a little disappointed.  I couldn't understand him quite often.  Still a most remarkable experience in all.
1476734941|5.0|I love this program!  I&#34;ve never been able to stick to anything long term, until now.  Having said that,  I probably need to eat less than what I'm currently doing on the off days, since I'm not losing every week.  The book is easy to read and very informative.  I found it easier to eat most of the calories at dinner, and to keep that meal as simple as possible, with little prepartion needed on my part.  I choose from a couple of different frozen dinners that I like from Lean Cuisine, averaging about 200-230 calories each, along with some fried peppers and snow peas that I put underneath the heated dinner.  Along with that I have some whole wheat melba toast and diet jello for dessert.  It's a simple menu that keeps me from having little to do when dinner time arrives.  The peppers are prepared earlier in the day or were made ahead of time on the previous fast day.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is fun and challenging at the same time.  Just when you think &#34;oh this is easy&#34;  it gives you a puzzle that makes you think a little harder.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I would rate it 4 1/2 stars but that was not an option.  I enjoy her humor and outlook.  Havn't read too many books that I would rate a 5 stars.  I did recommend it to some friends who enjoyed the audioversion on a driving trip.
B0053O89KG|5.0|The Plot Thickens and thickens and thickens.  I have had this set for only a short time and have just about worn it out!  This is better than sneaking chocolate in the middle of the night.  Obsession?  Heavens, no!  Well....maybe...sort of.  Add it to your collections of favorites.  You won't be sorry!
1469984202|5.0|i stumbled upon wool via one of those \\"if you like...\\" suggestion pages that, at least in my experience, are NEVER correct. but, when i read a few chapters of WOOL 1 on amazon, i was hooked--particularly for the price. after finishing the omnibus of WOOL 1-5, i can confidently say that this is my second favorite series ever (laugh all you want, but rowling's \\"harry potter\\" series is masterfully designed and will forever be my measuring stick) and i have also purchased it in hardback so the stories of holston, mayor jahns, juliette, lukas, solo, and all other silo residents can also be shared and enjoyed by family and friends. the series is refreshingly well-written, engrossing, and imaginative. perhaps most impressive is the entire world howey creates and the iron-clad rules that govern his underground society. just when you think you know the silos or have the plot all figured out, howey takes you on another wild ride. i can't wait to read the remaining silo books and can only hope that howey never decides to stop telling the stories of WOOL.
B0043JDUNS|2.0|The movie is great as I've seen it three times previously. Problem with this rental is the quality was terrible.  Very pixelated. Dark in a lot if scenes. We turned it off after an hour. Ill be requesting a credit.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I got this game and gave it to my son and he loved it! If you get this game you will be amazed! It's free to!
B006Z7Z3S6|4.0|Positive reviews for the Innkeepers seem few and far between. I'd like to start by saying that I agree with most of the complaints people have with this movie. As the title states, it's definitely slow and left a lot of plot to be filled in. The scares are also very limited as a whole. So what did I like about the movie enough to give it 4 stars?<br /><br />Characters - The two main characters in this movie were fun to watch. They both had unique personalities and they meshed really well together.<br /><br />Acting - Great performances from everyone, especially the two leads.<br /><br />Scary moments - There needed to be more, but I thought the scary scenes were well done and effective. I did have my headphones turned up though, so that may have made it a little better for me.<br /><br />This film is far from perfect and it did somewhat disappoint me with leaving so much left out of the back story of the spirits. I thought those things should have been fleshed out more, but I'm not going to trash on it because I have to say I did enjoy it.
B00884GR0W|5.0|omg this is amazing! lives up to the price. I suggest u buy it. it should be Chuck Norris approved
B00BDSRISA|5.0|I'm a casual fan of this band having discovered them after their amazing SNL performance.  I've got their major releases.  They're consistently good with good hooks and an effective combination of synths, guitar, and percussion that is reminiscent of the 80s.  If you like their other albums, you'll certainly enjoy this.  It's solid all the way through.
B009AHWLHE|5.0|Its was amazing movie.. i wish I could download it on my labtop and play it without it hving to be loading but other then that Best movie ever &#62;.&#60;
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|One of the all time greatest documentaries ever. So much history involved you'll learn something you never knew about making records.
B009HEMF1M|5.0|Damn good movie in every respect the cast, acting, story line, special effects, and sound effect are all top notch. I was expecting the movie to be good but it was way better than that.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun game. Takes some time to play. Few places you have to use hint. I liked the continues movement from one place to another threw out the story.
B009CF6IDM|5.0|I love this movie it has action to spare and the special effects are great the sound effects are also very good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|wish they word add guns lol. or crossbows or ninjas. just something weird lol. great game. i meaj great game
B002V0929W|5.0|I didn't realize the English were as described.  I am pleased to have had the tips on not to make a fuss and never be earnest.<br /><br />I do realize that coming from one of their colonies I have some similar behaviours but I am not exactly like the English thank goodness.  But I do appreciate their good points.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I don't know if that is bad or good, but I enjoy the highs and lows.  I liked it so  much I also bought the other two by &#34;Two Steps From Hell&#34;, Archangel and Skyworld.  I'm a little disappointed with Skyworld, but Invincible is my favorite.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|i have a space problem though i love kinect when i saw the kicect zoom i thought that my problem is solved<br />since I am living in Iraq i had to wait two weeks for my package to come installed it callibrate and everything looked fine but a dark cloud above me as shown in the screen<br />i had some new games that i tried but the device couldn't recognize me , it lose me all the time and couldn't recognize my moves<br />bottom of the line its a good way to waste your money<br />Dont buy it
B009VMN3RA|5.0|This book is well written, warm, and often funny.  Yet it didn't make me envy Sachi at all.  in fact, it made me appreciate my family even more.  Clearly privilege and don't make a person nice or warm or caring.  Shirley MacLaine is clearly the most self-centered person on the planet.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is one of the best I've ever read.  Beautifully written, it held my attention from start to finish.  The shocking note following was very informative and answered the question I wanted to know as I read the book.  So glad to have come across this fascinating, entertaining, and informative book. I will highly recommend this book many, many times.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Another fabulous movie by Tarantino. Gotta love it.<br />Kudos to the Amazon movie service too - first time using it. But I will be back for the excellent collection of movies.
1400069289|5.0|An insightful work.  Very glad that I purchased it.  This book should be on everyone's &#34;Must read&#34; list.  Helps explain why people do what they do but more importantly how to Change those things that people know should be changed.  An easy read book.
1451673442|5.0|love this book , highly recommend it to anybody, very positive and lots of great suggestions on how to change ones outlook
B0038W0OIK|3.0|This headset is very comfortable, and sounds great.  The software is tolerable, if not great.  The replaceable ear cups were a huge selling point for me, because I can't stand the weird, scratchy felt stuff that comes on many headsets.<br /><br />Build quality is where it fails to impress. The first one I purchased failed after about a year - both speakers would cut out randomly.<br /><br />Steelseries were kind enough to replace the first one that went bad with very little fuss - they set themselves apart from the competition (*ahem* Razr) by having good support.  But I'd rather have a product that works than a product that is fully backed by the manufacturer.<br /><br />The replacement failed with a similar problem several months ago, so it probably lasted about a year as well.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Love Hawaii Five-0. The behind the scenes looks, gag reel, and deleted scenes make me love it even more. Glad I made this purchase
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|It had lots of characterization which distinguishes it clearly from the movie, which I enjoyed as well, however I felt that the book stayed true to reality much more than did the movie. Due to the fact that the plot was vague, not many people have considered this book as one of their favorites, however I believe that characterization is more intellectual and interesting than plot. Truman Capote captured the personality of each and every character through their actions, and this appealed to me mostly because it enabled the readers to not only personally connect with any of the characters, but allows them to understand why certain actions or thoughts were made by each character. For this reason, I thought that this book was terrific, and definitely a good, smart read.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|When I was a child, Glenn Frey was my favorite member of the band EAGLES, because he was the singer of my favorite EAGLES songs... at the time. I guess when I was a child and growing up, Glenn Frey was a child who never has grown into an adult.<br /><br />According to the autobiography by Don Felder, Glenn Frey and Irving Azoff were the most significant causes for the EAGLES to fracture and break up. After watching this documentary, Irving still comes off as the \\"devil\\" that he is, but Glenn ends up being the \\"only ***hole in the band\\" (to use his own quote) that single-handedly destroyed what was once and could have been a truly great rock and roll band. The man is simply a dispicable person without any sense of humanity.<br /><br />In all fairness, all people join rock bands for different reasons. Some wish to be a part of a group of friends, enjoying life together and making enjoyable music. Some people do it for the fame, sex and off-stage fun. Some people do so for money. And then, some people do so for the purpose of feeding their ego's as their insecurities lead them to points of impoverished self-esteem and self-worth, thus they set out in overcompensation to prove that they are superior. This latter seems to be the basis of Glenn Frey's (and Irving Azoff's) existence as a human being.<br /><br />His insular personality chased away, Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner and Don Felder, and he alienated Don Henley to the point that only guarantees of tens of millions of dollars could force them to work together again. Worse, he cannot admit to any sense of the truth. He was a perpetual liar during the last three years of the EAGLES first tenure, and it appears that he continues to edit the truth of history to fit his singular view of himself.<br /><br />With that being said, this documentary is as honest as Glenn, Irving and even Don Henley would allow. Don spent his time in the late 70's avoiding questions of tensions and complications within the band and continues to do so throughout their perpetual reunion touring. Bernie, Randy and Don Felder offer their versions of the truth albiet with politeness and congeniality. Glenn Frey falters in every respect, with the only exception being that he finally admitted the truth that he would only accept Irving Azoff's offer to reunite the Eagles as long as he and Don Henley were paid (and treated) with greater monies and benefits than the others.<br /><br />Lastly, the story of why neither Randy nor Bernie were invited to reunite in 1994 is never discussed in the documentary nor the story of how Glenn attempted to thwart their appearance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony.<br /><br />Listening to Don Henley and Glenn Frey tiptoe around the meaning(s) behind the lyrics of HOTEL CALIFORNIA is worth the price of the set in and of itself. To listen to Randy Meisner singing TAKE IT TO THE LIMIT (and snippets of A CERTAIN KIND OF FOOL) also make the documentary well worth the price.<br /><br />Beyond that, the documentary is very enjoyable. I wish more would have been discussed about how the band created their music... but the inside stories are very enjoyable none-the-less.<br /><br />It is sad, that the EAGLES wrote about the corruption of mankind, by the evils of greed, ego and the temptations of life, yet obviously the band succumbed to the very perils it preached against. ROLLING STONE magazine and others perpetually decried the EAGLES for their \\"intelligence\\" and \\"preaching\\" lyrics, and often criticized the band for being hypocrites for such. In retrospect, the circumspect magazine got it right.<br /><br />God bless Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner, Don Felder and Joe Walsh (Don Felder certainly described Joe accurately in his memior.)<br /><br />We have the old records to enjoy whenever we want to re-visit the best days of our youth idealism, for we lost the EAGLES by October of 1976. I am glad that I saw them during the first leg of their 1994 tour, as that was the only period ofpeace and unity that the band ever shared after Bernie Leadon left.<br /><br />Had the band been more forthright and sincere in their interviews, this would have been a 5 star documentary (more akin to QUEEN: These Are The Days Of Our Lives) but sadly, the politeness of the various band members (except Glenn) turn this into a glossy magazine story. But, it is worth it to purchase and watch.<br /><br />Long live the music of the EAGLES.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|It's okay..not one of my favorites. Kind of after a couple of times I go back to my favorites.<br />Not one to get hitch too.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Getting ready to start the final book in the series. I am glad that they were recommended to me.
B000V86OKG|4.0|she loves the series worked out great for a moms day gift for her.<br />She also owns season one  and I intend to get her the rest of the series
B00AAQVSDW|3.0|Haven't had time to listen to it all, but what I've heard so far is good.  If the rest is the same I would rate it higher.
B000GW8OXC|2.0|There are suppose to be four seperate vinyls in it and when I unwrapped it, it had 3 and a repeat of the 3rd one. What kin of bogus production mistake is that? Now I have 3/4 of this beautiful album on vinyl. Not too much to complain about. It is an irritating thing to deal with.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I bought this app when I had a Samsung Epic 4G and played it on my phone all the time. I now have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and went to download it but noticed that it's been changed to \\"Kindle Tablet Edition\\" and is not compatible with my phone. It's also no longer compatible with my Epic 4G even though it was when I bought it.<br /><br />Nice of them to change the app without telling me and now I can't even use it!
B00008EY9G|5.0|I really enjoyed this suspence thriller, it was fun to watch and I would recommend it to anyone who loves murder mysterys. K. Jones
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book was the happy ever after Sookie and I needed<br />Congrats 's Harris you've done it again.<br />The end to a magically series
B005UDD1R6|4.0|Great little product that would be better with a &#34;stop&#34; or &#34;end&#34; or &#34;kill&#34;...for both the video you are watching and for the app itself.  Obviously moving the progress bar to the end gets you close to ending the video, but it plainly doesn't &#34;end&#34; it.  I also had some issues with the audio portion of .mp3s and such...sometimes I don't want it to play &#34;everything&#34; and I haven't quite got that worked out.  Partially my fault for not spending enough time with it...but a good app should also be &#34;intuitive&#34;.  Still, its free and I appreciate that and I'm thinking of getting the pay version.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Great game, but needs work. The kindle fire doesn't get the full version, so beware. Not worth spending any money on without the full version. HATE THAT IT IS NOT COMPLETE. IF YOU USE A KINDLE, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON BUYING THINGS! Fun to play though!
B004H6G0TI|3.0|Very inventive and cute game.  I think its better than many, but it can be a bit hard to control unless you're a gamer (IMHO).  Well worth giving a try if you like flight games.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is a good application, it worths its cost. I recommend it since it never crashes, keeps you informed of the battery's life and health and provides with good accuracy lenght of life subject to the use you give to your device.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Teamviewer is really a great product on a PC (I used it to teach my 70+ father Windows XP going straight from DOS).  Its also been great for supporting my kids across the country with their PC problems.  I checked it out on my 7&#34; tablet and it works just fine with a few adjustments, but in a pinch it can be a lifesaver.  Thanks and &#34;play fair&#34;!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Excellent...there's no doubt after reading this.  It is so interesting from a neuro's perspective going through his journey into heaven and then sharing his experience.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|awesome app, it allows us to manage our kindle fire with ease, it is very similar to using windows explorer
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The movie was so unusual. I'm usually afraid of bees but that kid had to face a Bengal Tiger especially after he lost his family. Great story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game, our kids love it and this is one of their favorite games on our mobile and tablet devices
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|He shines on the blues and upbeat numbers.  Some of the old covers left me a little cool.  The five or so I do like are great.
B000OVLINI|5.0|The book was great! The author such an imaginative way of expressing the feelings of the characters coupled with his beautiful way of describing every scene that it was so easy to get lost in the story! Like, &#34; the plaza was populated with characters&#34;!
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Great story. Highly recommended. There are a lot of principles to be learned from the book, as the author has embedded in the story.
1451662432|3.0|I have never been much into biographies so the fact that I read this at all says alot. I enjoyed the first half of the book his growing up, getting into body building and his body building and movies, part way into his movie career I started to strugle to keep reading<br />and that cotinued for the rest of the book but being Canadian I don't have much interest in the american political stuff, or details about his marige, so for others those chapters might be the highlights of the book what ever it all wrang true. and he is Arnold.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Unlike Lord of the Rings, which was a great story combined with action and wonderful effects, the Hobbit was slow moving at times and seemed to be more about the action and effects (which by the way were excellent).  It just wasn't a balanced effort like the LOTR trilogy.
0201633612|5.0|I loved this book and I loved the object-oriented programming class I bought it for! It was a great class with a great professor and this book is wonderful in describing and teaching you OO design patterns when you are a beginner. It will remain a great reference book on my shelf in years to come.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I enjoyed several of the story lines in this one. There wasn't an \\"oh s***!\\" moment like I had grown used to, but that's no doubt due to Martin's unique approach to this book and the one after it, splitting it by character instead of timeline. I thought I'd miss Tyrion but Jaime and Arya made up for it.    A fair warning to all, Martin paints a very grim picture of the treatment of women in his books. I am still wrestling with how much I care to read about rape and abuse, although it is interesting to see how he juxtaposes those unpleasant tales with the struggle of several key female characters to become rulers of the realm.
1250006341|5.0|Big fan so I love all the books. This one I especially like. Really get to know everyone. Nobody does it better than Downton and for me I love The Dowager Miss Maggie Smith
B008602KQI|5.0|I preferred the book, and wished the movie had followed the storyline here better than it did. Overall, I would recommend both.
B00005ASIL|5.0|This is a great Best of Tull.<br />It's one disk, but is loaded with great hit songs.<br />Get this if you like Jethro Tull.<br />You'll love it as well.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|Took forever to download and install, and then it won't even play! Crashes every time I try to run it. I uninstalled the game and downloaded/installed a second time ... same problem! Please fix this game asap as it is broken. I just basically paid you for nothing.
B000002GBJ|5.0|I love this album.<br />I used to listen to this vinyl record album all the time<br />in the 70's.<br />If you like Electric Light Orchestra and Jethro Tull,<br />you love this as well. Cheers
1423140605|5.0|Teaching 5th and 6th graders, I am always looking for good books to spark the love of reading. The kids love this series.
B002N5N4M6|3.0|I love this TV series !<br />I have the first and second seasons and I'm very happy with them.<br />But this season set I received is some how missing episodes 13 to 16 out of a total of 20.<br />It's weird because it's labeled as a 3 disk set and all of them are there.<br />I sure would like to see those missing episodes. This is an odd set.<br />The vendor in Texas is a great one. I've ordered from them several times before.<br />Always happy with them. Don't know what happened here.<br />But I will certainly get the next couple seasons sometime, even if it's from<br />the great vendor in Texas. I don't know how they could have known that there<br />are missing episodes. The disks themselves are in GREAT used condition.<br />I always buy used music and movie disks and this is the first glitch I've had.<br />These disks are in excellent condition - and play perfectly.
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|The best way to describe this final installment of SVM, Dead Ever After, is like a final episode of a TV series.<br /><br />All the characters (in this case, living characters) of past and present episodes are there to make a cameo appearance, some just a mention in a sentence, some have 'speaking' roles. In other words, its a way to farewell and cheer your favourite characters, and boo and hiss at the baddies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this final episode gets a little lost. It doesn't read like it was written with the same enthusiasm as the previous installments ,or perhaps the same author (just saying) and frankly it just didn't leave me with a warm and fuzzy feeling you should expect in a final installment, instead it was more of a 'What the....? When's the real book going to start?'<br /><br />Frankly, DEA reads as it if was a chore, like ironing. (but if I wear a jumper all day, I just have to iron the collar, right?)<br /><br />A shakespearian ending it is - It's a tragedy.<br /><br />It's a tragedy the way it was written. It's a tragedy the message coming through was that the author just didn't care. It's a tragedy I can't get my money back.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is self explanatory &quot;temple run&quot;.Dodging trees,fire,and the occasional trip over broken roof all because you stole an idol
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love time travel and i love cut the rope! I just wish each level had as many missions as the other 2 games
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Was a good series when started but getting too many. As an older gamer seems too much repetition of the same function.
B001FQIWSK|5.0|Visually stunning, The Fall may be one if the most beautiful and most gut wrenching movies I've ever seen. Lee Pace is a master. Catinca Untaru's performance had me laughing and crying within the same breath. I'm confused as to why this movie is not more well known or more critically acclaimed than it is.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Very good for keeping up to date on things of interest and pricing changes. Have had good luck with all phones used on.
B00942G4UA|5.0|This documentary was a real eye-opener.  The general public should know how inhumane our &#34;food&#34; animals are treated.  It might make us think twice before eating them. It did for me.  I am not a vegetarian, but since watching this video, I eat a whole lot less meat than I used to.
1932907009|5.0|I'm not a screenwriter, I'm a novelist, and I tell you, this book has shed some light on so many things that I was aware of, but most times fobbed off. Everybody has their own process and there is never just one right way to plot a story, but this made me realize how much easier life would be if I followed a few hard plotting rules.<br /><br />I want a whole wall dedicated to THE BOARD. Don't know what I'm talking about? Then read this book. You'll save yourself a lifetime of unnecessary rewrites.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app but where is the way to end it?<br />Silly why these companies  make always running apps that suck up juice on devices.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Good game so far but it keeps reminding me to review before I am done so I am giving it four stars instead of five.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Too much emphasis on spending money in order to play. Could almost work on the lower levels, but eventually it costs too much for land and it's a bore.
B00263HWM8|5.0|Great quality! I hope that prices go down on movie rentals so that I no longer have to go the Redbox for movies.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|Well written and cogent. Helps givers understand themselves. Takers,matchers and givers are have traits of each other. We can all become more giving.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|I found the story to be stupid. I got bored half way through. The only positive past was the author.
0345528581|5.0|All you really need is yourself to be fit. Great moves and technique, a grate change up to any exercise routine
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Touching, encouraging, funny and heartfelt. It is no wonder this is considered a classic. I will read it again for sure.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I almost passed on the opportunity to own this gem of a movie, but finally decided to take a chance on the team of Streisand and Rogan in a comedy. It wasn't a big risk, not with actors the caliber of Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogan. I loved this movie! I laughed throughout and even got misty eyed a time or two. The story was heart warming, the characters were loveable and the parent to grown child relationship evolution, all to familiar. I recommend this movie and encourage you all to take the time for a \\"road trip\\".
B008XG1X18|5.0|I guess the title should speak for itself. Me and my momma use it together and love it! I should thank Pinterest because it helped my mommas day idea and my momma loved it!
B003QSJDZQ|3.0|Rented this for my kids.  Both enjoyed it for a while, but the story loses oomph early on.  Overall okay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome cool fantastic my son loves this app you jump over trains duck under borders and unlock millions of characters. It is cool.
B0095P29EG|4.0|This is an excellent movie for anyone who is a fan of the Marvel comics and movies like I am, or just anyone who likes a good action/sci-fi film. If you haven't seen this movie yet then watch it now! Its sequel will be out this year!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is such a great series, If you loved the Hunger Games, you really need to read this. It's all about the new adventures of Katnis and Peta.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game is actually pretty fun. The bad thing is that it gets pretty expensive and its constantly not giving the prizes you earn and freezing!  Its getting to the point where I would consider a scam!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|It's really a very useful path for personal freedom and I think we should all have it near by all the time and read again a few pages frequently.  My daughter who is a psychologist, recommends The Four Agreements to her patients.
B002E01LL6|5.0|I really liked this movie.  It had a good story to it.  It was enjoyable to see a lot of Channing Tatum in it.  It had a surprise ending.  I will watch this movie again.
B00785P2QC|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about how I felt about this game but after I started getting more difficult goals I fell in love with trying to complete the nearly impossible tasks.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|This movie had a good story to it.  Channing Tatum and the other actors did a real good job of acting in this movie, and there was a lot of really great dancing too.  I will watch this movie again and again.
B0094M2SCI|5.0|I have always enjoyed these Underworld movies since I am a little bit of a horror and science fiction nut anyway so I really like these movies.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a very fun game and om nom is so cute it's incredibly fun. I also like the original cut the rope and cut the rope time travel
B001VTTRC6|5.0|Great movie--compelling story--great acting. The cast is excellent. The dichotomy between Tim Robbins & Sean Penn is fascinating.  Highly recommended
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hope she comes out with another book to let us know about how their family is. I have fell in love with these people.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Steven King at his most imaginative & best.  The movie is absolutely compelling.  Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are great.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I have almost every temple run temple run oz, original ,the 2 one  any way awesome games keep making games
B000TU16GS|5.0|The book was really good and violent. It was really just a great book to read. So I give it 5 stars.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Here on Earth. DDL *IS* Lincoln! Like EVERY *OTHER* \\"Classic\\" Film, the cast is superb! The script is OUTSTANDING and the cinematography is GREAT! \\"Papa Day\\" LIVES (not just in the eyes of Tad!)
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Beautiful album. I love every song. This is an album I listen to top to bottom. I hope she has a long career. This is overdue.
B005LAII94|3.0|If you never read the book, this movie might be alright.  Like maybe 3 stars.<br /><br />If you DID read the book, you'll probably think even less of it.  And I know that's common.  Fans of books often hate adaptations.  But this one is especially egregious.<br /><br />But I'm not reviewing this as an adaptation.  I'm just reviewing it as a film.  And as a film it's pretty dull, the acting is not good from the leads, it's ultimately forgettable, but it really LOOKS great and is filmed well.  So I guess that's something.<br /><br />Oliver Stone used to be a great story teller.  Or maybe he just got lucky a few times.  Platoon is great.  JFK is entertaining--though insane.  I love Wall Street.  I even kind of like The Doors.  Most everything else ranges from \\"awful\\" (Alexander) to \\"interesting mess\\" (Wall Street 2, Natural Born Killers, W., Any Given Sunday, etc).  I think Savages falls in that second group.  But maybe I'm being kind.<br /><br />First off, the casting is stupid.  The best performances come from Del Toro and Hayek--who only have supporting rolls.  The leads are awful.  Lively is like a wooden Paltrow.  I like Friday Night Lights, but unless Taylor Kitsch is talking about Texas football and drinking beer, he generally comes off about as convincing as a cigar store statue.  Aaron Taylor is just not good.<br /><br />And then there's a tone.  \\"Show, don't tell\\" is what good story tellers are supposed to do.  Apparently Stone isn't interested in that.  So he gives us a narrator, a ton of exposition, and even a \\"twist\\" ending that's stupid.<br /><br />Those willing to forgive Stone for the plot may think he's held to the source material.  But that's not really the case.  In the book, the storytelling is light and breezy.  Stone goes for heavy-handed and sentimental.  In the book, O. is a vapid material girl.  Here, she's just a whiny captive.  Chon is as 2 dimensional as characters get.  And Ben is some generic movie hippie from central casting.  Everythingabout this movie takes a book that is light and cool and fast-paced and turns it into some kind of melodrama with action...and if I wanted to see that, I'd plant myself on the couch and labor through Michael Mann's \\"Heat\\" for 7 hours...because at least it's entertaining.
0385737955|4.0|This is a good book, one I'd definitely recommend to science-fiction fans.<br />Plot: 5/5 Mysterious and exciting, well developed and enjoyable.<br />Character: 4/5 Good, believable characters but not very fleshed out with emotions rather handled rather heavy-handedly at times.<br />Setting: 5/5 Perfect.<br />Writing style: 3/5 This book is very clean, which I really appreciate since clean sci-fi is hard to come by. That said, he uses a lot of slang and doesn't do the best job of it at times.<br />Total: 17/20 A worthwhile read, something I'd recommend if you like this sort of book, but probably not one that would change your mind about sci-fi if you're not already a fan. It's clean and reasonably well done.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very riveting story.  Could not put the book down.  Well written.  I recommend it for people of all ages. A continuation would be great.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|My favorite show right now.  I've got my daughter watching it as well.  Will be sad to see it end.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Very disappointed with the last book. Did not like the plot of the book, nor ending for the characters roles. It did not seem like much work was put into wrapping it all up. Over all, very upsetting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play it all the time.It is so fun!!They always upgrade the places.first your in Rome then Japan.the game is so awesome that I play it everyday
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What a great story. I couldn't stop reading it. It pulled me in from the beginning. What a great heartwarming love story. It's a must read
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|the game is cool but I don't like that the energy downy go up unless you get a new power plant
0345529057|4.0|From the other reviews, I anticipated thin paper pages.  But, being an adult, I can turn them just fine without tearing them.  The books are the same as I've seen at the grocery store for more money, so the price is good.  Nice box to slide them back into and eventually pass on to a friend.  And, of course, I knew George R.R. Martin was a great spinner of tales.  I'm still on Book One, and have gone OMG a number of times.  Lots of surprises in the story; every chapter makes me want to read the next chapter.  So, I'm enjoying my escape into literature.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so amazing you n e ed to get it the best thing is that its free and that you can upgrade almost everything
B008OOYALE|5.0|most of the time I absolutely love the game. but every now and again when I'm trying to move something the screen will fly to somewhere else and then I wont be able to move my screen at all. its a little annoying but other than that I like the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is entertaining and interesting to play.The challenges and awards given keep the game fun to play wherever I am, at any time of day.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|The finale angered me. I hope there will be a sequel that makes up for it. I will keep an eye out for an excuse to continue buying the series.
B001LF347E|5.0|My friend loves this show, so I decided to get it for her birthday. She's watched it twice so far. Great show.
B000TTRGUE|5.0|Use every day. Get good reports on it. I use this for ham radio and it was a great surprise how good the quality was for so little money.
067144901X|5.0|We chose this after reading other reviews.  He is one year old and is learning sounds.  His parents were pleased
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it its on the go &cent;= play it a lot. so fun<br />I will get it on every device
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game I just think that there needs to be more coins but all around a good game
B001MBK3T4|4.0|Great album !! This is the beginning of all things Rock and Metal. I love Sabbath with Ozzy but Dio did a great job too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game. Had some trouble moving the &quot;pipe&quot; at first, but I think it was because I have a screen protector. Things seemed to have &quot;settled&quot; now and I haven't had any more problems. Really fun brain workout.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|While watching this you'll re-live memories of spaghetti westerns past.<br />It has it's Sam Peckinpaugh moments as well in the gunfight scenes.<br />A buddy movie, a revenge movie, a love story, and more.<br />Worthy of multiple viewings.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Orson deals with the human side of sicience fiction by describing the forces that influence human decision. Yur a drwan in by the characters plight and resolution.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Knowing the outcome in advance in no way prepares you for how they got there.<br />I was litterally on the edge of my seat for most of the movie, for once you get into it, you loose all track of time.<br />That's why I say it's a fast 2 1/2 hours<br />A must see.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is really fun. I enjoy playing it and the music makes it even better. cant wait to beat it.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I bought this to replace my old laserdisc copy wich had degraded.<br />This blu-ray edition brought out detail I didn't know was there.<br />Watching this you have to wonder if the writer was influenced by Tolkien.<br />Recommended.
B00012QM8G|5.0|i think this movie is a work of art and should be mandatory in all school when<br />learning about the second world war.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have trouble with print.  I have to get large print books at the library and sometimes I have to wait for the book to come back and on my tablet it makes it easier.
B0031RS44S|5.0|As always has a bit to keep the intellect going so an enjoyable read - I will keep going I expect
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have this app on my phone and it works good so far.  I am glad that it works on my Samsung.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Loved the retired Rebus on the cold case hunt. No real difference with his relationships with those in charge and his complicated connections with those on the wrong side of the law added complexity and interest to the story.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I have all my devices set up with Dropbox.  When I take a picture I send it to my dropbox and it is stored on my computer at home.  This is an invaluable app.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Kept me turning the pages all the way to the end. The character's come alive and make you cheer them on to succrss.
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|Never before has a soundtrack managed to so completely remove me from a movie experience. It's jarring. When you hear Jay-Z for the first time in the film, you are likely to miss the next 10 minutes because all you can think is ... really, Baz? This is just downright insulting.
B000GOWNPU|4.0|very good movie dealing with topics of child abuse and justice.  Adult roles could have had better casting, but overall a good movie.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have enjoyed this game for years and I'm so glad that it's available on my kindle fire. Thank you.
B001AJ09JW|5.0|If you like Horror films, this one is great.  Well written, acted, and filmed.  I've rented it several times over the years and finally decided to purchase it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|james bond at his best, pleanty of action to be seen, and the wemon are tipical bond wemon to boot
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|their best albums, although I love them all.  If you love &#34;club dance music&#34;, you'll love this group.  BTW &#34;Don't Feel Like Dancin'&#34; is destined to become a disco, dance club classic.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Did not expect this ending at all. This book kept my guessing the whole time. I couldn't put it down. I wanted to know if Jacob was guilty or not!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very good book couldn't put it down.  Can't wait till the next book comes out.  Until then I'm going to read another book from Day
0670026603|5.0|Could not put this book down from the moment I began. Character development of major and minor &#34;players&#34; was strong. Recommend this book highly.
B0047VSW30|4.0|I rented this after doing some late night reading which made mention of Hypatia's painful end at the hands of Alexandria's Christian ruler (I believe it was Augustus)<br /><br />I've wanted to see this film ever since the previews years ago but I'm glad I waited until I had some solid historical context from my reading, otherwise this would have been just some sword & sandal drama with ancient guys in robes jews and Christians all going at it. My hat's off the director for taking on such a richly complicated story set in an era most people know little about or do not grasp the significance of. I enjoyed the speed and depth of emotion carved out by different characters and the actors. I particularly enjoyed the quietly powerful and dashing Orestes character, without whom I believe Rachel Wesz's Hypatia would have been less intriguing and flat. some criticisms; I found the music to be a tad repetitive. not sure whether the filmmaker's budget in this area was restrained but the same track of a woman's wailing voice played over and over through so many scenes it became aggravating and cliche. some simple instrumental score or even more modern electronic mixing would have done the film more justice. secondly, I found the portrayal of jews & christians in this film sloppy. I would not go so far as anti-semitic because I think that's too severe. but the older jews who address Orestes could have come off a sketch comedy set. the Christianized jews were no better, with their middle eastern & Israeli accents, these were the most semitic looking of the bunch. it was a tad too caricatured and simplistic for my taste (yes I'm jewish) the 'new' jews vs the 'old' jews. casting and dialogue should have taken a different tone. lastly, the Davus slave character literally had the same mute expression on his face the entire time. I liked his face, I think most people would agree his performance was moving in its own right. but again, from an acting point of view it got tedious to see that sad scowl every time the camera panned over. lastly, the character of Hypatia was a mixed bag for me. I loved the lack of pretense (no makeup, no bulging cleavage or sexist feminine seductive stances) and yet at times the character looked and sounded like a simple schoolgirl. reaching up to the stars while laying on a pillow and confessing she'd never loved. I found this character diminished by the writer & director. her story, stature and role in the film was watered down to say the least. if anything she was a vehicle to summarize the cosmological and philosophical questions of the day, rather than a prominent mathematician and philosopher of great talent and renown who posed a serious threat to the new republic.<br /><br />Although fictionalized, I liked how they filmed her death. in reality she was taken by a group of men, dragged to a church and 'skinned alive' as one of the men in the movie suggests. no naked suffocation by a lifelong friend and would be lover. Hypatia's skin was scraped off bit by bit while she was fully conscious. if anything, the strength of this film is in showing how the roots of Christianity and the transfer of power from one civilization to another was rooted in mob mentality. the teachings of Jesus the healer/prophet vs the religion of his followers hundreds of years later could not have been more different. equating brutality with the word of god and his magnificence made the Christian faith one of brute force and violence, especially towards the jews who presented a constant problem theologically and culturally having been the 'chosen' ones who closely followed the word of god in their own book which far predated Christ. that many if not most were forced and brainwashed into converting, or had to trade spiritual guidance for unethical behavior shows the power hungry nature of this small sect turned world religion. lastly, what it shows so clearly and painfully is the Church's backwater thinking as well as disregard for the rule of law, science and freedom, not to mention its deep hatred of women. of course Hypatia was nothing more than a filthy pagan whore witch. like so many after her she was killed and tortured for holding steadfast to thousands of years worth of human exploration, medicine philosophy and a belief system rooted in the magic of nature and the universe - not some resurrected dead guy nailed to a cross.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I did not like this film.  I laughed maybe 5 times the entire movie-- and not that hard. But  someone else may like it.
193700788X|2.0|Wow.  I had really looked forward to this, the last in the Sookie Stackhouse series.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the previous novels and was hoping for the same level of satisfaction with this.  But alas - it was not to be.  I understand as the last novel in the series Harris needed to tie-up any loose ends and put story lines to rest, but this felt like a cop-out.  It was too neat and not at all plausible.  The plot lacked any real conflict or action.  The narrative lacked the energy of the rest of the series.  The characters seemed to lack the drive and motivation they had established in the previous novels; it was as if they too knew it was their last appearance.  It's sad, but even the quirky behaviors I had found so endearing in previous novels (i.e. Sookie's naivete and astonishment at supe behavior; Sookie's constant referral to her way dead gran) were just irritating and annoying. Instead of finding her slightly refreshing and \\"girlish\\", I found myself questioning her stupidity.  After existing for so long in the supe world I would have thought she had at least a working knowledge of how precarious life can become when one socializes with the supes. But no.  I now regard her as I do Jason - the slightly slow but lovable family member who will do whatever you ask. Ordinarily I would have been thrilled that she and Sam finally realized they had a \\"thing\\", but this too felt contrived.  At the end, I just felt like Harris was going through the motions and doing this because it is such a popular series, rather than out of some loyalty to the characters and the residents of Bon Temps.
B000050HTO|5.0|What's to say? One of the greatest singer songwriters of our time, this album brings together some of his most memorable works.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It starts slow but stick with it and you'll be rewarded with a great story.  If you have already seen the movie, it is still worth your time to read the book.  We read the book first and noticed many story changes in the movie.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. High quality entertainment at a price you can't beat... FREE! I have been playing this game for a few days and no trouble as of yet. If you're looking for a fun game to while away a lunch break or waiting at an appointment then this will definitely keep you busy and having fun.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|This is my kind of movie. realistic fight scenes, good plot, delivers on action and entertainment. very well worth your time.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|omg i love this app the pets are so cute i cant stop playing i love it that all I really have to say
B006FLGBGA|3.0|This is one of the better storylines/plots for the Planet of the Apes franchise, but the amount of computer generated animation made it seem more like a cartoon than an actual movie. The acting was ok, and for the most part the movie was entertaining. The ending however bordered on the absurd, so be prepared.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I really felt as if charlaine was just ready to be done. Also, I'm mad I wasted the money on this book, if I could get a refund I would. When I read book 12 I didn't really care much for it but I was invested in the series so I saw it out. I'm bummed I did and wish I would have read the reviews, but I preordered the book, lesson learned. I have read all of the sequel books as well. I don't want to ruin it for anyone so read it if you must. Good luck, but I'm pretty sure I won't be buying anything else that CH writes. I'm not trying to be rude but I have invested a lot of time and money in the series. I was just truly bummed to say the least.
B009NY43NY|1.0|First, I stopped buying the hardcovers the second they came out, waiting instead for the paperbacks and debating whether they were worth the eight bucks.Then, when the last one came out, I didn't finish it, since it felt tedious and forced.Now, I read the reviews of the final book and I might get it from the library,but probably not...I stopped watching True Blood after season 3 (incredibly,unbelievably poor writing---I don't blame the actors). I guess the \\"synergy\\" was bad for Charlaine Harris,too. She'll take the money and run, but she ought to be woman enough to face her disappointed fans,without whining and feeling sorry for herself. She was pretty happy to accept their adulation and money: face the music now.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Movie was ok. It wasn't great. There were a few intense action scenes. Overall the movie was good. I was hoping for a better thrill.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I prefer a game that has some sort of challenge but this game was way to easy. Young kids might like.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's awesome so far. Just started playing but I'm enjoying the various items and rooms available. Finding based on picture instead of words. Inventive and challenging
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Excellent trilogy!  If you like sci-fi, philosophy, politics, and stories of &#34;the one,&#34; you will find this an interesting and unique read.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Hilarious - a story that is poignant and heartbreaking mixed with comedic scenes that bring the big belly laughs. It is a peephole into an Ireland that has biases and real neighbors. McCloone survives a horrific childhood to find what he yearns for in the end.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|This thing is a waste of money. It's bulky, and I honesty don't care if it clips to the stroller... My diaper bag clips to my stroller and guess what, I can take wipes out of my diaper bag when I need them. Also it does not stay closed and even if it is closed, I found that my wipes were drying out in it. Let me save you first time moms some trouble... A ziplock bag makes an excellent &#34;wipes case&#34;. This is another one of those baby products that you don't really need.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I have always been a Star Trek fan. I started when they had the series on tv. I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a awesome game to play on kindle that is because i am play ing it on a Kindle
B00081U7HC|5.0|It is a great rags to riches story. The wonderful music enhances the story line with  that Roy Orbison vocal range.  Always a fun move to watch and re-watch.
B00BIVN82M|1.0|I was deeply disappointed in this CD.  I could barely get thru it. I have enjoyed most of Mr. Buble's music but this \\"style\\" was not at all him.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very interesting and well done episodes.  Recommend seeing Season 1 first.  Wonderful acting by everyone.  If you like soaps this will be well worth your time.  I enjoyed it immensely.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I always enjoyed minecraft since it was released but there is nothing fun on here. you can even grow crops and the world is so tiny! chests and your inventory is annoying as hell to use and nearly Impossible to find resources! There isn't an online play either just LAN and if you ever find someone who might have 7 bucks to waste on this game then you are very very lucky. I highly recommend to play Survivalcraft. First of that game is the opposite of everything I said above except there isn't online play.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love this one more then the last. Its in heavy rotation. Especially Gorilla! Bruno Mars music always seems to fit my moods.
B008602KQI|1.0|In spite of its many favorable reviews, I was bored by this tired tale of humans hunting humans for entertainment.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Not sure who will be reading this but I guess it breaks down into two groups.  People who have read the books, but not seen the HBO series, and people who have not read the books or watched the series.  This is must have for both groups.  I got the digital version of the show as part of my blu-ray purchase.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The series is definitely worth investing time in.  Just make sure to read thru in a reasonable amount of time as there are so many characters and plots...  Excellent series!
193700788X|1.0|I've read these books as a way to give my mind  a break from reading. I don't see why so many people are complaining. This is the standard Sookie fare. They're all one star books. One's as good as another. They require ZERO thought to read. \\"Can I offer you a (tee hee) bottle of blood?\\" I mean...King of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Nevada? Really? It ain't Shakespeare, folks.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|If you like world building games, then you are in luck with this one. So far, it is very enjoyable and I am learning about animals in the wild.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|great read. Kept me busy for many sleepless nights.<br /><br />must use more words. seven more words required to end this review!
B004MPESSY|1.0|There are some favorable reviews of this film and, after looking at it, I don't agree with any of them - and that's by the proverbial country mile.  I kept waiting for something to redeem the movie. Never saw it. This is sex, violence and revenge at their lowest level.  The acting is substandard as are all \\"production values\\" (I use that term loosely).  Do your mind and soul a favor.  Watch almost anything else but this piece of trash.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soo much fun.... I think its better than Temple run. so I rate it a five. haha. Go subway suffers!!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Yes, I was disappointed with the ending. But more than that, I was let down by the lack of closure with Sookie, and other beloved characters. I don't even know what else to say....
B009NY43NY|4.0|Even though I would've loved to see Sookie end up with someone else, Mrs Harris did a great job of ending her series with what Sookie would've wanted. I'm sad this is the last book but enjoyed it from beginning to end!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Spoiler: different from the show on hbo.the ending is completely different. Bran and rickon separate as they depart from winterfell.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game ever it is so much fun I would recommend this game to anyone it does not go slow well so far for me but I would still recommend it to anybody
B009NY43NY|4.0|I must say that I was a Sookie fan BEFORE TB. And the show and the books really are completely different. I suspect many reviewers are TB fans, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />The book was a return to Sookie past for me. The last 3 books prior have been absolutely dreadful; I don't even believe CH actually wrote one of them.<br /><br />DEA brings us back full circle, with many old characters coming back for a (sometimes) quick cameo. This helped build suspense as to which guy would emerge as Sookie's HEA. Ultimately, I suffered a &#34;well duh&#34; moment with her &#34;love&#34; choice. It was always him, we just always wanted her with our fave guy. I don't want to spoil too much, so vague.<br /><br />I did feel that the antagonists and their reasons for their anti-Sookie behavior a little contrived, so I can't give it 5 stars. I have dreaded this book and attempted to drag out its reading, fearful of being disappointed. I must say that while I was sad to say goodbye to Bon Temps, I did feel a sense of completion and happy peace with the way we parted.<br /><br />Thank you CH for a beautiful series. I have really enjoyed the ride.
B0076DELIG|3.0|The first half is kind of boring. Other than that it was OK. Its time for him to get a good story going.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Though the author is obviously a great fan of Lincoln, it's not difficult to quickly become absorbed in the times and politics of that era.  It sheds light on the workings of a great cabinet with multiple strong personalities and egos.  How Lincoln was able to meld them into a true team is remarkable.  I truly believe this president was the only man in American history who could have held the union together.  How he was able to make use of each cabinet member's skills and his ability to remain focused on holding this country together is amazing.  He better than anyone understood the repercussions that would have ensued had the confederacy been allowed to go it's own way.  His management and timing and his underappreciated sense of the American people and their will is inspiring.  Anyone else would have rushed the emancipation proclamation before the American people were ready. It makes you wonder if the almighty himself didn't hand pick President Lincoln to lead us through these difficult and pivotal times in our history.  It was a great read and though the subjects are well known to history, the book reads like a best selling novel.
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|Maiden England is a great live show and an incredible setlist. The History of Iron Maiden documentaries that have been on some of the previous releases, though, are the biggest draws for me. Incredibly informative, often funny, and always entertaining. I have to say I felt a little let down by the History documentary for the Somewhere In Time/Seventh Son era. We got an entire standalone documentary for the Powerslave/Live After Death stuff, but here it feels as though they were really trying to rush through a time period that encompasses nearly 4 years of history, all condensed into a measly 40 minutes.<br /><br />Maybe I'm biased because Somewhere In Time is one of my all-time favorite records, but it just feels like this set got particularly short changed. I hope this trend doesn't continue when we get into the 90's stuff, because I'm sure that's where a LOT of the juiciest stuff will be.
B003G4W49C|5.0|There's a bit of childish vulgarity \\"hey fart face you bastard,\\" but other than that it's pretty good.  I don't know what the other reviewers meant when they said \\"it's not really scifi\\" the whole thing is scifi from start to finish.  Loved it.  It's a classic for sure.  Like the Harry Potter of the 80's or like To Kill A Mockingbird.
B00337KM2S|5.0|Ver slick, very organised...combines good ole times with modern technologies by exposing flaws on both sides. Unusual ending, not the usual thing one would expect. Can't tell more not to give more away, definitely worthwhile watching several times in one's life time.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Really enjoyed this novel. It had a hard time putting it down.  I really got into the suspense of it !
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I first read this book after seeing the original Foot Loose movie. I enjoyed it even then, at about the age of 14, as much as I still enjoy it today. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as reading for those under about 14-16 years of age, as it can be a bit violent and graphic. Much younger than the teen age group, and the reader would likely not be able to grasp a lot of the imagery. Even reading it again just a couple years ago, it was still a good read for me. It's hard to find writers of this caliber today.
B008GJV19Q|5.0|A great basis for a movie about free spirits changing a conservative village in France.  While a bit predictable, a nice story nonetheless.
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|This book was quite enjoyable to read. Well written and put into terminology that the average reader can understand easily, to include the more scientific parts of the writer's journey. I gave it 4 stars only because it wasn't completely what most reviews and other information laid it out to be. However, still a very fun read!
B00280LYHS|5.0|It's the perfect end to the perfect series!!!!!!! Rick Riordan is pure guineas to have thought up this book. Sad yet hopeful with some romance and alot of action. Still it has humour mixed in. It made me want to cry and laugh and go crazy all at once. I hope all will enjoy this book.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|its very fun but it can glitch alot. and now it wont even load to let me play fix this s*** now!!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I really enjoyed this film, it had a story line that was well pieced together.  It was a slightly dark comedy as well as being romantic.  Therefore it held my interest better than most romantic comedy type movies.  I like that their world was anything but perfect.  That's life.
193700788X|3.0|I think it ended exactly how I anticipated the series to end. I don't get all the hate for Ms. Harris though, these were her characters to write and for fans to be as upset as I've seen on multiple sites, is just sad. There were plenty of people who were upset when Stephanie Meyer put Edward and Bella together instead of Jacob and Bella, but I have never seen so much vitriol for an author.<br /><br />The book had way too many story line wrap ups of characters that no one really cared about or had forgotten, but I guess that's part of it being The Southern Vampire Mysteries series, there had to be some kind of trouble for Sookie. I also get the impression that maybe the author should have wrapped up this series a few books ago, she almost seemed bored of the whole thing in this book, as I had said about her two previous books.<br /><br />I was satisfied with the ending, but I would recommend waiting for the paperback version as I don't think it was worth the hard cover price.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I recently downloaded this on our Kindle Fire HD because I have a few large reference books (legitimately!) stored as PDFs, and I just couldn't live without the bookmark and search features which seem to be absent from the Kindle's native PDF reader.<br /><br />However, I discovered that the performance of a search on a light tablet like the Kindle, as opposed to a PC, is prohibitively slow in the large (500+ page) documents where I tried to use it.  I tried to search a phrase that I knew appeared exactly as typed in a document, but the Kindle fell asleep trying to find it, and I had to wake it up and kill Reader.  It would probably be fine in smaller documents, but in this usage the app failed to meet expectations.<br /><br />For general reading, the Adobe Reader is noticeably slower than the native reader, but not so much that it gets in the way.  Adobe Reader presents three options for layout: continuous feed, single-page (like the native reader), and \\"text reflow\\", which tries to simulate the pure-text mode of the Kindle's book viewer.  Again, this third mode would probably work better on documents that are purely textual, but for anything with a complex layout, the app got terribly confused.  Unless you hate single-page view for some personal reason, stick with it, as it seems to give the best performance.<br /><br />Still, the addition of navigation by bookmarks puts the Adobe Reader head and shoulders above the native Kindle reader for large documents, as long as the PDF documents themselves contain good ToCs and/or bookmarks.  For large reference books (including textbooks, roleplaying game source material, etc.) there is no better way to get around, and the Kindle's native PDF reader simply doesn't provide it.<br /><br />Another minor advantage over the Kindle's native reader is that Adobe Reader supports internal document links.  The Kindle's reader will underline links for you, to show you that they're present, but won't follow them if you try to click onthem.  The Adobe Reader highlights document links with a contrasting background, and as long as you zoom in close enough for it to recognize your tap as \\"follow this link\\" instead of \\"bring up menus\\", it will jump to the link's destination.  It's a bit clunky, but it is an additional navigational aid you don't get with the native reader, which only teases you with its possibility.<br /><br />So, the TL;DR version: Get Adobe Reader if you need to navigate large documents or books-as-PDF; for smaller documents, the Kindle's native reader may serve your needs better.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|If I hadn't got my KindleFire HD for free from my bank I wouldn't have bought one. Why are there hardly any free games for it? Amazon should just give them away for free to everyone since they're obviously making a killing on the apps.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I never tire of reading Nicholas Sparks books. This kept me interested from cover to cover. Can't wait to start another.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|The band Walk Off The Earth is composed of a group of extremely creative and multi-talented Canadian musicians.  My teenaged daughter first introduced them to me about a year ago when their cover of Gotye's \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" became a Youtube sensation (I recommend that you check out the video b/c, imo, it's awesome - and a great introduction to the band!).  Their Gotye cover is included on the R.E.V.O. CD along with 10 new songs.  All of the songs are infectious and they will be \\"stuck in your head\\" all day long.  Walk Off The Earth is a \\"real\\" band - they write most of their own songs, compose their own music, and play a wide variety of instruments - and use them in very creative ways.  Their vocals are fantastic and their harmonies are heavenly.  I know I'm gushing, but that's how excited I am about this band - they really are that good!  I would list and discuss specific standout tracks but, for me, they are all standout tracks.  R.E.V.O. is one of those rare albums where every song is a gem and it is very easy to listen to this album from beginning to end without skipping any of the songs.  If pressed for a favorite, however, I would have to choose \\"Summer Vibe\\" at this time because, for me, it is the quintessential summertime feel good song (check out the video version if you also want to hear the ocean waves in the background - it's a brilliant piece of work, imo).  R.E.V.O. is currently my favorite new album and WOTE, as they are also known, is my favorite current band.  I listen to a lot of music and I haven't heard anything this good in a long time.  So do yourself a favor and spend that $10 on R.E.V.O - I think you will be very happy that you did.

B009EP3DJM|2.0|I liked Ke$ha first time I hear Tick Tok.It was catchy but I was scared to get the album Animal got I read reviews and it got slammed.People were talking like Ke$ha would not go far releasing a album full of garbage.But I heard Animal and decided to give it a try.I liked it.Songs were catchy,not badly written in my opinion and for a debut album,was pretty good.<br /><br />Her second album(or a hold over album some called it) Cannibal was good as well and had me wanting more.Kinda like Animal.Just a short version.<br /><br />When Ke$ha released Die Young off Warrior,i liked it.Catchy and sounded like it was something from Animal.I read the reviews on Warrior and everyone raved how the album was her best.It was better produced,songs were written better,more grown up,mature.<br /><br />Well I didnt get any of that.It sounds poorly produced,songs sound the same,not very mature at all.Sorry,but when I hear a woman say \\"Suck my(man part\\",I just find that gross.A lot of the lyrics just seem to run together thru out the songs.Kinda like filler lyrics.And I am Sorry.But everyone seems to love the song Dirty Love with Iggy Pop.Hello,Iggy is old enough to be her grandfather and the I cant get the images out of my head.I am sure she could have found someone else who is younger to do this song instead of a beat up old man.And I am sure that will piss Iggy fans off.No offense to Iggy.I think he is a great performer and artist but I just having a hard time picturing a young 26 bi female lusting over 66 year old man.<br /><br />It is a okay album and has some good songs on it but not nearly as good as Animal was.And I would have actually gave this album 3 stars but I could not do it with Dirty Love on it.So is not good anyway but to choose Iggy Pop with so much more younger talent out there just blows me away.I just can help but wonder what Iggy watches on his computer now.

B004QK5N5W|4.0|This adapter allows me to hook up my iPad 2 to my 42&#34; inch HDMI TV, and it works flawlessly. I like the extra tab that allows me to charge the iPad while it is playing, so I don't ever have to worry about having the iPad battery charged when I want to watch something on short notice.<br /><br />My advice to iPad users who like me don't have cable TV - get this adapter and the PBS app. You won't ever have to worry about missing a current episode of Downtown Abbey or Call The Midwife on the night they are showing. You can simply watch them with the iPad on your big TV whenever you want, thanks to this adapter!

(well it made me happy) But if you are looking for an exciting book or something adventurous you should not read the Secret Garden.

Definitely not a page turner, but its cute and fun for someone who needs something to read and has a bit of time.

B000002JSJ|4.0|'Presence' was Zeppelin's 7th studio album, recorded in Munich in just two weeks in November 1975 and released on 31 March 1976. Initial sales were slow (for a Zeppelin album) and it's less well known than their earlier releases but nevertheless contains some outstanding music spiced with a couple of Zeppelin all-time classics.<br /><br />This was fundamentally Jimmy Page's project, and it shows. The band had to cancel a major tour in August 1975 because Robert Plant suffered a serious car crash whilst on holiday with his family on the Greek island of Rhodes and was still wheelchair-bound at the time of recording in November. Page's compositional work dominates the action with multiply over-tracked, high-energy guitar patterns leading the action on many of the songs.<br /><br />Two or three tracks stand out from the rest. The high-energy opener `Achilles last Stand' is acknowledged by just about everyone as the album's high-point and for some fans is their all-time favourite Zeppelin track. Here the band is on top form with a fast, syncopated rhythm anchoring the frenzied interweaving guitar patterns, Plant's vocal line sitting on top of the action to produce an effect almost other-worldly and transformational. No other rock song has ever sounded quite like this: if you've never heard it, play it loud on a quality sound system and you'll be left awe-struck and breathless. Other highlights are the delightful `Nobody's Fault but Mine' (wherein Plant returns to harmonica playing) and the closer, a long laconic blues number titled `Tea for One' which captures the life of loneliness Plant always felt on the road away from his family and has some of the most restrained and inventive blues guitar lines Page ever laid down.<br /><br />There are no acoustic/folk numbers among the album's 7 tracks, but nevertheless the overall result feels finely balanced and `just right.'<br /><br />Page originally thought to title the album `Thanksgiving' but decided instead on `Presence' because it expressed something the band felt attended them; that despite difficult times, they were an unbreakable unit and could still weave musical magic together. The artwork, though original in that quirky archaic style so characteristic of Zeppelin, has never been a hit with fans - though like the music, it's like nothing else created before or since.<br /><br />In summary: perhaps not Zeppelin's `greatest' or `best' album but pretty good overall, with a couple of outstanding tracks and probably the most imaginative and creative guitar work Jimmy Page ever recorded.ecause it expressed something the band felt attended them; that despite difficult times, they were an unbreakable unit and could still weave musical magic together.

B000002JSP|4.0|Zeppelin's 8th and final studio album was recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm in the final weeks of 1978 and released in August 1979, just over a year before Bonzo's death brought about the demise of the band. ITtOD is usually seen as a `transitional' album with a character all its own.<br /><br />As `Presence' was Jimmy Page's project, it's John Paul Jones who really shines on ITtOD with many of the writing credits shared with Plant, and JPJ's keyboard work and arrangements drive much of the action. Robert Plant said at the time: \\"'Hey hey mama say the way you move' didn't really have a great deal of import any more. `In Through The Out Door' is more conscientious and less animal\\".<br /><br />The opener, `In the Evening', sounds like it should have appeared on the `Houses of the Holy' album, such is the similarity in style. The one issue with this track is that Plant's vocals are too far back in the mix, and the production might have been improved. `Fool in the Rain' is real top 20 material and has received endless airplay on US radio stations. `Carousalambra' is a great track, probably the most ambitious on the album.<br /><br />`All my love' is dedicated to Plant's deceased son. A surprisingly energetic and upbeat composition with JPJ adding some fine synthesizer work, it's one of only two songs ever recorded by the band where Page has no writing credits (the other one is `South Bound Suarez' again on this album).<br /><br />The star track for me is the closer `I'm gonna crawl'; a classic long, slow blues number in the mode of `Since I've been loving you' and `Tea for one'. In Zeppelin's 11-year stellar career Plant has rarely been heard on better form than here: surely no other white European singer ever captured the blues with such power, such mastery of the dynamics, such feeling. It's here too that Jimmy Page emerges to produce wailing blues guitar lines to perfectly complement Plant's awesome performance in the unique conversational style the pair had made their own.<br /><br />ITtOD sees Zeppelin developing and moving on, and JPJ coming into his own as a composer and arranger. Had Bonzo been able to keep his booze habit under control and continued living and breathing, and had the band continued to compose and perform throughout the 1980s, ITtOD indicates the probable direction the music would have taken.<br /><br />The album artwork was designed by Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis (who did such a great job with artwork for Pink Floyd during this period): an unusual concept whereby the album was sold in a sealed plain buff sleeve like a bootleg, inside of which was one of six different possible cover designs each showing a different pair of photos of a scene in The Absynthe Bar in New Orleans. If water was applied to the artwork, it permanently changed colour and you never knew in advance how it would look. In 1980 it was nominated for - but didn't win - a grammy for Best Album Package.e their own.<br /><br />ITtOD sees Zeppelin developing and moving on, and JPJ coming into his own as a composer and arranger.

B0095GSKDE|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a way of writing that almost feels like a magic trick. He pulls you in with intricate stories and then spins out the complicated web of how they came to be, leaving you in awe at both his ability to spread the information and at the actual findings. I had to read Outliers for my English class and at first I thought it was going to be extremely tedious, but I ended up liking the book more than I thought I would.  In this book, Gladwell digs into the strange stories of unique opportunities, cultural legacies, and the importance of a birthdate that lead to success. It is a fascinating ride that had me gobbling up chapter after chapter and left me wondering about the successes of my own generation and what is yet to come.
B002BE7JEI|5.0|When I first read Misery, I was in love! I was very excited to learn that there was a movie version, especially one that is staring Kathy Bates. I was more than pleased with the movie. Even if there were some changes in the movie, (the hobbling scene, the rat scene, and the lawnmower scene), I still enjoyed it very much. I would recommend this to any Stephen King fan out there. Not to mention the price is absolutely wonderful. The special feature's are great, they offer more than most special features do. Also, the Blu-ray is fantastic! You can see every 'COCKA-DOODIE' hair on Annie's head!

B009NY43NY|1.0|Regardless of what some people believe, most poor reviews are not based on readers' disappointment in Sookie's HEA.  In fact, it really isn't clear if there is a true HEA.  The poor reviews are a result of reasons already stated by many, and there is no point in restating them again since I agree with them.  The series we once loved started a downhill slide since about the seventh book.  Hoping the next one would be better than the last, I purchased every one, only to be disappointed again.  Dead Ever After was the final nail in the coffin.  The characters are practically unrecognizable and unlikeable.  Never have I seen beloved characters so reduced by the author who created them.  For those who think the fans and readers don't deserve to have an opinion or criticize the books, when readers invest their money in the books we have earned the write to have and voice an opinion.
B00138H44S|5.0|I'm not good at reviewing albums, so forgive me.<br /><br />This is an album that every bass player AND every music lover should check out. I promise you will love it. Jaco was an original in the true sense of the word. He created a way of playing the bass guitar that can only be compared to the great guitarists such as Roy Buchanan, Chet Atkins, BB King, Jimi Hendrix, and others I can't think of at the moment.<br /><br />He proved how beautiful the bass guitar can sound.<br /><br />This is a beautiful album from beginning to end.<br /><br />GET IT! :-)
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|PICTURE QUALITY:  STUNNING.  The color is vivid the details are clear.  Even simple interior shots.  The steely determination, frustration and eventually world weariness in Peter O'Toole's deep blue eyes are what make this entire movie.  In this restored version you can his eyes as windows to the soul in laser-like focus.  There's one very minor scene where Omar Sharif's character is chided for trying to learn English from a children's book.  The small book is briefly shown on part of the screen in another actor's hands.  You can read all of the text quite easily on both pages.<br /><br />THE STORY:  It's long and it starts slow.  It's not made for folks that want immediate \\"run from the explosion\\" type action but when something happens it has more depth and human gravitas.  The first time through (years ago) I couldn't get past the halfway mark.  Now I find myself kind of fascinated by this story:  this guy who for awhile \\"goes native\\", who has all these crazy dreams and for awhile accomplishes the impossible.<br /><br />Lawrence is basically portrayed as a tactical and leadership genius and dreamer who is blind to the realities of serving two masters.  You see it everyday in the news and in human relationships - people are in denial of the deals they are cutting, promises made with themselves or others.<br /><br />There's a funny scene early in the movie when Lawrence is called into the office of the bigwig general and, upon marching in and presenting himself, Lawrence passive-aggressively salutes the general in a nervous, foppish manner.  (I presume because he doesn't respect pompous authority not earned by merit).  The general calls him on it and says something like:  \\"I can't tell if you're an idiot or if you have no manners!\\".  Lawrence backpedals, tries to smooth things: \\"Yes Sir, I have the same problem!\\"  and explains it as awkwardness and personal mannerisms.  The general then tells him to \\"Shut Up!\\"  Lawrence goes \\"Yes Sir\\" with this crap eating grin andfaux obsequiousness.  The contradictions between what's going on inside and outside of him in that scene are hilarious.<br /><br />There are many good scenes in this movie.<br /><br />My advice:  Watch it over two nights.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  Techno garbage you can skip:  I have a Sony BDP-790 BR player, LG 60\\" 1080p Plasma, Pioneer VSX-1021 receiver, Def Tech center, Panasonic everything else speakers & sub.
1401235417|5.0|This book is the first half of the court of owls story line and manages to do a rare thing, introduce a new element in the batman time line that feels like its been there all along.
1449410243|4.0|I gifted this & it elicited lots of giggles. Not your a-typical hyper-academic coffee table material. Lots of visuals and great for cat-lovers.

0307877523|5.0|I learned a few things in this book.  What I learned made it easy to say no to yummy foods that I used to love and were dragging me down the road to diabetes and obesity.  For me (and a lot of other people) just saying \\"Eat less and exercise more\\" isn't helpful. I want to know why I gain fat on the diet the USDA recommends, and how I can find a diet and life style that fits both my body and my life style.  This book gave me enough information to make some wise choices, and I ended up going from 155 lbs to 148 lbs.  (I am 60 years old and 5'1\\")  That doesn't sound like much, but I also went from a very very tight size 12 to a slightly loose size 8, and I am talking jeans, not dresses. Now to be honest, just reading the book did not give me these results.  What gave me the results was taking the time to think about what I had read, coming up with a plan that I could live and be happy with, and sticking with it.  Also a lot of exercise.  I am a little less than nine weeks into my diet and plan.  One thing that helps me mightily is when I am sorely tempted to eat something that is not on my diet, I just ask myself,Do I want diabetes?  The desire fled so fast that I found it easy to diet.  Actually, I liked this book so much that I own both the paperback and the audio versions.  I found them that helpful.  Also, this book gave some good information and insight to keep the weight off after losing it.  After doing the yo-yo thing for decades, I really feel comfortable with knowing I have the skills and knowledge to easily keep the weight off.  I am confident that I  will be able to live the rest of my life  being able to physically do anything that I want, and believe me, that list is long.  The last thing I want to emphasize, and this is important, is that there is nothing special about me.  If I can do this, anyone can!  All I did was to take this information and tailored it to me and my lifestyle.  The information is flexible enough for you to take it and make it your own.  I have a long way to go, but I am not in a hurry, and I am pretty sure my blood sugar is within normal limits, and if I keep making wise decisions, I will never have to worry about getting alarming blood test results.  Read the book-you will be surprised at some of the facts, and astonished at others.  I'll not give them away.  Read the book.  You will be glad you did.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|Almost every record has a warp that distorts sound and a couple of bizarre skips.  Some have issues with the digital content, like a channel will simply cut out. I've never encountered a new record that was of as low quality as this set. NEVER buy these. Collect them from used record shops one at a time. It'll be about the same cost, and it'll be way more fun.
B0082XJGRK|2.0|Won't complain as vendor did say \\"Slightly worn\\" but almost 50% of the pages were dog-eared or folded back. I had to straighten out a lot of pages, then put the book into a press. It just struck me as the type of thing that could have been corrected before shipping if they wanted a higher rating. No biggie though. Book reads fine.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Not what I was expecting. This book does not read like the rest of the true blood series. I wont put in any spoilers but in my personal opinion as the final book in the series it just felt sloppy, kind of rushed and left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a lot of questions. I’m annoyed that I actually paid the amount that I did for this book.
B0026WNGBA|3.0|I am about a fifth of the way through the book, and I feel like he's spent most of that time telling me he's going to teach me something great about chi running, but I haven't learned anything new yet.  I feel like by now I should know something.  Also, this is really a very basic, beginners running book.  I'm by no means an expert, but if you can run 5-10 miles already, I'm not sure you'll find much useful in here.  I'm going to try to finish getting through it, but I'm not too impressed yet, which is disappointing.  I was looking forward to some new lessons on how to improve my runs, and I'm not confident I will that at this point.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great when your on the go. It helps me stay connected with my family, friends and my customers. Thank You
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Perhaps because I never spent time in this country, I felt like I was reading a Grimm's fairytale.  The character descriptions were most vivid of the exaggerated depictions - lovingly written. But a bit cartoon-ish.  Cute story - I was longing for a happy ending.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The only thing I wish this game did, was when there are no more moves to be made, it lets you know like some of the other solitaire games.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It is THE cutest game with lps me lm a lps fanatic I have 100 of pet's and I play with them every day
B004SBX112|5.0|I chose this game as i had gone through all levels of the first one, and i was addicted enough that i needed more! I was not disappointed by this purchase!! It is going to take some time to get through the levels as they are not simply a repeat of the first game! I love the new backgrounds and the same old feud between the pigs and the birds. I never thought i would like this game in the first place, but i was hooked soon after i slung my first bird! i don't think anyone will be disappointed when they purchase this sequel to the beloved Angry Birds!
B0053O89WY|5.0|Exactly what I wanted and at a great price. The set arrived quick and wrapped up safely in bubble wrap. My set was brand new and still wrapped in plastic wrap. Definitely satisfied! Now I'm waiting on the release of season 6 and I would definitely purchase again from my seller.
B008K8H9C6|5.0|This game gets tough right away! It is going to take a long time for me to go through the levels, now, i'm not the brightest crayon in the box, but, it is tough! I think most will be intrigued by the amount of re tries it takes to get each scene set up just right. I love the simplicity and the unadorned quality of the scenes that take place in the garage, or the yard. Sometimes there is too much background distraction to deal within other games, but this game is attractive in what it doesn't have to offer there!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|\\"Coin Dozer\\" is a fun way to kill some time.<br /><br />A bit of skill is involved in aiming the coins, but not so much that the player has to be wide awake when playing.  This characteristic makes the game ideal for my early morning commute, before I am completely awake.<br /><br />The coins regenerate while you're off line.  The higher your level, the faster the coins regenerate.  The coins don't regenerate if you have extras in the bank,but when that happens, you'll probably find you don't need them, anyway. After a while, I had tens of thousands of coins available in the bank.  If you're willing to be patient, you can play forever without having to invest any real money.  In the beginning, the game generates coins a little too slowly for my taste.  After about a month of occasionally playing this game during my commute, I had so many coins and so many prizes that the game became too easy, and I lost interest.  This app is interesting enough that I'll keep it, download it from the cloud in about six months and start over.<br /><br />The thing I found most interesting was collecting the pieces of the puzzles and the game tokens.<br /><br />I loved playing this at the arcade in Las Vegas.  This is much less expensive, especially since I downloaded it for free.
193700788X|1.0|As a devoted fan of Sookie, I was really disappointed with how this series ended. DEA was a serious departure from the rest of the series.  It had an entirely different tone and style. The use of the omniscient point of view disrupted the flow of the story and was often pointless because it detracted rather than added to the story.<br /><br />For a book that is touted as a mystery, there was barely any mystery or plot. Most of the story felt like a parade of people from Sookie's past. Many of these returning characters did not drive the plot forward. A large amount of page time (more than in the previous books) was devoted to Sookie's everyday activities, while some important elements of the story did not have enough time devoted to them. Also, there were several issues with continuity. Many of these continuity errors were employed because it was the only way to make the ending work, which shows how poorly constructed the plot was.<br /><br />This story strongly emphasized that normal is good. Along with being normal, it's important to be a good, moral Christian. The themes in the prior books of tolerance and acceptance have disappeared.  Apparently, being different is bad if you want to embrace it, but it's acceptable to be different if you are willing to act normal (i.e. put up a front and pretend to be someone you are not).<br /><br />What happened to the Sookie I know and love? Now she is bitter and detached. Some of these emotions can be attributed to the difficult situations she was going through. However she's been through worse situations and managed to remain herself, so it's not clear what brought on this sudden change of character. Although Sookie's character changed in DEA, there was not adequate character development. She never learned to stand up for herself or to take an active role in having a better future. If anything, her character devolved into a hateful person who settled for what she was given.<br /><br />*******spoilers********<br />Sookie didnot end up with the suitor of my preference, and that would have been okay if the relationship progression had been believable. It's hard to believe Sookie is happy with Sam at the end because she has thoughts about several men in this book. Sookie appears emotionally needy when her thoughts jump from man to man. I never wanted to read a story about a woman who needs a man to bolster her self-esteem. She is technically alone at the end, but she is only okay with that because she knows Sam is there waiting for her. Sookie does not appear to love Sam. It was like they both decided being together was the practical choice for both of them since they so desperately want to appear normal.<br /><br />This ending does not instill the idea that Sookie is a strong, confident or independent woman. I don't think her ending was truly a happy one. All I know is I do not like the new Sookie, and I will not miss her.
6304779356|5.0|This is what I was looking for. Thanks for getting it to me quick. I will be watching this one tonight. lol.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I really didn't like it because it was to complicated and I really just didn't need it  I disliked it
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of the best movies out there.Truly a classic and so very well done. Totally worth seeing more than once!
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you're a Led Zeppelin fan, new or old, this dvd won't disappoint.  The sound quality and picture quality is great!  If your dvd system is juiced up with stereo your neighbors won't be disappointed either.  It is the best live performance of their young career, in my opinion.
B00008PW2D|3.0|I really can't give a full review of this because I bought it for my sister as a gift. I was pre-owned(which she did'nt mind)and it plays like new.
0765325950|5.0|When Robert Jordan died, I got rid of all my Wheel of Time books, discouraged and angry that I had to leave a this beloved series unfinished. Then my second son told me that some young writer I never heard of was going to finish the series. I checked into this writer, read all his books and over the next five years, read the last three books in the Wheel of Time series, which were written by him. He helped me to repent and today I own all 14 books in the series. Truly this magnificent effort was a labor of love.<br /><br />I am not claiming that Brandon Sanderson is a better writer than Robert Jordan, but may I put forth the following allegory to clarify what I am saying? Reading the final three books written by Sanderson, books 12, 13 and 14 (A Memory of Light) is akin to one master story teller sitting down after book 11, and another master story teller standing up and completing this incredible tale. Style differences yes, and even a different approach on how to introduce action, but the same rich, nuanced characters inhabiting the same complex world completing what they were intended to do. I plan on reading this whole series again in a year or two to dwell on what the jam-packed action sequences allowed me to miss as I turned pages too fast to catch everything this last time.
B002APU580|5.0|I'm not a romantic as in, everything ends Happily Forever After. This movie was down to earth with no modern &#34;fairy-tales&#34;. This was modern and believable, with just a hint of modern day &#34;reality.&#34; Love is never perfect,.love is earned, as in this gripping tale of daydream idealism and finally the forlorn love succumbed, to being, love is surreal,.live life elated, live prosperous, move forward! Aaaahhhwwe, if only.......
B009NY43NY|5.0|Love  the parting words. Sookie ha  always  been an inspiring  character but this last chapter as  moving and awe worthy.  Must read. Though I wish there would have  been more of Eric and Alcide.
B003THJA1G|5.0|Great mix of drama and Comedy.  The show knows when to be funny and when to stop for more dramatic moments.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I downloaded based on the great reviews.  The kids enjoyed it for about 10 minutes and now I HAVE TWO KINDLES THAT HAVE CRASHED AND CAN NO LONGER BE RESTARTED!!  Have no idea how to fix this but I guess I'll learn.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because its fun not stupid or gay this game is fun I would play this game all day :)<br />\\"fun \\"
1558908846|5.0|One of the best SciFi DVDes made. Stallone is at the top of his acting game! Recommend to all DVD lovers!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Been thinking a lot about the next life and what the meaning of it all is.  There are an awful lot of physicians and gifted scientists who are also men (and women) of faith - the two aren't mutually exclusive!  They, however, aren't the ones who usually write about such things and it was refreshing to hear a NEUROSURGEON on the subject!
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|It's really fun, definitely worth 99 cents! Best game I've bought so far! Lots of replay value and customization options.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|This a good product and it works quite fast.  I did realize after I bought it that there are places that scan picture quickly and save them in a digital format.  This is faster for us.
B000GCFO0S|4.0|I enjoyed the movie for what it was, but being a fan of the games and the original this one fell a little flat. You could tell that is some cases they tried to hard to make it scary, and it ended up being cheesy, but I did enjoy the story line. I had no issues with the shipping or the packaging... both were great!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I didn't realize that there were such things as Orphan Trains.  Was well written and and easy read. I would recommend this book to family and friends.
B0083Z614S|4.0|It's a good book. I liked it. Children need love and care of and raise in good environment. I think parents should read this book for having another view point to raise their kids.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|My daughter loves this movie.  I on the other had found it to be just OK.  The case it typical.  We do like the multiple copies so we can watch it on our Blu Ray and DVD Players.  We also can watch it on our iPod Touches with the ultra violet version.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|First of all the tutorial is way to long, its hard, it takes forever to load, and it takes 1.3 GB of space, and the download takes a long time, all adding to say that this game is just pure bad.<br /><br />Pros:<br />&bull;It has good multiplayer connectivity<br />&bull;It has cool heroes and monsters you can play with<br />&bull;There aren't many things you buy with real money<br />&bull;You can chat with people during the game<br />&bull;You are on a team with other people<br />&bull;You can go offline<br />&bull;You can play single player against the computer<br /><br />Cons:<br />&bull;Takes forever to load<br />&bull;Super slow download<br />&bull;Takes up over a GB of space<br />&bull;Is really challenging<br />&bull;You have to wait to come back to life before your back in the game, and you wait about 1 minute<br />&bull;It has a odd concept<br />&bull;It is just not fun at all<br />&bull;The customer support is horrible<br /><br />Overall this game really isn't worth because in the end you'll probably delete it like me.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I have always like Meg Ryan, and pairing her with Kevin Kline was a good match for this movie.  It is a cute movie about someone who loses her fiance, tries to win him back and in the mean time finds love.  Highly recommend this movie.  I am a little sad this did not come in Blu Ray, but it works really well on my Blu Ray Player.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app its easy and fast. Its no problem! You should download this app you'll love it like i did!! :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent book... hard to put down. Be prepared to loose some sleep because you will want to keep reading. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. I haven't yet read Colleen Hoover's other books, but this was superb.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this Is a good game for people<br /> that like games like temple run 1 & 2 and angry granny.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Great book better then the show I can't wait to read the next one amazing book devoutly read it.<br />Yae
B00COGY2P2|2.0|I can only review the first hour of \\"Jack Reacher,\\" not because of problems streaming the movie from Amazon, although the screen went blank twice during the first hour and I had to shut down and restart both times, but because the movie is pathetic. The writing style tries to imitate \\"Dirty Harry,\\" but falls short of even the worst Chuck Norris flick, as does the acting. At the end of the first hour Cruise and his co-star, Rosamund Pike, with newly exposed cleavage, are standing in a room looking out into the windows of the building next door at a bunch of people working at their desks. It's at that point that Cruise starts pontificating on the meaning of life and also the point where I had to turn the thing off. The movie, and Cruise, take themselves way too seriously and neither has the wit or the intelligence to pull it off. And, not to make fun of Cruise's height (5' 7\\"), but it's hard to take someone seriously who has to look up at all of the supporting actors, including the female lead (5' 9\\"). I'm a fan of most of Cruise's movies, but this one just doesn't cut it.
B00AO686G0|5.0|Who framed Roger Rabbit was a great movie when it was first released and now it just as good if not better on the 25 anniversary addition
1400095204|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was a well written story of the biafran war. Loved it loved it.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|A little repetitive but addictive. I enjoy it. I'm sure it will be a good time killer. I recommend it to any one with the space as its just under a gig.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Very enjoyable movie with excellent acting, a very interesting story line, and fantastic special effects. The high quality of the first three movies continues on with this addition to the series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but the only thing i don't like is that it kind of copied temple run. Every thing else is good.
B005LAII80|4.0|Only bought this due to recommendation of a friend. Even so, didn't have very high expectations for this remake, but was pleasantly surprised. Karl Urban did a great job as Dredd.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Like the title says, it is a very fun and addicting but when u put the coins in front of the &quot;dozer&quot;, it takes a while for the coin to finally appear. But other than that, it is an awesome game! And I am NOT deleting this app!! :)
B004H1YH66|5.0|Have always loved the soundtrack for Conan the Barbarian, which is perhaps one of the best movie soundtracks of all time in my opinion. This edition does add more than enough value to warrant the purchase price, even if you already own the original soundtrack. Very glad that I stumbled across this by accident.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Love the sorcerer`s ring books. Always so good you can't put it down!!! Each one gets more exciting!!!! Such a good read.
0385349947|5.0|If you are a woman, it will help you understand how you don't need to sacrifice who you are to get ahead in a corporate environment. If you are a man, it will help you understand how to work with women and identify ways to help women in a corporate environment (because you want to do it or because you are a manager, why it's not important).
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game can't get enough of it if you like iron man and temple run and shooting this is for you. Lots of suits to unlock three types have there on attack its really cool and everyday you fight a boss to get more of the power money total worth the time and best of all it is free even tho I'd say it be worth buying to
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game!!! add me cool667<br />:)!!!!! so this game used to b boring with no goals!!!  now more goals!!!  I play it offten!!!<br />love it!!!!!<br />:)

B007YQ9MWK|5.0|You get almost eight hours of Vivaldi for eight dollars, performed by the English Concert and Trevor Pinnock. Need I say more? For those who need more convincing, I will add that this MP3 album introduced me to some lovely Vivaldi concertos I was not familiar with. I like the tempo that Pinnock chooses for his performances of known works, and sometimes you see them in a new light. Virtuoso execution throughout.
193700788X|4.0|I am astonished by all of the disappointment I am seeing here.  I liked the book enough to read it through on the same day that it arrived.  Okay, so Sookie does not end up with a vampire.  And?  She grew up in these books.  She found a way to declare that she could stand on her own two feet regardless of boyfriends, supernatural conundrums or even kidnappings.  So, she went warm over cold-blooded - that's okay.  Harris told the story her way, I was engaged the whole way through and felt really satisfied when she tied up the various loose ends.  I hope that you guys will stop going bananas over this - it is entirely uncool.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|This book had a lot of things going for and yet inky mind still lacked something. Perhaps in the books to follow a little more of what is missing will be revealed. If you like dystopian stories this is a good read.
B008G12ERC|4.0|This is my first CD I have bought from Muse. I really like it, especially the hit song &#34;Madness&#34;. I'll get more of their music.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is really fun I just can not figure out how to add friends I would reccomend this app for anyone who is in love horses and or owns them
193700788X|5.0|I wouldn't have thought it could be done but she pulled all the story threads that she had been weaving together into a finished edge.  The finish is something I wanted to see happen several books back and the last sentence of the book is perfect.
B0006B2A42|5.0|One of the classic movies of spy vs. spy in the cold war, one of my all time favorite movies.<br />One of the great all-star cast's, unfortunately I think they have all since passed on so there wont be another movie like this one again.<br />The basic plot is that an american spy satellite crashes in the artic and the opposing forces (Russians and NATO) race to retrieve the information that was recorded on it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I found that I  enjoyed this game. I like doing these kind of games. The plot was cool and I liked it immensely. I will no doubt Hang onto it and play it along the way.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|Very difficult to navigate the car with both controls.  Using the joystick feature is a little better than the tilt.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved it & can't wait to watch all of the episodes. As soon as I finish Season 2, I will move on to season 3 if it is available.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Well done app and totally free if you have the patience. Otherwise ur free to spend to aquire more sooner. Only problem i have w/the design is rapid tapping can sometimes cost you the $ u earn. Makes it easy to spend by mistake which could possibly be happening on purpose to get you to spend more quickly. Other than that its a great game and am very surprised that more people haven't experienced what its all about yet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I live this game it is sooooooo fun I love the fact that tu can play mobs or no mobs so you build up your home and weapons. this game is one of the best games ever
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Awesome photo editor for the price! Even though this may be a tad basic it offers great quick photo editing options for everyone.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|this game is not very good in the beginig it is very hard to understand and even after that it is very stupid I hate it it got deleted of my kindle fire immediately this game sucks
B009NY43NY|2.0|I'm left feeling that this book especially being the big series closer was anticlimactic . I would have loved to see Sookie tell Eric off. The story has good potential but that's all evening that would have made it really great instead of a 2.5 stars was just not there. Even Sooky and Sam finally getting together! That's something that has been coming for years and the author managed to make that pale and boring as well. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. One more thing I don't it being ridiculous that to find out how everyone actually ends up we have to not only wait but also purchase a separate book. Don't most authors tie up these loose ends in the last book of the series???
B00104W8T6|5.0|I loved how quickly I received the product.<br />I recommend it to anyone who likes alternative music with a classic but unique twist.<br />I chose a five-star rating because I was completely happy.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Excellent book. Extremely well written-reads like a novel. An accounting of early Silicon Valley with unusual incite. Highly recommend this book.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I loved how quickly I received the product.<br />I recommend it to any one who likes country.<br />I chose a five-star rating because I was completely happy.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|Probably the best part about this movie is the songs Madonna contributed to the movie. &#34;Look of Love&#34;, &#34;Causing a Commotion&#34;, and &#34;Who's that Girl&#34; supplement the movie perfectly. I admit the acting on her part is not the best, but it fits her cooky character in the film. It's meant to be a screwball comedy that doesnt take itself too seriously.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I have not read any of Lee Child books before and evidently he has written a series of Jack Reacher novels.  Movie was very good murder mystery and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Tom Cruise nails the character.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Everyone should see this movie - it's truly amazing. Christian Bale is a brilliant actor. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat for an unbelievable ending.
0316172324|3.0|this book is alright but for the price I got I should have waited for them to get a better deal.
0007466064|5.0|I don't even know how many years I waited for this book to be released and then I couldn't find it anywhere. I finally found it on Amazon and it was worth the wait! I can't wait for book 6 and 7!!!

1416955070|1.0|If the author had been forced to leave out clichés and tired metaphors, the book could easily have been 100 pages shorter. The storyline was remarkably predictable with too much time spent on teenage angst. Most of the dialogue between the so-called teens was unnecessary (and occasionally repetitive). The ages of the characters was laughably inappropriate. 15-year-olds who hang out in coffee shops doing emo poetry reads in between their time partying at clubs? I was repeatedly struck by the feeling that the author had written a book about adults in their 20s (which would have felt authentic) but been told to make it into a YA novel.  One stop with the Find and Replace function and oila! She had ridiculously unbelievable teenagers in order to sale her novel!  It had all the predictable Hollywood morality - the teens spent most of their time pondering sex and cigarettes, having conversations that were irrelevant, and (predictably) one was gay and struggling to come out of the closet to his otherworldly parents! As I type, It was an onerous read full of predictability and new-age morality. I'm offended that any editor thought this was worthy of a book jacket (but not surprised that Hollywood jumped all over it)!

B00C10N3EW|5.0|If you're a fan of Joe Bonamassa, or just guitar in general, grab this baby now!  It's amazing how well all of his songs(even the rockers) translate from electric to acoustic.  2 more hours of live Joe.  Don't miss out!
B008WCP2PG|1.0|This disappointing movie was downright lame, drivel and cheesy.  It had a poor story line, the acting was dire.  There was nothing much going for it.  Perhaps some nudity would have helped a little.  According to the makers of this film women go wild watching a bunch of fit men dry humping on stage.
1423140591|5.0|I am eternally, completely in love with the Percy Jackson books. Before The Lost Hero came out, I thought I could only be loyal to the original series. But this spinoff has caught my heart, and already has me begging for the third installment-which won't come out until the fall of 2012. Why must Rick Riordan do this to me? These books are so addictive, it's hard  to crave the next one.<br /><br />While I did love the first book in the Heroes of Olympus series, with its introduction of several new characters, I definitely missed Percy. Fans who were angry at his very noticeable absence, fear not! The Son of Neptune made the wait worthwhile, because I realized how much I'd missed him and the funny quips he added to every scene. Not that the other characters were lacking in that, either. Frank and Hazel added to the humorous side of the book, which has always been one of my favorite things. The book had me laughing so hard, I nearly cried!<br /><br />And once I was finished, I was tempted to pick it up and read it again. It's one of those books I feel you can read a dozen times and still love it and get something new out of it. For all the anticipation built up over waiting between release dates, this one was definitely worth it. Filled with fantastical settings, strange allies, ugly enemies, and a Pillow Pet with a horrible fate, The Son of Neptune was a great read, and is one of my favorite books. All fans of Percy Jackson or the Heroes of Olympus will not be disappointed! Anyone who hasn't read these books yet, please do! The mix of mythology and the modern day is something you shouldn't miss. I give it 5/5 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Love how you can learn to kind of take care of a horse through this game. But I wish that everything wouldn't be so expensive and that you could get gems easier
B0064MGU98|5.0|I really enjoy watching it. Every episode is better than the last....  And i Can't wait to finish all the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awsome. Always look for minecraft stuff and buy poker edition. This game is worth 5 or 6 bucks. GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0078ZTWP4|2.0|This lantern works great except for the fact that it has an led blinking light that you cannot turn off unless you take out the batteries.  I decided to leave the batteries in the unit and after about a weeks time the batteries were dead.<br />Purchase a solar/wind up powered unit, I purchased one later and it works great!
B005UKJZ10|1.0|What a waste of time this was. From the opening nothing happened. No plot. Went nowhere. Lots of pretty video.<br />I know, its artsy, I like artsy. But I want a movie that entertains, too. This one was just boring.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|JT brought good music back with this! I don't care for Suit & Tie but the rest of the album is GREAT!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|One of those great movies that has plenty of adult humor that would go right over the heads of my kids.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I never thought I would like any of these &#34;Super hero&#34; movies, but after my son gave me his copy of Ironman II, I had to watch the original.  There is a great plot, and sub-plot, and the acting is very good.  Jeff Brydges plays an excellent - and surprising roll - but I don't want to give it away.  Even if you're an &#34;adult&#34; like I am, give it a try!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|The Anker Uspeed USB 3.0 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Network Adapter works great with my Surface Pro! I haven't had any issues with it.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Good graphics, story a bit slow changing sceens, but not as bad as some. I would rcommend this game to others.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've had the mouse for a few months. Held back my review to have some experience with it.<br /><br />I had to adjust to the shape and feel coming from a Logitech MX 518. Took a few days to become comfortable<br />but it wasn't a really painful transition.<br /><br />The mouse isn't put together with the same kind of quality control as a Logitech. The fitment and placement are slightly less than stellar, but in no way does it feel cheap... just a little rough around the edges so to speak.<br /><br />The software/driver install was easy. No glitches. The programming of the buttons and the DPI were painless, all functions as well as it should. I have had zero issues.<br /><br />In 15 years of PC gaming, Logitech while being the \\"number 1\\" manufacturer of control mechanisms.... has NEVER had drivers as solid as what I've experienced with the Anker.<br /><br />Buttons feel great. The feet are nice and wide... accuracy is awesome.<br /><br />Nothing bad to say about it at all. Highly recommended.

B002N5N4M6|4.0|I was a big &#34;Two and a Half Men&#34; fan but now I think I'll be a &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; fan. I love the DVD's and the service (price and estimated delivery) was fantastic and on time.
