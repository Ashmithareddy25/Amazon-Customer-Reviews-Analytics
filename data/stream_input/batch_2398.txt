B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great Quality of sound at a much cheaper price than retail at other stores. I recommend this product to others that want good sound coming thru.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Watching this on my IPAD with streaming videio was great.  I could watch and enjoy while my husband watched his shows.<br />The actors in the show are suberb .  I now plan on watching all of the seasons and catching up to the current show.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I've been playing this game for a while and just uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it will alleviate the crashes. More to come later.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I started this series after falling in live with the HBO version. My husband and I found it on On Demand and watched season one on a rainy weekend. As all fifty thousand reviewers have said before me, the books do not follow the t.v series exactly. That's ok. I don't think I have ever read a book then watched a movie that was the same. The movie probably wouldn't make a lot of sense to those who only watched the movie if it followed it exactly.  In a book you learn about the characters from a different perspective, their thoughts and feelings, childhood and family histories are shared so that you understand a choice or decision that character makes.<br />Anyway, back to rating the written books, the first 3 books in the series were amazing! The characters are so well written i felt each of their challenges and triumphs unlike any other series I have read.  I actually felt like yelling He!! Yeah a couple of times.<br />The fourth book of this series was not as exciting to get through. The author leaves out half of the major players in the first three novels so he can focus on telling the stories of a few, Samwell, Brienne, Arya, Jaime and Cersei. a few others but not many. You read the thousand or so pages only getting the story of the events with those characters. It moves but you're like, ? What's happening with Jon? Where is Dany?  . When you are finished with the fourth novel, you need to purchase the fifth to get the other half of the story. I just started the fifth novel and realize i am still at the beginning of the fourth novel. not sure this was necessary, I would have bought the fifth book regardless, I love the series and want to know what happens next.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|It is so hard to stop myself from watching just &#34;one more episode&#34;.  First couple of seasons were great.  Season three's direction seems to be changing the direction of the show, so we will see if I change the number of stars by the time I finish it up.
1442359315|5.0|I love his viewpoint of NDE.  It's completely unique, and uplifting.  Brings new life to the idea of Heaven and God's love for us.
B00005QGAZ|2.0|I wished that Amazon would have let me \\"preview\\" the songs on the CD.  I would not have ordered it.  I'm not a big fan of Michael Jackson<br />but thought for the high reviews the price I would try it.  Just wasted $7.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Thank you, Brandon, I think you've done him proud! It's been an epic ride, and I'll no doubt start from they beginning again in the not too distant future.
B00361CAEE|5.0|great look into how the fashion world really works. The reality view of how the &#34;The Devil Wears Prada&#34; got it's look and story from.
B003GK2216|5.0|It would make a very good T.V Series  It is very well researched, and a delight to read. Highly recomended
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Even after 40+ yrs this show holds up. I was sick in bed and watched jj abrahms Star Trek loved it but wanted more classic trek. Watched the original and the drama and acting still hold up.
B002RZZIXU|5.0|I enjoyed this very much.  Not too complicated and had a very enjoyable plot.  A good entertaining book<br />I really would not hesitate to recommend this book.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|It's pretty nice, I really like how it is organized. In some ways, I find this better than the default music interface that my 10 inch Tablet comes with.
B00B6QXN56|2.0|High expectations were the killer here. I have come to expect the absolute best blues guitar music around from Joe Bonamassa and he has a habit of delivering. This album falls flat however. There are no flighty guitar solos or epic breakdowns and a lot of the solos are given to the other musicians. Even 'Woke up dreaming' one of my favorite songs (and one that Bonamassa plays acoustic when touring normally) lost its usual edge. Lots of strumming and lackluster guitar muddled with backing instruments that often take the fore. This is an average acoustic rock album at best. Just buy the electric albums and skip this one.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I wasn't really going to watch it, but decided to give it a try. Bought all episodes after i saw the first one.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Love action between Denzel and Chris. Action and Suspense keeps you on your edge and wondering what is next okay
B005544V6A|5.0|I wasn't really going to watch it, but decided to give it a try. Bought all episodes after i saw the first one.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I have netflix and saw Revenge Season 1 up to 22 eposides and wander what happen after they got on the plane. With the series I purchased it resolved some of my questions.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Awesome animation , such a creative take on childhood story figures. Great for kids and adults alike, would definitely recommend this movie
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Great book with an interesting concept just couldn't put it down. Highly recommended if you like psychological thrillers with lots of twists and turns.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love the way this book is written-in journal form. Great, easy read! I would recommend this book to friends.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I don't have time to do a long review. However, I did want to say quickly that this is one of the best HO adventure games I've ever played. Graphics, storyline, mini games, HO games, hint &amp; skip buttons...all are excellent! The game is also one of the larger games. A+++! Can't wait for a sequel!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book I'm speechless!! And can't wait to read the next one!! This is the first books I've read by sylvia day and I can't get enough of them!
0142421375|2.0|I don't think that this was correctly categorized....it is a children's Grisham book.  For a fan, I was looking for something for adults.
B009FZFONO|5.0|best show to ever hit the tv screen, it was definitely worth every single penny. i still have 5 words left.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|It was difficult watching the beginning but was worth watching the rest!! I absolutely enjoyed the rest of the movie.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|The acting was mediocre in this film but the story was engaging.  Matthew McConaughey can and has done better work.  It entertained.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|creative, well written and engrossing - a great read. with twists and turns that in one sense are far removed from our existing reality but in another hit very close to home. Very well done...
B003V2HWP0|5.0|Great love story from a period film.  This was just a chance that I would choose this film, not typically what I enjoy but it's the best film I have seen in a while.  Certainly worth your time if you need a little romance in your life-filmwise anyway.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I was excited about this release, but disappointed with the CD.  As soon as I put it in the player, I could tell the recording was muffled and muted - very poor mixing.  On a digital player, where I have never had issues before, the voice is fuzzy and the music overwhelms in volume and underwhelms in quality.  On top of the poor recording quality, the majority of the songs are down-beat depressing covers of mediocre songs.  This is not the typical upbeat, happy, well orchestrated Michael Buble album.  With the possible exception of the 2nd song, which I believe will be the only &#34;hit&#34; from this CD - It's a Beautiful Day.  If the rest of the album were even close to this song in spunk and upbeat presentation, the album would have been a homerun. Come on - Reese Witherspoon singing alto harmony behind Michael - and not very well at that.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|After see the film, I understand the award nominations and why.  Daniel Day Lewis did an outstanding job of acting this part.  I found the history and the strategies of politics and war fascinating.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|This movie is aging well - the Night Owl murders, Bud and Lynn, and Kevin Spacey's amazing job...*sigh*. It's a noir classic.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|My daughter loved it but I found the voices to be annoying--especially Sarah Silverman's character. I don't see this being a &#34;classic,&#34; like a lot of other Disney movies.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|It must have taken an significant amount of courage for a world class actress to carry this role but she did it with such normalcy that I was amazed.  I'm an even bigger fan and she should have gotten the Oscar.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Very well written. You get to know and care about the characters. Unlike some fantasy stories blood song has a subtle magic and romance. Too often I read a fantasy novel and everyone is throwing fireballs and lightning bolts or falling deeply and madly in love after the first meeting. Strong story with some twists. Sort of reminds me of a more violent  Patrick Rothfuss  Has a satisfying conclusion but leaves you wanting more. I look forward to the next installment.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Subtitles difficult to read against screen colors, dialect difficult for those who are not accustomed to this language.  Story was great, I would recommend it to others.
B004742Y68|5.0|I saw this movie as a kid in the theatre & while it scared me I loved it! So when I watched it again after many years it was still good & I think better than current movies (paranormal activity) & similar titles. I also an intrugued by the movie franchise history very interesting & unintentional film \\"gaffs\\" Look for in the beginning where the Dad comes home from work & takes the trash cans to the house... * you see a crew member grabbing the can !
B0090SI4LU|1.0|I have to be forgiving, at least slightly, since the book was Meyer's first foray into pop culture. The concept - aliens inhabiting humans in an effort to be peaceful and progressive rather than just annihilating us all - is creative and fresh. The idea that the human mind would remain behind and fight against the invading alien spirit is also pretty clever.<br /><br />That being said... those are my only compliments.<br /><br />The book and the movie are equally hokey and cheesy. The teen/college age heroine is so utterly overdone these days, it's beyond tired. The names are painfully corny (Melanie STRYDER? really??) and smack of junior high dreams of authoring a novel \\"when I grow up\\". The details are poorly thought out (these aliens have the technology to travel through space, but not to find humans hiding out??). The high school bully angst of the guys who dislike Wanderer/It/Melanie in the human colony is so one-dimensional. The gruff yet lovable, Jeff-Bridges-In-True-Grit-Wannabe role played by William Hurt is worthy of a faceplant. The cave set design... oh man, WHO designed this thing? Does anyone else think it even looks remotely like rock? The structure doesn't even attempt to be natural, there are straight walls, perfect corners, flat rock \\"benches\\"... it's like something out of a bad Land Of The Lost remake.<br /><br />I could go on, but hopefully you already realize what a waste of time this movie is. If you haven't read the book, don't bother, it doesn't redeem the movie at all.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is one of the most painful books I have ever read, leaving the details with me throughout the night. Knowing that this is not a novel and instead a memoir makes it all the more painful. Beah's language throughout the entire story made every single situation incredibly vivid; I felt as though I was watching a movie. His difficult journey is apparent from beginning to end, and allowed me to think a lot about the way the world works.<br /><br />After spending a few months studying globalization and feminization, I became more aware of the way these two terms appeared in a memoir such as Beah's. Knowing that the people of Sierra Leone had to endure so much with what seemed like such little help seemed unbelievable. I didn't understand why UNICEF hadn't reached these grounds faster or even how it worked for that matter. But later I realized that regardless of the action that finalized Beah leaving Sierra Leone, UNICEF was working all along to help this happen. And not only that, but everyone around the world that contributed monetary donations also helped. I believe this is the most powerful form of globalization seen in the memoir.<br /><br />Aside from that, from a feminist perspective, reading the way all of the child soldiers became desensitized made me realize the parallel between the young men's desensitization along with the young women's desensitization via rape. These young men and women were stripped of their innocence by both rebels and their own country's government.<br /><br />Although this horrific story may seem irrelevant to countries and people like us, it is still important to maintain an open understanding of how much our society can contribute to such causes. Do not think that just because Ishmael Beah was rescued by UNICEF years ago that there are no more people suffering from similar situations. We have a responsibility as a society to become aware of these circumstances and to find ways to help. This book is highly recommended for everyone and anyone who cares to have a deeper understanding of the situations hundreds of people have experienced, anyone who takes life for granted, and anyone who wishes to gain a more globalized perspective.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. It has the same features as the pc version. I enjoy it very much.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|We love this movie. It is so good, and it is much better that Brave that Pixar put out. I would recommend it to anyone that likes good movies even if you haven't played video games.
B008PPUMVY|5.0|I have always Loved this CD.<br />I lost the one that i had & its great to get this wonderful CD back in my collection.<br />.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved the movie.  Fun for the whole family.  Streamed without interruption. Great price. I could not be happier with this service through Amazon.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for to complete my friend's &#34;James Bond&#34; collection. DVD was &#34;original&#34; as advertised, sealed package. Shipment was prompt and price was reasonable.
B000GWE44U|2.0|It wouldn't play on my normal computer like all the other shows I purchased off Amazon. Took two hours to finally get it to work but it still buffered like hell. But I'm in a hot spot of internet so it shouldn't have done it.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Really enjoy this series on my kindle.  Watch any time I want. Free with amazon Prime membership. Check it out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you see the first season  just pay for the full 3rd season cause you cant just watch one episode you will need to watch them all.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|We watch the Jesse Stone movies and have read the books.  Very enjoyable.  The movies capture the books very well.
B00AIJP9BS|1.0|boy am I glad I had an anti-virus program installed! Dr.Web caught the 2 security threats as soon as it finished downloading. Bad!
B00628RVV0|4.0|This  is  a  great  Movie,  Although  like always  the  Books  are  better. Still  it  was very  well  made, sad  story.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|movie was stupid and boring and I would not recommend to anyone , a few people we have talked to agree
B0084670FU|2.0|very slow. very boring. actually thought about not finishing the movie. thats all i have to say about this movie.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|I listen to the whole CD over and over again. I think this is the first time EVER that I can say that I love the and listen to the whole thing. I bought it for song #8, still counting, but ended up loving every song. Great CD! I had to buy two, one for my house and one for my car.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Few shows move me like this one.  The anger, regret, sadness and empathy that I feel when watching these characters is limited to only a small handful of television.  First rate writing and acting.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm catching up on the first three seasons so I'll be ready for season 4.  Watched 1 and 2 through Amazon Prime.  Wish season 3 was available for free.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|First saw this when it first came to video. My mom, 80 at the time, had no interst at first. After the first 15 minutes - she was hooked. I've since seen it many times but finally decided to own it.
B0092MH8WA|5.0|The third in the American Series and it doesn't seem to be getting old or tired.  Great compilation of songs that suit JC's style.  He makes all these songs his, and the gravitas he instills in each song hits the soul in a very deep level.  RIP Johnny Cash, you are missed!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|As expected, this is an excellent album. I've been listening to it for three days straight! Keep up the good work Justin
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|...and the quality was amazing.  There was no lag time and the picture was awesome.  We've seen the movie before and own the dvd but the Wii was easier and we had not problems.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|As a former Philadelphian and Eagles fan I really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />I read book first then saw movie but either way the book is so different it is great reading. The movie was good but departed from the book's characters so much as to make them far different and a very different story. Much preferred the book which was a great read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I didn't think I would every be able to get into a British drama, but this show is very entertaining and does a great job of explaining things specific to the era and Britain.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Go America! Girl has gall! I can NOT wait for the next book. I laughed, I cried, I became angry, and I'm more than slightly suspicious of Aspen, but hopefully all is revealed in the next book! Hurry!!!!
030758836X|3.0|I enjoyed this book very much--the writing, the two alternating points of view--until I got to the end. And then I was infuriated. To bring the reader on this exciting ride full of twists and turns and then conclude with a contrived ridiculous ending only left me angry. Halfway into the novel, I had gushed \\"the best book I've read in a long while\\" to more than a few people. Next time, I'll finish the novel first. What happened? Seems like Ms. Flynn ran out of ideas, steam, or what?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can read what my friends have posted on Facebook but have not yet had time to totally figure out how to post and reply on my device. I highly recommend Facebook for keeping up with friends on a daily basis.
B00902S0IS|5.0|Saw this movie 5 times in the theater as a kid and the monster from the Id scared me each time but I loved it.  One of the best Science Fiction Movies ever.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love having this App. on my Kindle. I don't have a smart phone so I miss out on a lot of &#34;up to the min&#34; applications that make life easier. I carry my Kindle almost everywhere I go so this app is lovely for checking the weather in my area.
B00BF11STU|3.0|The first hour and forty five minutes covers the 12 years we looked for Bin Laden...it's ok...a little slow...hey...just watch the last 45 minutes.  That's where all the action is.  That part was really interesting
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Love, Love, Love being able to access the full Facebook site from my Kindle. I don't have a smart phone so the &#34;mobile&#34; app is just strange to me. I like what I know. This app is everything I could have hoped for to get the full site!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was great.  Interesting story and the puzzles really make you think! Glad I bought it!!  Will buy more if they are like this...Way to go!!!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|works very well. has headings for various search types. not bad for a &#34;mobile&#34; app. Will be keeping this app.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|I bought this years ago in VHS and of course, later on DVD. However, my twin girls scratched it up and so instead of buying a new Blu Ray, I just decided to purchase this on Amazon Instant and I have no regrets! No more scratched DVD or Blu Rays!
B008K8U13K|2.0|This game is the hardest game I ever played and I played a lot of games. For u sonic fans out there don't get hopes so high for this game because it keeps on glitching and the controls are always switching between tilt and touch . It also messed up my data. And this game is pretty much made for retro gamers. 1 more thing Sega u should make like an easy mode for all these beginners.
B00633W614|5.0|this series came highly recommended from two members of my book Club.  So I purchased the two books and I could not put them down.  I cannot wait for the third book to be released.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Amazing story.  It seemed surprisingly gripping and engrossing in considering the limited surroundings (yes I am aware of the irony).  The ending provides an unexpected and intriguing twist.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Having now read all three books I feel this was the better of the three books, developed the characters their lives and their problems.  I feel that after the first book she had help in writing the other two books so that the books had more plot and not just be an erotic essay.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great book  in the Jack Ryan genre, that hits close to world events. Sometimes I begin to wonder if Mr. Clancy is clarivoiant?<br />Has read every piece of Fiction Clancy has penned since the Cardinal of the Kremlin. Keep up the good work Tom!
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I thought this film was very distrubing.....<br /><br />Not much more I can say, except it was distrubing with the language and the violence!
B0079R9SOG|5.0|The product fits perfectly on my Pentax and allows a safe hold to the camera. To mount the camera on a tripod requires a little tweaking, nothing very complicated, though.<br />I believe it is a useful (and safe) addition to the product B-GRIP EVO Camera Belt.
B008220D5K|1.0|I had wanted to see this movie for some time, but was very disappointed in the language that is overused!! I don't consider myself a prude, but I think you can make a movie without every other word being the f word, ect....<br />I was not impressed!!
B0056FMNYA|5.0|I use it with my Pentax camera and I find very comfortable to have the camera kept along my body, and not perpendicular to it. There is a lock that prevents any accidental fall of the camera, and a quick release system. I found more comfortable to wear the supplied belt than to attach the system on my own belt. For security reasons, I suggest that you adapt a hand strap system to the camera (I bought the B-Grip hand strap plus from the same manufacturer) because you won't have a neck strap to keep your camera safe anymore.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|If you liked the Lord of the Ring series, you'll like this one too, I'm sure. This story takes place before the Lord of the Ring.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read this before reading the Shift pre-quell. I'm looking forward to Dust. If you haven't read any of the issues - just buy this compilation.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Wonderful movie because it was true.  Well done, so realistic and well acted.  Showed real survival acts.  The children in this movie were wonderful especially the oldest son.
B003XZ0WPM|3.0|Film was obviously designed to have a series of sequels that apparently will never be produced.<br /><br />The Amazon rental did not offer CC.  I have since looked at iTunes and Xbox Video which both offer the same movie at the same rental price but with CC.  Why Amazon?
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This is great game!<br />I love all PF games. If you have not played, please try. You will not disappointed.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Great product. Keeps me  connected to the goings on in my current business and my past occupation. Vivid and fluid app that I thought would take me a while to figure out but it is pretty user friendly.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The book was absolutely superb from start to finish...Follett does such a wonderful job of establishing a fictional relationship between his characters and the reader.  Ken Follett is without question one of the greatest writers of our time.
B0068THAGY|4.0|Thought it was a good movie, the young actors were really good and made a connection to the characters that they had to portray. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Sci-FI
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've read numerous booksfictional books about WW II and have enjoyed most but this one is without question my favorite.  Follett does an outstanding job of transitioning from Fall of Giants into this book.  The relationship established between the reader and his characters in Fall of Giants enables one to better comprehend the tragedies people of all nations endured.
B00608HMFW|5.0|I like horror movies and mysteries, and these supernatural series keep me watch them all the time. I will recomend them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Although I am not a fan of zombie or apocalypse themes, this show is really interesting. It exposes the reality of life and the choices we have to make for our own survival and the survival of our loved ones. Social skills are important in life even if it's during a terrible crisis. I fell in love with the characters, they make a really great team.
B00A655N8I|5.0|No, Gergiev doesn't whip up Hurricane Katrina in the opening moments, but his orchestra plays gloriously. It's refreshing to hear Wagner with those lovely Russian woodwinds, and Gergiev does a beautiful job of drawing out inner voices. Kaufmann can't be matched by any Wagnerian tenor currently signing today, and Stemme is an intensely moving Brunhilde. Can't wait to hear the next three installments.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I love hearing Blake Shelton sing. He's a great entertainer also. I enjoy his music very much. Hope to get more CD's in the future.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is another great book by Rick Riordan. I was sad to see this one end.  The good part is that he is publishing another book in fall.  I CAN'T WAIT! I'm going to try and get my dad to read this  series
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Django Unchained was an excellent mix of drama interlaced with humor. Definitely worth a second look at this pompous example of humor about racism in a fictional display of erudite humanity,,,,
B00BP4X3W2|4.0|A very moving movie. Knowing it actually happened keeps you engrosed.<br /><br />I liked the way the it ended adding another level of reality.
B009MF56GC|5.0|this movie awesome  alots of action fighting and shooting love it! I have part 1 and 2 will waiting for 3. very good movie
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Okay, so I usually don't cry over books, but this one had me sobbing. It was so beautiful and tear jerking, and I couldn't put it down.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's the best bingo game out there. I do wish they gave more credits because I have to let my daily credits build up for several days so I can play for an hour. That can be very frustrating.
044024367X|1.0|I'm not a huge Jack Reacher fan - I would say most of the novels are \\"3\\" stars, with a few rated higher and some lower.  But I have read all of them up to this point.  In my opinion, \\"Nothing To Lose\\" has been the weakest effort of all of the Jack Reacher novels.<br /><br />What I didn't like:  a very boring, bland villain; a very small geographic area - of which Reacher goes back and forth constantly, and every trip is written in painful detail; nonsensical actions by the \\"bad guys\\" to Reacher; and too many pages spent as a very boring travelogue.  The biggest thing I didn't like were Mr. Childs' personal anti-war views being espoused by Reacher.  It seemed very jarring and out of character.  If this is Reacher's new character development, and an indicator of where Mr. Childs wants to take the series, then I'm stopping here.
B004EERGHS|5.0|A great movie that will stand the test of time.  Both of them jumping in the river far below is my favorite scene,
B008JFUUQ2|1.0|I was not informed that it was a rental and it doesn't have any of the special features. Like the behind the scenes and whatnot.
B00009NQQO|5.0|We're a basketball-loving family. So what better toy for the baby than hoops for the tub.  Great fun for the baby and a net to store extra toys in between baths!
B0013LKFVO|2.0|Yet another negative review.  If you don't need a whole lot of light but want battery life its great.  Its significantly less bright that a std mag light bulb.  And that's considering the mag light isn't that bright in the first place.  Basically it will make your 3 d as bright as a AA mini.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|Some things  that are bad about this game is 1. you have to buy buildings and pets after the first hour to progress In the game. 2. It gets Boring fast since the mini game are the same ( there are three). The pets are cute and the graphics are good but if you want a time killer dont even bother with this game. This one unfortunately was added to my delete pile.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This movie touches your soul from beginning to end once you start you will never want to stop this movie this is an amazing movie
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Far-fetched stories and wink-wink mayhem abound.  It is fun to watch because the story lines are so ludicrous.  The acting is mediocre and one-dimensional, but that is exactly what is needed here.  I am sure that die-hard fans will disagree with my assessment, but this is not a bad thing--sometimes we just have to have something to amuse us that doesn't really have a huge point to make.  Each episode has some impossible occurrence with an even more impossible resolution, however, good always overcomes.  I would compare it to the old Saturday matinee cliff-hanger serial without the cliff-hanger.  Each episode appears to stand alone so that you don't really have to see them in order, nor do you have to have seen them all to understand what is going on.  A true guilty pleasure! Pass the popcorn, please.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|There is little to be said for this Kubrick classic that has not already been said so I will not belabor the facts already presented that prove this  is a magnificant piece of motion picture work.  The new Blu-ray format in which this offering is now presented along with additional features adds much to the home enjoyment this movie.  As one is generally unable to relive the excitement, frustration, anticipation, laughter coupled with fear offered by Dr. Strangelove in a large theatre venue, this product certainly offers the viewer the next best thing.  In my opinion, an absolute must for the private home motion picture collection.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I'm retired and consider myself to having been successful.  I just purchased this book because I like Mark Cuban and the price was right.  The principals shared in this reading material can help everyone in their personal lives, you don't have to have a business to utilize the great ideas Mr Cuban shared.<br /><br />GO Mav's, GO Shark Tank!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book has everything! Action , romance, suspense. If you liked the first two books you're gonna LOVE this one! I will not tell you anything about this fantastic book,except for one thing: WICKED is good.
B0094K1JPC|4.0|Yep....if you just want to lay back and enjoy a fun movie, then this is the one. Go ahead...rent it!
B00574Q7PQ|3.0|The movie was just ok and if it wasn't for Liam Neeson this would have been one or two stars. It dragged a bit in certain scenes. While there was a nice twist to the story at the end it didn't impact the viewer the was other plot twists have in other movies similar to this. If you are an Amazon Prime member, wait till they release it as a Prime movie so you don't have to pay for the rental.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Good album Bowie never let's you down he has been reinventing himself for a very long time and he never fails to impress.
B005HED08I|4.0|What else is there to say. These are the originals! Once you get past the 60's production they are still great shows and the digital remastering was done very well. I'm sure some miss the old space scenes but I enjoy seeing the new CGI, it was done tastefully.
B00846WWVM|4.0|My three year old grandson begs to play sprinkle, he loves putting out the fires.  He is better at it than grandma is.
B00A7CI82I|2.0|This movie did not live up to my expectations. The first three were great with the story lines. This was boring and very predictable. They probably should have quit with the third installment rather then tarnish it with this one.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|The premise of 2 universes on a road to destruction is mind grabbing.  Most episodes have a satisfactory ending.  Fringe events generally are some kind of mystery running the gamut from weird science, biology, mental, and almost anything else you can imagine.  The series has a highly satisfactory conclusion, so this is one you'll enjoy.  I didn't like every episode, but most of them were done well.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|anyone who is interested in a broadway show coming to the big screen.<br /><br />Amazing quality of the DVD and the sound
B004U52VPS|2.0|The game was not as expected<br />it was a cheap version of what I expected<br />Since angry bird is popular I assumed the game would be better constructed<br />I did not return it since it was a gift and opened
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This movie looked funny in  the trailer, however... It's really stupid and borring. We stopped it after watching for 30 minutes.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|works as described and expected<br />would recommend to others to download<br />Have used it very often<br />thanks for having the app
B001AQR3JY|5.0|One of our family's favority movie. My 5 year old has been watching it over and over again. Great classic!
B001EIOOV8|5.0|The star rating is for the movie itself, not the disc.. The Casino Blu Ray is yet another example of how greedy these companies are.. This doesn't have all the special features that were on the two disc DVD version.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I can't wait for the next one! Genius, the way the Lord of the Rings characters are woven in! Very entertaining!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|These books are fantastic! I loved Abby and Travis and couldnt wait to find out what happened. Never disappointed in the end!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Ben Affleck is a genius, and the movie was so full of suspense! Loved the way it ended. Very good movie, one that can be watched over and over!
B005DVJQHY|5.0|The Master Key System by Charles Haanel is forrunner of The Secret. The Master Key System, like the Secret, is life changing and a book that will provide value each time it is read.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|With knowledge of this country being so limited, we are blessed to have a first hand account such as this to allow us to understand the Kim regimes totalitarian infastructure. I wish it told more about outside the wire in North Korea, but that may be someone else's gift to us.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Pays homage to a lot of the old 'horror' movies.  Tim Burton has won again in this cute and imaginative story.  Great update to the original film short back in the 90's.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|Read subject  ^  ... good read if you are looking to debate something with someone... but now i have to add 7 more words to the review.... so here ya go.
0307887960|3.0|this was a purchase for a dietary theory class. This program works for some, not for others. If you are unsure about it then you should speak to your physician or a nutritional specialist.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I watched this on a suggestion from a colleague (We are both Jewish.)and it has become one of my staples.<br />I think that many Jewish Americans can identify with the desire to 'go back' to Russia, Germany, etc, or wherever their family originally came fromand find out how they escaped or faredWW2., and this movie really hits the spot!I literally talk all my friends into seeing this movie.  the book, not so much., his other books, liked a lot less.  the actors play such characters, that it makes the movie very entertaining.
B002UHSDUK|5.0|I love everything about this album! Great vocals and awesome guitar riffs and drums. There is nothing I disliked about this album at all.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This was my first JT purchase - I based my purchase solely on the sound of Suit and Tie.  What a complete pleasure.  Thank God I heard this first because - his earlier CDs didn't inspire me.  My best friend hates this because its not like his earlier material.  For me, this is for the Grown and Sexxxy crowd - loved just about every cut - my least favorite is Body Count - my favorites are Pusher Love Girl; Strawberry Bubblegum (What?  I'm almost 50!) Ha! - Tunnel Vision - Blue Ocean (Maxwell)???  Dress on!  Hell - practically the entire CD.  To me - this brings to mind Usher, Maxwell, Robin Thicke and old D'Angelo.  Noticing a theme here?  Anyway, I highly recommend this CD - haven't stopped listening to it since I purchased it.<br /><br />S.
B0088XXCZ6|1.0|I did not like this album. Not what I expected from her. I understand she was going for more of a jazz sound but it came out choppy with no real rythm to follow. Use of wording didn't follow well either.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|A lovely read that travels between worlds with ease. Pre war empires to war torn London with it's dramas to the naïveté of a rural 1950s through to the sophisticated modern day. Secrets all along the way unravelling.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|No one has vocals as Lana Del Rey. Her use of words and rythm is extraordinary and her ability to go from alto to soprano just adds to the overall experience.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I actually was watching on the plane and didn't get tofinish it. Ive heard its an excellent movie though. From what I saw it was interesting
B005C7MVC6|3.0|I enjoyed his vocals but the overall ambiance of the album was a little slow. Some of the songs seem to drag on without any build up to the chorus. Leaves you wanting more.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|THIS SEASON IS ONE OF THE BEST!!!!  I WAS VERY SAD TO SEE ELI AND JACKIE DIE!!!!  I HOPE MORE SURPRISES ARE IN THE FUTURE!!
B007H1HQW0|5.0|Fun little device for cutting bottles.  The unit makes a great cut, but after than forget their directions.  I found using a small torch and cold water was faster and resulted in clean cuts as well.  Plus you did not need their little tapping tool for this process.  The other design flaw is not in having a rest platform for the bottle.  The cut is super, but you need the bottle in a horizonal position to make the cut.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|First, let me state that I easily read this book in less than a day so clearly it held my attention. But much of it was a repeat of the first book, and there really wasn't a lot of heat with either Aspen or Maxon. Plus, sometimes I just wanted smack America for being so dense! Seriously, after what happened to your best friend you still risk your life toying with a guy while you think you're in love with another? She doesn't think things through. Still, I did enjoy this second installment and hope to see America with Maxon. I just wanted to see the characters and the plot more fleshed out. Nevertheless, I recommend this series - just make sure you read the first book or you'll be lost. You might want to read it again to refresh your memory as not much background is given. Enjoy!
1612191290|1.0|Before we implement Professor Graeber's gratuitous cancellation of debt, would someone please give me about a week's notice.  It will take about that long for my family, friends, and acquaintances to max out our credit and debit cards.  If you can spare more, we would certainly appreciate it.  Dr. Graeber, I have to say, you are a such a nice guy.<br /><br />Thanks so much!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|The bugs need to be fixed. I love playing on facebook. But when I play on either my phone or Kindle the bonus game on the slots freeze and I lose credits due to the game having an unexpected error.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|Great movie based on a true story during the Great Depression.  Will watch it over and over again.<br />It was shipped at the promised time and is in new shape as promised.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started with season 1 and now at the end of season 3 I can't wait to see how this is gonna end. I'm glued to this show!!
B00ALQSNV6|5.0|Bought this for my two sons (5 and 9), who both really like dinosaurs. They were not disappointed! My wife found it too graphic in the depiction of predators' meal time: a good indication that boys will find it awesome! Very well done, good CGI, good narration. It keeps your interest up for the 30 min it lasts. One can learn from it while being entertained!
B00B23O96A|5.0|What a disappointment with this new cd. Old Sock is the worst cd I have heard in years. I can't stand Rap but, that would be easier to listen to than this totally uninspiring recording. I strongly suggest you pass on this one. Too bad, I really like Clapton.
B007IK44CK|5.0|I loved the action and suspense.  one of the best MI movies yet.  Certainly worth a do over for me.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|i love this show, its very witty and a lot of fun to watch. i'd highly recommend it to anyone.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I'm sick there will be no more from this story or about any of the more colorful characters. Just enough Steampunk gadgets to make it fun. The back and forth tension between the vampires and werewolves keeps moving the story further with twists and turns. The basis to who Alexa is, is  the idea that for every toxin there is a response by nature to neutralize its effects. So,not to give too much of the story away, the main character is natures response to both vampires and werewolves. The tension between Alexa and her husband and his bullheadedness, sometimes tested my patients, but level heads and a dash of reason prevailed. The only thing I can find fault is the women in her family. The complete vacuous and vicious shallowness of her mother and sisters felt like a step backwards from the strong character the author gave Alexa.<br /><br />The last book seemed a bit rushed to tie up all of the lose ends.The storyline seemed a bit forced. Every book sent me on a different emotional ride. I loved the female lead was strong willed, self reliant and willing to thumb her nose at convention from her choice of spouse to her best friend. Regardless of the woman on the book cover, Alexa is a full figured, food loving, non-conventional, but exotic beauty who knows her mind. I want to be her! I do wish the author had more to explore about this group of characters. So many of them had rich personalities and back stories.<br /><br />All of the books were a fast and engaging read. I did have a hard time putting them down and found myself reading well into the next morning. I could see Victorian London, the moors of Scotland and the sands of Egypt, they were so well written. I loved this series and may read it again...just because.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Multiple story lines that are preferably interwoven into a fast moving and believable plot. WE look forward to next season.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Anyone who loves these movies should own a copy of the whole set on Blu-Ray ... End of Story , LIVE LONG AND PROSPER
0307730697|5.0|This is one of the most moving books I have read. It was a great tribute to a true American Hero!
B001FB55H6|5.0|This movie rocks my socks off - I dont care what anyone thinks this is a great flick<br /><br />This Blu Ray will help me Watch the Watchmen
B005K17RU0|5.0|Good stuff, not a memory hog, shows constant temp on the task bar and has good layout for the day's and 5 days forcast. I like it!
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown weaves fact and fiction together into a puzzle that sheds new light on religious dogmas. Once you start reading you won't be able to put it down until you finish.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Interesting the plotting for the throne and kings made! Brother against brother and the influence of evil queens! Great book.
1451695195|3.0|I picked this up while questioning what happens after death, having lost my dad to cancer. I have a curious mind and always like to have some scientific measure to everything. I was curious how a doctor could reconcile a life after death experience. This is an easy read, and he does have a website he mentions to visit after the book.<br />It would be nice if he went into more detail, but understand that he was trying to write of his experiences first and then reconcile and sort out similarity and difference to other Near death experiences later.
0062012339|1.0|I can't believe that I actually purchased this piece of crap.  I'm ashamed of myself.  If anyone wants this for free just let me know because I'll be happy to send it off.  This was nothing more than an OLD rock band rehashing.  There was no insight that no one already didn't know.  I don't even really like the band itself, but someone had told me this was an interesting look on what it was to be in a band.  If that's the case.. you can keep this crap.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great to play if you need to pas the time.  Easy and yet challenging at the same time. Great for every single family member that can swipe a finger.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is addictive at times. Very fun to play. It's not like normal bingo. You have to win collection items to complete the rooms.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Great depiction of a sad time in our American history.  The characters seemed real and elicited my empathy.  I'm glad the author brought this awful tale to our attention.  I recommend it.
B009GX6600|5.0|Keeps you glued to the TV, great dynamics and plot. I just cant wait to watch the next episode :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|every person needs to read this to get their spiritual life in order<br /><br />Very powerful and humbling. I highly recommend it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am very impressed with the fact that &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; does not depend on blood and guts to carry the series. The plots are very well thought out and the cast is perfect!
B008JAGZDE|5.0|Really funny movie. It was a great addition to the rest of all the american pies:) I'd definitely watch it again!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|All the actors do a remarkable job telling this true story. Definitely R rated.<br /><br />I loved how humor was used to approach the subject and the side story about getting advice from the Priest was great too. Definitely worth watching.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series keeps you interested with all the twists. A very good read. I highly recommend for the mature reader.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Fast Read.  Great info. It works...I have lost over 6 pounds in little less than 3 weeks following this book - and IT IS EASY!
B004OT2WKO|4.0|I got this on the Amazon Marketplace, used (\\"collectable\\"!?).  As the build progressed I realized pieces were missing.  Disappointing but not surprising for a set with this many pieces.  Regardless of that I offer a piece of advice, some of the first segments to be built is the gear system for the motorized and pneumatic functions.  Be very careful with this and triple check your work.  I dinged the durability rating on this because the suspension tilts to one side when the batteries are loaded and the claw crane is, shall we say, delicate.
B000I6ND6Y|5.0|I am a Bruce Springsteen fan and his versions of Mitch Ryder songs on this album are just fantastic.Highly recommend this music.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an excellent show.  It really helps to begin this at Season 1 to understand the relationships, and what came before.  I would highly recommend it.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Boz Scaggs has always been one of my favorite artists...it's funny how his music is played in the movies all the time.  This CD is one of his best, in my opinion!  I have been playing it non-stop since downloading it!  Every song is great and if you get it, believe me, you won't be disappointed!!!~
B00BRPDO14|5.0|...after standing through a show in Stockholm ... I left into the cool night humming their melody...<br />the new work brought back that energy...
0988178532|5.0|This thrilling, magical coming of age story has something to offer everyone, no matter what your genre of choice may be!  The story is magical, adventurous, thrilling, heartfelt, suspenseful, thought-provoking and even a little romantic. Nate, the main character, begins as an average teenager who suddenly finds himself experiencing intense, unexplainable dreams and visions.  His life is soon complicated even more by the discovery of a conspiracy involving his family and his own newly discovered gifts.  Legg's book takes off from there on a wild adventure ride that keeps you turning pages and contemplating the book even after you have put it down.<br />The new-age mysticism throughout the book is well researched and somewhat reminiscent of \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\".  I loved the interwoven stories of past lives, connectedness to others and the powers of the universe and the soul.  The lessons that Nate learns throughout the book are some that resonate off the pages and into real life. Legg does an amazing job with the imagery in the book and really puts you in the beautiful places described.  His characters are well developed, relatable and have clear chemistry.  This is truly one of the best books I have read in a very long time and one that will never be forgotten.  I cannot wait for the 2nd installment to come out!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This is an entertaining game<br />It is fun and addictive as well. I really enjoy playing this game .  I would highly recommend this game
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love it!  The force fields that wipe out the pigs, light saber chops and the missile shots!  Even when you lose a level, it's Dark Vader that mocks you!!  Fun, I went all the way through, now I am back to all the levels I did not get 3 stars on!!
B005DJREJS|5.0|I Remember Watching This Show When I Was A Kid.<br />I Just Rediscovered It And I Love It. I Wish There Were More Than 4 Seasons. Season Three Is My Favorite.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this app, I got it after seeing into on Disney channel and love it. I would recommend it to a friend any day.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So addictive! I spend hours on pintrest and its ruining my personal life. There are so many ideas! So glad I found it for my android. Now I can spend even more time on it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I was confused when I read this book about this woman who supposely had an<br />accident and was in a coma for several years. I didn't know at the beginning that<br />her husband wasn't her husband. I was happy that it turned out alright and she<br />was reunited with her real husband at the end. There was a very strong climax.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This 2-volume collection of the first two seasons of Downton Abbey is perfect for those who have come to the series late and need to catch up fast! The series covers the drama and elegance of the early 20th century Britain just the bankrupting lifestyle of the rich is nearing its end. The series captures the era very well, with a focus on the shifting relationships between aristocrats and their servants, woven in with changes coming from new technologies (telephone, electricity, automobiles) and continent-wide war.<br /><br />The extras features give enough of a glimpse into the costumes and period without wrecking the spell cast by the series' brilliant writing and superb acting. A treasure!
B00B4804KS|5.0|I'm not really going to review the movie itself, but rather its conversion to a 3-D feature. Because let's be honest here... Jurassic Park is the best and there is no arguing otherwise. End of story.<br /><br />In today's day in age, seeing a film in 3-D isn't anything new. Who knew!? But where that might be super cool, this is also a time where studios are quick to give movies the 3-D treatment in post production rather unnecessarily. The unfortunate product of this greed-driven agenda is an often sloppy, subpar and rather uncomfortable viewing experience. As an avid movie-goer, this makes me all sorts of sad. So when I heard they were re-releasing Jurassic Park in 3-D, I was somewhat hesitant albeit still very excited. I remember seeing the original release in theatres so my expectations set the bar quite high. Were they about to ruin one of my favourite features of all-time? Or were we in for cinema gold?<br /><br />By the time I sat down on movie night with my liter of cola and Twizzlers, my nerves were shot. The lights dimmed and I watched it in my well-founded anticipation. In 3-D. And after two hours of in-your-face drama, the hubby and I walked out totally speechless. Words can't even describe how blown away I was by it. Next to Tron: Legacy, Jurassic Park was the best 3-D film (or any film) I've ever seen on the big screen. This is the real deal! Where in many cases, 3-D is used as a distraction technique, here it only serves to enhance the film's magical qualities.<br /><br />StereoD took their time (over a year) with the conversion process and it really shows. Steven Spielberg is one of those painstakingly careful directors that has a mind and an eye for depth, detail and vision which only helped the film in this case. Jurassic Park strikes a careful balance between the CG effects and 3-D without coming across as being too much to handle. It breathes new life into the lush, exotic sets and adds a whole new level of thrills to the action that's culminating on screen. I really appreciated Spielberg's selectiveness on which scenes to present in 3-D---the initial dino reveal, the T-Rex escape, the Jeep chase, the Gallimimus herd, and raptor kitchen scene (among others)---they were all appropriately chosen and the new depth of field really added to the sense of wonder, awe and danger we as an audience felt.<br /><br />In addition, we're privy to an added level of detail that we've never seen before. From the scales on the dinosaurs to the patterns and textures in the scenery, it's enough to make the already impressive CGI seem even more real. Jurassic Park was already at the top of its film-making game when it combined digital effects and animatronics. It's a happy surprise to see that 3-D didn't detract from the from the movie at all, in fact, the effect was just the opposite---it enhanced it. The added layers intensified my viewing experience to the max and allowed me to feel the same sense of imagination and wonder as the first time I saw it on the big screen. THIS is what the technology was created for, my friends!<br /><br />Food for Thought: Jurassic Park is exactly the type of movie that's meant to be seen in 3-D! The attention to detail and careful conversion process gives new meaning to movie magic and helps to create a heightened sense of depth and added drama. This movie was a vision that was expertly executed and is beyond worthy. It's even enough to justify the few extra dollars on the hefty price of admission.on screen.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season Three of the Downton Abbey series is a series of one reversal and tragedy after another. The estate is in trouble because of Lord Grantham's unwise investments. But could there be another source of funds? Matthew presses hard to make Downton self-sufficient, while Branson is on the run from the police. Bates (in prison) and wife lose touch with each other and fear the worst. There are pregnancies, deaths, perils, threats and all sorts of tumult. Friends become enemies and enemies friends.<br /><br />The pacing and action and changes of fortune is so relentless that some might wonder whether Downton will soon jump the shark. Truly, how many shocks can one household absorb over such a short period? Frankly, some of the most dramatic plot turns were VERY disagreeable and seemingly unnecessary. But the third season, taking us from 1920 to 1921, is still exciting and eminently watchable. If the writers can keep the plot under control, season 4 will be worth watching.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|If you though the old Six Wives of Henry VIII was inaccurate, you ain't seen nothin' until you've watched The Tudors.  Lots of crazy stuff to heighten the drama, including killing off Henry FitzRoy at about age 5, when he died just shy of 18 years apparently from tuberculosis and had fathered an couple of illegitimate children.  Other than the historical errors, the drama itself is well done and worth watching as a piece of historical fiction.  I really do love for this.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Wonderful book! Kept me engaged, yet I would like a sequel. Brilliant use of the tender meanings of flowers. Thought provoking.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Terrible - the screen freezes a lot.  I will buy the game and hope it will be ok.  I have this game on iPad and I really like it.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|Amazing performance by Meryl Streep.  Was Margaret Thatcher really that crazy at the end of her life?  Hard working women who achieved great success politically, but in the end lost her family.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Almost like they are taking you somewhere on an adventure with this album.  The songs all have such interesting twists and turns.  Musically, I deem the majority of the tracks as both dark and whimsically full of promise & hope.  Best complete album I've heard in quite a while.  Especially love the Intros, Ms, Matilda, Breezeblocks & Taro.
B005F3XV62|3.0|Decent film.  Okay to watch with your kids.  Won't annoy you, but not film of the year material by far.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Make your rating system simple. Give people the option to type a review. I like this show but not enough to give you a thesis.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|its really fun and easy to work. not only can you draw but its almost like and instagram. you can do some pretty cool things with the pictures you already have:)
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I don't know who wrote the Editorial Review for this movie. I think it is absurd and nonsense. In 1922, Spain was in a transition from monarchy to the republic. Called  Garcia Lorca's lifestyle &#34;decadent&#34; is a great mistake. The great men in Madrid, like Dali, Garcia Lorca, Bunuel and others were the conscience of the nation. All this generation that eat, drink and have sex are no different from my generation at the University of Puerto Rico in the '70s or the generation of the 2000's and now. We can't call this &#34;decadent&#34;  because we condemn all the generations to the same adjective. Garcia Lorca is one of the best, maybe the best poet and drama writer of the 20th century, as it was said by no one but Pablo Neruda. Garcia Lorca is the Shakespear of Spain. Francisco Franco and his army where the generation of decadent, and they destroyed the life of this unique and extraordinary artist. Shame to the Spain people of that historic events of that generation.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|A very good book for the people who like reading about history. It's actuall like a dictionary. You want something, you just go to this book and find.
B00BWU0S3Q|1.0|This movie is a painful experience to sit through. Painful because it's inept and intelligence insulting to the max. It's a mess on nearly every level. Sometimes movie projects have all the right chemistry and promise on paper, but miss the mark by a great margin. Others miss the mark by leaps and bounds such as De Palma's crap ridden horrible stinker 'The black Dahlia', which is a tormenting film to sit through in every conceivable way. Then you have this movie that is so bad you have to gauge it by something much worse like the Black Dahlia in which to even measure anything good about it. How this film got 3 and 4 star reviews is anyone's geuss. I'm still scratching my head. It appears everything was in place for this to have become a big hit of the year. An A list of solid actors, an interesting true story and a good budget. But the fault clearly lays squarely upon the backs of bad planning, a terrible script and horrible direction. Nick Nolte's performance alone is worth seeing for it's unintentional comic qualities, Penn is actually quite good at times, and others seems lost and hasn't a clue what to do with the s*** script he's had to waddle through. Gosling is wooden as hell, as is Josh Brolin, who is sadly just as wooden. Everyone else is as well. So far this is the worst movie I've seen all year. Crap is crap, then there's ultra ughh crap like this. Please skip this one if you happen to be someone who knows what a good movie truly is, or even a just OK one. This movie screams back at you that it wishes it had never been made. it is on my list of the top 50 worst movies of all time, coming in at around #35
B00BHU9CCO|5.0|My 2-1/2 yr. old son loved it.  I thought it would be too scary for him, but he didn't seem too frightened by the scary parts.<br />A must have Pixar classic!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|These actors are just absolutely terrific!!  Their wardrobes are great and how they portray the characteristics of vikings is unreal. Beautiful scenery. Great show.
B006UKC566|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone who likes action movies. the visual style was very well done. The plot and some of the acting wasn't the best, but as long as your main goal is to be entertained and your expectations aren't too high this will do the job.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|Well done twisting and plotting of the stories. All are looking at a common cause but none have a clear path to it or holding on to it, The Iron Throne.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|The whole family enjoys this app.  Easy to use and lots of fun regardless of the age.  I've used it with a 13 month old all the way to my teenagers.  They love it!
B008602KQI|3.0|After seeing it I do not know what all the hype was about. It had some good moments but overall was disjointed.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|If anything, it was a bit depressing. Was hoping for more laughs. I love Paul Rudd and the whole cast, actually, but found the movie very long (2 hours 18 minutes) and dragged. The humor was very dark and not at all funny. There was tons of foul language, even on the behalf of the little kids in the movie. I'm going to turn 40 in less than a year, and frankly, I'm happy to say my life is nothing like this movie.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Excellent start for the continuing story. Has some surprises and leaves you waiting to see what happens in the next season.
030758836X|1.0|I did not like this book and, usually, when I figure this out within the first 80 pages, I stop reading. All the great reviews and numerous stars made me finish it. And not like it any better.<br /><br />It started out okay, but when the you-know-what hit the fan, it got very unrealistic. Both characters are psychos, they do unbelievable stuff to each other and the end is contrived and unrealistic.<br /><br />I'm trying to figure out why people liked this book? Besides having to be a creative and well-informed person, about mental illnesses to write such characters, I don't have much to say that is positive about this book.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Good app, but sometimes interrupts you to remind you it is time to read the Bible. And is always on in the background. Tried it at church, turned out to be more cumbersome and slower than our sermon, nothing gained there.  Excellent for home meditation.
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|As with all sequels, This one is not like the ones before it. It's not bad, definitely worth watching if you saw the other 3. Plot spoiler: ending stunk!
B00A4TKDKY|4.0|People go to concerts to hear the artist play the song as close to the studio version as possible.  That is not live music, and the way people like Buddy Guy came up is nowhere the same as some other more well off artists. The Beatles were classically trained, for instance. Buddy Guy suffered on a farm. Much rougher, so expect a rougher live rendition. Buddy Guy is human, had a rough life, and the beauty of this album is the glimpse we get into the real Guy, not some controlled studio version. I personally loved it, since I don't have to travel to a live venue to hear the real Buddy Guy.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This has to be one of the best shows I've seen. It's almost addictive. The plot and story twists are incredible. I will keep you glued to the TV. I can't wait for season 3.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Really touching story dealing with mental illness without being depressing or maudelin.  The way the story unfolds kept me riveted.  Definitely recommend it!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Could have been alot better. Too much relationship drama. I'm a big fan of Family Guy so I thought it would be funny. Don't get me wrong, it had it's moments and alot of them but I give it a 5. The girl was annoying and the relationship drama too exhausting. Would have been much better with more crazy partying and less drama. Worth the watch though for some good laughs.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. This should be shown to kids going into the army today. Just to see how things were back then.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Read this one if you like good true tales well told.  Owen goes through training, the Phillips rescue and event by event review of the Bin Laden raid.  Along the trip I marveled at the extent of physical and military training of assault professionals.  This one is enjoyable action and education.
1451648537|5.0|Excellent reading. Very informative and entertaining. Gave me new respect for the man and his company. Intend to read it again.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I'm so glad I rented these instant videos.  I needed to watch this series from the beginning to fully grasp the story.  Eccleston and Piper do a great job.  Since I love historical fiction,  I'm used to seeing Eccleston as the very dark,  treacherous Duke of Norfolk in Elizabeth,  and I thought I would never embrace him as another character.  He does a spectacular job in this,  however.  He has the perfect amount of seriousness and goofiness,  that makes The Doctor seem very human, but for a moment you can believe he is an alien.  I'm up to Season 4 now,  so I can say I like Donna more as a companion to The Doctor,  but Rose Tyler(Piper) is of importance too.  This is the beginning of a very subtle romance.  One thing I can appreciate about the Doctor Who series is that it manages to have romance without being sexualized.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I wavered in my decision to watch this movie, since I had heard both excellent and poor reviews.  I felt like a movie like this needed to be seen though.  It was definitely worth watching!  The acting was top notch.  It wasn't meant for light entertainment, but it kept me totally engaged throughout.  It was very interesting to see how much politics played in ending the Civil War and passing the 13th Amendment.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Developed the characters very well.  You could feel as Ender did as he went through his training and relate it to your younger life
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Amazing show, Julianne is marvelous & the story lines never get old. I can't wait to dive into season two!
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Kept the readers interest throughout the book.  I liked the development of characters however there was no one character to follow for the entire trip
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Quentin Tarantino does it again. Amazing shots with blood brutally that shocks you. Slaps you in the face with brutal reality of slavery in the US.<br /><br />On par with Pulp Fiction.
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|There are those movies that you want to watch over and over again when what you seriously need is something to take your mind off of the stresses of life. This is one of those movies for me. It's already in my heavy rotation. Wahlberg and Kunis are charming. And Ted is the sort of character that could only come from the mind of Seth MacFarlane.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Next princess movie with a twist. Fiery red head doesn't let a prince come to save her but instead makes her own adventure.
B008LC8TJI|1.0|I love Maroon 5.  I was very excited when this album came out and purchased it without hesitation.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed as I was going through the songs. This album does not even sound like Maroon 5.  There are maybe two songs that I think are okay, but the rest of the album is terrible.  I'm not sure what happened, they've had great songs on all their other albums.  These songs seem like they're more digitized and less instrumental, which is unfortunate because I've always loved the electric guitar sound in their songs.  This album was not for me.
B0019LZV4E|1.0|I LOVE Johnny Depp and Steven Spielberg but this movie was very disappointing. I really almost fell asleep. Maybe I overestimated it and I never watched the original. Wouldn't suggest it to anyone.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|One of my favorite shows. A big fan of Sheldon and his crew!!!<br />Lots of laughs and a very entertaining show.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I had really enjoyed the Black Swan, but Antifragile is even better, and much more practical than its elder brother. Changed my views on risk management and &#34;option taking&#34;. The author does a great job at presenting rather complex ideas and make them accessible to the non technical reader. Highly recommended.
B007EECSFA|3.0|boring and keeps going back in time too much ,other wise a great read for rainy days and winters eve
B005HWAOCA|4.0|I always thought Clapton sold off after Cream and Blind Faith going soft and mellow. To me he was his best with Cream. I still think he should have been on that helicopter instead of Stevie Ray Vaughn. All in all this DVD was amazing...Baker still kicking butt, Bruce singing with emotion and the best.....Clapton playing like CLAPTON!!!!
B008LFY6NI|3.0|This is cute and creative...but does not seem to keep the attention of the children long.  Maybe older children would enjoy it more.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|To Violent, shut it off and didn't finish the movie.  Acting and story was well done but much to violent
B0085W09ME|5.0|Found my flights to Florida and California at a very decent rate compared to all the other sites. Letting all my friends know about this site.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|This is my first album and I like the sound and have only had it and another new album for a few weeks. I think I have listened to both albums at least 10-15 times each. I just put the whole album on repeat. Love it so much!! Plus you can't beat the price!!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|If you like LotR this is a must see movie. Great story line and cant wait for the next movie.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is such a great idea.it's one thing to guesstimate how much time is left. It's amazing to know exactly how much time is left. Great app that works great.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|i really enjoyed this game, though it was long it was very entertaining. i really want to play the second enigmatis.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This movie is rated a 5 because it is so well done. I am anxiously awaiting the next addition in the series..
B0064MGU98|5.0|I began watching this show on my i pad via Amazon Prime, and was quickly 'hooked'. The cast, characters, and plot lines are all well developed and executed by the cast.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|Shaun the sheep is funny and entertaining for all ages. I recommend also getting season 1 to complete your collection. You can't beat the price for a kids show that adults enjoy watching too. If you like Shaun the sheep you might want to check out Wallace and grommet too. It's by the same creators.
B003B96AOW|5.0|this figure is amazing in its detail and accesories the diamond select sculptors obviously take pride in their craft i plan to order more
B007EECSFA|5.0|I like to think I'm good at knowing how a story will end, but I was surprised (happily so) that I was kept in suspense until the final pages of this book. The character development is great. You love some and you hate some. You're also surprised by some.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Greatest game ever, very challenging and can be played over and over with new challenges.  Games like this is hard to find, cannot find a negative thing to say, well worth the money you'll spend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's the best post-apocalyptic drama I have ever seen or read! Each episode is well paced, balanced, envolving and the suspense is always intense.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very detailed hidden object pictures mixed with a good story. I play these with my daughter and they pose a good challenge for the two of us on expert mode.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Just got my FF GH CD.  Perfect condition and I just love it!  I give it the highest rating there is.<br />thanks
B0054XOMX4|4.0|My grandson has been talking about &#34;Beyblades&#34;, had no idea what it was, ordered blind, It was a total success.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mr. Howey has crafted a world that,while fiction, could one day be our future. His characters at full  of life and expertly crafted.  This was one story that was hard to put down.  I'm looking forward to where else he can take m e.  I Used to never write reviews but have recently changed my mind as I find so many great storytellers waiting to be \\"heard\\"e.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I enjoyed the earlier books quit a bit but, sadly, felt let down by the 4'th and 5'th of this series.  It feels increasingly dark as the stories progress.  Let me explain.  In earlier books the darkness was used as punctuation for the story where the last few books the darkness permeated the entire story with no relief at all.  I also felt that too many characters and story lines were killed in this book with no decent replacement.  Maybe that was the plan so that book 6 doesn't have to become book 6 and 7.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Just another 007 Bond movie.  Nothing particularly interesting overall.  I think that maybe 50 years of Bond is more than enough.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is probably the closest book to an actual real-life fairy tale that I can imagine and enjoy. Couples go through hard times even before they realize that they are meant for each other. Safe to say I can relate to this book. Can't wait to read Travis' version in &#34;Walking Disaster&#34;.
B000IZ7YK6|4.0|Intrigue abounds.  Troubling denouement.  Overall a well done mystery and critical comment on the way things were (or maybe still are).
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing this shame you can Only collection once a day. I tend to play it as soon as my new coins come up
B00BF11STU|5.0|Even though I knew the outcome of this movie, I found it riveting from the very beginning to the very end.
0385342063|4.0|I really like Sophie Kinsella.  She is a quirky writer and I like her style.  I hope to read more of her books soon.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Usually I like period pieces.  However, this one was just too slow and even a bit too kitschy.  The costuming was well done.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I had heard nothing but good things about this book, but kept putting off reading it. There was never a good reason, so now I'm kicking myself because this is definitely one of the best books I've read in a very long time!!<br /><br />Travis and Abby were not looking for love, but it found them in a very intense way. Starting as friends, they got to know one another and became comfortable with each other. They were both still hiding their past, but for their own reasons, and each of them thought it was for the best. Though, the closer they became, the more the walls started to crumble until they realized that they were perfect for each other.<br /><br />The story line was totally believable and every single one of the characters were true and well developed. The writing was amazing and brought the reader into the lives of these wonderful people as they found their way together.<br /><br />I loved this book and cannot wait to read it again!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The movie was what I expected.  The cast is totally the best...all of my favorites and the story was great.
B008220D7S|5.0|I love love love this movie. It is freakin hilarious!!!! I rented it on redbox, but definitely am going to purchase for the simple fact that watching this movie would pick me up on any bad day!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe Reader was easy to download to my Kindle Fire and it works just fine. For a free app, it's even better than fine! :)
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Can't beat Danny Devito & Rhea Pearlman as the world's worst parents with a gifted daughter. The bad guys are so bad and the good guys win in the end.
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|Our son has had hours of fun with the camera.  It functions exactly as it's claims.  I would buy it again.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Fun and funny altho I will never understand angry bird physics I get addicted to the games quickly or I hate them and ditch them. This one has become my before bed favorite.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Loved the Lord of Rings and so glad they did the Hobbit - can't wait for next one.  Good actors, great cinematography, gorgeous location, attention to detail, special effects, action, fun lines - go it all!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|If you're someone who really knows strategy this game is a must. For those who have problems with yours it must be the device. Works on mine and lots of others.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This  album  has  it  all.  It  flows  so  smoothly  with  all  her  great  songs.  You  won't  be  disappointed. I  loved  it.
B002KREVCO|5.0|While it was not the working amplifier version, the Backtracks is a great compliment to the Family Jewels / Plug Me In releases.  The CD was good although most of the songs on it can be found on bootlegs that are floating around too.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|She  has  alot  of  great  songs  on  this.  You  can't  help  but love  her  voice. She  has  a  great  heart.
B009GJBEF6|5.0|I have loved James Bond films since I was a child.  My family always watched these films together, it was probably the only thing we did together.<br /><br />Yes this is the same as my other reviews for James Bond films.  I hate writing these things.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I  wanted  this  for  her  hits  on  the  radio.  I  fell  in  love  with  other  songs  I  had  never  heard  before.  She  is  a  talent  and  I  loved  all  the  songs. She  has  a  way  with  words.
B001D09OAI|5.0|This movie is one of the all-time greats, and a movie that any baseball fan should not only see, but own.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I  saw  this  funny  movie  and  loved  the  songs.  It's  a  feel  good  album,  that  ends  too  soon.  It  flows  nicely.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This is a heart breaking story of Alice and her battle with early onset Alzheimer's at the age of 50.<br /><br />You read about her struggles in losing her mind. As a highly intelligent professor at Harvard Alice and her husband John have a hard time with her diagnosis. Her 3 adult children are now at risk and two choose to be tested while the youngest takes it for chance.<br /><br />While it brings her closer to her children it drives her and her husband apart. In 2 years she loses everything she never knew she even had.<br /><br />I of course cried like a baby.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I liked how you can have  your own park and you have different dragons and compete an  share with your friends
B000JMKTLO|3.0|So I put my name on the barrow list from the library at the same time as Gone Girl. I received Gone Girl first and did not like it at all. I almost just removed my name from the waiting list for this book. I found a lot of the same faults as I did with Gone Girls writing style. I just don't like it.<br /><br />So this book was full of a bunch of disturbing people. Almost from the start I \\"knew\\" it was the mom. It was evident very early she was clearly very lucky to make it out of that house alive. Camille has her scars to bare from the experience of growing up with her. I thought it was weird that she cut random words. I mean most of them were adjectives. But there would be a random noun.<br /><br />This book made it sound as if it was a murder mystery. When really she did nothing investigative. Her relationship with Richard was weird. And then with John.<br /><br />Amma. Good god. It's so hard to blame her for her behavior. But who in their right mind would allow Camille to take her as a guardian. Realistically. Amma needed help that Camille couldn't not provide. Plus I'm not convinced she didn't need help herself.<br /><br />So the mom focused solely in the kids and not her husband?? That was odd.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|This is a truly amazing Movie. The Cirque Du Soleil team is truly amazing. It is hard to take your eyes off the TV.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I have to admit, this movie let me down. I had pretty high expectations going in and was let down on every front. If you're a fanboy of the play, I'd be willing to be you'll enjoy the movie. But, if you are looking to sit down and watch something that is quality, I'd pass on this and go to something else.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|romantic, fabulous acting. This is my all time favorite movie. very clean. I recommend most BBC films that have aired on PBS
B00846REIS|5.0|Fantastic book.  Will recommend in a heart beat to all my family and friends. Couldn't put the book down. :)
B003KZZ4TO|5.0|This sounds great on vinyl.  A nice comeback album from Eminem.  Stronger than &#34;Relapse&#34; and a many great collaborations with Pink, Lil Wayne and Rhianna<br /><br />This may not be the angry Eminem that we grew to live it is still reminiscent of his earlier work.  The top tracks are &#34;Love the way you Lie&#34;, &#34;Cinderella Man&#34; and &#34;Wont Back Down&#34;.  It is somewhat of a departure because there are no skits but thats okay because they were always the weakest part to me.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|I heard these guys as the opening act to the Who last year and they were great!  Thanks for sending it so quickly as I received it today!
B00BJS7104|3.0|I thought the movie was kinda dumb. Violence doesn't bother me if it has purpose.  Most of this didn't. It reminded me of a takeoff on an old Spaghetti Western not done very well.  Of course this is just my opinion.
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|I was excited to hear that Legacy Recordings was putting out a 2disc set of ELVIS' classic album Aloha From Hawaii via Satellite. I already own the Alternate Aloha from back in the day. The sound of both discs are impeccable,and i liked the liner notes and packaging layout. I just wish there was a bonus such as the historic concert Dvd included. Overall,it's great and very entertaining.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Compared to other sci fi series then and now I have always found Star Trek' s plots to be more socially conscious and aware while still entertaining.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong, and I've been addicted to it for years.  I recommend it to anybody who enjoys this type of game.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fun book. Definitely worth reading. Good summer reading material.  Or a day at the cape cod beaches Good job Mira
1452115567|5.0|Maddie, sweet pup girl, is a very beautiful, funny, and photogenic canine! This book is great for dog lovers, photography fans, animal rescue groups, and that phun physics type. A very cheerful and interesting view of Americana--on the road with Maddie. Love, love, love it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a great game.  Unlike some where you need to spend money to get ahead, you just need to keep working.  A fun and sometimes challenging game.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I did not  know what to expect when I got this app for free, but it I an amazing app
B00821PCJS|5.0|I started watching this series on a whim and was quickly hooked! Great story line and I am always left waiting to see what happens next with every episode. It's like a good book I couldn't put down!
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|This movie is just not what I expected. From a history point of view it had a lot of content. It just did not hold my interest...
B007MJT13E|4.0|This is supposed to be the origin of the &#34;Hunter Games&#34; movie series and it is a good action movie even if the Japanese seem to make things seem funny when they are not supposed to be funny. It is a grim story like Hunger Games but without the glamour and the need for the contests to eliminate some people are not the same in both stories. Over all a good flick.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved all three! Has a great story line, romance, suspense. Very intriguing, will keep your attention most definitely!! Must read!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A refreshing parallel between individual freedom and gov't lobbyist. Dig in for a tasty literary treat.<br />Don't miss the irony
B004SH40BQ|2.0|I purchased this to use with my Phonak ComPilot.  It paired easily but lost the signal if it was in my pocket or backpack.  When it was working the music was tinny.  The volume control on the ComPilot also increased the ambient sound on the hearing aid along with increasing the volume of the music.  I returned this product and ordered the more expensive Sony product which works perfectly.  It has better sound quality, works in my pocket or pack, and the volume control only increases the volume of the music.  If you want to connect to a ComPilot buy the Sony.  You won't be disappointed.
B008VZD12K|2.0|It was not at all what we expected. It was hard to follow and somewhat boring. We were very disappointed.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|The acting is impeccable, the episodes are filled with plots and mini-plots that are all tied together in a most elegant way!  The only &#34;bummer&#34; is that we've watched all three seasons...and will have to start again, while waiting for Season 4.  WARNING!!!!:  This show is addictive...you will NOT be able to stop watching!!!
B009GED3HS|4.0|Downloaded the Amazon viewer and got a credit with my purchase.  Good quality.  Good show. Entertaining and a good option when you dont know where else to access the program.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|Mr. Buble is clearly in his element when singing the classics: You Make Me Fell So Young, Come Dance with Me, Young at Heart. Alas, the rest is just filler.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love HOGs and this one is a good one to play. I enjoyed it and i think any other casual game player would.
B0087FMUCQ|3.0|This game has potential but it gets boring after a while because you never get to play a hole of golf, only drive. The graphics are nice but wish they'd add something more, maybe the ability to hit objects like bells or the ability to break windows. Or even the ability to hit in more than one direction.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A masterpiece that never stops pleasing the viewer no matter how many times you watch it.<br />A very enjoyable experience.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Unlike some comic book/graphic novel devotees, I have always enjoyed both Marvel and DC productions.  This film is a great trilogy with both Thor and Captain America, and am definitely looking forward to more installments in this franchise.  Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston were superb in this one.  Would really liked to have seen Laurence Fishburne as Dr Fury, though!  Some great lines in this film.  Particularly liked the comparisons of Thor and Loki as demigods with the others who are super humans.  Lots of great special effects.  My only complaint is that the opening sequence is too obscure and shot too closely.  Would really have liked this opening sequence to be a little longer and with a little more clarity in the framing of The Other and his/its Chitauri.  Othewise, superb film.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|It was like the Sopranos meet Law & Order. It was also fun seeing lots of stars that now appear on new FX shows.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Over the top. Ever hear the phrase Fact is stranger than Fiction? This movie is based from a true story. Talk about and the two shall never meet.....Phew.......they met alright.....thank God.......
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is the best bond! Have already watched it 3 times since buying it! Also available on my computer.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Excellent read. For any geek age 12-52. Being a gamer is not required but it helps. A whole lot. Fini
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Lots of action but the dialogue and the plot was a little tough to follow. Enjoyed the action scenes though.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I am still amazed, even after watching this film numerous times, by just how superb a job Josh Brolin did channelling a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K !!  Was actually very disappointed that neither he nor Joseph Gordon-Levitt (channelling Bruce Willis in &#34;Looper&#34;) got noticed for awards for their brilliant work in 2012.  Also greatly enjoyed Emma Thompson's Agent O.  MiB3 has lots of interesting surprises and is a more-than-good continuation in the franchise.  Very much enjoyed the new characters (especially the aliens, though would love to have seen at least one new non-humanoid character design), and Nicole Sherzinger's hottie, Lily.  MiB is definitely on point in their own way in presenting what could very well become the sci-fi equivalent to the Bond girls, with Linda Fiorentino [Dr. Laurel Weaver] in MiB, Lara Flynn Boyle [Serleena] and Rosario Dawson [Laura] in MiB II and in this one both NIcole and Alice Eve as the youthful Agent O.  I am definitely hoping for a 4th installment in this entertaining sci-fi comedy drama - maybe they will use the Chinese ideogram for the number 4 this time??
B000JCQCW4|2.0|Maybe it's just me but this movie was not good. It has good reviews so I thought I would give it a try. It was just slow, boring, and kind of strange.
B0086HGW42|3.0|Okay it's a gorgeous album and his voice is an extraordinary instrument.  I might prefer a different collection of songs; this one is just too sweet for me. But that's a purely personal bias on my part--the guy is a great singer.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I tend to live for and within these episodes and treasure being able to view them when I wish. Thank you Amazon Primetime!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read the trilogy twice! I loved the emotional  interaction between Christian and Anastasia.  Someone told me that they weren't well written.  Neither was the Twilight series and look where that went.  I don't see how they can make it into a movie but I will be sure to see it!
B005HE5J7I|3.0|I have read Sarum and Russia by Edward Rutherfurd and was fascinated.  This one, London, not so much.  Way too much time developing fictional characters and not enough on historical characters.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is maybe, after both Dr. No and Thunderball, of course, the best in the Bond series.  What a GREAT re-boot!  Can't say there is a boring second in this film at all, and REALLY looking forward to the next installment.  Though I am a true fan of Sean as Bond, Daniel takes the role deep into Ian Flemings character as originally written.  A superb bit of filmmaking.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Wow! I knew that our food production and distribution in the USA was screwed up but this documentary revealed things that certainly made me cringe!
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Ald-J is all over the place, and they're good everywhere.  If you string these cuts into a playlist before you know them, you're going to keep checking to see which band it is.  But they're really, really musical and really, really adventurous and one of my favorite new (to me) bands of 2013.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is great! The only thing that would make it better is if it would tell the actual time on the icon so you wouldn't have to open the full program to see the time.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|I have never been a pre-order person and always looked for release week deals. A co-worker told me if you pre-order from Amazon that they guarantee you the best price from the date you place your order. I saved about 15% off my initial pre-order price. Get the movies you love, for the best price.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|I loved this story.  This one was almost as great as the first one, and I preferred it to Dragonfly in Amber.  I didn't give this 5 stars because I felt it was a little too long.  I also would have liked more of the Jaime/Claire storyline, and less of some other stuff. Some situations we're a little far fetched and I had trouble suspending my disbelief in some parts. Trying not to give out any spoilers, but the reunion scene between Claire and Jaime left me wanting.  All and all, this was a very entertaining read. Jaime is still the best book boyfriend/husband ever!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoy The Good Wife. I love the characters of Will and Alisha. It's informative as well as compelling!
B004J0PUP2|5.0|Great movie!  Great story! Great acting!  All the characters are magnificent! F.Murray Abraham's facial reactions are a treat in themselves!
B00007MF1B|2.0|First of all, the original \\"Feast of Wire\\" is one of my favorite Calexico albums, and I've owned it for years.  I was excited to get this remastered edition with the bonus tracks after I heard them on YouTube.  Other reviewers have mentioned getting 2 CDs; mine came with one and IMO the entire listening experience is ruined in the first split second - the very first note of the very first song is cut off!  To a music aficionado this is completely unacceptable!  Buy the original.  This was a waste of money.
0684803356|5.0|THIS BOOK HAS BEEN ON MY LIST SINCE I RETIRED, JUST WENT ON A CRUISE AND READ AND ENJOYED IT.
B003PAXONC|5.0|Got this on a $10 daily deal. I have never seen the film, but gave it as a gift and to get a Blu Ray package like this, I would have expected to pay at least $50.
0375869026|5.0|This was a book that made me stop and think more than once. Dare I add it to my \\"best of 2013″ list already? Quite possibly. Dare I call it a \\"must read\\" for parents and youth alike? I think so.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, the topic of people who are different from us came up while I was teaching 5th grade religious education. I asked if anyone had read ﻿Wonder﻿ and was shocked when every single student had. Apparently it's school reading already.<br /><br />Had I known how popular it was, I probably would have really had a mental resistance to reading it, but as it was, I walked into it knowing that the friend who picked it for our monthly fiction book club felt really compelled to read it. I trusted her.<br /><br />It's a book that's written from the heart and one of the things that I loved about it was the author's use of point-of-view. You don't just hear the story from the boy with the deformed face; you also get a good view of how things are for other characters in the story.<br /><br />This book invites conversation that kids want to have, though it's never easy and hugely uncomfortable. This is a book I'd encourage you to buy, because there are passages you'll want to mark. The descriptions are vivid, heart-wrenching, and so real you'll look over your shoulder.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Having seen the movie several times through the years, decided it was time to read the source.  Glad I did.  Clarke is aa good story teller who did his homework.  Have recommended it to others and will continue to do so.
1250006341|5.0|There are lots of photos of the actors and scenes from the series. The book details each of the characters and their duties.<br /><br />The many explanations of the daily life of the various servants and their routines are really eye-opening. Who does what and at what time of the day? How do things change when visitors arrive and stay for days? The 50 years of American \\"buccaneers\\" arriving was quite interesting. I have read a lot about Consuelo Vanderbilt and Winston Churchill's mother. The author's comments about the decline of the aristocrats and their estates in Britain helps those unfamiliar with the history understand the upheaval.<br /><br />As much as the series gives you a visual education about how British society functioned, the book will give you just as much regarding what did not fit into the storyline. Also you will learn about the family that the story is loosely based upon.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|This Columbus, Ohio, outfit blows me away every time I listen to the record. The radio hit, \\"Holding Onto You,\\" had me hooked and I decided that was enough to give the entire album a chance. But I was not prepared for what I heard.<br /><br />A fantastic mix of hip-hop, soul, folk and pop makes Vessel an infectious album and early frontrunner for album of the year. The best songs are eclectic: the electronic \\"Screen,\\" ukulele masterpiece \\"House of Gold,\\" and the aforementioned radio earworm \\"Holding Onto You.\\" Many of these songs appeared on their self-released 2011 record, Regional At Best, but Greg Wells' production has brought out the best in the band on Vessel`s re-recordings.<br /><br />Another song that is hard to forget is the angst-ridden \\"Car Radio,\\" written about a stolen stereo.<br /><br />I have these thoughts so often I ought to replace that slot with what I once bought 'cause somebody stole my car radio and now I just sit in silence.<br /><br />So simple, and yet so profound. This band is blessed not only with musical ability, but with the ability to take plain concepts and turn them into thought-provoking songs.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app works really good. I like it better than ice cream cake cookies pizza monkeys bananas space shuttles games for fun
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|What can I say? Josh Groban's voice is awesome. I love the fact that he collaborates with various writers and on this record he had a different producer. I love that he's bending his talent and reaching out to new and different realms with his singing.
B00881PTRC|4.0|This is probably the rummest version of hangman I have ever played. I like the little animation. You do have to know a LOT about the category that you picked, but it is amazing!!! I even got it for free on the free app of the day! :)
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|I thought this was another well done DC animated movie.  It was darker than usual, but it did a good job of bringing to screen the graphic comics version I read years ago.  Keep them coming, Bruce Timm!
B0035JLVWY|5.0|Loved it, A show with some excitement and keeps your attention through the entire thing.  He is a fabulous actor
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|More than forty years since its initial release, Albert King's Born Under A Bad Sign still stands as one of the greatest blues collections in history. Backed by Booker T. & the MG's, King wails on the classic title track, \\"The Hunter,\\" and \\"I Almost Lost My Mind.\\" Stax really delivers by including five previously unreleased bonus tracks on this re-issue, featuring an additional verse on \\"Crosscut Saw\\" and an untitled instrumental composition to close the album.<br /><br />Deanie Parker's original liner notes are included, as well as Michael Point's notes from the 2002 reissue and a new introduction written for this edition by Bill Dahl. Remastered albums that do not offer anything new are an insult to fans, and Stax evidently recognizes this. The company has done a great job in bringing Albert King's music into the 21st century, complete with new treats for longtime fans of the blues master.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|This is a well written and streamlined book and definitely worth picking up.  It definitely challenges the paradigm of big business and if you want to wake up from your Fortune 500 coma and get insights as to why you're not nimble, read this book.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Can't imagine even using anything else. First thing I've done with all my new phones is get SwiftKey on it. Didn't think I'd be a fan of Flow, but it's incredible and intuitive and have been using it a lot in certain situations. 100% worth the money. You will feel great about buying this app, makes life so much easier.
1451696191|2.0|This book had been given to be by a friend, and when I first received it I was very excited. However, as I began reading, I found the book was very hard to relate to, I am an honor student in the tenth grade, and I love reading. Being in high school and being older than the main character I found the events exaggerated and frankly they didn't peak my interest at all. This book is mainly about sex and drugs. I am sure many found this compelling, I however, was not able to find the subject interesting.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Continuing on its path of excellence the characters continue to grow and change. The court cases continue to be relevant and interesting. A worthwhile watch!
B000MVN8GK|5.0|All 3 seasons of Veronica Mars were great--I was sad for it to end so abruptly. I'm excited for the anticipated movie coming out in 2014.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|An excellent movie to watch with your family.  A movie that challenges men to be real men, godly men.  The movie has a good story line.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|If you know one thing about Tarantino its that he knows how to make a quality movie that entertains. QT is the one guy I can trust to put out a great movie that rises above all the crap hollywood dishes out.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app for weather. Love the real time accuracy. Very easy to use app. Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a weather app.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This season is more enjoyment from the folks who call Downton Home and the people who work to make it all possible.  If you love Downton, you'll like this.
B004B8DH98|3.0|Seems like a trend in movies is to make bad people into heros.  The whole concept is quite disturbing.  It makes murderers socially acceptable.  Not a good thing.
B008OOYALE|4.0|So far, it's very cute and simple. Grow and nurture your dragons so you can breed them and get more, eventually creating different dragon types.  Visit neighbors to earn money so you can pay for food to feed your new pets.
B004SIP7PS|5.0|It's a wonderful romantic movie that gives some insite to the Barrie -- the writer of Peter Pan.  Of course it helped having Johnny Depp in it!
141659521X|5.0|I hope in three and a half years we can  replace Napolitano with Vince Flynn as Secretary of Home Land Security.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|Good story line with great actors- see it and you will agree. Great city film with great camera work and story line. Book was good too.
B00160FBWK|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Performances are great and effects used don't overshadow what's happening in each scene. A rare really good sequel!
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|My daughter loves this game. She played nonstop for about a half hour when I first showed it to her, which is a long time for a 2.5 year old!! The only bad thing I can say is that the watering can is a bit tricky sometimes. I even have trouble getting it to pour sometimes. Other than that minor issue, great game!!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Ms. Rowell is able to capture two voices, both authentic yet unique, and alternate them as the story of budding first love unfolds. The result, because of that authenticity, is neither precious or annoying, but achingly real and palpable. Add in complications of family disfunction--also brought out in an authentic way, and you have a recipe for perfection. I loved every word in this book. I laughed, cried, and ached. First love is electric with all the feels, and so is this book.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|Having seen the Les Miserables on stage several times, I was disappointed.  The music was lost in the huge movie sets.  Not that the primary characters didn't have fine voices, but it's the difference between a singer that can act and an actor that can sing.  I prefer the former.  The only exceptions were Marius and Eponine -- they were excellent.  &#34;Master of the House&#34;, which should have been the comedy relief, was disgusting.  The stage show is about the music and the story -- the movie is about the scenery and the sets.  I will probably not watch it again -- instead I will watch the 25th Anniversary version of stage show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A very fun game. I once played this game for four hours. it is the best game ever. download this game if you like fun.  I like it because you can compete with other horses
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Does a wonderful just of presenting the world from a teenage perspective of someone growing up on the autistic spectrum.  The main character is very compelling.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is a very fun yet challenging game! I enjoying playing it! I get consumed with the game and have to put it down for awhile! :) there are more levels to come and I'm excited!!!
B0090X4GJE|4.0|I just fell in L00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000vvvvvvVEEEEEE  WITH THAT SIN<br /><br />US AND SEXY AS HELL BODY and you were right  of course.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Great talent and plot. We did something we never do....watched it twice!....it was that good. We also saw the play when it was on Broadway in New York.
B00000IQW5|5.0|This is a fun, romantic and touching story -- I also loved the scenery!  I've been to Kalispel, Montana, several times -- it's a beautiful part of the country!
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|Fun for kids and for the whole family.  Bought this to put into a movie night basket for housewarming gift for a friend and her daughter and they both loved it.
B00BYKIKJS|4.0|I love Jennifer Lawrence and she made this movie that much better. great acting and a funny twisted plot. I definitely recommend this to others
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I love cooking and always want to try something new and easy since I am a single male living alone.  Great book and great buy.
B00498YZH8|5.0|It's unbelievable what these people put family through to save their own neck. The movie was realistic and held your interest.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|The story line was easier to follow than the theater play, but the singing quality not as good as in the theater.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Cinematically stunning.<br />Incredible acting.<br />Exciting multi-leveled story -- loved the conversations<br />Theologically flawed but does pull the viewer towards God<br />rather than away from Him.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I love these headphones for in the gym because they stay in my ears and they have decent sound quality.  However, I've gone through 3 pairs this past year.  The wire on one side always comes loose.  I do leave them in my gym bag, so that might have something to do with it, but it's not like I'm throwing my gym bag around or having to yank the headphones out my the cord.  I can not ever really recall a specific event preceding the loose wire.  However, I've tried buds of all sorts, 100$ bose headphones, the clip on ones and the headphones that go behind your head and I haven't found one that sits in my ears as nicely as these.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I like but it is only ok. It is fun for a while but then it get boring, I feel like I am doing the same thing over and over. It is fun it just gets old.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love games that make you think and this one did not disappoint me at all. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|We don't normally watch animated but this one was recommended and we really enjoyed it. I would recommend it for anyone.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I watched with a lot of attention, good story line, but a bit violent, not for the weak of heart.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|love it! exciting fun. great graphics awesome good time for the whole family to enjoy. Would recommend it to everyone
B004SIP9RO|5.0|This is my all time favorite light hearted romantic comedy of all time.  I am 51 years old and have seen tons of these types of movies....this one is the best by far!  It's sweet, romantic and unique.  Not your 'run of the mill' love story!!<br /><br />I think I'll watch it again now that I've written this review!
B0063M22QO|5.0|My son (11 yrs) and I love to play this together.  It's a lot of fun!  Keeps our brain fresh &amp; keeps us sharp and thinking.  I definitely recommend it for all ages.
B002W7J3SO|4.0|This movie is considered a classic, and I can see why. It has a few twists and turns and keeps you entertained. The characters are interesting and I overall enjoyed it.
B001UEBHYS|1.0|I only made it through about the first 45 minutes so maybe it improved but in that first 45 minutes we see:<br /><br /> *the children's family murdered in front of them<br /> *a child locked in an outhouse from the outside and he must come from underneath<br /> *children living in a dump (I mean an actual dump not just a run down apartment I mean a literal waste dump)<br /> *hot chili peppers dumped on a naked boy's penis,as the other children chant, \\"chillis on his willy\\"<br />**and children sold into slavery,<br />******and when it came time to pluck the kids's eyes out I took the DVD out and broke it in half and threw it away!<br /><br />Now yes I know things like this really do happen in real life, but can't they make a documentary about it instead?
B0002KVUKM|5.0|LOVE this movie but its pretty sad how in the end the girl dies trying to save Van Helsing. ALL AROUND I'LL RATE A 5!
B006GECE9Y|4.0|This is my primary browser. I have tried several and this one is the most reliable and fastest. I use it on an older tablet and this is the best performer I have found.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love this show, keeps you captivated and what is better than good entertainment and history all rolled into one. Can't wait for<br />the next season
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful and brilliant and funny and heartbreaking and possibly the best thing I've read in years.<br /><br />I may never recover.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I told my friend that I wished I could get amnesia so I could read the book again and experience it one more time.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|i picked this book based on the amazon review. i didn't know what to expect. i read the whole thing in a couple of days. i woke up at 4am thinking about the book and read until my alarm went off. great writing. great story. i never read anything quite like it.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|I can't stop listening to this cd! One of their best, very sexy. I already bought my tickets to see them live this fall!
B007NZQU72|5.0|It is really interesting to know how a person becomes highly sensitive to their world.  I am thinking of signing my name and putting HSP afterwards, like a degree.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This has to be one of the best shows on TV. I hope that there will be more to the first season and that a consideration for many<br />more seasons is on the burner.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is much better than the first version, I only wish it had a better soundtrack and sounds.that's all
1609611543|5.0|We watch Bill O'Reilly on FNC. He mentioned it as a good guide. He was right. My wife has lost weight and feels better too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have a kindle fire HD... and I love this app endless playing time and sooooooooooo many levels. I really do love this app.
B003629IPW|5.0|THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER MICHAEL JACKSON NOR THERE WILL BE AN IMITATOR TO MATCH HIS PERFORMANCE. LONG LIVE MICHAEL
B00AIJP9BS|1.0|Not really with any money.  Controls are not as they should be, and it is not enjoyable.  Though it sounds like a great idea
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great movie I really like the acting by don Johnson. I thought Jamie foxx only said 10 words but it worked!!
B00AFEXRME|4.0|We enjoyed watching it but was a little unsatisfied because of some of the bad language which was really not needed to make it a great movie...we love Danzel
B0020BUWX2|4.0|This was a lovely book.  It was both sad and uplifting.  Death is easy.  Life is hard.  What would you choose?
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|it is the best game ever. you get to play as a shark but it deletes all data saved when updates
B009NG1Q96|5.0|It made me cry and laugh I could not put it down that is why I finished in one day can't wait till the next book
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a very well written bok and was so inspiring.  It held your interest and I always hated to put it down when I had somethng else to do.  Job well done.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the graphics they are way cool there's only one monster&hellip; flames&hellip; spiney spinny thingys&hellip; and ziplines what more could you ask for
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Funny, sort of suspenseful, kept me guessing until the end. McConaughey was awesome in this film. He played the character well and had great delivery. Enjoyable and entertaining film.
B0081336FO|4.0|I did like Season 2, just not as much as Season 1.  The Hound of the Baskervilles episode is really creepy! Don't watch it alone at night.  I am looking forward to Season 3, but I hope it will be a little lighter, with more humor, like Season 1 was.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|THE best retelling of the Arthurian legend with a close second to Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy.  I have read countless versions of the story of King Arthur but Bradley's is by far my favorite.  Told from the women's perspective (Morgaine, Igraine etc..) it really shed a different and unique light on the well-known tale.  I remember reading it about 15 years ago and being surprised because it looked initially to me like a romance novel.  I was pushed to read it by a number of people and finally broke down.  I'm glad that I did because Bradley's writing is crisp, vivid, and her depictions of the military battles were on a par with the best historians and novelists who have covered this subject.  Please don't judge this book by the dainty cover, this is a tremendous book that ranks among my favorites.  If you are looking for a great read that doesn't make you feel like you wasted your money and you are a fan of anything Arthurian, pick this up and read it today.  It won't disappoint you.
B009MYARIK|5.0|First I have to say I am a huge Sophie Kinsella fan so I may be biased. I loved this book. Finished it in one day
1442359315|5.0|I listened to the tapes and found them very stimulating. Perhaps this was not heaven, but that his experience was<br />authentic I have no doubt. Thankful to have heard it. His reading of the book was special.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|Am still assessing the product but have been impressed at the range and variety of questions to which it responds appropriately and accurately.
B00881PTRC|4.0|This game is my favourite android version of hangman. It has excellent category choices (like the expected animals or places but also several categories of SAT words which are very helpful for your teens.) It is well made with no freezes on my Razr Maxx. I liked the animations and the choices of themes as well.<br /><br />A couple things I'd like changed: on the main screen change the font color of play, options, etc as its hard to see on the default doodle theme. Also add in a ticker that tells you how many tries you get or let us pick our try count. And add in a word difficulty level so younger people can play and win.<br /><br />Very solid game. Good job!
1451695195|5.0|I have read several near death accounts, and this book by Eben Alexander is the more inspirational, and ------  well, believable.  Not that I necessarily doubt other accounts, but  Dr. Alexander comes from an extraordinary intelligent,  scientific perspective and knowledge of the brain.  His history, and experience are astounding.  I highly recommend this book for every believer, and every doubter!
0375703764|2.0|I keep hearing from people who give this book glowing reviews, that it makes you work.  It doesn't lay everything out for you, you have to work for the payoff.  Well guess what?  Call my lazy, crazy, or whatever you wish, but I don't want to have to work that hard to enjoy a book.  I work really hard at my job and at raising my 2 year-old daughter.  When I crack open a book, I want to put myself and the experience in the hands of the author and let them take me for the ride.  I don't want them to pull over every 10 miles or so and ask me to take the wheel for a while.  Perhaps i'm in the minority, but I just didn't appreciate the hoops that I had to jump through to fully appreciate the artistry of Mark Z. Danielewski.  The story was a good one, but the constant effort of having to read certain pages in the reflection of a mirror, or having to turn the page upside-down, or having to decode large portions of pages like I was running an Enigma machine in World War II, was just too much for me to take.  I appreciate the effort Mr. Danielewski but I don't want to \\"work for it\\", I just want to sit back and enjoy a good story and escape for a few hours a day.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I would rather read this in book form I think. It was a long, slow, gloomy two hours. I can't imagine why every one is raving over it so much. The songs are slow, and there are no tunes to take away and it was shot mostly in the dark so I had to do a lot of guessing as to what was happening. I am not a fan of this type of singing. The emotional content was well done. I was touched but I would have been more touched if the movie was 40 minutes shorter.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Characters and plot lines (well the characters he lets live) just keep on getting better, can't wait for the next one
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Incredible all the calculations it can do but to fully utilize its capabilities one has to read the instructions and develop the appropriate skill set.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Excellent and challenging hangman app for all. Maybe a little too difficult for those under eight or so. Great faotd and worth a buck any day.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Naive and exaggerated in the plot, but kids loved it! They wanted watch it over and over again. Great family movie.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|I watched this movie a million times as a kid and my girlfriend had never seen it so we rented it and she loved it as well.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I like this show much more than Suits which I thought was clever and high drama about the 1 percent..  This other show is more for us 99 percent, and satisfies.
0007466064|4.0|I pretty much blazed through the first four books - this one is taking me a lot longer to read but it is great.

B00421IR5I|5.0|J'aime ce film de Petit Nicolas. Les soutitres sont bons et le francais est fantastique. Je vais le regarder une fois encore.
B0030A0ZD4|2.0|most of this film is a re-tread of michael's career in the form of a long collage of old videos chopped to pieces and jazzed up with colorful frames, but i'd prefer seeing whole videos or something new.<br /><br />the new part, moonwalker, is a short film that includes the video of smooth criminal. it's a slow-paced, and michael's acting is truly embarrassing.<br /><br />his &#34;this is it&#34; video is slow in places too, but it's new material that gives a real glimpse into his life and personality. and it demonstrates the tragedy of a stupendous talent spoiled by being surrounded by a shocking degree of ass-kissing. no wonder he got weird with nobody in his life to give him honest feedback.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|A great story, and to be honest I wish this was happening now.  You should read this, and take it to heart.

B0099G6Q5E|2.0|I was expecting the songs to be longer, but most of them were very short. They were literally as long as they were in the movie... I'm bummed I wasted my $8.
B00969GFFU|1.0|WOW! I had to read this for my book group and was the last to start it. Several people warned me about how bad this was, but I decided to reat it anyway.  Was totally blown away by the level of bad.  Bad writing, bad character developement, horrible story line, rambling.... misogynistc...unfinished story lines....  SHEESH!  Just plain painful to read! AND 600 pages!!!! I have heard his first book is so much better, but so not willing to risk the read.  The disconnect between the inner thoughts and the actions of the characters was so sharp it made my face scrunch up as I was reading it trying to reconcile what I had just read.  Okay. Nuff said.  Seriously don't bother unless you want to be compelled to write a review to warn others NOT to read this book.  Wish I had listened to my friends.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A friend told me that I HAD to read this book by Kate Morton.  I am so glad I listened to her as it was super!
B000FA675C|5.0|Read the book before seeing the movie. Like all of Robert Ludlum's novels it is a great read. I highly recommend this book as well as any of his other novels.
B0026KX5PO|3.0|It was watchable but I know I would not tell anyone it was a must see. Look for another movie to watch
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this a lot for stuff like YouTube video ideas, lyrics, and other stuff.<br />If you need to get this on the go, get it! I love it, two thumbs up! :)
1609611543|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend and I'm glad I bought it, and read it!  WB provides a good explanation of how our bodies process food...scary and elightening at the same time! HIGHLY recommended reading.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This should be required reading for gamers! A great read! It's rare that a book will cause me to cheer out loud and this one did.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The detailings and character descriptions were amazing.  The story twisted and turned in ways you thought you knew-but-ahha nope.  Great novel, wonderful read.
B005PK57NU|4.0|If you like lawyer process shows, you'll enjoy the Good Wife.<br />If you're considering Season 3, you already know that. :)<br />Season 3 brings some fun new tensions, reconciliations and contemporary case material to the show that makes it a rich, rewarding watch.<br />Margulies continues to solidly headline the show in a clear, accessible, powerful way.<br />Go strong women!
B00BWU2EMO|1.0|Couldn't wait for this movie to come out . It played out like dick Tracy . Totally inaccurate and laughable. These gangsters lives are interesting enough to hold an audience I don't know why they have to embellish these gangster with a bunch of inaccurate crap. Total Garbage
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Thank you,  Barbara Demick for sharing North Korea in an objective, poignant manner.  This book leaves me astounded and sad.  As I prepared my bagel and hot tea for breakfast this morning,  I couldn't help but feel a degree of shame.  Rather than a global view of North Korean life, the author brings the personal challenges and experiences of the people.  I wish the book had taken me right up until today and the reign of Kim Jung-un.  I highly recommend that you read this book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|New versions have sometimes taken some adjusting to, but in two years this app changed the way I manage life...personal and professional

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Easier then candy crush!  But not has addictive! Not sure y but this game is my second to play when run out of lives on candy crush!
B009C7JS14|1.0|Since this app does not ID where I am and seems to have no way to change that, it is useless to me. I imagine the paid version is better but I wouldn't chance it. VERY disappointed.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|I've enjoyed.This.series.off.and.on.for.years.and have to say Lee  Child's continues to keep it.interesting.  If you haven't read any.of this series I'm sure.you'll enjoy this book.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I know it's easy to find books on Amazon and kindle now but I'm so glad to have found this series. Great writing style, great character build. Story that needs 10 more books to be told. I don't even know how to write reviews but just had to for this series.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|My grandchildren love this game and asked me to get it for them.  The girls twins are 4 & their sister is 8.
B0027MJU00|5.0|My first book by Gillian Flynn.  I really enjoyed it. Lots of twists and turns. I kind of wished there was a little more at the end.  More closure.
B005DJREJS|5.0|A great show that brings you back to high school no matter how old you are. Can't wait to get season 2 on Prime.
B000V6AD46|4.0|Brings back fond memories of the past.  I never brought an Skynyrd music till now.  But i did rock out to it in the car.
B009V3KKXY|1.0|I would not recommend this book. The instructions I found on line were much better. This did not show good enough pictures, or give good enough instructions, if you are a beginner. The steps were not laid out in a easy to copy form.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Magnificent! Craig is a gifted writer. I will read all of his novels. Easy reading and tough to put down.

B00BV2M9LO|3.0|Here are the plusses:<br />--It is hard to put down.<br />--It is scientifically interesting, and, presumably, scientifically authentic.<br /><br />Here are the minuses:<br />--Not much variety in mood--crisis after crisis.<br />--Lousy characterization.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|How can anyone not love this movie. I am a lover of the show. I agree that some of the singing is not as &#34;wonderful&#34; as the show, but these people are supreme actors first. The brought their characters to life. There are t imes that I feel the need to get involved with something and this movie always comes out.
B003DCJA94|5.0|Can't believe that Blowup was released in 1967.  Except for the women's &#34;fashions&#34; (always a tipoff), it could be released today.  Well, there's that old Rolls-Royce and nobody uses film today, and the free guiltless sex--but who cares?  The message--that nothing is what it seems and nothing is ever completed--still resonates.  Cinematography is superb, as it should be in a film about a photographer.  Antonioni at his best.
B003U51D58|5.0|Watched the series from the beginning. Had a real twist at the end of the series. A little confusing, I liked how you can watch old TV shows on Amazon
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really loved it, it was very interesting, I will suggest this book to teenagers also. I will like to thank the writer
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|Read the book. It is wonderful. The movie is boring and so not faithful to the book plot.  Why Peter, why?
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is the same calculator that the iPod uses. I needed a calculator for algebra and this one works just fine.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I really enjoyed the style of this book. The story switches between the present day an the early years of World War 2 in England. The tragic circumstances that took Viviene from her home in Australia to a cold and uncaring uncle set the scene for a tale of love lost and found for both Viviene and her neighbour Dorothy and Dorothy's fiancé Jimmy. Dorothy is at the end of her days and wants to make a clean breast of her life. Her daughter Laurel sets out to find the truth. Slowly the story of the three is revealed with a twist at the end. Overall an easy and enjoyable read.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|I &#34;watched&#34; for 10 minutes then switched on &#34;Four Weddings and a Funeral.&#34;  It seems all you need at pitch meetings anymore is<br />lots of titillation (9th grade level), dirty words (7th grade level) and angst (5th grade level).  Take one schlubby guy with gorgeous wife and you're living every producer and writer's dream.  I hated it from hello, we're taking a shower together.  Wow.
B005NJFSZK|5.0|I bought this to add to my son's collection of cars. Nice weight to it and goes with the other die cast cars from the movie.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|The ending left one feeling a little empty - otherwise another brilliant book! I guess the 4th one is in production
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Soo good get as soon as you can made me cry this story will touch your heart love it a lot
B009IUH1N2|4.0|This game is fun, but addictive, it was eating up my life until I finished the game. I can't say anything on the price though it was a free app of the day deal.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I like how this app displays the news. Nice overview, easy access and I can choose which categories get displayed. I also like that I can read articles when I am offline (the ones that were downloaded when I was last online). Very nice.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Has all the weather info I want and need - love the graphs - but I can't remove the temperature display from the notifications bar.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Plain and simple, it wasn't what I was looking for.  I've given it a try, but will soon be deleting it from my Kindle cuz it's just not my cup of tea.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I just started using this app, so my review will be brief... I am already having loading issues and constant pop up ads to purchase other games and/or items, which is highly irritating, but I do love the graphics and challenging game play. For now I give it a &quot;3&quot;, but this may change in the future, either way, depending on how I feel after playing for a length of time.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I learned a lot of new words, so this book was a challenging read, but it was all worthwhile! I enjoyed it. The book is just as good as the movie.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I used to enjoy playing hangman with my friends at school in my childhood days and I must admit Ultimate Hangman HD android made my day! I love the animation of the hangman character and I love the ability for 2 player mode so you can enter your own words and play with a friend.<br /><br />Kudos to the developer for making this Hangman word game. Definitely worth 99c - download it today and you will be thrilled and entertained for hours if you love word games.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I recently finished the book, which is one of my favorite books of all time. I couldn't put it down! Of course then I wanted to see the movie. The movie was very good, and I enjoyed it very much. But, the book has so many more details than the movie did, which helped to make the book so much better and those details added a lot to the story and the characters in the book. There were some differences in the story itself between the book & movie---Like how Minnie found out that Celia was pregnant, for example.<br />The book was written so well--That it left cliffhangers  at the end of each chapter. I didn't see any cliffhangers in the movie, and not just because I already read the book, but because there weren't any.<br />The only reason I'm giving four instead of five stars is because of the difference between the book & the movie, and finding the book to be better. If I hadn't read the book, I'm certain I would have liked the movie more than I did. But, it was still a very good movie that I liked very much, and I definitely recommend it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Can't wait for the next installment with Daniel Craig in less than 2 years. One of the best in the Bond series!
B004QX07G4|1.0|I adore Ellen Degeneres, but this book was obviously an afterthought! The stories are a bad attempt at venetes. Writing was so disjointed I was forced to re-read repeatedly.<br />Being a book lover getting lost in the story is the whole point. Unfortuntly, it's not possible with this book.
0782010792|5.0|As most people acknowledge, these are great films.  At our house it is traditional to play them during the Christmas holidays.<br /><br />As our VCR version was of poor quality, I am very happy with the DVD version.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love the concept of this book and the plot was well written. This book was just as good as the movie, but probably even better than the movie!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use my yahoo email everyday, so to have it on my Kindle was a must. Love the fact that every time I use my Kindle, my emails are there and it never crashes or freezes on me(knock on wood) lol<br />Great app, no complaints!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome book! Keeps your interest and is written in a very intriguing way! I love how the chapters go back and forth between the two different main characters and tells each of their stories from a different perspective! I am in the middle of the book right now, and it is awesome!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Loved, loved, loved the ending. Just brilliant!! Looking forward to reading more from Gillian Flynn. True fan.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Yann Martel has a winner here! Complicated,  and hear wrenchingly real. Looking forward to more of Martel's work. A must read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did not like the language at all though.  I have to mentally change words in my head, but was enjoying the story so I kept readying.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I liked how the descriptions were so vivid and lively. I love how this book keeps me wanting to read more of it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is a Godsend. It's very loud and actually makes me wake up. lol I have a nasty habit of hitting the snooze button on my phone and going back to sleep, but with this app, I cannot go back to sleep because I'm afraid it'll just scare the hell out of me again lmfao<br />VERY good app!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|1.) Not impressed.<br />2.) laughed twice during the whole movie.<br />3.) Really needed some more chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis.<br /><br />Dont waste your money
B003XX2PD6|5.0|This is my first introduction to Deerhunter though I'd heard of them before here and there. Wow! As soon as I played track 1 (Earthquake), I was hooked. Just lilting, addictive and so unusually pleasant to listen to! I think Deerhunter calls themselves ambient punk and that's a great term. Besides Earthquake, also loved Don't Cry and Helicopter. Amazing and original album!!!! Nice change from the other junk out there.
B000W9399S|5.0|The book that started the Discworld series. Pratchett takes you on an adventure like no other, with hilarious twists and turns, wonderful characters, and a great story. Pratchett is very much the Douglass Adams of the fantasy genre, if you enjoyed his works I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy this.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Glued to it, (which is rare), I couldn't and didn't want to put it down.

B0087IT8FK|5.0|An unexpected delight.<br />I had rented this movie, but because I loved it, I decided to buy and add to my movie collection.<br />Very poignant story but told in a funny way.
B00B1CGDTS|5.0|It was so much clearer. I love Maureen so I love all her movies.I waiting for Parent Trap in Blu-ray
B00004XQ83|5.0|Loved the movie and the music so I had to have this soundtrack.<br />I play it to get me motivated and who can stay still when your feet are tapping<br />along.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|The outfits are beautiful, and the dances very graceful.  Whoever made Ms Knightley's gowns should be pinned to death.  Terrible fit.  Gowns and the dances are the ONLY things worth seeing in this movie.  The 'play' atmosphere makes it seem very unreal and is disjointed, the continuity horrid and the movie will make you remember those awful chores that no-one wants to do - and you'll WANT to do them, just to have an 'excuse' to kill this movie.  You just can't get \\"into\\" this movie, and it is no 'escape' from your day to day life.  Movies are supposed to make you feel a part of it, as though you are living it - this one fails miserably.<br /><br />Truly awful and an unforgivable waste of time and energy.
0670026557|5.0|SUMMARY:<br /><br />Dr. Adam Grant's new book, Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success, provides a masterclass on the concept of generosity. If you're already a natural giver, you'll be fascinated by his research on the science behind the psychology of giving. And if you've based your behavior around reciprocity, it will give you insights into the benefits of generous (but smart) behavior. I recommend this book as a must-read.<br /><br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK:<br /><br />Give and Take is a much needed book, and I think it'll make a big impact on two types of people:<br /><br />* Help givers understand how to be more successful with otherish mindsets (and minimize their downside risks)<br />* Encourage \\"socialized takers\\" to try the give-first mindset<br /><br />Dr. Adam Grant teaches at The Wharton School; he earned a Ph.D. in organizational psychology; and he has an impressive publication record. In this book, he has translated powerful (but sometimes dry) research into clearly illustrated ideas which are often very actionable. I recommend this book as a must read if you want to be successful in today's interconnected world, where you can't get anything done on your own. You need to understand otherish behaviors, so that you can give generously and receive much-needed help.<br /><br />KEY TAKEAWAYS:<br /><br />Give and Take makes a very compelling case for generosity as a baseline behavior, because it:<br /><br />* Offers a very thoughtful (and accessible) exploration on the science of generosity<br />* Explains how givers can experience burnout and recover from it. (I've been there and felt it.)<br />* Provides a new vocabulary to articulate things you may already instinctively knew about human behavior (takers, fakers, matchers, selfless, and otherish)<br />* Makes complex research very accessible (academic journal articles tend to be dry, even when they contain brilliant work!)<br /><br />MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE BOOK<br /><br />The New York Times Magazine featured an excellent article about Dr. Grant and his book, so I ordered the book. A few days later, I started flipping through it at about 8:30 p.m., just after dinner. I was hooked by both the concepts and the clear writing. I didn't put the book down until after 2 a.m., when I finished it.

1577314808|5.0|I read The New Earth a few years ago.  It really resonated with me at the time and I often referred to it when I needed some perspective,  The Power of Now is another book that I will go back to often.  Sometimes life moves forward so quickly and it is easy to get carried away in the drama.  This book gives me a way to stop the madness and find balance.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I saw the movie first and enjoyed the nearly original plot and concept. I was intrigued enough to want to read the basis for the movie.<br />What I really liked about Ms. Collins book was that it never wavered from the first person narrative of the main character, Katniss Everdeen. What I wasn't crazy about was the exposition as told through Katniss' thoughts and words. As anyone knows, we don't think in exposition. So the telling felt a little false. Also, the writing is clearly not meant for adults.<br />It's a lot like watching a great movie and the suspension of disbelief is complete. You are totally immersed in the telling and viewing. The not-so-great movies can't do that for you. You are always thinking about the acting, the not so plausible plot twists, the problems in continuity, etc. This book falls into the not-so-great category. Fun but flawed.<br />I give it three-and-half stars.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So glad it was free. With large print, easy to read and user friendly!! Thanks. Do you have one for calculus?

B005HEVBGG|4.0|I had only watched some of Star Trek Voyager when it was on in the early & mid-90's.  I always enjoyed it, but had not seen it from the beginning.  Watching Season One has been very enjoyable and I highly recommend it.  Most of the episodes were very well written and the crew has a good chemistry that is forming.  I have added Season Two to my watch list and will continue with it since I enjoyed this season so much.  I really enjoy Kate Mulgrew as Captain.  She's a strong leader and also a total babe!

B00B89WXYS|4.0|OneRepublic's third album, \\"Native,\\" reels in the bombast of the last album, \\"Waking Up.\\" In its place are smooth synths, grand choruses and bandleader Ryan Tedder's soulful voice. He's also a songwriter who has his ears glued to what makes a current hit (he counts Rhianna, Beyonce and Maroon 5 among his successes), so \\"Native\\" sounds like, well, most of the melodic pop singles of the day.<br /><br />This is not a bad thing. A really good pop band (say, Maroon 5) can get in your ear canal and fill your day with a fair amount of joy. OneRepublic wants you to have a great day. They trade in on the previously mentioned bands, while obviously paying attention to the success of Mumford and Sons with a string plucked optimistic anthem titled \\"I Lived.\\" Any similarities to M&S's \\"I Will Wait\\" are completely noncoincidental. Yet there are those huge hooked poptunes like the single \\"If I Lose Myself,\\" or \\"Something I Need,\\" which build off melodies before bursting into powerful choruses.<br /><br />Tedder and OneRepublic are an eager to please bunch. \\"Native\\" is the kind of pop that you'll get from the likes of Maroon 5, The Fray and, when they're feeling really ambitious, Coldplay. By reigning in the tendency to over-produce (my main argument with \\"Waking Up), he may have the best album he and his band-mates have turned in to date.
B004WPJHJ4|4.0|It's a classic John Wayne western, and I enjoy most of the Duke's later westerns, but I particularly like his partnership with Maureen O'Hara. This isn't my favorite... that's Rio Bravo with Dean Martin, but I love it for the relationship between the Duke and Dean, and the music!

B000P2A256|5.0|Great album!  Lots of great songs!  Worth it!!  You will not be disappointed with this album if you are a Maroon 5 fan!
B004GYY714|2.0|I could not shut down this app without completely shutting down my Kindle. Naturally I uninstalled it. I did not even see any way to shut it down from any control input. It just keeps using bandwidth all the time. Maybe not so good for Kindles?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great English adventure. The characters are well developed and believable.  Each hour leaves you wanting for more. I enjoy watching it whenever I have a minute.  What a time to be living especially at the castle
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have recommended this book to others as it was a great read.  The ending really shocked me.  I will definitely be reading more by this author.
B0060D0HJK|5.0|This joyously believable movie has cinematography, laughs, romance,  and a good story line with good actors that star in it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|love it  the best thing for a free app and works great cant get any better than this app love it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My friends kept telling me to watch it but I resisted because I'm not a fan of zombie shows. That changed quickly. I watched the first 2 seasons in 3 days. I would start an episode of season 3 at bed time and the cliffhanger at the end was so intriguing I had to watch the next one and before I knew it, it was 2 a.m. and I'd watched several episodes. great story, great characters, love it.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in a long time.  I had been waiting for the first movie in the trilogy to be released seperately since I didn't really like the others.  This release is awesome.  Even though the movie is old, the audio and video hold up VERY well.  The picture quality is amazing.  The audio is even better.  The bass when the t-rex stomps is deafening.  The dinosaurs screaming is pure hell.  I cannot recommend this blu ray enough.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great for kids to learn math skills and special relationships. Don't let them play it late at night, they won't be able to sleep, it wakes the brain up!
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|I remember this album when I was 21. I enjoyed this album. I still listen to it. This album is a sharp and witty pop-rock gem filled with candid tales of neurotic ex-boyfriends, crazy road trips with friends, and figuring out who you are along the way. Since the album displayed her feisty, girl-power swagger, It also revealed her more vulnerable side on such regretful ballads. This album shows different sides and colors of her as a songwriter. This album has been certified Platinum.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Might just be my favorite show of all time! Talented actors, gorgeous setting, thoroughly engaging plot! Already on to Season 3.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|love it  the best thing for a free app and works great cant get any better than this app love it
B0064MPXFA|5.0|very well done, each episode shows you how cases can be won or lost, I look forward to each time I am going to watch the next chapter.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Easy to set up and use. Works best and fastest with two peaple, one a slide handler, and the other a device user. That way, you can fly through hundreds of slides in an hour. Picture quality looks bad on the little viewer, but good on an HD TV.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|Observe all the permissions. You get what you pay for. If you don't mind sharing everything there is to know about you (and your friends) this is a great app.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Very quick to download but the only thing wrong is the annoying pop ups and online adds that keep coming on. It's really annoying so much that I'm going to delete it in favor of another solitare product.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|such awesome instrumental and vocal tracks. really adds to the mood of the game. i really enjoy jamming to the music
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love it  the best thing for a free app and works great cant get any better than this app love it
B00AYM6JFO|3.0|This was &#34;ok&#34; but not as good as his other music albums.  The songs are well-known, but this just wasn't what fans would expect in the style of Willie Nelson's &#34;normal&#34; way of singing.  I liked the previous album released prior to this issue much better.  I don't recommend this album very highly at all.
B009POHHR6|5.0|5stars for the way it ended. Wouldn't Want to ruin the end of if. Also the way batman was done.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Love this show and being able to watch it on my kindle with no commercials is awesome! Would recommend this show to everyone who loves suspense!
B007L5KT76|5.0|I loved this one just as much as the first movie!  The end seemed to leave an opening for another movie - fingers crossed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Had not read Grisham in a couple of years - last book we read was just so-so and we got started on Tom Clancy and some others.  Decided to give this one a try based on other reviews and it was a really good read.  More humor than I remember in previous Grisham books!  I love the sparse or very little vulgar language - we read while traveling - husband drives and I read.  He loves books on tape, but I am very visual and need to see the words to follow the book.  There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the very end without becoming tedious!  We've backed up to his 2011 book, The Litigators, and are reading that  - about halfway done and it is totally different and yet very enjoyable and still lawyer based.
B006DHAT5K|4.0|I went to see this in the theaters when it first came out and really enjoyed it, hence the reason I purchased the DVD.  I'ts funny and most women will be able to relate to it.  Definitely a CHICK FLICK!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I didnt love all of the characters all of the time, had a mix of feelings but could not put it down. Easy read.
0788812408|3.0|A little cloudy picture in the beginning but it looks better within 20 minutes of the movie. It was a great price and we love the movie
B000FA675C|5.0|Took some time to read, but I loved the story and the history that came with it. Interesting and educational.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book because all I've heard about it is that a bunch of people kill each other in a stupid competition for the amusement of the capital. All I have to say is that YOU SHOULD JUST READ THE BOOK!!! It's awesome
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|Very immersive depiction of the tragic tsunami of 12/26/04 based on the true story of one family's experience while spending that Christmas at a resort on holiday in Thailand. Great acting and action with a lot of heart. It's pretty visceral, so be ready to get a gut-wrenching feel for what it may have been like to try and survive in the middle of the chaos. I think they did an outstanding job making it look real and keeping the action and drama going after the initial impact. The dialogue isn't exactly out of The King's Speech, Lincoln, or a Shakespeare play but with something like this you really just needed the key actors (Watts & Holland) to get the emotions across and for the filmmakers to make it look and feel real, which they all did in a powerful way. And while the actual video footage of this tsunami was relatively limited for its scale, compared to all the footage of the more recent and less fatal Japanese tsunami, the filmmakers really got it right and did a good job expanding on it for what little they had to go by.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Any device I have that I would consider worth anything and can go online should have the Amazon app. Its just a more convenient way to shop. I downloaded this to my smartphone, to my tablet and also to my computer. A must have.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this. It works as advertised and I haven't had any problems. I am very pleased with all it has to offer.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I had been anticipating this book for sometime and as usual, Gregory never fails! I recommend this to everyone I speak to books about!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show has a really good story line and is really well made, This is a show i would recommend to any of my friends.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I watched this on my Kindle Fire HD, and it was awesome!  For such a little screen, I was amazed by the quality of the sound and the picture!  The picture was so clear, and the sound was amazing!  I would highly recommend this movie!
B00BVVA138|5.0|I would strongly recommend. I listen to some songs on youtube was very impressed. I bought it right after I listened. Well worth money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that more people should get this app because its fun and isn't a waist of time.I love this APP!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|love it .I watch the show everyday I have all the seasons that are out cant wait for  the next season. thank you amazon
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It's Twitter, but on your phone or kindle or whatever. If you were expecting literally anything else you'll be disappointed, but otherwise you'll probably get what you wanted.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Had a few good laughs and enjoyed it more than a few Tarantino movies.  Jamie Foxx was fantastic and had a story line worth following.
B0064MGU98|5.0|An open eye view of the machinations of the legal profession and the chicanery that follows to elicit PROFIT. Depiction is excellent and convincingly done. Highly recommended for all thusly interested.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|If you like SciFi how else can you rate this.It is SciFi in it best - action and detective and everything else in between
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app but it does force close a lot. and I have to reload the app to open it some times. Please fix in the next update!!!!!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This film is visually stunning but is also a wonderful story about the will to live and knowing one's self. I'd also suggest the book.
B005HSL626|2.0|It's fun for like five minutes and then you realize you're just smearing your kindle screen and cramping your wrist.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like that you can change the horses mane into crazy looks like rainbow and pink. I like that you can change the tail to braids too.<br />- from the mouth of a 6 year old
B00B9366VO|3.0|In my opinion this focused more on how Fleetwood Mac was formed but did have some interesting facts about a few other bands.  It would be good to watch when you  just want to chill & not think much.
1892005034|5.0|Non-violent communication (NVC) or compassionate communication (name I prefer) is one of the best books and techniques which can help us to achieve what we want. It helps us to understand that behind every feeling is your need. If this need is not being fulfilled you might feel various range of negative emotion which however won't bring you closer to your goal. Marshall Rosenberg helps you to understand what is it that you want in order to focus on what you want rather than focusing on the emotions it creates.  We tend to blame others that they didn't do something - e.g. they came late - rather than expressing our desire - that they come on time - and how important it is for us. Regular communication uses: \\"You're driving too fast again!\\" while NVC says: \\"I would feel much more safer if you drove slower. I'm terrified by what might happen if you go this fast and prefer to slow down.\\" Which communication do you think would rather help you achieve permanent slow down? IF you think that it's non-violent communication read this book for many more useful hints how to effectively communicate and achieve your desires.    Further review on: [...]
B000002LFZ|5.0|A lot of times when an album of greatest hits by a singer or group is released the usual complaint is \\"well why was that song not included or how could they not have that song on there\\". In the case of Fleetwood Mac's Greatest Hits that is not the issue here. If ever I think there was a greatest hits album made that included all the hits for that recording artist it is this one. The album includes all of the hits song for Fleetwood Mac from 1975, when Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined the group, up until 1988. Certainly this was the most successful period for Fleetwood Mac during their long career which started way back in 1967. It was during this time with Stevie and Lindsey on board that FM came out with their popular album \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" and their album of the year Grammy winner \\"Rumours\\" among others. It was also the most turbulent times for the group with Stevie and Lindsey breaking up and Christine and John McVie divorcing. But it was those times that also inspired the members of the group to write most of the hits that you will find here on this album.<br /><br />For the huge fans of Fleetwood Mac I don't think you will be disappointed by this album. All the songs we grew up listening too are here along with two new songs, \\"As Long As You Follow\\" by Christine and \\"No Questions Asked\\" by Stevie. If you been looking for a greatest hits album by FM this is the one for you. If you are a casual fan of the group looking for maybe one of their albums to include in your collection again this is the one for you. If you are a fan of the original Peter Green blues style Fleetwood Mac, like me, then this is not the album for you. I must say that while I like the original Fleetwood Mac much better I still like the Stevie and Lindsey version as well. No matter which version of the group Fleetwood Mac has over the years made some of the best music that has ever been heard and hopefully will continue to do some time to come.
B005CMGKTG|4.0|This is a very true to the original reproduction of the 1st season of Star Blazers thru most of the movie.  Great special effects, but heavy on character.  As expected, a movie really can't stand up to a serial -- so much of the epic year long story is lost for the sake of time.  Still it is a good recreation with a great sound track.  The only other disappointment is that no one has bothered to dub it into English (I wonder if the original voice actors are still around?).
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|The movie was not funny.  I kept waiting for the good part,but it never came.  It was just another depiction of our moral decline in this country.
B00BESNKB8|4.0|The storyline was good & so was the acting. Lots of blood & violence but humorously put  in a Tarantino movie.
B00006EXL5|5.0|My Chemical Romance's first album is raw and guttural. Without a doubt my favorite album from the band and I'm glad I finally own a copy.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game! Too bad it does not have more levels/challenges. Nice graphics, sounds are lots of fun too and there's the \\"features\\" that eventually surprise the player (sadly not too often). FUN!
031237593X|5.0|Those who have been riveted by the recent discovery of Richard III's remains might be drawn to a novel like this one that explores his life in a more flattering light than Shakespeare's account. A sweeping, enthralling story with elements of romance, family drama and tragedy, it is hard to put down. It will forever change your view of Richard III.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really love this app, but it crashes way too freakin' much!! If this was fixed, it would definitely be a 5 star!! Please fix this.
B004D20JP2|3.0|This is. Definitely for kids and even at that I thought it was a bit on the dark side, didn't follow the old book that the movie was based on.  I wouldn't recommend it for kids under six.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|This was an excellent historical fiction tale of the Danes invading King Alfred's dream of a united England.  The battle scenes were graphic, violent and everything you should expect of a well-told battle.  Uhtred's humor is easy to relate to, and I found myself laughing at his cynicism and sarcasm.  Cornwell is marvelous at capturing life in the early ninth century, and all the challenges both the Saxons and the Danes faced trying to find their place in a growing world.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't wait to watch the next film.  The film kept me guessing what was going to happen next.  I  can't wait until there is more to watch.  One of the best series I have ever seen.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|It was easy to put my kindle in, decent price and very sturdy.  I like  how you can set it at portrait or landscape and the area you pop it into is very durable.  Great product!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Scirbblenauts Remix is a nice amalgam of the DS Scribblenauts titles.  The on screen keyboard is more responsive than the DS stylus.<br /><br />The game is all about challenging yourself.  You can solve many puzzles using the same few items if you just want to rush through.  You can also have a lot of fun thinking of the most creative solution.  I can see handing the free mode to my kids and letting them come up with random stuff and just having fun with it.<br /><br />There are some levels where your thinking won't really match up with the developers, and you might end up running to the web, but that doesn't take away too much.<br /><br />The major issue I have is the occasional graphical issues and crashes the game experiences.  Granted I am running a nightly version of CM10.1 on my Sprint Galaxy S3, but other games run with zero issues.<br /><br />It's certainly worth your .99 cents, and worth the additional .99 to unlock the remaining half of the levels.  The additional character skins feel a bit like a money grab, but when you consider the pricetag on the original DS version, even buying all of those makes this version a steal.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Movie was OK but was not pleased with storyline. This movie was only about one small part of Lincoln's job.  Hollywood provided misleading promos.
B00BRYDKM8|5.0|I was thinking about writing a book on presentation skills but it looks Like Akash has beaten me too it. I've read a lot of other people's stuff on this topic but gotta say, he's really honed it down to something succinct and readable,<br />and obviously the next step in smart presentation is to work with someone who can coach you in these skills.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Helpful for my marriage, and my parenting. Already putting a lot of ideas into action & seeing positive changes in myself & my family.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|is a fun game. was going good until my kindle lost all data. now starting over. would not waste the time with other games.
B007NU54H4|5.0|Another great tinkerbell movie. I have a 8 and 10 year old and they have watched it none stop since it showed up.
B008XG1X18|5.0|You can get lost pinning. What a lovely way to lose yourself!! Amazing how time flies when your having fun
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Hits so close to home!! So funny. Might actually have to purchase this one. I could watch it again and again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love the game and colors . keeps me entertained for a long time and fun to play with my daughter's help.
B00B7G3NFU|1.0|Very strange movie! I had so many questions and I hated everything about this movie! I did not even finish it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm getting nervous now...only one book left unread in the series.  I guess I'll just have to start reading them all over again.  Love Reacher, and Lee Child.  Was fortunate to meet Lee in NYC recently during a talk at Hunter College.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Of course, Jurassic Park is an amazing movie.  If you liked it when it first came out, you're going to love this.  The 3D effect, in my opinion, was worth the few extra dollars.  It can be a little jarring sometimes, especially during brighter outdoors scenes, but the dinosaurs are really the only thing I cared about, and it worked.  The first time you see the full view of the T-Rex and he roars, that was good times.  Would like to see the other two movies come out in 3D.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|The girl can sing.<br />And this is a great album.<br /><br />This coming from a classic rock fan.<br />I also like Taylor Swift.<br /><br />My wife thinks I'm nuts, but my kids think I'm a cool Dad.
020161622X|5.0|You simply must have this book in your headboard.<br />After reading it for the first time, you are probably going to buy a copy to give to a friend.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I would normally give a movie on a budget like this 3 or 4 stars, but it was true to the \\"Comic Book\\" Dredd, of which I was a childhood fan.<br />This is not the typical 'Hollywood' machination of an old story.<br /><br />Gruesome. I would strongly advise not watching it around the kids.<br /><br />*Note: this review comes with a biased slant, towards those who are actual fans of Judge Dredd.<br />  From the perspective of a typical viewer, I would probably rate this flick 3 or 3.5 stars.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Not quite as good as the same game on my desktop but still easy to play. Good game to pass the time.
1475144687|3.0|The book only has a picture of what you see when u buy it. Rest of book is plain white..looks like a stack of paper in my book collection. Fast shipping though!
B005URRCUY|5.0|Just a great album.<br />These two fellas know how to write a good song.<br />I love the way you can buy a CD on Amazon and get it put in their Cloud for free.<br />Two thumbs up, Amazon!
B001UV4XIS|3.0|The movie used two films to follow loosely, the book. I was disappointed in the film and gave the Dvd to my granddaughter. I wouldn't recommend the product at all. Maybe if I hadn't read the book, I would have liked the movie.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hated for it to end.  There were funny moments, tender moments and breathtaking moments in this very detailed memoir.  Cheryl Strayed is a fascinating person and I loved reading about her journey.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This movie was based on an interesting concept. It was however not the most believable plot. I would recommend it for an adult audience. The concepts may be disurbing to young audiences.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Just like most of the recent Bond movies, this one was a good movie also.  I would watch it again.
B008M7JODC|4.0|I watched the first 7 episodes back to back.  I like it and I am looking forward to more.  It is a Twilight Zone, 5th Dimension, X files, outer limits combo.  It is in a class of it's own as well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use AccuWeather to check the weather ahead of us when we are traveling. It has been so helpful.  Wouldn't travel without it!
B0036TGSR6|3.0|I was very surprised with the story line, I thought it would be better than it was. It didn't keep my interest.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|The Elite was very enjoyable. While it definitely had its pros and cons, it kept me interested and I genuinely cared about  the characters. Was it as good as The Section? No, but this book had many good things to offer as well. I can't wait for the next book!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I had not watched this series when it was on weekly. Now that I am watching it from the first episode, I am hooked!<br />It is like reading a really good book, I cannot wait to see the next chapter.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's a great game, but I'm not getting the updates on my kindle fire. It takes it credits which sucks. And u never have enough for the slots. I'm done buying to play this game.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Just watch it!  Fantastic in all respects.  Acting, location, directing spot on.  More, please do more!  Bring this all the way into the 1990s so that people can see what really happened in England last century.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|great movie action right from the start. not hard to follow. I would recommend this to anyone. Bruce Willis is great in this.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|We are more than please by the quality and the price of these head phones.  We are going to buy s second pair because it has surpassed our expectations!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a great book. I loved all the characters and thought the historical part was probably pretty acurate. Read it!
B008RJFRTK|4.0|I purchased MapsWithMe Pro to be able to use offline while travelling to soccer fields.  WiFi is not always available in rural areas.  I pre-mark park locations to help reduce my travel time.  One weakness is that is does not have a route finding option.  Sometimes it is not easy to tell major/minor, or residential roads apart.  A route planner should be able to use mapping properties to determine the fastest, if not the shortest route.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you think this is awesome,you should play minecraft xbox edition,or PC edition<br /> if your me, it's the best FREAKIN GAME EVER FOR A HAND HELD DEVICE!!!
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|I have used an older version of Photoshop for years and after using Photoshop Touch I am thinking about upgrading my full version of Photoshop to take advantage of the new things Photoshop can now do.<br /><br />I do have trouble with my fat fingers on the touch screen, but I am learning.<br /><br />The only thing I have trouble with is that I cannot figure out how to change the screen orientation. It will not rotate when I turn the screen over.  This keeps the charging port down and charging cable in a bad location when I hold my Kindle Fire in my lap.  :::<br /><br /> fred
B00503C226|3.0|The beginning was a little boring. I guess I enjoy action movies more. Not a bad movie after all.  Will try another drama movie in the near future.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|Bought this for my son's 7th birthday.  He wanted it because of the movable jaw.  he loved it.  Great quality and very sturdy.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Great movie a must see point blank period!!! Nick nolte great performance. Tom hardy is an animal. Joel Edgerton underrated.  Best fight movie in a long time.
B00004W510|5.0|This is one of The Band's strongest albums and showcases their folk-country Americana vision of rock and roll.  Every track on the album is a classic.  The bonus tracks are mostly studio out takes or different mixes of the classic songs.  They're interesting, but not something I would listen to a great deal.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Worth the watch. Not the best Tarantino flick, but it had it moments. I think they could have developed a better ending, but it was ok.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Monsters, Inc. takes a common experience for kids (&#34;monsters in my closet&#34;) and tells us a story of why kids so often say this. We are led into the world of Monsters beyond the closet door. We meet the most lovable, funny and entertaining monsters and hear the back story of the company, Monsters, Inc. Billy Cyrstal and John Goodman are the voices for the main characters and have wonderful chemistry as two best monster friends.<br /><br />I watched this with my kids at ages 6 and 8 and they loved it, as did my husband and I. It's a perfect movie for everyone in the family.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I bought this headset mainly due to the wireless moniker. Looking around at the Corsair Vengeance 2000, it was exact in design and specs, but the price was more expensive ($129.99 as opposed to 116.99) at the time of purchase. I was going to go for the older Logitech F-540s but found the reviews and the lack of any surround sound to be a huge turn off. It's comfortable, made for all head sizes, and cancels out any background noise like a champ. I use this to play online and also for my work. It works really well for software that was more geared towards wired headsets (prior to, I was sporting a Steelseries Siberia v2).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />+  Audio is crisp and clear through the headphones and the mic.<br />+  Very comfortable and surprisingly light on head during normal useage (about 8 hours).<br />+  Very sturdily built frame and comfortable pads.<br />+  Easy set up and use. 7.1 on movies that support it is amazing<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-  Stereo sound isn't greatest quality, but usable nonetheless.<br />-  Wireless adapter not built as sturdy as headset; bended and almost split open completely<br />-  Cost to replace said adapter (~ $30 for an already expensive headset)<br />-  Gaming software doesn't offer up much in the way of truly customizing the headset.<br />Verdict:<br /><br /> I very much enjoy this headset and find that the bonus wireless function is a definite bonus. The G keys don't really provide myself much functionality, but overall definitely a great buy and an awesome product.
B002QRWJA4|1.0|This version sucks. Im going to continue to strictly watch stage productions. Worst phantom make up ever.all in all dont watch of you love the stage versions
B000094HLA|5.0|This is a brilliant interpretation of the Goldberg Variations.  The sound it clean and crisp and the music is sublime.  Glenn Gould's version of The Goldberg Variations will always be the standard on which all future recordings of it are based, but this version is well worth the listen.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|i love to se lots of actions in a movie in keeps me in the movie looking for whats going to happen nexts love it can't wait to see if they would have a I am number 5 and 12346 is in it.loved it
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Purchased this for a hackintosh I built earlier this year.  It's working great and I've had no issues. Would definitely purchase again.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|A true page turner. I just hope, the cliff hanger ending means: Jeffrey Archer is considering a fourth book to the most wonderful trilogy.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|This novel grabs your attention right away and unravels an interesting tale.  The ending is unexpected and the characters believable.
B00000269M|5.0|While Jacko's \\"Tough\\" image seriously did not work, the songs on this album are incredible.  Every track is unmistakably Michael Jackson's R&B, but each track sounds different, thrilling and unique.  This album is more guitar driven than Thriller.  Most of the tracks are written by Michael,  making the songs sound deeper and more personal than on any other album (he only wrote a couple on the earlier albums and on the later he was usually a co-author.)<br /><br />Thriller is probably the better album, it certainly had much bigger hits, but Bad is still amazing.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|i thought it would have more action then it did, but i lkie it.. the kids enjoyed it..next time i a part 2 more action

B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love this program.  The picture is very clear and pleasant to watch..  One of my favorites to watch and catch up on.
B000003TBP|2.0|Sometimes I feel like I suffer from an odd affliction when it comes to music. Probably it's going to sound pompous, or pretentious, and I admit I could be completely deluded and wrong. But my opinion is still my opinion, and no one has to agree with me. My girlfriend likes Radiohead, which I find incomprehensible, so there you go: opinions differ.<br /><br />The affliction I (imagine) I suffer from is having heard too much good music too early. And my other affliction is being belligerently opposed to following lemmings over a cliff without an actual compelling cause (like an actual tsunami at my back).<br /><br />I resisted things like Nirvana and Seinfeld until I could no longer ignore that that stuff was good. (And you don't have to agree with that, either.)<br /><br />But I live in LA, and I know how the hype machine works: a) It preys on the weak-minded and socially addicted, who are desperate to be defined through a clique. b) It preys on the undereducated, who lack proper context and reference (i.e., better art for comparative purposes).<br /><br />To parse that in today's terms: If you only know the works of Jessica Simpson, you may just be blown away by the works of Justin Bieber. Especially if the girls whose lunch table you want to sit at like Justin Bieber too. It's not your fault; everyone doesn't have to know \\"art,\\" because there's more to life than art.<br /><br />Anyway, obviously Beck is no Bieber: he's an artist of some merit. And I wanted to get excited about Odelay.<br /><br />But the amateurish, cut-and-paste noodling, randomized, weightless lyrics and lack of melodic movement could be so many albums from the late-1980s-to-mid-90s; the only thing that makes this stand out is the hyped \\"Beck\\" name, which all cool people are obligated to like. (Much like Radiohead.)<br /><br />How could I compare this to an actual masterpiece, such as Serge Gainsbourg's Histoire de Melody Nelson (which this borrows sounds from), Elvis Costello's Trust or even a contemporaneous work like Ween's Chocolate and Cheese, which is so much more melodically gifted, skilled, varied, and revolutionary?<br /><br />This is a fun, quirky album.<br /><br />But the super-hyped greatness, and its attendant parts (melody, message, craftsmanship): they simply aren't here.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|It's so easy to use. I love it! It makes timing my activities simple & quick. I highly recommend it!
B0081336FO|5.0|Staying with some typical Sherlock plots but using right up to date technology intrigues me.  Both actors are excellent.  I had only caught an episode here and there on regular TV.  It has been great to be able to see what I missed.
1601251556|5.0|This is a really cool product to have if you are into any type of table top game. It's nice because it is reversable and is dry/wet marker friendly. I would say the only real down side is that since it is folded it won't lay flat right out of the packaging but with some wear and tear that stiffness should lessen.
B00A72989U|5.0|One of my favourite albums, ever. And has been for 3 oddsome years. She may make a better song, but not sure she could make a better album.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the story line and all the characters.  It's a life that we Americans are not familiar with and I find it fascinating.<br />I would like to see Season 3 but can't find it on line.  I am HOOKED....
B0009RCPY8|3.0|My son loves the Ghostbusters so I decided to get my own set to have at home. The disc 31 is full of scratches and stops several time during the playing of the movie. i will have to buy another disc 1.
B00785P2QC|5.0|1st of all its its free :) & everything in the game can be earned over time, there is no need to purchase anything. The graphics are great. The app runs super smooth. Creating your own little city is fun & addicting!
B004GXZ69W|2.0|Although it seats hand at different angle, it induces pain in those that have troubles with carpal or repetative action pain.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Very entertaining movie, loved the 3D (doesn't everyone want the 3D effect nowadays). Sometimes I hate how movies with a sequel end, but this one left off in a nice spot to begin the next one. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the Lord of the Rings movies. My 7 year old has watched the old, and I mean OLD animated Hobbit movie and Gulom never bothered her. Maybe since this movie made him more &#34;real&#34;, she was a little scared so she hid under the blanket during those scenes. Other than that, she loved it and has even asked to watch it again since then!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I never saw the beginning season, but I am loving catching up.  This is a great series.  Great story line.
B001IF5YLQ|4.0|If you need multiple monitors on your mac, this adapter seems perfect. I use this and the DisplayPort to VGA adapter and they are awesome for two extra displays on my iMac.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is one of the most exciting series I have watched. I have pre-ordered 2nd season and can't wait to get it. I have read all of the Vince Flynn novels and this is comparable to that work.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I loved this book, very hard to put down.  The writer is very clever the way she feeds you the characters personalities.Just when you think you have grasped who they are, they begin to change.  I have not read anything quite like it before.  I am quite good at guessing outcomes but not with this book.  I have not enjoyed a book this much since I read &#34;before I go to sleep&#34; by s.j watson.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My grandchildren love it!  Animation is super.  A wonderful story.  You can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss.  I would encourage everyone to make sure kids read the book as well.
B001E7EONC|4.0|Well acted movie. The plot keeps unfolding with all the twit and turns culminating in a satisfying climax. Highly recommended.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|this movie was a favorite of mine growing up, i was so happy to find it on here and at such a wonderful price! couldn't be happier
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is 100x better that the program that comes with the Kindle Fire. Now checking my mail is faster and easier.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is. So fun and is mind bogglung ooo and I'm patient about it was going<br /> Ponih the most popular
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really liked it<br />I want to play the second part I think it was challenging to my mind thank you
B009GIPDQS|3.0|Not so much of legal thriller as I was expecting.. No where close to the thrill of the firm or the client.. One good aspect is that its fast paced but suspense became obvious much before the end..
B004UHL9EK|3.0|This app is nice, but isn't a plain timer. However, you can create multiple timers and the timers are pretty customizable. If you want just a timer, skip it, but I think most people who get this app will find it decent enough to keep.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it and I can't wait for the last one! Great love story and very close to Shades of Grey but different all at the same time.
0553801473|4.0|I wish the author would stick to the main characters. It takes so long between books, that now I can't remember where Rickon and Arya are.Did Arya go back to Westeros? And where did Rickon go? I hope the next two books come out soon.
B009EDYZBY|3.0|Not as good as the first movie. Kids seem to like it. I feel that it shows too much disobediannce
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Another of archer classic.. Must read for all his fans and for some one to become his fan..waiting for 3rd part
B0095P3ULC|5.0|The robotics, the action ,the suspense !!! Liked it all! Haven't seen all of the Transformers movies, but if they're as good as this one, I'll be looking forward to watching them all.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I keep using this to buy and send stuff home - better than achy legs at the mall.  and it gets there with no problems
B003QSMC18|5.0|I love the movie and the quality of the online streaming was very good. It was a nice way to watch a movie last minute in the living room.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Coolest game ever. I play it all the time. It is relaxing and fun. I like it because it takes a lot of skill.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Fantastic story telling, bit slow at times but typical archer story, across generations and decades, not in league of Kane and able or the fourth estate but good enough
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I have not been able to load my library to my android phone even though I have the app. I cannot get to my phone so I can read away from home. I found the Nook to be much easier to do that than Kindle. Unfortunatley many of the books I want are only availble on Amazon. Otherwise it works well on my pc and the one book I down loaded to my phone is good also.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Helped me realize what I can do to save and protect batery. Also always gives you battery status. Plus lets you know what you spend most of your time
B0053KWDES|5.0|Saved alot of coin on this investment ... headphones will never sound the same.<br />Even Cheap Headphones benefit from this incredible amp.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|This is a great budget CPU.LGA-1155 socket.My only problem is that it is a dual core processor.....If you are new to the gaming PC (Like myself) don't go cheap like I did....Get the i5-K Series.That has quad core, and is over-clockable.<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars.Me being cheap doesn't merit a 4 star rating.This CPU works perfect right out of the box.Comes with a stock CPU cooler fan.Hooks into MoBo really easy.CPU fan comes with Thermal Paste pre-applied.(Also, outperforms the best CPU paste on the market...Intel must not be cheap like me)<br />5/5
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I absolutely love this book for everyone who loves Halo must read this book. So read this awesome book if you like the game
B005GIS1SY|5.0|This is my one year old boy's favorite movie. He laughs and loves all the colors. The definition and audio is so great.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this CD.  To be fair, if I had not seen the YouTube videos it would have made it harder to enjoy the CD.  So, my advice is watch the videos before you buy the CD.  My one year old son loves hearing the Piano Guys CD and frequently claps to demonstrate his approval.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Great psychological suspense; fast-moving and informative about all things OCD.  I loathe stereotypical characters and formulaic plots, and I'm happy to report that this relied on neither.  Held my attention the whole way through.  Highly recommend.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The third season was the best season for Fringe. The creators seemed more free to tell their story. I love these episodes.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This helped me find every word that I need to find in a matter of one or two minutes tops.
B00947N6D8|5.0|This movie flows well from scene to scene.  Each of the characters is deep and real, having problems each is dealing with just like any of us.  The characters have character flaws which make them more real but they try to put aside their own problems for the benefit of the innocent of the world, the children they protect.  Even though it is sad that one of the guardians dies, I feel elated every time I watch the scene where he is resurrected.  Also, the guardians never give up, no matter what circumstances they find themselves in, particularly when hope seems lost for the guardian, Tooth.  The guardians rally around her and circumstances improve immensely due to their combined efforts to help one whom they deeply care for.  This movie can teach us that no matter how dire our situation or the situation we find our loved ones to be in, if you just believe, show a little faith, and try your hardest, the bad can be defeated in the end.  This is a must-see movie for anyone feeling depressed and hopeless.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Castt is awesome! Christopher Waltz was amazing! Acting was overall great, Would def. recommend it! Intense story but well directed.
B00000IREA|5.0|Okay, I'm a Vietnam-era vet, so I still have some strong feelings about Hanoi Jane's politics. If you can put that aside and watch this movie as it originally was in the theaters, before Jane Fonda became Hanoi Jane, it's great fun. As probably most know, it was based on a French cartoon by the same name, and it has that cartoon flavor throughout. Take it for a little fun, with a little skin thrown in, and you'll really enjoy this DVD.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This is one movie that deserved all its hype.  A fascinating and brilliantly constructed film, with so many layers that I'm still trying to sort it out after four viewings.  The supporting cast is better than DiCaprio (especially Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, who may be the best actor in films today), but Leonardo is surprisingly strong and carries his part well.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|NICE SOUND, NICE CONCERT TRULY. NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY, GEORGE HARRISON IS A GENIOUS!! THE LYRICS, THE SOUND, THE PASSION TO MAKE SUCH A WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL SONGS!!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It was a nice change from all the histories, mysteries and message books - just relaxing, fun reading for the summer.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Good cop show....gritty and no holds barred.  The entire cast is great - can't wait to watch the remaining seasons.
B001NLKT60|5.0|2 down, 1 more book to go, this is a really great series, its hard to put this book down.
B004GF244K|5.0|NICE SOUND, NICE CONCERT TRULY. NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY, GEORGE HARRISON IS A GENIOUS!! THE LYRICS, THE SOUND, THE PASSION TO MAKE SUCH A WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL SONGS!!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I have this on my cell phone, but hard to aim on such a small screen. More fun on Kindle Fire--but should I have got it free, since it was already on the cell phone? Oh, well--great fun for only 99 cents.
0345525558|4.0|I finished this novel yesterday with a smile. By the end one wants to visit Victoria's shop.  I referred often to the flower dictionary at the end of the book.
B00BF123WG|5.0|This story of an everywoman armed with common abilities and an uncommon will and singleness-of-purpose is disturbing, suspenseful and enlightening.  I suspect this is a much truer picture of intelligence work than anything I've seen before. The 95% perspiration/5% inspiration model seems to hold true in this movie and it feels real to me.<br /><br />The might of the CIA seems to have been trumped by the determination of the agent.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|A VERY COOL CONCERT, WOOOW SHE IS A VERY TALENTED WOMAN INDEED. HER VOICE IS SO NICE TO MY EARS!! GREAT GREAT!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have not had to use it, but testing it out, it seems fine.  It is on my Kindle Fire, and I just hope it works away from home.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|This game presented a screen to give a review, do it later, or never. However the choices of later or never just resulted in the same screen reappearing until I selected give a review now. S I give one star for being force to review.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I had never been a Dr. Who aficionado  growing up. I discovered it for the first time recently, and have really enjoyed the humor, imagination, and cleverness of this series. Season One is good, but the show really takes off in subsequent years with David Tennant. If you're just starting, you have a lot to look forward to.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is so addictive. With the recent updates, you can steal a jet pack and kill zombies. Also the free play is extremely impressive for a mobile platform.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Weather is very good to know. Getting information Or as I say a good idea about what the weather is going to do is helpful. This app is right on the money when it comes down to what the weather will do. Get this app and you will see what the weather will do all around the world. If weather stations used this app we wouldn't hear a bunch of bull s***. This app will prove my point and all you have to do is hit purchase, its free and saves you from all the commercials on TV. Commercials and weather channles suck, this does not suck at all. So kick back and relax with this free weather app.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Jeff Goldblum, Brent Spiner, Mary McConell, The Poor Man's Alec Baldwin, and THAT'S just half the line-up. Seriously, this movie is amazing. For a bonus round, spot all the Star Wars homages!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Easy to use and versatile. Use it all the time for cooking, exercising and for timing events at work. Like the ability to save multiple timers with different icons.
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|like the game...just wish we could do the fighting ourselves instead of just standing still the graphics are awesome and its fun but it gets boring
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The book is better than the show, of course. If you've read all the other books, then this is the next book you should get.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is better than some of the other bingo games I have played,  It seem like I win more times on this one than on the others. It is a game I play every day
B0044RUSZM|4.0|keeps me from straining my neck to look down at the laptop, I'm a pretty tall person (6'3&#34;) and it has been a pain in the past. This thing solves that problem though, pretty simple and sleek design.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!  We all love it, and the quality was fantastic, and it had great renting price! Definitely a rent-again!
B007ONQ42O|4.0|The music on this album is great. Halestorm has an amazing sound. I'm hooked. My only issue is the profantity/derogatory language. Wish more music was great music, and could exclude that.
006114665X|5.0|A great book explaining what went on in the Balkins prior to Word War I. A little hard to read in places, but very informative.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Epic story!  Great characters.....characters you love to hate, and characters you just love.  Has a plot that twists and turns, and keeps you interested through all 1000+ pages.
B004CURZFC|4.0|Though it would have been all the more gripping in 3D, it had excellent quality even when watched on our old TV! There were a few system hiccups, but it was still a great watch!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I ordered all 3 seasons.  Never got anything done for watching them until the end.  Can't wait for the 4th season(know there has to be one).  Best I have seen in a long time!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app is a must have!  It makes it easy to track down files and such on your kindle. For instance, I had downloaded a pdf to the kindle and it would not show up under  &#34;docs&#34;.  I got this app and I can easily track down what I want quickly.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|It's a familiar meme: don't wear a red shirt on the deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise; if you do, you're likely to be killed before the first commercial break.<br /><br />This not-so-inside Trekkie joke became the basis for novel of the same name by John Scalzi. Heck, there's even a Redshirt song by Jonathan Coulton (of Code Monkey fame; speaking of which, there's a graphic novel Kickstarter project and a related album of Coulton's). Clearly, Mr. Scalzi is jumping onto a fairly main-stream meme (hey, even I heard about it).<br /><br />So, I hunkered down, ready for some inside Trekkie references and some serious fun. Redshirts does not disappoint on that score. It begins as expected with funny, light banter about junior officer life in space and fodder for various life forms they encounter; away missions and survival tend to be mutually exclusive for the junior officers. Soon, however, it dives a bit deeper - the senior officers go from normal to clich&eacute; in 7.6 seconds and then, flip back. Even Star Fleet officers typically don't do that. You get the picture; to say more, I'll need to leak some of the story. Before I continue on to the spoiler version of the review below, let me say a few things I'll attempt to substantiate below:<br /><br />- Mr. Scalzi does a good job building the relationships and defining the characters in the first half of the book. Those characters grow considerably in the second half of the book.<br /><br />- Speaking of the second part of the book, a relatively surprising shift takes place that moves the dialog onto a bit more speculative and less comical ground.<br /><br />- The three Codas at the end  of the book are a non-trivial; they address some very interesting and often overlooked issues and perspectives. Do not blow by these. My view is that they take a really good book to the next level of excellence.<br /><br />- I believe that you could enjoy the book without being a Star Trek (or even SciFi) fan. Most who read it will be both, but it's not necessary to lock in.<br /><br />- I went between listening to the Audible book, ably read by Will Wheaton of Wesley Crusher fame on Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) and the Kindle edition. Mr. Wheaton is able to convey both the humor, the action and the issues  equally well. (If you don't already, follow him on Twitter @wilw. He's both funny and has some interesting insights; mostly funny. Pet Peave timeout - my dear developer friends at Audible, please get Whispersync for Voice working on Windows Phone 8 so that I can pick up where I left off on my Kindle Paperwhite. It's a fabulous feature. Overall, I love the app, but it could stand that improvement. Thanks. Now, back to our regularly scheduled program.<br /><br />- My one disappointment: while I understand that Mr. Scalzi is reflecting military life (and that this isn't his father's Star Trek), the language was overly foul. All that needed to be accomplished could have been done so with brief forays into foul language land, instead, we move in and occupy it.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />It turns out that our intrepid crew, yes pun intended, of the U.U. Intrepid, were really part of a future show that used Star Trek as its basis; a sort of Star Trek remix. The writers often used cheap dramatic tricks of death, destruction and mayhem to keep their audience interested; the tricks were typically played on the Redshirts. The book goes from mere fun to interesting when the junior officers, led by Ensign Andrew Dahl, figure out that they are part of a show. Now, not only do they know the challenges of going on away missions in red, they are cognitive of the fact that they're bit players in a show. Mr. Scalzi handles this awareness very well, and he takes it head on. He has Dahl and friends meet the show's producers; they come into contact with their doppelg&auml;ngers and attempt to right many wrongs and make the alternate universe safe(r) for democracy. This is adroitly done with no over-long back-story; rather Mr. Scalzi takes you from what you think will be the main, light fun meat of the book and uses it to build the characters and relationships so that, by the time awareness dawns and producers are met, we know the characters, care about them and their relationships and are ready to walk with our new friends in unexpected directions.<br /><br />The characters now become involved with the lives of the \\"real world\\" folks; albeit some involuntarily like Lt. Kerensky and some more intimately like Jasper Hester. I do want you to read it, so I won't say anything more other than, it works. That's saying a lot. A character meeting themselves in the real world when they were a bit part the \\"real\\" person nearly forgot they played is nearly the embodiment of \\"awkward\\". Yet they meet and move on.<br />Some of the most interesting parts comes in the codas - what would you do if, as a script writer, you discovered people actually died, in some alternate world, when you killed your characters off? You couldn't very well continue knocking them off. Now what? You still need tension and story. But wait, what if even angst over this question is covering up a deeper issue. Now, we're talking. Yes, John Scalzi goes there.<br /><br />What if your characters meet and, for the first time, you receive \\"tough love\\" feedback from someone you can trust, your other self. He goes there too.<br /><br />Finally, what if the \\"story\\" dead spouse of an unhinged husband has a counterpart who drifts because she knows there something else, a sense of loss or missing connection?<br /><br />All of these are examined in the context of story, not simply self-reflected dialog.<br /><br />So, while I thought Redshirts would be fun, and it was, it was also thought provoking, had some drama going down and some characters growing up.  Well done Mr. Scalzi.ack-story; rather Mr. Scalzi takes you from what you think will be the main, light fun meat of the book and uses it to build the characters and relationships so that, by the time awareness dawns and producers are met, we know the characters, care about them and their relationships and are ready to walk with our new friends in unexpected directions.<br /><br />The characters now become involved with the lives of the \\"real world\\" folks; albeit some involuntarily like Lt.

B008EKMB82|5.0|This novel caught me up and I read through quickly. Interesting characters and insights into Japanese culture. I don't know how true or realistic the views on culture are but it all works in this story. I am interested to read more of Ozeki's works.
0307279189|1.0|I am a runner and I love to run. I believe that we have overcomplicated our footwear and that less is more. I believe in the meditation of the trail and that barefoot running could be a spiritual experience. But this book is a ridiculous piece of garbage and I cannot believe it made it to the bestseller list.<br />- It exploits the poor and indigenous people of the copper canyon who can barely feed themselves.<br />- It tries to glorify Caballo Blanco, a guy who did absolutely nothing with his life and disassociated himself from society to live in a hut in Mexico so he didn't need to face the pressures of society under the guise of \\"learning the ways of the Tarahumara people but really helping to exploit them.<br />- Actually makes the statement that running solves all modern ailments. \\"Perhaps all our troubles - all the violence, obesity, illness, depression, and greed we can't overcome - began when we stopped living as Running People. Deny your nature, and it will erupt in some other, uglier way.\\"<br />- The Running man theory in which we chased down our prey is utter nonsense. Even Dr. Lieberman claims that McDougall misquoted the information. There are absolutely ZERO studies to support that humans ever, ever ran down their prey.<br />[...]<br />Tell me the story of the race. Tell me the story of the people in true words. But don't sit there and try to make unrealistic and factually incorrect statements. Your entire credibility was lost. I want my money back.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|A friend had told me I needed to read this series. I will admit, when I read the 1st page and found out what the &#34;disease&#34; was(I don't want to give up spoilers), I thought this would be extremely childish or cheesy...I was pleasantly surprised as I kept on reading. I enjoyed this book very much and am currently working my way through the second book. If you love dystopian stories like The Hunger Games, I think you will love this book.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I've watched Downton Abbey and thoroughly have enjoyed the first two seasons of Upstairs Downstairs. I would highly recommend it.
B00BHU261S|3.0|Not a very likable man but her redeems himself at the end. Great acting by the cast and interesting story.
B004DWKO8Y|3.0|I was a fan of Mr Big years ago and even stood out in the cold waiting to get into a venue to see them in the middle of winter. I really, really wanted to like this album. I really hoped it would be worth listening to. Unfortunately, it's not.<br /><br />Eric Martin's vocals are fine, the music is fine, solid (yes, the musicians can play their instruments and the singer can carry a tune) but... there's nothing memorable about any of the songs. It might be fun to listen to live but on an album it's just so-so. There are so many bands out there there that have songs with more memorable lyrics and music. Borrow a copy of What If if you must, or get a cheap copy if you can but full price, even half price just isn't worth it.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|A friend had told me I needed to read this series. I will admit, when I read the 1st page and found out what the &#34;disease&#34; was(I don't want to give up spoilers), I thought this would be extremely childish or cheesy...I was pleasantly surprised as I kept on reading. I enjoyed this book very much and am currently working my way through the second book. If you love dystopian stories like The Hunger Games, you will love this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard people talking about Downton Abbey, saw that the show had received numerous awards but had never watched an episode.  Last month I decided to give it a try.  I was pleased that it was offered on Prime Instant video.  I was hooked instantly, seriously.  Within the first few minutes, I knew I wanted to watch more. All my spare time was used catching up on the three seasons.  I can not wait for the next season to start.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Great psychological thriller. Fast-paced and enthralling, every step of the way, toward a not-so-shocking but still gripping conclusion. Pretty impressive for a first novel. Can't wait to read her second!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's great.  From the first episode you will be addicted to the series. You wonder what will happen next. I look forward to each episode.

B001NN4162|5.0|This movie is a fun movie and a great family movie. Worth watching more than once, makes you go awww!
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Great! Love it. Have I reached the required words yet? I really don't want to do this. I just wanted to give the series 5 stars. Ok.. that should do it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Excellent app for my Kindle Fire.  Convenient and easy to use.  Would prefer to have study references more available through the media, however, it suffices for my needs when I am traveling or out on errands.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this series and this was a great ending to it!  Was very skeptical that I would get into this series at all since I don't tend to like a lot of the &#34;popular&#34; new books.
B00867GK26|5.0|This is movie you can watch over and over and never get tired of it. It is a movie for adults and children, a great family movie. I love watching it.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I bought this for my new QNAP TS-269L after doing some research on what RAM might be compatible.  I read through a lot of forums to see what other people had tried, and I only saw a couple of posts that did a successful upgrade on this NAS model.  I'm happy to report that this RAM does work for me, and the NAS reports 3000.6MB after this 2GB upgrade!  It was definitely worth the $20-something gamble, compared to the outrageous QNAP OEM RAM price.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I've been getting the Dr. Panda games for both my Kindle and iPad. My 3 year old grandson loves them and they keep him occupied on car rides and anywhere else we go where he could easily get bored. And it seems like he's learning stuff while he's having fun.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|Some of the games are Free but not all. The install is easy and uninstall easy. Once installed you will realize that  getting used to no joystick is the factor loss that may or maynot decide to keep or appriciate the games. Overall it is the look of Atari. The price for other games you like is your decision.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The filming of this movie makes it one to watch over and over, as the special effects are great, It is a movie you will want to watch more than once.
0385736002|4.0|This is a fantastic YA series that has something for everyone; since the two main characters are both male and female, the book appeals to both sexes. It is especially appealing for those who have background knowledge in the mythology of various cultures, but would still be enjoyable to those who don't.  Lots of action and good character development.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham uses his knowledge & experience to get it right but  does not fall into the trap of making the information too &#34;legalese&#34;. And he writes a great story that makes you interested in the flawed but totally human characters.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I love this story. It is hard to believe it is all true. Such an amazing look at the authors childhood.
B0013FBS20|5.0|This is a great movie and Will Smith is excellent in it. It is a movie you want to watch again and again.
B00A83075M|4.0|The whole family loved this movie.  My 6 and 4.5 year olds keep talking about it and my 2 year old was at least interested enough to watch and not climb on everyone!  It had a good story and was a perfect movie night movie
B007EECSFA|5.0|I could not put this book down!! It has twists I never expected. It definitely kept its secrets 'til the very end!!  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and would recommend it.
B00BJS7104|5.0|If your a fan of Quintan you will love this movie lots of action not boring lots of blood and guts better than a spaghetti western
B002ZG981E|5.0|This is an excellent movie, it is one you have to watch more than once. Just to make sure you didn't miss anything the first time. And DiCaprio was great!
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|This seems to be a relatively painless way to loose weight.  The book really makes sense to me, skipping a day of eating is much easier and cost effective than any other diet I've tried.  It has the added benefit of giving you organs a chance to rest.  Read the book and decide for yourself.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I started out with the original and this one really blew me away.  I've had it for a couple months now and still can't make it all the way through without having to try again... I accept your daunting challenge, Epic.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I am going to recommend this book to my sales manager to help our sales people learn how to better cold call and pre qualify sales. They need to learn how to instigate more conversations...not just let people come to them.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Great family movie. The best action since the Rocky series from the 80's. I will buy it for my grandsons.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|The movie was really good, and Jamie Foxx did a great job projecting smoldering anger and growing as a character during the movie.  I wasn't as impressed with his love interest as she seemed like she just wanted to hide in the corner all the time.  Leonardo did a great job and you really hated him by the end.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This is one of those movies that is slightly off-kilter, but highly entertaining.  The movie is downright funny, and every actor delivers without being over-the-top.  Bill Murray, Ed Norton, Bruce Willis and Francis McDormand are excellent, but the kids own the movie.  This is one you will be glad you bought.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|There are few to heroes in the world and we are extremely fortunate that we have our Armed Forces who step up to the plate every day putting everything on the line on behalf of our citizenry. This book was recommended to me by a friend and it was well worth the time and expense reading it and I would urge every American to read and/or familiarize themselves with this story.<br /><br />In any armed conflict there is terrible loss and indescribable pain and suffering. This story has all that can be felt along with feats of heroism that only true patriots will appreciate in their souls.<br /><br />I will never forget what happened on Murphy's Ridge and the downing of the rescue helicopter full of Seals and other Special Forces professionals. The loss of these extraordinary men is a loss to every American.<br /><br />Most Americans have no comprehension of what it takes to be a member of our Armed Forces or for that matter in the Special Forces. WE ENJOY OUR FREEDOM BECAUSE THESE HEROES DEFEND US WITHOUT EVER CONSIDERING THE DANGERS THEY MUST FACE ON OUR BEHALF! We will never be able to fully thank them for their willingness to serve our country. Read this book to help understand what these men, the service and their families at home lost forever fighting against insurmountable conditions in the Hindu Cush.
B004HX4RT6|2.0|game makes plays that show no logic - such as sacrificing queen for a pawn. also, will only play with kindle in upright position, requiring me to hold it instead of using cover as a stand sideways.  does not rotate to fit kindle attitude
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Heard from everyone that this was a &#34;must see&#34; series.  Late getting to the party, but I started with Season 1, just finished Season 2.. Had to know the background of these fascinating characters.  Excited to begin Season 3.
B0034G4P26|4.0|This was a very entertaining family movie.  If you are a fan of &#34;Wallace and Gromit&#34; or you liked &#34;Chicken Run&#34; then this is definitely one you will want.  If you never heard of any of those, then you need to broaden your horizons.  In this day of CGI, it's refreshing to see clay-mation still packs a punch.  There are also some surprising actors doing the voices for this.  It is well worth the great price Amazon is asking.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much because I am crazy for horses. My horse is very realistic which I why I like it I am addicted!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have been a fan for a few years no.  Great for fisherman and golfers!  If you are in a location with constant climate changes, this is the app to have!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game was like a million times better than the btd 4. And all the updates it gets it just keeps getting better and better!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is one outstanding movie.  It is like &#34;Apollo 13&#34; in that even though you know how it will end it still holds you in suspense.  Allan Arkin and John Goodman are fantastic, and I have to give props to Ben Affleck.  This is a &#34;must-own&#34; movie.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|This movie is great.  My kids really enjoyed it.  We didn't have any problems with the DVD, but the UltraViolet Digital Copy was disappointing.  The code that was inside didn't work.  I tried it several times and it wouldn't accept the code.  It was really disappointing.  I wouldn't bother getting this if you are looking for a digital copy.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|What's up with the directors use of film speed? The movie itself was ok, but the blurry picture was annoying.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I am really getting a good workout with this app. The only problem I had was....the leg part will not open for me:(. So I had to buy the leg and butt app separate and complete the 10 min routine 3 times.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wow this was a great book.  I really enjoyed reading this story. I can't wait to see the movie.  Great stuff.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it; you can't imagine how much fun you can have . You sure can make the other person who is driving want to know what you are ooohing and aaaahing about!!!!!!!!!!
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|This was an excellent movie based on the neovel. It almost adhered to the book exactly. There were no major changes made.
B0035OC7OU|5.0|Now my favourite of the Discworld series. Death, his home and the chars in it inventive and very amusing.  Great read.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Have watched for five years and think the final season was done right.<br />This is a humorous take on Merlin and King Arthur.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Quality, Substantive, educational - I know there will need to be an end but I don't have to think about that yet - do I?! I enjoyed it on our big screen TV, my lap top and my IPad.  It didn't matter. I was thrilled to learn about Amazon Instant Video where I could watch Season 2.  Eagerly awaiting Season 3.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|This is a great series for both adults and older children. I enjoyed the storyline and the acting was excellent.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Addicted!!! One of my favorite games.Can't get enough of this game. Lol. I play this game all the time. The graphics are great and I love the challenge.
0486278077|5.0|Another standard by which to judge other authors.<br /><br />At the age of 43, I've finally gotten to Wilde (aside from his delightful children's tales) after many years of the \\"I'll get to him, I'll get to him, stop bothering me\\" stage. I wish you all hadn't stopped bothering me. Reading this at 23 might have helped me to understand some dark events and people better.<br /><br />Not a novel to make one feel good, for sure. As a matter of fact, it left me feeling nauseous at a few points. Wilde is such a master of prose that he's able to describe perfectly the vacuous \\"new\\" hedonism he observed in late Victorian society with his characteristic wit yet show no signs of cynicism that might otherwise lead the reader to any dry conclusions. Rather than being an autopsy of the condition of morals, it is simply a body laid bare upon the table, complete with hair and scabs and scars and imperfections, leaving you mildly uncomfortable at the slight grin on its pale face.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I started watching this series just a few weeks ago on the recommendation of a friend.  I am already hooked.  I like the premise; the modern setting works splendidly.  Both lead actors are great, and I especially like this take on Watson's role as an active partner.  The action is fast - my husband describes it as &#34;relentless&#34; - and the plots are clever and well worked.  Highly recommended
1439127727|5.0|An exclusive club - never larger than 6 (and will shortly be six again unless someone dies in the meantime.) The most influential club in the world and it acts mostly behind the scenes. That is the thumbnail description of this book.<br />I normally do not like reading about politics or current political history. When I saw this book, I decided to sample it (my Nook offers that option) before I bought it. I was hooked half way through the introduction.<br />It is politically balanced, extremely well researched and just fascinating. The details highlight the story rather than overwhelm them. The authors manage to sweep away the myths of presidential encounters (for example: Truman's use of Hoover to save Europe from starvation) and find the real truth behind the myth (Hoover's invitation took many hesitant steps to achieve.)<br />The authors managed to describe all sides of any issues (who wanted a change and who did not). Ever more interesting to me is some insights as to how the Presidents use each other though they may be on far different political sides. When Obama needs him, Clinton comes to play golf with \\"his president\\" but they rarely talk politics. Now that is insightful information. The book is full of this type of insightful, sometimes humorous, sometimes riveting information.<br />No matter how you feel about our current president, of a past President this is a valuable tool to understand how they are changed by the power and the office itself. It explains how idealistic new presidents come away with different views and more centralized agendas.<br />For anymore who wants to understand political power and particularly the challenges of modern day presidents this is a must read.
0061474355|5.0|Sabriel by Garth Nix<br /><br />In a world where the new mechanical age is physically separated from the old, traditional age by a literal wall, chaos is breaking out and threatens to destroy both kingdoms, as well as all of the inhabitants. In a place where the dead walk and dark magic is taking over, the residents of the Old Kingdom are held hostage by the dead and their powers, while the strongest inhabitants of the Old Kingdom are imprisoned under curses or dead. The fate of both kingdoms is left to a teenage girl who has the power to banish the dead, and rescue the living.<br /><br />Sabriel must leave boarding school to find her father, the Abhorsen, so he can confront the evil brewing within the two kingdoms. The kingdom of Ancelstierre is the technological equivalent of England in the early 20th century, while the Old Kingdom is the equivalent of the Medieval Ages in Europe, complete with magic and superstitions. The residents of Ancelstierre believe that the reports of strange magic are merely superstition, while the residents of the Old Kingdom know better. Within the Old Kingdom, the residents know that something is out of order and the two kingdoms are on the brink of chaos and destruction, as evidenced by the constant rising dead and the evidence of ancient magic.<br /><br />Sabriel has no choice but to use her inherited powers of banishing the dead to send the dead spirits back to their graves and to rescue her father. We quickly learn that Sabriel can cross into the void that is death and communicate with the dead, but she must also avoid the dead spirits here for fear that they may beat her in battle within her own conscious, and take over her body for their own evil schemes.<br /><br />Quickly after entering the Old Kingdom, Sabriel realizes that a powerful dead creature is stalking her, and she must beat him to her father's house. Here, she rests and stocks up on supplies, while also meeting a dead creature bound by her father in the body of a cat: Mogget. Mogget agrees to help her on her quest, and advises her as to where her father might be, while guiding her through the ropes of her job as the temporary Abhorsen. Along the way, Sabriel begins to accomplish skills that only an Abhorsen could, and even picks up a love interest, named Touchstone. Ultimately, Sabriel must choose between her own death to save the kingdom, and the probable end of the world to save herself.<br /><br />Honestly, I've read this book before. Well, several times. Okay, hundreds of times. My copy is a ragged shell of its former New York Times' Bestseller covered-self, but the story seems to change with each read. Every time I've read this, depending on my mood or where I am in life, the story reads differently and holds a different meaning for me.<br /><br />I have to explain my personal history with the book to explain why it affects me like it does. For the past ten years or so, every year I request a list of books for my birthday from my dad. My mom's always seen my obsession with reading as frivolous or pointless, but my dad always understood my need to read and live in the shoes of someone else for a few hours.<br /><br />I received this book for my thirteenth birthday, and placed it on my bookshelf. There it sat for most of the summer, and when my mom decided to host a garage sale, I quickly threw the book into the twenty-five cent pile. The book sat anxiously on a table in the corner of the garage, and before long, I snapped it up and took it back inside before it could be purchased.<br /><br />I have serious separation anxiety when I try to give away something that my dad has given me. Especially with this book, my father always knows what to get me that will speak to me in a way that nothing else will. Grudgingly, I began to read this book, but, as usual, he knows me better than I know myself, so I quickly purchased Nix's following novels in the series, Lirael, Abhorsen, and Across the Wall.<br /><br />As I stated, the book speaks to you in different ways depending on where you stand in life. I remember when I moved to the south to go to school and was alone for the first time in my life. Sabriel addressed the same fears and questions that I had, but without the zombie creatures trying to steal my soul.<br /><br />When I realized I was going to graduate and I was going to be thrust into the world without any preparation other than school for the \\"real world,\\" this book reminded me that regardless of where you live or what you do, sometimes you are thrust into something because it's what you're supposed to do, not what you want to do. Even several members of my family unexpectedly passed away in the same time span, the book reminded me that life and death are intertwined, not avoidable.<br /><br />The point I want to make in my rant is not that Nix is incapable of writing a clean novel with an easily distinguishable message, but that Nix mastered a universally applicable book that speaks a true message about life, even the bad parts of life. Most importantly to me, this book inspired me to try my own hand at writing because I would give anything to make a reader feel the way I have felt while reading this book: entranced, vulnerable, awed, and inspired.<br /><br />Simply put: the book moves through essential periods in one character's life so that is it applicable and relatable for every person who could potentially read it. Additionally, the writing style is clean, intelligent, and the ideas behind this story are something of a twist between The Hobbit and The Walking Dead. Clearly, it does not follow the ideas of traditional fantasy or zombies, but the creativity behind this project is truly astounding.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for fantasy lovers, horror and zombie lovers, fans of Garth Nix's other books, and for fans of life stories.peaks to you in different ways depending on where you stand in life.

B009NG1Q96|5.0|Holy crap!! This book was EPIC AND AMAZING!!!<br /><br />Can we give a book 50 stars??<br /><br />Kiera Cass, your writing is amazing, this story is heart gripping and probably the best I will read all year!! Way to go!! :)<br /><br />First of all, let me start off by saying going into this book, I was on a mission. For some reason I wanted to try and read it it very slowly, to enjoy America and Maxon for as long as possible, because I knew the 3rd book will not be released until 2014. I wanted to enjoy it all, after reading The Selection, I just had this feeling that I was going to get sucked in, and I wouldn't want to put it down and that is exactly what happened. I was without a doubt glued to the pages and just dying to make it last.. It took about 12 hours to read.. So much for that plan lol<br /><br />America is amazing. She in my opinion is strong, she is kind, she has a heart that I think would make her the perfect Queen, and she loves Maxon, just as much as he loves her. But she is guarded and she is very careful with her emotions, because there is always Aspen. In my opinion, Aspen is no competition, he is her past, but she doesn't know how to let him go. I think it is clear in the book that she loves Maxon, but the idea of being a princess is scary, not to mention the things she is finding out about the other girls along the way is just too much for her.<br /><br />I wanted Maxon to let everyone go, I wanted him to let the world know that he loves America, and of course that didn't happen. I was so hopeful that this book would be an open and shut HEA and the 3rd book would follow them as a couple, we aren't getting that, and no I am not spoiling, there are SOOOOO many things that happen in this story that I would even tell you about, but just know that I was really almost annoyed that it was going to be dragged out for another book.. My annoyance is really that I love American and Maxon so much and I just want the other girls gone. America's closest competition is someone I never would have imagined, and I don't like it, not one little bit lol<br /><br />needless to say, I am totally in the best way possible bitter leaving this book. I am not satisfied lol and I really hope that something amazing happens and book 3 is released a little earlier, because I don't know how on earth I am going to make it another year without answer, and I really REALLY hope that those answers lead to America becoming Maxon's princess!!
B000UZNRS2|2.0|My first book I've read by Baldacci. I was disappointed although i did finish it .the book drug on and make you lose interes after awhile and just want it to end, which is a let down..
B009FZHYKU|3.0|It is not my favorite season. I find myself wondering how long until an episode is over instead of with the first two seasons I was hoping it wasn't going to end so quickly.
B007R41E8O|3.0|I started out liking this game but as with another game I purchased am stumped. I played along with going from scene to scene and back enjoying. Now I am at scene, the angel on top of a stone and the hint button keeps pointing to the bottom of the stone that has been revealed. It seems no matter what I try to do I can not once again get past this scene to continue the game. Even with the problem I would reccommend the game. i would like to see some help with this before I delete the game and waste my money even though the amount was not much. I really enjoy this type of game.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I have looking to acquire a copy with 3D, but it was cost prohibitive. This is exactly what I was looking for at a very reasonable price.
B008HK3XKO|2.0|I thought you could use it with Kindle either standing up or on side. Lack of information. I ende up buying a wire stand for 5 bucks and use it all the time.the case is good and use it for travel.
B000002NAK|5.0|Evita by Andrew Loyn Webber is indeed a modern Opera that should be timeless.  Some of the music is similar to J.C. Superstar, which is fine.  The songs of Eva Peron of Argentina are some of Madonna's finest.  Very enjoyable serious music.  Dr. John N.
B00B7H3OFI|5.0|Best album to come out in years. If you're a musician you should buy it and if you're not but want to hear something that'll get your pulse up, give it a try. . Get the funk on.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Pink Floyd is timeless. I would recommend that everyone listen to it all. The Final Cut is a great album for the times we are living in now. The best thing about Pink Floyd is that it is real and it makes you think, at least for those who still have the ability to do that.
0451167716|5.0|A great story. The movie did a good job following the book, but as always the book is better. One of the must reads in your lifetime
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Easy to use and fairly quick. Scan to SD card and transfer to computer works best. Color not as true as original slide but OK.
B0085W6II8|5.0|If you're a later Rabin-era yes fan then you'll love this. Squire is phenomenal and Hackett proves to be a smashing guitarist. My only gripe is the vocals are a little over the top in terms of a multitude of tracks. Overall the thing sounds beautiful.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|This movie kind of left me wondering what we are trying to do here? Although I personally have known a few people in my days that were absolutely worthless until they get lit. In some situations you do need that crazy, drunk, doped up, freak to do what only someone wasted would try. Combine that with real world experience and you have a pilot? I don't know, seems like everyone is a little fuddered  up on something. I love movies that make you think and this one is a good one for that.
038572179X|5.0|What can I say? One of the greatest love stories every told. So true to life  A very easy read, read it in 2 days.
0152023984|5.0|Everyone should have the opportunity to read (or re-read) &#34;The Little Prince.&#34;  I bought it as a gift, but read it before I wrapped it and, of course, cried at the ending, one more time.  A lovely book that should be in everyone's home.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I had no expectations going into this and was pleasantly surprised.  I enjoyed the layout of the book and found the story engrossing.  Being a fan of fantasy, I very much enjoyed the references to magic.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The acting + the story + the setting = wonderful.  A very rich movie.  If you want a getaway, get The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
0061122416|4.0|It was a good story with some interesting characters and a good message. I would say that it is a good read, but not a must read.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|Thank you for making this available.  Jane Austin is my favorite writer and I never tire of her books...thank you
B0000A98ZP|5.0|Loved the movie. It was a great oldie to add to our DVD collection. Movie of teens growing up  5 kids who lived difference lives and end up friends
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Haven't had much time to spend playing with this, but I find the stars fascinating.  I will enjoy it and learning to track the stars.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 Golden is definitely the best game for the PS Vita right now. It has the best story for any video game. With nice anime cutscenes. And awesome and addicting gameplay. Do get this!
B0011EP0S6|4.0|It is great movie...songs and singers fantastic...love story with a twist and not much talking compared to other movies but still characters sing and talk plus joke in Irish or European accent in English (sounds so great).  I love it all.  I even bought the soundtrack to the movie and loved  it on Broadway too (it won the best musical Tony). And just saw lead actor in Once Broadway (TONY BEST ACTOR IN MUSICAL) Steve Kazee when he song original song as singer, songwriter, guitar player and excellent funny talker in show at Studio 54 Below in Manhattan.
0143034901|5.0|Reading SHADOW OF THE WIND was like the peeling of an onion with new things disclosed all the time.  After sorting through the story I think the author spoke of how loved children and other children grow up and face life in very different ways.  Loved children are far more resilient to what life throws there way.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I had this on my smartphone and have relied on this to keep me organized and keep track of my to do list, grocery list, Dr. info and have a permanent list of my current meds to whip out to show the Dr. and/or pharmacist.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Works great! Was having problems with my battery going dead because my apps were still running. After installing advanced task killer no longer have that problem! Very simple to use with one press of a button!
B00004RJ71|5.0|Great movie goes to show we've come a long way from those days. It's an instant classic! A must own!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Tarentino does it again. Well made and totally over the top.  Not sure if it was his best film ever, but definitely one of 'em.  Christoph Waltz def deserved that Oscar
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|The Good: When the book starts going into the solutions it gets really interesting and fascinating, Using storytelling to show the problems of traditional IT deployment and development and then how method from manufacturing can overcome the problems one at a time.<br /><br />The Bad: Too many frustrating chapters in the beginning where the problems are piled on top of each other. The empathy the reader gets with the main character is excruciating and I was longing on to get to the solution part.<br /><br />Character building is weak, but then again the main purpose of the book is to introduce smarter methods into running of a company.
B000002KYK|5.0|I have both versions of the soundtrack of the cd, the New American Orchestra and the Vangelis score. I love both. But I am most definitely more in love with this one. Songs from this version, like Memories of Green and Blade Runner Blues, evoke in me feelings of melancholy and bittersweet longing that are tied into memories of the film, which are much more powerful than the Vangelis version.<br /><br />Unless you're a music snob, don't listen to the other snobs who deride this album if you desire a beautifully crafted work that can take you places emotionally. And while I enjoy this version more, the Vangelis score IS an excellent piece of work as well, so check that out also.
1451695195|2.0|I was very dissappointed.  Didn't say anything I haven&#34;t read dozens of times before and wasn't convinced<br />it wasn't a  dream.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|It was so well done I couldn't watch all of it.  Very graphic and to the point.  Again.... just too good.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Awesome game ever!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!<br /> Wow I'm so happy of this game I love love love it so cool and awsome I love it
B000TERKJQ|5.0|I simply love Rachelle Ferrell! I purchased the cd 2 times before and listened to it so much that it started skipping. Soooo, I decided to buy it again because I love her and her music :)
B003O86FMW|4.0|I did enjoy this book.  I was not crazy about the ending, because you really did have to read the next book.  It was interesting and kept my interest without being too difficult to follow.
B000SW2F6M|5.0|The reviews on this film were not that great when it came out.  However, I enjoyed it very much..... acting... era..... everything.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a complete joy to be able to watch a television show with my kids. Total G rated. I hope it never ends!!
B008SAZHLQ|1.0|I am confused as to how this is a YA because the language in the first paragraph would make it rated R if made into a movie.  I tried to get past that but the plot took too long.  It was slow and boring and I didnt even make it half way.  Sorry I wasted my money.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great book to continue with the story of Lena and Ethan. Loved how the characters grew and transformed. I finished this book in less than a week, which is fairly quick for someone with my work schedule. I just found myself unable to stop reading
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|How can you go wrong with a series starring Kevin Bacon!<br />The writing and acting are well done..............Agent Hardy vs. Joe Carroll.<br /><br />James Purefoy (honestly he looked familiar but I was not aware of him) plays the character of Joe Carroll perfectly. A seemingly brilliant professor who just happens to be a serial killer with a cult following.<br /><br />Glad they picked it up for another season!
B008XG1X18|5.0|addicting....like my very own file cabinet to keep recipes and ideas for home.  Completely recommend to everyone who wants to stay organized without paper
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Classic flic, he did it his way Cool Hand Luke! Coolness and class act guy that lives his life his way but doesn't  take anyone down in the process. It's okay to run your life on your own terms  but do it without taking out the life around you. Own your actions like Luke did!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Anyone who like's a good &#34;card&#34; game, that can be played by one player, it allow's the player the ability to try to beat &#34;oneself&#34; and can become a challange .... that's why I like solitaire ....
B000T46O52|5.0|I had to watch this movie for school and am so glad I did! Stellar performances by both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington in addition to a compelling story. Highly recommend this movie.
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|I cannot believe how bad this album is!! He is the worst producer on earth and writes terrible lyrics!<br /><br />I just wasted an hour listening to this album! Thank God I did not buy it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|For those who can't take a leap of faith without scientific evidence, Dr. Alexander offers a scientific perspective.  His background in treating injuries to the brain give his words credence.
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|This entire album is a joke and a musical accident. Sure, there are some nice pop tunes (Scream and Shout, This Is Love) but they don't help the fact that he makes generic music and writes horrible lyrics.
B00BDAP66E|3.0|I like Facebook Page Manager.  What I do not like about it is the limited use on my Kindle FireHD.  Great quick access to my page and I like that.
B00AO686MY|5.0|this movie is nothing short of fantastic...good for all ages - brings back many memories of my favorite cartoon caracters
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|He is always the best but this one isn't as timeless as others. Can't beat the Kindle  lending library price
B002X3V4P2|5.0|What a beautiful voice! She has a voice like an angel. She could sing, &#34;twinkle, twinkle, little star&#34; and make it sound beautiful! I like all the songs and they are very relaxing. The song, &#34;May it be&#34; is my favorite. I am planning on buying more of her music!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Made a lot of sense.  I had never given much thought to how different people show their affection.  Your love language may be quite different from that of your mates.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The program works but is a bit of trouble to make use of for taking pictures. Partly due to the way the Fire is set up.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Action and suspense kept me on the edge of my seat. Even tough you know how the story is goin to end the movie is still interesting and exciting.
B008R14YBK|5.0|I got this cause my 9 year old daughter likes her from Disney Channel. The songs are good and different from most Disney stars cd's. She doesn't have that auto tuned computerized sound like some. She can sing very well. The best part is she will be in concert at our fair this summer and we got tickets front row center. It's my daughter's first concert and I'm glad it's her cause she seems like a good role model unlike other stars her age.I recommend this cd for tweens and grown ups if you like her type of music. UPDATE AUG.2013 She was really great in concert! She sang and did not lip sync. Some artists are not that great live but not her.She was really sweet and my daughter said she would like to see her again! Love her even more:)
B003XUKVXK|5.0|Man, this is some great music. The guitar playing is outstanding. You will truely enjoy it. Worth every penny. buy it
B009O07NMA|4.0|My wife loves the album but I think its just OK.  I like a coupe songs on it but several leave a bit to be desired.
B00C4SUEJI|4.0|The songwriting continues to be the typical Iron and Wine fare (rivers, trees, naked boys) that has made the band a notable name in modern folk. They have expanded instrumentation/orchestration in this album, creating a more upbeat and musically interesting sound. It had a hippy soul vibe with electric guitars, brass, and \\"oooooooh\\" background vocals. This album continues to move away from early, acoustic based, albums. To my ears it is a step forward from Kiss Each Other Clean, which had more of an electronic sound.<br /><br />If you like Iron and Wine and aren't averse to changing instrumentation, buy this album. Check out Grass Windows and Winter Prayer. Won't be disappointed.
0857897764|5.0|I loved this book and will reread it again in a few months!!!  It is well written, entertaining and soul searching for both the author and the reader!!!!
0307352153|5.0|[[ASIN:0814414052 The Other Kind of Smart: Simple Ways to Boost Your Emotional Intelligence for Greater Personal Effectiveness and Success]]<br /><br />Thoroughly researched, intricately interwoven with facts, anecdotes, personal observations and insights,  this is one of those powerful works that has the ability to transform lives. As an introvert I see this book as a very important body of  work that will be quoted and used as a reference for years to come in giving thinkers their rightful due in the world. This book adds credibility and pride to a group of people who have contributed so much to society,  but because of their unassuming nature, have often been overlooked and undervalued. Bravo Susan Cain!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed this game a lot.  I liked the story and the game play was great.  The reason I gave it 4 stars was that the game seemed to end too quickly.  I felt there should have been much more story and definitely more hidden objects.  Overall, however, it's a good game.  Just wish there had been more bang for my 3 bucks.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I like the underlying thread of Peter's appeal that ties all episodes. Also, no car chases and very few gory pictures.<br />at episode 16, though, it is starting to be too repetitive.<br />I am wondering if this is the way lawyers and judges act in real life.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Typical Jack Reacher...page turner!  I like the character and his pursuits are always to help the good guy.  Good read.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|It's hard to think of a band that's been around for more than 30 years, who still makes compelling music, but Depeche Mode is one of. if not the only band who has done that. Delta Machine is a fantastic album from start to finish, and I would be happy if they played the whole album in it's entirety on tour.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|There are numerous stopwatch/timer apps available.  Having tried more than a couple, I found Timers4Me & Stopwatch Pro head and shoulders above the rest.  Like the others it is accurate, intuitive, and easy to use.  The features which distinguish it are the ability to customize the timer functions and the capacity to run several timers simultaneously.  I like it so well I’ve added it to my home bar.
B00C4QWDYY|5.0|Just a simply amazing show...Can't really describe it, somehow they manage to fit in action, suspense, horror, drama, and romance all into one simply amazing show. Go watch it NOW
B002KGEORM|5.0|Great purchase that brought me another great season of Sons of Anarchy! Absolutely loved this purchase and the series! Awesome!
B005V2S7FW|4.0|Last  is free for your computer and only costs $12/yr for your cell phone. It would be worth using just for its ability to find all the passwords stored on your computer and then encrypting them for you. You will be amazed at how many passwords it finds. Some will be left over from departed computers that have long since entered the graveyard. If Lastpass can find them so can someone with malicious intent - so encrypt them pronto. Lastpass stores your information in the cloud and on your computer - if you can figure out where and how to get at it. Read their tutorial to learn how. All these passwords are encrypted and can only be accessed by using your master password, so choose wisely. Lastpass cannot get at your passwords.<br /><br />It stores all your IDS and passwords and enters them when you reach a site that requires them. At least that's how its supposed to work. The problem is that not all sites allow automatic password entry. Then you have to enter your Lastpass vault and find the password and enter it manually. There's a feature (Secure Notes) where you can store IDs and Passwords that you know will require manual entry. A very annoying feature of the program is that it stores multiple versions of your passwords. Thus, if you regularly change a Password you may find 20 versions of it in your vault. Then, if you actually need to find and view the current active password you will have to work your way through a long list of old passwords. You can delete these old ones. Lastpass should fix this problem. Lastpass will also generate passwords for you.<br /><br />In short, a very good program that I use regularly. It can be used on any computer or mobile device. For added security when you use a shared computer you can run it from a thumb drive. It works fine on a mobile phone, but on my Android it's a little klutzy. I can't use apps that need a password entered; it won't enter them. I have to enter the site through through the Lastpass app. Highly recommended,though it could be made even better.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|We loved this ... my 13yod particularly enjoys watching (and re-watching ... and re-watching).<br /><br />Well worth the couple of dollars to &#34;buy&#34;!
B003719GGS|4.0|It had some taught provoking points, the stories were quite plausable. however it seeme to be more success based stories with little or no failures. The multiple choice questions kind of locked you in a corner as to many answer option did not fit the question.
1936719118|3.0|I was first introduced to Derek Sivers while watching a TED Talk. I thought his three minute speech was brilliant, so when I saw that he had written a book I was very excited to read it.<br /><br />Sivers is the creator of CD Baby, a very successful online business that helps independent musicians sell their music. The book is essentially his retelling of the birth and journey of growing that business. It is described as \\"40 Lessons For A New Kind of Entrepreneur\\". The book is put out by The Domino Project and is very short in length (77 pages).<br /><br />Everything in me wanted to love this book, but I just couldn't really get into it. There was some content that I just thought was poor advice (ie. not setting up thorough precautions for possible lawsuits) and then the parts I enjoyed I feel like I have read elsewhere and it wasn't new to me.<br /><br />Even though I wouldn't consider this a \\"must have\\" book, I do think it is a decent book, and it is interesting if you're into the nuts and bolts of starting a project or business.<br /><br />Here are a few quotes from the book that I appreciated:<br /><br />\\"Watch out when anyone (including you) says he wants to do something big, but can't until he raises money. It usually means the person is more in love with the idea of becoming big big big than with actually doing something useful. For an idea to get big big big, it has to be useful. And being useful doesn't need funding. If you want to be useful, you can always start now.\\"<br /><br />\\"You can't pretend there's only one way to do it. Your first idea is just one of many options. No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans.\\"<br /><br />\\"Never forget why you're really doing what you're doing.\\"<br /><br />\\"Delegate, but don't abdicate.\\"
B002QUWYWE|5.0|This movie is such a great thriller.  Kathy Bates is a talented actress and is great in this role!<br />This is a movie that you should have in your collection.
B0049VZ222|5.0|My son kept telling me to watch this series.  I kept putting it off because I'm really not into zombies.  Great!
B00B22IJXK|1.0|Did not like it was expecting more. Waste of my time. I gave 1 star wasnt impressed maybe if you had stuff other appd dont or cant do.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A uniguely different tale, with excellent characterization encorporated into a quick temp plot, Potentially a new scandinavian novel genre. Highly entertaining
B004SUSZB4|4.0|PS, I Love You is a delightful read that I would recommend to all of my friends!  I love the charming Irish setting, the characters, the main character's slow journey through grief toward hope, and the presence of her late husband through his notes to Holly and his friends' memories of him.<br /><br />While it's a long book, it's a very quick read with a fast-moving plot that's humorous at times and poignant at other times.  I know it's cheesy to say this, but the book ends on such a hopeful note- it really is inspiring!!<br /><br />Bottom line: sweet, entertaining, light.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I rated this film 4 stars because I appreciated the research that must have been done<br />for information about inside of the White House during that time frame, and the actors portrayal of the actual people .  The feeling that the President conveyed was unequivocably outstanding.  His moments of anger, fun loving stories<br />he liked to tell, frustration, sadness, depression, amiable relationship with his younger son.  Also, the film shows the constant hammering that the issue of abolition took; the effect of freedom on a sizeable group of African Americans, who did not ask to come to America.<br />This is a must see historical film.  I would recommend it to people who want more out of history and the people in this time frame.<br />People's politics and intimidation can be exhausting to watch.  Nevertheless, I love the film.  Linda Meyerle
B005T87QCI|4.0|Okay I got a new kindle and I bought the byob and 6 robots but I don't know how to get the purchases back
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie was tastefully and tactfully portrayal of a catastrophic disaster.  Family ties were heartfelt.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie- and so sad of the hundreds of thousands of men, women, boys and girls and animals<br />that did not survive.  Let this movie be a memorial for them!
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Despite all the hype about Apple and Steve Jobs it turned out I knew next to nothing about the man and his vision. Mr. Isaacson filled me in surprisingly well. This bio is both informative and occasionally fun to read. What I liked most is the wholeness of story: there were ups and downs, little details and global picture.
B0052U6O7G|5.0|He loves the fit and style. He runs on the Jr high track team and is pleased with the weight. We will see their durability over time. Shoes were delivered on time and as promised.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|What more can you ask for other than a case that protects your expensive headset as well as keeps it charged and ready to go.  Another benefit is you can use a standard micro USB cable to charge your headset instead of the proprietary one that comes with it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love it. Most amazing game ever, albeit slightly hard. It is very fun and you acually learn quite a bit about dinosaurs.
0739377957|4.0|This was a good book to read.  The story was excellent and it kept my interest through out the whole book.
1419707663|5.0|My son was so excited when I surprised him with this set. He's 10 and has never been a fan of reading. But he got through all three books in a few days and wanted the next set.
B004T32SOK|5.0|It's the best because free accounts start with 5 GB of space instead of the 2 GB that Dropbox and others provide. Box is the best way to transfer files from my Kindle Fire to my Windows & Mac laptops. I have a USB cable, but Box is just as fast and less hassle.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I like it because I am a kid and I can take pics of my friends and I so...  this is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
B007EECSFA|3.0|I enjoyed the novel but found it a bit too much switching from past to present.  But I do have to say I never saw &#34;the ending coming&#34;.  Wow !
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Anyone wanting to watch this favorite book come to life should watch this. Very entertaining and stays close to actual story line.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I didn't purchase this book for weight loss information. A family member had read it and suggested I read it.. It was eye opening about how foods are modified.  I've been interested since a ballot initiative failed in California regarding genetically modified labeling failed.  The book is an easy read but you have  to keep an open mind.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Like the game a lot..didn't really have any problems ...these are the types of games I love to play...So thanks...can't wait for more games like this for the kindle fire HD
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A wonderful read as always.  Kept my interest and a beautiful story.  I love to read a book that has a poignant story.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R.R. Martin does it again. This is an excellent book and would highly recommend this series to every one.
B0026SCMNM|2.0|Banal, not very colorful or gripping. Was hoping for real color on old Brooklyn and the Irish immigrants. But this was pretty shallow and run of the mill stuff. I'm surprised, because I think Colm Tobin is good. But I had really high expectations for this because of the author and I was let down. It's good if you are in the mood for something kind of 'small' and quiet. I guess I wasn't in a quiet mood.<br /><br />Marcianne Waters
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I finally discovered Nelson DeMille.  This first John Corey novel is a real page-turner.  Great dialogue and memorable characters, all delivered with a real sense of the history of Long Island.  I'm looking forward to the next one.
B0018LMZO4|3.0|Buy &#34;This is the Moody Blues&#34; instead. It has all of the best stuff they recorded. There you go man...keep as cool as you can.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George R.R. Martin does it again. This is an excellent book and would highly recommend this series to every one.
0307591549|5.0|Being happy makes you smarter, more efficient and more productive, which makes you happy. So, which came first, the chicken or the egg? Well, I think it's the chicken in this case. And the chicken is being happy no matter what. Not waiting, not looking, just being. And being happy. With what is. Then, share your happiness and see what happens. More productivity, more smarts, more cooperation, more accomplishment.<br />That's what this book says and this I believe, even before the book.<br />Worth reading. Worth sharing, especially for someone getting a new job or a college graduate or maybe, and maybe especially, for someone who is unhappy in his/her job currently.<br />I will keep this book and that's why I didn't do the Kindle version. This one goes next to other keepers like New Earth by Eckhart Tolle and some other really impressive books that I just can't think of now but surely would know if I was standing right in front of my bookshelf at home that holds all the 'bibles' i've collected over 30+ years.<br />Marcianne Waters, avid reader and avid happiness promoter (I hope)
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun for adults and children! This game is easy for young children to play. We love it.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|It's ok. I have the big Nirvana CD/DVD package and a lot of that stuff is hard on the ears but I'm glad to have it because there won't be much(or anything) else new coming our way.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|George R.R. Martin does it again. This is an excellent book and would highly recommend this series to every one.
0385349947|5.0|I know that I'm sharing it with my own personal college graduate, my daughter Caroline.<br />This is awesome. And so true. And so needed by so many women.<br />The time is now, Ladies. Not tomorrow, not yesterday, NOW.<br />Lean in. You deserve it.<br />M
B005HEQ4XQ|4.0|A lot of great episodes! Great stories and I've watched on TV when it aired ..but nothing like going back and watching the again!
B0012GMVG2|5.0|To me,this is Toto's best album. I was a little disappointed in the sound quality of the cd issue of the first album,but to these ears the sound on this,Toto's second album,is much better. Great playing and great singing and everybody knows &#34;Africa&#34;. A bargain at $4.99.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This is another great season. It does go away from the book a little in this season but was still very entertaining.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I love this movie and I gave it to my somewhat elderly parents so they can love it too. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a little long. I didn't find it so but I heard that from some DVD watcher friends and I want to make sure my reviews are honest and fair.<br />it's a great story made even more compelling by the truth of it and the fabulous performances, including Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as what's-his-name. DDL fans, like me, know that he delivers every time. This film is no exception and, in fact, he delivers beyond even the high expectations the public has for him. He really deserves all the accolades and awards he's garnered for this performance. He's not hot like he was in Last of the Mohicans but Abraham Lincoln just wasn't a guy you'd call 'sexy.'<br />Marcianne Waters
B00881PTRC|5.0|Been playing it for a bit tonight. I am really liking the graphics and the sound effects are ok as well. I didn't have the sound up enough to hear the music since it's past midnight. If you want a hangman game this one is the best one I have tried.<br /><br />It has four different themes which all change how the games look. I personally like the Stickman drawing version best and it's cute animations as you slowly lose the game.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Enjoy the game not only bingo but also too can chat with friends while you play<br /><br />So relax and have fun
0307742997|5.0|Nesbo is the answer to fill the void created by the untimely loss of Stieg Larsson.  This was my first Nesbo novel, but certainly not the last.  Unique complex characters are woven into an intricate plot that leads the reader down a twisted road to an unexpected but totally satisfying conclusion.  Harry Hole, a protagonist with foibles, is at the same time brilliant and also very human.  I believe he will become my favorite serialized detective very soon, if he isn't already.  My reading list changed after reading \\"The Snowman\\" with \\"The Leopard\\" moving to the top.  What a pleasure to find a new author of this caliber.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The movie was great it showed how Lincoln lived and his death at the theater. It was a great movie.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|So glad to add this to my DVD library.  Each time I see it,  I see new parts of the story.  If you are also a fan it's a MUST OWN!!!
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|It seems like more and more of the apps stop playing during or after the tutorial. This was no exception. I'm using a Kindle Fire.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife loves it. Personally, I'd rather be stung by a bee or stub my toe than ever watch another episode. But at least it keeps her busy for an hour or so while I do other things, such as write Amazon reviews or chat with friends on Facebook about how we used to have dreams or goals in life.
0810970686|5.0|I bought this book for my son who is a fan of the movies first and then became a fan of the books, according to the book I loved it had excited the development of the book, I liked a lot
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I am so happy to add this to my collection!!!! They did do a twist on the original version which I actually prefer.  Great performances and I look forward to seeing it over and over!!!!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I couldn't describe this book even if I tried it was so amazing. You couldn't believe the twists that happen or the dram. I read this book in one day it was so exciting and well breath taking. I swear at more than one point I couldn't breathe.
B00797MB0O|3.0|The movie itself, what I did manage to slog through, was only watchable because of Charlize. without her, I would give it no stars
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book, got in on Kindle. Really all I expected. Not much else to say about a mass produced book delivered wirelessly.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Intouchables is funny and entertaining. No special effects, just a story and good acting. Three of us watched it and all loved it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great game. Great graphics. Fun to play. Addicting to the mind.<br />This game is really fun. And it is free. My two favorite things in an app. Take it from me, you will enjoy playing this game.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I am obsessed with this show, and I was so excited when I ordered it for my Mom and I to enjoy it.  Love it!
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I decided to read this because I have always enjoyed seeing Sharon on TV. After reading 2 of her books, I learned that the Osbornes are a remarkable family with many positive facets to their characters and personalities. I had never been a fan of Ozzy simply because I do not like his music. Now, I still don't like his music, but I am a big fan of Ozzy, the person. In this book, he reveals just how remarkably funny, extremely likeable and unexpectedly humble he is. In addition to all the kookie behaviors he is well known for. Incidently, I am a 70 year old Southern gal with a firm belief in the saying, &#34;Dont judge a book by its cover&#34;. This book reaffirms that belief. I am looking forward to reading more books from this crazy, unpredictable family. They have experienced addictions, infidalities and numerous other heartbreaks. Yet they survive and often times florish, against all odds. Kudos to the Osbornes.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really like this book a lot.  I like anything Nicholas Sparks writes.  Want to see the movie and compare.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having read many books on this subject over many years, I found this accounting particularly credible because of the author's scientific background vis-a-vis the &#34;non-scientific&#34; extraordinariness of his experience and how he came to grips with it. It was a deeply moving account of his life and how this NDE affected him and changed his life perspective. Unless one goes into this reading as a skeptic with a closed mind, one would be hard-pressed to discount the supporting evidence in the form of the many doctors and family and friends who were so intimately involved, not to mention the many other documented accounts with so much commonality of experience.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I never found time to watch on Sunday nights but really wanted too. Appreciated being able to catch it on my schedule with Amazon Prime. Great show! Good stories and excellent acting. One of my faves.
B000FA675C|3.0|I liked Angels and Demons and Symbols a lot better.  More interesting from my viewpoint.  Not bad, but not great either.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Awesome that it's available in amazon prime! Great sci fi mystery thriller. Wholesome show and no need to expect some shocking horrible sex scenes. Just good storytelling and no gimmicks to make people want to watch it.
0062011847|5.0|With the onset of Mr. Pratchett's medical difficulties, I have often wondered if he will be able to continue writing the novels in this series that I love so well.  He has done well with this one and this is as fun as his various other disc world problems.  If you've enjoyed such fun things as 'night watch', 'going postal' or 'unseen University', you'll enjoy this one as well.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This has been one of the most fun things I do on my Kindle and Phone! I love how it re-draws your drawing for the person you are playing to guess...I am such a bad drawer that I wonder how anyone guesses my words! I love watching how other people draw their words. It's a hoot!
B0083GQVOC|5.0|Tilda Swinton made you believe this was happening. She is really the main character. Thought provoking and sad but in a watchable way.
0385349947|5.0|I think this is a great book that tells it like it is. Women should read it and think about it. The is little point in just being told what you want to hear. This book give you what you need to know about the world as it really is -- and what it truly takes to get ahead in what is still largely a man's world.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow free is actually quite enjoyable, and requires you to think ahead and recognize the patterns as they grow increasingly complex.  Up to approximately a 6 x 6 they are really no challenge as you learn the system.  The 9 x 9 patterns become increasingly complex and by around twenty there are a couple that are truly fiendishly difficult.  So far none have proved insoluble.  I recommend it is cheap easy fun.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|its very suspenseful and exciting. a very good drama/lawyer show that keeps you on the edge of your seat. does not disappoint!
B00BESCJII|5.0|I never read this book but I loved the movie. Well acted. The time frame is nicely depicted. Good rental.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|This is a great game. It is fun to play by yourself and with friends. I have not yet found any problems with this games. Graphics are 100% awesome. 5/5 game!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|this is a fun and engaging 3-D matching puzzle.  Nothing challenging in the basic mode, nothing surprising but enough different symbols to keep you busy as you run through the options and rotate the cube left right and up and down for a full three-dimensional immersive experience.  It was fun.  And has it takes anywhere from 5 to 10 min. to run through again it works well when you have a little ( Brainless) time to kill.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This movie tells about half of the story from Tolkien's book - The Hobbit. This movie tells the story of the first of the four &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; books (The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return on the King).
B00BESNKB8|4.0|I mean you can't go wrong with the RZA and lots of blood. The movie is that fantasy violence, and if that is your thing, this movie is for you.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is a B-E-A-U-TIFUL game! It is so good, that I was nearly addicted. Lots of towers, 'funky' monkeys, and mysterious Agents. Incredible graphics, but the game lags after a whole ton of levels. The game explains why. I love this game! 5/5 game!
B008133MDK|5.0|This is just as good as season one.  Definitely one you must see, especially if you enjoy a good detective story,
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved, loved, loved this book!!!  It kept me hooked to find out what was going to happen next.  If you want a great book that pulls at your heart, then this is your book.
B00AJLHUAS|4.0|i would recommend this product to any Roxy Music fan. this is an amazing interpretation of Bryan Ferry's catalog of music.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love both Star Wars and Angry Birds, so from my perspective, an epic game! Many different levels and locations, and special abilities such as Force Push, Lightsaber attacks, and blaster firing! I have found no problems with this game, and the graphics are A O.K.! 10/5 game!
1416960953|1.0|I did not read the review that recommended this for kids 13 and over.  My 9 year old granddaughter wanted this book and it was way too scary for herl
B00947N6D8|5.0|Went to the theater to see this movie. It gives a great message for the kids. Keep believing that is the way.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Some hilarious gems that had me laughing out loud to myself.  Overall, an enjoyable read with some genuine concern for women's issues interwoven throughout.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Such a great read! I couldn't put it down! Very well written. Makes you think this could have actually happened! Def give it a read
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!!!!!! it is so fun u shud get this app!!!!!!!<br />can be a little triky at times but other then that it is the best ever:)
B000FA675C|5.0|The Divinci Code is a great follow up to Angels and Demons and shows the talent of Dan Brown.  It is one of thoese books that once you start you cannot put it down.  A great read and look forward to reading all the Brown library.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I read this book for a social studies book project. It started out slow in the beginning but in the middle I couldn't put the book down. I was very pleased with this book. I would recommend this to a person who likes a good book about friendship.
B0044KJIHI|5.0|loved every episode but most of all loved the Lazarus,Homecoming and Ambush.  the series finale was awsome and at the same time  sad since it brought to conclusion the Smallville series. Will truly miss seeing Tom Welling.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|Another wonderful venture and offering by the lovely Dido. Variety abounds, even including Rap, which is not always the case with this sweet blond chanteuse. But the CD just works and delivers a treat to the ears. It is amazing how often the right song is picked for the Album title and this effort is no exception. Extremely listenable, non-fatiguing, even with the included rap variations, and always an interesting insight into her personal experiences, Dido has delivered yet again.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Great take on classic Hangman. You can choose word categories, some much more difficult than others. Currently playing from the SAT word lists. Thank you Amazon for this FAOTD. This game is worth the 99 cent price tag.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I'm already impatient waiting for the next one! Maxon better choose America! I read this book in 2 hours, and Marlee broke my heart!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very unique and interesting for kids and adults.  It becomes very addicting.  We can't wait to see what this company comes out with next.  Good work!
1250007208|4.0|This book was dumb in so many ways but I enjoyed it and would not have the author change a word. I will be reading her next book in the Cinder series in May. Hooray!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I absolutely love the Revenge Series!!! I can't wait for season 3. All the characters are amazing and I'm always on the edge of my seat!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This doesn't have all of the things in Xbox or pc but it is a really good game for traveling and if is worth the $6.99.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  I couldn't put it down and literally read it in a few hours.  The Selection had been a favorite of mine and I was so excited to see the story continue.  That said, I was actually very disappointed.  This book gave us a few more glimpses at characters and personalities and a bit more info on the strategical atmosphere of the country, but it seemed to be all &#34;filler.&#34;  I would have enjoyed it more if it had been the conclusion to the story.  I didn't see the necessity of this book, perhaps the conclusion will prove me wrong, but i feel like the set up for this book was useless, as I'm back to waiting again with little more than I had previously.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love this season and the tension between Tony and Ziva. This season's plot line has a few heart wrenches, but it's a great season!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best!!!! My daughter loves this game and best of all its free!!! Take my advice you got to buy this!!! It has many levels. If you love temple run, I'm telling you buy it!!!
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Its about as realistic as one would think it would be like living in those days. The character's play very well with each other. We need more of these historical type cast plays.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I like the way I can prop up my Kindle and read or watch hands-free, and also hold it like a book for reading,
B00BVYKWJI|4.0|Anyway who liked The Tudors and history generally. Of course, I like all kinds of TV series--Breaking Bad, Dexter, Homeland, Law & Order, Mad Men, Damages, etc. And I love Jeremy Irons
0062059963|3.0|After reading the first book, i was excited to finally get my hands on this. Let me tell you, IT'S NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Here's why..<br /><br />1. The book is way to short and compared to the previous book, and there is not a lot of action<br /><br />2. The characters and the plot are very predictable (and we all know that the king will die, the rebels will advance, america will marry maxen,the castes are destroyed and everyone lives happily ever after. THE END)<br /><br />3. This book is very expensive, especially for the number of pages it has (!!!!)<br /><br />4. The ending is quite lame, (*SPOILER*) Maxen: oh sorry America you're going home.. ( a few hours later) ..BUT WAIT! You're not! even though my dad hates you!<br /><br />In general, this book did not live up to my expectations (which honestly weren't that high). There is some attempt of interesting twists and turns, much like the previous book, but sadly did not work out. I would not call this a disaster, but there are many things that should be changed. Don't get me wrong, i love Kierra Cass and all the characters but compared to the previous book, The Elite is a mere shadow.
1451697686|5.0|The thing that drew me to this book was a feature in the April Martha Stewart. It was the pictures of Ms. Johnson's house that really struck me. It looks just like I want my house to look, clean and uncluttered. Ms. Johnson's motivation is imminently environmental, but mine is more just wanting a simpler, less wasteful, less self-indulgent life-style (so is hers, but she is largely motivated by the environment).<br /><br />I point out our different motivations because it does not matter what your motivations are to find this book helpful. This book is an extremely practical, easy-to-use guide to getting rid of the junk in your house and lifestyle. My bathroom is already transformed and I am so happy. I hung a sign on my door that I can see as I go out of the house that reads: &#34;THINK before you bring anything into this house. Do you already have something you can use instead?&#34;<br /><br />One can have the misapprehension that to live waste free is to become a hoarder - not so! It has a lot to do with not bringing unnecessary things into the house in the first place. I do not see myself going as far with it as Ms. Johnson - but what her book has done for me already was worth the read. You can use this book at your own discretion. As she says in the book, if you use it to dabble or to go whole hog with being waste free, you can still find help in this book.<br /><br />I only had a problem with some advice given on the first two pages of the &#34;Kids&#34; chapter, but I am not even going to tell you what the problem was because I would buy the book anyway and it is a world-view difference that doesn't have anything to do with the practicality and usefulness of the book.<br /><br />If everyone could live like this book advocates - what a clean, healthy place the world would be.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|The nicest pocket sized sharpener I've ever owned. The diamond coated rod is very handy for serrated edges, and I'd definitely recommend this one to amateurs and professionals alike.
B005HSL626|5.0|My son is a big fan.  He had played this before and was happy to get it on our Kindle.  Cute little game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Once you've watched a couple of episodes you're hooked. If you're reading reviews for season 2 you've probably already watched at least part of season 1 and know how good it is. Stop wasting your time reading reviews and watch another episode!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie was very well done.  Not only did my young grandchildren enjoy it and learn from it, but Pi's character provoked some very deep thinking on the part of the adults who watched it together.
1452115567|4.0|This book immediately caught my attention from the minute I heard about it since I also have a hound dog who is a rescue. I loved Maddie from the minute I saw her. She's an awesome dog and Theron is an awesome photographer/dog owner/human. But really...the book goes beyond that. It's an inspiration. It's a history. It's kind of even a love story.<br /><br />You should check it out. It's kind of amazing. Stop by your local bookstore, or just buy it from amazon. You won't be sorry. It's worth your time.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|While our daughters really enjoyed this movie, singing and laughing uproariously throughout, my husband and I spent most of our time smiling indulgently and glancing at each other in confusion.  How could our little angels think that puke and baloney boobs are so funny?<br /><br />Not that there weren't funny parts... there were some parts that made us laugh (almost all entirely due to Rebel Wilson, who did great with her role).  The songs were also great, for the most part.  On the down side, sometimes I was less than impressed by the hammy over-acting, especially evident in some of the smaller roles.<br /><br />I commented that the production/direction team may have tried a little too hard to make the humor as grand as Bridesmaids, and my husband (who didn't like this movie at all) said, \\"Basically, this movie is just Step It Up, without all of the cheer-leading.\\"<br /><br />He may have gotten his movies mixed up, but he had a strong point.<br /><br />Of course our daughters disagreed; they really did think this was a great film, and watched it again before the rental period expired.  I guess it's all in your perspective.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once you've watched a couple of episodes you're hooked. If you're reading reviews for season 3 you've probably already watched at least part of season 1 and know how good it is. Stop wasting your time reading reviews and watch another episode!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|It was okay, but not as great as I had expected.  You have to really pay attention to what was going on at the time, and researching Lincoln prior to watching it would help a lot.
B004G606K8|4.0|Loved the story, and the characters are endearing. I had trouble with keeping the names in order, I'm slight dyslexic, and my fiancee asking me every few minutes about the book he's read over 10 times made it difficult to give myself to the story completely.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I really enjoyed this adaptation of Jane Eyre.  To me, the lighting and scenery were nearly perfect; they managed to reproduce almost the exact atmosphere that I imagined every time I've read this classic romance.<br /><br />I loved the character interpretations by most of the cast, and thought that each actor chosen was a great fit, even if Rochester was a bit youngish (and pretty hottish).  Mia W was good as Jane, with the slight exception that I didn't always see \\"electricity\\" between her and Michael F.  The story itself still got my heart beating, though... as usual.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to others!
B005XLN97M|5.0|I can't tell you how many times we've been ripped off with cheap quality toys over the years.  It was a pleasure to finally find a product that is priced well, made well, and that snaps together with ease and precision (the parts fit well)!  It comes with a good amount of accessories as well, but no dolls.  Which is OK because frankly, we already have many.  Our 8 year old little lady loves her Barbie beach house! Nice going MATTEL!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Very Tarantino style film.  Entertaining, funny and keeps you paying attention.  Hated to see one character get bumped off, but the one who got it deserved it... Highly recommended.
B004WMKXWM|3.0|I loved the movie, but the lack of subtitles was a problem for my Spanish friend with whom I watched it.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone wanting to read a fabulous novel. It's a book that's hard to put down!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I love Washington all movies he is in, just another to add to the list. I highly suggest this movie.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Whenever I have free time, the phone is out and I'm trying to attract more fish to my reef. Great for all ages!
030758836X|2.0|The book goes on for about 50 pages too long, then stops two sentences short of anything resembling a satisfying conclusion.  The pacing is back and forth, although generally decent.  However, most of the twists and turns are fairly predictable and those that are unpredictable are unpredictable because they're ridiculous.  It is well written and does qualify as a page-turner, at least for the first two-thirds of the book.  There were, however, times in the last few chapters that I could have abandoned the book and not given it a second thought.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|The story starts off a bit slow, but there is good reason and it is excellent.  There is only mention of the one son that died, but he had two.  I feel like the edit could use some work, but excellent story and acting without too many battle scenes.  I'm not sure it came across how soon after the war ended that he was assassinated or why.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While Katniss' angst over her role in the revolution grew a bit tiresome, the book was a solid conclusion to the trilogy.
B00881PTRC|4.0|this game downloaded and functioned properly on my first gen kindle<br />I really enjoy word games and this one is done well - the animations on the man are cute and amusing (I picked wrong letters just to see what happened!!)  this isn't as easy as some would say - I did the animal version and came across words that were really difficult in that I had never heard of the animal - it also wasn't so ridiculously hard that you would get frustrated. well worth the .99 to buy this app - even better as the faotd.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Fun game, it reminds me of Mario.  Easy play and while stuck in the bed due to an ailment it kept me entertained and out of trouble...
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great acting, great story, quick moving, excellent editing.  I don't want to give the story away, but it is well worth the time and money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter wouldn't let me see the movie until I read the book; so glad I did.  Totally worth it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i LOVE IT but i wish they would add internet on it and levers and all so some pressure pads ass well
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I really do not recommend this game.  Although it's free to download, you can only play it a few times before it times out unless you log on to facebook.  And even then, you have to pay for extra play time.  App is free, game is not necessarily free.
B00BS7HNTK|2.0|One or two of the songs are good but the rest all sounds the same and puts me to sleep.
B002LS4M9E|4.0|Can't believe it took me so long to get to know this album. His voice is mellow yet strong. This is the perfect album for me to wind down to after a long day.
B008TT7CXW|2.0|I had bought a previous DiMeCard to hold 8 microSD cards - it works well and I have no concerns that I will lose a card. Also, it is very thin and uniform. I decided to try this version as I often use an SD adapter with my microSDs and this would have made things really convenient. However, this card is slightly thicker ... to accomodate the SD cards, so acceptable, but as soon as I inserted an SD adapter, I noticed that it seemed very loose.<br />BEWARE: if you shake the card, the SD falls out. If you drop it on a desktop, you risk losing the SD.<br />The microSDs seem to stay in well, although the previous DiMe had a definite &#34;lock in&#34; that I don't feel with this card. I definitely will not trust any important SD cards to remain secure so basically I'm left with a storage unit for 4 microSDs ... oh well, better luck next time, but I won't be buying another one of these.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Thanks a lot!!!  This game app was so fun, pretty and addicting--I stayed up way too late playing it!! And, the background music was very soothing. I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire for my grandson when he comes to visit, but I really like it!  Buy it! But watch out, or you will be up too late, too!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Not to take away from Season 2 but the intense drama really opens up in this season.  One of the best series I've seen in a long time!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I enjoy all of Jack Reacher's books.  He is a great charater. Good man. I do reccomend this to all adventure lovers.  I have enjoyed them all.
0385349947|5.0|This book blew me away. It's so interesting--a real page-turner. This surprised me, because I had dreaded reading it, from the standpoint that I hate sexism and hate stories about women being mistreated or underestimated. Yet it was not depressing, at all. Instead, it's positive throughout, and made me feel more hopeful and inspired.<br /><br />Sheryl Sandberg and Nell Scovell capture everything that matters about each complex issue they address, and the way that they articulate things that are hard to articulate, the way they give credence to each \\"side,\\" the fact that they are not glib or strident... Everything is analyzed so intelligently and beautifully stated. I couldn't get over how brilliantly they pull apart the hairballs they took on. I couldn't get over how good the writing is. It's an incredible accomplishment on many levels: the writing, the big and small issues it covers, the revelations it contains regarding assumptions we have and how to overcome limitations we put on ourselves.<br /><br />All of the new research results that they relay in the book were fascinating. I learned so much, which surprised me, because I thought I knew everything about sexism and the difficulty of succeeding in business. For example, weirdly, it never even occurred to me that young women should be gently challenged when they lean back and don't take opportunities at work, in preparation to quit to have kids. The research findings were awesome--they blew apart so many assumptions I had become resigned to (\\"Okay, I guess young women HAVE to quit their careers in order to raise their kids right\\" \\"I guess if you try to work and raise your kid you HAVE to be harried and miserable,\\" etc.).<br /><br />I found it so helpful that Sheryl discusses all of the \\"mistakes\\" she made along the way--having her assistant peek out to the hallway to see if anyone was around before she snuck out of the office at 5:30, etc.--these anecdotes were key because I often feel ashamed of little things I've done in the past, before becoming more \\"enlightened,\\" and it made me realize it's human, it's understandable that we have all done certain things in order to not be penalized.<br /><br />Nell must feel an enormous sense of accomplishment and must be so proud of the book. It is a landmark work. I keep wanting to say, \\"Townspeople! Listen to me!\\" and make people read it. It's so, so, so good.<br /><br />It's so bizarre to me when there's controversy over something that seems so natural and true. The book has sparked controversy, despite it being so evenhanded, and throughout the text, the authors constantly, repeatedly validate all women's choices. It's so irksome the way the media churns up controversy and tries to make everything sensationalistic. But it's even more irksome that people fight books like this. It is frustrating that anyone could make a big thing over whether or not they \\"like\\" Sheryl Sandberg, which apparently has been debated. To me, this is not about \\"Hm, is she humble enough? Do I like how she wears her hair?\\" This is so much more important than anyone's personal sense of who she is or whether or not they find her threatening, or whatever is really at the heart of their criticism. It's about young girls getting the message that they can be anything and do anything. It's about the girl and the guy at the starting line of the marathon (i.e., their careers) getting the same encouragement all the way through the race.<br /><br />If I had helped write this book, I'd drop the mic. It's an unbelievable accomplishment and it's a generous gift. I love that it exists in the world and it gives me hope and fills me with pride every time I look at it--I'm proud of both the women and the men that helped this book come into being.
B00ABO609A|4.0|This was a good show about two guys who hooked up, messed up, and broke up.  A little hard to follow but kept a good pace.  A good show.
0345803485|5.0|I loved these books. But I did have the realization that it was the author's fantasy no holds bar. Not once wondering if people would like it and what they would want. Almost like reading her diary. She never imagined it getting this much attention. What would all of our fantasies be like if wrote them down.....She is the first one to admit the writing isn't her first priority. Sometimes I get so bored with authors trying to prove how smart they are and worry about the writing before the story. Having said all of this I needed more to read after these books and googled a couple. Well let me tell you what I found was wonderful but make Christian look like a gentleman...prim and proper. It has opened up a new world for me and wish I was more open to sexuality when I was younger. Now I don't care as much what people think. It is a revelation....
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I choose this rating because this was not one of my favorit ones.  But I like them all.<br />Jack is a great person. Only if he was real.  He seems real to all of us that enjoy reading Lee Child's books.  I recomend them to all adventure lovers.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Breathtaking!  I sang along with every song.  One of the best movies I've ever seen.  I'm sure I'll watch it for many years to come.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great app. Just wish you could do more with search options and have more choices like online. Still a great app, with no problems so far.
B005LAII80|1.0|I am a huge comic book fan and I turned it off in the middle of the movie. I suffered through the last installment of the Twilight Movies without turning it off - that should tell you something...
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect and was happy with this movie. Denzel is always a fantastic actor and of course a great storyline.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Before I watched this movie, I had no idea who Hugh Jackman was.  While watching him morph from an embittered chain-gang prisoner to a kind, faith-centered father figure, I'm sure I fell in love with him.  Then, afterwards I googled him and discovered he's the same age as my own daughter!  I now love him as a son.  Wonderful voice, fantastic actor!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Enjoyed the first half. Violence in the second half was way over the top! Wish I'd stopped watching in the middle!
B00942G4UA|4.0|This show focuses on some pretty nasty components of the food industry. It makes one want to stop eating. At least not store bought foods.<br />Eye opening.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Looked at several apps,none came close to the information i was looking for.I would have paid for the right app,and this was FREE.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|Did what I wanted it to do, easily, inexpensively.  While working with clients I can see what I'm doing on my computer and show it to them on a large screen TV.  .
B005H9B44A|5.0|i loved this movie. The relationships (father/son, brother/brother....etc..) throughout the movie was very impressive. I liked how orgins were explained, it was such a great movie I brought to watch regularly. I appreciated the love story.....clean and nice to watch, so different from what is seen in most movies today. Overall I would give this movie more than 5 stars if I could. GREAT MOVIE!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I am often disappointed with the film version of a book I liked. Not so in this case. While a few subtleties and nuances are necessarily lost in the movie, it tracks very well. Violent concept, sadly, but you knew that didn't you. That said, it's a good flick.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book really got me thinking about the importance of family and friends no matter how mentally unstable. U always need someone there. Silver linings may help you get through the day but reality can be much sweeter when you embrace it. This book is amazing it gets five stars from me. I couldn't hardly put the book down . I felt  I knew each of the characters personally. I could definitely understand their pain, in the writing. All in all this book was an easy to understand and easy to fall in love with kind of book. Highly recommended.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Very well written book providing the reader with two simultaneous stories -- the grown Jamie McCloon and Number 86, Jamie as a young orphan horribly mistreated in an orphanage in Ireland.<br /><br />At times tragic, humorous, and very real this story keeps your interest up until a very surprising end.  Loved the book!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this a lot to help relax me.  it is quick and fun.  it is simple but challenging.  I can play it while my family is watching Tv.
B00BF11STU|3.0|an opportunity to weave historical, cultural, religious & political context into the drama of the search for bin laden LOST!  with such little effective defense at his compound, hard to imagine that capturing bin laden alive was not a real option, given the vast array of technology available to effect such as outcome.  one left with the sense that zero dark thirty is code for WANTED:  BIN LADEN DEAD OR DEAD!
B004XANKVO|5.0|I did a lot of research before deciding on this backpack and I am very happy with my decision to get this one.<br />There were a few things that I wanted:  a “crush proof” place for my sunglasses and iPhone, a place for the iPad, easy to store under the seat in front of me when flying, and plenty of room to keep my travel supplies in (or workout clothes when not traveling).  This backpack met/exceeded all those expectations.<br />It also has plenty of pockets and lots of storage space.<br />My only complaint that I have is that it does not have the clip for my keys.  Every other travel backpack that I have had as this feature and I didn’t realize how much I miss it.  Maybe it is just 20 years of being use to clipping my keys while I travel – but it has been an adjustment.  I now zip them in one of the pockets.  (I have considered looking into getting a key clip sewn in).<br />One thing to keep in mind – this backpack is big.  It holds A LOT of stuff.  If you don’t need something this you may want to get the next size down.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|great to stream the laptop to my nexus 7<br />high definition<br />fast connection<br />smooth video<br />very happy with the app<br />also, it's free!
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I liked this just because I liked the series all together but I did have a bit higher expectations. Hopefully if they make another one...it'll get 5 stars from me. But it was fun to watch as a family.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|The game is fun and it is a challenge to get through all the levels.  I did not care for the required main character especially in the daily challenges.  Ronin is very slow and heals at a snail pace.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Video was clear and easy to watch.  The story is a high class soap opera.  Great fun.  Love the costumes and the settings.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Damn good read.  Took a bit to get your head around the different stories within the book but its really very clever.
B00BU8QOII|5.0|Not many movies make everyone in the room cry. This film was so incredible and leaves you humble about life and family. I would recommend this to everyone.
B005H9B44A|3.0|A bit cheesy but entertaining to watch at 1am if there's nothing else on. Plot could of been better and special effects were okay. Nothing really to rave about.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Negatives: quite sluggish beginning, but the intriguing subject caused me to continue. Typically I abandon books with this slow of a start, but  being a teacher, I'm familiar with children exhibiting a variety of behaviors. Since I was reading a novel, and in this case, &#34;Silver Linings,&#34; I was  frustrated to read the phrase &#34;silver linings&#34; ten times too often.<br />Positives... real life isn't a novel, and the protagonist's struggles were quite realistic. Haven't seen the movie and usually dislike movies made from books, however, knowing Tiffany was played by Jennifer Lawrence made the visualizing interesting and fun.
B0023S50DO|4.0|Great movie showing more character development and a story of relationships. This was one of my favorite &#34;meteor&#34; type movies. Robert Duvall and Elijah Wood were exceptional. A true testament of the human spirit.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|It was a good story line. Just the right amount of drama and action for this story. Logan and Elizabeth and Keith were interesting.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like it at first, but keep reading.  It really evolves.  The historical parts will bring about many feelings, but the story really captures your heart.  Definitely worth reading.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|Mama was the scariest horror movie I ever watched, mainly becasue of the images that ran through my head, even after the movie was over. I could still picture Mama's creapy figure. The supense also played a big role in the movie, it kept you wondering if anyone would ever find the little girls and were they alright. The scenes in Mama added emotion to the movie, in my opinion the emotion set in Mama was cold and tradgic, due to the father's behavior.Another thing that made Mama scary was the sounds and music, that made chills run down your spine. Although Mama was a good movie, I don't plan to watch it again, becasue it was by far the scariest movie i ever watched.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever<br />Its just like computer. Its awesome But on survival mode you need to make more visitation
B001MVYUPC|4.0|Though sometimes it is quite long and you can feel boring it a quite objective film about this important leader for India and the way he deals with big problems withouth violence.<br />Ivonne
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I loved it. From beginning to end, this is not one to miss. Great yet predictable story. Had me laughing or smiling through the entire movie. 5/5 hands down.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|I was appalled by what a mess Jackson made of The Hobbit.  He took a simple, charming tale and warped back to the Lord of the Rings, which he had already butchered.  His pale, anorexic looking Bilbo Baggins was ridiculous.  Has he ever read the book?  How about the description of hobbits at the beginning of the book?  This was about the worst $14.99 I ever spent.
