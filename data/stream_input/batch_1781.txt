B003JTHXOK|5.0|Decided to purchase the e-book before the movie comes out!  Love anything that Nicholas Sparks writes.  It was hard to put my kindle down.  Now I can't wait to see the movie!
0945001193|5.0|The book is very informative in respect of having an insight into the subject's beliefs and values.<br />I would recommend the book to anyone who has a genuine interest in world history.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a really good addition to the series. It's a bridge book between the last and the next. It answers some questions, but leaves a lot to be answered in the next book. Can't wait for the next story!
B00946ZOT8|5.0|great seller my daughter loves it she plays with it all the time and has it with the rest of her twilight stuf
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the way he loved her. It was nice that he found freedom and release when he wasnt expecting it.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Could not beat the price for a two disc platinum edition. My kids will love it for christmas. This came on time and before Christmas. Super happy, thank you for such great service.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Fun game for all ages. The game begins easy and increases difficulty with each level.  The tutorial in the beginning is simple enough for a 4 year old to understand.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|There seems to be a lot of confusion about Ultraviolet around here, so I mainly wanted to correct the misconception that you can't download a digital copy.  You CAN.  Sign up for a Vudu account on vudu.com.  Then when you fill in the code (on whatever website the movie tells you) select the Vudu option (most all of them work with Vudu at this point).  The movie will appear on your Vudu list within the hour.  You can then download the movie to your PC with the Vudu To Go application.  This allows you to have all your digital copies in one place AND gives you the ability to download them.  Hopefully people will stop 1-starring movies due to limitations that aren't really there.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, it was a great ending to the trilogy.  It doesn't match Dark Knight in terms of overall quality, but that would have been nearly impossible.  It stands up well on its own and I look forward to watching it again when the Blu-ray releases this week.
B00979CS50|5.0|This is not one of Neil's more original or tuneful albums - the songs serve as a vehicle for the lyrics - but the message is clear.  Some of us out here still feel strongly that it's wrong to ruin a planet in the name of greed, and to constantly devise ways to take more than you need.  Neil hits the nail squarely on the head, as the Rolling Stone reviewer said, &#34;He's MAD!&#34;  As in angry and fed up with the constant stream of bs from the commercial sector.  It's recorded in a deliberately murky and reverb-drenched bathroom-at-a-dance hall sound.  It might take a little getting used to, but if your a Neil Young and Crazy Horse fan, you'll like it.  Much better than, say, &#34;Living With War&#34;.  Being a musician, I went out and played a half-learned version of the title track &#34;Psychedelic Pill&#34; at a local club, just to &#34;amplify&#34; the message as soon as I could, and it went over pretty well, so that's a plus.  Get it if you like Neil - it's that simple.
0143121316|5.0|This book gave me a lot of insight as to how China changed in the last century and the US diplomacy went into deal with it.
B008S847X2|4.0|I have been following John McLaughlin since the good ol' Mahavishnu Orchestra days, and there are well-known reasons why they won't return, but John says in Guitar Player Magazine (I think) that this is his life statement up to this point.  Like many technically erudite tour-de-force albums, this one is very sophisticated and technically baffling in its difficulty, but there are no memorable lyric lines, no soulful, soaring melodies, with the immaculate rhythm section pumping it up to the stratosphere.  It's the same critique that can be applied to Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and others who have the chops, but don't write hit songs, because you can't remember how they go.  In comparison, Neil Young's melodies are very simple, yet they burn into your soul and run in your heart for days.  This is more of a listen-in-the-car-on-a-trip CD than something to get into in the living room.  But it's still very good and is state-of-the-art fusion jazz - a much needed dose of clarity in an otherwise rap, country and fizzy pop infested soundscape.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Fun concept.  Tim Burton's hand is all over it.  Fun vehicle for Mr. Depp.  Probably not something I'd want to see a 2nd. time.
B0089XH38M|5.0|AVG has always been the best for your PC and now....it's great on my Android. I wish the interface was better and more comprehensive but all in all, it's a great app.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|Some fun scenes.  Good special effects.  A couple laughs.  Didn't really work, as a whole, for me.  Nice try, though.
B0076NKNLA|2.0|I loved this movie and I thought it was great. The problem is the quality coming from the Amazon stream. I have a HD TV and the quality of the stream was very poor. Since I've streamed from Netflix and Hulu, I know this is because of Amazon and not because of my equipment. I won't stream again from them!
B004T340QY|5.0|Great dialog.  Great story.  Great acting.  Great music.  Top of my list for top movies of all time and Coen brothers pix.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was the first book I've read by this author and it won't be my last! I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day. Loved it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the intertwining stories amongst the various classes in the series.  Really good acting, but what about Mr. Bates????  Wait until next season, I guess.
044024630X|4.0|These rarely make an impression on me enough to remember one from the other.  That said, Jack Reacher has a rye personality that is engaging and I look forward to being entertained by each one.  I have forgotten which story this one is but I am sure it was amusing.
B001NKI60W|4.0|I was super excited to hear they were making this into a movie...because I adored the musical! However, I think the casting got a little too concerned with big names rather than focusing on the music and dancing. Now, that's not to say that I didn't enjoy it. I did! I do! I just think that some potential was lost with casting choices.<br /><br />All in all - a FUN movie!
B008Q09K2U|3.0|Aspects of this book gripped me.  I was reading it en route to Kabul and there were many similarities about the security situation.  In fact, it made ulta-cautious for a little while.  I am John Corey fan!  Absolutely!  But there were too many smart-alec comments interspersed throughout.  A few would be great but this book lays them on with a shovel.  After enjoying Up-Country, the use of Brenner was fine but, in here, two-dimensional.  c.f. General's Daughter and Up-Country.  I am a strong DeMille fan and will remain so.  The ending jusitifed my perserverance in reading this book.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|After all the bad things I heard about this movie, I am SO SAD that I didn't ignore them and see this in the theater! This was a beautiful story with great intrigue and fantastic imagery. I cannot recommend this movie enough.<br /><br />I'll watch this one over and over.
B008KE3960|5.0|Blends several popular mobile genres with strong tower defense roots, very satisfying for short or long sessions. Amazon games is for real!
6304698658|5.0|This is a \\"must see\\" at our house. The Christmas Season doesn't officially start until I put this in the player (usually in late November) and let it play. I think the only movie that I can quote more than this one is Spaceballs! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|you have to get this!  it is beasty. you have to get it!  demon monkeys! power ups it is epic!
0525952926|4.0|I found this second installment in Follet's trilogy much more readable and entertaining than his first. In fact, I remember almost nothing of \\"Fall of the Giants\\". I felt for most of the characters in this volume, as their storylines progressed. I was even educated about certain parts of history I was not aware of. Overall, I found it a thoroughly enjoyable book, and look forward to the final one.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have a good time playing this game. You also talk to some very nice people. Wish I would have found this game sooner.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app rocks! I used to be so bored before I got this awesome app! I totally recommend it. Good luck!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Always a much anticipated event as to when Vince Flynn's next book will come out.  I wish we didn't have to wait so long for the next one but realize perfection cannot be done overnight.
0316069434|5.0|Harry Bosch is back, this time investigating a murder that took place during the LA Rodney King riots of 1992, and which he cursorily investigated at the time as a young detective.<br /><br />Because of the chaos of the riots, he and his investigative team were hopscotching from crime scene to crime scene, never doing much more than a simple bag-and-tag before moving on to the next scene, but this one has stuck with him for all these years.<br /><br />New evidence has come to light in the form of a gun possibly tied to that murder, and Harry feels compelled to dig into the case to see if he can finally achieve a resolution, as well as justice for the forgotten victim.<br /><br />The case has ramifications that reach all the way back to the combat theater of the first Gulf War, and Harry has to dig deep while fending off political obstacles in his own department.<br /><br />Even if you've never read another Bosch book before this one you'll find yourself captivated by this well-told story. Tight plotting and pacing, plenty of action as well as detecting, well-realized three-dimensional characters... it's all here.<br /><br />This is Connelly at his best. A solid 5 stars.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|excellent.action-packed and a lot of very good superhero type fun.if you are searching for a little break from reality this movie will give you a great ride.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My friend told me about this app a long time before Amazon had this app! I love it and I hope you will get it and love it, too! DRAGON VALE!!!!!!!!!
B0043RSK3K|4.0|This is perhaps the best book on the subject and out distances Zimm's True History of the U. S.  mainly because it is current taking in the past 120 years. Stone should be proud of this work and for the ten part series on PBS. Actually he's done many young minds a service by understandting the other side of the coin.
B00992CF6W|3.0|how do you use TNT &hellip; I mean I know how to put it down but how do you make it explode?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this even more then the first. I could do with a little less in depth sexual descriptions.....I know what's going to happen....they've done this all over the book.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Fun game to play. nice change from the bird games. Fun for the whole family but its definitely a 'Dads'  game!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book for the mere fact that it didn't hold back. The initial love story is very typical, but still makes you want to believe this could happen to you!
B004SUWR2C|1.0|This application malfunctioned and would not completely download to my kindle fire. It was a complete waste of money. Don't waste your time.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Can't wait for season two to be available online, this show keeps you on your toes. It's an emotional roller coaster, and had me tearing up all over the place,  then wanting to sleep with the lights on. Haha. All in all give it a shot, you might have to watch 2-3 episodes to get hooked.
B003O85W3A|5.0|The Suburbs is a very good album by a very good band. Although not the caliber of their magnificent debut &#34;Funeral,&#34; it is still an engaging listen. The theme of growing up is a very relatable one, and each song does it's part to help enforce it. Although they are &#34;slower&#34; songs, they are still just as enjoyable as anything on their previous CDs. Some of my favorites are &#34;Sprawl I&#34; and &#34;The Suburbs (Cont.)&#34; just because of the emotional value of them.<br /><br />One addition to this is that I got the Special Edition from Amazon instead of just a normal version, which was quite a nice surprise. It comes with 2 additional songs (&#34;Culture War&#34; and &#34;Speaking in Tongues&#34;) plus a short film called &#34;Scenes From the Suburbs.&#34; The 2 songs are alright, but I can see why they didn't make it onto the vanilla version of the album. As for the short film, it is really well made. I really enjoy the dialogue of the kids, because it reminds me a lot of how my friends and I talk (myself being 17). One funny thing about it is Win's acting. When they ride by him as a police officer, he says his line kind of funny. It took me out of it for a moment, but it didn't ruin it or anything.<br /><br />Final Word: Great Album, and the additional stuff makes the 10 bucks it cost a steal.
B00846REIS|4.0|Yes, it's very similar to fifty....but Eva is a way better character then Ana was. She's strong, confident and been through her own struggles, which adds to the already complicated relationship. Gideon is gorgeous of course but has this underlying secret that your just dying to figure out. All in all good read....beware 3rd and potential 4th aren't released until may 2013.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|This album is my second favorite album of all time. Every song on here is emotional and very well made. Justin Vernon and his gang of highly talented musicians make such interesting music, all in a matter of 40 minutes.<br /><br />The title of this review is kind of a lie, however. When I first listened to the album, I didn't really like it all that much. I thought it was one of those albums that spanned and hour and a half, each song lasting 7 minutes, and were really dense and hard to listen to. Obviously, I didn't listen to much of it. However, after revisiting it later (and hearing &#34;For Emma...&#34; and loving that) I realized it was b-e-a-you-tiful. The lyrics are impressionistic, but very well written. Reading an article of Vernon's with Pitchfork, he said that he was very meticulous with his lyrics, going so far as to see if they looked good written on paper as well as how they sound.<br /><br />If I could sway anyone into listening to this, I would say &#34;DO IT RIGHT NOW!&#34; This deserves all of the praise in the world.
1401224792|3.0|The story is OK, but not as interesting as most of the other books.  It is better than the last Jack of Fables (which was miserable to finish).<br /><br />Lots of violence and nudity.  Someone else mentioned inconsistencies.  How are lopping off wolf heads killing them since they regenerate, and only fire or silver kills them?  I just didn't like the story much, even beyond that.<br /><br />Bigby seems true to character, except that I can't remember him manipulating winds before - seems inconsistent with his not accepting his father.
B008XTVWHK|5.0|This was a movie I saw on TV a while ago & I want to own it. It may be a B movie but it is pretty good.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|the art of storytelling is taken to new heights in this dramatic tale. I can't wait to see how it is interpreted in film.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's fun and challenging........it gets harder each puzzle. It's a real brain teaser. Endless hours of fun. I really like it.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|The entire trilogy is strong. Even with 30 songs, I did not feel the need to fast forward through more than a few tracks. I would describe The Weekend's style as a mix of Kid Cudi and Usher with a propensity for the F bomb. You can definitely enjoy a romantic interlude with it as background music.<br /><br />It's worth the investment - 20+ great songs for the price of one album.<br /><br />Skip the MP3s and get the CD. You can rip your own lossless music files. I've compared the MP3 files to the CD and it's night and day. You lose at least a third of his voice range with the MP3 version.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|the whole series is a good read.  Haven't enjoyed a series of books this much since reading The Hobbit and Lord of the rings many years ago
B00000272N|5.0|Melodic , visceral, dark, haunting, vocally immense, atmospheric, harmonized angst and beautiful prose. This is an album of albums, a gen-x time capsule to us, the cold war kids, the slackers, the angry, the children of divorced parents , the minimum wage workers, the high school drop outs, the leather jacket smokers social club .....You don't listen to this album..you bleed with it.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|I'm glad they put this out so I could buy it!! It got here quick and no damage at all!!<br /><br />Thanks!!
1616960922|5.0|Brought to you by OBS reviewer Sammy<br /><br />Beware of spoilers!<br /><br />Wow, what a lovely well written novella, I loved it ! There was a contest on goodreads that I signed up for when I saw the cover. I know don't judge a book by it's cover, but the cover is beautiful and after reading the book it fits perfectly to the story. I didn't win the contest, I did get lucky and am thankful that it was a book on the OBS list of books to review. This is the first book by this author I have read and I am so glad that I had the opportunity to do so.<br /><br />One of things with the Fantasy genre for me is,  that in other reads in the past there are the over abundance of odd names for people etc. In this story I was able to follow the characters without any trouble, the author made things so clear. With Sanderson's style of writing when introducing someone into the story you felt like you knew them. The way he describes things makes you see and feel it. Clearly a super skill and one which will have me checking out his other books.<br /><br />My favorite character of course was the always observing  Shai, her way of looking at things was interesting and very Zen like, in fact the whole book really took on some of the Zen and no Zen differences throughout the whole story.<br /><br />\\"No person was one single emotion: no person had only one desire. They had many and usually those desires conflicted with one another like two rosebushes fighting for the same patch of ground.\\"<br /> This concept could be found in one of my philosophical /Buddhist books. All of the prose was strong and made things very visual. The way the author explains the magic is amazing, how Shai was able to change the window back to it's former glory, how everything has an identity is a  great concept. Then there were the ruling people who didn't look at the full picture and wanted to abuse their power for selfish gains or the soldier who was one dimensional in his passion to protect the Empire and hishatred of Shai. That was great, he never changed in the story. One of my favorite parts, there were many, was when Gaotona fully understood why Shai had to burn the painting. He understood her pain and how she still had to do it.<br /><br />This story had such a wonderful balance with the world , characters and magic building, that I truly hope the author will explore it more with Shai and the world she lives. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for future books.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for young adults and  to anyone who enjoys the Fantasy genre and magic.<br /><br />This review and more at openbooksociety dot com
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I have only seen a couple versions of this movie but this one is my favorite of them.  I read the book and whereas it had been awhile when I watched the movie I just thought they did a good job with this one.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Fate throws together Megan, a women who can't fall in love but wants a child and Connor who won't fall in love but wants a family. After several drunken hours, they feel a connection and work out how they can both get what they want by having a marriage based on respect and shared goals with no expectations of love. So they get married. Yeah.  That sounds like a great plan.<br /><br />At first I thought I might actually like this book, even though my expectations weren't high. I do love books where people who don't know each other very well get married, for whatever convoluted reason, and then find love.  Connor and Megan were both very likeable at first but then...enter the angst.  And keep the angst going until I was forcing myself to finish it.  I should mention I despise too much angst. LOL<br /><br />Anyway, it was a decent read.  Not great, but not awful.  And even though this is one book that didn't have an epilogue and really needed one, I would still say it was worth a read if you're looking for something short and fluffy.
B008PEXCBM|3.0|The movie is a classic so we wanted our son to see it. We own an HD TV and paid the extra for the HD version but the quality was awful and we regretted renting it through Amazon.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't stop reading about Christian and Anastasia!  It was exciting and the characters were very real.  I would love to meet someone like Christian, and be able to fully enjoy him as Ana did!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I started watching Castle on a lark and got into it.  Mostly because of the interplay between the 4 main characters.  Each<br />show is an enjoyment to watch but I had to catch up on the story line.  It has taken me 3-4 weeks to figure out the story line<br />and how it all interacts.  You need to watch the show on a regular basis to figure out it is a story being told over the year<br />not just one week.  The show is well written and does not take itself too seriously.
B007SGM084|5.0|After reading Fifty Shades, I had to read the next two books too see how it all turned out!  The romantic scenes did become a bit repetitious, but otherwise very exciting!
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a good game. I am not so into having to buy credits but other then that I like it. I really like the original Virtual City.

B0086700CM|3.0|temple run is an ok game. once you play it like 5 or 10 times you get tired of it because its not different levels its the same one over and over again all you do is beat your score so it isn't very fun.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|As much as I love this series, I must admit I'm having second thoughts about purchasing the 2nd Season, at least right now.<br /><br />The primary reason is the pricing. I have no problem paying for something I want, but the \\"bundle\\" option that Blu Rays are all coming out with these days is just ridiculous. I DO NOT NEED a DVD copy nor a Digital copy, I just need the Blu Ray. The fact that they want to charge an extra 20-30 dollars to force feed me the DVDs and useless digital copy without an alternative is just too much.<br /><br />As for the series, the first season was better. The second season took too many liberties with the story. I know that there has to be changes for the adaptation to the screen, but it was too much. The season wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as the first.
B004GYY714|3.0|tunein isn't the best app because in every radio station it has to many advertisements and they papyri like 5 songs and that's it after that just advertisments

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I liked season 1 of American horror story so I have continued to watch this season. At first this season began slow but it has definitely gotten progressively creepier. Really enjoying it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn doesn't disapoint in his latest installment of the venerable Mitch Rapp spy series.<br /><br />His ability to weave a story line from headlines you can read in any world newspaper is amazing.  I always look forward to a new Vince Flynn novel!
B009GJCFL8|5.0|The other reviewers have summed up this live album's strengths - great sound, great playing, and catchy hook after hook.  Though many may disagree, Asia are probably better now than they were in 1982 - and their last three albums prove them to be a real band now, not a hastily assembled \\"supergroup\\".  For fans, this live album is a nice bonus.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I have personally owned 5 of these headsets from Turtle Beach including the original model for the PS3 system. I wanted to like Turtle Beach headsets, and very specifically the PX21 because the price is great. Unfortunately there is little and less I can say about these headphones that is positive but I will start with that anyway. The price is great, lowest cost you can find for decent quality audio in a gaming headset, based on this alone the PX21 has no competition. You can typically pick these up for $80 at any retail location and of course about $20 less on Amazon. However, outside of the original P21 design I had purchased, I have not had a set that made it more than 1 year without breaking. My original set last just over 2 years before the right ear cup lost sound and the mic cut in and out if the wire moved which wasn't too big of an issue truly. (I didn't take the best care of them) My second set were the slightly redesigned PX21 and they lasted just 5 months before having the same issue. Repeat process with numbers 3 and numbers 4. At this point I had only paid for the Second set (first was a gift) and I had been able to exchange all the others when they broke. The last pair I had to purchase again because I had lost the receipt when I moved which wasn't too big of an issue again. This last set which broke on November 26th, I owned for exactly 8 months and took care of them as if they were a newborn infant. Regardless of whether or not I could get them replaced with the warranty, I have come to realize that these are just cheaply made. It's not a matter of if they will break, only a matter of when and if it will be a physical break or if the wiring will break. I can absolutely not recommend these to ANYONE for any reason because it is just a complete waste of time and money. The hassle of dealing with returning them every few months is just not worth it to me and probably to you as well. I am not here to promote or sell you on other brands but I would suggest looking at Sony brand for either 20 bucks more or the higher tier for $70 bucks more. The DPX21 are the exact same build but come with a sound converter box that you plug into so don't be fooled into thinking you are buying a higher quality product. Several people have mentioned the Turtle Beach PX5's but at this point, I am not willing to trust Turtle Beach with more of my money. They make poor quality items and sell them at premium prices.

B003XT60KO|5.0|This book is chock full of common sense.  I highly recommend it for a broad understanding of the way our economy ought to be working instead of the way it is and has been run by all the self-centered politicians during the past 100 years or so.

0316017922|4.0|My daughter needed this for a college class. Amazon is a good place to start looking for text books at a decent price, The book its self was a great read. Daughter talked about it out of class quite a bit, explained to me the 10,000 rule, which we both found thought provoking.

B0073LWEXK|4.0|I don't usually play these kinds of games, but thought I'd give it a try, since it is the free app of the day.  I'm really enjoying it. Not sure I'd be able to solve it without many glances at the hints, so I'm glad they are included!
B007MDB548|5.0|I love this movie, was amazing, watched it with my grand daughter and I felt just like a little kid
B002MG2RG0|5.0|awesome - it's a bonafide classic no doubt about it - a must have for any self respecting horror movie fan
B005LAII08|5.0|The story of Merida is very amazing, love it, fantasy looks so real, I enjoyed it very much and wish that they come out with another adventure of this Irish pricess princess
B009MO5G90|1.0|is this bluray 3d only or is it 2d.<br />will not buy it if 3d only and im a big fan of series and games.<br />and if in 3d only , WTF are they thinking about excluding their biggest fans who don't have that expensive 3d system???
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Not as good as the first one. Lots of action and humor that I enjoyed. Both main actors had solid performances
B00004VWA7|5.0|\\"Excellent record in its own right without a doubt. Even only living such a shortened lifespan, Jaco Pastorius (after hearing his name and samples of Portrait of Tracy from SWV and Wagon Christ) along with some assistance and experience from Weather Report has created an album not only mesmerising and eclectic but full of emotions that are just simple and complex to detect through the song titles. Full of variety, sonic environments, and a sense of geographic location that can be construed to have setted over in Middle Africa, South of the United States, and up north somewhere in New York or Pennsylvania. While this is not entirely the jazz genre, this is a fusion-based record that incorporates elements of blues, rock-and-roll, and world music into the sound. Immersive at the same time as well which if I repeat only just places much more of what is said from above. For new folks unknown to Pastorius, you will love this album in short if you do like Miles Davis' more experimental works, Squarepusher, and even Paul Hardcastle.\\"<br /><br />BEST SONGS: Okonole Y Trompa (as great and as calculating as mathematics and a great Eno-esque ambient song). Continuum (powerful, mellow, and quite scary in some ways). Portrait of Tracy (the most classic and most relaxing here on the list). Opus Pocus (quirky and offbeat just as how jazz is especially in New Orleans).
B0016BP0PW|3.0|All in all, a good way to introduce people to the Beatles. Long-time Beatles fans might love or hate it.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Without giving away the story I would encourage others to read this novel to learn about the way other women survive in a culture that doesn't support women's civil rights.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|The item was shipped quicker than expected. It came in just as it was explained I have no complaints at all.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Was great through the whole book and you'll love the surprise ending.  I liked it very much amd believe you will too.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Beautiful graphics on first two screens but thats as far as you get, game crashes after that on 8'9 Kindle Fire HD
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I got a new phone and forgot the name of this app so I tried a different one.  It wanted me to go to a web site to view weather alerts, what a pain.  I really like how the alerts are all integrated with this app.  Lots of options to adjust everything in this app.  Well worth the money.
0061474355|5.0|I love this book for two reasons.  The first is that it's really, really well done.  The second is that it introduced me to the work of Garth Nix, a true master storyteller.  Oftentimes you can tell what a writer's strengths (and possibly weaknesses) are pretty easily.  Some writers are clearly world builders, others are plotters, and some write characters who come alive on the page.  Nix does all these in Sabriel, and I've read enough to see that this is consistent with his writing in both short and long form.<br /><br />Sabriel has an amazingly well developed and cohesive fantasy world.  It's unlike any of the worlds I've read about in other books.  You'll clearly see Ancelstierre and The Old Kingdom, without the description slowing the story or bogging you down.  The undead of The Old Kingdom are nothing like the cliched zombies everywhere in modern media.  The magic system is also unique, interesting, and throughly developed. The characters are believable, interesting and appropriately flawed.  While some obviously fight for the side of life, and others fight for death, there are some whose alliances are not entirely clear.  I truly cared what happened to Sabriel, Touchstone and Mogget, and how the final confrontation would play out.  As an extra bonus, in Sabriel, we see a elegantly drawn strong female protagonist.  She has strength, power, and wit, but she's young and has a lot to learn.  We get to see her grow as she battles the undead and learns more about her homeland.  As a result, her final actions, which would have felt unrealistic for the character at the beginning, are believable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. Just think of it as a better version of Temple Run. Stop reading this and get it.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" (2012 release; 126 min.) brings the story of an Indian boy, named Piscine Patel, nicknamed Pi, as he grows up with his family on a zoo in India. Because of falling fortunes, Pi's dad decides to move the family to Canada, taking the animals of the zoo with them on their cross-Pacific Ocean journey with the idea to sell the animals upon arrival. Then disaster strikes as the ship meets a mega-storm and sinks. Pi manages to get on a life-saver boat, only to find that several animals made it onto the boat as well, a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan and a bengal tiger. To tell you more of what happens after that would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to find out and experience it for yourself.<br /><br />Several comments: the movie truly kicks into gear about 30 min. into it when the storm hits the ship transporting the family and the animals, with astounding visuals. The next hour of the movie finds Pi adrift on the Pacific Ocean with the several animals that somehow got onto the life-boat. At that point it reminded me of the Tom Hanks movie \\"Castaway\\" some years ago, albeit with one big exception: the visuals of the movie, in particularly when watching it in 3D as I did in the theatre today, are simply amazing. Eye-candy pure and simple. These days, 3D movies are rarely worth the bother, but this one is the beautiful exception, perhaps the best use of 3D since \\"Avatar\\".<br /><br />A shout-out to Suraj Sharma as the 16 yr. old Pi, who brings an outstanding performance, in particular since the many scenes he does with the bengal tiger, who is entirely CGI (although amazingly and incredibly looking real life). Also a special note to also to Mychael Danna who scored the beautiful soundtrack for the movie (it is available on CD). In all, I thorougly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I was amazed how quickly it rolled by. \\"Life of Pi\\" is one of those movies that needs to be seen on the big screen, and in 3D at that. \\"Life of Pi\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!NDED!
B009LK6JS2|1.0|horrable app waste oftime and effort will never order again does not work loaded me up with spam and all kinda stuff sorry nbut thats the truth !!!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I really love this group, awesome debut Album, enjoying every single song. &#34;Ho Hey&#34;, &#34;Stubborn Love&#34;, &#34;Flowers In Your Hair&#34;, &#34;Classy Girls&#34;, &#34;Big Parade&#34;, Etc.... I can't even tell which is my favorite song.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|this was the exact item I needed when I couldn't locate the one that came with my kindle. IT works!
B005LAIGLO|3.0|I caught this on cable last night and I'm puzzled by the poor notices. While it doesn't have the moodiness or verve of a truly great thriller, it is mostly a solid piece of work with some intriguing twists and good insider details on smuggling. Like \\"Lord of War\\" (which overlaps with this film in interesting ways) some people just seem to have a problem with the lead actor. I found it diverting and entertaining while it was on. The modern-art joke at the end was a nice surprise.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Third season is great!!  It keeps getting better and better with each turn.  The cliffhangers keep you wanting for more.  Looking forward to 4th season.
B009ANP48G|5.0|Love this installment of the Step Up movies! Even my teenaged sons & husband watched it & liked it. Great dancing - and non-stop action. Very good! I own the previous 3 and couldn't wait to add this one to my home collection after watching it at the theater. Definitely worth every penny spent! The plot was a bit cheesy and predictable, but along the same lines as the other ones. If you're a fan I believe you'll definitely like this one!
0061992860|5.0|The essentials with great pics and survival tips and ideas. Love the most commonly made mistakes which saves us from duplicating them. Wasn't a survivalist but now have confidence and fortitude.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|works great on original fire not so much on HD or the newer ones.I find it works just fine on original kindle fire to had for the new ones!! :D
B009UX2YAC|3.0|the reason I said its ok is because it is almost exatckly like templerun but I would say by this app.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game so much it may look childish but it os actually really fun you build your own town with all of the ponies pluss more and it os not like all of the rest were you just build. you acualy get to play games with the horses. it os simple and fun<br /><br />(gets kinda expensive though.)
B006LSZECO|4.0|All the twists and turns in this novel were amazing. It was a bit graphic at times (I'm also queasy when it comes to blood and sharp objects) but it was truly a fun read. The ending was a bit of a bummer and left me feeling like I didn't have any closure. So be prepared to be a bit bummed if you are someone who needs everything to be resolved at the end of a novel.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|I personally think this movie shouldve desereved the all-time Oscar, but atleast they got nominated and won one award. Above all its a great movie
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Excellent game, totally recommend it. The graphics are nice, and love the music while plying. haven't had any problems with it, keep my scores, doesn't freeze, works fantastic on my kindle fire
B009A9BF5G|5.0|This movie is a true inspiration for music lovers and those that are hard-core Coldplay fans. Coldplay is relatively the best band in the world to this day!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Really loved this one, actually enjoyed it even more then the original series. Riordan's knowledge of Mythology makes it so much more then a children's series. Especially loved hoe hr combined the Greek and Roman aspects. Excited to continue the story and see where it goes from here.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i mean you will love this game its better than any game i have ever played this game will rock your mind i love this game
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is really good! It's interesting and so much fun! Not to mention that the main character is so adorable! Get it!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is one of the best and most intense series in years.  It keeps you wanting to know what will happen next.
B009DKFSUA|4.0|I'd give this 5 stars but to me a 5 star rating means the album is an all time classic. This disc is fantastic, but not a classic... If the songs on this disc don't get you moving in your seat or dancing along at home than nothing will. Very good beats, good collaborations and just a good disc to listen to. There are a couple of weak songs but all in all this disc is a fun time. This is my first Pitbull disc and I was extremely happy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very exciting! Up and down but very exciting. Everyone should read this book! I think I may read it again. Great book!
B009SQRL4U|4.0|It was a silly and fun movie with a creative storyline. The kids enjoyed the flying animals. Something the whole family could enjoy.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|In the tradition of previous iterations, this is non stop light hearted action from the get-go.  Refusing to take itself too seriously, the show was a complete pleasure - I am not sure who had the most fun, the audience watching it, or the actors doing it.  Josh Brolin was superb as K, a strong addition to the cast.  The movie had the zaniness of Cohen and the fantasy delights of Spielberg. The surprise ending was the cherry on the cake, a great way to wrap the show, and (I hope not) the trypich. Yep, I liked it a lot.  Crankers
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good mother/daughter story with strong characters. The animation was amazing. It was a little scary at time for our 5 year old.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read!! It's a lot like 50 shades but better! Can't wait for the third book to come out! Happy girl here!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|i have this on my iphone and kindle and i challenge myself to beat my score on each one.  it's great!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I actually have the old movie on this, and the book, so was excited to compare them.  Different endings, but still good!  Would recommend it!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Muddy was the best. I also saw Lefty Dizz, sat in with his band and played his right handed guitar. I met Buddy Guy at the Checkerboard, and saw Junior Wells and the rollings tones many times. I started screaming like the Bears just won the Superbowl with a goal line stand when I started watching this video. There is a great moment in this video when Lefty is takin' a solo during a song Muddy is singin' and is gettin' ready to CLOWN and he points to himself and looks at Muddy as to say \\"Can I go another 12 ??\\" Muddy smiles, points to himself, and starts singing. I know Lefty had the ultimate respect for Muddy as did everyone. It still boggles my mind to this day that I never heard anyone ever say a bad thing about Muddy Waters 'cause all those guys loved to talk $h!t about everybody. Subtitles/closed caption was fun !! PLAY ON!!
B0063IH60K|1.0|I could only get this game to actually deal the cards so I could play it if I used the replay button. All that does is give you the same game again. It would not deal the cards if I tried any other selection. Would have been alright probably if not for that. I just couldn't play it, so I deleted it.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|This was a good movie, but it didn't move me like all of PIXAR's past movies.  Don't get me wrong, it is top notch.  I don't think those guys are capable of making a bad movie.  The plot just didn't seem quite as intuitive and heart-moving as I've come to expect and love from PIXAR movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The end was not what I was expecting, kept me on my toes the whole time.  The series was a nice quick read.
B009HELT3C|5.0|A little slower to develop than the first two, but worth the wait for the climax.  I usually rate a movie by whether I'd watch again, and I'd say I definitely would.
0698116496|5.0|This delightful little book won me over to the wordless book format.  It is useful practice for us parents to explain rather than just recite, and our 15-month-old loves pointing at pictures and asking what they are (her favorite word by far is &#34;that?&#34;).  It is one of her favorite books right now.
B009FZFONO|5.0|i have read the comics and watched every episode and by doing both, it has actually made the experience even better.  Don't feel like you can't do both without ruining the show, b/c they change many things and apply situations to different characters - so you have no idea who will live or die or lose limbs, etc, etc!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Love this movie. We adore the book and this movie lived up to the hype. Our three year old enjoys it and so do we!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I watched it twice, and I  can't wait to see part two.<br />I love the whole series, romantic, suspenseful and a great<br />special effects.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|God bless you, Jaycee, for having the courage to live through what you did and then stand up for yourself and tell your story. Great book, I appreciated the the courage it took to do this.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I downloaded this for our granddaughter. I coulden't figure out how to play it, but the kid was so involved with it she didn't have time to show grandpa how to play it.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|easy. memory training is little difficult on start but gets easier... math training is like a joke. third grader can do it..
B000001F45|5.0|What can I say , it sounds like it did the first time I heard it oh so many years ago.
0061474355|5.0|As the title states, one of the greatest fantasy books ever. It is interesting and unique. Many mysteries that need to be unveiled and many cool scenes of magic users (and a great system for magic!)Has a lot of great characters and many memorable scenes. Trust me, this review isn't going to do any justice. Buy the book and read it.
1401216676|5.0|this book is for anyone who loves the darker side of the joker, the gritty streets of gotham, and origin stories<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK!!!!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Yah yah I like it but the thing that sucks is for Angry birds star wars is I want to play both! and on seasons I want the the new update!!!! remember this rovio you owe ne updates !!!!!!!!! oh and kill the ads
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I love Breaking Bad!  How can you not?  The forth season is not a disappointment either.  Just get it and enjoy.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Sounds better on this live than any CD ive purchased.<br />Listen to it all the time.<br />Jm has a great voice
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It works great and is more reliable than the public power system.  I can set it to wake me to a nice song that gradually gets louder also.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|I love the off beat humor in this movie! It's creative, heart warming and funny. The cast is so good too!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I AM NOT PLEASED TO HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THIS TO USE THE CAMERA. IF I HAD KNOWN I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS KINDLE FIRE HD and yes I am SHOUTING!!!!!!!!!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I read a review that this novel was more like the original ones we loved so, but it too gets bogged down in psycho-babble and relationship squabbles with almost no suspense until the last few pages.  It's hard to figure why she lost her original talent, or maybe she just isn't trying as hard.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a ferry fun game and I reccomend it for every one but... my friend is a level 31 and yet this only gets to level15 I sold my level 15 to start over but will there be more levels?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|well its a time saver u know and when ur looking to do something later on it makes the time go really fast
B0001CNRBG|5.0|Had this movie in VHS so just had to order a DVD to make for more viewing options. Movie worth watching more than once.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|His fresh singer/songwriter sound has been missing from the recording industry for a while. It is nice to have it back.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I have not read this book yet but my wife and daughter both loved it as they did with hunger games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|is the best of the world,  you have to buy this amazing  amazing game 101 - in - 1 g a m e
075669812X|4.0|My child reads this book very frequently. He loves the characters and uses the book also as a reference and for gift requests of course.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Not at all what you would expect which makes it all the better.  I look forward to anything he writes and this one was no disappointment.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I hesitated a bit before deciding to read the book. It was not one of my priority reads but the hype got me curious. A good read.
1469984202|5.0|This was the best book I have read this year, and I agree that it will be a Science Fiction Classic. The premise is science fiction, the story is a study in social structures, and how man struggles to define and shape society. You will be enchanted, horrified, and still find hope at the end. The characters are engaging, the setting compresses their characteristics down to the essence, and one is drawn into their world where their work defines them as members in a society that falls apart when basic truths are questioned too deeply. I am reminded of Robert Heinlein's book, \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\" but with less comfort, and charm. This book makes you question the people who are in charge of any society, including our own. Reality is slowly peeled back,and we find the monster behind the mask is actually a joe trying to justify and do his odious job well-which is more disturbing than anything else that happens in the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My entire family read this book and we all gave it high scores. The movie, in our view, does not give full merit to the book.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's. so awesome to be able to &quot;interact&quot; with ponies and build your own Ponyville. As a free game, Gameloft makes its money by selling &quot;gems&quot; that can be used to get item that you want sooner, but with a lot of patience you can enjoy all the cuteness and gameplay for free.<br /><br />The interface for social interaction is quite buggy. You earn &quot;hearts&quot; for social interaction. These hearts are needed for certain items and ponies and can't be bought. But the social interaction prevents you from earning some hearts and completiong certain missions. The only way passed certain social missions is to use up precious gems that can sometimes take days to earn back.<br /><br />But social blunders aside, it's so fun to &quot;interact&quot; with the ponies and build your own Ponyville. A paid version that kids can play without the social component would be awesome.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Awesome, bought 3D version for my GF's 3D tv, it was amazing, just like being in the theater, I kept the reg. BluRay version, amazing sound and picture!
B003UESJH4|5.0|The packaging and sending of this product was good.  The quality off the merchandise was great too.  I like the movie, but wish they sold a pg13 version so my kids can see it.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Realistic characters with emotional attachments. I loved the friendships that developed in the story. I had a hard time putting the book down!!!! Great read!!
0385535147|5.0|I knew nothing about The Racketeer going in, other than its title and author, and that it's a legal type Grisham book (as opposed to the sentimental Grisham books, or his Theo Boone series).  This is a huge advantage to the reader, just to let you know.  So stop reading this, or any other, review on here and go read the book totally blind.  Trust me, I'm giving you good advice.<br /><br />For those of you sticking around:  Mal Bannister is a former lawyer and convicted racketeer (RICO), serving time in federal prison and counting down the days left (over five years).  That is, until a Federal judge is murdered, along with his mistress.  Bannister informs the FBI that he knows who did it, and will spill the beans in exchange for being let out, and a new life.  They go seemingly go along with the deal, and chaos proceeds to ensue.<br /><br />Bannister is the narrator for most of the story, and he's not the most reliable when it comes to telling us facts.  This makes him more interesting than the typical Grisham do-gooder lawyer in these books.  I was reminded of the main protagonist in The Associate, he's the guy we root for, but he's just sleazy enough that we wonder at his motives.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are the typical Grisham company of stock players:  The FBI guys, they mostly mean well but are so in the dark that they seem a bit clueless.....the cons, some of whom deserve their fates, others who are victims of the system........the love interest, who enjoys a spot of danger and is crucial to the plan.  I didn't mind the stock-ness of them, since most were at the mercy of Mal and his plan, which was just complicated enough to keep everyone guessing.<br /><br />This is two in a row for Grisham that I've really enjoyed (The Litigators too, The Confession didn't do much for me), in the legal thriller category anyway (the Theo Boone books are well written amusements), and I'm glad to see that he's still got \\"it\\".  Looking forward to next October already.<br /><br />Five stars.
B0093X805W|5.0|I recently purchased Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a read-aloud for a group of children grade1-5.  They are throughly enjoying it even though most have seen at least one of the movies.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|very good processor, In my opinion better buy than the i7 (anyone can disagree if they want), but i see a lot bigger jump between the i3 and this for the price than i do between this and the i7.<br /><br />\\"Windows Experiance Index\\"<br />puts it at a 7.6 subscore (based on calculations/sec)<br />this is on a scale from 1.0 (being the worst) to 7.9

B004HW7JH4|5.0|Viewers are anxiously awaiting the premiere of AMC's sixth season of the Emmy Award winning \\"Mad Men\\". This mesmerizing look into New York City's Madison Avenue advertising world in the early 1960's, and the dysfunctional lives behind the main players, has captured a large and loyal following. \\"Mad Men\\" fans can expect another great season from creator and director Matthew Weiner, as we follow the dramatic social changes of this era and its effects on Don Draper, his family, and the others at Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Pryce.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|An interesting plot but did not enjoy unnecessary abundance of smart ass  remarks. For every \\"laugh out loud\\" moment there were a dozen groans. Lead character John Corey did not endear himself to me. He is a \\" love him\\" or \\" hate him\\" kind of guy.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I rad the book before I saw the movie and the book is always better.  It was good but it didn't get me from the first chapter...

B004SBX112|1.0|I want my money back. I can't play this game. It keeps shuting off and going back to the home screen. Im sick of amazon when it comes to ANGRY BIRDS. Either the update is extremely late or I can't play it one the update is done. I WANT MY MONEY BACK
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend after I read Fifty..It was not as good but it was pretty close..
B00338QENI|5.0|An exceedingly well researched and written account of one of medical/biological science's greatest achievements.  The interplay between the hard science and human side of post slavery black culture makes it not only a fascinating read but an engaging look at American life.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a very funny & interesting book. Jeff Kiney and his books  are very funny. I love the books.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was amazing. Definitely one of my new favorites. Am looking forward to seeing what other books this author has available.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|This game is awsome but it starts over everytime i play please fix this i mean you pay $6.99 for this game and you cant even play it without it starting over!!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I play it constantly, very enjoyable and I good way to pass the time! my kids love it too and ask to play all the time.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan has outdone herself with this CD.  Her voice shines and it's clear she is in her element with the &#34;songs from the stage&#34;<br />Bravo!
B002BU0DPE|1.0|delivery was as expected. product is not a good choice, after two months the sounds didn't work anymore, come to find out that this product tend to be defected I will never buy a product like this.
B002NULL9E|5.0|If you are looking for a Queen collection in one CD, then get this. Not only is the sound quality astonishingly good, showing off the remarkable operatic talents of the band, the 20 track selections are mainly from Queen Greatest Hits 2, arguably the best of the Queen greatest hits albums - throw in Bohemian Rhapsody, You're my Best Friend, Killer Queen and Seven Seas of Rye and you have one pretty amazing CD and well worth the money.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|WOW very fast. Why should pay more for Core I7. This CPU offers wonderful performance and it´s to much cheaper than I7.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|These are great! My 2.5 year old loves these...and she will be getting more for her third birthday.  Great for building, imaginary play, counting ...fun, fun, fun.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|You get your moneys worth with this game.  Some levels can be very challeging.  The graphics are very well done.  Great for all ages.
B0037AGASG|5.0|I first experienced Justin Bieber on a road trip. Nothing else to do, I gave his tracks a listen. I found a new favorite artist for two or so years.<br /><br />With a few exceptions, the tracks on My World 2.0 are insanely well-done. \\"Baby\\" became a mega-hit for a reason: it's catchy and the lyrics remain smooth throughout. The interlude from Ludacris \\"Stuck in the Moment\\" expresses disappointment without falling into self-pity. It's actually mature and reflective. \\"U Smile\\" takes a different turn, toward soft and cutesy melodies.<br /><br />While Ludacris provides much of the strength for the first track, the album falls shorts when other collaborators enter the picture. Perhaps because their voices and personalities clash with Justin's, Jessica Jarrell and Sean Kingston take away from the impact of \\"Overboard\\" and \\"Eenie Meenie\\" respectively. \\"That Should Be Me\\" represents as much frustrated longing as a teenager can be expected to muster.<br /><br />This album is delightful. It's also a bittersweet collection, because I know his voice will never sound like this again, and his lyrics will never be so carefree. If you appreciate who Justin has become, it's time to find out how he got there.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I would like to start this review by saying that it's just an opinion. You may disagree with some things I have to say and you may not, but the important thing is that you remember reviews are opinionated, and if you really want to know if something is good or not, the only way to truly know is to judge it for yourself.<br /><br />That being said I think this is the best film I have ever seen. Yes, it has some continuity errors and a few other slight issues, but overall it is epic, inspiring, filled with action and driven by interesting characters who you can easily sympathise for. The length (about three hours) is only a testament to its overall strength and grand scale. It is believable and realistic, or as realistic as a Batman film can be. The look of it is brilliant, and it shows you a world that you don't quite want to leave. Whether you have entire boxes filled with DVD's that you still haven't figured out what to do with or you just like a good movie once in a while, its worth giving this film a good watch. I promise that at the least, its entertaining.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Titanic is my favorite movie. It's got everything I could ask for: an epic setting, an engrossing romance, and historical resonance. By now the basic outlines are clear to most people. Where the movie shines is in the execution of each scene. The drama builds continuously, even with the end result assured. Mr. Cameron deserves credit for pulling off such a weighty subject so powerfully. He also deserves recognition for paying respects to the historical reality. The model of the ship is quite accurate, with one room having been created from the original blueprints. (I learned that on one of the behind-the-scenes feature on this Blu-ray set.) This movie is well-deserving of its long runtime, because it accomplishes so much.<br /><br />I have been waiting for a high-definition version for years, and James Cameron took his time to release this copy. It's splendid. The extra features are entertaining. The documentary footage of the making of the movie humanizes its production, although it doesn't cast Mr. Cameron in a very flattering light. The movie itself looks brilliant at home. You have plenty of reasons to watch this again. Indeed, Titanic still blows away expectations.
0061122416|5.0|Each 2 years I read  this book. It's a classic, with a great message for your heart. A must read!
B0015AARJI|5.0|The Dualshock hasn't changed much from generation to generation, and with good reason. This controller works well.<br /><br />It's a functional controller - the buttons click pleasingly and consistently. It doesn't take too much effort to press them down; in fact, you can slide your finger across the surface to depress one of the buttons. My only gripe with the design is the groove that runs along the outer edge and is a magnet for dirt that can only be removed via a sheet of paper or other thin material.<br /><br />The design is clean and simple. It fits well in my hand. The elongated grips make it easy to hold for long periods of time, and even with one hand. The joypads have a slightly textured surface, which makes them easier to grip with the thumbs.<br /><br />I think the Sixaxis functionality is entirely unnecessary, and most developers seem to agree. It's not a feature that you generally have to deal with.<br /><br />This is a solid controller.
B008VBYN80|4.0|good little empire builder/turn based fighting game. you only get a handful of action points then you have to wait 3mins for each point or pay money for more. its just fine if you are looking to kill a few minutes at a time.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|This game is really nice, not boring like others make it seem. It's really a fun game, that has crazy hidden features that you don't know about! This game may not have a lot of &quot;madness&quot;, but it's a nice time-killer, and even not as a time killer, it's a fun game to play at any time! I don't know why, but i can't stay off of it cuz it's soo fun. Depending on the game, i may delete it after a few weeks. I had this for a few months, and it just doesn't get old! I, personally LOVE this game!! Most people with 1 stars don't know how to spell, so do not listen to those people!
0385536828|2.0|This is the first Ian McEwan book I've read and after all the hype, I am very disappointed. Didn't think any of charactors were very appealing, maybe Tom's interest in poetry was somewhat interesting. There was too much of Serena's detailed sex life that interfered with the shallow plot. All the \\"sweet tooth\\" planning at M15 seemed of little value to the world. I would not recommend this book;
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this game looks great and requires you to think alot. Tuff puzzles lead to more puzzles. Great way to kill time.  wonderful faotd
B0065GC0BA|3.0|This book is difficult to review. It is beautifully written and the characters and their love story are very believeable. The dynamics between Lou and Will are fantastic and the details of his life as a quadriplegic are fairly realistic, which is rare.<br /><br />But the ending is just terrible and depressing in an awful way. It`s not that I am totally against euthanasia/ helping someone to die. But in Will`s case, the injury that causes his disability happend less then 3 years ago. Less then 3 years is NOT a very long time to adapt after a life-changing event. And Will did not try for very long and wasted a lot of his 2,5 years as a quadriplegic wanting to die. I think helping someone to commit suicide who is still considered as \\"early out\\" and hasnt really tried to live is borderline murder. At the end of the book, Will has a lot to live for, and I totally don`t get why he is in such a rush to end his life and stay on his 6-month-schedule. You only have one life; delaying suicide to explore if maybe you dont want to die after all should be a serious option, right?<br />There is no reason why Will couldn`t go back to work (at least part-time), or why he couldn`t go back to London with Lou. There is no reason for someone with his money and education to waste his life watching daytime TV in a small town, paralyzed or not.<br /><br />I wish Jojo Moyes would have explored what he could still do with his life. But apparently, she was hell-bent on writing a book about euthanasia. Which is a wasted opportunity and sends a terrible message.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I really like this game. It quits every time I go in the store though- so I can't buy anything or access other characters. Games like this aren't fun for long if you can't keep upgrading. I'll probably delete and re-download but I'll lose everything I bought and my characters. I would rate it much higher without this issue.<br /><br />Update 12/25- (minus one star from earlier) OK, about a month ago I gave up and re-downloaded this game, erasing my past accomplishments but getting it moving again. Now, after I had fully upgraded jetpaks and coin magnets, after I was at a 23x multiplier, after everything was working fine,  the game simply UNINSTALLED from my kindle, and since it doesn't have gamecircle (I think, at least, that would protect in-game accomplishments/purchases) when I re-installed it was just at level 1, nothing bought, no coins built up.<br /><br />I'm kinda done, this sort of game is only fun if you can mod it some ongoing. It IS a good free game. It just may set you back at 0 when you least expect it.
B0091XRL86|3.0|I enjoy Wallace and Grommit and was hoping for some witty humor in this film that the adults would be able to enjoy while the kids enjoyed the overall film.  However, we were both slightly disappointed.  While we liked it, the kids said it was just okay.  The parents thought there should have been more witty banter in the dialogue.
0064471837|5.0|I picked this book up first when I was around eleven or twelve years old and found it while wandering through the public library. (At the time I had about a twelfth grade reading level.) I couldn't put it down. I have read it many, many times along with the other two books in the trilogy. Now that I'm currently studying for my MFA in Creative Writing, I haven't had much time for pleasure reading, yet the images in this book still come back to me immediately while I sit here typing this review, images of the bunny in the schoolyard near the opening, of Sabriel as she enters into death wielding bells, of Mogget, and her meeting with Prince Touchstone. This trilogy made its way into the small box of books I brought with me to college out of state. I hope to one day be able to publish books that leave such gripping images and characters that survive long after the reader has put the book down.

B002ZG9846|4.0|This movie was thoroughly entertaining and looks gorgeous on BluRay. Absolutely worth the money, especially considering the three copies you get.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I've never purchased anything by Rod Stewart, but I got it thanks to a gift card. I LOVE this album. His voice is amazing, the music is slightly jazzy, and the song choices are perfect. It's a GREAT album to put in the mix with all my other Christmas favorites.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app all the time to take notes on my kindle and my SGS3. I love how I can access my notes on any device I have and how easy it is to update the notes. I have not found any issues with the app so far even though I have bee using it for years.
0743277465|5.0|Day 9 made me do it.  This is an awesome book about an awesome human being living awesomely.  Quick, painless read, filled with lots of great anecdotes.
0345522478|5.0|I was reading the reviews and feel a bad for the people that scored this book low. This author has taken a marvelous topic and history and created something FUN!!!<br /><br />People forget that reading can be fun and OVER ANALYZE EVERYTHING. He says on the first page of this book that he wants you to enjoy this series. I laughed out loud many times and enjoy both the main character Atticus and his companion Oberon VERY MUCH. He created a great dynamic. The book was short and sweet and I finished it in 2 days. Can't wait to start the next!!!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Voting 1 star because it's too hard? Because a puzzle game is too challenging?  Come on people give me a break.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Our family has about 6-7 Christmas movies we watch every year, this was a great addition.  My ten year old got bored about half way through (he's never even seen a black & white movie), but my wife and I love it.  Touching story, great classic movie.
B0086449YA|5.0|Just what you'd expect from Mark Knopfler:  perfection.  Brings back your faith in music!  Just a fine studio recording.  Enjoy!
B000641D2Y|4.0|Nearly as good as the first one, just a classic Christmas movie the family watches every year.  My son has already seen this a few times but he still laughs at the physical comedy.  Only complaint I have was the aspect ratio of the movie itself.  It was listed as 1:85:1 widescreen which usually fills the entire screen on my HDTV with Bluray player, but for some reason this one had the bars on top and bottom (started out as bars around the entire picture, but got it to this with adjustments).
B001706I5I|5.0|Our family enjoys watching this movie every year. It helps bring in Christmas cheer and starts off the Christmas season.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This was my 4th favorite if the series.  I liked The Ugly Truth the best then Dig Days and then Cabin fever .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead never miss an episode we don't have cable so we buy it from amazon every monday night
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Kids were throughly glued to the movie.  I would certainly watch it again and again.  I recommended this movie for all familys.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it's the best game in the world.definately get this app 5star app for me.funny awesome definately for kids. please get this app.
B0091XRL86|4.0|I liked the movie and thought it was really cute.  The bird was probably my favorite part.  However, I felt it lack a bit of excitement to keep me and the kids interested.  I would recommend watching it though.
0811876373|5.0|kids love to make things like this  so my wife will like this cute little things to make with the children we have four
B007VUA7VO|5.0|best app tells how much time you have left before it dies and it shows you how much time to fully charge it.
B004IFYN2E|4.0|The Tourist is an amusing action movie with comedy, intrigue and a surprise ending.  I like the actors in almost every movie they have been in so I would guess if you are fan you will also enjoy this movie.
B0053O89IS|5.0|excellent season although it's shorter than usual. Still got all the favourite characters in it and although a slight cliffhanger ending, it ended well.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This movie is not for everyone, it has some personally offensive parts at the start (think bad step dad) and incorporates sci-fi, action, midevil and WWII scenes throughout the movie.  It is unusual, creative and has one of those plot's that keeps you guessing or wondering.  I have watched the movie 3-4 times and catch something new each time similar to The Matrix.  If you are a sci-fi fan or like the out of the box type movie you should enjoy this one.
B001IF252M|5.0|Works well with my tv, and I like the picture quality transferring movies from my laptop to the tv.  Thank you
B00785P2QC|4.0|Really like the game but a bit frustrating with all the prompts to post to facebook.  Hard to get enough invest points to progress but it is fun and keeps me wanting to come back to it.
B005IKZSYA|5.0|Warning:  there are subtitles, but this is nice little comedy about Papal intrigue and was filmed, it seems, largely in Rome.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is amazing. I read it in no time and have continue on to the rest of the series. It a great story told by a good author who tells multiple story lines but in a way that is not confusing to the reader.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|I chose to buy _The Windup Girl_ for my Kindle during a recent trip to New York to read while on the train, waiting in coffee shops, etc. based on the fact that it won the 2009 Nebula and tied for the 2010 Hugo awards for best novel. As a fan of well-written scifi, I'd never been disappointed picking reading from the list of award winners, and _The Windup Girl_ continued that trend.<br /><br />As an American, one of my favorite stylistic decisions that Bacigalupi made was setting the story in Bangkok and making it feel extremely foreign, even beyond the science fiction elements. The story is told from the viewpoints of 4 different characters, only one of which is native Thai, and trying to catch up on the nuances of some of the Thai words as well as understand some of the customs made it feel like this was a truly different world, even without all the changes in technology and economy. Furthermore, Bacigalupi didn't explain in detail what happened to change the world in 200 years - there was no chapter on the history and science. It was never clear exactly what had caused this new world of genetic modifications and rampant plagues, which led to a further sense of being outside my comfort zone. I think it was really effective in creating an atmosphere devoid of surety and confidence, which mimicked the precarious situations the characters found themselves in.<br /><br />I'm not always a huge fan of telling a story from different viewpoints, but in this case I found it effective and very interesting. Each character approached questions of survival and ethics differently, sometimes referencing cultural or religious beliefs that were different from the other characters' backgrounds. This particular device made Bacigalupi's vision of the future a lot easier to comprehend because the reader can see how different parts of society experience it. Additionally, I think it was very effective in showing that there is little absolute good and evil in the world as none of the characters are truly heroes or villains, except in the eyes of the other characters. This made it clear how different the cultural, political, and economic tensions play out without reading like a dull text book.<br /><br />(Mild spoiler alert)<br /><br />My biggest gripe with the book is the ending. I was looking for a resolution - either good or bad - of the relationship between two characters that just didn't happen when one died. At the end I thought a lot of the conflict hadn't be resolved, only put off until the players challenge each other again. This may be exactly what Bacigalupi was going for, an idea that some conflicts never resolve themselves easily and that life is one constant struggle. Regardless, it was emotionally unsatisfying.<br /><br />In short, I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it highly to anyone who likes science fiction or political intrigue. There are some very graphic descriptions of sexual abuse as well as a lot of violence and racism, so if you would prefer not to read those sorts of things (or have younger people read them), I'd recommend finding a different book to read.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book brings together many story lines and progresses them. The ending is great. Might be my favorite in the series so far, it is a toss up with the third book. Only problem I have with it is when I finished I wanted to read the next one. I cannot wait for the sixth book to come out.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|These days there seem to be new innovations to the Sherlock Holmes francise.  Thankfully, this movie follows a more classic take while being a thoroughly modern adaptation.  Well acted, well paced, and well written.  All in all, what's not to like?
B000PKX2KA|1.0|This gps unit has yet to work with any mapping program that I use.  I have no problem using Handheld units with laptop in vehichle using serial cable and adapters, but this fails all the time.
B002ZG98UK|4.0|The special effects are great in this movie, if you have a 3D TV I would definitely recommend this, very entertaining and visually stunning!
B0069UP2PI|2.0|It's like Ebola but better. A brilliant biologist and the CDC are working around the clock pretending to come up with a vaccine for the dying masses. They finally succeed but they're worried about getting the vaccine to the everyone on the planet. A Doctor says, &#34;Homeland Security wants to know if we can put a vaccination in the water supply, like Fluoride, cure everyone at once&#34;. Genius. Fluoride is a vitamin. Everyone knows that  At the end of the movie, they present a flow chart depicting how this genetically engineered virus spread to the masses. Shh children. Pay attention: A bat drops an infected piece of fruit eaten by a pig who was slaughtered by a butcher. The butcher gets Cooties then shakes hands with Gweneth Paltrow then Gweneth gives it to the guy she was having sex with in Chicago. She travels to Hong Kong and coughs on people there then goes home and gives it to Matt Damon. Like Batman, Damon has nice teeth and a great immune system so he doesn't die. At the end of the movie they play a song by Bono. A better movie is that one where they put Gweneth Paltrow's head in a box at the end.
1476719071|5.0|I've read this book over 5 times now and each time I reread it, I fall in love with the story all over again! Abby and Travis' love story is beautifully addictive! You can't help but fall in love with Travis, and Abby is a strong protagonist who you just want to root for. I seriously can't wait until Walking Disaster comes out! This is definitely my all time favorite love story!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|After reading many reviews on this Seiko, I was a bit leery, but I took a chance. Am I glad I did! Being a small frame guy, this watch is along the lines of the typical style and size I typically wear. This isn't my first Seiko, in fact, there are many. Which is why I insist on Seiko being on my wrist. Whether I'm elbow deep in grease, mud, rain, chainsaw chips or what ever I can throw at them, there is a Seiko in my collection that is up to the task. The Automatic has its place in the line up as one to be respected. It's not the bullet proof 7T32 Chronograph I first purchased 20 years ago (That is still going strong!), the 7T62 Chronograph (again, still performing flawlessly), nor is it the elegant 7N32 Quartz pearl dial that is more suited for Black Tie duty, but for a Respectable Urban work piece that goes well on the greens or at the office.....it's now a staple of my daily attire. Don't buy this watch if you are expecting a replacement to your Timex......You'll never buy another if you do! This is the least amount I have ever spent on any Seiko, but don't let that dissuade you from adding it to your collection. Finer pieces DO exist....as do lesser.  But it will equal the playing ground where other watches don't dare tread.
0425263908|5.0|After reading 50 shades,,,,, Everything else was BORING!!!  a co-worker recommended Sylvia,,,, ok, Let\\"s give it a try!! Well,... I found this BETTER then 50, i'm not done yet, cuz it is so good, i\\"m reading SLOW!!!!!  Don't want it to end!! This is better then TV!!!
B000002UCE|4.0|Maybe 3.5 stars because the good is fantastic, but some of the rest is anything but fantastic.<br />The title track is a true John Lennon classic which will stand the test of time for as long as music is played.<br />Crippled Inside is sung in a knockabout style, rather similar to The Band, but don't be fooled, there's a serious message underlying the cheerfully laidback presentation.<br />With Jealous Guy, well, I say forget about the Roxy Music version, this is the original and best by a mile.<br />Give Me Some Truth has excellent lyrics, but the guitars distort, making it harder to follow John's protest.<br />How Do You Sleep, a non veiled rage against Paul McCartney, also includes what I hear as untuneful sounds. However there's no doubting the message of vemon, it beats Bob Dylan's Positively Fourth Street for bad mouthing you're ex friends.<br />Oh My Love and Oh Yoko are love songs, so you can see this is an album of considerable contrasts.<br />I suggest you hear it and decide for yourself.
B009NOVCSS|4.0|I haven't even bought Grrr yet, and I may not because I already have copies of all of these songs.  Still, for someone who doesn't, it's an excellent introduction to the Rolling Stones catalog.  What I would like to see, though, is a CD of their greatest live hits, from Get Yer Ya Yas Out, Love You Live, and even the many bootlegs that are out there.  I am always disappointed when they play the studio version of Midnight Rambler instead of the 1969 live version from GYYO and Hot Rocks.  Even a CD that is entirely live Chuck Berry covers would be interesting.
0486474917|5.0|This is a real classic and it is an indispensable treasure to read such a talented author. The detective's sharp mind, nice and intelligent sense of humor, overall charisma and social skills are things to be highly respected. Last but not least, Dr. Watson is a character that is so appreciated and loved worldwide. The style is so natural and admirable. The reader feels deeply immersed into the plot. The author himself was an extraordinary gentleman, who always wanted to write something more 'serious', but life somehow did not of offer him such an opportunity. Nevertheless, Sherlock Holmes himself is quite a serious achievement in himself, which shall stay in our hearts.
B007V65R54|4.0|Required reading for any political junky that wants more Election 2012 coverage- not only was Silver right on the money with his NYT blog this cycle, he also accurately foreshadowed the mistakes made by the Romney team in terms of their polling analysis.

1608193381|5.0|This well written, easy to understand and highly entertaining book will revolutionize the way you think about capitalism and economic issues. It is the duty of every well informed citizen to question the received wisdom which those in power wish us to believe. Here is truth to power and money written so anyone can understand the issues. Read and become enlightened. For example, Professor Chang does an excellent job in explaining why immigration is an economic issue vital to all of us using the example of Ram and Sven, two bus drivers from India and Sweden respectively. If you are an engineer or a well paid financial guru, consider well why the Republicans in Congress recently created piece of so-called immigration \\"reform\\" legislation which only seeks to increase the number of work visas issued to highly skilled and highly educated engineers, scientists, and financial experts. Remember that supply and demand affect price - the price of your labor. If supply goes up, prices will go down. Just think about it.
B00979CS50|5.0|Psychedelic Pill.....is not a hard one to take!! Neil fires up the horse for an unforgettable set of great songs only they can do very well.Driftin' back kicks off the first side and is an interesting commentary on past and future trends,right up to &#34;gonna get a hip-hop haircut&#34;,and reference to poor quality MP3's.<br />Ramada Inn is one of my favourites,with it's telling look at modern day relationships....she does what she has too...he does what he needs to.<br />Twisted road gets side 2 off to a good up-tempo Twisted Road showing respect to his peers,Bob Dylan,and Roy Orbison.<br />And a moving tribute to his handicapped son,Ben,in For the love of Man.But for me another highlight is &#34;Walk like a Giant&#34;,....'in the face of failure,where there is love,thereis always hope'.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This was a good read.  I particularly like this period of history, which added to me giving it 4 stars.  I was pleasantly surprised at the twist at the end---which is always fun in a book
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun and free the way I like it!! Hoope to see more free games as time goes by. Keep up the good work!
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|I saw the concert - shook like a rhythmic leaf in the audience - and have enjoyed playing this album, weekly, loudly, for a few months. It's Metheny at his best, and he interplays different styles of jazz (frenetic avante garde to folksy blues and then back to straight-ahead jazz...) in a lovely, unifying kind of way. Strong performances across the board and a pleasure to listen. The damn album is blaring as I re-write my review, thinking that I short-changed a brilliant artist! But I love Metheny and this album! Personally, as a creative artist (relatively crappy keyboard jazz, cool photographic renderings), I relish his joy of live creation. So many celebrate simple cover work these days! THIS guy's the real deal: writing, exploring, rethinking, recreating... remarkable! Metheny has been at it for a long time. He's not milking his art, he's pushing it forward. To hear him explore his visions again is nothing short of pure joy (and was amazing to me as he went into it on-stage!). We need more artists like Pat Metheny, and I'm excited to own this fine album. Enthusiastic recommendation!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nicce way to play and watch  TV at the same time. Kindle handles this game beautifully.Glad I have it on Kindle for free.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Just what I expected. Good quality and I would recommend the purchase. Worth the price. Typical quality sold product for Amazon.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this game. It is fun to play and gives many different layouts. A nice way to keep your brain in tune!!
1579128955|1.0|This is an amazing book however i get it one star because i ordered the paperback version and it fell apart in less then one week! and i have seen my friends paperback versions do the same thing! I highly recommend the hardcover version! i bought the hardcover after the paperback fell apart and the hardcover has been great! Its just sad to see such a great book bound with such little quality! I give only one star because of my sadness about how low quality products have become these days........
B0086700CM|5.0|Thos game is the best game that I have ever played. This is the funniest and greatest game that I have ever played!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoy a good thriller, and this book goes above and beyond. The twists in this  book are a real head jerker!.If you enjoy a real surprise and shock in your books, then this one is for you.
B002PZJOCS|2.0|The biggest problem I have with the Mentalist is that I saw the Guardian first.  That show was superior in almost every respect to The Mentalist; cast chemistry, setting, acting skills of the guest actors, social relavance, even the wordrobes.  The show is as current today as it was when it aired and most of the cast characters are compelling and for the most part, believable.  Bakers performance and chemistry with his costars is amazing.<br />In contrast, I found the Mentalist to be another mediocre network show.  I am disapointed that Heller does not make use of Bakers mastery of non-verbal communication and body language.  Baker glides through the show chatty, smiling and flirty; odd when you think that he just lost his wife and child to a serial killer.  The supporting cast characters are flat, and do we really need another Cali cop show?<br />Considering the show has run for 5 seasons, I thought it would get more compelling, so I streamed a few episodes of Season 5.  It was like watching a soap opera. Nothing really changed, so I can't see spending almost $200 to buy all four seasons.  I can totally set this show aside.  Additionally, I found that numerous episodes are not HD, so why spend the extra money?
B00881VLCE|4.0|good for passing time....however it does become addictive if you like puzzles....only complaint is I wish there was more piecesbut over all I like it!
B009FXIICK|3.0|Zookeeper DX is yet another color matching game in the vein of Bejeweled or scores of other programs.  It's fun for a while, and a good time killer.
B003QSJVV2|5.0|I know this is not a review but, their is one song that plays through out the movie for instants it plays at 1:26:53?  If someone knows the song please let me know.  Thanks!!
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Rick Riordan has created a fantasy world that educates and entertains.  Isn't it great to be able to mention random Greek (and now Roman) gods in a conversation and know what you are talking about.  Bring on the rest!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the layout and how easy it is to move between scriptures.  But I dislike that I have to be link to the Internet to use the app.  I have not been able to create any highlights because it requires me to loving to facebook or twitter.  When I try to log in it States that facebook does not acknowledge. the account and gives me the option to create. I am a little concern to why this app seems to need all these additional things just so you could read the Bible.  If I find another app that's give the good points of this one without the problems I would quickly leave.  Besides I feel a little guilty having to have to turn on my wifi device just to use my favorite Bible in church.  Is there another way? (I use this app on the Kindle Fire).
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was amazing, very humorous, and I can't wait to see the movie but the book might be just a tad bit better.

B009VB97EY|1.0|What a waste of time and money.  Just a trash movie with big names dancing around naked.  Just go to a strip club instead if that is your thing.  There was no plot at all really just a lot of cheesy stripping.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This relatively expensive product did not last for more than 9 months with the silent switch cover starting to leak. Customer service promised me to replace the case but claimed they had not received the necessary details despite three emails containing the details. Big disappointment and not recommendable[[ASIN:B005WF9OHI LifeProof Case for iPhone 4/4S - Retail Packaging - Black]]
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I hate the way that we treat our elderly in this country. I wish that we revered them the way that they do in some countries.<br /><br />It's for that reason that this movie makes you wish it was real.  In The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, seven retirees, all struggling with their new identities as \\"old and useless,\\" decide to head to India based on the advertisement for the hotel.  What they find is not what they expected - the hotel isn't quite finished and it is not the lap of luxury for which some had hoped.  However, some do find ways to reinvent themselves.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this cast - Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton, Ronald Pickup, and Celia Imrie.  They remind us that life does not stop at 40 or 50 or even 60.  There are so many beautiful moments in this film.  And the younger set in the movie, Dev Patel and Tena Desae, are wonderful as well.<br /><br />Loved it and highly recommend it.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and I seldom buy movies to keep.  Not exactly like the comic, but hey, it's a movie.
B009E3EY38|5.0|To describe this concert in just one word: The Heaviest Metal Concert ever in DVD and CD. Led Zeppelin is still the greatest band, The Celebration Day Package is just amazing. Jimmy Page is still the best guitar player ever. Robert Plant's voice even though a little low than previous years still Rocking and Rolling, John Paul Jones still the bass player around and what can I say about Jason Bonham just like his Dad John ( Bonzo ) clearly stepped into his shoes.Jason played a thunderous finish with Rock and Roll. All in All the Celebration Day package is worth every dollar from my pocket. I have been a fan of Led Zeppelin since my days from high school living in NY city.<br />I really recommend it. Enjoy it. Led Zeppelin forever.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|Good album, The songs with her co-stars on The Voice are great to listen to, I wish she would have done one with Adam also.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Smoking hot jazz singing. It's worth the cost just for \\"Midnight Man\\", the 1st track. I'm a life long fan of Renee Olstead after buying this cd. Beautiful voice and great production and sound. Excellent cd.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|This is ONE of there best, you choose which is best, we could argue forever about this and nobody is wrong- Train is GREAT!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is an awesoem fun game to play and is very very adicting. you can play this game forever and not get bored of it. I recommend this game to all of you.
B008J34466|4.0|Pink has never dissappointed me with her music, This is another HIT to add to your Pink collection that won't dissappoint Pink fans.
B009DKCBM8|5.0|This latest album with Neil Young and his old band mates Crazy Horse consist of a nice blend of new songs.  Young's singing is spare on most tracks.  This is a musician heavy album with some very long jams.  It's all good.<br /><br />I bought this album on Blu ray, but was suprised to see that there is no \\"surround\\" option.  Audio option 2 is the only option.  I wonder what happened to option 1?  In any case, the audio is excellent in the lossless linear PCM stereo format.  The Blu ray also comes with some video enhancements which include some choice scenes from old, even silent, movies.  The ones that accompany the title track and \\"She's Always Dancing\\" are the best.<br /><br />There are also muted clips of videos of The Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison.  Other videos include some home movies and just visuals of a kaleidoscope.  The bonus tracks include a couple shortened mixes of \\"Psychedelic Pill\\" and a 37 minute jam called \\"Horse Back\\" which includes the photographer (probably Young) meandering around the sound studio patiently showing instruments, power cords, hand written lyrics, mics, control panels, etc.  It's very cool.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I've been a Aerosmith fan since there beginning in 1973 with &#34;GET YOUR WINGS&#34;. I think I have all of there albums and cd's. I had to listen to this 3 times before I could decide if I really liked it. It's good but I think this is there LAST album. This is the ONLY band in the world in any field of music to be together for 40 years with the original members, that says it all about AEROSMITH!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It is an easy and interesting way to get to know more about a very important period in history. A good book for those who like a story approach to history.
B008G59IKO|4.0|I liked this the first time I listened to it, fast tempo and more rock than Uno, but I like both of them.
1400052181|5.0|The book was in great condition and is a really interesting read. I would definetly recommend you read this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is great.  great..... great it is GREAT I oust love it... wut more is there to say???? I mean rlly?
B005LAII08|2.0|This is a movie about bashing little boys. Some producers have decided to deviate from the traditional girl finds prince scenario. That scenario, is really what makes a great film. What they did in Brave, is attack and undermine little boys. If you are an adult and can see through the political correctness amuck then watch it. Please do not let impressionable children see it. It will give the message that boys are inferior goofs.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with a young girl dreaming of finding her perfect soul mate (prince) in life.<br />Unfortunately, a few bitter and angry woman want to take this away.<br /><br />I saw the film at a friens home. I would personally not contribute finacially to this cause. Send a message by not buying films like this
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|game is fun!  I don't like having to change players so the game can be played again.  My granddaughters play the game now.  Needs to be more of a challenge.  I paid once and will not pay for upgrades and will not give access to my account.
B001FD5KJM|4.0|Not a movie to win best picture or make you think, but a good movie to sit back and enjoy.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked it just didnt love it.  I LOVED the first book.  This book is a little too up and down and some details didnt get an explanation that satisfied me in the end... (I won't ruin it for anyone, but some will know what I mean).  I was left with, \\"but that doesnt explain why...blah blah blah... I hope the third is much better.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|this stylus has a great weight, and writes very well. i'm very, very happy with it. the packaging has changed, it is now in a little tube, which is nice for transport between uses.
0920668372|5.0|Each time I read this book my eyes well up. Simply said I loved this book. I bought this for my two daughters who have recently given birth to their first child. I think this is more appropriate for parents to give to their adult chilren rather then for youngsters. That said, now that my daughters are parents they can understand the love a mother feels for her children no matter how old they are \\"As long I'm living my baby you'll be.\\"
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|best app in the world you people should really try it it has power ups and many vehicles that give you boosts
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Wish I had read this book years ago, wonderful insights  for introverts and those wishing to understand and support these quieter souls.
B001EBWING|5.0|Always great to watch a classic!Especially Bogart. Highly recommend for anyone who likes Bogart and loves old movies in black and white digitaly refurbished.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|just like the other reviews. it kicked me out after the second screen. it was the free app of the day  so no $ lost
B0089ZEEYG|1.0|I have not played this game much. I really don't know how to play it.<br />Needs more instructions. Maybe I will try again.
0345525558|5.0|As beautiful as the title is the content !!  Very refresh lecture that captured your attention since the beginning to the end..
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This movie is a must see for everyone of all ages. My kids really loved this movie and they watched it for 3 days straight. If it's kid approved then I approve...
0061474355|5.0|Sabriel was my gateway into the fantasy genre... and recreational reading in general. Until I friend lovingly forced this book upon me, I had only viewed reading as something to be done as schoolwork.<br /><br />Not only did it grip my morbid imagination by dealing with necromancy, it also piqued my interest in gender roles. This isn't the stereotypical prince-saves-princess book. Instead, you have a fairly clueless (yet strong) female accidentally saving the prince and reluctantly bringing him along. I have since gone on to read countless other recrational books, but none have gone on to break the stereotyped gender roles as Sabriel has.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Had to read this book simply because it's John Grisham. Another good read with nice twists and turns throughout. Can't wait until he has another one come out
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Delivered on time for something high in demand, and a great action movie for those who love alpha male action.<br /><br />Thor = Traditional Alpha male (Aggressive, mentally tough, physically strong, tall, and honorable).<br /><br />Captain America = World War 2 alpha male (Mature, mentally tough, noble, and a natural born leader).<br /><br />Incredible Hulk = 1970s alpha male (Smartest in his profession, biggest muscles, and the strongest around).<br /><br />Ironman  = Modern day alpha male (A witty leader, the most intelligent man in any room he walks into, successful at anything he sets his mind to work at, and a playboy billionaire).
141659521X|5.0|As usual, another great Flynn book with my favorite hunk Mitch Rapp. I could not put this book down. I was trying to read a few pages a day because I did not want it to end and wait for another book to come out. I cannot get enough of this man. I read everyone of his books in order non-stop. The most exciting author of all time. Keep them coming Vince.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie<br />Great action<br />I loved it<br />I thought this was an exciting movie. I wish Spiderman was in this movie. Maybe he will be in the sequel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it its so much fun on car rides execilly long ones i love it so much i cant explanin iT
B003UESJHO|5.0|One of my favorite movies! I could watch this movie over and over again.  The story is great, the acting is even better!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Every time these books come out I devour them. I anxiously wait for the newest book in the series and each time I  am just as thrilled as I was the book before!  I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys mythology and adventure!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|. . . . . . . . love it better then temple run. . . . . . . .
B001CB8NQE|5.0|This series is awesome. It's like the next chapter if the original stargate sg-1 series. I only wish it hasn't been canceled due to pricing. Apparently it was too expensive to film each episode.
B0091REZMW|4.0|game good with the exception of a few glitches.  Codes never work and I paid for diamonds and never recvd but otherwise good.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Simply wonderful! Lana's voice is hauntingly beautiful. The album is one that you simply start and dont stop until its over. Every song is mesmerizing.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|Not your typical game.  Journey like the other titles included (Flower and  Flow) are experiences and not so much games.  There are things that need to be accomplished within each one but it is divergent from the mainstream.<br /><br />Journey has you traveling across a desert collecting &#34;ribbons&#34; which allow your character to jump farther and reach passages or paths in order to get to a final gate/portal.  The games starts slow but gets more challenging along the way.  Since your character does not have weapons(none at the point to which I have played), it will be more of a strategic/puzzler.  It will may you think.<br /><br />Flower is a whimsical experience.  You basically &#34;fly&#34; around a field in first person view making flower buds blossom.  It's not so much a thinker but a relaxer.  Utilizing the SIXAXIS controller's motion tilt feature, it's real easy to play and actually becomes quite relaxing.  Very beautiful renderings help make it enjoyable.<br /><br />Flow is simply eat or be eaten.  I guess a worm would be a fit description for what you are and you have to &#34;absorb&#34; or eat little plankton like things in your surrounding area.  You can move to new areas or return to old ones using portals but the further you go, the more difficult it becomes to survive.  This game also uses the SIXAXIS motion tilt feature and the controls are a little vexing. Other than that it is playable but can become frustrating due to the controls.<br /><br />I like Journey as a puzzler, I am fond of Flower for it's ZEN like feel, and Flow is okay.
1608862801|4.0|I'm not the biggest Adventure Time fan alive, but I really enjoy the show. This comic maintains a lot of the charm of the series. A little something feels lost in the transition (perhaps I'm just missing the stellar voice cast) but this collection of random adventures is entertaining and funny. I like see the variant covers and the various artist's take on the characters.
0545425115|5.0|I just bought 4 copies of this for my classroom because it was so cheap. The page numbers match up with the original addition and the only change I have noticed is the cover. Great deal for an amazing book, even if you are trying to add to a set that you already have. This probably only matters for teachers.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Great movie. Plenty of action, good story line. These are the action actors I grew up with and they are better now than before!!
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book and I lent it to my sister and my mother.  My sister said she liked it also, btut thought that the title was horrible and likely would not have picked up the book based on the title.  Once she said that l realized I couldn't remember the name of the book only the author's name so I would have to agree the title is probably not a great one
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Nothing bad to say at all here. This movie was awesome. The hulk and Thor were incredible. Really funny too!
B004YOEFG8|5.0|This documentary has gone well beyond my expetations. This amazing effort on the universes and information provided by the narration was truly unbelievable. The colur,  galaxies and the superb photography  is vision beyond the stars as we know. The vast universe makes us on earth look so small. I have seen this movie many times and shall continue view it and encourage my friends to also enjoy it. I am looking forward to a sequel to this. This truly is one of the most amazing documenatries I have seen. This work is amazing! An  excellent documentary forevry student, from primary to university and beyond!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game - cool effects.  Got it for everyone in my family!  Perfect for Star Wars fans and Angry Birds fans
B000000OE7|5.0|Frankly, this album is a snapshot of the final days of Queen with Freddie Mercury.<br />Freddie had known, presumably sometime after The Magic tour, if not briefly before(captured best in[[ASIN:B00009P1O2 Queen - Live at Wembley Stadium]] and[[ASIN:B009DH371K Hungarian Rhapsody: Queen Live in Budapest [Blu-ray/2CD]]])  that he was ill with HIV, and later AIDS, to which he would succumb in 1991.<br /><br />This album, like the previous[[ASIN:B000000OA6 Innuendo]] has a sense of urgency to it, an urgency borne by the band knowing Freddie was on borrowed time.  The songs, though as noted elsewhere are not all new compositions, all tie into an overreaching theme.  One of acceptance of what's coming, mixed with peace and a glimmer of hope, that maybe, just maybe....<br />The last vocals ever recorded by Freddie are found in the second verse of \\"Mother Love\\" which Brian may had to complete. \\"A winter's Tale\\" is Freddie's last composition<br />Gone is the pomp and camp, here we see four friends who had been making music together twenty years, giving it all a proper send off<br />There has been talk of one last release of Mercury rarities due within the next few years, but even with that, this is a fitting end note.  If you didn't like the earlier Queen, try the 80s releases (skip Hot Space, my personal thoughts apply here) and the above mentioned products<br /><br />When a talent leaves us too soon, there is always the \\"what if\\" element but this proves that, to his last breath, Freddie truly had \\"A kind of magic\\"
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This was a fun movie but not for small children in my opinion. Like Sherk which I love it has some adult/potty humor. Also the witch may be a bit scary to little ones. Other than those two issues I like the story that people should be able to choose whom to love and marry. I like that it stars a young woman/girl who stands up for what she believes in. It also teaches you to be careful for what you wish for as it may not turn out as you want it to.<br /><br />The animation is as usual great, it is fast paced and I never got bored. Recommend.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is fun, new items all the time, I have the app on my phone and kindle fire, So now I can Pinterest all the time.
B004D38HOG|5.0|Couldn't put this book down!  A lot of women struggle so much to find self worth outside of our appearance and weight.  I appreciate the amazing, open and honest way this book was written, laid bare!  Thank you
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is really great. I spend such a long time playing it and its totally free which makes it even better.
B0083EW97W|5.0|It's been quite a while since I've purchased a full album and I'm ashamed to say so. Born and raised has made me realize what I've been missing and I love everything John Mayer does. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love this game whoever doesn't have it is crazy this is the best game in the world. so people you need to buy this game
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great movie!! I enjoyed it as much as my grandson. Lots of actions, laughs - the whole works!! Very entertaining.. Patiently waiting for Avengers II...

B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This cartoon was NOT what I expected. I enjoyed the plot twist. Great mom/child lesson. I will suggest you turn on the subtitles - the accents are a bit heavy. Also a good movie to teach obedience, respect, and forgiveness.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|best feature is that i can actually seethe numbers and i don'thave to call weather bug<br />. my son is also learnig to tell time so this is great for him
B004GXKBFQ|4.0|I already have the DVD widescreen and have recently bought the Blu-Ray version.  Thinking that I had just upgraded from the original DVD version, I found myself very disappointed when l soon realized that there were NO BONUS FEATURES on the Blu-Ray version.  I should have read the product details.  It had never occured to me that the Bonus features would be omitted.  Don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray version, only a few scenes in the movie appear a little crisper, such as the fairy dance in the forest where Peter and Wendy are dancing in the moonlight.  When using a Blu-Ray player with the DVD widescreen version, the rest of the movie does not look any better.  The DVD version already has excellent video quality.<br /><br />Otherwise this movie deserves 5 stars.  Jason Isaacs and Jeremy Sumpter are incredible actors, the emotions are really there!  In addition to the beautiful Olivia Williams who plays Mrs Darling, all the actors were great. Most of all however, we were really amazed that Jeremy Sumpter, a child actor at 12/13 years old during production, had learned to fight with a sword, fly with a harness and make it look real, do 98% of the stunts himself and acted in such a convincing way that you really believed that he was the real Peter Pan.  There is so much depth to this Peter Pan, the boy that would not grow up, that in some scenes, Jeremy really tugs at your heart-strings.  Credit should go to the casting director for finding such a gifted boy.  In my view he is forever immortalized as the real Peter Pan.<br /><br />This movie is not like all the bland versions of Peter Pan.  It is definitely the best adaptation of the original book by J.M. Barrie that I have ever seen, I just wish that I would have seen it on the silver screen in 2003.  For parents out there, it's not just another kiddy movie, there are dark scenes, quite a bit of humor and unfortunately a bitter-sweet ending.  Both children and adults will enjoy this movie.  My kids watched it at least a dozen times on DVD and of course we watched it recently in this Blu-Ray version.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I recommend that you buy the DVD Widescreen version instead, I guarantee that you will get more for your money.  All the bonus features on the DVD version are really good.  The Bonus features will give you the opportunity to further appreciate the hard work and dedication that went into the making of this wonderous movie.
B0016BP0PW|4.0|this movie is great especially growing up n that era I admit there were some parts that. dragged on but for the most part just stick to the music and you'll stay involved
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is one of the best suspense novels I have ever read.  You cannot put it down.  The heroine is both believable, likeable, and so easy to identify with.  I will anxiously await the next book from this author.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book, as well as all other Vince Flynn titles! All Mr. Flynn's stories are topical and well put together.  A great read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Although I was left feeling slightly disturbed by this book, I have to give it 5 stars for the superbly written storyline.  The book became an especially gripping, can't wait to find out, page turning story, particularly in the second half.  I would recommend reading.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|what can I say, downloaded and installed smoothly. I opened to the menu screen plus 2 more, then booted back to the carosel. Just doesnt work. Very disappointed with Amazon lately :-(
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game is a trilling adventure. especially for those people who like mysteries! works great on my kindle fire too!
B005LAIIS0|3.0|It's interesting to me that a movie can have over 100 5 star reviews, and an equal if not more 1 star review.  Personally I enjoyed it.  For those of you reviewers who actually took the time and effort to write in &#34;wolves don't act like that, and etc. etc. etc&#34;', gimme a break.  I suppose you're the same people that waste our time arguing that a Great White Shark would NEVER leap out of the water onto a boat or chew on an oxygen tank.  3 words.  &#34;It's a movie!&#34;  Entertainment.  It's not a documentary on the habits of wolves in the frozen wastelands of Alaska.  Watch a PBS special for that.  The acting was awesome and I thought the ending was spectacular.  Very bold on the directors part.  You either loved it or hated it.  All I can say is, most people I've spoken to enjoyed it.  While it's definitely not a 5 star flick like the aforementioned Jaws, it at least deserved 3.
1419705849|5.0|My 10 year old son is generally a reluctant reader but loves this series. He read this book in one day without any pushing from me. I love that this book and this series makes him want to read.

B0084I9QI2|5.0|I love the Bad 25th I love the CDs and DVD inside, It's awesome If you love Michael Jackson ❤
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie is good to watch and my wife and teenage son enjoyed it more than me because they read the books.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Johnny Depp is in the movie - really?  Yep - his acting is sooooo terrific that he's different every show - he's the character not the actor - Dark Shadows is great fun - loved by all ages.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Really lame movie.  Great music is the only reason I watched it as long as I did. Don't waste your money.
B004EPYZQ2|1.0|The Blu-Ray itself is fine. I am looking to get my digital copy though! The one sent with the Blu-Ray is already redeemed and expired.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This has always been a favorite in my home. I could watch this movie over and over again. Very Happy
B0053O89IS|4.0|I was concerned this season would lose some of It's flavor with Booth and Brennan as a couple, as well as parents; though we all longed to see this day... However I was not at all let down by the episodes in season 7. Therebwas romance, mystery, comedy, and reality in Bones/ Booth and Angela/Jack sneaking the babies in to the lab.  I enjoyed being angry with Bones for leaving Booth at the finale!! While understanding it was likely the best decision. Not having seen ANY of the Season 8 Episodes, for want of viewing all of Season 7, before watching even one in Season 8: I anxiously awaited, discovering the outcome of Bones on the run, Booth without his family, and Angela defending her best friend against all odds! It was fantastic!!!! My only reason for giving season 7 a four of five stars, is because there were far too few episodes this time. I'm use to twice as many. Since Emily was ACTUALLY PREGNANT, and likely had leave of absence for maternal reasons, I completely understand: and therefore give 4 3/4 stars for Bones Season 7!.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. My only complaint is it was over so fast. It only took me a few hours to finish it. More of grandma's adventures would b a great addition!  The graphics on my galaxy S 3 were great. I havent had this phone long so it was nice to see what it could do!
B003Z0D4SM|5.0|A complicated but spellbinding story. Hard to get started but then couldn't  put it down<br />Loved it<br />Had the paperback but wanted to download to IPad
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|When I was young, I watched this movie a couple of times.  I never really got it.  I didn't realize that then, but after watching it again now, I know that I was ignorant to the brilliance of this movie.
B0098460O4|5.0|Pavarotti is looking down from Heaven and smiling. What an amazing voice and what an incredible gift he has to offer to the world of opera, as well as popular music. I look forward to hearing about his future and the impact he will make. Excellent CD.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|didnt work set the alarm and it never rang luckily i woke up in time but am very am overall disappointed with it.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I honestly had no idea Phillip Phillips was connected to American Idol in any way...I first saw him performing \\"Home\\" on the Ellen Show and I just fell in love with his voice and the song and his singing style. I didn't know he was from American Idol until AFTER I bought the album and I saw something on tv about it, so I had no previous connection with him, and had only watched him perform once, and had no idea what his style was like. That being said, I just love love love this album. I love how upbeat the songs are without being pop-y, I love the emotion in his voice, the SOUND of his voice, it is just so different and fantastic, and I love the background music of the songs, lots of orchestra in the background, whether it be strings, drums, whatever. The album is just really good. And I love ALL of it, every song, and I did from the very first listen. That never happens for me, even when I'm listening to a new album of my very favorite artist. GET THIS ALBUM IT'S GREAT I PROMISE! =)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I wanted a game that reminded me of how I felt playing King's Quest growing up. This is it! Great (if somewhat predictable) story line, well-crafted controls that don't interfere with game play, and a beautiful, spooky environment! Puzzles and story action are nicely paced and proportioned. Also, I liked that the puzzles were varied and of moderate difficulty. The only negative: I wanted it to be longer! Oh, and a plot twist or two would be fun! Please make more like this!
0525423281|3.0|Okay, first off, I haven't read Anna&The French Kiss. My librarian had me read this book, assuring I would like it. I  found that she was wrong. I love Lola's personality, but I could NOT get past the beginning. I was 100 pages in and the book was tediously long and repetitive. It wasn't a book that I wanted to finish. I had a growing mount of other books to read, and this book didn't make me want to keep reading. I would recommend this to someone who wants a quick read, with a lot of redundancy. This author has potiental--this just wasn't  up to par.
141659521X|5.0|A safe house with four men lined up on the living room floor. There was nothing about this mess to give Mitch Rapp any kind of assurance that things would be fine, but it gave him an inkling to something he did not want to consider. The safe house looked like an average run of the mill two-story blockhouse in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. So what happened? Rapp's boss, Irene Kennedy sent him to Afghanistan to find Joe Rickman, the most cunning and brilliant operative he had ever worked with. Was the CIA operative going to have to find and eliminate Rickman - someone he had known for over 16 years. You can bet Rapp is not the only one looking for Rickman.Rapp knows sooner or later Congress would get wind of the disaster and they would want answers.<br />What a bright and intellectual author Vince Flynn is. I love how he creates his characters and brings them to life or kills them off. Mitch Rapp reminds me of the Rambo character that Sylvester Stallone plays so well in the movies. He is human with deep feelings, especially for his friends.<br />I am not one to give away spoilers, but can Rapp be as ruthless and underhanded as his hostile and sinister adversaries and complete his mission? I will say Vince Flynn has the knack of writing unpredictable and very moving novels. I think any reader who likes mysteries will like this one. Kudos Vince! You have another great book to take credit for.<br /><br />Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author of \\"Fighting the Devil\\" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Lots of action, decent plot points..and over all everything it should be. Some interesting camieos and over all lots and lots of action.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|A definite must see.Good story,great action.Hugh Jackman is always pretty good,but he was at his best in this one.It was the kid in the movie who really put in a stellar performance.Nerd Nirvana.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I bought this last Christmas and just pulled it out again as we put our tree up this year. What a great Christmas album! This has become my new favorite. So many Christmas CD's sound generic and interchangeable, but his really has that special something. My kids like it and even my husband who isn't into Christmas music thinks it sounds good. If you don't have this album, and especially if you like Michael Bublé, you've got to get it. You won't be disappointed.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|no glitches or anything on the kindle fire! its absolutely wonderful! xoxo xoxo xoxo  mlp! I play it everydayy!  hfhdjdjfbdjj dhdjdj fhdjsj fhdjd fhfub
B005PW3OS8|1.0|The only thing I liked about this film were the end credits. What a dull mess of a film, with the blandest characters ever.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I saw the live show when they were in Seattle.  It's really nice to have a memento like this to remember it by.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It lives up to they hype.  Showed extremely fast.  whats more the UV light works great with black light posters and even one of my friends black light tattoo.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|pretty good time consumer daughter loves it but she needs some help navigating some of the screens. some variety of minigames would be an improvement.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|I like the app, but why force us to useyour app instead of the normal gallery to view the photos? that's annoying and dumb.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoy all of Nicholas Sparks books.  I like the romance in his books, but there is usually some intigue as well.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I wish u could change the tile selection for a variety of play. I don't really like just being able to use the traditional tile theme.
B002AS463W|5.0|Liked the movie and definately has romance and mystery.  Like the characters and recommend for those with a playful side.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game its fun awesome I will never delete this never ever true its fun when new ponies come to the village I can not wait till all the pony's r there and all the pretty things and I hope pinky pie comes
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is an easy fun game to play.  It has a lot of different screens to work through as you progress and you have to work at it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|As soon as you figure out how to navigate, you wont want to put this game down. Even more, its got a built in spoiler section!
B004V5A7K8|1.0|I actually put this app on for my son to play with but have used it also.  It just didi not keep your interest for long.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun &amp; Fabulous!  I can't find a better way to be creative and pass the time!  Garden of Eden revisitted!
0060245867|3.0|I really like the older children's books but several friends were raving about these types of books.  There are several in the series.  Maybe I;m not the best one to rate since I am from an older generation.
B005HSL626|4.0|It's really fast for old fingers...but grandson who is 5 yrs old loves it. I don't write many reviews because of the pain in the butt &#34;tips and guidelines&#34;!
0812971825|4.0|It is a good book, but a sad story about grief and loss.  I read it because it was on my book club's list. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a story of a church ministry in a small town.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|I purchased this app based on all the high ranked reviews. I won't do that again.<br /><br />this app seems to have a lot of potential, but it can't even take more than one screen of text. And it won't continue text from one text box to a new one on a new page. In other words,  don't expect to use this for more than very short notes. I was hoping to use this as a journal app, there's no way it will work for that.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this as many stars as I did was due to the freedom of layout one has.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|It was awesome. Have enjoyed listin to it. I would buy more items. It came on time, and have been very happy.
B0015KO52S|2.0|Better than their other album, but lacks much of the good Jack White and/or the White Stripes. Only found two tracks worthy of keeping--Hold Up and Salute Your Solutuon.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|To me this is one the most amazing heavy metal albums<br />I own. The fact that musicians from different bands who had probably never played together,<br />played together on brand new material and recorded there parts only one to two days<br />after hearing the song for the first time.
B001AP11KW|1.0|Huge Jack White and White Stripes fan, but this has nothing worthy of discussing. Their other album would be a better choice to start with.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|great cd,I've liked Joe Walsh since I was friends with his bass player at Kent State back in the late 60's This cd is not a dissapointment, it classic Joe Walsh, if you like Joe, you'll love this cd.
B00001NTXN|3.0|It seems the best of these newer type, original games. Best if played with four, as opposed to two, people.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Enjoyable and stood book for anyone who likes to laugh. But it is very easy and I blew through it in like an hour
B009CGYO0K|1.0|Really didn't like the book. It was slow and boring. Not very funny. Some parts were good but far and few between.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great app for the Kindle. I love tge way you can go back and look at past calculations and change them if needed.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Be prepared. You will be on the edge of your seat for this one. I couldn't put it down...My daughter and I read it both and were astonished by how captivating it was.
B003O86FMW|5.0|catching fire is signifially amazing! Even more complex  and interestly outragest!! Completely amazing and emotional. Very good book and recogmended to read
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Truly a porn on paper but the other two are amazing full of suspense, romantic, and all around tear jerkers. I really wish there were more to read.
0307596885|5.0|Every time I think that Alice Munro simply can't get any better, her next short story collection comes out and she astounds me all over again.<br /><br />This is a writer who possesses \\"the gift\\"...the gift to make each of her characters pulsate with life. There are only two kinds of short stories here: the extremely good ones and the excellent ones.<br /><br />Most of these are set in Munro's native home in Ontario and are filled with perceptive young women who are at the cusp of a life's transition. One of the best, for my money, is Admundsen. A young teacher named Vivien is hired to teach children with tuberculosis in a residential home; while there, she catches the fancy of the head doctor, Dr. Fox. Although hints to his cold character and selfishness are given in abundance, Vivien believes that marriage is in the offering until the inevitable betrayal occurs.<br /><br />Haven is another one I particularly liked. A growing girl is forced to stay with her aunt and uncle while her parents perform missionary work in Africa. Her aunt lives for her uncle; he, on the other hand, is self-contained and distant. Eventually, his irrational hatred for his musically-inclined estranged sister brings realizations to a head.<br /><br />Or take this one: Dolly. An elderly man - aged 83 - and his 71 year old wife contemplate a double suicide to be \\"gone when the going is good.\\" Yet when a woman from his distant past appears unexpectedly, all perspectives start to shift. \\"I had forgotten how old we were, forgotten everything. Thinking there was all the time in the world to suffer and complain,\\" the wife reflects.<br /><br />The stories start with younger characters and segue into the lives of older characters and then at the end, everything changes. Ms. Munro writes, \\"The final our works in this book are not quite stories. They form a separate unit, one that is autobiographical in feeling, though not, sometimes, equally so in fact. I believe they are the first and last - and the closest - things I have to say about my own life.\\"<br /><br />And what does the normally reticent Ms. Munro have to say about that life? \\"We say of some things that they can't be forgiven, or that we will never forgive ourselves. But we do - we do it all the time.\\" The reader is treated to insights on identities in the making, lives that become recreated or reinvigorated only later in life, and the growing into a sense of who we've been all along. Hopefully, Alice Munro - who is now an octogenarian - will have much to add to her own story and those of the wonderful characters that continue to live on.closest - things I have to say about my own life.\\"<br /><br />And what does the normally reticent Ms. Munro have to say about that life? \\"We say of some things that they can't be forgiven, or that we will never forgive ourselves.

B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box<br />Once again great book, never disappointed with Michael Connelly always worth the wait for the<br />next book. Harry Is one of the best characters ever created. I have read every book this author<br />has written, and am now looking forward to the next.

B009E3EXMU|5.0|I pre-ordered [[ASIN:B009E3EXMU Celebration Day (Deluxe Edition 2CD + 2 DVD (CD sized digipak)]]. This is one of the best purchases I've made in my life!!! HANDS DOWN!!! I received it on 11/20/12, opened the package, inserted disc 1 into the cd player in my company truck & was completely blown away. The cd's haven't been replaced in my player since that moment. Crystal clear, thunderous, professional, WALL OF SOUND!!! The following weekend I watched the dvd of the concert & OH MY GOD!!! A wonderful concert experience. (I didn't particularly care for the editing of footage from concert goers cellphones. Give me a break!!!) Robert, Jimmy, John, & Jason were in top form & enjoying every minute of there performance. Their interaction & feeding off of each other just gave me the chills from excitement. Jason was emotional & humbled (towards the end) being able to perform with his father's band. Watching the concert made me appreciate the cds even more. This package is money well spent.<br /><br />P. S.:  I bought [[ASIN:B009E3EWPI Celebration Day (2 CD + 1 DVD, DVD sized digipak)]] for my 62 year old boss (he's a rock & roll fan from way back, but, you wouldn't know it by looking at him). That morning I walked by his office & Zeppelin was blaring from his computer speakers while he was working on reports. He told me he is wearing the cds out in his truck!!!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|this is the first American Idol album where I truly felt that the artist stayed true to their sound. all the songs are good, some are great and it has the Home track also. loved it...
0345803485|5.0|Glad I read it. In perfect condition when I received it. Good book...hehe. :) Myhusband picked on me but I read it anyway.
0618918248|5.0|I was born and raised in South Korea. As far as I know, in northeastern Asia (includes Korea, Japan, China and so on) nobody thinks you immoral if you say you do not believe in a god. There is no absolute apparent single god here. The founders of the Chosun dynasty (Korea's last dynasty, 14C - 20C) were more like atheists. They criticized Buddhism for giving people false promises. So were they immoral? No. They followed the morality of Confucius. Actually their ethics were stricter than that of the western cultures, I think. As a child, we heard stories about people who sacrificed themselves to help their parents. We heard stories about parents who sacrificed their lives for their children. We were taught that that was the morality.<br /><br /> There have been vague super beings like \\"The heavenly being\\" or \\"The king of the sea\\" but no such thing as Yahweh in Korea (this sentence is revised for clarity). Many Koreans believed Buddhism but we did not worship him as the absolute god, Koreans did not try to make other people Buddhists by force, or died to honor Buddha, or kill others because they did not followed the teachings of Buddha.<br />When I said an American that I do not believe in God, he actually asked me that if I didn't believe in God, why not go kill people, because he would, if he were an atheist. This is a really strange way of thinking.<br /><br />So, to me, the whole western religiosity looks very weird. Western people may think it granted, but sometimes when we think about what is granted in another way, we find that there is no reason for that. Religion is like that.<br /><br />I hope this book would give religious westerners an insight that there really is no reason for many things they believe about religiosity.
0689835604|5.0|Our lil one loves this book. He wants it every night before bed. It was in perfect shape when I received it.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|this game is good for kids like 10 Years of age and up but needs more to explore but fun
B004KZDV8E|5.0|Very fast, but still relatively cool chip. Used in an HTPC and have absolutely no issues on 1080p playback or YouTube.
1119962846|5.0|I have been reading computer books for 30 years. This is the best I have seen. It goes down like a construction worker eating a big double cheese burger. The authors seem to know just what I need to know, and in the order I need to know it. The examples are just big enough to make the point. You can consume it in big chunks.
034580404X|5.0|When I first heard about this book series, I thought it would all be about sex and S&M. That is all I had heard when someone talked about these. I decided that if I wanted to be annoyed with the books, I should at least read the first one because I could give a real opinion. Needless to say, I was hooked. There is so much more to these books than sex. It is a sweet little love story and I enjoyed the read.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|I am disappointed with this book. There are very limited coverage on details of his missions, too much on his personal and family life. He even got his wife to write parts of the book. I regret wasting my money on this book.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|The reason I bought this movie is because of something that happened the night she saw this in drive-ins. Apparently my brother was a toddler and threw a rare temper tantrum. My mom swore up and down that my brother was possessed and she flipped out.  lol  Luckily someone else was able to calm him down and my mom realized that he wasn't truly possessed. This movie will make my mother laugh for sure when she opens it this Christmas.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|downlaoded it for free, great app and you don't have to deal with the annoying advertisements.  highly recommend getting this.
0792846443|5.0|My mom loves this movie. I had a hard time finding it in stores so I am thrilled to be able to get it on Amazon. My mother has passed the love of this movie onto my daughter so both of them will delight in owning this movie.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This game was a lot of fun. The graphics are amazing, and I really liked the whole search and find aspect of the game.
B00936A2SM|3.0|I think when the line-up was revealed for this album I immediately expected a masterpiece. Instead I got a lot of Scott and very little of Dennis and Jeff. I was just hoping for more I guess.....
B009VB7QQA|1.0|Funny premise, but it was a terrible movie...I guess I should have figured that it was going to be that bad.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is a very fun game if you have a facebook because if you don't; you will need to buy these credits with money. So if you are thinking about purchesing this, make sure you have a facebook. Everything else on this game is great!
B00271DNP4|5.0|helped to complete my set of the harry potter series. well worth the price paid and just loved the promptness of the order
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Ok... I admit it...  I'm a SW fan from the beginning...  This game is freaking fun! The characters are hysterical.  Well done Developers!<br /><br />I am holding the 5th star hostage pending my Hoth update... The game updated fine automatically on my (An)droid and my PC... but still hasn't updated my Kindle Fire HD...  I would love suggestions for this dilemma.
B00015YVDG|2.0|clever but much, much too long. . .<br /><br />The plot is clever, with some surprises along the way.<br /><br />One weakness is that it is stretched out and goes on and on, as when it<br />discusses the pros and cons of giving in to the kidnappers.<br /><br />Another weakness is the over-acting and over-dramatizing of two overly emotional immature parents.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love the game coin dozer with a capital D its sooooooo fun if u don't have it u need to get it Asap
B000HT38AS|5.0|Good quality video.  My prime interest was in City Heat, a very funny Clint Eastwood-Burt Reynolds that seems to have been forgotten. The two movies on the other disc are a bonus.
0062101897|5.0|This book is very fun to look through.  It is well worth the money, and I recommend it for anyone who loves the books and the movies!
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Thanks for the great price and movie. It was really good. But of course I love the 1st one the best.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I thought the plot was well conceived and proceeding nicely like the Grisham books of old. I was anticipating a twist at the end of the book but the anticipation eventually turned to disbelief. As the final chapter came to a close I felt I had just finished reading the script of a bad \\"B\\" movie. To be more specific I would have to begin with \\"spoiler alert\\" but perhaps my review should have been titled 'John jumps the shark\\".I did enjoy \\"The Litigators\\" very much and I thought it was his best book in a VERY long time but this book disappoints big time.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|I love Iron Man he is so funny and powerful. I like hero movies and this is a good one.
0812993292|4.0|Set in the English Countryside, Retiree Harold Frye and his wife, Maureen's day started like all the rest over the past 20 years--with Harold's almost reclusive, quiet manner and Maureen's detached, cold, angry over anything that Harold attempts demeanor. When an envelope addressed to Harold arrives, containing a goodbye note from former co-worker, Queenie  Hennessy, who is now in a hospice, he quickly writes a note in response and trots to the corner post box. As Harold is about to put it in the slot, he pauses and has a  revelation and walks further and further away from home, figuring when Queenie finds out he's walking to visit her, she'll live longer. He is not exactly dressed for this kind of trek--yachting shoes and a thin spring jacket, but continues on, from his home in Kingsbridge to Queenie in a hospice in Berwick-Upon-Tweed, 600 plus miles to the North. With each step, his whole purpose in life changes. He finally calls Maureen, who is oblivious to his trip plans and also calls the hospice to let Queenie know that he's on his way and to wait for him. He owes her this much at least--but for what?? Was there a romance that had gone wrong? Harold travels with just the clothes on his back, high hopes in his heart, a very limited amount of money in his retirement account, and the pair of letters in his pocket. Even though he is extremely timid, Harold pushes on, gains a comfortable stride and meets many interesting individuals along his snake-like route. He comes face-to-face with sad memories that have haunted him for his entire life and has hidden tender moments bubble up from within each time he tries to rest. Harold learns volumes about himself, the marriage to his love of his life, Maureen, which has seemed to go awry, and the cold relationship with his son, David. As angry as Maureen is, little by little, she finds herself worrying more and more about him and comes to the realization that she really does still love him. People from all walks of life aredrawn to Harold and his determination to complete his trip and some zany characters tag along with him as part of his journey, much to Harold's dismay. He would rather travel alone and at his own pace. Does he complete his pilgrimage to Queenie's bedside--and in time? At what price? Do we find out the true reason? Don't miss this hauntingly sad tale of one couple's life adventure--you will not be disappointed--and maybe a bit inspired!  Nancy Narma
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I didn't know when I got this movie if it would be good or not, but it was really good. I loved it. A lot of special effects and<br />a great super hero movie.Different then some of them, but I really enjoyed it. Got it for a great price .
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Really like the Jack Reacher series, have read them all and don't know how Tom Cruise is going to measure up to 6'5&#34; Jack Reacher, pun intended...........
B001HN6922|5.0|Love this movie, as good as the first. Can't say much, but glad I collect these movies. Disney/Pixar are one of my favorites.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|After all these years and still great novels, the twist is very well done.  Grisham has the knack for keeping involved
B002ZG99QS|5.0|This one might not be like the original but it has a lot of special effects. I really enjoyed it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Loved it.It was a great book to read and I recommend it to others who like this type of book.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Anyone that loves blood and horror will love this movie, it was a little too much for me. But it was a take off of Aliens. thanks

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved it.It was a great book to read and I recommend it to others who like this type of book.
1439153663|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. A truly powerful story that reminds us of the tragedy of slavery. The only unrealistic part of the book was that all of the bad-guys were white. This did not detract from the story but readers still would have rooted for the slaves if one or two of them were unsavoury.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This is an interesting picture of how screwed up Yemen is, but as DeMille's John Corey books go, the storyline feels forced.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|If you liked the other Dan Brown books, you'll like this one. The cool thing is all the locations and many of the little stories in the book are real. If you are into Freemason culture, you'll like it a lot.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely love this series. I would give it more stars if there were more stars to give.  From the cast, to the clothes, to the Abbey itself, this is a first rate production.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this continuing saga.  Can't wait to read book three.  I can't seem to stop reading once I start.  Fabulous
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Out of any game I have downloaded, this game easily has the most depth to it. I downloaded this game as the FAOTD quite some time ago, and now I am finally getting around to reviewing it. Normally this isn't my type of game, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. I was blown away by how addiciting this game gets. Each unit of every race you use has different advantages, and those change based upon the landscape. If you're playing a harder difficulty/level, a seamless strategy is crucial. Tons of fun to play for hours on end!<br /><br />Toshiba Thrive
B009VB97EY|5.0|MAGIC MIKE IS WARM,TOUCHING AND FUNNY. WATCH IT ONCE AND YOU WILL BE HOOKED!<br />HOT MEN, GOOD PERFORMANCES.,FUN FOR ALL.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is very similar to other match-3s, but I think it is definitely worth playing. There is somewhat of a plot behind it, but I wouldn't say that it is developed or contributes to gameplay at all. What is cool is that the game is actually educational! Shocker. As you progress through each of the ancient cultures, the game gives a quick overview of the culture and incorporates artifacts from these cities into gameplay. There are plenty of levels, but I wouldn't buy this expecting a challenge as the game progresses. It stays fairly easy throughout, and I don't believe there is a difficulty setting. However, out of all of my games, this FAOTD is the one I like to play to relax.<br /><br />Toshiba Thrive
B002PHVHFI|4.0|In The Aeroplane Over The Sea is such an iconic album and I would go as far as saying it's genre defining. I have started picking up some of my favourite albums on vinyl and this is one I definitely wanted. I had previously only listened to this album in high quality mp3s however I always felt like the acoustic guitars, Mangum's voice and the other analog sounds would lend itself well to vinyl.<br /><br />So how does the vinyl mix sound? I find the major difference for me is that Mangum's guitar is mixed down more and doesn't sound as warm, which is what endeared me to this album initially. I must say that it does sound great on the opening track &#34;The King Of Carrot Flowers Pt. One&#34; but is dramatically different by the time you get to the final song &#34;Two-Headed Boy Pt. Two&#34; which, possibly intentionally, sounds quite dull.<br /><br />But thats the great thing about vinyl - it helps you discover new things about albums. I think the horns and some of sound effects are really rich sounding. These are almost lost in the digital mixes. The title track for example has this eerie shrieking noise that really stands out. To me sounds like a theremin although the liner notes suggest otherwise. On tracks where you have a whole band playing, there is definitely a fuller sound. Vinyl has changed my perception of this album from a intimate little project to a louder, more dynamic sounding record.<br /><br />Packaging - This is a 180gm vinyl designed for audiophiles and fans, so I must say I'm a bit disappointed with the packaging. I thought there might be a gatefold or some additional perks but it's just your standard version of the cover and a sheet for liner notes. There is a card included to redeem mp3s in case you don't already have them.
1451627297|5.0|I had a lot of late nights because of this book, just couldn't put it down!!  I am so disappointed that I finished this book today. I really, really enjoyed it!!!

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I LOVE TWD!!!! This is my favorite show and this is a collectors item that every fan of the show must have
0425263908|5.0|I really liked this,  Better than \\"Fifty Shades\\"  I thought the SEX was Much more realistic and Sexy. This Book is well written and could NOT put it down.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Makes the Kindle filing system a little more intuitive and of course unlocks the camera, so that alone is worth it, especially for free.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book and it was the best hunger games book ever. I wish my sister was more like catniss
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like the interface and the ability to look at multiple locations all at once. I expect nothing less than excellence from The Weather Channel.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. I've been waiting to download it. Now that I have it, I can't stop playing it. I would recommend this to anyone.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I loved this cd from the very first listening and think every track is radio friendly enough to make it as a top forty hit! I am a big Bob Seger fan another Michigan alum and this cd has Kid Rock channeling Seger! It sounds like the best of Bob Segers stuff from the the mid 70's to the early 80's!
B007ADIRDM|5.0|Very good qulity, thanks i want to by something else here. shiping very fast. no troubles at all. nice to work with you
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is one of the weirdest animated films ever, but sooooo cool. it scared the crap out of my kids when they were little but they have grown to love it and this copy was for my now college age son.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My friend first showed me this app and I was instantaneously hooked. This game is super addicting and is a good whenever you have time to waste. I love it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I chose this product for the ability to read kindle books and works great.. But of course like everything else there is always room for improvement...
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Sit back and enjoy this version of Holmes. They could be a little more clever and a little less high tech but the acting is first rate and maybe they can evolve into the head game masters that Holmes and Watson are in other iterations.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I have never had my Kindle lose battery power while watching video, surfing the internet, or reading a book. Since this app tells me how long the battery lasts depending on what I am doing, I can make sure it is charging if it needs to. I recmmend this to everyone.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|If you loved the first movie, you might be let down by this one. Although it's worth seeing. It's certainly worth the $1.96 I paid on black friday. I wouldnt pay more than $4 for it though.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The CD's were brand new, so they were in perfect condition. Really enjoyed watching with my husband and learning some of the history behind WWII.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|NO stars for this one, it was free and not worth it.  It looks very promising but doesn't load past the second screen, if the developer fixes this glitch I will be more than happy to retry the game and to give it a new rating.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Dr. Davis is not a very skilled writer, and sometimes it's difficult to get past his awkward attempts at humor. However, this book is easy to scarf down and digest, stuffed with plenty of facts. His personal case studies are inspiring and his arguments are persuasive. One negative: Once you finish this book, you'll never be able enjoy a cookie or bagel again. It's up to you whether you want to take the red pill or the blue pill.
0767803434|1.0|It may have seemed pretty good when it came out but in retrospect this is one lousy movie. Clearly high raters are rah rah Americans. Much overacting on almost everyone's part. Harrison is just horrible. Actually he's never been very good has he?
B003YFIUW8|4.0|There has been a lot of hype around this book, so my expectations were quite high. If you're able to get past the inherently distracting 5-year-old voice of the narrator, you'll find that this is a book in 2 parts. The first half is far superior, while the second half tries too hard: awkwardly placed references by a Buddha-like psychologist, unnecessary social commentary on a clearly debased mainstream media. The entire implausible plot is more along the lines of a thriller, and it is a truly good thriller. Not sure if it deserved all the praise it received, but it's worth a read.
0525953590|5.0|I was intrigued when I read a reviewer who reported the book states there are: \\"twelve elementary particles that make up the universe\\". I have also read: \\"There are but multiples of three in all My universe\\" in a book called The Secret of Light. So it would follow...a need to find a 12th particle. I am anxiously awaiting the delivery of this book. Please note the capital \\"M\\" in My. Science meet religion.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Though 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' presents a more detailed version of how we ended up in our current health disaster, 'Why We Get Fat' is the book I recommend to friends and family; straightforward, scientifically accurate, and easy to understand, it completely shatters the 'fat makes you fat' myth. It's a brief, easy read, and therefore easier to push onto as many people as possible. :)
B009SMW9IW|5.0|We indeed love this collection of holiday songs. They're perfect for us. Tracy's &#34;secular carols&#34; resonates with us.<br /><br />Russ and Peg Hall, authors of The Summer of a Thousand Cheeses
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Couldn't put it down - again. Keeps you on the edge the entire book -<br />Couldn't put it down & didn't want to finish cause then it would be over!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I thought it was ok. ....it had many games wand they where cool until you play it for a Wylie then it becomes uninteresting .
B009RI4FRU|5.0|My high expectations of this movie were more than met.  Amazing cast of actors, great screenplay. My only regret is only renting it, instead of buying it :) *****
B00A8ECU24|5.0|we love this game... both my daughter and i play totally worth it! they need to make more games like this... MAYBE REVIVE GEM AND THE HOLOGRAMS... I WOULD LOVE THAT!
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This book gives me kind of revolutionary idea of what willpower is. It tells me that willpower may be a mind habit, but it is more like an inventory. You will start to beat yourself if this inventory last. So easing, re-energizing and training the mind , to restore the willpower, is a much smarter way to go forward.
0739375970|3.0|Although th story is still captivating, the reading has taken a nosedive.  The voice for a character in the first book has completely changed through the last 3.  Sam, Daenerys...many others.  Breaks the flow and takes you out of the story.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I like some others felt this game required me to use hints more than I wanted...I basically took notes from the hints and used them as directions...beat the game already! :( Expected there to be more...If the game would have been like some of the others of the same nature, I might have given it a better review. Never had an issue on my Fire...
0547884591|4.0|I've enjoyed reading all of Tim's books but this is one of my favorites.  There appears (from reading some of the reviews) you either like his \\"choose your own adventure\\" style or you don't.  If you find sidebars and interesting annecdotes distracting then the writing style may not \\"click\\" with you.<br /><br />The information remains useful for anyone however.<br /><br />Deconstruction & demystification are extremely powerful tools.  Question, condense, simplify & apply the relevant are incredible for learning and I loved how he utiized cooking to demonstrate them.  This is not a book on becoming a \\"Master Chef\\" but is a book on becoming a \\"Master Learner (and, honestly, if you apply even half of the cooking stuff you'll be a pretty decent cook as well).\\"<br /><br />This would be a GREAT high school graduation gift!  I'm already planning a bibliography of what I deem to be 'key' books for my kids to read & learn from when they get older and are getting to the point of striking out on their own.  This book will be on it.
B000068FWC|5.0|Ok this is an old classic of an album but anyone who ever enjoyed  Supertramp knows this is THE album.  I traveled through Europe in 1980 and listened to this album so everything I hear it I have a lot of good old memories. But the thing I like is the music is just as fresh and vibrant and classy now as it was  30 years ago. I know teenagers who prefer Supertramp to some of the music out today.
B004S82OAE|5.0|I used Todd Lammles books 10 years ago to get my CCNA and CCNP. I'm back to recertify and try for CCIE. His books never disappoint me. He makes subnetting easy....
B00000FC5H|5.0|I grew up listening to EWF, never owned an album of theirs until now. This is one which has all the classics. I love it when am at the gym and can exercise to it!
B004LUS390|5.0|I have always been wanting a good drawing app and it looks like I finally found one. This app is so fun and amazing. paying $2.00 was definatly worth it!!!
B008MEM24S|3.0|I think this is challenging at times. My 7 yrear old loves it. I've been able to get thru the first 20 levels fairly fast. I may give it a higher rating if I get stumped.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. the searching never gets boring.  so much fun and the social aspect where you can give and receive gifts is great too.
B0086700CM|3.0|fun game but too easy to have to add more money or coins to the game.  again this game is connected to the credit card
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I am very satisfied with this case! It is so much smaller than most cases. I think a clip would be nice to have as well.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|great chice for my 2 year old and 4 year old.  they love doing puzzels amd popping the bubbles.  wonderful
B009SKPVO8|5.0|Overall, this is a great strap to have it you plan to walk around a lot and take a lot of picture.  As for why, you don't need to take your camera out of its case and then put in back in over and over again.  The stap allow you put hang it at waist level and to the bottom of the camera.  Which makes it easy to put on and take off.  This way your camera is always at the ready.  My only wish was that the shoulder strap had a pocket to carry and extra battery or memory card.
B008NMT684|5.0|The children all love this game.  Keeps them interested for long periods of time.  Helps with hand and eye coodination skills.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|I agree with one reviewer, when they said \\" If you're envisioning Species, you may be let down. If you're thinking Alien; you could be disappointed. It does however; lie somewhat in-between those two great films. \\"  I absolutely love these Medical-Sci-Fi films, where a great imagination can produce films on things that could possibly happen, but do not, in the real world.  Thank goodness the morals in our medical and science world, prevent this type of experimentation, but for an entertaining movie, they are great!  As for this Splice movie, I would of like more details showing in the development of their subject.  Since Splice ended with a possible off-spring from the original experiment, I would love to see a Splice 2 in the near future.  Great special effects!
B00355L2TU|5.0|All three of the workouts on this DVD are great, alone or combined for a longer workout.  The 3-2-1 format keeps the heart rate up and makes the workouts fly by quickly.  I have really noticed an improvement in my core strength since discovering this and other Jillian workouts a year ago.  I used to wake up every morning with a sore lower back and struggled through the pain to run and walk for exercise.  After diligently working out with Jillian 6 days per week for a year, I now have a strong core and lower back, and I am pain free.  I never thought I could actually do back strengthening exercises in addition to ab work, but now I can do Supermans with the rest of 'em!  My advice to other back pain sufferers is to stick with it -- modify exercises as needed in the beginning as you are building core strength.  There were several exercises I couldn't do or had to modify in the beginning because of my back pain (Supermans were out of the question), but I can do them now thanks to all those ab exercises and planks.  I highly recommend this DVD - it can change your life!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really liked this book. The characters were likeable with a great sense of humor. I was definitely drawn in from the first page. It was a refreshing, light read. My only regret is that it ended so soon and I would have liked more. Guess I'll be buying more titles from this author!
0439813786|5.0|Hugo Cabret is one of the best books I've ever read! And I'm glad to have been able to have read this<br />Book, because it's a book I will never forget reading. The beautiful book I would recommend to anyone who loves a creative story with a wonderful twist.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|its fun and easy for kids.here are good things about this game<br /><br />1.good graphics<br />2.cute animals<br />3.good mini games<br /><br />its fun for younger kids to play and a good way to pass time.
B005HSL626|5.0|good game....play all the time....I recommend this to all people.<br />play, play, play, have fun and ninja that fruit-okay. yes...
B008PE9GSA|5.0|The Guitar playing is awesome. Gritty, bluesy, raspy and definitely Rockin'. The Best song \\"Flyin High\\" sounds just like AC/DC. Get it at Best Buy and you get two extra songs for a total of twelve. An All Guitar-Driven C.D.
030758836X|4.0|Nick and Amy Dunne live the good life in New York City, both with careers they love and lots of money to spend. But when the recession hits and they lose their jobs, they're at a loss as to what to do. Nick decides they should move back to his hometown in order to take care of his mother, dying of cancer, and his father who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Nick quickly fits into this completely diverse lifestyle but Amy has a hard time adapting. On their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy mysteriously disappears. At first the police treat it as a missing person but when evidence of a massive blood spill in the kitchen turns up, they begin to suspect murder and their eyes turn toward Nick, who has been acting suspicious since the beginning.<br /><br />This book is told in two sections, each one with alternating points of view of Nick and Amy. Gillian does a good job slowly revealing facts and providing nicely delivered twists while peeling away the layers of the personas of Nick and Amy, These two are not likeable characters although this does not take away from the read but rather enhances it. The ending may bother some readers although others may see it as the ultimate twist to the story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Everyday I play solitude and have enjoy since 2011. it is a lot of thinking and so much fun playing with it all day long. thank!
B000YJ6736|4.0|Reading the narrative from the male and female protagonist regarding the same situation as it transpires offers an interesting perspective about how situations spin out of control despite good intentions. It was also interesting to consider the sexual tensions in male/female relationships from the 60's and consider whether much has changed in the way each sex interprets the other.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|the game itself is not bad at all, though character prices are too high and everything produces money at the exact same rate and some take longer than others but do give more at once.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|After hearing all the bad things about this movie, I rented it anyway.  It turned-out to be one of the finest SciFi movies I've seen (and I've seen most all of them).  It's not a straight-forward \\"good guy vs. bad guy\\" storyline.  There are many twists, so many that it makes a 2nd viewing almost mandatory in order to catch everything you missed the 1st time around.  The special effects are very impressive, and the 3D is superior.  The cast handles the demands rather flawlessly via excellent performances (Lynn Collins carries her substantial role exceptionally well).  Woola the dog-like creature (in behavior, not appearance) added that right-amount of Disney Charm. Taylor Kitsch's performance as the lead also shined.  At first, you don't really care for his character at all.  By the end of the movie, you're downright cheering for him!  This results from the excellent character development throughout the movie.  This is not a film for young children, but if I were a 10yr old boy again ...!  This will be the surprise movie I start after the holiday dinner.  The older folk will enjoy the story and its twists, and the younger ones will love the action!  If you liked Star Wars, you'll like John Carter.  Sound acting, a great storyline, and visual effects that \\"take you there\\" -- anyone who appreciates these qualities in a SciFi movie will thoroughly enjoy John Carter!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I have really had a lot of fun with this. I laugh every time I play with it. Not enough children to help me play, but it's hilarious when one is available. I have Dogs and Parrots so they keep me entertained. Especially two of my parrots get very excited when they hear the playbacks. I have had fun sending talking videos to friends too. Absolutely wonderful game.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is a great story.  Told in old time way.  I wanted to read the story before the film came out and i'm glad I did.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|is very fun for the price. it is hard on some levels but very challenging.  good for all ages to play
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think that the book was great!!! It has a great sense of reality , embarrassment and humility it is awsome
0802473156|5.0|This book is about more than relationships and marriage, but even if that were it's only application it would be one worth reading.<br /><br />It goes over 5 different Love Languages, or 5 basic needs and how each of us prioritizes which we are most receptive to.<br /><br />If you are interesting in understanding, developing or repairing any relationships with another human being, I would urge you to give this book a read.<br /><br />I am an ecclesiastical leader and as I have counseled with spouses or parents who do not understand why their efforts are unrewarded or why their relationships are strained, I have found myself referring to this very volume.<br /><br />It's short, easy to read and very down to earth. It is one of a handful of books that I read and re-read to glean new insights and to further entrench it's teachings.<br /><br />Give it a shot. It could very well change the course of your marriage - and your life.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|However, you really cannot over lap sounds, as the volume seems to play at same levels. If you can let me know, then its a five for sure
B006P3HXZG|5.0|A Very funny film that looks better in 3D. Great vocal performances and Photo realistic scenes.<br />Totaly enjoyable for a family movie night.
B00932A2MC|2.0|There are too many loose ends in this plot and too many stereotypical characters to put it in a &#34;great si fi&#34; category.  Troubled kid brother joins Navy to follow his older sibling who (of course) gets killed by invading aliens that look disconcertingly like Old order Amish sporting porcupine beards!  And speaking of Navy, clearly that service had a hand In the production....probably a recruiting ploy.  Seems the Blue Water Navy saved the world all by itself.  hoo-raa!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can barely wait for the next book!! Maybe I'll just have to read them all over again to occupy the wait time
B009KHCRVO|2.0|This film has some &#34;giggle&#34; factor and leaves the definite impression that the director wanted his tongue in your cheek!  Like Mel Brooks's classics, however, many bits are over the top and frankly sophomoric.  This is tolerable in a 3 dollar rental is you like some of the campy si fi films on occasion.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Overall a good book.  It was hard for me to get into the repeated use of the stairs.  Do porters haul the handicapped people up and down the stairs?  Also found it silly that it took the mayor and the deputy days to travel the stairs.  I was kind of glad when the mayor and deputy we dead because they took so much time (pages of this book) using the stairs.
B00722ZIBA|4.0|I have to admit, Incognito is one of my favorite groups, and I own almost all of their music.  Without going into too many details, let's just say: \\"You Can Never Go Wrong with Incognito.\\"  Although I was late picking up \\"Surreal\\", better late than never, it's well worth it.  If you get the opportunity to see them live, don't pass up the chance.
B004LQGXPA|5.0|Fantastic account of the interpersonal relationships between Patton, Bradley and Montgomery.<br />Great insight into Rommel and Patton's strategies and mutual respect for one another.
B008NNNF7G|4.0|I have only listened to it once, but I immediately liked it.  However, despite good lyrics and music, it seemed too familiar, sort of a rehash of Little Piece of Dixie.  And there wasn't a song like &#34;Restless&#34; that I want to listen to over and over.  But if you like good southern rock I think you will like it.  I never heard of them until I saw them at a Zac Brown concert.  I wish more people knew about them.  Charlie Starr is great musician and has a killer voice.  Why hasn't &#34;Restless&#34; been played by mainstream radio?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it is kind of like temple run but there are more obsticales...... so if you like temple run GET THIS GAME!!!!!!If you don't like temple run GET IT ANYWAY!!!!I mean guys it is free so if you don't like it the worst you can do is delete it!!!!!!
B001GCUER0|5.0|If you love Mad Men and the characters, you love every season....enough said! This one is just a wonderfully juicy as all the rest of the series!
0812550706|5.0|I really enjoyed this book when it first came out years ago... It gives and inkling on military tactics even though the protaganists are children...It gives also a glimpse on how bootcamp is run in the real military, obviously it isnt' the same but you get an idea that its closer to real bootcamp than a boyscout outing.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci is simply the best always, no matter what the read! The Innocent was a really good book to read. Loved it!
B0041KKYGU|3.0|I actually like Bad Teacher, mostly because I had similar teachers during junior high and love Lucy Punch as the quirky teacher Amy Squirrel. I've watched the movie several times on Starz and I eventually bought Unrated Edition DVD for a $1.96 at a Black Friday sale.<br /><br />Why the three star rating?<br /><br />Bad Teacher is funny at times, but it could have much better. Considering the R rating, I expected it to be more raunchier like more recent comedies, like The Hangover, Bridesmaids, and 21 Jump Street, but instead the writers decided to play it safe. I would have liked to seen more the classroom antics with Cameron Diaz and of course the plot could have been better.<br /><br />Overall, I still like the movie, but it is not the greatest comedy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a great read! I'd recommend it to anyone. It's very entertaining and keeps you reading all the way to the end. Enjoy!
B004HO6HWA|4.0|The Mechanic is $1.96 movie that I bought during last week's Black Friday. The movie is a remake of Charles Bronson's 1972 action film of the same name. Over the years I have become a fan of Statham's movies and surprisingly The Mechanic is above average action flick. Both Jason Statham and Ben Foster give great performances. The director Simon West also did a great job putting together a tight movie. Overall, even though it wasn't a perfect movie, I was entertained until the final explosion.
B004HX4RT6|1.0|This game is not as good as I like.  It will not make your move even if a legal move at times.  It seems to lock up so no I will not recommend this to anyone.
0393334988|4.0|I guess I didn't realize how much the &#34;railroad&#34; would come into play for such a long time at the start of the book.  Took me FOREVER  to get thru it and I almost gave up reading the remainder.  However , now that I'm at the part of his life as a POW, it's more interesting.  I actually had purchased the book for my elderly father (79) but realize now that it's not something he would have the patience to read.  Kinda disappointing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first Gillian Flynn book.....but will not be the last.<br />Great plot, kept you in suspense right up to the last page.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book was neither good nor bad. Too  much repetitive stuff(sex).  Had  it's  interesting parts.I will read the  3td<br />book just to  finish  the series
0061474355|5.0|This is my absolute, all time, favorite book. I fell in love with it as a teenager and still to this day I have not read a book I enjoy more. You know when you read a book that you connect with so fully and you love it so completely that you absolutely must share it with anyone and everyone? This is that book. I could never keep it to myself because that would be selfish and as a result I own probably around 4 copies right now. I loaned so many out that I had to keep re-buying it. Not one time was it a waste of money. And I can tell you the books withholds a lot of wear and tear. I know because I re-read them so much! Garth Nix does such a marvelous job at making you feel like you really are in the environment. It is exciting and thought provoking and just...wonderfully fantastic. I just have such glowing praise for the book.<br /> I actually cannot wait to have a cat to name it Mogget. And Sabriel, she's so strong and it was a very nice role model to have growing up. Touchstone, too, was such a well thought out character. Every inch of the world Nix creates has been so carefully thought out and it truly does show. He makes every part of the book feel so real. Many times I find that fantasy novels  with good plots have terrible characterization or just unnatural character thinking. But with Nix's writing everything emotion comes to life and the plot is so amazing that the two mixing is the most pleasuable reading experience you will ever have in your life. One sure fire way to ruin a good fantasy/sci-fi book is the author neglecting to keep up with real emotions. You feel fear because the protagonist feels fear and etc. Nix keeps in time with the real emotions. I love this book. Sabriel is just so different from any book I have ever read. The book and writing is in a class of its own. I cannot and will not recommend a book with more praise than Sabriel.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|The film opens with a lengthy character build-up of Pi. It starts off with the crude explanation on how he got his name. It contrasts this with Pi's discovery of religion to the point of believing in universalism. His lofty ideas are quickly contrasted with a dose of reality when a tiger, he thinks he has connected with, eats a live goat. After he develops a love interest we finally come to the meat of the tale.<br /><br />His family opts to go to Canada on a Japanese merchant ship and if everything went okay, you wouldn't see a picture of Pi in a boat with said tiger promoting this film. His life's experience are reflected in his relationship with the tiger and survival at sea.<br /><br />Pi's life is one filled with contrasts. He is a microcosm of India and perhaps the world as his name is symbolic of the constant the defines circles, orbs, and globes. That is the spiritual aspect. However his name derives from the &#34;P&#34; word giving it a dose of crude reality. The film/book is designed to be a metaphor. This is demonstrated in the end when Pi gives us two stories, then asks, &#34;Which do you prefer?&#34; as a way to test one's views in a world of contrasts.<br /><br />While the film is interesting on a number of levels, it is heavily narrated with an accent. This caused me to occasionally miss a word every now and then. Hopefully the DVD will have English subtitles.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. While rated PG I thought Pi dropped the F-bomb near the end when he was talking about the two Japanese investigators. It was tough to tell with the accent. Beginning of film frequently refers to pi**ing.
B000Z45PEC|4.0|Bought this for a five year old, who was thrilled to get it, and as far as I know, it has been great!
B005M2V2K8|5.0|This is smaller than expected, but cute for my grandson.  Hope he enjoys playing with it, and it stays clean?
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am not a big fan of apocalyptic science fiction. The genre is so bleak. This series is no exception, but it is so well written, the characters so well drawn, that I'll keep reading until I find out what happens.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|If u like games like must this the game for u. I wish there were more like this. The only draw back it wasn't long enough.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i dl it for my wife and she loves it. plays it everyday. the only problem with it is the getting friends and the expensive ponies.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Honestly ... I just spent ten minutes trying to figure out how to add my location. I found the icon ... typed my location ... and it won't save it. What a POS!!! Please don't be fooled by the pretty graphics. This app fails to do the basic stuff. Read the other reviews, and use your money for another app that works.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|An absolute piece of junk. Cannot drive tape at correct speed and interference in the useless recording at the end of each side.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|We have as a family enjoyed every moment of this season. From our oldest (18) to our youngest (8) there has been things for everyone.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|While connectivity and speed are not an issue, the ability to see or access anything other than the very most recent postings on your Facebook app is nonexistent. I recently purchased the new Kindle Fire HD (8.9) and have had this issue ever since. I have twice uninstalled and reinstalled the Facebook app but to no avail. I don't have this problem on either my pc or laptop. Unless this problem is resolved, I cannot and will not recommend purchasing the Kindle HD to any of my friends,family, or business associates.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My friends have been urging me to read this series for months, but with my busy schedule I finally fit it in. And I'm so glad I did! In less than a week I'm already on book 4! This is a stellar tale about the greek/roman backgrounds and I relate to it relatively easily! I will be suggesting this to anyone in need of a great read! Even though it is a 5 book series, even if you don't have time to read them all, the ending is thorough enough to stop, but also filled with cliff hangers if you're eager to jump into another book!
B000V63CI0|3.0|I wish I didn't have to buy the entire album for just the one song; I only wanted the extended version of &#34;I would do anything for love&#34;
B001J20ZIA|2.0|As an amazon prime member, I am disappointed this video<br />AND all amazon instant videos do not offer subtitles for those who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. I was disappointed again I could not watch this video with my children. They seemed to enjoy the movie, however.
B00260HH3K|3.0|Before I get to my perspective I just want to share that I work with 13-16 year-old boys and some of them skipped free video games (a big deal because they only get the change to play like 3-4 times a week for maybe 30\\" a pop) in order to watch this movie.  If they were reviewing this movie then I think they would give it at least 4 stars and probably 5.<br /><br />I'm not a 15-year-old boy (...well, kinda at heart) but I do enjoy martial arts and fantastical movies and this has both of those elements in it with a lot of special effects and Mr. Hardboiled himself, Chow Yun Fat (that was a big surprise).  For what it seems to be (a live action fantasy based upon the Dragonball Z anime & manga) it was enjoyable but unspectacular.  The leads of Goku and the girl he's crushing on, Chi Chi, are both likable and both bring ample physicality to their roles.  Goku is the would-be savior of the world when some green-skinned conqueror named Piccolo (isn't that a musical instrument?) comes to call.  There are some decent action moments and bright visuals.  The attractive but too-old-for-the-role Emmy Rossum plays a screwball-ish character and feels out of place but other than this the movie comes off as otherwise harmless Saturday morning cartoon fare turned live action.<br /><br />Adults who don't like Saturday morning cartoons would probably not be looking at this in the first place and would be better served watching \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\".  Those who enjoy martial arts, fantasy, and bright colors will find something to enjoy here.  Me?  I'll watch it again in a few years with my son and appreciate it just about as much then as I do now.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|I don't generally write reviews but I felt compelled after reading so many negative ones. The negative reviews tend to fall into one of two categories: people who have never read the book or seen the BBC miniseries and find it \\"boring,\\" and those who have read the book and/or seen the BBC mininseries who hate any changes and hold the miniseries as the perfect good.<br /><br /> For the former, it can only be said that they perhaps would be better off viewing something that demands less of their attention and effort. (I really don't intend for that to sound like a put-down, so if it does, I apologize.)<br /><br />For the latter, it can only be said that while some of the changes are nonsensical (Guillam is a homosexual?!?) or unneccessary (why combine Westerby with Collins when Collins himself would have been sufficent for the plot?) they are hardly damaging to the integrity overall. In fact in some instances, I found that some of the changes enhanced the story. For example, I really enjoyed the confrontation scene between Smiley and Esterhause on the tarmac as opposed to just some room in a safe house. Quite thrilling.<br /><br />As to holding the BBC miniseries as the best representation: while I enjoyed the miniseries I felt that it's age was showing. In addition, while I respect Alec Guiness, I have long felt that all of his performances tend to be similiar. Whatever role he is playing he always exudes strength and his portrayal of Smiley is no exception. Gary Oldman's performance is much more represemtative of the character in the book. Diffident and quiet, slow and introspective, old and tired; Gary Oldman astutely portrays a character that is morally conflicted, in pain, intelligent and underestimated. Exactly as he is in the book.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was an anglophile dream come true. John Hurt, Colin Firth, Stephen Toby, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, and Tom Hardy, in my opinion, were exceptional. In fact, the whole cast was so full of British talent and the movie so short (relatively) that I don't think the great Ciaran Hinds had any speaking lines!<br /><br />As to the other aspects of the film, the cinematography was gorgeous, the set pieces extraordinary (60's London, Turkey), and the soundtrack evocative and in some places stunning (the use of La Mer at the end was inspired).<br /><br />In short, this is one of my favorite movies.<br /><br />I've read the book (the entire Karla trilogy in fact, as well as Call for the Dead, A Murder of Quality, and The Spy Who Came In From the Cold), and have seen the BBC miniseries. This theatrical version, while too short, is superior to the miniseries and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />If only they could have made it a miniseries with this cast. Sigh.
B003B02O14|5.0|This one takes a different route for a &#34;Grishmam Lawyer&#34; tale.  I think you'll find it entertaining. I recommend you check it out.
B0057AOOZ0|5.0|i love 4. i think the album was great and you could listen to the whole ablum through and through. many hits off of the album. we all know beyonce makes great music and this was just another testament to that. she always makes pretty much every song a single and it lets you know what to expect from the album.
0545128285|5.0|This book is a must have for any HP fan!  Its like owning a party of the story... and the stories inside are great as well.
B008KW43TE|5.0|i love this album. every song is great. the guy is a great singer and you get what you expect when you buy the album. the singles are great, the other songs on the album are great. i cant point out one song i dont like
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app rocks! I don't know what people are whining about skipping. Omg the options for playing sounds are great. My favorites are heavy rain, thunder and a kitty purring. Lol. Most normal people will certainly enjoy!
B000FA5STS|5.0|This was my first David Baldacci book and I loved it.  Will be reading more of his books for sure.
141659521X|5.0|I have read every one of Vince Flynns books and read them each several times.  This is the best yet.  I know, we all say its is the best yet, but Vince always tops his last book, somehow.  This is packed with action and intrigue.  Some twists are also included.  Vince is probably the best at what he does and his main guy, Mitch Rapp, always amazes me. Vince has made him a hero in the counter terrorism field. Irene Kennedy, the head of the CIA is another great leader in this field.  You try Vince Flynn one time and you wont be able to stop.I'm not going to get into the story at all, that is for you to do, and believe me you wont get tired of this mans creative writing.  Keep it up Vince and dont let Mitch retire either.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|They always say you never forget your first Doctor. Eleven is mine (I've gone back and watched other Doctors, and have loved them all). I loved everything about series six - most especially the reveal of who River Song is and what that means for our Doctor. The extras are great (the Night extras were worth the price of the series!). Overall is that if you love Doctor Who, buy the complete series and just settle in to run through every emotion you can think of. Best show ever.
159420411X|1.0|This is a book about prediction and forecasting. Let's start by clarifying that Nate Silver does not know very much about statistics or induction. His Amazon page describes him as a \\"statistician\\", but he is nothing of the sort. Nate Silver is an amateur baseball sabremetrician and bad online poker player (he describes how bad he was in this book), who happened to get lucky by exactly pegging a couple of primaries in the 2008 Obama-Clinton contest (Indiana and North Carolina). He was subsequently heralded as some sort of quant genius, and it was ignored that he did quite poorly in subsequent primary predictions. Since then he has been able to predict elections reasonably well, but not significantly better than a random person could do by taking a naive average of polling data. Somehow this bizarre path to nerd-heaven qualifies him to write this book, which is so dull that it makes Malcolm Gladwell look like an intellectual giant (Silver oddly compares Gladwell to Freud and Marx in the second chapter while denigrating all three as inferior to himself).<br /><br />Returning to statistics, his two paragraph overview of Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches is absurd, likely owing to his profound ignorance on the topic. If you don't know anything about statistics, you probably won't learn very much here, other than that frequentists are idiots whose Gaussian obsession blinds them to Silver-like greatness. Silver also provides such pearls of wisdom as: be careful not to overfit; don't ignore uncertainty; always consider context! None of this is grounded in any type of theory, it's just empty pablum.<br /><br />In the process, Nate Silver interviews everyone from seismologists to sabremetricians in an attempt to elucidate something, but fails to make any point whatsoever. All we really learn is that you have to have a feel for the problem you are attempting to predict, a point that is underscored by Silver's incompetence at discussing several of these fields that he has noexpertise in. Silver is unable to understand the context in which any of these predictions are made, such as when he chides climate scientists for mixing science and politics. It's as if Silver isn't aware that there is a multi-million dollar corporate campaign to discredit their work. This is because like any wannabe technocrat, Nate Silver thinks that data can save the world. Oh that natural disaster? Should have looked more closely at the error bars! Oh that epic financial crisis? Should have listened to Amos Tversky! It's about context Nate - you don't know it, and so you shouldn't be talking about it. Silver thinks that he's a fox in the Isaiah Berlin sense (not without the obligatory swipe at Berlin), but what he doesn't understand is that you can only be a 'fox' if you have a profound understanding of the world and a coherent worldview. Otherwise you just come across as a self-contradictory know-it-all.<br /><br />Silver's focus is on econo-wonk subjects partially because he is a free market capitalist cheerleader (a result of his uncritical thinking about everything) who seems to have an unhealthy obsession with money (he spends pages glorifying some idiot who bet his life savings on the LA Lakers), and partially because he isn't qualified to discuss serious science (as his embarrassing attempt at climate science shows - see Michael Mann's review). He offers such profound idiocy as \\"molecules are much too large to be discernibly influenced by quantum physics\\", and \\"The human brain is quite remarkable; it can store perhaps three terabytes of information\\". At another point he declares that forecasting has little in common with physics and biology (gee, I could have sworn Bayesian inference was a hot topic in those subjects). When it comes to AI/machine learning, Silver evidently knows little about contemporary approaches, and thus chooses to recount the same old 15-year old tale about how Deep Blue beat Kasparov (*yawn*).<br /><br />Nate Silver is a perfect example of how degenerated our technocratic neoliberal society has become. These days you don't have to understand anything to opine on it. You just need to (1) obnoxiously pretend to be the smartest quant in the room, (2) assume everyone else is a fool who hasn't heard of kurtosis, and (3) mouth the free market ideology that our ruling class wants to hear. Nate Silver is the perfect example of the type of thoroughly mediocre and uncritical individual best suited for this task.

B002C4YYEU|5.0|Saw it when it was in the theaters....loved it then....love it still!<br /><br />Great movie for a cuddle up and stay in nite!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Pros: This game was an absolute pleasure to play. From its puzzles to its stunning beauty and pleasant sounds, this game is worth the money.<br /><br />Cons: I can't think of any other than I wish the game was longer with more puzzles.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good instructional book on the training provided to members of our military. I would recommend it to anybody who considers a military career!
1608871452|5.0|I'm not going to rehash what everyone so far has said...just underscoring them, and  wishing I could give this ten stars!<br />This book is absolutely amazing and within its title, the word \\"ESSENTIAL\\" actually translates to: \\"A MUST-OWN BY EVERY CARD CARRYING SUPERNATURAL FAN.\\"<br />I love it so much that I am looking to order another.<br />Mr. Knight needs to follow up with Volume 2.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|3-1/2 Stars<br /><br />Megan Scott attends her cousin's bachelorette party in Vegas and wakes up married to a stranger. She barely remembers meeting the guy, but Conner Reed apparently remembers everything and goes about trying to re-convince her he's the one for her.  Megan reluctantly agrees to a trial period so see if this marriage will work, and Conner pulls out all the stops.<br /><br />WAKING UP MARRIED was a fun and light read I really enjoyed.  Megan has a plan: a plan that doesn't require a man, only an anonymous sperm donor and definitely not a husband. Conner has his own plan: he wants a marriage of convenience and is sure Megan is the one. I loved watching their first night together. It was quite funny that Megan remembers NOTHING and Conner tries so hard to remind her of all the things they discussed.  They both have their hangups about this situations that sometimes grated, but it never went on too long.<br /><br />As fun as this story was, it was the lacking in details that pulled this story down for me. What does Conner do for a living? What about Megan? We know he has buckets of money and owns his own company...but what does he do? Megan has \\"big projects\\" but what are those projects? What color eyes do they have? I don't know the answer to any of these questions. What about the secondary characters? The few we meet are shallow caricatures who only talk about relationships.  It seemed like the author kept a lot of things generic so that we can insert whatever we wanted into whatever was lacking, but instead without the detail I felt like I was reading a first draft instead of a published work. It didn't feel real. We are told most things and seeing little. But maybe that is the draw to this style of writing, that it is an escape.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|This would be a good read for a very young inexperienced person.<br />In my opinion It really boils down to common sense.
B000T433CO|4.0|Cast of knowns compile this funny, romantic must-see for the holidays or anytime you need a break from politics, despair, violence, or incomprehensible sci-fis.  While Cameron Diaz' theatrics wear on one after the third meltdown, the rest of the cast carries the flick.  Good performances by Eli Wallach, Jack Black, Jude Law, and Kate Winslet won't disappoint.
B008CP93S0|4.0|This movie is wickedly funny! Is it kinda dumb?  Yes. Will 20-somethings not \\"get it\\"? Yes. But for anyone 50+ it will definitely give you \\"flashbacks\\"! LOL!! (My 82-year old mother-in-law loved this movie!!) I admit I was surprised by the very brief but very graphic nudity, but can't imagine the film without it, as it is not what you think and is absolutely hysterical! Jennifer Aniston is perfect in this role, and Paul Judd gives a great performance as well. I could watch this again and again, it is so funny!
0446585041|4.0|This was a listening to one of Helen's very funny monologues, very entertaining, I think now I am going to buy the previous books.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|The stunts in this film is enough to see it.  Tom is amazing.  I can not tell you how many times I caught my breath or jump while watching this film.<br /><br />Is Tom as handsome as ever?  Yes<br />Are the stunts amazing?  Yes<br />Is it worth viewing:  Of Courseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee<br /><br />The storyline is ok, however the action scenes will keep you hook.  Besides Mission Impossible II, this is probably my new all time favorite Mission Impossible flick.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|The quality of bluray will never let me down. you can see the fabric pils on Kermit as he dances! The only thing that I noticed about this edition, is that they cut out the scene where Scrooge is with the ghost of Christmas past and  his girlfriend sings the break up song &#34;The Love is Gone&#34;. It is not a bad decision to get rid of it, except that at the end when the group sings &#34;The Love we Found&#34;, the symbolism is lost.
B006E2W24U|4.0|Zoe does an excellent job in this film.  I love the action, and the fight scenes are realistic.  This film did not receive the attention is so richly deserve. Which is too bad because it rings right up with my other favorite female action star, Angelina Jolie's Salt.<br /><br />I always like Zoe's work, however this film put her over the top.  It was nice too see a woman of color play the lead in a fast-paced action flick, instead of the girlfriend, the best friend of the lead actress,  or the woman in distress.<br /><br />Zoe keep up the new work.  Amazon customers, give this film a chance.  If you like action-flicks, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S.  Little Colombiana was amazing too...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love the book but not the ending. It leaves you wanting to no more! Can't wait for the next one

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a great drawing app for all kids and even older non serious artists. It does not function like other apps because when you choose your color is is just options instead of the color circle which I think is easier. Whoever is willing to spend their money will get what they are paying for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i cant put this game down and its so addicting its a really good app or should i say great app
B000FC13MM|5.0|I first read this book when I was about 12 and have reread it multiple times. It never fails to fascinate and inspire me, and every time I recommend this book to a friend they love it. It's definitely one of those books that you can't put down. It's in a league of its own and it's one of the books that first inspired my love of reading and especially fantasy! Adults and teens alike can enjoy this trip into one of the most exciting worlds you'll ever encounter!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|it was a great read.very difficult to read on a kindle because of all the maps.it was like reading War and Peace the times
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This is a dark series. Don't really see how appropriate it is for kids, but I like this series. The things these kids do in life and death situations is astounding. This book seems like a modern day 1984
B007HACDLK|4.0|I anxiously await each new offering by Flynn in November. This one did not disappoint. Flynn is the best of this genre (undercover operatives).

B000TO0TCQ|5.0|Its a good book with a lot of action in it  . it is the best book i have ever read! I'm confused at the very end of it though!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|There are a lot of ads but the game is kinda fun! I like the version on my phone way better. The cards are small &amp; there is a lot of unused screen space. Compaired to everything out there now this could be way better.
B00915G6MG|5.0|STARTED WITH FIRST SEASON & have them all. Seen so many re-runs on TV & still keep watching them LOL As with all the rest of the seasons as they come out I will have them also!!!!  ADDICTIVE
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have all of Susan's albums. This is my favorite. I listen to it all the time. She has really put together a beautiful show this time. I'm so happy I decided to buy it. So happy she was discovered. I saw the night she auditioned, and the look of surprise on the judges' faces. She was really an unexpected discovery. God Bless you Susan, and I'm so happy for you. Follow your dreams, you never know when something like this can happen in life.
B00915G6SU|5.0|Started at the first season and have just kept going on & on. Wish they would allow me to get them loads faster.
1609611543|4.0|I think this book is very good except that he recommends Splenda and Truvia as sweetners. I had a really bad experience with Splenda and I think it's poison myself; however, I am not the only one. If you \\"google\\" 'the effects of Splenda', you will see that many people have had problems with it.  Also, Dr. Joseph Mercola writes about it as well.<br /><br />Also, Truvia is put out by Coca-Cola and Cargill; it is not just Stevia and not as pure, I believe as Stevia Leaf.  Anyway, I wouldn't use a whole lot of those fake sugars.  If I really felt like I needed some sugar, I'd just have a little real sugar.<br /><br />As far as wheat goes, hopefully, \\"Man\\" will learn from his mistakes and stop messing around too much with \\"Mother Nature\\" - GMO's, etc.  We only have one planet and it's time we use common sense and try to keep it natural.
B00915G6NK|5.0|LOVE THIS SINCE IT STARTED & will continue to buy as they r released to buy them all !!! GREAT ...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this for my kids. its easy to use on the go when u r in a hurry. everone should use this on there kindle.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Chaplin played by Robert Downey Jr. (brilliant by the way) is not what is called a story. It is life that Chaplin lived - poor, broken hearted, rich, taken-advantage-of, sad, ambitious, sympathetic. Just about everything a common man would experience in life. But the only difference is Chaplin is not common. He is a strong person who smiles in the face of grief, excels when the time is against you and then makes the best of every opportunity. A great movie to watch for Chaplin fans.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Works with most devices we have at home, kindle, iphone and ipad so we are all communicating from different devices.<br /> Not bad for a free app!
B004TI5N38|4.0|This is not one of Baldacci's best, but still a good read.  Kinda drags around the middle.  Too much like a crime scene investigation without a lot of shooting, killing, and blowing up during the middle parts.  John Puller could be my new favorite Baldacci character.  Illustrates the rural coal-mining area of West Virginia with great pictures of what it must be like to live there.  Lots of surprises, which we have come to expect from Baldacci.
B004KKX80A|5.0|Got it for my son, one of his best beys! Eventhough we had to wait more than the usual, he was anxious and it did not disappoint!
B0088TG252|4.0|Typical story fo ex-CIA agent with someone inside the organization trying to get him.  Denzel W. turns in superb performance.  Scene in drug store is very memorable.  Lots of shoot outs and stuff getting blown up:  my kind of flick.

B000LTAY1U|2.0|Nice watch but really small. Basically a chicks watch. Also the one I had was making a rattling noise when I moved my arm. Not sure if that's because it's an automatic.

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Great family movie!! Fun for the whole family. Definitely recommend for movie night. Kids of all ages will love this movie!
B000TRSAAG|5.0|Music is hard to review, but I really like it. I think you will, too! I'm going to buy more of this artist!
B005LAIHR2|2.0|We had seen the stage show and felt it was outrageously wonderful.The music was from our era we rocked the night away and the story line was cool.So we were really excited to see how it would be captured on film.The music was there but the magic and spark  was gone. I am not a hugh fan of Tom Cruise but I think he was ok with his part but some of my favorite actors were in this but, they just seemed to be miscast and just muddled thru it. There were one or two little segments that were a bit fun and that is why I gave it two stars instead one. We really wanted to enjoy the big guns of this movie but all it did for us was to shoot blanks
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is awesome whenever I have free time I love playing it. I can never put it down. it is totally awsome
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|so glad that i purchased this cd.  the songs vary so it isnt all like &#34;the a team&#34; which i like.  great voice and nice lyrics.

B009PNQUXO|1.0|Only lets you see &quot;top videos&quot;.<br />Bizarre.<br />Agree that something fishy is up with this app.<br />Clicked on a video and got a message that &quot;links are being downloaded.&quot;<br />Something is not right hete.

B008NABUU8|5.0|Build bridges to get cars and trucks from one side of a chasm to another.  Watching vehicles plunge into the abyss adds a little fun to the failures - and you will fail.  Challenging and entertaining brain teaser.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Life is too short and I have too many books to read to waste my time on this boring book. Just glad I got it from the library.
B00498TQV8|4.0|Good watch. Not a whole lot of mystery though. The plot never does get into any kind of suspense or anything. Just a casual watch if you are too bored. Good one that depicts remote Ozark mountains and so forth.
B0026S1XD2|3.0|LOVELY, DIFFERENT BELL SOUND. BOUGHT ONE FOR A GIFT AND WAS WELL RECEIVED.  GOOD FOR WALKING AND<br />RELAXING IN A RECLINER
1451695195|5.0|This is an incredible and beautiful recounting of a near death experience.  Hearing it read by the author has made it an all time favorite for me.  I have listened to parts of it many times.  If you have questions about life after death, this book may provide some answers.  It is totally believable.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|i barely see my kids anymore because of this game. they love it. easy enough for my 4 yr old and challenging enough for my 9 year old.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Hands down, Garth Nix has to be my all-time favorite author no matter which series of his I am reading. Sabriel, book one of the Abhorsen series, stands out as the one book I never get tired of reading again. Garth Nix has an uncanny ability of creating a universe for each of his books that is unlike anything I have seen before. His writing effectively immerses you in a world that you have never seen or imagined, and Sabriel's combination of magic-use and necromancy feels so very unique.<br /><br />What I love best about any Garth Nix book is that, from series to series, nothing is recycled. You get a whole new universe to learn about and explore. Sabriel is well-worth the read, as is any creation by this author. I feel that Sabriel is an especially strong female role-model for any young woman to enjoy reading about as she is thrust into a dangerous world of the Undead and the necromancers who control them.<br /><br />If you want something novel and unlike anything you have read before, give Sabriel a try. If you love it, there's plenty more where that came from.
B00961ZGQC|5.0|This little tune seems to be right on the mark for what it was trying to accomplish. Upbeat pop music for when you don't want anything serious. Good stuff.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I have read this book several times because it really is a great young romance read.  I loved all the drama between Travis and Abby.  I thought it was cute that he was the \\"star\\" of college, basically...however completely unrealistic that is.  One thing I didn't enjoy about this book is the emphasis on fighting.  Although I think the author did a good job of describing what could go wrong, I think it is romanticized a little too much in the book, and I wonder what type of impression that leaves on younger adults who are reading this.  Another part I didn't enjoy was Abby's stubbornness when it came to forgiving Travis and getting back together with him over Thanksgiving.  I mean...to say toward the end of the book that she was ready to be back with him during that holiday and basically saying that she tortured him on purpose because she couldn't get over her own pride, I thought was pretty immature and cruel.  I didn't think that really did much for the story as a whole.  I think that's the one part of the book that really frustrated me.  Those two things were enough to downgrade the book, for me, from four starts to three, though, and as it seems with most books, I hate not knowing what happens next!  I thought it was really cute that they got married in the end, but I wish there had been more.  I look forward to reading this same book from Travis's point of view.  The more books I read, the more I wish that authors would alternate viewpoints in between chapters.  I think it really adds a lot more depth to the story.  That's not to say that I want every chapter repeated because that's a little too much and that doesn't add more to the story.  I am interested to see what the author does with a different point of view.
B009OA57MI|1.0|This app was fun at first but lagged. I figured I could deal with it and I could. Then it made my kindle freeze and go black. it did this twice. TWICE!!! It took forever to get back on. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!
0757302661|2.0|I wanted a ntural birth experience but found the bradley method book to be much more helpful in my opinion.

B009VSW15Y|5.0|Perfect for your kindle fire  but it does kind of stink because your kindle fire does no come with it though.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run is a really fun game its really fun and addicting I always play it!! AWESOME GAME
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|One of the great voices of today and great material.  My only caveat was I don't think Donny Osmond was the best<br />choice for &#34;All I ask of You&#34;, especially after hearing her sing &#34;Music of the Night:&#34; with Michael Crawford!
B00000GAIW|5.0|Jethro Tull, a great flute player, self taught, 70's rockers, with some unforgettable lyrics, that stick in your head forever
B009D5VPTI|5.0|Great Family Entertainment.<br />Awesome HD  Quality.<br />Good Story line.<br /><br />This is a movie that is a must watch for all ages !
B000002J0B|5.0|I remember listening to this album as a kid, brings back some good memories, something everyone should have if you loved the 70's rock.
B005EK4CHI|4.0|Considering this was new in 1991 and all the original remasters that came out in that year I always thought the mastering was a bit &#34;flat&#34; for the time.  Dynamic range was fine but some of the more &#34;bombastic&#34; moments were held back too much, as if Roger were smashing the drums but he hoped he didn't hurt them.  In this remastering, the full range of emotion of the sound is brought back without feeling like the whole album had been remixed as well.  As a result, a lot of the more acoustic moments of the studio come out in the mix and I heard new subtleties in tones I hadn't noticed before, e.g. the sibilance of a cymbal crash lasts longer.  John's bass sounds louder.  Brian's effects sound more electronic, ironically, but you feel more like you're hearing them out of his amp in the studio.  Freddie's vocals are the best they could have been at the time.<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks, well, they're worth it.  I'll just say that.  Everything could have been fit onto one disc.  No need for a second, so I'm glad I didn't buy this when it first came out and the price came way down.
0140074317|5.0|I bought this book for my Autistic son for his 28th birthday. He loves it,  he loves anything christmas. Not just gifts.
B004SGWYVA|3.0|This anime reinvent the wheel of resident evil, watching this is like watching resident evil in anime format.<br />Resident Evil itself failed as a horror movie, it was not scary, it was not great, it's average at best.<br />This anime follow the footstep of an average action/horror movie series resident evil is bound to fail.<br /><br />Let's take a look at my unbiased rating for this anime:<br /><br />1. Does this anime exploit nudity to get viewer's attention? No, it doesn't (-0 star)<br /><br />2. Story line: Average, very non-creative and lack of imagination. It's a copycat of Resident Evil series. Okay, because I am unbiased, I'll only -2 stars on this category.<br />Those of you who saw all the Resident Evil movies like me, you will hate this anime, and you will get sick of it after few episodes.<br />I have watched anime that rated 1star, 2star, 3star, 4star, 5stars, whether the anime was really really bad or really really good, I finished watching all the episodes of them, but this one is an exception, this is the first anime that I starts to watch then gave up after 4 episodes.<br /><br />Advice: This anime is not for kids, it has alot of violence and blood. If you are an mature audience, then you most likely have watched all the Resident Evils, so you will struggle if you watch this anime. If you have been living in a cave and don't know what Resident Evil is, then it might be okay for you to watch it.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This anime deserve an unbiased rating of 3star, only recommended for viewers that don't know what Resident Evil is.<br />A bias rating of this anime from someone who saw all the Resident Evil movies and thought Resident Evil was only average: will give this anime a 1star.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zepplin is a group that has help on for many decades, one of those 70's rock groups that never gets old
B007T99ENE|4.0|Most interesting scenario. Ian McEwan's characters really come alive and the book is beautifully written.I would ahve preferred Serena to be a bit more accomplished though.
1451683405|5.0|There seem to be a lot of misconceptions floating around in the negative reviews, many involving semantics.<br /><br />A straightforward distillation of Sam Harris' thesis might be:<br /><br />\\"You're free to choose what you want... but you're not free to choose what you WANT to want.\\"<br /><br />If that thought starts your mind turning then this is a book for you.
0345803507|5.0|I love the Fifty Shades Trilogy...it's so erotic and exciting...I'd definitely recommend this book to all women (and their husbands/boyfriends)
B004U52VPS|4.0|Was just as i expected it to be.  Bought as a gift and hopefully will bring down the number of times a day I have to hand my phone over for her to play angry birds.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author and I had a hard time putting it down.  Great characters, great dialogue, great story.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|Great delivery and the product was first rate, Fully met my expectations in all aspects.  I would recommend this company to others.
B008476HBM|5.0|My all-time favorite book. This story never gets old. Austen is the master when it comes to writing about love of the purest kind. Do yourself a favor and keep this in rotation in your library.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|After struggling a little bit with the first few chapters,I think because he was introducing so many new characters , then I could not put this book down , which caused a lot of problems given how long the book is! I wish it had been longer! Thank God there are sequels!
B0090NNQX6|5.0|You have to love Mika, right? He's a wonderful performer and songwriter and human being. So it's great to get an album with lots of great songs and Mika's unique voice.<br /><br />I wish that the songs did more to make his voice clear. So many of the songs have his voice overwhelmed by layers of sonic mud that obscure his singing and his vocal personality.  It's a shame.<br /><br />I also think the songwriting on the previous album was much cleaner and tighter.<br /><br />Standouts for me are Overrated and Step With Me.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I almost didn't bother to watch this movie because of all the bad reviews which I think were mainly based on personal bias for Kristin Stewart...good grief.  My son told me he and his girlfriend thought it was great and I should give it a try.  Glad I did, I thoroughly enjoyed it and it kept me a bit spellbound throughout.  ALL the actors did a terrific job...believe me, you will really hate that Queen!<br /><br />If you have been influenced by the bad reviews, my advice is to give this movie a go...I don't think you will regret it.  Special effects were amazing...totally beautiful movie.  I don't regret spending the money.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought this book had some very good moments with straightforward language and thoughts that were very insightful.  I was however, dissapointed by the twist at the end which I found to be unneccessary.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|it was a hudge life savor when i had a auddistoin and needed just the music to a song.<br />Thanks Youtube Mate!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a very good read.  It has less way out there action but puts together a believable story with enough twists to keep you turning pages.  This is the best Flynn in quite awhile.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|Brief summary<br />Thomas and his friends made it out of the maze and were saved by some people who took them to safety, but they soon find out that their relief is short lived because not only are they about to set out on another trial, they're also going to have to travel through a city full of Cranks to reach the end.<br /><br />What I liked<br />Oh so much! I love Thomas and his friends. There were moments where my heart started racing because I was so scared for these characters that I've become so attached to. The plot is good and the characters are awesome :)<br /><br />What I didn't like<br />Not much. I wish things would have played out a little differently with Teresa, but I think I understand why things had to happen the way they did, even if Thomas didn't. I expected the girls group to act a little differently, maybe more hostile or something, towards Thomas and his group, though I can't actually say that I didn't like that. It just wasn't what I expected.<br /><br />Brief thoughts<br />I love this series so far. This book was constantly moving just like The Maze Runner. I can't wait to finally know why WICKED set up the trials! On to The Death Cure! :D
034580404X|1.0|My daughter, in a moment of mischief, suggested this book. Since I had not read any reviews, I thought &#34;may as well order the trilogy, she knows my taste and if she recommends it ....must be good&#34;. Ka-Ka! I am too embarrassed to even give them away. Garbage pick-up is tomorrow.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Brief summary<br />Thomas knows that he can't trust WICKED, but WICKED is claiming that they're done with the trials and now they just need to put together all of their information to see which candidate will most likely lead them to the cure. But Thomas and the Gladers are done with Wicked and will stop at nothing to get their freedom.<br /><br />What I liked<br />***SPOILER ALERT*** I liked that they finally took Wicked down, even if it wasn't really Thomas's group that did it. I was really happy that they found a safe place to live, though I would have liked a little more information about where they were (and island maybe?). ***END SPOILER***<br /><br />What I didn't like<br />I didn't like that we don't get the answers I've been waiting for since the very beginning. I wanted to know all of Thomas's memories, specifically why he helped create the trials. I was really disappointed with that and it's why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5. ***BIG SPOILER ALERT*** I hate what happened to Newt and Teresa! Noooooooo!!! I wanted Thomas and Teresa to kiss and make up. That made me so sad. And Newt. Oh Newt. :( ***END SPOILER***<br /><br />Brief thoughts<br />This book was not quite as good as the first two in my opinion, but I still enjoyed it. I just wish we would have been given a little more information. That ending really threw me for a loop though! That was terrible, but not at all surprising when you really think about it. I'm going to read The Kill Order now to see how it all began.
B0075LTOR2|1.0|Save your money! The audio quality of the re-issue is absolutely horrible!!! Listened through every disc & the other reviews that write about how bad the audio quality is are spot on. Just another money grab from the record label. Don't Be A Sucker.
0385742886|5.0|Brief summary<br />Before the Maze, before the Scorch, before WICKED was even formed, came the sun flares that changed the world as we know it. Mark and Trina survived what they thought was the worst thing to ever happen to the world, but are now faced with a devastating disease that is ravaging the United States. They, along with some friends, are determined to find the cure that must be out there somewhere and to do that they need to find the people who started it all.<br /><br />What I liked<br />I really wanted to know what happened in the beginning after the world went to hell in a handbasket and this book definitely gives you that. People can be terrifying when they're desperate and I felt every emotion that was running through Mark. This book had my heart pounding from beginning to end.<br /><br />What I didn't like<br />***SPOILER ALERT***Since I've already read the first 3 books in this series, I already knew that there was no hope, no future for Mark, Trina, Alec, Lana, the Toad and Misty. That really had me bummed out, but even though it made me really sad, I really think this book contributes to the series. I do wish that we would have been told that DeeDee turned out to be Teresa. I'm assuming that it was her, but I wish I would have known for sure. It would have been nice if the epilogue would have been about WICKED renaming her to Teresa and her meeting Thomas. I didn't feel it was necessary to have the end be about him. We already knew that part of the story. ***END SPOILER***<br /><br />Brief thoughts<br />I liked finding out how it all began and I would definitely recommend reading this book. I don't think it would hurt to read this one before The Maze Runner, The Scorch Trials and The Death Cure, but I would recommend reading it last. I liked reading it the way I did.
0425263916|5.0|Loved her first book, definitely cannot wait until the 3rd & final book! This 2nd book was SO worth the wait!
0525421033|5.0|Brief summary<br />Seventeen year old Mia is riding in her parent's car to go visit some family friends and then in the blink of an eye she's standing next to her body that's been critically injured in a car accident. Taking place over the course of about 24 hours, this book is about love, loss and a choice that is Mia's alone to make.<br /><br />What I liked<br />This book was heartbreaking, but beautiful. I loved Mia. I felt so connected to her while reading about her current situation and her past. (view spoiler) I really don't know what to say to do this book justice. Maybe just that it's beautifully written and well worth reading.<br /><br />What I didn't like<br />I wasn't expecting it to end as abruptly as it did, but it doesn't bother me as much as it would have if there wasn't a second book to read. If it would have ended like that with no sequel then I would have been really upset.<br /><br />Brief thoughts<br />I'm not a fan of sad books at all (I seriously HATE to cry), but this is absolutely a book worth reading, even for someone like me. I will definitely read Where She Went as soon as I can get my hands on a copy. I'll just have to remember to keep a box of tissues handy.(
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book easy read for adults only for sure!  Love being able to download and read right away! Thank you
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cord is longer than others which makes it easier to use while I'm charging my Kindle. And I bought the powerfast charger to go with it. So, my Kindle Fire charges completely in less than 2 hours versus the regular 5 or 6 hours.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good book. I love Gidean. A little predictable but I still really enjoyed the story line.  Looking forward to the third book as well as her other book ideas.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This show is one of the best on television.  The time slot has moved opposite another popular show which hopefully won't hurt it's ratings.  The cast is top rate, the acting is understated, and the story line is fascinating as always as the law firm of Lockhart Gardner battles bankruptcy.
034580404X|5.0|These are by far the best 3 books I have ever read! I loved them so much that I bought this for my sister as well and she is obsessed now!!! Truly a one of a kind author!!!

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I procrastinated in buying a case for my kindle fire.  I am not sure why especially now that I have this one.  I absolutely love this case.  I have the black one.  I love that it has the option to be able to set it up.
B00AE2I4WK|1.0|Not much thought was put into this movie.  It was thrown together with a lame plot, people dancing and towards the end with the happy music playing as the \\"The Mob\\" gets what they wanted towards the end.. their neighborhood back. So the idea of once you live in an area,that is rented, it belongs to you?  No it doesn't.  It's being rented.  Whomever owns it can sell it any time they wish to do so.  They own it. So the day is saved because of booty popping and a lot of other dance moves?!!? Why?
B006GKHE6G|4.0|This game was downloaded to my kindle fire by my son.  He loves it.  He is 7 years old and loves to race the jet skis.  I have to say it has some pretty good graphics.
0316017930|5.0|Very well written book. If you read the first chapter you get the drift. After that, it's more of the same...
B003S897U0|4.0|After The Black Crowes five year hiatus, they made a triumphant return with \\"Live at Fillmore\\", \\"War Paint\\" & the classic \\"Before the Frost\\", so it seems strange that they would shoot themselves in the foot with this acoustic-live in the studio album.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable listen, with interesting expanded versions of songs such as \\"Wiser Time\\" & \\"Thorn in my Pride\\", but with the release of \\"Frost\\" & \\"Fillmore\\", The Crowes seemed to have over-egged the live album pudding. Plus it strange that there's no audience, with is like oxygen to band like The Black Crowes, & could have turn this performance into something quite memorable.<br />Also with the release of the two new outstanding studio Albums by Chris Robinson in 2012, I think we should all agree never to mention this record again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|and interesting! I loved the style and the story and the 2-persons narrative. Brilliant. Go Gillian, you are good! More, please.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I downloaded this as the faotd...it didn't take me long to play the full game but it did indeed seem to be the full game which was great!<br />really pretty graphics and interesting storyline.  it only took me a few hours to finish it, but that's because there is a lot of back and forth stuff.  I think that is the only downfall - but it isn't horrible.<br />I'd recommend this game...hope you enjoy!
0553805371|5.0|Believe it or not, these two are hilarious, their writing styles complimentary and informative and despite some massive ideas to deal with, make the process enjoyable and at the very least comprehendible. Actually understanding what the hell is going on is something else altogether. But you will laugh, sometimes with them, sometimes at the sheer brilliance and complexity.<br />Enjoy the ride.

0061474355|5.0|This book is a ridiculously fun read. I was loaned it by a friend when I was younger. After reading it, I immediately went out and bought the other two - it's that kind of good. I won't get too detailed, but here's the short and sweet version of what I like about this series:<br />1. Absolutely amazing world - the places are just so fascinating and wonderfully rendered. Not only could I imagine the world being described perfectly, I wanted to go there and see it for myself.<br />2. Haunting writing - when I read about the journeys into death and the wind pipes at the border, I got the chills.<br />3. This story will stay with you forever. It's the kind of story that finds a home in your heart. I will never, ever forget this series or anything else written by this author, and I will never regret the time I spent reading and re-reading these books. Try them out, you won't either.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My husband and I both love this movie as much, if not more than our 2 1/2 yr old daughter... and she adores it! She sings along to every song and cracks up over Paskell and Maximus.  The voices are nothing short of amazing and as usual, Disney is brilliant in bringing such life and personality to all characters... especially the animals who have no real dialogue outside of facial expressions and body language.  Don't miss this one!
B00006I53S|3.0|I initially bought this lens in August 2007 for my Rebel XT.  It has served as my primary lens ever since.<br />The Good:<br />Useful focal length for a general walkabout.  First generation IS was awesome when it came out.  The price was reasonable, and it is much better then the old kit lenses, which did not have IS.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />I just bought a 60D in November 2012.  The lens is now five years old.  With the lens on the 60D, I am a disappointed at how soft it is.  (Caveat, I tend to pixel peep.)  I am not sure if the lens is just worn out, or if the higher megapixel count in the 60D is exposing how soft the lens has always been.  What really gets me however is the older IS \\"jumps\\" after every focus movement.  This makes live view on the 60D almost impossible with the IS turned on, as the 60D cannot seem to compensate for the jumping picture.  (Turn IS off, and the live view autofocus works OK, however we buy IS lenses for a reason, right?)<br /><br />Compare this to newer generations of IS, such as the [[ASIN:B0007Y794O Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR Cameras]] and the IS / Live View / 60D combination are perfectly happy together.<br /><br />The Other:<br />My copy of the lens has always \\"flopped\\" about - however I haven't noticed this to produce to much impact on photos.  The lens has accumulated a little dust inside, but nothing that I would say is serious.  It weathered a rainy day inside a grocery bag (stopped working in the afternoon, but resumed working after drying out.)<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />If I was looking now for a lens, I would pass on this lens for something with a newer generation IS.

B003JYOEYM|2.0|I enjoy good horror movies.  There are some good zombie movies out there but this wasn't one of them.  Looked more of a really bad B-movie rather than a work to be taken seriously.  Pick another zombie movie and watch it instead of this one

0763644765|5.0|My husband and I both thought this book was a little strange, but the kids all loved it (aged 8, 6, 1).  Very quickly it became the 1 yr old's fave book and she memorized it and would &#34;read&#34; it to us, expressions and all.  We eventually realized that we adults thought it was strange for the very same reasons the kids loved it, it was expressive and left some pictures to the imagination... just the way a kid's book should be.  It helped hugely when our almost 2 yr old was ready to try the potty.  We have probably read this book over a thousand times, seriously.

B0052BZ6X8|5.0|This was a good movie to watch with the parents for movie night. It had a good story and there wasn't too much violence for the mother-in-law. Hoping they make another one.
0525478817|5.0|In what has been a record setting year for me in terms of total books read, there have been a couple of real stand outs. \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\" by John Green is not only one of the best of this year's books, it is now on my list of all time favorites. The story is about two kids that meet in a cancer support group. I don't want to say much more because I wouldn't want to wreck a second of it for anyone who is interested in reading it. It's sad, it's funny, very thought provoking and the dialogue is top notch. If you need something to read, give it a try.

B00AF8FIOK|5.0|I've seen every episode of Supernatural and I'm very excited to see them continuing the story. They are doing a great job of getting involved with each character in every episode. Sam and Dean are great role models for what they believe is right and I like how they never let that go. I hope to see more seasons in the future.

Tried re-starting the Kindle Fire just to be sure, but just keeps going back to my home page after the 2nd introduction page.<br /><br />Seems a shame since so many people like it.

0062183591|5.0|t\\"<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Dan Ariely's work and this book continues of his tradition of things that make you go \\"hmmmm.\\"<br /><br />The focus of this book is the idea that people consciously or unconsciously nudge the truth in order to match an outcome they want.  Give people room to cheat and they'll cheat just a little.  Frequently it isn't because people want to but when you give someone a financial incentive without a proper safeguard in place, they are likely to fudge just a little.  That dinner becomes a bit more tax deductible, the MD that orders a procedure that helps pay for the million dollar machine, or simply answering an IQ test and \\"accidentally\\" seeing the answers.<br /><br />Typical of Dan, his conclusions are painstakingly researched and very well reasoned.  Personally I often struggle with removing bias in decisions I make for myself and my clients and I was delighted to know I'm not over thinking all this.  Once a financial incentive comes into play, one must actively work to recognize bias and reduce it for the best interest of everyone.<br /><br />In particular, Dan makes direct suggestions on how to reduce some of these problems.  I loved his suggestions to and rejections by the IRS.  Not only is Dan smart but he is wicked funny and a pure delight to read.<br /><br />Anyone who makes decisions needs to read this book.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|So many people have complained about this film working on a tired formula. To an extent, that's true. However, it does something very different - and important - with its characters. In addition to the usual rebellious princess (Merida) who enjoys activities such as horseback riding and archery, another central character in the film is her mother, Queen Elinor. Elinor is trying to train her daughter to be a princess, and later, queen herself. However, Merida resists this education, viewing it as too restrictive.<br /><br />The exploration of the mother/daughter relationship is the most interesting part of the movie, as it does not paint either of them as completely wrong: far too often movies like this have the strict authority figure featured as nothing more than a challenge for the character. Brave, however, makes it clear that Elinor has valid reasons for her actions. Also, it shows that Elinor herself is every bit as strong as Merida, even if she is a much more reserved, elegant figure. She shows and uses her strength in different ways.<br /><br />Merida is able to learn something from her mother, and we see a wonderful case of conflict resolution (there's some fighting later, for those who want it, but I thought that wasn't as interesting), in which Merida has to think and speak, bringing what she learned from her mother to use while applying her own views. She didn't have to give up any agency, she just gained a new way to use it.<br /><br />I guess the short version: I'm so glad to see a movie that doesn't treat feminine things as weaker than masculine ones. This movie shows the strength in both traditionally feminine and traditionally masculine activities.<br /><br />Most of the humor is rather \\"meh\\" in the second half, and one major plot twist isn't adequately explained.<br /><br />But it's a very good movie overall, and not to be missed!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|when i have a few minutes, i fire up flow free. the 8x8 and 9x9 can be challenging and the smaller ones are quick brain exercise.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is a fun game.  it does take a while to evolve and hatch and grow food but over all the game is good.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|Downloaded as a Freebie.  Would work fine, then crash.  I'd restart then it'd crash again.  Tried to restart after the second crash and got an error screen saying \\"This application encountered a Lua error (see logs) or has been corrupted.\\"  and got the same message every time I tried to start it again.  I uninstalled, then reinstalled and I got a bit farther before I got the same error message (again, after it crashed 2-3 times).  Not sure what the problem is.  I also agree with the reviewer who indicated a tutorial sheet would be a good addition.  I'm giving it two stars because while it was running it was great!  I just wish I could finish it before it crashes and burns!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I absolutley love this game! I love the challenge of it and its very fun! it has to be my favorite game I have downloaded!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|For a sequel, it was full of humor, action and no disappointments! It's worthy of watching 2 or 3 or 4 times to catch all the bits.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The story line of the book is great! But it is very poorly written. The dialogue is very minimum,  and doesn't explain. Things well. Hopefully the movies are better!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|The story was interesting and brought up some good questions about humanity, where we come from, our purpose, and all the similar large questions we've been asking ourselves for as long the first smart monkey thought of it but in a new way.<br /><br />Also some of the graphics, views, designs etc were fantastic -really interesting and well done.<br /><br />All let down by a completely cliche cast of characters with bad acting.<br />Really Ridley?<br />The cigar-chomping fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants captain.<br />The corporate cold heart who changes the deal at the last minute on the naive scientists.<br />(one of the scientists looks like a model - with a 3 day beard at all times...hmm, when they're not a cliche the casting goes the exact opposite)<br />And what REALLY was annoying - the one nutjob geologist. It's hard to fall into the story of any movie and it's nearly impossible to 'temporarily suspend disbelief' with such an imbecilic character. The man is a scottish yobbo- tall, skinny, half shaved head with tattoo's on it while he's 'just in this for the money'...besides being and surly all the time. You wouldn't want him to date a sister- even one you didn't like, let alone hire him on a two year mission that was claimed to cost one trillion dollars. Apparently the trillion didn't include any line items for human resources. I mean, if I walked into McDonalds and he was behind the counter, I'd think the manager was an idiot for hiring him.<br />Really Ridley? Really? You expect anyone to believe that?<br />There was also the compete lack of scientific or safety protocols in, well, anything, scientists who acted like 14 year olds, and a host of other ridiculous discontinuities.<br />The one good character wasn't even human (zee android)- I did really enjoy how he kept channelling TE Lawrence and he was believable.<br />If all of the characters were of a quality of that nature, the film would have so much improved.<br /><br />Basically:<br />It's a train wreck. Worth a watch if you're interested in the whole Aliens genre/universe or just interesting high budget SF, but pass on it otherwise. If you get confused by movies with waaaay too much going on, or want answers to all the questions, don't watch this.<br />Still, since it left so many questions unanswered, I'll watch a sequel (if they even bother to make one, it was no runaway market success) - after it comes out on Amazon video of course...
B008133DO8|5.0|Cumberbatch/Moffat Sherlock parrying with a dominatrix; it's the kind of thing where you may build up certain expectations if you were to pick up and read the back of it at a Blockbuster, and still have them exceeded as a matter of course.<br /><br />I highly recommend this episode, I went and sought it out because we were moving at the time it aired on PBS and I had missed it on my season pass. It was worth the search.

B0014JKJJI|2.0|If you're looking for a wider-toe work shoe, this is the shoe for you. I had to go with the Mercy style though: unlike the Bistro, it has a smaller, more traditionally-sized toe; the Bistro fits regular everywhere except the front, where it kind of juts out in a Herman Munster kinda way.<br /><br />I'm sure once you wear the Bistro a bit, it will conform to your foot like the Mercy has to mine, becoming fairly comfortable. Though I prefer a little more cushion between my feet and the floor when I'm working, for the amount I paid the Mercy is getting the job done, and if you need a wider toe and don't mind a slight incline from heel to toe (to me, it was almost negligible), the Bistro could work for you.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|alright so The Walking Dead is the best show on TV for sure and the majority of folks will have to agree with me on that one. the thing I really like the most about this tv show is its all about the story and the character's which to me are  very believeable, lisen if you havent watched season 1 you need to like now.

B000HKW7E0|2.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years and remembered it as much more funny compared to now. Then again the first time I saw it was as a young adult and about the time it was originally released. Chevy Chase was not too far removed from his SNL days (relatively) and still fairly popular. Now I guess with time I found the movie just silly and not particularly funny or entertaining. Lots of campy humor, too many close-ups of Chevy Chase's goofy wide-eyed look that became more irritating than funny, and several instances of foul language and sexual innuendo which I found uncomfortable to sit through with my 12 going on 13-year old son. There are some genuinely funny scenes, but by the end I was quite disappointed. I also suggest parents of early teen and younger kids may want to screen this PG-13 film first as the rating recommends before deciding to share it with the younger ones.

B0040UAYI4|5.0|When I was young, I thoroughly enjoyed one of the greatest multiplayer FPS games ever released on a console: Goldeneye.  I was an absolute killer on the Nintendo 64 while playing this game, much to the frustration of my friends.  Fast forward a few years, and I had moved onto PC gaming and realized how superior FPS games were with mouse and keyboard.  As a result, my talent for console FPS games has slipped to embarrassing levels.  In other words, I can't hit the broad side of a barn using a console controller.<br /><br />Recently I purchased a PS3 so that I could begin gaming with my best bud from the Air Force, since he keeps delaying the purchase of a new PC that will allow him to play current titles.  Having logged hundreds of hours playing BF1942 together, our game of choice on the PS3 is BF3.  After several play sessions, my frustration at my inability to aim effectively using a console controller was threatening to result in said controller becoming embedded in my 50 inch TV.  To avoid a rage-induced stroke, I turned to the internet for a solution, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This device allows you to use a mouse and keyboard on either the PS3 or 360, depending on the model you buy.  I was a bit leery about purchasing it, since a few of the reviews mentioned problems with input lag.  Having used it for several hours last night, I have to say it is one of the single best gaming purchases I have ever made.  I had zero problems with input lag, and once I took the time to get it calibrated just right, the results were amazing.  I went from frequently being in last place with a horrible KDR to a chart topper overnight.  During my first play session, I was MVP in about half of my matches, and was never less than top three on my team.<br /><br />The Eagle Eye doesn't turn you into an unstoppable killing machine or give you a completely unfair advantage.  It is not the same as using a mouse on a PC, since the analog input of a console limits how responsiveit can be, but it is darn close once tweaked just right.  What it allows you to do is actually utilize those muscle memories and habits you have honed in PC FPS games, instead of struggling to adapt to a console controller.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product enough for anyone who has similar troubles with console FPS games.
B0080K3G4O|5.0|I am an unabashed realist.  It sets my teeth on edge when people proclaim \\"you can do anything!\\", \\"why are you depressed?  Just choose to be happy!\\", \\"Everything will be OK\\" because I'm sure they're all delusional.<br /><br />This book provides insight on dealing with the world DESPITE the delusions of these people.  It's not that the world is fluffy and comfortable, but our response to the \\"slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\\" can help us manage.  Well written and based on the authors explorations and personal experiences.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Sensational novel! This truly is a psychological thriller if ever there was one. Unlike typical \\"who dunit\\" stories where the author leads you in one direction then the next, this story just flowed easily and without interruption. I read A LOT, so usually before the 'mystery' is revealed I've already solved the case and know exactly where the story leads - that is most definitely not the case here. There were more twists and turns in this tale than on my favorite roller coaster. I COULD NOT figure this out, not completely anyway, even up until the last page. I really do not understand any of the negative reviews unless they come from people that aren't avid readers or readers of this genre. I can not recommend this enough. I suggest for anyone that just loves a good book to grab this one quick. In my opinion this definitely is a must read for everyone.

It also talks about his life before and afterwards. I really enjoyed the writing; it was much better than in The Satanic Verses and The Enchantress of Florence, both of which, looking back, were rather dense. The writing here may not have been dense, but the actual book was. I was really enjoying it about 200 pages in, but the whole book is over 600 pages, and I just couldn't see where it was going to develop. It is a bit plodding, but I still liked it, though it probably could have been trimmed down a lot in the middle.<br /><br />It was really interesting to read more in-depth about the fatwa, though. A lot of the fanatics hadn't even read the book, and they were still calling it heretic and evil. It was interesting to see the two people: Salman, how he thought of himself, and Rushdie, the public persona revered and despised by so many.<br /><br />Some might find the literary and publishing politics detailed in the book a bit tedious, but I enjoyed reading about what the negotiations were like. Penguin/Viking had published The Satanic Verses, but they were reluctant to publish Haroun and the Sea of Stories at first, because of the controversy.<br /><br />As I said, the writing here was really compelling, and distinctive too. Rushdie wrote about himself in the third person as \\"he\\" or \\"the writer\\". It was totally different from most memoirs, and once you got used to it, had a certain flow. The title refers to the alias he developed for himself, from two of his favorite writers, Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov. Rushdie drops a lot of big names casually: Graham Greene, Saul Bellow, Dorris Lessing, Norman Mailer and many more, all of whom he met. And Colin Firth. Let me repeat that: Colin Firth. At any rate, I realized again how much I really love his crazy, rambling style. I want to read Midnight's Children now, and reread Luka andthe Fire of Life, as well as Haroun and the Sea of Stories.<br /><br />I liked this memoir, despite its length, and would recommend it to anyone who loves Salman Rushdie's work. Stick through the middle sections.<br /><br />My reviews can all be read at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching season 1 and 2 on netflix and immediately got hooked.  This was the only way I could find to get caught up on season 3.  I'm thrilled that Amazon has this service!
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|It's not horrible but not that great either. A little long for the storyline. There were a couple gruesome acts, but I've seen worse in horror flicks.
B002NZTZ8S|1.0|This movie's catchword \\"Believe\\" defines the secularization of Christmas. Believe in what? Nothing, really. The magic of childhood imagination, narrated by a syrupy adult? A little boy has a Christmas Eve experience saturated in secular Christmas symbolism: a mysteriously beautiful train ride ending in the North Pole, snow, Santa, reindeer, a magic roller coaster ride through ice.<br /><br />It is clearly really happening and not an ambiguous hallucination, but despite the many proofs, the little boy - like secular adults confronted with Christian belief today - doubts and angrily refuses to believe any of it. Only at the end of the movie does he make an act of will and finally \\"believe\\", then he is rewarded with proof and a lifelong ability to \\"believe\\"... but his belief is in nothing bigger than his secular vision.<br /><br />I was disgusted by this, and by the wholesale subsequent adoption of \\"Believe\\" as a Christmas sentiment, when the entire purpose of the movie is to propose belief without any object, a vague nice feeling with no foundation, and a message that goes nowhere - a pat on the back for nothingness where something larger ought to be.<br /><br />I would still have given the movie two stars, because some of the animation is interesting and lovely, but most of it is not. I caught a copy-paste-loop effect many times. So, overall, I'm rating the movie on the plot and message, which I thought was ultimately false and shallow.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great Series!  Read the whole series in about one week, with working full time and two small children. ;)  Highly recommended!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|its real fun, and funny! tom copies whatever i said, in a squeaky voice! when i touch tom's stomach, he hold his stomach ( but not up in the air) and says, &quot; oooohhh&quot; in a sick kind of way. you can upload the things you recorded on facebook and youtube!i hope you will love this game!

B0076DELIG|5.0|I believe The Black Box is the best of Michael Connelly's extensive oeuvre, which now totals 24 novels, one collection of nonfiction, and some short stories.  Harry Bosch is soldiering on, this time picking up the tiniest of loose ends of a case that began during the Rodney King riots in 1992 Los Angeles. Bosch is working \\"cold cases,\\" in the LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit (fans will remember he's nearing mandatory retirement), and reopens the case of Anneke Jespersen, a freelance Danish foreign correspondent, ostensibly in the City of Angels to cover the rioting. Her murder was not pursued vigorously--no obvious clues, no obvious motive--and the city was engulfed in flames, its police forced stretched to the breaking point. But Bosch recovers a spent shell casing, and in 2012, the technology to link it to a gun brings the case to life.<br /><br />Connelly has fashioned a seamless but intricate puzzle of a book, and it hits the right notes consistently. From that tiny thread of evidence, he weaves a consistently intriguing tapestry of character, narrative and observation. At first glance, the book is a classic procedural, but Connelly's gift as a storyteller (if you like his work, you'll inhale this in a few big, deep draughts--and be sorry when it's over) enables \\"The Black Box\\" to transcend the notion of a genre novel. It is unmistakably great and undeniably compelling. It is also written with a dark and poetic sensibility, which will be familiar to Connelly's fans but seems to me even more distinctive and powerful in this book.<br /><br />I absolutely dread the day Bosch retires from the LAPD and hope that he hangs out his own PI shingle so I can continue to read about him and the cases that engage him.

0547884591|5.0|I am already a pretty accomplished cook, but a week into the 4 hour chef and I've learnt so much. Skills, ingredients, combinations.<br /><br />Tims style can be irritating, he drops a lotta names and rambles a bit, and I've skipped stuff which I'm sure ill return to, but I'm on lesson 5, and I am loving the journey he's taking me down.<br /><br />I have so many cook books, many if which I use, I'm a massive fan if Ottelenghi and Jamie and Rick Stein, but this is a different thing. He's teaching a system here, and while I'm not exactly sure how it where we are going I know I'm learning loads. I couldn't wait for my wife to go out tonight, so I could get cooking again.<br /><br />Cooked an amazing meal tonight, went off piste as I couldn't find crab and didn't have Harissa, but I used smoked mackerel and red Thai paste fit the fish cakes (recipe 5?) and I did the mashed cauliflower ( I used almonds as I didn't have cashews). It was awesome, my 9 year old daughter shared it with me and she loved it too.<br /><br />This book is packed with fascinating data, tips and cool recipes. I am very excited about working right the way through it.<br /><br />Thanks Tim so much for writing it and in doing so helping so many people eat more delicious, healthy food. The only concern I have is that I am concerned you may be adding to the population problem by  extending more lives as a result of their learning!<br /><br />My second review, first ever cook book review. But this isn't a cook book, this is a manual for living and learning. Thanks again Tim.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I just love Will Smith and all his movies are great. Enjoyed the MIB series and always want to see more. Hope there is another one soon.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I don't get tired of Michael Hall and the other cast members. They make the implausible Dexter believable. He is so awful and yet so easy to root for!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Up to date conditions on demand.  Like that I can set it to my zip code to check my weather but can put in any other zip code and see what's going on in that area.
B008CUVOKK|2.0|I read all five published books of this series.  The first four books were awesome.  The story lines DROVE me to each new book.  However, I am now looking for a TRUE SIXTH book!  The last book the series left us dangling on virtually every story line . . . as if George R.R. Martin is planning on writing another book to finish it all up.  If he does not write another book - he owes me for all the time that I wasted reading this series.  Imagine going to a movie that just ends with no conclusion.  As if the producer just ran out of money.  Remember your disappointment in the ending of Sopranos?  Try that times 10.  Awesome writing. Awesome character development. With NO resolution.  Until you see a TRUE SIXTH book, I would recommend that you do not waste your time.
1451695195|2.0|Have read similar NDE books but this one just did not touch me.<br />Technical and dry emotions that did not draw me in.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This movie is funny, both in the slapstick and also dark way. It has a fairly standard moral but on the other hand doesn't get too heavy-handed about it. Unfortunately, it's in that zone of films that are too-adult-for-kids and too-childish-for-adults, so it surprises parents with some fairly dark scenes and times that may be boring for children. But I liked it a lot.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|If you have a 240hz tv it's almost to good....can see all the details...even the heavy makup on the actors.

1451695187|5.0|This account of Life after death is different in that it is seen through the eyes of a neuro-surgeon,<br />and his fellow physicans..<br />His message is not primarily to promote his Christian faith..<br />however,<br />The Doctor's partially formed belief system, was developed and very enriched by this well written experience.<br />I read it in 2 settings......  very well presented.
B00881VLCE|5.0|i love having this app!!! space saver with so many options at your fingertips and at so many levels every age can play
B007SGM084|5.0|WONDERFUL books, ones that I would read over and over again!!  Way to go E. L. James.  Sexy and makes you think.... ; )
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Started watching this movie when it arrived in hopes for better.  The stupidity of the crew in almost every scene sequence made it impossible to buy into the story line in any amount.  That someone would mount what was billed in the early part of the movie as a fantastically expensive mission and staff the crew with idiots without a clue makes the entire plot ridiculous.  I finally turned it off when the idiot reached for the snake/alien.  Still haven't had any interest in even finishing the movie.  To be fair, I'm not a fear induced adreneline junkie, but have seen the Alien movies. I've even rewatched a couple, because Sigorney at least got you to buy into the situation.  You'd think if a movie was going to script a ship visiting the race that started mankind, it could make them look smart enough to have actually made it there.<br /><br />The movie industry has me as an easy mark for almost anything they put out in 3d, because I love it.  However, offerings like this one could eventually kill it off.  We need movies that will help support the format, not B grade scifi horror movies.  Compared to this movie, the 3D remake of I, Robot was a terrific bargain - half the price for 10 times the movie.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have always enjoyed this app and its numerous great features for organizing my devices.  I won't restate all the great features that have been already commented, but instead will focus on the latest update to the app.<br /><br />As of the time of this writing (Dec 2012) I can now say that this app is equally useful for both tablet use and phone use. The UI improvements that were recently made for tablets makes this app an absolutely joy to use.  The prior version was really friendly for use on my phone but wasn't quite as clean and professional looking on a tablet.<br /><br />The UI now supports searching on tablets (which previously was only possible on phones which a hardware search button).  This makes it so much easier to find something that you may have lost (I don't always classify features where they make the most sense).<br /><br />The UI now has a dedicated section for apps that are uncategorized so it is much easier to see what apps need work.<br /><br />The approach for categorizing apps is also much more workflow driven and works really nice.  Gone are the days where you had these clunky arrows to more things from one side selection area to another.  Also the new workflow does cause the UI to loose track of where you were in the process.  The screen no longer jumps around to new focus areas, it just adds and removes layers as needed.<br /><br />On my phone I never had these concerns because the phone interface worked differently.  Now I enjoy using the app on either platform.<br /><br />As for how I make the most of this app, here are a few of the things I do which aren't obvious ideas.<br />- I have Widgets on my phone and tablet for:<br />1) favorite folders<br />2) favorite apps<br />3) direct call section for my most used contacts (I can fit more via the widget than if I used phones grids)<br />4) direct email for my most used email contacts<br />5) direct text contacts for my most used contacts<br />6) I created an &quot;ignorable&quot; folder forapps which I have no desire to put in a category (Widgets or apps installed by hardware manufacturer)<br />7) I also have folders of folders.  This wasn't as obvious that it was available when I started with the app but it allows my to have a hierarchical display for things like games.  I can have folders like Strategy Games, and another for Card Games, etc and can then store these folders in a Games folder.<br /><br />To wrap up, this is the one app that gets used on all my devices every time I use it.  I can't say the same thing for anything else.  If only others in my family could use this app more to its potential, I wouldn't mind using one of their devices.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|i haven't played video games in a while... but this is a fun, addictive app.  The best part is that it was free.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Only about halfway through the season so far, however it is hands down the best season of this series yet.  It departs from the comics more in terms of particulars while still sticking to the overall storyline; however, I do not see this as a bad thing as I personally enjoy the show more than the comics, but even if you do not agree with me on that, it gives comic-readers a taste of the &#34;what will happen next&#34; vibe that can make a show like this so enticing.<br /><br />As for the streaming quality from Amazon, it is amazing to say the least.  I was unsure of what to expect given how poor the streaming quality from Netflix or Hulu+ can be (even when it's streaming in &#34;HD&#34;) (relative to an actual DVD or Blu Ray), however for Amazon there are few (if any) hiccups during the actual streaming, and the visual and audio quality of the streaming blows the other two services away.<br /><br />I highly recommend getting this product on its own merits, and I also highly recommend getting it via Amazon's Instant Video service if you do not want to wait for the physical media to come out (or you don't care about/want the physical media)
B000W9399S|5.0|I love these books.  Using whimsy and adorkable humor to make the reader feel for these outlandish characters. A great read every time
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is soo worh the money! its really fun and addicting. i love the fact that you can draw everything!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I love being able to buy my movies online and have instant access to them. The playback of this seemed as high quality as any blue ray I have on hand. I plan to buy more movies in this format.
B0095T3H2U|2.0|I'm not an unhappy person; I love to laugh. I get a big kick out of comedy, when I rent a comedy I expect to have a laugh; or a chuckle, or something maybe a smile? This movie was so incredibly unfunny I just had to get it off my chest and write a review. Whether anyone is helped by this review or even reads it doesn't really matter. The main thing is I got to spew about it. The story is boy meets girl, falls in love, asks girl to marry him, she agrees but has to move to Michigan from San Francisco for school. They move, they stifle each other, fight, break up. He moves back to San Fran opens a taco truck is a huge success has a dumb girlfriend who is too young for him and she moves in with her professor. It's all very boring. It's all way too long. It's not very funny. I like both the leads in this movie so I thought I'd give it a try. Let's hope they have moved on to better things.
B000MAOLVW|4.0|lots of nostalgia.<br /> great shots of tracks no longer used. plot was too mushy. cars were great. photography was good for the time it was shot.
0593065727|5.0|Great story, terrific Reacher, and better than the last.  Yes, there's a bit fewer fights, but more much more suspense.  The in-depth portrayal of the interwoven government agencies is vivid and believable.  The twists in who is really who they say will have you guessing to the end.  Reacher's revolving intimately around more characters, mostly women, in a more revealing way.  Reacher is still tough and uncompromising and it is shown amusingly and creatively.  The dialog is sharp.  Other than the timely intervention at the end for Reacher's sake, it is almost perfect.  Reacher is still getting better.  And you continue, after starting A Wanted Man, to not be able to put it down.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This movie was the most pretentious and stupid movie I have seen in a long time<br /><br />Ridley Scott (and his screenplay writers) should be banned from ever making movies again - an ego driven piece of junk<br /><br />He (and they) should retire
B008VBYN80|4.0|this is a great game.  used to play farmville a lot and this is better! my husband nd I play against eachother a lot
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app works on my phone &amp; kindle fire. The whole family enjoys playing. We're trying to see who can complete their collection first.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|It seems like a lot of these kinds of apps were designed to work with the original Android OS.  Amazon's modifications to Ice Cream Sandwich were a TERRIBLE idea that seems to cause crashes left and right.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is extremely addictive.  My mother and father got this game after they saw me playing it,  now we try to see who can beat the hard levels the fastest.
B009HELT3C|1.0|This movie is straight garbage on a sunny sidewalk in Queens in the summer.  I went from uneasy to queasy in less time than Will Arnet spent on screen.  Anyone entertained by this ought to swing by my place soon, I got a bran muffin making it's way through shortly.  Sure Josh Brolin was a nice addition but totally under utilized.  Will Smith looked more bored than the plot to be there.  His performance rivaled some of the recently arisen on the Walking Dead.  Someone thought, \\"sure, let's get the band back together one more time\\".  While the audience thought, \\"sure, how bad can it be?\\"  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Barry Sonnenfeld has stepped up to that challenge.  MIB3 makes SyFy originals look good.  I mean, have you Sharktopus?
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|The movie drags, there's a weird polygamous relationship, and the ending (both of them) is sort of a cop out.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Got this the day before a trip so plugged it up to the charger for the night. When I got to the airport and plugged in my headphones...nothing. Turns out a lot of these units were defective and I got one.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|It's alright.. I was expecting more.  I like Baldacci, but this one was unusually draggy for my taste.  I generally have trouble putting his books down but after the very beginning , this was a bit of a snooze and not his best work.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|This game wont run on kindle fire HD 8.9.<br /><br />I get past first two screens and game crashes to carousel
B00005J6RE|5.0|This item was used, but I didn't see any signs of that. There were no scratches on the DVD and it played just fine. The quality was better than VHS, but it did not look like it was remastered or anything like that. These episodes looked the same as when they aired on TV before they added those extra special effects several years ago. Good quality especially for the price.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of those books that grabs you from the start. I happen to be a dog lover but even someone who isn't a huge dog enthusiast would appreciate this book - in fact, they may even become inspired to go find a buddy like Enzo, themselves! The author has done a great job of depicting this story from a dog's perspective. It's heartfelt and noteworthy. Even though the events were told through a dog, the reader is able to connect to all the characters and feel their emotion. I'm telling all of my friends to read this book - it's just that good!
B009VB97EY|4.0|I wasn't sure about a movie about male strippers but Channing Tatum sure can dance.  Some of the movie was a bit corny and I have to say that some of the other dancers were pretty darn bad, but Channing and Matthew really put on a show.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a cute romance full of nicely done sex scenes.  It has a good plot with some twists to keep it from being too conventional.  Well worth the time to read.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|I was very disappointed in this remaster... The box came in damaged, because shipping carton had nearly no padding. One of the records had severe \\"no fill\\" issue, some others had excessive noise, pops and distortions. But from reading other people's comments, mine wasn't as bad. Rainbo pressing plant is really no good. I have to say though, that pressing 180 g records is more difficult than pressing regular weight, so they should have stuck to regular weight.<br /><br />Packaging itself is really good, including authentic labels on records, and the book. That's about it: the sound is very mediocre, not any better than the 2009 CD remasters, which I dislike. If you have a lot of good Beatles vinyl, such as UK, German and good Capitol (yes, there are some), like me, stay away from this one: sound is for the most part murky, boomy, hard, nasty in midrange, lacking all air and space... I wouldn't even compare it to LPs, it deserves comparison only to 2009 CDs and available MP3s. It is a nice souvenir, a cool collector's item, if you have extra $350 in your pocket. If you don't have ANY Beatles vinyl, and prefer this format to CD, and your system is not a highly resolving one, then it's OK...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I selected my rating based on how astonishing it was to read such excitement. I love the anxiety that builds as I continued to read. I will recommend this book to every man and woman.

B000VBJEFK|5.0|Great movie to have in your collection. Good story, good animation and the voice actors do a wonderful job. Buy it today.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved reading Dr. Alexander's experience! I myself already knew and know that heaven and God are for real! But reading his story and knowing that there are people that want proof about the after life and to have a brilliant doctor that can prove beyond scientific measures, the impossible is possible, is a testimony that I know he is suppose to share with the rest of us who will open our hearts and take it all in!!
B009DP9D6A|5.0|As an owner of a tuxedo cat, probably 30% of my purchase of this album revolved around the cover photo.  I do, however, also very much enjoy deadmau5.  This album is a nice mix of house, dub, and trance, with nothing being featured too heavily.  Definitely recommend!

B003TSEEDY|2.0|The author didn't address a serious subject of a disturbed adolescent with a very realistic<br />story . The end of the book was weak.

B008D28HYS|4.0|I have spent too many hours playing this game, it is really addictive. It is a bit problematic, even on a tablet, when there are lots of squares to be filled in, but that does make the game  more and more challenging. There is the option of the clues coming down with large arrows in the upper left when a puzzle has been zoomed big.<br /><br />I can't imagine doing this on a phone. It is difficult at times to mark in the correct spot(s). BTW, if you press until a circle appears, it will carry the current choice all along a row or column.<br /><br />I like that there are regular updates in most categories. There is a free version, but it is very limited. I haven't noticed ads, but it does beg occasionally for a rating, so here it is.<br /><br />I also have the regular Cross Me, which is fun for a change. I believe it was a FAOD, which got me hooked.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|This is an action packed movie.  It never slows down for a minutes and includes all of the old action stars.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|After buying this on a whim I have now read it twice, bought two more a gifts and recommended it to everyone who would listen.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|This is a very cute and entertaining movie.  Very funny.  You and your kids will love it.  I would definetly watch it again.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I am reading this book with my book club and can't wait to discuss it.  It's captivating and describes a world that existed here in America, but unfortunately, probably exists elsewhere in the world.  We should celebrate how far we have come as a nation.
B009MF56GC|4.0|I love this movie.  It is action paced and has a great sense of humor.  It also has all of the old action stars, who are really good.
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|If you have read the classics and/or even watched the movies you won't find anything new in Equilibrium. It is a blend of Fahrenheit 451 and Nineteen Eighty-Four. I highly recommend these books (and the movies that were based on them) instead.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Oh dang.  A 20 WORD minimum, not 20 character.  And here I was hoping to judt give a star rating. $75 for Celestia is bull... Total Trollestia. U Mad? Yeah I mad.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Was so excited to find this on lightning deals and bought it right away!  Excited to see that my movie came with a digital rental as well so I could give the DVD as a gift, and still get to watch it myself. :)  Thanks amazon!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham has returned to what he does best, legal thrillers. The characters were believable. The plot was certainly convoluted. I can see this as a movie in the future. Certainly worth the time to read.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The fact that it's My Little Pony based alone is freaking awesome, but it is also pretty cool. I Love it, and I don't ever see myself removing it from my kindle fire.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun and challenging.  gives your brain a workout - only downside is that after you beat a level there is no value in going back to that level (unless you didn't get a perfect score)
B006BXTOFC|5.0|If you enjoyed this band's first two albums, then you are going to enjoy this one as well. Really great style of sounding like all tracks are performed live. Whether it is a fast rocking track or something slow and Blues-like you're bound to find something on here that will captivate you. Enjoy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book.  Leaves you wondering time and again, how are they going to get out of that one?  The ending has some great twists that I never saw coming.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|At first I was reluctant to getting this album. Then I was given a chance to listen to the whole thing for free, I listened with an open mind and some patience. The more I heard, the more I wanted to replay each track. Like I said before, this album will grow on you hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I do.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my grand children. They enjoy movie night. I highly recommend this product from Tom Hanks.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I took notice of this album when Lana Del Rey first performed 'Video Games' on late night TV. I guess that it was the first song that gained notoriety on this album. Not to diss that particular track, however upon listening to the entire album, it became the song that I least enjoyed, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Go on, give it a whirl and relax while listening to National Anthem, what a great track. Cheers.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another one of Vince Flynn‘s “must read\\". As always, the book keeps one engrossed to the very last word. Awesome.....
159448385X|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot!!!! It really shows the audience a glimpse into a whole new different world. And even though the culture was different and all, it was still easy to relate to the characters and feel empathy for them and love them all the seem. This novel is filled with a capturing plot and beautifully created, three-dimensional characters. An absolute must read to anyone who appreciates good literature.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy is AMAZING!!!!!!!!! It is a must read to anyone any age. This series I could read over and over again.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|got it because I love cosmo and I love speedrunning. painted nails ftw. oh an d by the way FrankerZFG.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I saw this film on HBO and knew I had to get it for my dad, who having grown up in that generation is a natural Beatles fan. Its so entertaining and emotional - I can't wait to see it again!
0307719774|4.0|This 5 year diary caught my eye when I first saw it at Barnes and Noble. I noticed right away that it is kind of small in size and has no ribbon to mark your place. That aside, it's a pretty book with gold edges, a little more elegant than some others I've seen. Flipping through it, I noticed the variety of questions spanned from quick, easy and fun to deep and thought provoking, which I found nice. Overall it is a cute idea for anyone who finds a regular diary daunting, or for someone who is just short on time. I think its an excellent way to track your progress as you age and go through changes in life. I'm very excited to start mine in January!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game soooooo much didn't want to put it down excellent game.  I can't wait until the other part come out please let me know when the cont will arrived.
B00004W221|2.0|Shipping was absolutely terrible.. It took FOREVER! And when I opened the thing the DVD wasn't secure in the case! It was just flopping around!! Haven't watched it yet but so far I'm not impressed
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!  I never have time to read unless i am on vacation...but I could not put this one down.
B008ASLNN2|1.0|...from the overall storyline to the action sequences, I just didn't think this was as good as the first one.
0756404738|5.0|With the holidays coming up, Rothfuss’s 2 books would make amazing gifts to anyone who likes the following things:<br /><br />Joss Whedon stuffs<br /><br />Felicia Day….omg<br /><br />Buffy / Angel / Supernatural / Grim / Once<br /><br />Amber Benson<br /><br />Lord of the Rings / Hobbit<br /><br />Game of Thrones<br /><br />Wheel of Time / Shannara<br /><br />An Amazing Book<br /><br />Rothfuss is the next prolific fantasy writer of our time. He is the American Tolkien. Just an incredible book, incredible story, incredible characters, and an incredible author that I have had the extreme pleasure to meet. Do yourself a favor and read it. Buy it, borrow it, get it at the library. You will be hooked and you will love it!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I absolutely loved it!  It is very well written for this genre.  I have recommended it to many friends and they have all been equally impressed.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|A touching, fun, adventurous, and amazing movie. But please, don’t watch it with a wife or Girlfriend who hasn't seen her mother in a while. You will have a sobbing mess on your hands! :)
B000SJJCX4|1.0|Worked for about 6 months now will only work with external power supply - never would tune low B on 5 string bass - Amazon wont return now. You get what you pay for - wasted $30 on this thing!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I gave the game 5 stars, because it's probably not Rovio's fault that the Hoth update is taking so long to show up here.  i finally gave up, installed it from Google Play and transferred my progress over.  Here's how (requires root):<br /><br />Install Angry Birds Star Wars from the Google Play store, complete at least one level, exit the game, and then copy the following files from /data/data/com.rovio.angrybirdsstarwars.ads.amz.iap/files to /data/data/com.rovio.angrybirdsstarwars.ads.iap/files<br /><br />highscores.lua<br />settings.lua<br /><br />Once I did this, my Google Play version had all of my progress and I could uninstall the Amazon version.  I hope this helps others who are tired of waiting.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|This was an interesting movie, though some parts a bit vague and the ending somewhat trite, if you watch it, you may say at the end..well is this what starting anew and finding yourself is really about?
B0041KVYIW|4.0|As with many others who have been disappointed with the audio quality found on these 2012 LP releases, I also found the mid/high end to be quite lacking. However, I also found a solution that I recommend everyone try -- cleaning the new record.<br /><br />I wet cleaned using an enzyme solution (Walker Enzymes or Naturally Its Clean) with a special record cleaning pad from [...] rinsing with cold tap water, and drying with a microfiber cloth along with an hour of air drying. The results were astounding -- clean and crisp with all the detail found on my early British Parlophone copy. Purists can feel free to substitute distilled water for the tap water I use.<br /><br />Skeptical? Give it a try on a less valued record first. All I can say is this is the same cleaning process I've used for several years now on all my vintage records and I can only say it works every bit as well as my brother's VPI 16.5 record cleaning machine.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i couldnt see a ponyville game run any other way i love the sims city feel to it<br />i hope they add more story to it and more characters to buy
B0073LWEXK|2.0|No instructions for playing were included with this game. It was difficult to figure out what to do to get started.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|great!  I love ordering from amazon.com.  There is nothing left to say.  It saves me time, money, and lots of stress.
B00633W614|5.0|I loved the writing, historical details, and story line of this family saga. Anxiously awaiting the third book in the trilogy! I didn't really want to put these books down.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I'm hooked on the series and will end up reading them all, but feel like either the author is running out of steam, or maybe I'm just losing the sense of excitement I had with the first couple of books. Not bad, but just didn't ring my bell to the degree of prior books in the series.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|this is an awesome movie! great music, good drama, good actors. would definitely watch again. reccomend for my friend :)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|come on Amazon get with it ,we all want these updates,every time we have to wait weeks or months for updates, maybe we should all buy different systems..next time.kindle fire updating is getting old.....update got update feb.15th..to long!!!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. The price was less with the Amazon app store than through Google Play. It has tons of variations. I haven't tried the binaurals yet but I am fascinated by the concept.<br /><br />I bought this originally to use for my 11 month old when we were traveling. I usually use an MP3 player at home. I love the humming lullaby and I use it with the wind. Also, since I purchased it with the Amazon app store, I was able to install it easily on my Kindle Fire and my phone. This was great as one night my phone died and the Fire played all night instead.<br /><br />But I personally think I love it for myself! It is the perfect sound machine at the right price.
B009NOVCTM|1.0|Well Mick and the boys must need some money and some product to toss us like a bone, for their current tour.I am not going to start with the song choices, as all we know this is timeless stuff, but the edits are short and it is not chronological, which is the only real way to do a compilation period. But my main gripe here is the packaging- This is a pure a pure crap digi-pac where if you turn package upside down all the cds fall out of the loose slots in a cheap cardboard tri-fold. Nothing in the notes to speak of, not even ANY discography,(Who played on these cuts?) but only the legal minimum of songwriter and publisher- this is a sham. Juxtapose this release the same month as the glorious Beatles Box with the Rick Rubin produced, remastered, from original masters, Vinyl set of 14 original album set with a 250 page bound book. Yes, this is a totally different deal but wouldn't the Stones be as deserving of such respect & treatment?... apparently not. Hope they needed the money for this toss off. Music 5 stars, production -1 star.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I love this movie. I already have seen it 6 times and every time it gets better and better. I can't wait for the next one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A rare venture outside of his usual horror genre, yet one of the most compelling, must-turn-the-page King novels ever! Should be waved in the face of all those critics who typecast King as just a 'scary story author'.
B000I8ERVM|5.0|Short on special effects--not needed anyhow--this movie does a unique job of combining a mild thriller with a &#34;what-if&#34; story of religion meets secular law.  The back-and-forth between the defense attorney and the ADA is riveting and, though shortened for purposes of movie time, covers a lot of arguments in a fascinating way.  Love this movie and had my kids watch so they could also see some &#34;behind the scenes&#34; work on how an argument is formed and presented.
B0028RXXE8|4.0|I love these types of movies, and this is no exception.  It's done very well.  I just wish they would have continued...
B002QW7ALM|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this little known film. &#34;Pandorum&#34; has a pretty strong and quite original scenario and contains numerous twists and surprises, which are not as obvious as in most SF B-movies.<br /><br />The story takes place on board of the giant spaceship &#34;Elysium&#34;, which was send in XXII century in the first interstellar manned mission in history, towards an Earth-like exoplanet called Tanis, which without any doubt harbors life. The voyage will take 123 years, so most of &#34;Elysium&#34; passengers hibernate during the travel - successive teams crewmen are awakened and then put to sleep again, each giving two years of their lifetime for the travel. This film tells the story of the fifth shift. It begins when lieutenant Payton (Denis Quaid) and corporal Bower (Ben Foster) wake up, just to realize that their predecessors are not there, that the ship is damaged, that they can not raise anybody on the interphone and that SOMETHING is roaming the corridors outside. After this rather uncomfortable start they will have to figure out what the heck happened and what to do next, beginning with finding a way to exit the chamber in which they woke up...)))<br /><br />Those are the first two-three minutes of film and about the rest I will say no more, but let's stress it again - the scenario is pretty solid and certainly original. I watched the DVD in one go, because the story is really interesting and the tension and uncertainty are maintained until the end. The interiors of the &#34;Elysium&#34; are pretty well designed and even if light is scarce during most of the film (a pretty clever idea by the way) we quickly realise that this thing is ENORMOUS. The difficult and perilous trek through the gigantic spaceship reminded me a little of classical Brian Aldiss SF novel &#34;Non-stop&#34; (but just to be clear, here the solution of the mystery is different than in this book).<br /><br />Now, this film has also some elements which make it rather impossible to rate it five stars. The exact nature of SOMETHING that roams the corridors is one of them. It gives the occasion to some honest action scenes, but frankly, to my personal taste it pulled this film down a little. Also, the idea that in XXII century Earth will have a human population of 24 billion people and therefore will not be able to sustain human life anymore, now pleeaaaase, this is such a cliche...<br /><br />But those weaker elements notwithstanding I liked this film a lot, much, much more than I expected and I believe it is one of the best and most original SF B-movies of those last years. Recommended wholeheartedly to all SF aficionados!impossible to rate it five stars. The exact nature of SOMETHING that roams the corridors is one of them.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|Decent size with lots of room for lens, camera, flash, filter, etc. It looks very sturdy. My only concern is to carry this bag during warm season as my back will be sweaty due the material used to make this bag. Other than this, best bang for the buck.
B007549W62|2.0|I didn't like this film and I regret that I bought it, for many reasons, not the least of which is that I was deceived by the image and teaser on the cover of the DVD.<br /><br />I thought I was buying a SF film about survivors of a nuclear war trying to go on with their lifes. This film however is something diiferent. The original cataclysm is barely shown and is never explained - we never learn what exactly happened. The whole story is in fact a study in the slow but certain disappearance of all social order and even purely human reflexes amongst a group of people who are trapped in a cage without exit (an underground shelter) and with dwindling food and water supply...<br /><br />The film is full of incredibly vulgar language - it seems that absolutely everybody speaks with the \\"F\\" bomb beginning every sentence. There are purely obscene moments of sexual nature (nothing to do with love-making). Excrements, menstrual blood, rotting bodies and swarming cockroaches, all play considerable role by moments. There are very graphic scenes of murder, rape and torture. In one word, this film has more in common with \\"Saw\\" franchise than with SF movies. This is most of the plot and of the scenario - and this film REALLY disgusted me.<br /><br />I would rate this thing one star, if it was not for the last five minutes, which contain one pretty cruel but really intelligent twist, which I didn't see coming at all. I also must admit that actors did a rather good job and the cast is strong: Michael Biehn, Rosanna Arquette, Courtney B. Vance, Milo Ventimiglia and Ashton Holmes all did very well. It is however Lauren German (an actress I never heard about before), playing the main female role, who offers the best performance - she sure can act.<br /><br />But other than the last five minutes, watching this film was for me personally a VERY unpleasant experience. My advice - avoid it, except if you really like films in which people torture, rape and murder other people in the middle of rotting bodies and crawling insects...of rotting bodies and crawling insects...
B001EN71CW|4.0|It's Firefly.  There really isn't much to say.  The only complaint I have is that the picture looks very grainy sometimes.  Not often, but enough that I remember it.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|The replay value of this game is very high. It took three tries to get to a good ending but worth every minute.
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|Lets start off by saying silent hill has little plot. But that is not what it set out to do. What you get by seeing this film is a great gory horror movie that will make you leave the theater shivering scared. Typically people who liked the first didn't like this one but if you want more gore you'll like this
B007HACDLK|5.0|I loved it as well as I did all the rest of the Mitch Rapp books.  Read it quickly so you can tell others how good it is!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I chose a rating of 3 stars because Martin has some good ideas and he weaves them intricately.  However, he seems habituated to introducing a gigantic cast of main characters with little thought beyond extending the story.  After a while it  seems that the ubiquitous portrayal of  hideous cruelty and a desire to create a near constant sordidness becomes tiresome. Combine the large cast of characters with lengthy spans between each volume and the reader needs the patience of Job and the memory of an elephant to keep the saga functioning.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I saw the movie first, but wish I had read the book first.  The movie was true to the book, but left out some important (to me) details.  I really liked it!
034580404X|5.0|One of the most enjoyable, readable and funny books I have ever read. The back & forth banter was wonderful.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is right in my wheelhouse as far as books go.  I simply cannot wait for the next one.  Buy it...
0895292211|5.0|Using the principles of this book - as well as that of Weston A. Price - my daughter was able to overcome severely crippling rheumatoid arthritis without medications.  Enzyme rich foods are present in raw animal proteins and fats most abundantly, Dr. Howell explains.  My daughter drank 5 gallons of raw milk per week, ate raw beef liver 4 oz. per week, raw butter, raw egg yolks, and occasionally sushi, and steak tartare.  These are not foods recommended by the USDA food pyramid - but they are very healing.  Dr. Howell warned that healing would take time, he observed that RA patients require about 24 months to heal.  His estimate was correct.  Two years on this diet and my daughter is living her life fully again, virtually with no pain.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I thought it was a weak romance.  I also didn't appreciate the end setting up for a sequel at the expense of adequately ending the first story.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II is absoloutely my favorite album ever.  I listen to it at work, in my truck, at home...
B009WO7NQO|4.0|the app is great nut I cant get it to update. it takes forever to load and I have to wait s month or two yo update it
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Zeppelin rocks. I could listen to this all day; it reminds me of my teens.  Love Led Zeppelin.  It's my second favorite LZ album.
0345472322|5.0|This book was a mandatory read in our school system.  It not only provided us with a different way of interacting with our students, it helped us identify some fixed mindset patterns in our own lives.  I have taught my students, through this new knowledge and language, to enjoy and expect a challenge.  Then they know they are learning.  I also teach that setbacks don't define you and that we are ALL a work in progress.  Thank you Carol.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Wow! What a well developed plot through out the movie! I was a follower of Thor in my young and teen years, being my favorite superhero. Once the movie started there was no stopping. The pause button on my DVD player works just fine, but I didn't want to miss the continuing action!
B009HV2JT8|2.0|It was predictable, but the fire and explosions kept drawing my attention away from my laptop. Glad I didn't pay theater prices to see it.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|This season is as good as the last and previous 5.  Doesn't disappoint.  I kinda know how it ends but don't really care
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Well Beautiful Disaster is a roller coaster romance but well worth the ride. I read it in less than a weekend. I have 3 kids and had report cards to complete but I had to finish it - then I made 2 more friends read it! Beautiful Disaster is that good!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is one of Flynn's best.  I loved that he brought back one of his previous characters and how he has woven him into this story so perfectly.  I look forward to the next escapade that Mitch gets involved in.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|This is an oldie  but so very enjoyable to listen to.  I have a copy of my own, and bought this one for a friend for a Christmas present.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I purchased this for my boyfriend who does not believe in &#34;owning movies&#34; but gave in to wanting to buy this one because he was renting it too much.  It's a watch over and over movie  . . . at least for him!  : )
091581112X|5.0|If you would like to increase your spiritual awarness I would highly suggest that you get this book.  If you want to keep playing around about spirituality, do not get this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Not exactly your typical Grisham, he takes it outside the courtroom for a change of pace. The plot ebbs and flows and had me confused for a while but he ties it all together at the end. Not his best but still a great book if you like other<br />Grisham works.
0375805613|5.0|I loved reading this book when I was a kid, and was always so entertained by the story. I loved this board-book version for my 18-mo, a little more durable. She loves sesame street and &#34;Grove&#34;, so I thought this would be a great gift for under the tree this year. I hope she will like reading at as much as I did, and if not - I will still get a few great laughs.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|This functional but limited app does its job with a minimum of fuss but I observed little difference between the pay for version and the free version except, perhaps, for the absence of the unobtrusive ads.<br />Update: Battery Pro indicated that my battery was healthy, temperature was normal,etc. at the same time the battery wouldn't hold a charge or accept a charge...so that information is useless.Becoming less happy with this app as time passes.
B005CFWH36|3.0|These style of clogs are not the same fit as the ones they were names after. I was very disappointed. The colors were okay, just not as bright as I had expected either. They looked cheap.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Believe it or not, my first Angry Birds game. I only got it because I'm a Star Wars fan. So far, pretty fun.<br />Just one big problem: the targets aren't visible - they're off screen, or you only see the forward edge. The screen pans over _after_ you fire. Is it supposed to be this way? I don't think so. How can you 'aim' when you can't see your target objects?<br /><br />Yep, fun but frustrating.<br /><br />[update] Bumped it up a star now that I learned that I can zoom out! Makes it kind of small though. Oh well, at least I have an option to choose from.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows on TV right now.  I had no problem streaming the show; good video quality without adds.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Without a doubt, this book is not for those unfamiliar with 80's video games, comic books and cartoons. But if you are, it's really a quick fun read. Shakespeare it is not, but worth your time if you fit into the right demographic.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it is a nice big display when you are charging, but otherwise it is only is visible when you go to the app. I guess i thought it would have a small icon i could see all the time from desktop/front page.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Flipboard is a &#34;killer app&#34; period. It's a must have for any tablet and on the kindle fire, it is essential. Much has been said by others about how well done it is, so I will just second that. Worth every penny.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|if you read the first one the second is more of the same, same problems, but more people are involved.while the first one had some pretty hot sections maybe I am getting immune but this one is not as intriguing.
B002BY62A0|5.0|So much great information...everyone should read this book. I can't recommend it enough for eveyone who is concerned with living a long healthy life. The answers are so simple!
1453624910|4.0|This is bits of background for the popular Nightrunner series, with some fun &#34;behind the scenes&#34; episodes and some fan art. Not really a standalone book, and probably puzzling for people who are not already immersed in the series, but a nice add-on book.
B009B0CZXU|5.0|Awesome cd! This is my first album that I have bought by Bat For Lashes. Each song has beauty in it. I recommend it!
0345522303|5.0|It has the same fun characters from the rest of the Nightrunner series, but with a very intriguing and original villain; I like that this book was more self-contained than the previous books, and more focused on character. Highly recommended!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the different story lines,it makes it even more exciting. Season 3 has so much emotions and suspenseful surprises.  The new characters are well added.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Wish I didn't have to keep buying it because of the #(*@^*!_ NFL runovers! :)<br />But the show is great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's nice to have a calculator app available on my Kindle Fire for when some calculations are necessary.  I'd recommend this.
B009SQRC9E|4.0|My 8-year-old loves this movie!  She has watched it 2 days in a row and is pretending to be Santa and his elves!
1439152802|5.0|I am a huge fan and love all her books. I was not disappointed! My husband was upset, however, when I was so very distracted but this book... it was an obsession! Buy it; you will love it!
B007HACDLK|3.0|I'm like many of you, love a great spy thriller,have read many of Flynn's novels and enjoyed them, but this is not one them. This is the story of an Operations Chief who is kidnapped in Afghanistan, and Mitch is put on the trail to find him...First, Mitch seems to always be angry which takes away from the \\"cool dude\\" persona of the Mitch character, Secondly, there are no surprises, you will pick up the so-called \\"twists\\" before they happen..Flynn's novels were always the kind that you couldn't put down, just one more page, \\"gotta see what happens\\" - this one is not like that, it's an \\"OK\\" novel, not the worst book ever written, but nothing that  you will remember or will say \\"you JUST HAVE to read this\\".. so for me I offer you the opinion that you should move on to another novel you've been wanting to read, and pass on this one until the price goes down and you've exhausted your \\"gotta read\\" list of \\"spy novels\\".<br /><br />Short Review:<br />Predictable + lackluster + redundant = an ok, but not great, mediocre novel
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is easy and fun. you can change the background. it is also multiplayer. When you win the cards Will do something neat.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|... but it was an utter mess. If it had kept to the internecine struggle or the major battle epic it would have been fine but it didn't do either well.
B008HK3S9K|5.0|It is easy to find in my bag comfortable fit fo the Kindle Fire HD just like the color pattern options and easy use of envelope
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Definitely the best season so far in the series. Some drama, character development and of course, lots of Zombies! LOVE IT!!!!
031618201X|5.0|It's not easy being a spinster in Victorian Era London, but for Alexia Tarabotti, it's a nightmare. She is a preternatural, a being considered to be \\"soulless,\\" and capable of reducing supernaturals, such as vampires and werewolves, to mere mortals by making physical contact with them.<br /><br />It all started when Alexia is attacked by a roaming Vampire and kills him. If that had been as simple as it gets, there wouldn't be any need for a panic. However, this is not the case. Lord Maccon, werewolf Alpha, is sent by Queen Victoria to investigate, but of course, he and Alexia fight like cats and ... werewolves.<br /><br />Though initially not interested in getting involved in this supernatural affair, Alexia is quickly engulfed in a shady plot involving an unknown menace, one which is definitely unnatural, but seems immune to her powers. Add in the natural frictions between Vampires and Werewolves and stir well, and you've got a prime recipe for chaos. Bring that to a simmer, and add a touch of natural comedy, followed by a drop of unexpected romance between Alexia and Lord Maccon and you've got a thrilling story full of intrigue, violence, and love.<br /><br />Then, there is the fact that the most important events of this volume take place on the night of a full moon, a.k.a. the worst time to be a werewolf. It is a good thing Alexia can turn werewolves human again with her touch, because what would happen if she was pitted against the one she loved in his most ferocious incarnation? And if she makes it through that experience, what will follow? Certainly not a wedding, right? Right?!<br /><br />This story started out as a beautifully-written novel series by Gail Carriger, and has now found its way into the manga world, thanks to the REM and Yen Press. The book is a little bit larger and thicker than your average manga, so you can expect that much more substance packed into it. This manga touches on the evil that mankind is capable of committing - the non-supernatural humans. It's a story of trust across boundaries such as race, nature, etc.<br /><br />Reviewed by David Gromer
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|This is our third year buying Lego Advent calendars from Amazon for our boys (both under 10).  They wake up very early to open their daily legos.  Even our older son is getting up at 6 am because he's so excited to see what he'll get that day.  The price on Amazon is good as I was at a store by my home and its cost was $50.<br /><br />Lots of fun.  The box is a nice storage container for after the holidays.  A wonderful tradition in our household!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I was looking for ways to move files around easily on my Kindle Fire.  This app fits the bill perfectly.  Some fo the ebooks I buy are not through Amazon directly and downloading and transferring them into the right directory without having a computer nearby can be a hassle.  This program allows me to do that through my Kindle with no issues.  Great app.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and bought this for my son to enjoy as well.  He loves adventure type movies as well.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have overlooked this book for my whole life, thinking that the various movies had completely covered the book. I was wrong! Reading the original in Dickens' own prose was more than worth the time invested. Read and enjoy; and keep Christmas in your heart throughout the year as well!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have 3 lens plus a heavy SLR. This fits all my equipment plus flash, diffuser with room to spare.
B002DD67XG|2.0|This was OK, but not outstanding. Sound quality so-so. I think it may have been from a live performance 10-20 years after the songs were originally released. Thanks for making them available, though.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|the game was fun for a few days but didn't have enough variety to keep me coming back. I lost interest relatively quickly.
B000W0B0G6|5.0|I had forgotten how much I loved this album. It reminds me of my college days and good times. It's funny how a song can take you back to a particular moment in time. Fond memories.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|There aren't many books that I can't put down but this is one of them. It's a real page-turner and I stayed up way too late reading it. For prose addicts like me, this book would be a good way to spend a winter Sunday.<br /><br />The tone is very upbeat, even though the story is about an astronaut trying to survive after being abandoned on Mars. The scientific angles were very well handled, from the astronaut's Robinson Crusoe-like efforts on Mars to the orbital physics of the rescue operation. For a hard SF fan like me, this was a treat.<br /><br />The plot was well thought-out and the pacing was excellent. Kudos to Mr. Weir.<br /><br />One reviewer commented about the F-bomb. There's no shortage of that, though I thought the hero's character was engaging despite (and sometimes *because of*) his frequently profane soliloquies. If the hero's characterization wasn't tempered with a little profanity, it would be hard to take him seriously: he'd be just too upbeat to believe. (IOW, I'd probably be cursing a blue streak if I were in his shoes.)<br /><br />The other characters were also well drawn. And some of them were equally - but believably - profane.<br /><br />You never know what you'll find, shopping the Kindle SF section. This book is a real jewel and I recommend it very highly.<br /><br />I wish I could find more books this good at this price. I'd be a happy addict.
0307592731|2.0|I decided to listen to, rather than read this book.  That might have been my mistake because I grew to intensely dislike Cheryl, or should I say the reader of Cheryl's book.  So it was hard for me to warm up to the author.  But that isn't my problem with the book.<br /><br />The story just seemed to go on without much structure or any interesting factoids.  We learned about who she had sex with or wanted to have sex with, perhaps that's interesting to some.  However, there are so many books that describe adventure well. The great ones do it in a way that make you WANT to be there because you can almost smell and taste the words.  This was not one of those.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm surprised this book is a best seller.  Could be the power of Oprah.  Or maybe I just missed something.
B009OA57MI|5.0|This is the best game ever! You can create your own boards or download someone else's. It is kind of realistic and loads of fun. Hours endless play.
B0073XORCY|4.0|Typical vintage Tull, have waited too long for this sequel, still it was welcomed like a long lost family member returning after a extended absence
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator because it's really easy to read and easy to work with .I have it with me wherever I go.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I can't imagine not having this on the Kindle.  It is great.  I do not have to worry about the screen getting marked up now because of the cover and it's very handy when reading while eating.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I installed this app for my granddaughter and the next day my kindle had 19 notifications from ponies wanting her to come play.  I uninstalled the app - I don't want messages from games thank you
B007FZ7QZA|3.0|I bought this CD for my 15yr old who is a HUGE Chris Brown fan. He cursed quite a bit in a few songs and I wasn't too pleased. Next time i'll look for the explicit lyrics logo on amazon prior to purchasing.
B005R32L66|3.0|The fuctions are easy to use, but its wierd to here others  see me as a smurf.<br />I confirmed it is supernova as my wife has one and video from hers also has red and blue colors backwards on the sending end of the app.
1451696191|5.0|I literally could not put this book down.  I started reading it before work, and was extremely aggravated everytime my job interrupted my progress.  This book is brilliantly written and I would and will recommend it to every reader I know.
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|this guy is pure genius. I have had this for about a year and it sounds better every time!<br />He has more talent, feeling and soul than anyone alive! he has layers of music and is thoroughly enjoying every minute.<br />I would give my right arm to meet him.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|works fine for a basic app i like to see times i should get to what i do get.thank you
0767817664|5.0|When i was little, this movie had my scared and laughing at the same time. You gotta see this one. Make sure you have popcorn.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is one of (if not the) best sci-fi shows to ever hit TV. IT is only through the short shortsightedness of a single Fox executive that this show didn't run for 8-10 years. The cast are perfect together a mix of everyday folks, no heroes or geniuses.<br />Join the Browncoats!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love the fact that it will turn it self off. Some other products similar to this just plays all night.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Serenity is one of the few movies that truly is just as good as the original TV show it is based on!<br />Don't damage your calm, get this now.<br /><br />PS Might be a good idea to bring along some grenades...
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Every track is fire. Pick it up and hope you have the honor of seeing these guys live in concert one day.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I was shopping around for a while, looking for a nice everyday watch ( I haven’t owned one since I was a kid), and I settled with this Seiko. Overall it’s a great find for the price, and an automatic at that, it seems to keep good time, I haven’t had any issues thus far. The band is comfortable, and has about 10 eyelets, so it’s really easy to get a nice fit. The size of the face isn't that big, but I was anticipating that, it looks great on my wrist. If you are second guessing this watch, get it, let me be the voice of reason, it really is a great watch, I have had it for about two weeks, and with taking it off during the evenings, it has not stopped once. I even had a doctor at work complement it at work, he made me take it off so he could look at it.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I just wished there was more detail to the end. You did a prologue book, please do an epilogue? Even if its only like 50 pages, i want to see that they build the world again back up, where Brenda and Thomas end up an just everything.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is very awesome.There are different people.I un- locked the ninga.Tagbot.Lucy. and Tricycle.I used .'s for commas because this does not have any.I just made my first reveiw(just kiding).Please do'nt cut my ear for that(just mixing again)but just do'nt pleeeaaase. and thankyou.
B0083Z614S|5.0|If you love re-reading a well loved childhood book, this is a great one. It brings back wonderful memories. Quick read but enjoyable.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I've loved Bonnie since the 70s, and this CD took me right back to what I consider her glory days, even before the biggest commercial hits, when I fell in love with her voice, her guitar, her warmth. She's in great voice on this new CD, the band is tight, songs such as \\"You Can't Fail Me Now\\" are instant favorites. Highly recommended!!!
B004EKCNMA|5.0|The movie is pretty true to the book and the annimation is fantastic!  I highly recommend you give it a look this holiday season.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love this game!  The levels get harder as you go meaning you have to become more creative to solve them.  Like the challenge in that.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|Finally completed my collection of this series. Good show. Love that I will be able to watch as many times as I want. Great price!
B0073PPNE8|5.0|Love this movie, was fantastic on my Kindle Fire when traveling. Wasnt very quick to upload but sure that was internet not amazon
B008602KQI|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  I did read the book first; so I realize there is so much they can't put in the movie due to time.  But, all in all, I feel it was definitely worth the money!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great Exciting Trek Movie.  bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla.  Movie is good.  Review is over now.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I pre-ordered this book because the synopsis was appealing and the promise of a good story was too attractive to refuse. The promise of a good story was kept and exceeded. The characters were multi-faceted and real to life. The story was well told and I enjoyed the realistic dialogue. I laughed, I cried, and I rejoiced at the happy ending. It wouldn't be a romance without the \\"the happy ending.\\" If you love a good romance, I definitely recommend this book!! Happy reading :-)
B008GAXUGW|5.0|This is the best deal ever on Luigi Boccherini!! (at around $65.00) Worth the price for the cello works and string quintets alone!!!! Thus, the 5 stars.<br /><br />Boccherini was a master cellist and composer elite who combined attractive melodies with passages of exciting virtuosity. Boccherini composed with vim, verve, vigor, and vitality. His music possesses noble Mozart-like regality and sparkle !!! You will not be disappointed with this purchase ! Time will avail and elevate his stature.<br /><br />Unfortunately it has only four of his many string quartets, few of his symphonies, as well as his forty-plus string trios, and quintets with viola (however, some are are his least memorable works). It also does not have his superlative and magnificent flute quintets. It does include his oboe concertos and Stabat Mater.<br /><br />I wish Brilliant came out with this before I spent over twice as much on just the 9 volumes of the string quintets alone. The String Quintets by \\"La Magnifica Comunita\\" are Outstanding. Boccherini is listed in the Guinness Book of Music Facts and Feats as \\"the most ingratiating composer.\\" He was a supreme master in a genre (quintets) once described as \\"artstocratic party music\\". Play this music ambiently for social events and gatherings with wine, fruits, meats, and cheeses. If you like Haydn and Mozart, you will like this!<br /><br />The cello works are fantastic pieces of composition, although on a couple sonatas I can hear some pages being turned and other sounds during the recording, but the reverb is perfect!! I have all the Haydn Baryton Trios and cello works by Bach, Beethoven, and Vivaldi (and I love them), but for me, Boccherini's cello works equal and exceed, in many cases, those works. Listen and then judge objectively for yourself. Boccherini had a unique compositional style. Listen to cello sonata in C G3 and know a new style of exquisite cello unlike any other composer. Then, listen to the rest of his sonatas and truly appreciate the style of Boccherini cello masterpieces!<br /><br />My opinion only, as I do not seek nor relish in vengeful or vindictive animus or acrimony.<br /><br />As usual, there are some problems with any Brilliant box set and this one is no exception. Covers, notes, times, and titles are missing and or incomplete at times. The set is nicely packaged and a value !!!!!!!  If my house were burning down I would grab this on my way out!!<br /><br />Have a great day friends!!!te the style of Boccherini cello masterpieces!<br /><br />My opinion only, as I do not seek nor relish in vengeful or vindictive animus or acrimony.<br /><br />As usual, there are some problems with any Brilliant box set and this one is no exception.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day is a wonderful writer!!  I couldn't put Bared to You down and have read it multiple times.  I have read Reflected in You a couple of times and found it to be more intense of a story than book one.  And it has stuck with me with lots of internal dialog of what, why and really???  I am impatiently waiting for book 3 in the spring and will read books 1 & 2 several more times before then I am sure!!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Its definitely hard to put down.  Helps if you have read some of his other Corey novels as he doesn't give a lot of background.  I think the \\"Panther\\" was not quite as interesting as previous \\"villains\\" but enjoyed the suspense.  It was cool to see the Brenner character integrated in the book.  The gold coast still remains my favorite DeMille book with cathedral and up country a close second
B004T4LUPW|4.0|This is a very easy app to work with.  One dislike is that you cannot do recurring appts bi-weekly.  Sometimes I have appts that are every other week.<br />Other than that I like this app.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought this was a great read! I took it on vacation & could barely put it down... The twists & turns are crazy! Definitely recommend it!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love this case. Its perfect for my son to use and super easy for him to handle on the go.
0545265355|5.0|A complicated, sad and wonderful love story lies beneath this wonderful book series, but more importantly it reflects humans will to live their lives on their own terms and conditions no matter the cost. This is an exciting trilogy which will give you many sleepless nights where you just can't put the book down!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The newsfeed won't load more than a few posts.  It.just continues to spin like it's loading. Very frustrating!!  Please fix this issue ASAP!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What a well written novel. Finished it in just a few days, wish it had been longer. Feels like the walking dead twenty years after the show.
B007HACDLK|5.0|this one was very exciting and kept you,  interested in the story through out the whole book likeall of vince flynn books.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's challenging and super fun. I love the guy and the way he runs. I've named him Rusty. Love the sound effects too!
B0058YPL66|5.0|If you love watching the tenth kingdom, this is like the tenth kingdom on steroids! My wife and I love these episodes. At first I started to watch them and wasn't too interested until episode 4 and on just have me hooked. Love the 1st season, now I just hope the 2nd season can live up to its expectations.
B0083DJUMA|4.0|This look at the Maker movement has a number of interesting features.<br /><br />Anderson, a writer and editor for Wired magazine, is also the grandson of the man who invented the automatic sprinkler system for homes. He was exposed at an early age to the conventional process of making and inventing. He also runs his own company making autopilots for radio controlled aircraft. The combination gives him a unique insight into the changes things like 3D printers and rapid prototyping offer, especially for hobbyists.<br /><br />Make no mistake, Anderson is a True Believer in the Maker movement and sometimes his rah-rah approach wears. On the other hand, as he points out the potential for print-your-own objects and a new paradigm for manufacturing is nothing short of breathtaking. It makes you want to rush out and buy your own 3D printer today.<br /><br />Even if you don't buy into the Maker movement entirely. There's a lot of food for thought here as well as a look at a highly disruptive technology right on the ankle of the growth curve.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was riveting! It was not uplifting, but yet it was  hopeful. It was so well written that you could imagine yourself with the narrator.  Towards the end of the book I could not put it down. Would highly recommend.
B002IDH4PQ|5.0|there's nothing like having an album on vinyl. this is a great album by itself. it's the type of album you can put on and just drift away. every song (but one) is fantastic. the art is amazing and it definitely adds something to having it on vinyl.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Charlize makes this film work and that's why I original purchased it, being a fan or her work... and beauty. Theron's performance is wonderfully wicked and the special effects giving her an aged appearance really create a classic sense of gothic gloom. Stewart is decent, but \\"fairest of them all\\"? I don't think so, she's a cute girl but not a classic beauty denoting purity and wonder... but it works overall. So far I've only watched the instant video version on my PS3 via the Amazon app, so it should be a drastic improvement visually when i get my Blu-ray order. The scope of the screenplay doesn't exceed the original tale, which is actually small in scope, so they did the best they could without adding completely foreign plot lines that would convolute the production... but it is a totally linear story experience that retains all we have come to know as Snow White. This movie sets along side Lord of the Rings etc, so in my opinion it's worth adding to the fantasy collection.
B0082EOJYE|3.0|The captions often didn't stay on the screen long enough.<br />The story line was pretty common.<br />The Dog was the best part!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Great story. Great characters. By the end my mind was blown. It is not a game for everyone as it is very text heavy but for those who appreciate great storytelling look no further
1595827684|5.0|Great product, pretty good book filled with art of the acclaimed game series. Recommended both for fans and character / environment artists.
B0043JDUNS|2.0|Sorry, I know a lot of people really liked this movie. I'm guessing though that it was just because they liked the first Iron Man movie so much and they were still on an Iron Man high from that movie. Or maybe because they are just diehard fanboys of DC or Iron Man comics.  I dont know why anyone would give this movie anything higher than a 2 star rating.  It was boring.  It moved so slow that when there finally was an action scene I didnt even care anymore what was going on in the movie or what the plot was. It's hard to make me fall asleep in a movie, but I did exactly that in this movie.  Trust me, it is very slow and will bore you to sleep.  Maybe it was becuase I was watching it at home in my nice comfy recliner, but I've watched hundreds of other movies in that chair and I dont fall alseep.  Even some chic-flicks I've watched at home draw me in to the story line better than Iron Man 2. The only reason Im not giving it a one star is because it did have some action and when it did it was fairly descent fight scenes, but everything else in between those couple of action scenes is 1 star at best. I wouldnt even waste a dollar at Redbox renting this.  If you can catch it on tv or Amazon Prime for free and you got nothing better to do for 2 hours of your life then maybe waste some time.  But even then there has to be hundreds of better movies out there that you could waste time watching that would be better than this one.
B0098460O4|5.0|He is the next upcoming Pavoratti! He is one amazing singer for his age! You have to listen and make your own decisions.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book,in my opinion, is the best Grisham book ever and I have read all but 2 or 3 of his books. Grisham is one of only a few fictional authors that I read.  I normally stick to non-fiction.  Easily 5 stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is absolutely fantastic that I don't know the right words to describe it, but the plot, katniss's point of view ... BRILLIANT!
B005UA0FLE|5.0|Love this music.  Michael has a wonderful style of singing and it is a joy to listen to him sing these Christmas classics!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read other books by Mitch Albom and this one is a good parable.  It does have some lessons to be learn but they are limited and most you already practice.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I don't normally follow shows.....I always thought it was weird when my friends would meet up weekly to watch, \\"sons of anarchy\\".<br /><br />with this show, I NOW SEE why people would do that! I watched one episode and finished the whole season in less than 2 days! 5 stars all the way!
0143121316|5.0|Kissinger had put together a well written book explaining China's relationship with the West for the 21st Century. Although the heart of the book is the breakthrough establishing of US relations with China that Kissinger played a central role, the first third of the book lays out a solid analysis of how Chinese history affects modern Chinese foreign policy.  Any serious student of international relations and anyone interested in Chinese foreign policy should read this book written by an individual who has not only studied China, but is one of the key players who fashioned the West's relationship with China today.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very well written.  I thoroughly enjoyed 50 Shades, but I can't wait for the final installment of the Crossfire series.  Very well written.  Loved it!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Wouldn't get past the 2nd welcome screen.  Just kept booting me out.  Too bad because it looked like it would be a beautiful and interesting game to play.
B0010T56J0|1.0|Too slow, not much going on.  I couldn't even finish it.  There was no character study, no plot that I could see, nothing.  I kept waiting for something to happen or for something to mean something or to see if there was any direction in it.  Maybe it was just me, but I don't get it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was a wonderful movie that really captured the spirit of the Dr. Seuss book. The animation wwas well done! The product met and exceeded all of my expectations!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Great book! Loved it so much! Right once I picked it up, there was no putting it down! Awesome book
B009O2XY12|5.0|It's mindless till you get to the higher levels. Hate the blurbs about buying gems. Fun and entertaining game even for adults
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was probably my favorite of the trilogy! It is action packed and very good!!! And I love the ending alot!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the different type of game options.  You also can go to the next game without passing previous game.This game is addictive
B005K0HDGE|5.0|In the middle of it yet. Can't put it aside. Stories within the main story. Anxious to find out how it is going to end!
B008133MDK|5.0|i love this show! smart, funny, great back and forth between the main characters. fantastic stories. i wish they were making a lot more!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book was okay. I think it is for a younger reader than myself.65.  The characters were interesting . I will probably not read the rest of he series.
B005URRCNQ|5.0|How can you not like the Black Keys? I dont have to review it; if you like or love the Black Keys, you will buy the album...and if you don't know who the Black Keys are...BUY THE ALBUM!<br /><br />Great music from a great band.
1400067820|5.0|Finally, a book that fully explores a topic, leaving no stone unturned...<br /><br />Antifragile, in a brief attempt to summarize, is basically something that benefits from, and even continues to develop, in a chaotic or disruptive environment.<br /><br />This book explains, to a very deep and thorough level, the valid examples of things that fall into this category, and why we should pay attention to them.<br /><br />It is by far one of my favorite reads of the year 2012, and highly recommended.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Great movie but Kristen Stewart cannot act. I would recommend that others see this movie if they get the chance
B008CPZNL6|5.0|What a time saver.  I am able to see the world at a glance.<br />I love the convience of having my interests brought to me<br />two days before the news!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Another fabulously written book, Suzanne Collins sure knows how to keep you reading, this book was excellent and left me desperate to start the next book
