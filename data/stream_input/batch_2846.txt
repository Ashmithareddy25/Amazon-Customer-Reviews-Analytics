B009AY04A8|5.0|A proper free game. I've been searching for ages for a decent. Got though the first two chapters and like that it's challenging but not impossible like some hidden object games. The graphics are clear and the zoom in option is a plus. AND...... it hasn't asked me for money to carry on the game or want me to buy something to get me too the next chapter.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app so much!!! I play it all day, but there are some glitches in the system.  It is better on the iPhone!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing device, and it is just at its beginning stages. I cannot wait to see what is in store for this little device. I ordered it the day it came out and be happy with it ever since. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys internet TV and doesn't want to spend a ton of money on cable monthly. I know I don't.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|Movie starts out well but falls flat as it progresses. It becomes very predictable. The script is weak and the pace is slow. They added some action sequences to keep it interesting but without a solid story it didn't work well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book, worth every penny. I bought this book for recreational reading.... And ended up finishing the book 10 hours later. Amazing
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a fun game with lots of challenges.  Completing rooms can be very frustrating. They get you hooked and then make it hard to complete rooms. I have fun though.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It works OK if you have netflex or want to watch youtube on your TV but I thought that I would be able to watch anything from my pc on the TV. This is not the case. I still have to watch my movies on the pc because the Chromecast would not send them to the TV.
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|This is one of the movies that got me interested in anime, watching it now, it isn't the greatest movie out there, but I still love it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Always a pleasure to read this again after so many years.  Greatly recommended!  Look forward to seeing the movie...May it live up to the book!
B000AAF1U4|4.0|Loved this movie many years ago, and I still do, it's a great movie. Definitely not one of Disney's &#34;A&#34; movies, but it's still good.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Ok game. Little boring after awhile. Be nice if there was more to do like different maps and more upgrades.
B000065K6N|5.0|This is one of my favorite anime movies of all time. Do yourself a favor, stop reading this, go buy it now.<br /><br />Really, it's an excellent movie by Hayao Miyazaki, if like anime, and don't know that name, get yourself acquainted with it ASAP. If you don't really like anime and somehow ended up here, the best way I can describe him as sort of a Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney.<br /><br />His films are ALL fantastic in their own way. This movie specifically may be a bit more violent than the rest of his works, and even more so than what most people consider standard kids films, I really feel this is appropriate for most normal kids. It's definitely no worse than Lion King, have you seen that movie recently? It's pretty brutal.<br /><br />At any rate, this is one of my favorite Miyazaki movies, but probably not my absolutely favorite. Definitely one of his best I feel.
B00E8TWPI4|5.0|Originally it was my daughter who was counting down the days til this movie made it debut on Disney. It turns out our whole family watched and enjoyed it so much we got the kindle version and the soundtrack. Highly recommend it!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|After playing for the time till asking for this review hasn't been bad. Cant complain to much yet only been playing for 20 minutes or so
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BINGO Blitz is a fun game. I enjoy playing daily to see if I can win! It is a great way to wind down after a long day at work.
B00005LK94|5.0|Thanks for the promptness.  It was sent as a gift and they were heading to church camp when it arrived, everyone enjoyed it!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I would recommend this free calculator. Usage is easy & BIG number keyboard is convenient.<br />Easy to use on Tablet format. Easier than cell phone, especially for us guys with FAT fingers.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can't explain how easy this was to set up. I bought one...set it up at work to try it out...and when I left and took it home, coworkers were sad to see it go since it was easy for all of us in the office to control.<br /><br />Once I used it at home, and given the price, this is really made for each TV you have in your house. So get 3 if you have that many TV's.<br /><br />Cons: Some of my favorite apps do not support it YET! But I know that will come if they want us customers to keep using their service(I'm looking at you Hulu). Also having to plug a power source into this device just makes the unit less pleasing to the eye...but what can you do?
B000XUBFE2|3.0|once again another Nazi story - can't say it was my favorite - but it was engrossing and was glad I read it - but, have no interest in re-reading it
B0042FZOFU|4.0|The movies are originals but was disappointed because they did not have disney movie rewards code inside and all original movie come with that!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is extreamly fun but highly addicting. Also once you use use all your gems there hard to replace, keep that in mind.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Game is very addictive and fun.  Shows you that games don't have to be high tech or 3D to be the funnest.  I would tell anybody that asks that this game is worth checking out.  It does get very challenging about level 20 so make sure you get the upgrades.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun. It is also somewhat addictive but definitely in a good way. :-)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Had a PC connected to my TV before but this small dongle does the work now - saves energy and also more convenient for the whole family to control from anywhere
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this series, its so witty and such a quality show. I love the chemistry between the characters and the actors do a phenomenal job. I love how John gets to put his military experience to work in the Hounds of Baskerville, he doesn't get much credit from Sherlock, so I appreciate it when it happens. Can't wait for season three!!!
B004TACMZ8|3.0|You need to have an x-ray to really see what's behind walls.  You can go left, right, up and down and get a different reading each time so it's anyones guess.  For the price I guess you get a little more sensitivity but don't expect much.  I'm going to just open the drywall to see what's in there.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|a total 5 star for me. this book left me on the edge of my seat the hole time. it wad sn amazing book and i recommend it to any one who like romantic, action book. on to book two!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|netflix, youtube work great.  need hbogo, etc.<br /><br />chromecast beta streaming tabs...performance is not acceptable.  Once these shortcomings are ironed out, chromecast will rule the world!
B0063M22QO|5.0|very challenging.  helps to keep my mind occupied on how to complete each level.  helps to pass the time wherever you go.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I can't remember the old Atari game this reminds me of. I think it was called Missile Command. Nostalgic with a nice new take.
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|They brought back K*. Ridiculous and so little plot this is one of the bad ones. They took the possibility of a decent scifi movie and made it like a comic book.<br />Phew!
B0089AD8IO|2.0|Story lines are good. Production level good. Lead actors merely adequate. Supporting cast, particularly the mother and boyfriend are annoying. Series 2 through 7 are much better, especially after departure of Piper. You could actually give this one a miss.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very nice product and easy to install. Easy integration with all the devices and TV. Hopefully few more apps will come in future.
B00DJYJRHG|2.0|The Shield is one great TV show. I got the Box set when it first came out. And what a mess it was.<br />Super bad packing of the disc. Everything was a mess. People were really P.O on it. 9 out of ten sets were a total mess.<br />The people that put it out, got a 800 number set up. And asked people to call it if they had a bad set. I was one.<br />They told me to send it all back. And sent me a paper to take to FedEx. And told me to give it all to FedEx.<br />I did so. In about two weeks I got a new Box Set. Everything is fine.<br />What they are putting out here is just the seasons put all in one deal.<br />This IS NOT THE BOX SET! The Box Set goes for over $140.00 On Amazon.<br />If you just want the seasons. And not the box set. Get this.<br />If you are seeking the Box set. Keep on looking..
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Action flick with a lot of reliance on the plot lines in the Matt Damon franchise.  The story development struck me as a bit uneven.  Performances are good but I did sense the absence of Matt Damon.  This is not the same as the James Bond movies where I find the different Bonds all bonded(sorry! I HAD to do that) into a continuity of persona.  It may be that the Bond movies do not attempt a real plot line linkage from movie to movie but rather carry the mystique as the unifying basis.  Having said that, I do not come away with a negative but rather feel both the money and the time were well rewarded.  Face it - the Damon series set a very high bar
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I love flowers and the joy they bring to our lives.  This book was beautifully written and the story and characters are embedded in my soul.
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|Production and presentation excellent.  Story line is consistent with my very limited knowledge of history and Scripture.  The film is entertaining and poignant story line.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I very hapy ,best ever,all the photos it gona stay for us life.very easy to get it and exelent application
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works with YouTube and Netflix (but so does my TV,  did, dvr) even with dsl.  Waiting for the sdk and seeing use on Chrome
B0058VW36U|5.0|looks of thinking and maneuvering... i love finding ways to get to the creature... the levels are so much fun
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app will not let me click the button next to News Feed that lets you choose Top Stories or Most Recent. I miss a lot of posts because of this. Please fix it!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|What an unusual telling of the life and times of Jesus! Somewhere just the other side of debunking. I am surprised to be finding this to be a real page turner.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just watched all 3 seasons and it is wonderful!! It takes you back to that era and keeps me wanting more!! Can't wait till season 4.
B00B2QA9TI|4.0|Great Version! I liked the cinematography, but there are some holes I think. Overall great acting, and worth watching! Enjoy!
B009CF3MEK|5.0|This one is an all time favorite,  has love kindness and the truth about these kind of people, take the new one and shove it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very fun. Easy to play. Reminds me of my childhood videogames. I played this game in a Commodore connected to black and white tv
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Another great read by Patrick rothfuss. Slightly less involved and exciting as the first one, but still a well written engaging novel. Can't wait for the next one!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game to play interesting and very engaging. with the game was longer and had mare rooms to play in.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I found it somewhat difficult to follow the story and figure out what was happening.  But it was entertaining and I liked how it ended.
B0014J8D9Q|2.0|It was a dark satire movie. Depressed me. No worth watching a 2nd time. Movie stunk up the room. Stinko!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|We are so excited to have this set and The price was a great deal! It has wonderful blu ray features and the quality is awesome!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|The movie stunk:  It was boring to watch.  I am glad, I did not waste money at the local theatre to see this movie.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Another good book, crisp plot and brisk dialog. While there is a formula, all of the books are enjoyable to read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice graphics. I enjoyed figuring out the order to use the objects and searching for hidden codes. My only complaint, to few levels. :)
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|A must see! I purchased the English speaking version of this movie. Funny and sad a definite must see for everyone
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's still in beta. Won't work for iOS chrome just yet. Waiting for a few more apps to pair up with it.
B001JU4S44|2.0|I couldn't remember the plot for the MI movie #2, so I watched again and remembered why I did not remember. This is easily worst of all the four movies.  Plot is alright, action sequences are too fat fetched and too dramatized.
0307463745|3.0|Rework is the second book from the 37 signals people, after their first book [[ASIN:0578012812 Getting Real: The smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application]]. Rework is a very short book. In page count it is 250 pages, but in content it is much less. The pages do not contain a lot of text and also there are quite some empty pages or pages with illustrations. All in all, you can finish this book relative quickly.<br /><br />The book is basically a collection of tips from the authors, who are two people working at 37signals, a company that got some of its fame for developing the Ruby on Rails web framework. The company is quite well known in the software industry for working \\"different\\". They focus on building smaller applications and focus on working with a few good people who are remote throughout the world.<br /><br />The book is arranged 9 topics and a introduction and conclusion. Each of the topics contain a bunch of short articles. Each of these articles is a few pages and they are basically one piece of advice related to a certain topic. They kind-of feel like simply blog posts, which is probably how some (all?) of them originated as the authors state the book is actually a by-product from their other work. Selling your by-product is one of the tips...<br /><br />Let me give some examples. The topic productivity contains small tips such as \\"interruptions is the enemy of productivity,\\" \\"meetings are toxic,\\" and \\"don't be a hero\\". Each of these contain a few pages of text related to that tip. For example, \\"meetings are toxic\\" explain the cost of meetings and states that they are usually in-efficient. Similarly, the same structure is followed throughout the book.<br /><br />All in all, I felt rework was an interesting book. It feels the authors try to be controversial and perhaps are at times. However, I felt slightly disappointed with the book myself, but this was partly because I've had read the earlier book [[ASIN:0578012812 Getting Real: The smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application]] and felt it was actually quite similar. In most tips, the authors make a good point about how work isn't always working and how we ought to rework work. I agree with that theme, yet didn't felt the book added much to the previous work. Because of that, I decided to stick with a 3-star review. The book is ok, especially when you hadn't read the previous work from the authors.The smarter, faster, easier way to build a successful web application]] and felt it was actually quite similar.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Easy read. Clever using view of dog to tell story. Also got great deal buying it for Kindle.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Wish there were more seasons to watch.  Also, watched the movie Serenity and loved it too.  Such a shame, that the series ended in one season.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very addicting.  Haven't played it in years and I'm really enjoying it on my Kindle Fire!  Can keep me up too late though.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It organized my Kindle now I know where to find certain files. It's a great addition. Good for organizing everything.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's a fun game that is easy at first handsomely gets harder and headdress you go on..upgrade slot it's fun and easy
B003G4W49C|4.0|Book makes you think. The sequels are even better. I would definitely recommend to people who don't usually read sci-fi.
0307010856|5.0|My kids loved this book. There was anticipation after every page. Too cute and kept my kids attention. Classic book!
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Action packed thriller. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.A most satisfying movie experience. 3D is effective  and color is bright
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I like that piano keyboard because I can & do play piano & teach some lessons. It is fun to do when I have time.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Sets the bar for 3D. Effects are amazing. Time flies while watching this and the amazing color makes you want to rewind and watch the scene again.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Having read reviews that stated how important this book was to readers I was expecting a bit more.  In part it could be that age has a role in my rating as I am 67.  The story was fair to middling, but the writers style was uninteresting to me.  Perhaps he wrote it to a young reader audience, but I have read young reader novels and found the language moving and eloquent.  To me, the language is flat and never rises above workman like prose.  I personally need more than an interesting plot to engage me.  I did finish it and may read a sequel if I need something light to fill a day.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I purchased this device because it promised integration with myfitnesspal.  This is not entirely true.  I was hoping that the calories burned recorded on the Withings Pulse would be transferred over to myfitnesspal but thhis just does not happen.  Myfitnesspal transfers the total calories I have consumed to Withings and thats it.  Withings transfers my weight over to myfitnesspal (assuming you have the scales linked).  So the only reason I purchased the Withings Pulse was because of this integration promise.  I have given it 4 stars only because apart from this issue it is actually a really useful bit of kit.  The steps recorded are pretty accurate.  It can detect when I go into a run as opposed to just walking.  I am able to take my heart rate although this is not constantly monitored.  The screen is difficult to read when in sunlight but very clear indoors.<br /><br />It records pretty accurately your sleep patterns but  you must remember to tell it you are going to sleep!  This is not done automatically.<br /><br />The Pulse is VERY SMALL.  it comes with a clip but you can just slip it into your pocket.  The wrist bracelet is only for the sleep monitoring function.  It is not for general wearing.  If Withings brought out a bracelet for everyday use, I think a lot more people would consider purchasing it.  Other activity trackers like Jawbone can be worn on the wrist.<br /><br />I do recommend this product.  But if like me, you use myfitnesspal and expected complete integration, forget it - for now!!  I am told that myfitnesspal are working on sorting this out but I am not holding by breath!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Good game but just kind of the same old thing over and over. Works great on my S3 though. Would recommend for a quick lobby game.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I am addicted to this game, playing 200 the first day. It is forgiving and allows you to go back to redo and undo. Nice logic puzzle and hard enough  to engage, yet not so hard as to be frustrating. The snipping scissors give it a sense of rationality.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I could not put this down! I read it straight through .. the twist were wild! I can't wait for another Gillian Flynn novel!
B00E193TM2|5.0|Loved it and thats about all there is to it ok so buy it and love it all day every day
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So easy and quick to setup and get running. Very easy to use. It's streamed everything from netflix without an issue and in HD.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|Very weird plot. I found it very disturbing that the murder of two young girls had such a gruesome twist at the end. The cutting, the family secrets, and the bizarre relationships in this book made it difficult to keep reading.
B004UPANAI|5.0|I have never been a comic book reader, but I love superhero / mutant films. This is the first movie based on a comic book character that makes me want to read the comics. I understand the screen adaptation is a bit different from the comics, but it is interesting and entertaining, and you can't always expect what works in a comic book to work exactly as is on film.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Starts out simple and quickly gets difficult. For anyone looking for a retro connection and a good way to kill time while waiting look no further than here.
B001OGWY1W|1.0|Saw this for two bucks and thought I would see what the hype was about.<br />Christian Bale absolutely sucks as Batman, period.<br />The set and car was nothing special despite being harped about previous to the films opening.<br />I suffered through 55 minutes and thought it was long enough.<br />And what about the famous Joker and Heath -- been there, done that.<br />Nothing special.<br />And if he hadn't jerked off while popping too many pills then he wouldn't have been mentioned.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I've seen so many \\"What if\\" movies that I stopped watching them, They were terrible and filled with bad B-Movie actors. I saw it at my public library and the woman standing beside me told me that it was overdue for about 2 mos. So she ordered it from here Amazon and I should take it out and watch it, If I am an TRUE Austen fan, I still don't know what she meant by that.<br /><br />But I rented from my library and I didn't think I would like it and my sister thought it would not be any good either. We first watched Pride and Prejudice and then we watched Lost in Austen. I tell you truly this was not only funny, but not to funny that it becomes ridiculous.<br /><br />Some parts made you cry, like Pride & Prejudice and Darcy is just as much pompus which we all love. Mr. Collins is a little bit weirder and pretentious as ever. BUY IT TODAY WITH NO REGRETS.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The video and stream quality is super. I was a bit skeptical in the beginning since I have tried before some Chinese models. Two thumbs up!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and addictive! The levels are just challenging enough to hold your attention without getting stuck. If puzzles, mystery and logic are your thing this game is perfect for you.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's a decent game I got for free using the daily free special<br />I don't know what else to say.but I hope I'm over 13 words
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This was an excellent buy! I love Phantom and this particular edition was wonderful.  The extra features in this dvd brought tears to my eyes.  Loved it.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|The newest incarnation of Evil Dead(released April/13),stars,among others,Jane Levy,Shiloh Fernandez,Lou Taylor Pucci and Jessica Lucas.Like the first and most famous version,this one stars a group of relative unknowns,sets them in a cabin in the woods and lets the evil overcome them,one by one.It's a modern twist on an old favourite,but with little to add that is new and original,this one just looks like what it is....a remake,and not a great one at that.<br />This story finds a group of youngins out in the woods,meeting up at an old cabin.Prior to this we are given a sequence where a father has to set his daughter afire and shoot her in order to purify her soul of demons.Of course this is the self same cabin the youngsters meet in.There are three girls and two guys(hey,I like those odds!).One is a nurse,who is there to help in another \\"purification\\" of sorts-the drying out of one of the guys sisters,Mia.While the treatment begins,one of the guys finds in the basement,amongst a bevy of dead hung animals,the Necronomicon,and starts trying to decipher it.His pronunciation of certain words summons a demon who sails towards the cabin and its eventual inhabiting of Mia.Mia tries to warn her friends of something untoward,but of course no one believes her.They all think she is trying to get out of her treatment.<br />Mia tries to make a run for it in one of the cars,but ends up in a swamp.Once out she is pursued by the demon,who catches her amongst a group of thorny branches,seemingly alive.The demon disgorges something vile from her mouth which enters Mia....and the possession is in full swing.The group meanwhile has been out on foot trying to find Mia,and when they do they return her back to the cabin unawares of what has taken place.When she scalds herself taking a shower her brother runs her out to the nearest hospital.But the river is swollen and they cannot get by.Back to the cabin they go and Mia goes on the war path,attacking the nurse and the other man.They lock her in the basement and the nurse becomes possessed.She is found cutting her face open and she attacks with a needle.The other man is forced to kill her in self defense.<br />While he is getting his wounds tended to by Mia's brother,the demonic Mia lures the third girl down into the cellar,and ends up biting her.She eventually escapes but her hand is totally infected and it spreads up her arm.She grabs an electric meat carver and cuts off her arm in desperation.She then attacks both men,who end up taking her down by dismembering her.Mia now becomes their target,and they corner her in the basement and tranquilizer her.But Mia's brother is the only one who comes out with Mia,as the other man dies.Mia is subsequently buried alive outside in a shallow grave.He waits just long enough and then revives her.The demon has left her,but inside the cabin he is attacked by his\\"dead\\" friend.While his screaming sister tries to get her brother out of the cabin,he ignites a gas can which engulfs both men and the cabin itself.Blood rains down outside as Mia is attacked by yet another demon out of the ground.The vehicle she tried to enter has now been upended and has trapped her hand.She pulls until her hand slips off and she attaches that stubby end to a chainsaw,which she uses to take care of the demon.The film ends as the sun comes up and the dawn of a new day.If you watch the credits to the end,Bruce Campbell himself makes an appearance there by giving us all his penultimate line from the original film....\\"Groovy\\".<br />That last bit by the Campbell-meister is the best thing about this film.However a younger gen who has never ever seen the original,let alone know who Bruce Campbell is(perish the thought!),will never get the reference.<br />The film goes along in the beginning quite well,but it slowly but surely becomes more contrived as it winds its way along.For instance,Mia tries to escape the cabin but ends up in the swamp.How does the group that comes looking for her know shehas only gone a certain distance,when she could have been long gone to the Yukon....and they're on foot to boot!? Another might be the pool of water in the basement.We have seen the basement before but noticed no such pool,it just conveniently appears.Then there is the moment Mia pulls her hand off which is stuck under the Jeep....like c'mon,pulls her hand off...for real? It just doesn't ring true.<br />Like the chainsaw,there are many throwbacks to the original and its creators.The first appearance of Mia is the prime example,as she is sitting on what looks like an /85 Olds,very close to the one from the original film and she is wearing a Michigan sweater.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are three featurettes as extras.<br />In conclusion,Raimi,Campbell and Tapert had a great chance to do something a little more original and fresh.The film starts out in the right direction but becomes more and more contrived as it winds its way along.I was expecting better.Maybe you can never go back...or maybe shouldn't go back.has only gone a certain distance,when she could have been long gone to the Yukon....and they're on foot to boot!?

B001HNE3NO|5.0|A friend recommend the book to me and I can see why she did.  It was easy reading and well written with a story line that wouldn't let me put the book down until it was finished.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|There are moments when we either reach out to dust off a book we bought long ago and never read, or stumble on a recommendation and it is just the right time to be reading that book. This one and this moment were just what I needed. It worked for me.<br /><br />I don't agree with everything in it and probably believe more along the line of the writer of the foreword but so many parts talked to me and I have been sharing quotes amongst friends and other artists. Get the stuff done.
B0057URWSQ|5.0|Fun, smart, funny. There are many legal shows but this is not the same old same. Amusing characters. \\"Harvey\\" may be a bit extreme but it doesn't make the episodes any less interesting or fun! Great series!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Its based off of the old atari game (for the younger gen that don't know) and is a great remake! Graphics are clean and gameplay is smooth. Basic touch and point gameplay with capability to use multi touchpoints. Seems like a good time waster! :)
B0001FR3IG|3.0|I saw the movie on TV so thought I would purchase it.  When I received the movie it wouldn't play. I had distroyed the return address so couldn't send it back.  However, shame on them for selling something they hadn't tried to play.  The movie is great but I still don't own it.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I didn't put it down for 2 days. I stayed in one place and read it all. Hated for it to end, and it touched me so deeply I was crying at the end. What an amazing story, the way it was written was different, at first it felt awkward, but it quickly made sense. This is a must read!!!
B009AY04A8|4.0|I've noticed some spelling mistakes (such as scull and bones) an one time asking for a saber when they wanted a cutlass, but it's still a decent game. I wonder, though, if it'll keep asking for a review after I give it one like the rest of the Nevosoft titles I have do...<br /><br />(EDIT: Yes, yes it still does ask me to leave a review after I have done so.)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game. Yes I'm old enough to have played the original arcade game! I don't mind saying that I still got it!

0307887898|4.0|Its a good and very valid point the book emphasizes which every entrepreneur should now. However its quite repetitive and therefore way too long
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game. A little slow but tons of fun. You just have to be patient. Great levels but can take awhile if you don't spend money.

B0088W6Y7K|5.0|I am a BIG Stargate SG-1 fan and loved when they came out with this addition to the series. The idea we are a second generation of an advanced civilization isn't to far fetched in our own reality. I was hoping stargate universe would last but it ended after its first season... Bring Atlantis back!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Great movie all the great american badasses in it. looks very realistic and great old aircraft and all american badasses...

B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|the book was just like &#34; he went to the temple&#34; Nothing was really outstanding. I could read the Bible and get more. It was like an every day thing and no serious analysis
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|When the best feature about a piece of technology is the price, its not too helpful a review. So let me explain. I didn't need this, having a cable connecting my iPad to both my TV's for watching Netflix and NHL games, along with anything else on the iPad. But for the cost of a parking ticket, it was too cool to pass-up. I have gotten used to using it for Netflix and YouTube and it definitely performs as advertised. But unless they integrate other media sources into Chromecast...and quickly (NHL starts October 2nd), my rating will drop to it's OK and just be more careful where you park.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|It was wonderful love it love it love it . Pretty cool book love the drama and all that stuff

0399165274|5.0|When you begin your career writing Cold War thrillers like [[ASIN:B003GDFQX4 The Day Of The Jackal]] and post-war Nazi hunts like [[ASIN:0451239393 The Odessa File]] keeping up with the changing geo-politcal landscape over the past fifty years is a daunting task for even acknowledged masters of the genre. Somehow Frederick Forsyth has evolved with the times.The Nazi's are all dead or caught, the Iron Curtain rusted away but the heart of the political thriller-a global threat and a contemporary superman to oppose the threat-still beats.<br /><br />Terrorism we are told by historians, political scientists, and military strategists, is the weapon of choice in the struggle against the strong. What makes terrorism effective are not body counts, but the uncertainty and fear it generates. Religious terrorism, the kind practiced by extremists in the Middle East, is even more terrifying because of its ability to ensnare the young and offer them glorify for committing unspeakable crimes.<br /><br />Thus it is with a young imam known only as the Preacher. As a result of is powerful message delivered to the faithful American and British civil servants and politicians are being killed at an ever accelerating rate. The President has placed this unknown individual on the kill list, a designation which means  his warfare against the West has ensured a military solution. Lieutenant Colonel Kit Carson, a young marine office detached to an American version of the British secret service is ordered to find and neutralize the Preacher. Carson is the Tracker.<br /><br />The battlefield of today includes both cyberspace and desert. Little by little, using all of the resources of America and its allies the Tracker pursues the Preacher. The tale is taught and tense. Even though the endgame is totally predicable, this latest thriller deserves that designation. This book is thrilling.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is not a great book but it is a fun read. Not much character development, but very readable
B00992CF6W|5.0|you can craft picks and mine diamonds. you can  build house's and make double Chests plant trees make gardens and more.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's not always flawless but when it works it's quite handy. The only real downside is that it requires external power but that's not a big deal.<br /><br />Streams from various Chromecast apps but just Youtube alone is already a nice experience. Maybe you're getting what you paid for but the experience is well beyond $35.
0062255657|5.0|This is a beautiful -- and sometimes slightly disturbing -- book filled with mental morsels that children know and adults sometimes half remember. And I will admit that I cried, perhaps, just a bit when I read this paragraph near the end of the book:<br /><br />\\"I finally made friends with my father when I entered my twenties. We had so little in common when I was a boy, and I am certain I had been a disappointment to him. He did not ask for a child with a book, off in its own world. He wanted a son who did what he had done; swam and boxed and played rugby, and drove cars at speed with abandon and joy, but that was not what he wound up with.\\"<br /><br />As I lost my father just four months ago, and we were two very different people, this paragraph all but reached out grabbed me by my shoulders. I swear it did. I was already just a little sad about the story coming to an end (I read this book very slowly, savoring each chapter), so I was all too vulnerable by the time I turned the page and read that paragraph. Twice.<br /><br />I will be re-reading this book for some time to come.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love all of the escape games, and I especially enjoyed this one because I could keep the sound off while playing.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|A must watch. \\"Suits\\" has to be one if the greatest shows I have ever seen. Top notch acting and great plots.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Don't understand why the YouTube app is available on my wife's iPad but not my Kindle.  Annoying that connecting via Silk browser is hit or miss and have to rely on yet another non-OEM app to get a part of the functions of the web site.  Vids do come through pretty good, though.
0375869026|3.0|I liked the book and the characters but had to rate it 3 stars because once again a dog has to die in a children's book.  What is wrong with authors of children's books and their obsession with killing animals???  I almost stopped reading all together as a child because the animals dying BROKE my heart!  Thank God I learned to avoid books with animals in them and ended up becoming a very passionate reader....It is too bad because I was hoping to put this book in my school library when I was done reading it but now I can't.  Another great story missed.... message to children's authors: STOP KILLING ANIMALS!
B00DL47RQ2|5.0|No computer generated charters, no explosions , no car chases , no naked breasts just great writing, acting and directing. Something cooperate America could never approve. I thought this was one of Allen's best movies. The acting was breathtaking. To have the scope of talent to go from Midnight in Paris to Blue Jasmine makes me an Allen fan forever. Don't waste time reading the reviews, if you love the art of movie making, just see this movie. It is a must.

B00B89LZ4C|4.0|I like this action figure to commemorate the Breaking Bad TV show (Walter White's alter ego character, Heisenberg). Nice removable hat and sunglasses. Wish that the head could turn or the arms could move. Still like it though! Well done.

031632406X|3.0|&#34;Lone Survivor&#34; provides us with a situation, rather than a narrative, and not well drawn out military types, instead of deeply fleshed characters. The book, through the words of Marcus Luttrell, tells of the failed Seal Team excursion, Operation Redwings, in which three of the four members lost their lives, with the Lone Survivor, Marcus Luttrell, providing us the situation in which the events occur. The writing is somewhat uneven, parts needing description have none, and others too much, the effects of certain causes not explained, and many military events needing more explanation and analysis.<br /><br />But other than the unremarkable writing style, the needless repetition, the spotty descriptions, and the military-free jargon, is that the situations lead to far more unanswered questions that are not reflected upon by the co-authors and that is somewhat off-putting in a book which should be about our nation's heroes, but might lead many to conclude that these warriors were in fact poorly trained and poorly skilled operators who failed in their mission to fulfill their objective. The book never answers so many questions that keep popping up in the book without proper explanation or reflection:<br /><br />1) Why even mention the term &#34;liberal media&#34;? It is always connected to a political firestorm and especially in the light in which the author's book must be sold through this &#34;liberal media.&#34; Why even bring it up? What could it possibly serve to start infusing the book with political overtones from the very beginning? These are supposed to be warriors on a mission to safeguard the country. They should have no political leanings other than in service to the President of the United States, regardless of political party.<br /><br />2) In an effort to make Marcus seem more like an average guy who was more determined than all others, it lacks a certain honesty to realize that not everyone can pass the physical rigor of the necessary amount of push-ups and pull-ups needed to become America's finest warriors. One must need a certain baseline of physical stature, no matter how determined one is; if a person can't do more than 30 push-ups, it doesn't matter how much determination one has; one must know their physical limitations. Even in Adam Brown's life story, he specifically mentions how many push-ups and pull-ups he did to make DevGru, and when one is not a member of Devgru, I guess he is not that determined after all.<br /><br />3) In all the books about military operations, I have never read of any Special Forces operators rambling on about the ROE (the Rules of Engagement). Special Forces have goals and objectives and are so fiercely determined, they are trained to carry out their mission with the highest sense of fulfillment and bring their team home.<br /><br />4) Why does Marcus repeatedly carry on about &#34;God&#34; wanting him to be with his rifle, and his rifle is always right there, but &#34;God&#34; takes the lives of his comrades so easily without any further spiritual reconciliation?<br /><br />5) Why is the &#34;fast rope&#34; kicked out to them? Isn't there a rule or procedure to follow? Why was this done and not done in all other cases?<br /><br />6) Why go on and on about stealth, and tragically ironic, be discovered by simple teenager goat herders? Why was the mission not aborted? Can the enemy take away from this that to defeat Special Forces operators, the enemy simply has to disperse goat herders all over the country to discover Special Forces teams all over Afghanistan? Is that all it takes to halt our nation's most skilled soldiers?<br /><br />7) Why was anything even voted on by the Seal team? Isn't there a chain of command that must be followed? Why was there anything even put to a vote and not one team member telling the Lt. to make a decision? What was that all really about? I don't think the truth will ever be known<br /><br />8) And most importantly, with repeated &#34;attention to detail&#34; characteristics that Seal operators must have, why was the name of the Operation in the book incorrect? It was &#34;Operation Redwings&#34;, not &#34;Operation Redwing&#34;.<br /><br />9) I don't know how a Vietnam veteran, Shelton, all of a sudden, has months on his hands to actually train Luttrell in the first place. I know many veterans who have busy, active, and social lives, and can not just drop what they do to train a high school kid, and kids for that matter, to get into shape for a military program. This seems to be very mysterious.<br /><br />These unanswered questions came up less than halfway through the book,that near the end, I had far more questions to things I should have received answers to. I think Adam Brown's &#34;Fearless&#34; is the book that &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; should have become.ion to detail&#34; characteristics that Seal operators must have, why was the name of the Operation in the book incorrect?

B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This book turned out not how I thought. I was worried that I was going to hate this but I really loved it. I can relate cause I know people like this and I know these feelings. I smiled so much through this book. It's sad and made me mad at times but such a great book. It's a different love story and such a refreshing story. Very well written!
B008RKGF1I|2.0|Watched this when it came out but unfortunately it doesn't seem to have stood the proverbial test of time. Jennifer Beals was adorable tho. With the prominence of dance these days it's interesting to see the dance-themed films of the 80's.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I found the many interviews of the book a great format to tell of the zombie apocalypse. I loved World war Z.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Better to be tardy to the party than to never attend at all, right? That pretty much sums my main stream reading up in a nutshell. It seems like I am always way behind the fan club when it comes to my reading. I just read City of Bones, despite numerous people telling me how awesome it was. I probably would have waited even longer to read this, had it not been for the movie coming out in a few weeks. (I have this thing about reading the book before I see the movie.)<br /><br /> That being said, I finally sat down and started reading City of Bones.... and I finished it a few days later. I would have had it read in less time than that, but I kept being dragged away from my reading spot by friends. When I did get to read, I couldn't put it down. I even found myself trying to read it all bleary-eyed and delusional from lack of sleep. Cassandra Clare has a way with words!<br /><br /> The story grabbed me from the start. Since I had seen the movie trailer at least three times before starting the book, I had a little something to go on. (I am going to stop right now though and say how horrible I think the casting for Jace is. He is nothing like the book character. I seriously hate Hollywood's choices sometimes. I can also deal with Clary, but I think her hair should be a brighter red.) My favorite aspect of the book has to be the wit behind the characters. Jace and Clary were uproariously funny at times. It did not seemed forced, either. I was impressed that there was a natural flow to the dialogue that seemed natural, almost as if I was talking with my group of friends. How can you not connect with the characters when they come across like that? Here is an example:<br /><br />\\"So when the moon's only partyly full, you only feel a little wolfy?\\" Clary asked.<br /><br />\\"You could say that.\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, you can go ahead and hang your head out the car window if you feel like it.\\"<br /><br />Luke laughed. \\"I'm a werewolf, not a golden retriever.\\"<br /><br /> Love this! I seriously chuckled so many times as I read this book.<br /><br /> I also want to give props for the world building. The Shadowhunter aspect was original and captivating. A lot of effort was made to make the modern world blend in with this super secret alternate reality. Everything worked well together and was believable. You could imagine this setting as you read.<br /><br /> Obviously, I enjoyed City of Bones. I'm hooked. I shall be reading the rest of this series soon because I need more Jace.I seriously chuckled so many times as I read this book.<br /><br /> I also want to give props for the world building.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I kept seeing all the buzz on this book and thought it might be worth a read. I normally stick to mysteries with a bit of science-fiction but I took a chance. Flynn writes in a way that provides a vivid picture, which I liked. But the plot was mediocre and the book's ending seemed similar to that of a bad sit-com who's funding gets pulled and it's ended halfway through the season, leaving the audience regretting the time they've devoted thus far. Just not for me.
B007AL48UK|4.0|This is fun to play on the Kindle, the summer-themed characters on the tiles are cute and make it all the more enjoyable. Sounds are not annoying. Multiple layouts to challenge the skills.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very addicting game. Easy to play and interact with other players. Although you can buy more credits to play this is an easy game to play for free.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The writer's style in this book does not appeal to me.  I don't care for the &#34;skipping back and forth&#34; between protagonists.
B00B935SUY|4.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this documentary on Sound City.  The film was interesting, informative and fun.  The film was well produced and we really liked the interviews especially Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty.  We both really liked Stevie's contribution to the film, her new song rocks and she never sounded better.  We also really liked Rick Springfield's The Man That Never Was.The song with Dave Growl really stands out.  I think it is one of Rick's heaviest rocking tunes.  My wife's favorite artist is Rick.  I am only a moderate fan however, I think it is one of Rick's best tunes.  The Foo Fighters backing the song really give it a lot of energy.  Paul McCartney's contribution was a standout as well.  Overall the film was very good, my only problem was there was only about 30 minutes of performing in the film.  The last part of the film really takes off once the artists perform in the film.  Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails was another standout in the film.  Technically I think the man is a musical genius using computers to aid in compositions.

B001OMJGD0|4.0|Liked Brandon Routh as Superman. The story line was a little predictable but overall the movie was good. Nice movie for a rainy day.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Requiem for a Dream depicts the lives of four characters from summer through winter. Ellen Burstyn gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Sarah Goldfarb, a widow living alone who won a chance to appear on television and is trying to lose weight so that she can fit into her husband's favorite red dress for the event. Her son, Harry Goldfarb, is an heroin addict who tries to make money in the drug trade with buddy Tyrone to fund his girlfriend Marion's clothing business. The movie goes in a downward spiral as the four addicts are dragged deeper into their habits, each of them finding themselves increasingly paranoid and helpless, ending up in increasingly compromising positions.<br /><br />Darren Aronofsky's directing is pure genius. Each time the characters take a hit, the screen cuts to a fast editing of drugs being consumed, pupil dilating and cells pulsing. This is repeated a few times in the film to emphasize the never ending cycle of drug use. I also like the use of dreams and illusions in the movie. Each character is absorbed in their own dreams of happiness while their realities are rapidly deteriorating. I find that an apt parallel of drug use which offers promises of pleasure. The second half of the movie is hauntingly poignant as the scenes of dreams, reality and drug use intersect one another.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is very realistic, which makes it gritty. But isn't that the purpose of the movie?

B002AKPECW|5.0|I loved this book. I usually don't read science fiction but a friend recommended it to me and I really loved it. It was creatively written by a good author. There is nothing about this book that I disliked. I just hope he writes a sequel for it. I would recommend this to anyone who loves science fiction or anyone who wants to try something different. This book has changed my preferences on what I read. Now I am more apt to read science fiction.

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Haven't watched it yet but have seen parts at friends.  Looking forward to it, all 3 seasons a B-day gift for my husband.<br /><br />Thanks
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Bought it for the grandbabies, and they really loved it. I wonder why they don't make more musicals like this. I give it the highest rating and would love to find some more old-timey musicals.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This is the perfect date night film.  Enough gun play for the guys with enough glamour & romance for the gals with fun mixed in.  Perfect for couples who are older & recognize the stars while still being enjoyed by younger ones.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I've had a good time playing this game.  Its kind of addicting.  I would like more upgrade options but its fun regardless.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I love this game it is very fun i suggest that you buy this game these words are just so i can get the review done
B00992CF6W|5.0|My granddaughter sits for hours playing with this program, showing it has more staying power than any of the other games she has installed on her Kindle Fire.  It appears to be electronic building blocks and I have not seen anything inappropriate for a child, so that sets my mind at ease.
B008XK69S6|1.0|I copied some media from my home computer to my Kindle fire hd 8.9 and this application could not find the media.  I used ES file explorer to manually open the media and then the player couldn't play the files.  It may be great for some but for my purposes it was completely useless.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Pitch Perfect is on up there with Mean Girls and She's the Man. It's funny and full of girl power!
B007JZGIMS|5.0|In my search for an app that can browse my kindle fire hd 8.9 and play any audio media that I have loaded onto my tablet I came across the rocket music player.  I used the freeware version previously on an ASUS android pad that I had and I loved the app.  The functionality and interface are intuitive and not only does it do a proper search for any new media but it has several options for manually navigating to the media to be played.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My daughter loves this game but for three days it has not let her in it starts to loss then goes right back out please fix this then I will change my rating
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Its an update of the odd missile defense. fairly fun with the upgrades. Matter of fact you get 50 pts for reviewing the game
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great little time waster.  Picked it up on the free weekend and I'm hooked!  Will recommend to my mom, dad, brother, dog sister
B003THHIEM|4.0|Both Castle and Beckett showed ability to see into past experiences of others that shape present behavior and a person's character.  This first season laid a compelling foundation for an intriguing, controversial relationship for future seasons.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Brendan Fraser does a fantastic job in the movie along with Christopher Walken.<br /><br />Imagine locking underground for your whole life until you are 35 years old thinking that the world above was wiped out and you are about to emerge for the first time... Let the comedy begin.. Oh yeah and they throw in Alicia Silverstone to give this movie the romantic comedy flavor, but that is easy to set aside while you enjoy the rest of the movie.
B005PK57IK|5.0|But thank goodness I can get the DVD's so I can catch up in time for the new season.  Awesome series!
0316228583|1.0|Too wordy .  Too many characters introduced rather poorly.  Actually boring with a slow pace that never picked up.  Would not recommend.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Most games I finish in hours. This one was so different and strangely complex that I would give up &amp; come back for days! I finally solved it though, so I have to recommend it. It's not a hidden object game but you search areas for clues to solve mini puzzles or objects for later use. The goal is to get back out of Wonderland. There were clues which I used A LOT, a map that was very helpful &amp; a journal for notes. Apparently there may be a 'part 2' which I will buy. If you appreciate different games that take time then this is worth the $2 by far!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|It's very fun but kind of aggravating when you don't win though. Other than that it's a really cool fun game
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've got one hooked up to my projector and haven't had to use my AppleTV or my PS3 for watching content since, which is a very welcome simplification.<br /><br />I have to more hooked up to HDMI audio extractors for wireless music playback in two different locations in my house.  Would be nice if the Chromecast had an audio out as well, but this setup works fine.<br /><br />There have been a few little UI glitches, but I'm sure they'll iron those out with time.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with Chromecast!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|small, neat, easy to setup and use, and pretty powerful in streaming from available apps.  however for it to be more useful it needs to have more apps available for streaming.  i'm sure more apps are coming, just have to be patient.  very good and low price product.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Reminds me of the old Atari game Missile Command  May even b a little better. I luv this app. And only took a fee minutes to get hooked.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|Not as funny as Boondock Saints, but definitely good action film. Love the cast! Sean Patrick Flannery & Norman Reedus did it again!
B0019IB0II|5.0|A fantastic & insightful read. Well worth the time and money invested. Would highly recommend it to anyone interested in a good book!
B00CBN6B9S|5.0|I have read and used this book in the classroom. The students really responded to the alliteration, simple sentence structure, and illustrations.<br />It is interactive and fun and can be read one-on-one or to a whole class.<br />I highly recommend it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun game easy to pick up and the upgrades add some depth.<br /><br />Could use more enemy types.  Can get old after awhile.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game its awesome its very great love it the game is plain amazing fun for everyone keeps you entarned for hours funbfor everyone
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Listened to it immediately, great tunes and done well. Highly Recommended! Nice to here someone who has a real passion for music.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I don't yet know what to make of the author's deeply spiritual experience, but this was book I couldn't put down.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|excellent product works as advertised I would recommend this to others interested in streaming content from there smartphones tablets or computers
B005VMSATA|1.0|Poor plot, script, acting, and sadly special effects were just mediocre CGI that seemed more suited for a low budget PS3 game rather than a big budget movie. Wish I could get reimbursed for my wasted time first and money second.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of the most exciting games to me, and it's relaxing too. It's an escape for me because I get in the game and tend to forget my problems. I love playing it and hate missing a day without playing it. I love collecting my daily bonus and credits. I love the daily free tournament. Only problem I have is when I'm interrupted when playing this game. I wish there was a pause button while playing, as you have to play every round with no outside interruptions so you won't miss numbers being called.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I really like theses notebooks. There are different ones to label and different colors to choose from. I also like that I can put my notes under a password.
B00BTHWFHE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this new Black Sabbath album.I bought my first Sabbath album back in 1973 which was &#34;Paranoid&#34; followed later by &#34;Vol 4&#34; which to this day are my favorite 2 Black Sabbath albums!<br />This new release has several tracks that sound exactly like &#34;Vol 4&#34;!!! which made my rating go from liking it alot to Loving it! If you love old Black Sabbath you'll love this new 13 album.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|I didn't. Like this game at all and I'm pretty good with most of the games. I wouldn't recommend thus to anyone
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Jason Newsted kicks ass on his second release. The second track &#34;Soldierhead&#34; is the reason I bought this album.It rocks out as much as any Metallica song I've heard. It has some catchy stop breaks and a killer groove throughout the song.The rest of the album is pretty heavy but this track is my favorite! Being a musician(Drummer) I would be proud to have my name on this album,way to go Jason! Also,Jason sings Lead Vocals as well as Killer Base!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Takes me back to atari. Classic with a twist. Upgrades help speed of missile amount held<br />Area of explosion. Fast paced way to past time.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Being a recent fan of AV7 I have now(in the last 6months) collected &#34;Live In The LBC-Diamonds In The Rough&#34;,&#34;City Of Evil&#34;,&#34;Nightmare&#34; and now the 2007 release &#34;Avnged Sevenfold&#34; this release is my second favorite with &#34;Nightmare&#34; as my favorite.If you like AV7 and don't have this one, you should add it to your collection-its a must and you won't be sorry!
B005HSL626|4.0|It's interesting to play and I had fun playing this game. Everyone should play it at least once. They need to download it.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love this All in one Mahjong, there are so many designs that it`s hard to decide what to do first.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very fun,  addictive, and easy for everyone. I need more words for this review sorry bit this take is still amazing.
B003EYVXTQ|4.0|I ordered this movie not really expecting much, but had been told it was pretty good, and was pleasantly surprised. This movie has a good story line and some good acting. I can understand why it was chosen for best picture! Jennifer Lawrence was really good in this movie. I would recommend others to watch it.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I'm 72% into this book on my Kindle and find it facinating. &#34;Pillars:&#34; is my favorite of all time, and this rates up there. I've read almost all of Follett's books. One of my favorite authors.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|This was a good cd it sound group nothing but good music on the cd ant body should love it
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|A really great book kept me interested from start to finish and what a cliff hanger can't wait for book 4 please hurry.
034580404X|5.0|Half way thru the first book...can't put it down! It is nice to set down and read...I hope the others are just as good!
0062124293|4.0|This was a very entertaining read. I laughed out loud so many times. Caitlin is bawdy, blunt, and honest, even painfully so. The title is appropriated, as this is a feminist memoir but Caitlin also delves into the perplexing physical, emotional, cultural, and psychological minefield of being a woman. The early chapters of physical maturity got the most laughs out of me, as well as the descriptions of her large family. Loved it!<br /><br />While I agree with most of her feminist principles, namely the litmus test: Do men have to worry about this?, there are a couple of ideas that I disagree with. I, as a feminist, do have a problem with porn. I don't think there should more of it, as Caitlin states. Also, I have a problem with her seemingly contradictory beliefs of it's ok to sleep your way to the top but stripping for money is not.<br /><br />Aside from that and a seemingly odd obsession with Lady Gaga, I found this book to be refreshing, enlightening, and very funny. I can see myself reading it again and again.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Paul Rudd and Lesley Mann are real and hilarious in this movie.  I was hoping for a Seth Rogen cameo, but his character is only briefly mentioned
B00785P2QC|4.0|Outdoor tipoff ugly icky<br />Pewdiepie<br /><br />Back HiHi kick Kuhn unova Johnny thinking tv f2f gun Rubik login<br /><br />It'll bunk Kuhn
B0094MQHUW|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in years and I still love it.  Still scares and entertains just as good than I first saw
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This seems to be a pretty good app.<br />I haven't had any advertisement issues yet. Only h ad the game 2 days though.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|but we all know Canada is the true hero in this story.  Love the running joke and the soundtrack rocks and each song seems perfectly timed
B00004S35Z|5.0|I have the original album and bought this to use on my cd player. It is a timeless album, it will last for years after we are all long gone.
B00B7G3Y4U|4.0|PA3 left me with questions PA4 did not really answer, rather, just cause me to have more questions.  I was hoping for more creepiness like the first 2 when the demon was unexplained.  oh well, the girl is at least cute
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I said it before, I wish I heard about this artist years ago, but I am feeling so lucky that I had the opportunity to  hear him. I love the 2 CD's I bought.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I enjoy this movie time and time again... It has great action scenes and I really really like it... Great job...
B001BKVWYG|5.0|It is sad that it has taken so many years to get this great music heard in this country. I was playing my CD this morning.  I love it.
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|Almost as good as going to an observatory. In some cases even better. Wonderful educational tool for parents with children and adults will love it on their own.
B00E1LT41K|5.0|Being an novice student of British history, I am always eager when any new show comes out relating to this topic.  While this is historical fiction it does follow history quite accurately.  The casting is phenomenal!  I will address some of the characters that really stood out for me.  I am NO authority these are just my opinions! :-)<br /><br />Rebecca Ferguson portrays a brave and beautiful Queen Elizabeth.  Her performance is commanding and powerful.  She really portrays the strength and courage of her character during a very dangerous time in British history.<br /><br />Amanda Hale presents viewers with a pious and scheming Lady Beaufort.  She does an excellent job of conveying her love for God and her son while showing the ugly side of greed and bad behavior.<br /><br />Aneurin Barnard plays Richard Duke of Gloucester.  His character evolves from one that seems sweet and caring as the Duke however, when he becomes King Richard we see him transform  into power hungry and vile creature.<br /><br />Max Irons as King Edward....I'm not sure about the casting with this actor.  While he does a good job acting, I don't feel that he physically fits the part.  Don't get me wrong he is very handsome he just doesn't fit the appearance of a King during the 1400's.  The portrayal of King Edward is one of a womanizer (which he was) but his real character was much richer than this.  I would have liked to see this developed more in the script.<br /><br />David Oakes as George Duke of Clarence....PERFECT casting!  I can't see any other actor doing a better job!  He plays the jealous, conniving, backstabbing younger brother of King Edward with such conviction.<br /><br />Janet McTeer as Jacquetta Woodville mother to Queen Elizabeth.  McTeer plays the mother figure with style and grace, portraying a character that is determined to see her daughter and family succeed.  The love that she has for her daughter is very palpable.<br /><br />James Frain as Lord Warwick....James Frain, enough said. A great period actor; he never disappoints.  His portrayal of Warwick is thoughtful and insightful.<br /><br />If you are looking for a juicy story filled with murder, scandal, backstabbing, and scheming....there is nothing like a story that really happened.  I recommend you give this show a try. ;-)
0399165274|3.0|The characters are male action figures, good looking without personality.  Women are almost non-exisistent, Convienently killed off or motivation dismissed as soccer mom needing to pick up her children
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love this game...when it works usually it just freezes or crashes.  please fix it... id love for it to work so I could use it!
B004LWZW7E|4.0|Andrew Niccol's small oeuvre as a filmmaker deals with pressing contemporary concerns, but usually in an allegorical framework. &#34;In Time&#34; is in that vein: in the future, a genetically-modified humanity uses time as money, with the rich potentially immortal, and the rest hardscrabbling for another hour or even a handful of minutes every day. In short, what life is increasingly becoming like for all of us today, as the gap between the 99% & the 1% grows wider & wider -- the poor struggle & die so that the rich live may in obscene comfort.<br /><br />Niccol begins promisingly by touching on some of the issues such a culture would raise: the anomie & fear of risk-taking that would cocoon the rich, creating a stagnant society averse to creativity & change; the psychological & emotional jarring of having several generations in a family all looking 25 years old; the emphasis on speed & doing things among the poor, leaving no time for contemplation because everything is focused on the next few minutes, rather than on the long-term. So far, so good.<br /><br />Even the hero-bucks-the-system aspect of the film begins well, as protagonist Will Salas uses an unexpected gift of time given in response to his compassion to challenge the powers-that-be. The problem arises when the film starts becoming too much of a chase/action film. Granted, part of this was obviously intentional, to emphasize the need for people to keep moving constantly, unable to stop & think for any length of time. But I think it was also done intentionally to make the film more blatantly commercial, as the ads emphasized the action, the better to draw in more viewers who don't necessarily want to have to think about what they're watching. This is a delicate balance, and for me it never quite fell into place. I wanted more exploration of the ideas than I got -- though I'll admit that they kept the suspense cranked up quite well. It's just that the film tends to get a bit too slick & glib when it should be evoking a deeper emotional response instead, as Niccol's previous &#34;Gattaca&#34; did.<br /><br />Still, even with that shortcoming, it's a film worth watching & pondering afterwards. The parallels to contemporary life are clear & upsetting, as they're meant to be. If the premise intrigues you at all, then you'll get enough to start you thinking -- on that basis, recommended!be evoking a deeper emotional response instead, as Niccol's previous &#34;Gattaca&#34; did.<br /><br />Still, even with that shortcoming, it's a film worth watching & pondering afterwards.

0452289963|5.0|This book was noted in Oprah's book clubs and heard a lot of great things about this book.  I amexcited to read the it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Game is well implemented and very enjoyable for an old Missile Command fan. Requests for ratings were not overly frequent nor obnoxious. As others have said, the new take on an old theme is done well. I got it as a FAOTD, but it is worth $0.99.<br />Lookout did not find a virus.
B005QUQP76|5.0|I was initially very pleased with the mouse, I bought it in February this year, and it lasted about 3 months without problems. But after 3 months I had to uninstall and install the driver a couple of times, had to plug it in and unplug it a couple of times to make it work, at first, I tough it was my PC, my USB port, but those were brand new 3.0 ports.<br /><br />I tested the ports, and I got to the conclusion I've gotten a lemon, even then I had to say that the problem was very rare every now and then, I decided to keep it, since it was like once or twice a week I had to unplug-plug the mouse back in the port.<br /><br />Now, after 6 months of regular use, it doesn't work, simply stopped working, very sad since I had the illusion of keeping it, even after knowing it had a flaw.<br /><br />I tried contacted the seller &#34;Corsair&#34; for a warranty, but they have not answered any of my e-mails, too bad, that's a 1 star review for you, I'd give you probably 4 stars but you just can't sell a $60 mouse that last 6months.<br /><br />I researched the web and it seems like it's a common problem, they advice you to re-install the software and solve the problem, and if you're lucky it will, but probably like me, you won't be so lucky, so re-installing the software will just give you &#34;please connect M60 to the computer and try again&#34; error.<br /><br />I was really please with the features of the mouse, changing profiles with the dedicated buttons, I could just lift the mouse, it wont go all over the screen, it was a good (and expensive) 6 months experience.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />Corsair finally answered back, and they replaced the M60 with a M65, free of charge. If I loved my M60, I definitively love my M65 way more.<br />Thank you corsair for a awesome customer service.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|We truely enjoyed this movie a lot.  It was definitely worth the rental.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Enjoy!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Interesting twist on a classic game. Very fun, moves quickly. Can't wait to see how far I can get before it's just too fast for me
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I look forward to getting one for each TV in my home.  The price is reasonable, and the utility high.
0143123173|5.0|An excellent book with interesting characters. Walt Longmire is a much more complex character with a dry humor and outlook on life.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I actually saw this at the theater and can't wait for my Blu-Ray to arrive! This is the type of film you pop into the blu-ray player on a quiet, calm, cool evening and kick back letting the director take you on a fantasy journey full of beautiful women, ugly aliens and great effects. Great fun, just don't forget the popcorn!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game always keeps me going I love it its challenging because u have to kno exactly what they are trying to say
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Handy too for mirroring, I expect developers to start incorporating this into several of their apps soon. For the price and the size of it, I don't you can go wrong with this. It does just what it says it does.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game I have ever played but it should get a update so you can have more things and in the creative there should be more than 4 animals and there should be mobs but you should definitely get this app
B00005JLEU|5.0|Liked it before, and glad I bought a copy finally. I was able to select to watch in Japanese too, which was nice.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|All I can say is WOW!! The first couple of chapters started out slow, for me, and I almost stopped reading it but MAN, I am so glad I didn't. Amanda went through some things that no girl should ever have to endure. She overcame all the issues she went through and made one of the sweetest decisions a person should never have to make. Well worth the read!! WARNING: Grab the box of tissues for the end!!! It about tore my heart from my chest!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Click n blast fun u control the rockets etc. You can upgrade n more, and it'll keep you entertained for A long time I believe
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Very fun! good time managing type games. teaches responsibilities in a sense. along with just being fun to get lost in the game and take you mind off things IRL for a bit.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Just purchased today. This is a fun game. I would recommend this to everyone. This is good for hand/eye coordination for children.
1590172213|5.0|This is a low fantasy time-travel novel published in 1969. The story is simply told in a clear prose style. It is about a girl in a boarding school in the late 1950s who sleeps in a bed and wakes up as someone else in 1918 - the girls change places from day to day until the girl from the 50s gets stuck in 1918 when that girl is removed from the school. The rest of the narrative deals with her adjustment to living in 1918 and her attempts to get back. It's really a lovely tale, well told. I was immediately taken with Charlotte and the other characters. I believed them as characters and felt that the dynamics of their relationships rang true. There is a s&eacute;ance and the armistice and suspense and fantasy. Low fantasy narratives are a passion - extraordinary things happening to everyday people - \\"The Twelve And The Genii\\" by Pauline Clarke was a recent favorite, \\"The Children of Green Knowe\\" by L.M. Boston, \\"Tuck Everlasting\\" by Natalie Babbitt are also highly recommended.
B00EAI9CSY|4.0|Beautifully shot, acted and directed.  The pace of the story was a little slow, but it's a minor flaw. I actually watched it twice in 24 hours, and picked up on so much more.  If you enjoyed Let the Right One In (foreign version), go for this one.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very well written, absorbing story.  In life and death struggle, something many different religions call God finds way for the willing soul to survive.  Sometimes the thing you are trying to keep from killing you is the thing you are learning from and growing in dealing with it.
B00A1C17EK|5.0|The DVD set was great!!  I have watched it several times and have been very pleased with it.  Thank you!!
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I love the songs that are sung on Songs from the Heart. Each song tells a story. I will purchase other CD's that they make!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is such a fun game. Graphics are great, and music is great. My daughter loves nemo so I downloaded it onto my kindle ans I can't stop playing it lol it so fun and I love it. Thank you!!!
B005DNPKSQ|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, but as a fan of movies that make you think about what it means to be alive, this fell short. The set-up making us believe that Truman had indeed lived his whole life as part of a movie set was well done, technically. The movie just lacked any sort of emotional follow-through, and by the climax I frankly didn't care whether Truman left or stayed.<br />I'm a fan of this sort of movie, but this one didn't have anything that a 20-minute short movie would have missed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the most fun game I have played. Most games get boring after a couple months but this game is so addictive I have been playing for about 6 months now and still can't get enough. Very disappointed when I run out of bingo credits though. Would be nice to be able to buy them with bingo dollars.
0470913029|5.0|I have seen great results with clients that have changed their way of eating to Paleo. I'm a personal trainer.

B00821OX98|4.0|Interesting and different.  Story line appears to be moving OK.  Alien who are really in control a question mark at this time.
B000NIVJGI|4.0|What can I say?  I don't like the movie and never have.  It's a chick flick.  My wife sits down and will watch it and it's got great picture quality...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|better than 100 floors<br />expect math and multiple numbers to remember and one math?  but its not too hard<br />grafics good but needs more levels
B00C1TOTK0|1.0|We ordered the Blu-ray edition of \\"Shane,\\" which I believe is the greatest western ever made.  The film is advertised to be in an aspect ratio of 1.77-1, which would have filled our 16x9 TV very nicely.  Unfortunately, the advertising, and even the information on the disc's packaging, is false.  The actual aspect ratio is 1.37-1, which in essence is the old 4x3 format for very old movies and TVs.  On top of that, the picture looks squeezed or pinched in on the right and left sides, and also looks like some of the top and bottom of the picture has been cut off.  Whoever created this disc completely blew it.<br /><br />We have advised Amazon, and sent the movie back.  Their customer service was excellent as usual, and they have agreed to refund our money.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Believable characters, good plot and a really good read.  I laughed, I cried, I'm betting there will be a movie soon.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Anyone searching for truth about Jesus, the man behind the deified Pauline version of Christianity, must read this book. One recognizes how Jesus became a reluctant Christ, an unintentional founder of a religion. I see him standing by the Vatican wondering what it is all about. Reza Aslan has created an absorbing narrative exploring complex historical material.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Really enjoyed seeing Tom Cruise again Along with the others.  He actually looks younger in this than sowm others movies.  The story almost seems it could be true or become true!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Just got this mouse and it's great! I really like the looks and features. On the fly dpi control is great. Gaming is awesome, precise control. My old mouse was a G5 Logitech, this one beats it hands down. I would recommend this mouse to any gamer, price, quality, and functionality can't be beat!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game BUT does not run on KINDLE FIRE.<br /><br />Wanted this game for grandson and was playing it on competitor and it<br />looked great so went to Kindle Apps and downloaded - then<br />found out it did not work
0812973992|3.0|McCann has some wonderful turns of phrase in this book, and is clearly a master of the English language. Based on the glowing reviews and awards, I perhaps set my expectations too high. The story is a loosely connected series of vignettes of the sleazy underbelly of New York, prostitutes and Irishmen, I suppose, being Irishmen. Oddly the story emphasizes the true story of the man who sky-walked between the twin towers, although one wonders what he has to do with the novel at all. There are extended patches of rather senseless dialogue from those who observed it as if it were the greatest event ever. Are we are really talking about blase New Yorkers? It is almost as if the author thought the event itself was worthy of a novel, but keeps the reason hidden from the reader. The author also constructs, aye, that's the proper word, quite a few convenient connections between people that are so contrived as to be a bit off-putting. Some of the characters are interesting but it really takes a John Irving to make believable connections between a tightrope-walker, a band of prostitutes, and two Irish brothers.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book to my best friend or book club? Is it dazzling, ground-breaking as claimed? Not really, but I wouldn't discourage any reading addict from having a go at it, since McCann is an excellent writer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it's. a good game.  we enjoy playing this with our 3 year old don.  the minions are adorable and it is a challenging game
B000OLGCI4|4.0|This is the best version of the Kipling story ever made, in my opinion.  Phil Harris and Louis Prima added great musical emphasis to a good story, which makes it a classic to me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the atmosphere and time of that era. They have stayed true to the period and the characters are deep.
B003D513TQ|5.0|This was a fantastic movie. I really enjoyed all the scenes and the history of their lives. Definitely see it's worth it!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have read this book twice. Once you get into it a bit it is hard to put down! God Bless the U.S. Armed Forces!!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This is an interesting and entertaining movie. There was not a lot of foul language. There was some nudity and some sexual content.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Pretty  useful. I'd be better if it was a graphing/scientific calculator. But it is still really useful. I'd recommend it
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|A challenging game that will give you hours of fun, a must buy if you like strategy games. Played this on the computer a while back and bought it as soon as I saw it on the store, the kindle version is better in my opinion.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|The mighty god of thunder!  Watch as he flexes his might Norse-god muscles in brilliant high definition!  Hear the crackle and boom the lightning and thunder as he uses Mjolnir to vanquish his foes!  Experience Natalie Portman as she.....uh....does her Natalie Portman thing...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting - mid level difficulty, good to pass time while waiting for your flight. You can move to the next level pretty quickly
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Such a beautiful movie! It makes it even better that it's based on a true story! Claire Danes is prefect.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Didn't know what too spect  by watching the previes. I am very surprise and please to say that is a great movie and that like many others had say, visually is incredible, acting is also very good. I saw this on my Fire can wait too see the movie again on a real tv on blue ray.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Stalone is a better actor than Swartzch.. this is a surprise..<br />Good action scene.<br />I would recommand it to any action fan
B005LAIIJY|4.0|The dvd was advertised as new, in shrink-wrapping. Well, the dvd was shrink-wrapped but the cardboard outer cover, not in the shrink-wrapping, was frayed and worn. So...what was the real condition of the dvd within? Dunno.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The movie portrays a comic book classic. Using the amount of time where most people would spend reading the first half of these great sagas. Not very involved were a publishing actually takes off in scrupulous detail. It replicates the genre with its humor successfully.
B005TKD6NY|5.0|Intriguing, subtle and delicate... Anything more would not do the book justice. (Except I have to write more words to complete the review)
B00CWV8X04|4.0|A A A +. It will keep you interested. The end is great, my wife and daughter enjoy it very much.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|From the time you start, you don't want to quit.  Can't wait for next one.  Time flies by as you become engrossed with the game.  You just want to see what will happened next.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was very good but it did not have the depth of emotion of its predecessors.  I felt it dragged some in last several chapters.
B002N2LEVM|4.0|I am plagued by loving shows that have been cancelled. It seems to me that I'm unable to find these until their off the air, and it saddens me that this show had gone by the wayside. They did a good job of wrapping it up, but I wanted so much more. Worth watching, and re watching in any case, quite addictive.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have always loved playing bingo.  Now I can play when i want and get a chance to play with my mom too.  It's our thing.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Like it and its a great application!!!! It's helpful because I walk my daughter's to school in the mornings. Weather is always crazy here need daily updates.
B0046B4VXQ|2.0|'Carrie' was my first exposure to Stephen King, DVD or otherwise. It will also be my last. The first part of the movie was boring; it was also unpleasant to watch Carrie's mother abuse her and classmates make fun or her. Then comes the famous ending - totally unrealistic, fantasyland.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It takes a long time to earn a complete set but it's tons of fun trying. Since you get free games every day you can save up for a bingo blitz!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I do not like the way it sets up my home page. It does not show the way that I see it on my computer. I like that why. I cannot get to my games that I play on Facebook . I downloaded the new way yesterday and I really don't like it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|folks  i  cant  say  enough  about  this  movie,  its  all  about  great  old  time  music  mixed  with  great  comedy  with  george  clooney,  tim  blake,  john  goodman  i  have  watched  it  more  than  ten  times  one  of  those  movies  you  can  watch  over  an  over  if  your  an  old  time  music  fan  you  can,t  help  but  like  it
B009AY04A8|4.0|Great graphics, user friendly, entertaining.  A little more dialog than I would wish, but overall a nice way to waste time!
B000A7DVR2|2.0|jeff  bridges  has  done  many  great  movies,  but  this  one  was  a  dubb,  too  much  cussing  for  me,  lots  of  one  liners  for  a  comedey,  but  wasn,t  funny,  thats  my  personal  oppinion  but  i  love  great  comedy  but  no  laughs  in  this  one  the  movie  is  over  rated
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It is a very nice version of an amazin arcade. Aditinal capacity to improve weapons is great could be adictive...
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboard application, use it on many different phones, works flawlessly. Greatly recommend it. Love how it predicts what I want say, helps avoid many typos.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game it easy relaxing very pretty colors it's not all boyish like I would had thought. My love helping me play the game also. We love breading the dragons to see what pretty colors we can com up with.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Like it better than my Roku for Netflix. Expect other apps like HBO GO to be added soon. Like its simplicity.
B004ADH1RI|3.0|I have heard references to this movie a lot. However, it was one of those generational things I missed. Despite the age, 1-dimensional characters, and so on, it was fun to watch and explained what some of those Goony quotes were about.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|Being a big fan of the original Iron Man and Robert Downey, Jr., have to say I was pretty disappointed with this sequel.<br /><br />This movie lacks originality, solid plot, and character development.  If this was the first movie of the 3 Iron Man's, it would have also been THE LAST.  Let me emphasize:<br /><br />Here we have a superhero with astonishing mental and emotional characteristics, which was actually established in the first movie (thanks to Robert's excellent acting). What sets IronMan apart from other superheros is his mortality; without his suit, Tony Stark is just a blood and flesh human being, that is capable of dying of cancer or developing alcohol addiction (as seen in Iron Man 2).  In this movie, Tony Stark displays PTSD, which really added to the character's depth, yet did not seem to fit within the general tone of the movie. Robert's acting was mediocre at best and really seemed out of place with the Disney World tone of this movie.<br /><br />What a cliché...(Spoiler alert)<br />Tony Stark decides to give up all his incredible abilities and care for society for some bimbo named Pepper. What a bad bad ending... How many times have we seen a Super hero give up his powers (Ex. Superman 2) to live a domestic boring life with some aging woman?  Towards the end of the movie, Tony decides to blow up something like 100 Iron Man Suits, to start a \\"New Slate\\".  Oh PLEASE, \\"let me create 100 ten billion dollars suits, so I can blow them up in a 'beautiful' firework display to impress my boring girlfriend.\\"  One of many major stinker scenes in this movie.<br /><br />The Villains:<br />Ok, this is the most ridiculous villains I've ever seen.  You have normal people turned into fire breathing red devils, by some magical serum.  Dumb, dumb, dumb..  Is that the best the writers could come up with? What is amusingly idiotic, is that if the bad guys get \\"too hot\\" they explode like mini atomic bombs. (Spoiler alert) Having the Mandarin turn out to be a Ex-homeless British theater actor was actually kind of humorous, but may not sit well with many avid fans of marvel comic movies.<br /><br />If this movie had left out the cliche ending, dumb villains, bad acting, annoying characters, and Tony's lard butt bodyguard it may have been a decent.. oh wait, that pretty much is everything. (smirk)<br /><br />On the positive side, this movie had a couple of entertaining action scenes, but hardly made up for the rest of this Iron Man tragedy.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I started reading this book with very little knowledge of u.s prison. I knew it was tough, sure- but Kerman really gave doing time dimension, with a fresh and intriguing emotional spin on her story that took a closer look at human nature itself, as well as the prisoner's. while written in clear, easy to read terms, this book is far from simplistic, highlighting both the hardships and triumphs of prison life and bonds between women.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|I think this is something everyone can watch and enjoy. This is definitely something whole families can enjoy together or on their own.
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a great way to share the best of the best in so many different areas. I can see the latest fashions or the best recipes, beautiful places to visit, funny pet pictures. I love it!!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I loved what I saw of it.  It is a very funny movie, and easy to use in my Kindle Fire.  However my mother had to go to the hospital and I missed the last hour because of time expiring.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This film was the first Miyazaki film that I ever watched, and it still remains one of my favorites. Though it is a cartoon I would only recommend it for mature children. There are some scary scenes that may frighten the unsuspecting viewer. Aside from very young viewers, this is a beautiful film with fabulous artwork that is really a must see.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Start to finish this book kept my absolute attention. The characters are well developed and amazing! I could read this again and again.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey is incredibly gifted with humor.  Her book is written more for women's lives but it was still very funny for anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm very glad to to have ordered it on the second day it was released. Amazon.com shipped it quick with netflix free code.<br /><br />Now wife watches netflix and my little boy watches YouTube through it every day. They are more than happy. I just ordered the second one from Bestbuy to prevent conflict from them.<br /><br />The build quality is good and picture quality is excellent. Smooth and fluid hd content without lag.<br /><br />Highly recommended if anyone would like to upgrade your existing tvs into smart tvs with minimum cost.<br /><br />Only con from Google is the latest firmware blocks the possibility to stream other media than those approved sources.
0307476073|2.0|Felt book was too fictionalized.<br />A lot of happening unbelievable. Must have been made up<br />For up coming movie.<br />Did not motivate me walk the Pacific coast trail.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love puzzle  games like this; the more complicated and intricate  the  better. Playing on a touch tablet gave it a great feeling of real life interaction as if I was actually in The Room exploring these  strange objects. The game I perfectly creepy to give it that intense edge without being too over the top, just right amount of subtle scary for me. The small story left in the notes was so intriguing - it or left&nbsp;me wanting more. My one complaint is that it ended too soon. I burned through it in two days but that's probably my fault. ;P I could have stayed in The Room forever. Can't wait for the next installment!!!!!
B007QXWV1U|2.0|I like the app but there have been no updates.  I know the developers have updated it in other markets.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|it was just the kind of show I enjoy watching. I enjoyed each of the actors and the era it was representing.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Nothing like a good remake to remember the old  classics. Good job, worth getting. If u liked the classic ull like this.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Amazing series, old but still one of the best imanginative syfi series, every fan should become a can and blow wind.
0525953728|5.0|I must admit I have never been a big novel reader, apparently because I hadn't found my genre until now. This book caught my interest and I couldn't put it down till i was done reading it! Well maybe that exaggerated a little, but I finished the whole book in three days. That's reading it in my downtime (currently deployed). This book had done what the author stated was his goal and after reading I want to become a seal lol. His statements will resonate with any servicemember that has ever been deployed to the places he talks about. The book takes you on a journey that I could visualize. Easily 5 stars and if i could rate higher I would. If you want to know the life of a elite soldier, or what really happened that night UBL was killed this is a must read. I definitely recommend to others who like military related novels even if you aren't an avid reader like I WAS..... Pick up this book.
B0083GDLL8|5.0|David Bowie has always been hit or miss for me - he's either too far out there or just hits the spot.  This means that most of his albums, in my opinion, have some awesome songs and some awful ones.  Not so with &#34;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&#34;.<br /><br />The style remains consistent throughout the album without straying into the monotony of most modern music.  It also seems to tell an actual story, albeit in a piecemeal way, which I, personally, find fascinating.<br /><br />Overall:  Any Bowie or 70's rock fans should definitely try this out.  If you're hesitant, listen to a few of the songs on YouTube.  Easy to listen to while having deep content at the same time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun and realistic. you don't just have one horse you can have as many as you want, a great way to pass time!
B008J34466|5.0|Love her!  She manages to blow me away with every new CD and song.  P!nk rocks - that is all.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good old fashion missile command but a little easier.  Still addicting though. Only one base fires so it's easy to play as well.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|Fun, fantasy, action, adventure, love story and a message of hope that there is life after the trailer park and saving the universe is a really big deal.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I am a big fan of both Marvel and DC superheroes and the Incredible Hulk in particular. Apart from the decent video and audio qualities experienced on the Amazon Instant Video Service, the movie itself surpassed my expectations. Even with the advancement in movie technology nowadays, I was still thrilled by the special effects and action sequences in this movie. The characters were impeccably portrayed by the various actors. Well, Robert Downy Jr's performance was anticipated but Mark<br />Ruffalo's delivery as a composed Bruce Banner, in my opinion, put the icing on the cake!
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|This game test the mind on a high level and was easy to download. I like the the graphic and the sound
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|love this game hungry shark  evolution  is so much funny  i recommend  it to everyone. please leave your reviews after playing it.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|If you don't think this movie deserved 5 stars, I don't understand you as a human being.  I grew up watching the original series, and I am thrilled with what JJ Abrams is doing with this movies.  Love it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I really love playing this game but just found out that there going  to make a second version of this game that we will probably have to buy again. Not sure if it's really worth it anymore. But it definitely is an awesome game.
B00AEBBA0Y|5.0|Good guys win bad guys die, lots of explosions and bullets flying, pretty girl who is not a bimbo - what more is needed to have a good time?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm not a big gamer so parts of this game are difficult. But I love the minions and the challenge!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is, by far, the best series I have ever watched!  It is so addictive!  The storyline and actors are beyond excellent!  I cannot say enough good things about this production.  I can hardly wait for Season 4.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of my favorite shows. It's chock full of characters that'll burrow themselves in the heart of viewers. This season was one of the best they've had. It made me laugh and it made me cry...like a baby.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is gr8! It lets me do account grades on instagram! I could never do them b4 I got this app! Totally worth every star.
B002U041VW|5.0|Best Album.  Love the Horns and Drums and the island vibes.Love Jason Mraz' quirky style and lyrics.also love the live performance on DVD
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman always has a way with words. All his books keep me up at night reading and this one was no exception. A wonderful story blurring lines of reality and fiction in a beautiful way. Somewhat reminds me of the basic concept of Neverwhere, which is a favorite.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I liked it. curious to see if the movies match the books.  It did take a few twists and unexpected turns
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really great game to be playing. Anyone who likes and or loves despicable me should play this game.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My kids played this app for ever every day they love it. Why don't the make a lot of apps like this!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Pretty neat little game. At the first you have, what feels like, tons of money and the action is a bit slow. Then it gets faster and the money comes slow. Not too bad for being free. Id recommend this to those that want a semi space invader game.
B00650SSWG|2.0|It's entertainment but not the greatest form. It is a cliche chick flick with two overrated people in the roles. The chemistry is awkward at best and it is so easy to guess what will happen next.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|The order came on-time, but when I opened the package the CD glass case was cracked. I played through the CD and nothing was wrong with it. A bit of a bummer the case cracked but it had good music.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This app is amazing!!!!!!!! It works like a charm, I recommend this app for anyone!!!! You will be amazed at the difference and you can definitely tell there is one!!!!!
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|I ordered 9 bulbs. Within a few months, 2 failed. Then over approximately one year, 4 failed. Contacted their customer service, since they claim they have a 2 year warranty. Provided them with my ordering information from Amazon. They refused replacing them, claiming that I needed to save the original boxes with SKU numbers. The bulbs I received had no identifying information on them. Poor product. Poor service. Don't waste your time nor money.
0770437400|4.0|I read the book after seeing the movie.  I am still wondering how they got the film from this.  I enjoyed it but it has little to do with the movie other than the title.
B00640UICA|5.0|If you need something to do for a while and like puzzle games its wonderful.<br /><br />I would tell anyone to get this and it is very inexpensive.
B009LDD54K|5.0|I'm watching the third series now and really enjoying it. There are so many twists and turns, its keeps me wanting to see more.  HBO has outdone themselves.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Nice sharp graphics, various types of hidden object tasks (by shape, list, and things like &quot;find all the bottles.&quot;) You can turn the timer off if you like. The story is pretty cheesy, but I'm having fun with it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love looking at all the different ideas we are buying a house I just wish we had more money so I could use all the ideas lol
B000I5X81A|3.0|These are wonderfully subtle JJ tracks (with some Clapton imitations of JJ thrown in), and while his and Eric's vocals mix well at times,  Eric dumbs down the whole thing. Why?<br /><br />Eric's guitar is just about everything JJ's is not: Clapton is heavy handed, leaden, and even brusque on songs that ask for the art of touch. Unfortunately, this is something Eric's countless incarnations have left him without -- he now exhibits little sensibility, zero authenticity, and next to no deftness in working on detail. No wonder he admires JJ as much.  Then there's the dubbing of vocals -- put Eric's rock singing over JJ's wry intonations and laid back approach (especially on the choruses) and you get mashed potatoes.  Bye bye nuance. Eric plonks down the voice like a construction worker laying down bricks.  It's plain frustration.  And by the way, I was a Clapton fan at some point.<br /><br />How good these JJ songs were to begin with, we'll never know.<br /><br />JJ is now gone and here is JJ album spoiled by one of MOR's most known visitors. A shame.<br /><br />(On a brighter note, I have the sneaking suspicion JJ saved his better material for his last 2 albums, which are thankfully Clapton-less, and they are nothing but brilliant.)
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I loved \\"Upstairs, Downstairs back in the day, and could not believe that anything would be able to top the series. Then along came Downton Abbey and it was love at first watch!  The costuming, characters, and storylines are very engaging and the casting is superb. This season has some real melodramatic moments and tearjerking scenes; just when you think you've figured out the raison d'etre for each character another facet comes into focus. The series is an Anglophile's dream!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Great look and was simple and easy to set up and use.  I like the blue background and can be either digital or old school.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Exactly what I need for the way I use a calculator. What a wonderful free app, I prefer this app to the other free calculator. Recommend
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it!  A real challenge to keep my brain alert.  Great fun.  Can not put it down...very exciting. Only negative is that a hint would be nice.<br /><br />.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Love this song! Have it on my HAPPY playlist. Definitely puts you in good spirits, whether you're in the shower, exercising, cooking
B001NHNG64|5.0|Easy read.  Love that the good guys win.  But they have to work for it.  Would recommend for those who cheer for the underdog.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I am not so surprised that i loved this book, but more surprised that the same author wrote &#34;Gone Girl&#34;.  Very unique premise with stop-start emotional attachments to the characters.<br />Definitely a workout reading this book!  Loved it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Exciting. Intense. Beautiful. Fun. Scary. Exilerating. Amazing. Intriguing. Splendid. Surprising. Nail biting. Shocking. Great. Superb. Guns. Swords. Zombis. Buy it!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Game is kind of fun and addicting.  It will keep you going and going as the missiles speed up and make hand eye coordination work.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Works really great on my Motorola zoom. Its a fun game to play. Simple graphics. Easy goal. Just good ole' fashioned fun.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock is probably by far the best I've seen yet. Other than being affordable, my favorite part about this app is that you can set the alarm to be able to wake up to your favorite music or recordings that you have saved on your Kindle,(Fire that is). That is why I give this app five out of five stars.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|LOVE THE GAME! LOADS OF FUN TO PLAY AND SOLVE THE PUZZLES! I'M A HUGE FAN OF HIDDEN OBJECT GAMES AND THIS ONE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITES!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great start and finish----was very gripping---<br />the best of the whole series.<br />I should have stopped with it because the story got weaker and weaker.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app. It is well designed, easy to use. I like the voice reminder when the battery gets low.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|This movie is slow and boring.  I could only stand to watch 20 minutes of it before calling it quits
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I thought this game would be stupid but then I started to play it and I enjoyed it very much. It's a fun game if you enjoy games like bike race and nascar. I would give it a very high rating bc of its graphics,entertainment,and just the overall game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Every facet of this well written drama is a privelage to watch. I can't wait for the fourth season to begin!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|For this to be a free game it is a awesome one. For anyone who love the movies,and let's be honest who didn't?,this is a treat.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|I love this movie and with Prime I could see it. Thank you because it is not listed on the other pay for networks or free ones either
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|This is a wonderful movie! Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job of being Jay Gatsby, second only to Robert Redford in the original.<br />You should really see this movie.
0812983459|3.0|Great beginning and middle.  I had so much hope for the traveler, those he'd left behind and the one he was seeking.  Sadly all he'd learned on his walk was forgotten before he arrived.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun to beat them in cats and dogs are not be tough for this entry trackback from your computer and video games are not the same.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read The Five People You Meet In Heaven and enjoyed it as well as the movie so I decided to try another of Alboms' novels and was very pleased with this one. Dor ends up with insights into the meaning of life as well as the other characters you meet. In many ways I saw myself in these characters and will think twice about wishing \\"time to fly.\\"
B0095P31L6|4.0|My children 10,9,and 8 love to watch this movie on my Kindle.  My kids really liked this movie and will watch it over and over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is great, it is great for kids to learn all about horses and how to care for them.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|Great show. Very entertaining and scary at the same time. Can't wait for next season! Love the actors on the show as well.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Game is cool and fun and addictive like subway subway surfers it has a lot of minion s to unlock very nice game
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book was exciting from start to finish. Heartbreaking and uplifting all at once, I couldn't put it down. Definitely worth the read!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|The Blu-Ray arrived in mint condition, with the frills and freebies to boot.<br /><br />Do otherwise catch the film on home video for the solid performances of it's cast and the director's hold over a subject matter that could have easily been overdramatized into cheese.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am a fan of Preston & Child's books, especially the Pendergast series.  This book keeps the story going and gives great suspense and excitement.  As always, I excitedly await the next book in the series.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|It's not my first encounter with Victor Cheng - the strategic planning consultant. There are two things I like about this guy:<br />- He has an 'un-puffy' attitude - he speaks (and writes) in a very down to earth-friendly way, as if he only reminds you of something you've known long ago.<br />- His knowledge is supported with hands on experience (as apposed to be an academic scholar) so you feel you are being though by a field expert.<br /><br />Both of these qualities can be found in this book.<br />I've finished working at Deloitte & Touch over a decade ago but I still remember my interview... I wasn't familiar with Cheng's work then and, although I eventually got the job, I think reading this book would have helped me a lot, at least by lowering my anxiety level.<br /><br />This book offers a structured analysis of a case interview - from different assessments tools through variety of interview contexts to the different kinds of interviews.<br />All subjects are dotted with examples which both clarify the ideas and supply the reader with 'mass' that enables field implantation.<br /><br />The only drawback I've found in this book is that it's a little bit too technical in the sense that it speaks about what one should 'do' and not enough about what should one 'be'. Winning a job is not just about how you act during the interview, it's also about what qualities you bring with you. One of these qualities is 'confrontational ability' - the ability to confront and contain a difficult situation - in the context of Cheng's book the interview - in order to deliver oneself better.<br />A good discussion on confrontational ability I've found in the book<br />[[ASIN:B00E1O5MJ0 Leadership & Management series: The Matrix Of Conflict - Understanding why we get trapped in confrontational situations and adopting a unique & new approach to winning]]<br /><br />As my title says, Cheng offers an instructive guide that will surly help you better prepare and increase your chances towin the job you're interviewing for.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game, needs a few features. In particular an option to kill sounds right after you launch the game and before it makes any noise.
B002BVXYRC|5.0|The extra material is fabulous adn the packaging is very nice. The quality of the DVD material could be better, both video and audio wise, but other than that, is a must buy if you don't have amnesiac and you love radiohead.
B00DHKKN6Q|1.0|Could not download. Kindle virus protection warning &#34;malware virus&#34;. Not sure how to rate this. Just could not download it.
B00001QEE7|5.0|I can't believe my daughter(14 years old) never saw this movie. I know it is one of the Disney movies we do not own,I just had to find one and buy it.This and another item was my first my first purchase from amazon. I purchased it used and it was in pretty good shape. And my daughter enjoyed watching it. Kinda of glad there is still a&#34; Disney Princess&#34; deep down in my 14 year old. She'll never admit to it though. =)
B000SEFM6K|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Marian Halcombe is a intelligent, resourceful character and her part of the book  and how it concluded was my favourite part.  A poor, unattractive woman who has the odds stacked against her in what is a man's world and yet she still battles on. She is a compellingly charismatic character and you continue to root for her. I loved her battle of wits with Count Fosco. Two charismatic characters who dominate this book.Yes, it is a long read but it is well worth it.
B008RLTUUA|4.0|As a retired physician this clear expose rings bells. I knew that the drug companies were in business to sell their drugs. I knew it well enough not to allow detail persons in to my office most of the time. I was still accosted by these charming people in the hospital and elsewhere. I truly had no idea of the extent of their influence nor the effectiveness of their methods. This book does a thoughtful job of portraying their methods. At times a bit too much repetitive detail but for the most part I can only say well done.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My 14 year old and I loved this game! We actually did something on the kindle together! Finally a game to sharpen the mind!
B0089EHWQE|1.0|It's a sad world that we live in when we place less value on some lives & go along with the taking of it!!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I am a new reader of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books and I could not put it down.<br /><br />Cannot wait to order another.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I don't know why this is so addictive, but I can't stop playing it! The free version  I had would hang up and not let me play, so I had to spring for the premium version to get it to work. This one is fine.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Great movie to watch with the whole family!  We all enjoyed it very much.  I'm not sure why they went CGI on this one though.  Most of the voice actors probably could have pulled off the roles in a live action film.
1452110581|3.0|The title poem may be the best one in the book, and the lure to make you purchase it. It's a cute and fun little book, but once thru and you're done with it, Then it's time to give it away.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|What is beyond Bridalveil Fall? It is the stuff of legends. Oria is a member of the Ahwahneechee tribe.

B005KR6OBM|4.0|gotta have these if you're a fan. Some of my discs hang up and that drove me crazy, but it was too much bother to do anything about it (returning them to a sender I didn't remember by the time I watched the dvd's).
B005XQLBU4|4.0|the old made new.  tons of fun ....even daughter loves it too....we play together..good times good times...always.  highly recomended...I don't know what else to say I wanted to say I like it and its fun...but the 20 min isn't letting me post
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun if not a bit repetitive.  The kids like it and it keeps them occupied so that's what counts. Would be nice if there was a bit more variety to the enemies.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Worked like a charm right out of the box. Super product and great value. Easy installation for the non-technical like me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wow this game is so fun I cant beloved that this is a game and I like that there's so much more games
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie, nice action scenes, just the right amount of action/explosions that make it look interesting and believable, nice performances from the actors, if you love movies and  if you are a fan of 007 then you have to see it.
B002X6PTH8|4.0|Just rented this movie recently, but the family enjoyed it very much.  We could not find this movie on netflix, so we were excited to see it on Amazon.  The quality was good.
1400052173|5.0|One of the most interesting and well written books that I have every read.<br />An amazing true medical story. Rebecca Skloot is a wonderful write. This is a book<br />that once you start to read it you cannot put it down until you finish it.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|Our family loved this movie.  I was not sure if anything could compare to The Wizard of Oz, but this is very well written and helps to explain how the Wizard came to be.  The movie is extremely colorful and creative.  I especially liked how Oz the Great and Powerful begins with black and white like the Wizard of Oz.  Pleasantly surprised!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Great CD (if you're a Phil Collins fan).  This CD was priced right, and arrived quickly too.  Going to play this CD in my classroom.  I know it'll have a &#34;calming&#34; effect on my students.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Paradise Valley continues John Mayer's journey into manhood.<br />Fans who want him to stay suspended forever in his Continuum<br />days, just don't understand how a musician grows. John<br />Mayer had real musical guts, IMO, by following his heart and his<br />own vision on this CD.<br /><br />As a man in his mid-60's who has heard and seen<br />just about everyone worth seeing in concert, I urge you to<br />go to a John Mayer concert to understand what a genius and<br />passionate performer this young man is. I saw him again recently,<br />and he paid homage to his whole musical history. It was incredible.<br /><br />Some fans are saying \\"this is country\\" regarding Paradise Valley.<br />Hmmm...have they really listened to the album...more than once?<br />Waitin' On The Day and Who You Love are beautiful songs.<br /><br />Listen carefully. This guy has got it all.<br /><br />For me, John Mayer is the standout in today's young generation music scene.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|Some may like this movie, that's fine.  They may also like Tron and other movies that lose me and have little to no acting talent or story.  Maybe my mind is too simple and doesn't click with all the symbolism.  Whatever.  This movie felt more like a waste of my time, my money, and the studio's money every minute that went by.  The point of the story?  The story?!  Overacted.  Over spent.<br /><br />If you prefer movies which typically have lower budgets, rely on acting and the story itself, you may want to skip this one.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|This was great, thanks. loved the movie. five star rating.....I've filled this out before. thanks anyway. got to go now.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is for all ages. The coloring and design of the tiles are pleasing to the eye. I recommend all 247 games.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Limited in capabilities, however it is so easy for what it does, it is well worth it.  I would purchase another in a heartbeat.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Being a working actor, this is a nice break from the rigors and realities of performance.  Well done!<br />Enjoyed myself
B00CM03H4C|5.0|I thought the soundtrack for TGG was truly exceptional. Watching the movie and hearing the music gave me chills, and the modernization of the soundtrack twisted the movie in a good way. In particular, Lana Del Ray's Young and Beautiful is one of my favorites of the album and literally gave me goosebumps when I heard it. Definitely worth $8.
0375869026|5.0|Palacio (or whatever the author's real name is) can write.  I thought that the characters in this book seemed realistic, and thoroughly enjoyed getting to know them.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Excellent!  True to book!  I am looking forward to watching it again!  Mature content.  Best for adults and mature teens.
125000098X|5.0|I don't think he can write a bad book, and the most recent series keeps me waiting anxiously for the next adventure in the Clifton family.
B000063V8R|3.0|Content was great, Was surprised by the flawed disks right out of the box. Cleaned my player and things improved.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very fun addictive game..... good one to have when you are sitting and waiting somewhere. Easy to pickup hard to put down!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I didn't buy this case on amazon, I bought it on the lifeproof site but i love it so much! i use it all the time in the water and snow so it works very well. I have had it for about 7-8 months now and it still works! I haven't had any problems yet. Some of my friends have had to buy new ones though, because it had leaked, but not me! The only thing that bugs me is the headphone jack plug; it is so small and easy to lose, but I guess you can always order a new one. Other than that, its a great buy!
B004DEW9L2|5.0|This is one of the key examples of the French New Wave. Godard's intentions were to break all the rules of cinema. He shot this with a handheld camera, he parodies noir films, he showed pornography, he referenced numerous other artists as easter eggs to create an entrance into the mind of the director. While maybe not sublime, this film is wonderfully entertaining, and for what it's intentions were it is a masterpiece, too well thought out and executed. I enjoy it not simply for it's novelty and place in cinematic history but because of the unique expression Godard gives to his aesthetic despite it having such bold intentions
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love Mahjong Kindle version! It is a good game that is challenging and keeps you entertained for a long time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game bring back lots of memories. I love it.  I can play this game for hours this is a love of his old game from playing it when I was a kid
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So cool to be able to view youtube on the tv with such ease. Hopefully more content becomes available to stream via the Chromecast, but for now at $35, its worth it just for youtbue (and netflix and google play).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is both Challenging and fun.I really Enjoyed trying to figure it out. Pleas make more levels.<br />The best part is that it was free!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Action Packed! Suspenseful! If you're a Star Trek fan this is a must see! Great chemistry between actors! Kirk & Spock perfect for the role!  Can't wait to see the next movie...
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This puzzle based game is challenging, but what makes it fun is how rewarding it is. After a puzzle is finished, your treated with the option to play with the animals, it really makes learning fun for the kids. The level of difficulty is perfect and the illustrations bright and charming.  I'm glad I went with this after the free version!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I learned things about wheat that I never would have questioned before.  To think that wheat has become so genetically altered that it really has no resemblance to the wheat of 60 years ago is appalling.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is  a simple, yet really fun game. Everything in the app works correctly on my s3, and it is very addicting.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Who in their right mind creates an app that has targets that are EXTREMELY hard to hit, and then you only get 35 middles when there are at least forty targets. This app may be $0.99, but that does not automatically say it is a good app. THIS APP SUCKS!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is by far the best version of this app. I bought another app that was along the same line and dumped it after a few uses. This app works great on kindle fire and I recommend it.
0316227706|5.0|My wife and I are big dog lovers and we love this book! The pictures are just so much fun to look at, and we've flipped through them many times. The book sits on our coffee table, and anybody else that has every looked through it has enjoyed it, too.<br /><br />The only negative I would site (and I mention this with some reservation as it may have been our fault due to improper care), is that the hardcover has bowed outwards and the pages are now wavy. I don't recall ever having the book near water or lots of moisture, but it is possible, and it's just a bummer since it's a book we like so much.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great.  Set-up was easy, connection was easy.  Playing movies and tv shows was easy.  Just waiting for expanded available content.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Very happy - comfortable - great sound - very good range - good battery life - charges quickly - compatible with windows 8 - no issues (yet)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The plot and characters on this series make it worth watching each and every week! I can't wait until season 4!
B00APJLEGA|3.0|Hotel Transylvania is a very DECENT family film, obviously geared toward a younger child audience with some mild attempts to amuse the parents.  You won't want to gouge your eyes out watching it, but it's hardly memorable either.<br /><br />The acting is good, and the movie starts out well as they introduce the various monsters and play up their unique characteristics and mythology well for laughs, such as Frankenstein's* pyrophobic fear of fire, and Griffin AKA The Invisible Man pulling pranks.  Unfortunately, the movie is quickly mired down by a rebellious teenage love story that's too uninteresting for the kids and too cliché for the teen/adult crowd.<br /><br />In all, the whole thing is predictable and overly...okay.  It's not terrible, but not great.  A definite Could See if the kids want to watch something new.<br /><br />*Actually Frankenstein's monster.  Frankenstein BUILT the monster commonly referred to as Frankenstein.  The filmmakers probably glossed over this point so as not to confuse the kids...and missed an opportunity to make a running gag of people calling him by his &#34;dad's&#34; name.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE MINIONS SO MUCH I HAVE A MINION ROOM AND I HAVE MINION EVERY THING!!!!!!!! I love the MINIONS SO much!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy set up. Can't wait for more features and apps to come on board. This Device is made well, and has a great UI.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is free and we all need to have the weather information at our finger tips!<br />This is a great addition to my favorites screen.
1451626096|3.0|I love this author as I love English history.  I didn't care for this book as much as I have enjoyed her recent previous novels.
B003XRELEI|5.0|Strange and more than a little twisted... but extremely entertaining. Vonnegut was always excellent at using strange surreal humour to make social commentary and this is no exception.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Except for the waiting between key regeneration and upgrades, a fast paced fun crawler.<br />Of course, you can pay RL money to speed things up.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|A short... but very intellectually dense... thesis on the neuroscience of what people call &#34;free will&#34;. A worthwhile quick read for anyone interested in a blend of science and philosophy.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  A quick read about how we can be more creative and productive. Yes are best ideas are stolen, but to do it right we each steal in our own way.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|Really enjoyed it. Great book of the near future William Gibson meets Neal Stephenson. Goes and does not stop. Enjoy
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Downloaded it on kindle fire, but deleted it soon after due to how massive the file is...<br /><br />Still, looks like a pretty cool game.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|doesn't add right and loses rewards after you finally earn them. fun but too many glitches<br />need to solve these problems
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Nothing special... Just does the job it needs to do in order for me to use facebook on my kindle fire.
B009AY04A8|1.0|Never even got to play. The pirate appears in the first scene, immediately starts flickering and doesn't stop. Had to dump. Multiple times.<br /><br />YER OUTTA HERE!<br /><br />I am now giving ratings based on actual experience, which was less than zero, but since I have to give it something (Amazon, are you listening?) it gets a 1.
B001EN71CW|4.0|I never get tired of watching and enjoying these shows: the characters, the plots, the environment, and the culture are stellar, unique and a fun getaway from the humdrum.  Joss Whedon, cast, and crew are spectacular in their synergy and spirit.  The reason it is not marked with five stars is because I would have wished the collection to be both blu-ray and regular.
B00532A8JI|5.0|If you like solid, intelligent progressive metal, this is a major HIT!  Fans of Opeth, System of a Down, Judas Priest, Dio, Animals as Leaders, Mastadon, Iron Maiden, etc. will full on appreciate this album!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I really enjoy the Serenity and Firefly movie and shows.  I am pleased to be able to play Serenity in my blue-ray player in the family room or the regular version in another room.  I can't afford to replace all my video cassettes and regular DVDs and will always have the older version players as well as the new ones.  I appreciate the publisher making it possible to be flexible.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|I'm throwing in my two cents to boost the ratings, which this deserves. I usually can't be bothered writing reviews. If you've ever had a horrible boss and wished they'd die, you'll enjoy this. The three would-be murderers are an act in and of themselves, perfectly in sync with each other; don't cough or blink or you could miss something.<br /><br />It's a comedy, and in my opinion, not to be over-analyzed. It does its job; it distracted me and made me laugh for a few hours, sometimes out loud. I'm glad I rented it.<br /><br />I get a kick out of reading some of these reviews; so many peeps take themselves and their own opinions way too seriously. Either you liked the movie or you didn't. If you didn't, then don't watch it again. If you did, then recommend it.<br /><br />I recommend this movie.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|This is an awesome book. If you like the Chili Peppers it is a must-read. You follow Keidis through his entire life and he never has a dull moment. There are insights into songs, wild teen moments, and everything else you would expect from a Rock-Doc book. It also gives you an in-depth look into the life of a former addict, going through the addiction and leading you out into a clean life. The best music book I have read so far.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|If you like puzzles and can add single-digit numbers, you'll enjoy this game. It offers different levels of difficulty, and gives you more points for more efficient (fast, with fewer corrections) solutions. Well worth 99&cent;.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|you cant even keep your upgrades that you get but you still lose your money. if you got to keep your upgrades it would be great. it is a waste of time and money.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Fun, witty, lots of cool action scenes, and an all-star cast. What's not to like? Possibly Bruce Willis's best movie.
B00CU9LHY2|4.0|Love this box set but a lot of the extras were already (it seems) on the mcis reissue. Plus the concert without Jimmy was a bit strange.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|A fun and exciting game. The multiplayer function is a refreshing addition to the original. I can't put it down!
0451196716|5.0|My husband is an avid Stephen King fan and I bought this to add to his collection. He really like it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It will be the best game you will ever play better than that stupid angry birds alright it is better then any game you will get on the kindle I am already a great white it is awesome get it now I demand you to click download it is awesome really
1781162646|5.0|My husband is an avid Stephen King fan and I bought this to add to his collection. He really liked it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Only rating this so that I can get that pop up off my screen. Otherwise, its an ok game. Twenty
B00D3LA71K|5.0|I like the story, it was better than expected. Also, basically anything with Matthew McConaughey in it is ok in my book.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|The distinguished characters and relationships made for an amazing read. Definitely reading the next few books in the series, for sure!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Works well keeps the CPU cool! I only use Article Silver 5 thermal paste. This works very well for me!
B0094LUH4A|5.0|I love both actors and their work was great. This is bitter sweat story with laughter and tears. Very romantic and not has real context as well - not your traditional &#34;happy end&#34;
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Initially it didn't work well with iPhone, couldn't tell if was the iPhone app or Netflix. My iPhone wouldn't discover Chromecast after I used another TV that has Wi-Fi and Netflix. Additionally, I would watch Netflix on my iPhone but when I tried to cast I would get a message on the TV that there was an error and the movie couldn't be displayed. Everything seemed to clear up after the SW update and a chromecast reset.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the cutest game ever! I love them! This is now my new favorite game. Thank u creators. Love,<br />  Minion lover245
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Fun game, but very repetative.  I wish there were a button to go to the next level without having to go through the upgrade screen.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Not the perfect clock app but very close and worth the $0.99 one must spend on it. I can't really hear any sound from it but it isn't the apps fault. Overall a very nice clock.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|A heart warming accounting of the everyday life of a young country Veterinarian in Scotland/England.  They don't just treat puppies, kittens, etc......  How about horses, cows, goats and the likes.  Very interesting.
B008GATNNG|5.0|I listen to this on my long ride to work to stay positive.  It's a great way to stay on track after reading the book.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Not quite the first one, but loved the idea of Kahn and good action. Can't wait for the next one
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome I wish I can play online that would be cool.<br />I want the update right now I want endermen sorry for spelling
1416596585|4.0|Not only a historical look inside the minds of Google. but also a good insight into there methodology and reasoning.  Businesses and webmasters or anyone who uses Google for Business purposes would benefit from the insights this book reveals.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting. I couldn't stop playing! Would definitely recommend this game. Was looking for a fun game and i found it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love despicable me because the minions are funny and silly. It also is exciting, extraordinary and stupendous that's why I adore minion rush.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This is such a fun game! I Love that you can personalize your monkey. The game has great graphics. would definitely recommend
B00004YRQA|5.0|Gift for my son and he was really happy. Thank for the product and at a great price! Thank You!
B002RI9S2Y|4.0|The film adaptation of the second book, Percy Jackson and the Sea of Monsters is currently running in the theaters. I saw the first movie a while back and quite liked it. However since the original books are about a twelve-year-old boy, I was not so keen on reading them. I mean how could a children's book possibly capture the attention of a grown-up woman? Wouldn't it be too simple for me?? So when I saw it standing on a shelf in the library I thought: Yeah so not the book for me and walked past it. Oh why not, there are gods and other mythical creatures featured in this book. And took it with me. I'm sooooo glad I did it! You don't notice at all that the book is about a young boy and his friends. That its intended audience are middle graders. This book proves once again that books can be read by everyone ^^<br /><br />It also proves that books are usually better than their movie adaptations. They left so many fun and important things out! The \\"real\\" story was also much and much better. It's way more fascinating, funny and intriguing. You get to see more of the wonderous world of the gods. The movie even left out some amazing and great moments that I would have loved seeing on-screen. This makes me a bit curious to how this will influence the second movie, cause some events were quite important ^^<br /><br />Like I said it's a fantastic story, for young AND old. Especially for someone who loves to read about Greek Mythology. Rick Riordan really created an amazing world full of gods and other mythical creatures. He even makes it believable by introducing Mist. The veil that keeps the world of the gods from being seen by mundanes. It's very funny when Percy's veil was lifted and he could suddenly see everything that was kept from him. The story is also quite good and exciting. It's a great puzzle to find out who did it. Who stole Zeus's lightning. I loved the hints and dead ends I was given. The twists and turns. Even for someone who already saw the movie (and so knew how it ended ;) ), I was never completely sure I got it right ^^<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />4 HEARTS.  This book proves that books are usually better than movies and some stories can be read by everyone, regardless their age. It also proves that it never grows old to read about the Greek gods and their latest antics. It has an intriguing mystery, that will keep you guessing till the last page and a good dose of humor. A lovely book I can recommend to everyone ^^how it ended ;) ), I was never completely sure I got it right ^^<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />4 HEARTS.

B009X01C64|5.0|I love this product.  It works as advertised.  Makes reading and using my Kindle a pleasure.  If you like to &#34;prop&#34; up your book for reading this product is for you.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased this chromecast to see how I would like it. It turned out that I can't stop using it . I did have to use the adapter to get a batter signal.<br />The picture quality is amazing to say the least. I must say for the cost this item is worth it . I have another one on order with amazon, so I will have two of them on hand once they are back in stock.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Definitely not happy with the updated app. My &quot;quick picks&quot; boards never work, all that ever shows up are my first few boards. They never change. Scrolling is near impossible at times. It wants to lock io every few minutes. When I want to pin something, it'll take forever to load the boards then lock up again. I'm forever having to force a shut down on the app to do anything. Frankly, I would rather just use Pinterest on the computer than deal with this fiasco.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Rothfuss is at least as ambition as that other guy writing about dragons and winter coming. That's why I don't understand the criticism of this book being messy and not moving the story forward. For me it is positively FILLED with important back-story and partial answers to many questions I had from the first book. It is really more like 3 -- maybe more -- books in one. Still, there are plenty of hints to move the story forward into a 3rd, 4th and 5th book. The Maer-Lackless connection to secrets as old as the Chandrian is just one example and you can bet the origin of the sword Kvothe receives from the Adem is likely to be another. My only reservation here is how long I will have to wait -- but that is just the internet immediacy spoiled kid in me. This is a finely crafted product and it is apparent to me that there is a much larger story that Rothfuss has to tell and he will take his sweet time to do it. I also found plenty in this book to round out Kvothe as a character and I think that some people forget that at this point in the story he is still a very young man who still only understands a little about himself. Or -- maybe they have just forgotten what it was like to be 19 or 20 with hormone still racing but the barest inklings of what real maturity might entail. For me, Kvothe's experience from this perspective came across very clearly. Even with all of the back-story I found this book to be just as much of a page turner as the first -- if only to find out where he was going to end up -- because I knew from the start that it would not be the end of the story. This is why I call it the perfect second book.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I found interesting to see and to know more about music I loved so much, even &#34;the technical&#34; part is interesting.<br />Basically is a movie on &#34;love&#34;, you ...discover now why!<br /><br />Flower Power! :D
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Not only does it give you insight into the life of a kid going through the foster system, but also provides insights on a little know topic about the lost art of communication through flowers.  It is also filled with interesting, multi-dimensional characters and a compelling storyline.  Highly recommended.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Visually it is perfect, so are the effects. The house with the pool high in the sky is a design perfection.<br />The story isn't maybe super-innovative and I'll say in some point confusing or confused.<br />Nevertheless, if you like sci-fi you can't skip this.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This season does not disappoint.  The writing is exceptional and makes you beg for more.  Twists in story lines, epic reveals, and terrific acting make this season unforgettable.  But, that describes every season of Doctor Who, doesn't it?
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this Star Wars edition is too funny!!!<br />If you like to play time to time can't really skip this!<br />P.S.<br />I don't like this trend present in late games of buying parts or to pay to skip something.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is hard to put down. Kept me engaged and wanting to keep reading. Just glad there is another book in this series!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Maybe not the most 'precise' game on the market but it is funny funny funny!<br />I was asking myself about the 'politically correct' aspect that I didn't notice watching the movie: is it right to make small, yellow, bizarrely speaking guys (do this remind nobody to you?) fun of?<br /><br />...I know it is a cartoon and a game...<br /><br />P.S.<br />I don't like this trend present in late games of buying parts or to pay to skip something.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I would recommend this book to teenage readers who are just starting to read twilight breaking dawn! You will understand when you read this book
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun and easy way to past time or relax.<br />Graphics could be little better and when selecting random game only about 10 percent are winning deals.
B001NLKS16|5.0|Its awesome reading things from johns point of view. Cant wait for the new season!! Supernatural fans shoukdbhave this book
1591396190|5.0|Blue Ocean vs. Red Ocean is a total reframe of how to see the world. Moving from a world of competition/taking out the competition/overcoming the competition to creating a whole new ocean. It's exactly how capitalism and good business should work.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very good for a free app. If you do not mind waiting for your power to regenerate,  this game can be played for free. The graphics are good too.
1612680011|4.0|The idea is good, but it is not practical to most Americans. I would stick with what comes by and grab the opportunity instead of saving money and investing it.
0307744434|5.0|I did not want to read this book. It appeared to be silly fantasy, within a circus of all things! I only read it so not to hurt my friend's feelings. It was one of the best books I've ever read and I'm 60 yrs old. I completely lost myself in it, wonderful!
B0098VXN2Y|4.0|Funny movie but it does touch on some of the realities of being pregnant and the stresses that come with it.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Like all good sci fi, it was a bit slow at the start, unfortunately packing all the exposition that would normally be chapter after chapter into the hour means that some of the finesse of the story telling was lost.<br /><br />Overall an Excellent Movie. The second half made up for the first half, although it true sci fi fashion it would have benefitted from either being a series or an extended version like the multi dvd Dune.<br /><br />Tom Cruise played it straight, a few more quirks and human foibles in the first half would have aided his rise from run of the mill citizen to warrior and hero better. I'm sure there could have been more useful stuff written for both Morgan and Olga. Morgan was mainly for exposition and he does a fine job, Olga transitioned from her recovery a little strange with little room in the story. Lets face it 2 hours is not a long time. The Mission Control was sufficiently annoying with the \\"are you an effective team\\" you just hope someone shuts her up by the end of the movie...<br /><br />A good measure of Sci Fi is whether it leaves you asking more questions at the end. They are a modern version of parables, giving good food for thought. It left me with a number of questions, none of which I will share as they would obviously spoil the movie for others.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Great puzzles for all levels of expertise. I would recommend it for all. I can't wait for the next one.
B004BSWC8A|5.0|Great movie. Beautiful scenery and very exciting. Especially love the dog. A reminder to us all how important family time is.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a fun app. My 10 year old daughter helps me with it. I have just started playing it though.
B008645YH6|2.0|As a fan of Marina and the Diamonds first album, I was thoughoughly underwhelmed by the second.  Overproduced, repetitive and dull are the words that come to mind while subjecting myself to this.  Sounding more and more like every other mainstream pop princess is not what I expected.  Whereas her first was inventive and surprising, this is just par for the course and a sad attempt to get more airplay by appealing to the least common denominator....loud beats and synthetic music.  Emotional content is absent and lyrics are banal in the extreme.  It's not even interesting as a guilty pleasure.  Hopefully it will be back to the drawing board for her next one.
0679805273|5.0|This was purchased for some neighbors who were moving away.  They were both emergency physcians and worked with children.<br /><br />Would probably purchase again.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I am a Brony of sorts, and I give this movie five stars.<br />When one of my little buddies found out that I had ordered the BluRay version of MLP-EG, she decided to<br />have a slumber party where she and all of her little friends could spend an evening watching it.<br />Then she asked me if they could watch my copy, depending on the Power of Cuteness to get her way, as<br />little girls so often do.<br />Her parents wisely decided that they had plans for that night, and that it was my duty to babysit, as it was,<br />after all, my copy of the movie that started the whole thing rolling. Or snowballing, as it turned out.<br />So I found myself playing sheepdog for the night to an avalanche of adorability. Watching Equestria Girls<br />over and over. With repeats of the most popular scenes, like the Cafeteria rally.<br />Y'know, I liked it. The little girls, who comprised it's target audience, loved it. Five stars, indeed.<br /><br />Now, let me address some of the critics here on Amazon:<br />#1, this movie was not meant to represent any particular type of schoolkid. I doubt if there were very many<br />fat girls who walked away from this movie feeling sad because no character looked like them. If there were,<br />then they have way more problems that any movie can counter.<br />In fact, I doubt if there were any black-haired, chocolate skinned darlings who walked away sad for the<br />same reason. Or any lighter-shinned or Asian girls, either. Face it, under those circumstances, the only<br />girls who would be satisfied would be the punks, goths, emos and other alts. Because most of the<br />characters in this movie, even the adults, looked like nobody in real life. Because, y'know, purple skin?<br />Green hair?<br />Don't get me started on body image. OH MY GOD! This movie is telling little girls that their ideal body would<br />have their feet amputated to fit them into stubby tube boots! Waaahhhh! Evil!<br />Get real, folks. It's a movie, not a life-changing event.<br /><br />#2, this movie was produced for little girls, not Bronies. So the whole ponies-as-humans line of whining is<br />pretty much a wash. The target audience loves it, and that's all that matters.<br />In fact, why are the Bronies complaining so vociferously about the writers doing something THAT BRONIES<br />THEMSELVES DO SO MUCH OF? Just do a search for &#34;Pony Porn&#34; sometime... Rather, don't. What you will<br />see can never be unseen. Just don't.<br /><br />#3, the movie was a little preachy in spots. Yeah, a movie that shows different groups of kids like rockers,<br />artists, jocks and ecos cooperating to accomplish good goals is a bad thing right? The target audience<br />seemed to like it, so get stuffed.<br /><br />In the end, I will give this movie five stars. It was well written, with a good story and message, the artistic<br />style was faithful to the MLP series, and the characters' personalities and behaviors were faithful to their<br />MLP prototypes. I especially liked all of the background characters that you could recognize as<br />background characters from the MLP series, like Photo Finish and others. They even had their cutie marks<br />worked into the decorations on their clothing, which was a nice touch.<br /><br />But the major reason for my giving it five stars has little to do with the fact that I enjoyed watching it.<br />The major reason is that the little girls I know enjoyed watching it. And in the end, that's what matters.<br />Priorities, people!
B000SE0OYA|5.0|Ordered it, got it in a few days, took me two minutes to installed.... the Toner Full message is gone and the printer is working.  Can't beat that...  I will give you a updated report after I use my printer for a week.
B001KZVQJI|4.0|I expected a bit more of a logical film even though the basic premises are a bit crazy.  Yet, I wanted to see it so I ordered it.  The cast was a mixed bag with some wonderful artists present in it.  The members of the group, by and large, seem to survive some falls, etc that would certainly do most of us a ticket to the Great Movies in the Sky.  It is just a matter of my mixed expectations that did me in a bit and, yes, I am old enough to remember the original.  Maybe that's the problem.  And, the events seemed to be staged too long.  This made for a movie that did not need to be this long.  Still, for absolute well filmed craziness, I do recommend it with a few reservations.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Not just the best case for the money but it's great for protecting device from drops. Because its so straightforward and thin it's just a great case. Fits easily in your pocket. I've dropped phone many times over the last year and haven't driven front or back. Love this case.
B0073COMUW|5.0|These relatively inexpensive led bulbs do a great job in our bathroom (4) they fit in our fixtures perfectly they are daylight white as advertised do not like \\"soft\\" white too yellow for me. They are instant on. How long they will last remains to be determined started using them in April 2013. Not dimmable but in the bathroom who needs it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush it's so fun.  I play it almost every day.I hope all of you people love it
B008XKT9FG|5.0|Really enjoyed this, many lines and old sayings approiate for today's world actually watched it twice, when I saw it I wanted my adult daughter to see it she happened over the next evening and watched it she founde it equally inspiring
B00CC1JXYE|3.0|it's fast to demage, i don't recomend this item to any one, and it's too expensive comparing to similar products.
B007THA4FI|1.0|The WORST book I have ever read! Can't believe it is by the same author as the Harry Potter Series.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|brings back the memories and classic feel of missle based games. great game to kill some time with. fun addicting game!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|interesting to see the view from the affected person, could relate to some signs I saw with my mother in law.  Amazed at how well Alice handled her situation and could prepare herself and those around her.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|If you like find it games this is good for you. The story line/ plot could have a bigger part in the game but it's still a good game. The searches are difficult and make you think plus the puzzles rock!
1452126607|3.0|Lots of beautiful big pictures of everyone's favourite cat - though a different one for each month would be great for 2015!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|What little girl wouldn't' like these? And they even sparkle -- an added bonus. My grand daughters really enjoyed putting these up on their walls.

B000SEHJGQ|5.0|My first Bukowski, I flew threw it, loved it, going to start Factotum right now. Give this book a try, a very enjoyable read.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I love the fantasy.  This kind of book is a feel good read. If you liked this book I would also recommend The Snow Child
B00006DEFA|5.0|Movie is great, don't waste your time in viewing the directors cut, not only boring but the actors recollections suck.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|great to have it on dvd to watch whenever without commercial interuption and rewind to understand the plot better.. great acting
B000KJT8IG|4.0|This movie with Chevy Chase is the perfect définition of this acronym : lol . One of the most funny movie i ever saw.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I remember watching this movie and reading the book in school. It was as good as I remembered it was at the time.
B001DF68MA|5.0|It is exactly what I was looking for , great price and fast shipping , very easy to mount to bike and very sturdy and safe
B002SSUQFG|3.0|In terms of quality it seemed pretty good. But the size of the watch really killed it for me. It looked like  more of a women's watch than mans watch to be honest.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The sound and picture quality of this Blu-ray surpasses all my other Blu-rays! I don't know if it's the old filming style or what, but this Blu-ray is my favorite one to watch!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|it's ok. boring at first (upgrade is part of the game, not the typical upgrade for no ads), then fun, then boring again.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|I have been waiting for this to be released onto Blu-ray format since Blu-rays came out! I will watch this 6 times a year or more! One of the best movie musicals of all time. Barbara gives me goose bumps!
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|This game is so cute. I love the little pirates. I suck at strategy games so this is far more challenging than I expected.  I am getting it slowly but surely.  I would recommend this game to any playmobil fans. It is like living out the pirate adventures from my childhood.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|I watch this movie once a month, and since getting the Blu-ray I probably watch it twice a month! I love this film, and it's even better on Blu-ray.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I just had cataract surgery and had to put one drop of two different medicines four times a day.  After surgery I had to put in one drop of three different medicines five minutes apart.  Thank goodness for My Alarm Clock!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great action and challenging levels.  Should be easier to get coins though. Would be great to add a new world and more achievements
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Excellent storyline.  The action scenes were great. Best use of the Hulk in a movie.  I can not wait for the next movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this game! It makes you think outside the box. I cannot wait until the next levels are available.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It was creative and interesting at times but became repetitive and monotonous. No characters to care about or become attached to.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This book is hands down amazing!! I didn't think that the second book would be as good, but in my opinion, it was better than the first!!!!!!!!!!!! If Chris doesn't write another book, I will shrivel up and die
B000MV8XPG|5.0|We purchased this toy for my son's 3 year birthday. He is completely in love with construction vehicles. He is a larger 3 year old and this toy is large enough for him to use now and to grow in to. It also is durable and easy to use. We take it to the park and play in the volleyball sand court.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Very fast; overclocks easily to 3.6 GHz.  Would it have been even better to spend a few dollars more an get a 3570K?  Can't say.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best Temple run style game out there. Fun for me and my kids. Highly recommend this game. Love me some minions !!!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A great quick read by Gaiman. I tend to devour anything he writes, and this is no exception. It was enjoyable, kept me hooked, and had Gaiman's signature rich fantasy world.<br /><br />It also somehow completely captures the frustration of being a child in an adult's world.<br /><br />Read it.
1432794426|5.0|defending a king is a good book, I love to read about michael jackson best book I ever read.[[ASIN:0741470314 Defending a King ~ His Life & Legacy]]I recommend this book I read it2 times and love it. karen did a wonderful job writing this book.

B008476HBM|5.0|How else would anyone rate Jane Austin but spectacular?  Her characters come alive and the lifestyle of the period is perfectly imparted.  She is a great read.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Once the words grabbed me, they wouldn't let go.  Although I was tempted to immediately read another title by Neil Gaiman, I feared disappointment. I'll have to try him again after the enchantment has wained.
0385341008|1.0|I was hoping to buy a brand new book for my friend since she is really careful about her book condition and when this book arrived I noticed the spine of the book looked worn which is easily the most frustrating thing and the edges of the book look a bit bent. Very unsatisfied with the condition of the book and the fact it was rated &#34;new&#34; Maybe &#34;very good&#34; would have been appropriate but &#34;new&#34; implies that it is new.
B0056TYT66|3.0|This product does not come with a disc with the drivers on it. You need to go online and download them to even get started. I ran the necessary installation files and I expected everything to work, as well I should. It was not so simple. I uninstalled and reinstalled. I tried different combinations. I re-downloaded the drivers... What finally worked was that I had device manger open with the item listed but not properly installed and by chance I right clicked on the device and selected update driver. From there I went to where the drivers were installed and I selected the location (x64) and that worked. I now have USB 3.0 on my computer. I have not yet gotten around to installing a sata hard drive on this controller. I'll try to update when I do. For now it works well as a USB 3.0 port for an external hard drive. PS you need to also get a power splitter cable for molex or sata power. When shopping on Amazon the only one not being sent from China cost a little more than I would have like to pay. But I wanted the controller up and working within the month, so I spent ~$13-14 just for the stupid splitter cable.
B000QY9WOU|5.0|A great concert caught on video!  Cher is an amazing entertainer!  I wish I had seen her live in concert.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Superior acting and direction of the highest caliber. Emily Blunt is sensational. Wardrobes and decor helped create the appropriate era.<br />An outstanding production in every respect.
B00BAYLS1K|5.0|Mock-U-Mentary on ballroom dancing in Australia.  Funny movie.  Characters and story are enjoyable.  Costumes are fantastic and over the top.  Make-up is excessive, but that's intentional.  First time I saw this movie, I missed the first ten minutes and thought it was a real documentary... until it switched gears from the 'interview' part.  I was hooked.  Music in the film is also fun to listen to.
B003THN75G|5.0|I was recommended this show by a friend in England. What a trip, huh? He recommended Castle, I recommended Luther.<br /><br />Within the first three minutes, I was hooked! Great filming, interesting storyline, and the cast? Well, I Love Love Firefly (SciFi was totally stupid to shut that show down!) and Nathan Fillion, who played Captain Malcolm Reynolds is the star - how cool is THAT?! He plays an author of suspense/crime novels who is brought in when a killer uses set-ups from his novels as the basis for a string of murders. Stana Katic (Quantum of Solace) plays the cop who is assigned the case.<br /><br />There is a great deal of humour in this episode, which I hope will continue through the series, as I intend to watch them all. One scene where Castle drops a handcuff key and has to pick it up with his toes? I thought I was the only person who used my toes like fingers, LOL.<br /><br />The chemistry between the actors is perfect, the tone is light (unlike the more extreme cop and CSI shows out there today) and overall the show was extremely enjoyable.<br /><br />I look forward to watching the rest of the episodes!
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|My favorite of the Bond songs.  Would have helped if the buyer had removed the $2.50, sticker before sending it too me after charging me far more.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is ok. It takes a long time to load once you get a perfect. I don't think it would be worth one dollar. You should get it when it is the free app of the day.
B00E66QPCG|2.0|Even though it's clear that the author put a lot of effort into writing this volume, I didn't find anything useful in it and it was a waste of my time. You can find this common sense on the internet and in all basic trading books. Put your money elsewhere.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup was easy. Was casting a webpage from Chrome within minutes. Took me longer to find the extension for Chrome than anything else. Looking forward to additional capabilities.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a cool game and it is great because you don't have to have wi -ti to use it. Energy can get annoying though.
B001TD1XWG|4.0|It's nice to see lil Wayne do something alittle different. It's no where near the best cd he made but its still decent. I enjoyed it.
B00CKOQC9C|3.0|Some parts were a bit slow and I got bored, and in the beginning some parts were a little confusing but later on when u read the book, you will understand. Good book
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Makes you think quite a bit. A great way to kill some time, yet still work out you brain. I've been stuck on the same level for a week now. The one with a hand and it looks like it's moving, then some lips. If anyone could help, it would be greatly appreciated.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Very fun, after a couple chapters I'm still enjoying the search.  I hope I can make it through this game. Got stuck on another game, so here is to making my way to the end.
B009AY04A8|3.0|Not that cool.a typical find it game with lots of dialogue.I tried to play it on my android tablet and every time I zoomed in or swiped to look somewhere else it penalized me for&quot;random tapping&quot;.definitely nothing special.
B009AY04A8|2.0|Pinch to zoom = Incorrect tap: -20sec<br /><br />Pan left = Incorrect tap: -20sec<br /><br />Pan right = Incorrect tap: -20sec<br /><br />Pan up = Incorrect tap: -20sec<br /><br />Pan down = Incorrect tap: -20sec<br /><br />Zoom out = Incorrect tap: -20sec
B0088W4YTK|5.0|I love the interaction of the characters, very similar to the interaction from the Star Gate one series.  The action is non stop.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is addictive. I was up playing at 2am but then I just got it. The horse is realistic looking.
030758836X|1.0|This is NOT a thriller but kinda twisted love story. If you are looking for a plausible thriller or crime story, don't waste your time on this. The book doesn't require a deeper thinking that it is very easy to finish the book but I still wish that I read something else that is interesting.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very few books have actually made me cry, while reading this book I thought about all of the other books I have read in this life...... out of all of them this one means the most....
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Although it only supports just a few apps at this time, the Chrromecast does the one thing that my Roku can't and that's playing YouTube.  Now I can watch World Superbike, and much more on my big screen.<br /><br />Setup was very simple.  The apps work rightaway, no issues at all.  The best part is that I got the 3 months Netflix credit making the Chromecast around $12 after tax.  For all the people that complain about lack of apps, for me just having YouTube on my big screen TV is worth the $12.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game because it's more fun than any other running game; temple run, streaker run, etc. I think it's cool that you can dress different characters. This game is just so colourful and awesome. You MUST get this app.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Good who dun nit.  David Tennant is always a worthwhile watch.  Anxious to see how the mystery unfolds as have only seen 3 episodes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Nothing more to say than this book is absolutely amazing.  I cant wait for the movie to come out. :)
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Good game for everyone but quite the same all the stages should have some difference between them. Maybe if you could have other things to shoot not just missiles
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am an 11year old and I think this is the best book I have ever read! It is amazing how Suzzane Collins wrote this book. Well at first the book was boring until I had 150 page of the book left. It is a very violent story but at the same time it has something meaning ful in it. I am off to buy the third and last book of the hunger game series. Ah if there were more. I would also like to tell you that the movie catching fire will be out on November 22 (Friday) ! Have fun reading!<br />  -reader Julie-
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|It's nice to see some real talent to counter the overprocessed music that has been inundating the airwaves.  I am looking forward to more of Lorde.
B000067FP8|5.0|Grandchildren love this movie  ordered Gizmo doll they love as well to watch the movie every time they sleep over
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read- can't wait for the movie.  The book keeps you in suspence and wondering until the ending which is unexpected.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is almost exactly like owning a horse, without the hard work! It is a great teacher for anyone thinking about buying a horse and competing.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cheryl Stayed writing stype has ability to put you on on the trail with her and make you feel the weight and pain of every step as well as visualize the beauty of the scenery and feel the heat of the blazing sun.  This is an excellent story as it weaves her journey on the Pacific Crest Trail with her unusual and sometimes tragic life story.

B001UW58WW|5.0|If you like violin, and you like &#34;modern&#34; music, give David Garrett a listen.  He blends classical violin with modern music, and the result is not short of spectacular.<br /><br />Heck, even if you don't consider yourself a lover of the violin, you may become one after hearing David Garrett perform.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|This is a good story, but often I found myself irritated by the protagonist and her stubborn inability to get over herself. Still, I recommend it!
1451626096|5.0|Love this writer. She does a wonderful job of making history very readable and entertaining. I have all her books and glad she is still writing..
B004EPZ07K|5.0|The best superhero movie I've seen! Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast in the main role! Geoffrey Rush is also great in his role of Tomar-Re! Funny and action packed is a great combination and this movie delivers those types of moments in spades! Highly Recommended!

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I had already known that we are all connected, that thoughts become things, Law of Attraction and the like when this book appeared on my Book Gorilla list.  It wasn't that expensive, so I figured I would get it just for fun.  I had already read so much, I didn't expect to learn anything else.  And I was wrong. There is so much good info here.  I still have 3 experiments to do yet, but the ones I have done so far have worked and were fun to do.<br /><br />When doing the experiments, it is important to make a commitment to doing it.  You have to set the intention and believe it will work.  If you are skepticle, just wanting to see if it will work, then it probably won't work.  And you have to pay attention.  Watch for it come and expect it to come.<br /><br />This book is also fun to read.  Her friend coming up with that spider got to me.  I'd like to know what happened with that.  I'm still seeing green cars everywhere.
0810989956|5.0|My nephew is a Wimpy Kid fan; he was not expecting this book. Immediately he started to write in it, it must be fun to read it when you get to be older. I have recommended it to a few moms and grandmas
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not as good as The Kite Runner, but a worthy read. Hosseini spins a good story, but his first is still his best.
0062255657|1.0|How did this book get so many good reviews??  It was the worst excuse for a book I can recall reading...  I made it 70% of the way through.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Like the game a lot. Just wish it didn't have the ads, that would have got it a higher rating.
B00BEIYH6U|2.0|I really liked the first Kick-Ass.  I thought that it made some good changes to Mark Millar's graphic novel and recreated the really fun tale of regular people turned heroes.  When Kick-Ass 2 was announced, I was stoked...until I found out that Matthew Vaughn was no longer going to be involved in the movie (as more than a producer).  Jeff Wadlow wrote and directed the sequel, his first rated R adventure.  So...did it kick ass?<br /><br />I'll start off my review by saying that Kick-Ass 2's story is an absolute mess.  I'm familiar with the source material, and I know some liberties had to be made with the story for the screen (some of the violence in the book is disgusting), but the characters here seem like that have little to no motivation to do anything.  Kick-Ass gets back into the crime fighting game...because he's bored.  One of Kick-Ass's friends becomes a super hero because...it seems cool.  Hit Girl gets back into the crime fighting game because...she's basically also bored.  Certain characters seem completely forgotten about.  This script is, simply put, a disaster.<br /><br />There are several really fun, really well done scenes here.  The 'van' scene (hinted at in the trailer) is outstanding.  Mother Russia showing the NYPD that she means business is another stand out scene.  However, the rest of the movie seems entirely forgettable, with the exception of Jim Carrey's charismatic turn as Captain Stars & Stripes.<br /><br />The direction is competent.  Wadlow lets the action breathe a bit instead of getting up close and personal with the shaky cam that I hate so much, so I did appreciate that.  You can actually tell what's going on.  The CGI blood is a little distracting (why don't we just use squibs anymore?).  The acting is competent, although Mintz-Plasse is even more annoying here than he was in the first one.<br /><br />Here's my bottom line...going into Kick-Ass 2, expect the following - a terrible story, some cool action scenes, and a ton of dick jokes.  Aside from a handful of scenes, this won't be a movie that you remember in a year.  Hell, you may not even remember most of it as you exit the theater.  It's definitely not as good as the first one.<br /><br />Final Score: 2/5kes.  Aside from a handful of scenes, this won't be a movie that you remember in a year.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought two of these hours after they were announced, and the preorder shipped them with Prime on August 30h.  It takes a bit of tech savviness to get these configured and running with your TV, PC and iPhone, but once the configuration routines completed across devices, watching youtube on the PC and streaming to the TV was amazing.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|this movie is a good, feel good movie. As usual, Sandra Bullock does a super job. highly recommend this movie.

B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Spaceballs!?!  Oh s***, there goes the planet!  So many great one liners, John Candy as a MOG, and no one could have been dark helmet better than Rick Moranis.  Great casting for this movie, glad to have it in my library on something other than VHS.
1439152802|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it.  There were some points where I felt it dragged and felt anxious to get on with it.  The book kept my attention though and in the end I was not disappointed.  After finishing the book I concluded it is best not to speculate but to let the story unfold right up to the end.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This season was a masterpiece.  It's deep philosophical and religious bent may elude some viewers, because they are intrigued by the violence.  However, this is more than just a super-charged adrenaline ride, it is the story of a man's search for meaning in his life and the life of others.

B004SYP5WC|3.0|I got this when it was a Free App of the Day and was very happy with it....until my Bionic upgraded to ICS. Then it no longer would remind me of an upcoming bill. If I open it daily I will get a warning (if it's 5 days away), but if I forget to do that, it'll just warn me that it'd due right away. That sorta kills the concept of an app that will remind me of a bill.<br /><br />I say to get it on the Play store as this version hasn't been updated for some time. Here it's version 1.0.5 while on the Play Store it's 1.0.6. Maybe the newer version will remind me. Do I want to pay or maybe see another app?
B005ZO6NRA|4.0|Yes, I agree the plot is not too interesting, but it had good action and some cool special affects.  Just wish the Rock had been in there somewhere :-)  Enjoy.
B00821OX98|4.0|Have been wanting to see this for a while. Have always loved Noah Wylie. The only thing I don't like about apocalypse-type movies and TV shows is how wasteful everyone always is...it really bothers me! That could be the last candle or can of tuna you ever see...be frugal with it!
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is a very good version of Mahjong.  My only suggesion would be that you allow it to shift to the orientation preference of the user. Right now I have to play the game upside down to keep it plugged into the charger.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the best streaming product for YouTube and Netflix. Only its missing Amazon Prime and On Demand streaming... come on Amazon make an app for this...you've sold way over a hundred thousand units. Wouldn't you want to sell to those people? I know I would buy more movies and series from Amazon if they had an app for Chromecast.<br /><br />Definitely easier to use than GoogleTv. And using your Android  phone or Chrome browser on a laptop to control it makes it so easy to use.<br /><br />Seriously,  Amazon get to work:)
0316010669|4.0|I would highly recommend this non-fiction book by the author of the best-selling book Tipping Point - which I also loved.  This book offers a unique view of \\"thinking without thinking\\".<br /><br />It presents a well researched look at how our \\"over-thinking\\" can be detrimental to us, and how we should listen more often to our \\"gut instincts\\" and intuition. This is especially true in this era of information overload, where we often find ourselves paralysed with so many options and choices.<br /><br />Gladwell writes in a compelling manner  that keeps you reading and gives you plenty to think about.  You too will most likely find yourself nodding away with him throughout the book.<br /><br />Diana Young, #1 Amazon best-selling author of Financial Fitness for Beginners and world traveler, currently sailing for six months each year in the South Pacific.

B002VPEAM6|3.0|An attempt to capture the mystical characteristics of a devote Muslim with a grand vision for the Hadramawt in Yemen.  The lack of in-depth descriptions of the characters and the lands, watered down the plot and overall quality of the novel.  Torday did not allow the story to reach its tremendous potential.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Hi, I thought the idea is great. It work well with Netflix and Youtube.<br />Tried it on ABC, CBS shows and those are fragmented. Hope Google will update that.

0156027321|4.0|'Life of Pi' captures the beauty of storytelling and the power of an individual's imagination.  Through the story of a boy stranded at sea, the reader is given insight into the human will to live and the seemingly endless capabilities of the human mind and body.  The reader is left to determine the true happenings of the boy, but this was done quick and harshly, leaving the reader dizzy.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I rate it a 3 because it took a long time to get through it. Also because it very closely followed the storyline of the matrix. Come on think of something new.
B0000DZ3IG|3.0|This movie was recommended to us by our daughter's boyfriend. It's actually his favorite! But certainly not our's. We prefer a movie that is a little bit less complicated and typical. The shipping, however, was actually delivered rather quickly.<br />I suggest borrowing it, ordering it for free and watching it before buying.
0316228583|2.0|I knew from the first that this would be a departure from Harry Potter, but I was disappointed in the entire book.  It was very hard to get started, but since others seemed to have reviewed the book without finishing, I decided to see if I could get through the text.  I did, but I am not richer for it.  There were too many characters and I simply could not keep them all straight, especially since some of the names were frequently interchanged with nicknames.  The tone of the book was quite melancholy, which was fine, but the greatest failing is that the characters were not interesting.  I simply did not care about them.  The author managed to write a pedantic book without passion, and I know she has the capability to do better.  The book is a disappointment and I can think of many other ways to spend your time.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I had never heard this story before and I find it to be just incredible.  At the same time, it's rather sad to me so I was pretty much a mess after it was over.  It is not something I could watch very often but it is very well done and worth seeing!
0374214913|1.0|A mystery filled with action that those familiar with recent technology would appreciate.  The plot incorporates a modern theme into a Dan Brown esque timeline, that was uncommonly predicable.  There was very little character development and Sloan left teh reader wanting nothing, leaving very little motivation to keep reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its a really great game! Fun for all ages. The controls and graphics are very good. You do have to pay to get coins which unlock certian things but that usnt very overpowering.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|We saw 'Lincoln' on Netflix and just had to order the special edition that we will never open because it is sure to become a classic!!<br />I highly recommend this to teachers of teaching Jr. High AND High School kids!<br />And to parents who want to share a piece (more like peace) of our true history!
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|This is such a great app. I feel things such as joy, peace and comfort when I use this program. It puts the best intentions in my heart when each Angel card comes up. It encourages prayer for the beautiful card you draw

B00BNWWVFG|5.0|Steven Soderbergh's Side Effects sneaked into the theaters and while I was busy dusting my room it exited just as quietly.  Wish I had seen this on the big screen because it is the best Brian De Palma film since Femme Fatale at least, maybe Raising Cain.  However Netflix provided it just fine, though what is with their new policy of suppressing extras on their rental copies--you have to buy the DVD is you want to see \\"Behind the Scenes of Side Effects\\"?  Good thing I didn't really want to see more of the movie (except maybe of the titanic love scene between Rooney Mara and Channing Tatum) otherwise I might have been serious;y pissed and that ain't pleasant!<br /><br />By now (since this is the 510th review on this site) you probably know the general drift of the movie and how reviewers can't really talk about it past the first 20 minutes or so of the film, otherwise they will be revealing some serious spoilers.  In fact just announcing that there are twists and turns in a film is sort of a spoiler, isn't it?  From the very beginning one is on the lookout, especially when the reviewer says, \\"Things are not what they seem.\\"  But that's just what happens in this.  I for one, even knowing that things are not what they seem, was totally unprepared for the death around which the rest of the story revolves.  Perhaps this is what audiences felt like when Janet Leigh went into the shower in Psycho, and something they just didn't expect occurred on the screen.  But, and I hate to say it, but there's a good chance that Rooney Mara out Psycho's Anthony Perkins in this movie.  She won't win the Oscar, but Tony Perkins didn't either, and the two of them will forever live in the category of immortal screen performances.  I saw the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and it was OK, but here she takes acting to a new level and seems to be having the time of her life doing it!  Maybe David Fincher was overcontrolling and Soderbergh allows her to do whatever she likes on film, but from Mara's very first entrance you know something has changed and she has become a great star.  I wish I had Pauline Kael's way with words, for Kael wrote beautifully about Jane Fonda's emergence from kook oddity to acting greatness when she reviewed They Shoot Horses, Don't They, naming Jane Fonda as the natural successor to Bette Davis--and that shocked The New Yorker readers at the time, for to them Fonda was Barbarella or the girl from Barefoot in the Park.  You know what this movie reminded me of (I mean Side Effects)?  Most of you are too young, but years ago there was a movie called Malice, with Alec Baldwin as a doctor and Bill Paxton and Nicole Kidman as, you know I don't remember what they were (college professors?) and the whole movie shifted after forty minutes into the kind of thing you can't believe you're seeing, allowing, if I may put it this way, Kidman a chance to flex her acting muscles for the first time.  After that, people stopped saying, wow, she's tall, is she from Australia?  Just like Rooney Mara here, she wanted to be bad.  Not good-bad, but evil.<br /><br />OK, Side Effects isn't very good as a movie perhaps (neither was Malice come to think of it) but nowadays any film that provides something a little bit different is worth hunting down, and this has it in Spades.  Maybe it was a mistake to cast Jude Law in the central role, it's too soon after Soberbergh's Contagion in which he was also obsessed with the side effects of pharmaceuticals?  This hits too close to some, baby!  These roles, together with his parts in Gattaca and A.I., show very little range but reveal why he is probably Donna Haraway's favorite star if I know my cyborg theory....s very first entrance you know something has changed and she has become a great star.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This product promised to work with my TV and computer, but it would not connect.  I tried many times to contact Google, but no one could help me over the phone.  I was transferred around a million times, and finally they told me to contact my ISP.  They hadn't even heard of a Chromecast.  Bad service and a product that just doesn't work.  Stick with Roku.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|Some say this won't lay flat. Not true. Just lay it face down when you aren't using it for the first few days after &#34;rolling&#34; the spine a bit, and it will start to and continue to lay perfectly flat.<br /><br />It also is very attractive, giving your Kindle the appearance of a fine leather bound book. A nice anachronism.
B00CJGP116|4.0|After missing for nearly a decade from the salsa scene Marc Anthony and producer Sergio George prove they have the winning combination on the genre.<br /><br />Songs are well arranged, amazing musicality and Marc's voice does not disappoint. The songs however don't have a familiar tone to them, therefore not becoming instant classics as others from the past. It will definitely grow on you and if you're a fan you wont mind listening to the entire production 5 times before you have a favorite. If you're not a fan you will grow tired of not being able to sing along any of his songs the 3rd time you hear it.<br /><br />Whichever way it is great to have Marc back on the scene!

We were excited with the first few epispodes but things slow down considerably after about 3 or 4 episodes of Season 3.<br /><br />We are just over halfway thru Season 3 so hopefully things will turn and the season will end strong however the last few episodes have been painfully slow to watch without much excitement.

B00873GRU4|3.0|And I'm always a sucker for this kind of stuff, but; it's a bit too close to the plot line of A Discovery of Witches and without that book's interesting factual/historical detail. An okay read for a bit of fun, not sure I'll bother with the next one.

B0094ZJK4O|4.0|So, amidst all of the drama going on between Richie Sambora and Jon Bon Jovi these days, I finally had an opportunity to listen to Richie's latest album, Aftermath Of The Lowdown. I am a fan of both of his previous solo efforts, Stranger In This Town and Undiscovered Soul, and this release follows in the same footsteps. His blues influences are prominently worn on his sleeve through the majority of the album with my only quibble being a somewhat lack luster production that tries a bit too hard to sound like a modern rock album when he would be better off just being himself or at least adopting a Don Was approach to the mixdown (Bon Jovi has fallen into the same trap on occasion, sometimes rejecting the genre entirely i.e. Lost Highway!) Highlight tracks are Every Road Leads You Home, Nowadays, Seven Years Gone and my fav, Learning How To Fly With A Broken Wing. This is a great result that contains more gems than the past three BJ releases combined IMHO. Regardless of whether or not he has withdrawn from the band entirely or this particular tour, it would almost be criminal for him not to hit the road and perform this material along with his vast 30 year old catalog.

B0039PPW60|1.0|I sent this back to amazon and got a Mackie instead. The tape inputs didn't work, the USB didn't work. The think kinda had a cheap feel too it as well, The buttons just felt like they would pop off and any time. The manual for the thing is about worthless and I'm talking about the one you have to download not the quick setup book that comes with it. Save yourself some frustration and get something else. For just a bit more money you can get the Mackie proFX8 and have something that does everything it says it will.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I waited so long before reading the first book because I had the wrong impression.  Thought this triology was heavy in sadistic sex, but I was wrong.  The sex is part of both Christian & Ana's story, but the majority of the books is a growing love story.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is a lot of fun. The challenge is not too hard. Can't wait to play Temple Run 2. Awesome!
1616614609|5.0|My son and I love this game. We've played several games of this, and we would play more if we had the time. Great game once you learn the rules and the 'flow'.<br /><br />Good quality cards and pieces.<br /><br />Killer art work.
B0000042MY|5.0|I loved the movie and how powerful the music is in it so I wanted to listen to this while working or in the car.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The plots continues to interest me and the acting is beyond fantastic.  Looking forward to season 4!  Best show of 2013
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Best game ever ever ever! My whole family loves this game. The more challenge,  the more interesting! It is really fun.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought my first one the day it was announced and love it so I purchased another one for my grandmother because she like me does not own a smart tv
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like this game. Graphics are good, popup directions are a bit tiresome but overall a good game. I don't mind having to wait for energy levels and strength to reload. I like that it seems to be never-ending and that there aren't 3 free levels and then a payment required to continue playing the game.
1781162646|5.0|I really enjoyed the setting in this book. Lots of background given on the characters. A fun novel. I would like to read more &#34;Joyland&#34; books.
B009AY04A8|2.0|This game was much too easy. And all the talking! All this game is is a waste of my time.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed the writing and the characters. However, as a novel it seemed a bit disjointed. It would have been better as a collection of short stories. But worth the read.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am speechless, first I hear from my 15 year old granddaughter that it is her favorite book. Then the same refrain from my daughter and then a close friend professor who is in a well worn  book club. I was intrigued, I wasn't disappointed, but I kept saying, it just can't be THAT good. But it is; read it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First, it's incredibly easy to install.<br />I'm not exaggerating when I say it took me longer to get it out of the box than it took to get it up and running on my TV.<br /><br />Secondly, it was just as easy to get it to connect to my tablet and my Smartphone.<br /><br />It was so good, that I immediately went back to the internet to buy a decent speaker system for my TV so I could enjoy the music through out my home.<br /><br />It won't take long for a BUNCH of android applications to feature this item in their options and I am looking forward to any new applications designed specifically for it.<br /><br />Best 40 bucks I've spent this year (Aside from gourmet cat food)
B009UNH0EM|4.0|This device works well as expected, Amazon shipped the item quickly as always. its good to have two of these, one for the car, and one for the house. The headset is useless if you don't have this charge cable, this is a bit of a disadvantage to an otherwise great headset.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you like bingo games, you'll love this one. As fast paced and competitive as playing in a live bingo hall. This app works well on Facebook. I've had a few problems, but I think the problems are few. Make sure you earn enough credits to play..you'll need them..they tend to go pretty quick. The only thing that irritates me about the games is that towards the end the game goes quickly and even if you get that last second bingo..it doesn't let you claim it. So, watch your time. I've spent countless hours and many credits playing. I start my day with it. Good luck and many BINGOS.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|A new take on the fantasy genre...great for young adults and adult adults as well. Must read!  Wish the series went on a bit longer.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun little time waster. Worth the ninety nine cents even better as the free app of yhe day.plays well no stutter
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|08/25/13 This is the third season about a very well-acted English Drama. You end up caring about all the characters and they never disappoint.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game! brings me back to the old school first gen game. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not bad at all. Basic graphics. Simple and fun gameplay. Great time waster. Great as a free download, but wouldn't buy.
B000002IWH|5.0|I saw this movie the other day and it reminded me of how much I loved this movie and the soundtrack. Now that I had the movie I had to get the sound track.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This book will lift the spirit and implant a sense of optimism in all who read it.  Heaven or Hell is within you and this book teaches that your subconscious mind can lead you down any path you so choose.  Read the book if you value your quality of life and want a new tool for your mental toolbox.<br /><br />S. Goodlett
0385349947|2.0|I admit it -- I bought into the hype and I was disappointed. This book does absolutely nothing to advance women and, in fact, seems like a self-important concept struggling to find relevance in a world that already has concrete role models that don't need to be plastered within glossy phoniness.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A lot of fun.  I love games that make me think.  And, the puzzles get progressively harder, which keeps my interest.-
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chrome Tab Casting is just really awesome. Now Google just need to allow extension on Android version of Chrome then it would be perfect for business.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is an awesome series of books that are definitely worth your time. The characters are built well. The only reason for 4 stars is because it is repetitive at times. I'm reading a new chapter and I think, \\"I already know this.\\" But despite that, awesome, awesome book.
0446343129|5.0|Easy to read.  I have cut down on my sugar.  I feel slot better.  Reading labels on food their is alot of sugar in stuff.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Another great movie in the GI Joe series just as good as the first.  More colorful language in this one, did not like and was not necessary.
B0093BUWGE|5.0|First, the recording is top notch, there is incredible detail, the audio is pristine, the mixing is spot on and it feels like you are there. This would make an excellent demo to show off your audio system. Jose wrote the words and music and he truly shines on this CD. He has an amazing and expressive voice which he uses like a instrument. One of my favorites is, &#34;Come To My Door&#34; which he sings with such emotion I feel that he wrote this song for someone. Every nuance of his voice is accurately presented in this recording and the other instruments and voices never get in the way but rather add to the texture of the music.
B004132HZS|5.0|What does one say about the incomparable?  There isn't a television show I've seen in 30 years that even comes close to Sherlock.  Needless to say Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman ARE the show, but it wouldn't be what it is without the genius of Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffatt.  I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan my entire life, but this show is in a class by itself.  I thought nothing would ever beat Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, but Benedict Cumberbatch brings something to the portrayal that words really can't describe. I anxiously await Season Three, and pray there will be a four, five and six and so on until all fifty-something of the Sherlock Holmes stories are told. Realistically I know there won't be, but nevertheless I do deeply and truly hope for at least two (three) more series.
B00503BN1M|2.0|Although the acting was pretty good, film as a whole missed the mark of great romantic comedy greatly. Instead of the comedic moments in the film actually enduring laughter they were awkward and made it feel as though you were the voyure of two very broken people's lives. Musically and edit wise some of the scenes lingered on too long while others were cut short and could have benefited from the jarring humor. Overall this movie would have been better marked as just a romantic film has they not tried to replicate several romcom cliches.
0439023513|5.0|Someone actually stole my last copy from the gym.  So, I had to order it again.  The company that mailed it out was excellent.  The book, while used, was in excellent condition.  If you want to better understand the Hunger Games and appreciate Catching Fire, you must read this final book in the series.  The ending was a little disappointing, but other than that the action is non-stop, it was hard to put this book down.
0307279189|1.0|This book is as awfull as my English :)<br />It is a fear enhancer. Make statements out of a state of mind that is jumping from one subject to another without any real solidity.<br />I had to stop reading in Chapter 6 because it made no sense to me, injecting this kind of things in my brain.<br />No se lo recomiendo a nadie. Lo compre pues estoy empezando a correr barefoot, pero no quiero pasar por el castigo de leer otro capitulo mas. Si tengo ganas de correr, corro, sino no. Eso no me hace ni mejor ni peor.
0375842209|4.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who is old enough to deal with holocaust themes. It is well written and uses a very different way of telling the story.
0451196716|5.0|This is one of the most frightening stories.  It's so real. I read this story a long time ago but wanted a book to keep.  It's one of the best stories ever! Really connected with the main character.  Read it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Again, what can one say about the incomparable?  Each show gets better and better.  Benedict Cumberbatch continues to display his amazing talent and I thank all the gods for whatever it was that inspired those two genius men, Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat to bring him on as Sherlock.  There has never been a television show to come close to what this show brings to its audience.  Again, I repeat as I did for the Season One review, that I hope and pray there will be at least three more seasons of Sherlock. Every single person I've told to watch the show has become a fan without exception.  At some point I will probably wear out my DVD's of Sherlock, but long before then I will have bought more and have them at hand. Being a chronic insomniac I spend many nights watching the shows.  They NEVER fail to entertain, delight and inspire me.  And once again, repeating myself, I anxiously await Season Three.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|About 2 weeks in, and the Chromecast has been great. YouTube and Netflix look better then on the Roku, and the &#34;app as the remote&#34; is a great idea. Casting from Chrome worked will, with a little stutter on video. My only issue has been from my WiFi setup -- if my laptop is on the 5ghz channel, and Chromecast is on 2.4ghz, the laptop can't find the Chromecast (thought it eventually does, have yet to figure out how).
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I like the game. Gives me something to do. I wish it was more like the egnigmatis maple creek game though. Still for free you should try it :)
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun little game to play. Good for passing the time and a nice old school feel to it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo Blitz is great fun and I play daily. The only problem I have is sometimes the game freezes up and I don't know if its the game or my kindle. Even with that issue its a great game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just downloaded this app and it is just exactally what I expected and wanted....I love solitaire and this fits the bill, easy to use and a fun game
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Always wanted to check out what all the rave was about Doctor Who and I found it to be quite good indeed.  A very weird but humorous Sci-Fi show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game I absolutely love it I highly recommend it  if you love horses you will absolutely love this game play it
B00992CF6W|3.0|I wanted to meet my friend on minecraft but the realms is not working so I guess this app is ok
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has been getting rave reviews all over tumblr (social media website) and John Green is getting touted all over as a genius. Of course, i had to witness this for myself. This book is open and honest and very quotable. The banter between characters is amusing and the deadpan manner with which John Green conveys it in is pure gold. The twist in the book came completely unexpected and blindsided me. I didn't cry, but I feel almost like I need go give a moment of silence for the characters struggles in the book.<br /><br />I don't normally read books of this nature, I prefer to stick to action and adventure and fantasy. I like to read about the supernatural and travel to different worlds. This book grabbed me from the very beginning and made me keep turning the pages to find out what happened next.<br /><br />Also, other comparable ebooks on the market are maybe 9.99 and I really like how the price of this one is so reasonable. 3.99 for a popular and newer title in the ebook industry is like finding a unicorn. It's well worth the money and more. Pick it up!<br /><br />Edit 1: I knew the 3.99 was too good to be true lol! They upped the price because now it's being advertised all over and what with the movie coming out they know they stand to make a profit. I'm not mad, but I'm disappointed for those who missed the great sale.<br /><br />Also I should say that the book reads as a little pretentious, I won't pretend it isn't. But it's still very likeable.
014241493X|5.0|I have been watching the vlogbrothers on YouTube for about 5 years.  I picked up this book at a book fair a while back, but just finally had the time to read it.  It was brilliant.  I wish it hadn't taken me so long to read it.  I was only 50 pages into the book and I went to Amazon to buy the rest of his books.  I love his intelligent and witty writing.  I just finished the book and I almost want to read it again.  As a 30 year old, I don't always enjoy young adult fiction, but I LOVED this!  If you haven't gathered yet, I highly recommend this book.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I loved this book. I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this book. I cannot understand the negative reviews this book received. You have to be some kind of desensitized child not to appreciate the amazing development and emotions of the characters and themes of this book. And though it does not focus on action and Gore this book truly does belong to the genera of horror. If you can read this book and take on the emotions as your own then you will find a terror just as thrilling and far deeper than that of your contemporary horror novels. Yes the book is short but I did not feel the ending was rushed or let me down. And one must remember this was written as a futuristic piece back in the fifties. If you're looking for a book about the movie don't bother, this came way before and the movie was only loosely based on it. However I loved the movie too. If you love the horror genera and have a good mind there is no way you should skip this book. It's a must read for horror/vampire lovers. 5*
B00B5DNDR8|4.0|When I first found out about this album, I thought it was a stop-gap release to tide fans over until their next full length studio album, tentatively titled \\"Empire of the Undead\\" comes out.  The Amazon description seems to confirm this.  BUT... after a few listens I wasn't so sure.<br /><br />It's NO secret that Gamma Ray pay heavy homage to Judas Priest, and many of their albums feature songs and sounds reminiscent of that late metal band.  Moreover, several tracks on this album are JP-sounding covers, and their original material just isn't the ultra fast paced, ultra-catchy Gamma Ray I've come to know and love.<br /><br />Where I've landed is that this album is a bit of an experiment, which is fine for an EP. I've given Master of Confusion four stars because I do like the songs.  Empire of the Undead is fast and in-your-face if a bit generic sounding.  Master of Confusion slows the pace down a bit but still rips right along.  The Sweet cover, Lost Angels, and the live versions of \\"The Spirit\\", Wings of Destiny,\\" and \\"Gamma Ray\\" being the other reasons to buy.  These are really good songs, and some of the only times outside of bootlegs we hear Kai singing some of the older GR material.  A quick word of warning... the live version of \\"Time to Break Free\\" is painful to listen to.  Michael Kiske is not in good form here and sounds like he wasn't aware he was being recorded.<br /><br />In closing, I think 'Master' is both a stop-gap AND a step outside the usual Gamma Ray offering, both of which are good things.  Just be ready for the latter before you listen.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|I thought it was a great expression of what America is supposed to be about - especially at the end when Howard [Garry Cooper] gives his defense summation to the Jury!
B00B6U63ZE|5.0|While some of the book's content seems to be no-brainer stuff, it certainly helps to refresh and remind yourself of what it feels like to go through a transition and the many balls to keep in the air.  It also does an excellent job of teaching you that others around you are in a transition and how to best make sure they are successful as well during your transition.  If you are considering interviewing for a job or have landed a new one, this is a must read book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Entertaining and very fast paced. I wish the main character would make  up her mind on what she wants though.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As an owner of a Roku 3 my standards are high and for the price of the Google Chomecast I was more than intrigued by the fact that you could also share web pages from your computer.  I go backpacking a lot and using this to stream maps from my computer onto my television is pretty darned sweet.  Knowing too that Google will continue to add other applications beside their google play store, netflix and youtube only boosts the value of this awesome streaming dongle.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I cannot wait to check out the rest of the seasons.  I watch, read and listen to this story because there are so many different characters and kings and kingdoms but in spite of that I am really enjoying this series.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Entertaining and strange. I play the game weekly and it is a challenge. No problem using on the tablets. bye
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Google Chromecast. It honestly couldn't have been easier to setup. It immediately found my home network and connected with my phone/tablet/PC with ease. While there are only few apps that currently support Chromecast I have already heard rumors of several major content providers working on developing their apps to support Chromecast. I have never had any issues with the device, and love how easy it is to share content when I have people over for a party. I only held back from giving it 5 stars at the moment simply because of how few apps currently support Chromecast, but I'm positive that will change in the future. For $35 this is a definite buy.
1400052181|5.0|This book is a good read. It is informative and entertaining. I hope the remaining Lack's members are proud too that Henrietta finally got the recognition she deserves.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I have a difficult time remembering birthdays and anniversaries as well as special events.  This tool allowed me to enter reoccurring special dates as well as one time events.  I check it daily which tells me the current date as well as anything I might overlook otherwise.  I highly recommend.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Perhaps the basic idea could be considered formulaic, but just as I enjoyed &#34;White Collar&#34;, &#34;The Good Guys&#34;, and &#34;The Defenders&#34;, I like this type of show: oddball types thrown together, each having strengths and weaknesses, each helping the other, and eventually growing to trust and like each other (OK, &#34;The Defenders&#34; started with them already knowing each other, but the rest still applies).
B007SOQBCM|4.0|It is a really good app you can log in to your twitch if you are watching someone on the top you can tap a tab and it will follow that person but the thing that disappointed me was no chat so who's people are doing giveaways you can not enter to win on iPhones and Ipads there is chat so that is the thing that I BAD about this app still the app is really good
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This story kept me intregued.  It went from one surprise to another. Although I knew from the title that Jacob was going to be accused, I had no idea how complex the outcome would be.  The ending was probably the only way out for this family.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Ever wonder where they came up with the new challanger? Watch this movie. This guy takes speed to his death!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a great little app that lets you do everything you would do on a full computer. It even tells you when you've pinned something before, but this feature can be hit or miss.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin set the standard for hard rock/blues, and this DVD shows why. For crying out loud. You are dealing with genius here. It is obvious with Page, but it's the whole band. Crud. How does something like that happen? My only upset is that the video production is not too good.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Well I got this app and it good on downloading five videos but when u want to watch more it.does not want to load suckssss
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing. Totally addictive in a good way. I would definitely recommend it. The challenges are great, the graphics are cool and the minions are the BEST! BAHNAHNAH! :D
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Loved it! Some levels were fairly easy but challenging &amp; some were hard but challenging too. If all levels were hard, it would get too stressful &amp; I wouldn't want to continue thinking I just won't get anywhere. I get bored with a game like that. Then on the other hand, if it's too easy, That gets boring too. So anyway, it was a great game! Didn't want it to end!!
B000022TSY|5.0|Takes you back to another time and space. May we neaver forget! Modern motorcycles have nothing on these bikes. We blew it man! What a classic line.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|All you have to do is read the names of the cast and you know it will be a dynamite movie!!  I have watched this movie three times and will probably watch it again!!  The story line is great, the action doesn't stop, and you will not want it to end!  Just remember, do not mess with us Senior Citizens - we do not play fair!!
B000000W94|5.0|How can you possibly not love this album? Gary really did some of his best work with this tribute to Peter Green. You will not find a better guitarist than Gary Moore and this album is no exception. There is nothing better for me, than turning the lights down low and putting on some Gary Moore. It cures whatever ails you.<br /><br />I have to wonder what Peter Green was thinking when he heard it for the first time? He had to have been so proud, I bet he cried.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I turned the timer off, since I can`t play for long most times, but so far it`s been an enjoyable time killer!  Still waiting for it to get hard though!
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Pretty awesome record, not a bad song on it, not a surprise though cause they always rock it!! I highly recommend this to the clutch fan
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved it! The plot was interesting and the flashbacks left me wanting to read on! Can't wait to read sharp objects!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is awesome! I can't wait to see what other vendors add casting functionality to their products. It should be interesting to see screen casting polished up also
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|for the money you cannot pass this up. Stop listening to the samples and just click the buy button already.
B000000W71|5.0|released two singles on this album, &#34;One Day&#34; and &#34;With Love (Remember)&#34;, that were previously un-released. I was pleasantly surprised as they are very good. In fact, &#34;One Day&#34; turned out to be my wife's favorite song off of the album.<br /><br />The whole album is superb. Gary as usual, tells a story with each riff and brings the listener along for the ride into his world. His guitar work is pure magic. If you are a Gary Moore fan, you will love this.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome product really meets my expectations. I just wished it would work with more apps but overall great product. :)
B00C6B7GTE|5.0|Love the movie, the Dude and the music. It reminds me of the good old days and when I lived in southern California.
1416583432|1.0|Please, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!<br />As a dog lover I always buy books concerning dogs that might help me understand our canine counterparts. This book is the absolute worst I have ever read. It is not even toilet material. I usually read cover to cover but had to skip huge chunks because it was so BORING.<br />This so called expert on dogs is a fraud. I feel robbed that I spent my money on this crap.<br />I wonder who she paid to get those reviews the book had in it.<br />They say don't judge a book by the cover, and that is so true. Don't let that cute dog on the cover make u buy this book, the contents are more like what comes out the back end of the dog.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|quite addictive!!!!!!!!!!!! always wanting to get further each time I go on it!!!!!! hate that you have to purchase upgrades :(
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|We watched the whole movie, but i can't say it had our attention the whole time. I have to say i'm disappointed with it overall, mostly because the movie didn't have much depth. After watching the preview we felt it was worth a shot since you're only seeing a few pieces of the picture, and it did look interesting, but then fell short of our expectations.
B009EE0SC8|5.0|5star is what i give it.. Its great picture perfect coooooool keep up the good work i think that's all for now
B00821OX98|5.0|I have watched season 3 and now have downloaded season 1 and 2 on my kindle and am catching up.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|The boys asked me if they can get this free ap and they really like it.  I would recommend it
B0016OOS16|4.0|I use it with ProE and SolidWorks. It was a bit difficult initially to control the CAD models but once you get used to it, it works like a charm. Makes the whole CAD experience way easier. I rate it 4 stars because I feel that the price is too high for the convenience it offers.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Very cute and well written.  Characers were very believeable and made me feel like I could have been in the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It just hangs if it is streaming a video from Chrome...the name is anything but APT..CHROMECAST..it should be YOUTUBECAST or something...i am not happy with it...:(
B00170F0WU|5.0|I watched this movie about 15 times before I realized what it was that had me so enthralled...it's the relationship between Leon and Matilda. In these days of child abuse, I kept thinking something ugly would happen to her, but he took care of her and this touched my heart. I didn't need to watch it again..LOL..but I did! I don't buy/collect DVD's, but this is one that I would!
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. As a teacher it gives me hope that my work is making a difference.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My boys really like this game, they think its fun and they really enjoy it.  Would recommend it to others.
B0093LINVK|5.0|I purchased the following items from Amazon for just over $600 including taxes and all:<br /><br />  Intel Next Unit of Computing Kit (with Dual HDMI, Gigabit LAN, Core i3-3217U, Model #DC3217IYE)<br />  Crucial 8GB DDR3 1600 MT/s Memory Modules (CT2CP51264BF160B)<br />  Crucial m4 128GB mSATA Internal Solid State Drive (CT128M4SSD3)<br />  Windows 8 (System Builder OEM DVD 64-Bit)<br /><br />It took me just minutes to unpack and install the memory and SSD into the NUC box. I hooked up a Dell touch screen monitor (S2340T) via HDMI port, USB keyboard+mouse, a USB DVD drive (with Windows 8 DVD in it) and plugged in a ethernet cable.<br />Turned the system on and after 15 min or so, the OS was installed and I was ready to go. It went surprisingly smooth as I was concerned about few compatibility issues. I did not have to install/update any drivers to make everything work! I hadn't done anything like this in over a decade, and was pleasantly surprised at the &#34;plug & play&#34; setup.<br /><br />The only &#34;abnormal&#34; thing I noticed was that the NUC case was warmer to the touch than my comfort zone. As suggested by other reviewers and online, I increased the fan duty cycle and lowered the CPU operating temperature through the BIOS.<br />After two weeks of using it and installing a bunch of Apps (including MS Office), everything seems to be running well.<br />This was my first Windows 8 PC. It sure took a few days to learn the ins and outs of the new interface. Now, I actually like it. The key I think is the touch screen monitor.<br /><br />If the monitor had a VESA mount, it would have been nicer. But the NUC is so small it hides behind the monitor well.<br /><br />Bottomline: Great PC - fast, quite, easy to setup - at a slight markup than &#34;equivalent&#34; ugly, large, boxes from Dell/HP. I might buy the same set when my next PC needs an upgrade.
B00CVDNJ7A|5.0|This is better than the novel.By comparison the action here is swift needing no fat on the dialogs' bones.The skeleton of the movie is lean and mean.I especially liked all the European locations.You can feel the heat of day in summertime Paris and the tension is high throughout.Much more enjoyable and less didactict than the Book.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Such a inspirational story , not only for the star but for the renewal of faith that there are still givers in a otherwise takers world.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Having fun with it. Would buy it if not for nostalgic purposes alone the upgrades are nice not one of those in game purchase rip off games
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|..........tho the best one is the jjcale song IMO, but Cale, Clapton, have always been in my wheelhouse. Ending of \\"they call me the breeze\\" still has me scratching my head, knowing that it was sent out with the tail bobbed on it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game easy to use fun and touchscreen controls were very responsive. Worth the free price I paid for sure
B0000AFX64|5.0|I watched the complete series, when it came out in the early 80's.  I think it's better, then the series, that eventually replaced it.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|In my opinion, this game would be great if it had more opportunities to earn play coins. Even if you win a game you don't earn play coins, which I find incredibly odd. Otherwise, it's just okay.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fascinating reading.  The last book got a little slow but all in all it was worth reading. You should try it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great time waster &amp; fun to play.  I enjoy the challenge of completing animal families.  Only draw back is that the acorns are tough to come by unless you buy them with your own $$.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love pinterest but the kindle fire app has problems. it doesn't always let me pin stuff, the catafories go off screen and just won't let me click on them. I really love pinterest but wish the app worked on my kindle fire.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|After a few levels you start getting the idea of everything you need to complete the levels.  Good game.  Keeps the brain thinking.
B00004ZBVG|4.0|As a veteran of the Vietnam War, this movie brought back memories, some good and some bad.  It shows, how the Colonel, was affected, when he had to kill people.  War changes people.  It took me a long time to recover myself, and at times, I still have nightmares.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The visuals were great.  But otherwise it felt like the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; and out takes of some other Oz based story....like the bits that lead to the main story.  Much of it seemed to be partially or completely missing the for-shadowing, lead up or anything in the movie that explained how you got to that point.  If it were spliced into another Oz movie, perhaps as a DVD extra to watch with the back story and removed scenes, it would be much more satisfying.
1416972242|3.0|Just started this book, like the first one it is intriguing but not sure I care for the direction one of the characters has gone yet.
B003TOMAPC|1.0|I downloaded this movie, but I wasn't able to hear any of the dialogue.  My tv was ok with other amazon videos and broadcast tv.  Just beware if you download this movie that there might be audio problems
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun little poke the screen game. Reminiscent of the old missile command on Atari. I think it's pretty fun. What else is there to say? The game said to review for extra points!
B008JFUOVI|2.0|When the preview to a movie is played relentlessly on television and advertised everywhere online, you worry the producers are pushing the movie heavily because they know the movie isn't that great. Then you watch the preview and you worry they put every amusing portion in the movie in the trailer. Out of loyalty to the first Hangover, I watched it anyway despite all of these concerns and I honestly wish I hadn't. They did, indeed, put the only funny parts in the trailer and the rest of the movie just didn't hold up on it's own or as a sequel to what is, in my opinion, a fantastic movie they should've just let be so they didn't bring down its greatness. Hangover Parts II & III, you both suck. The original Hangover, I will always love you.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I'm not big on reviewing stuff, but I must say I was highly entertained. Brought me back to my youth when I was always reading comics...wish my mom didn't throw them away.
B0085OEU1I|5.0|Again, one of my favorites so I am a bit biased.  But I do rather enjoy owning my own copy  :)
1416955070|3.0|The story is a bit slow to start but held my interest enough that I want to continue into other books in the storyline.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Amazed she wrote these songs at 21.  Love the diversity of the songs and am totally enjoying her voice.  She seems to be a natural.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Funny, touching, meaningful and smartly written, &#34;The Fault in the Our Stars&#34; presents characters facing up to the scariest circumstances — cancer in myriad forms. You'll come to care about them, deeply, and not just them, but their parents and friends. I read a review that calls this book &#34;damn near genius.&#34; I just wish I could think of a better phrase than that.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I think Glee is a very good show.  I don't know why I didn't watch it when it was on regular TV.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game.in my little bit of water and the s in me and the s to draw the line
0894803123|5.0|I really loved this book, not only did I get great recipes from it, but I enjoyed reading the history behind one of my favorite ice cream makers. I totally recommend this, even my 11-year old liked it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very simple setup, high quality Youtube and Netflix streaming, and most sites worked pretty well throwing the Chrome tab to the TV.
0439023513|5.0|1) Plot (4 stars) - After defying the totalitarian capital, Katniss must now serve a different master as the reluctant symbol of the rebellion.  But nobody asked her.  And is the rebellion of cold asceticism from Distract 13 any better than the status quo of callous gluttony from the capital?  The story moves at a fast pace, and I was glad to see the plot progress after the stalled second book.<br /><br />2) Characters (5 stars) - For me, this is where the series finally moved out of the young adult genre with the broken, distant maturation of Katniss.  No longer is she the cocky vixen.  Now she is troubled, now she is wise, now she is real.  I was very glad to see her evolve in this way because this is what would happen if someone was responsible for so much pain, even indirectly.  However, she still remains imperfect, which is nice.  On the one hand, she doesn't let the thirst for revenge blind her to the pain she causes; but on the other hand, she is still the self-centered, petulant adolescent at times.  Gale and Peeta mature and harden as well, which was interesting to watch.<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - I think Collins did an excellent job of building on her reality show/Facebook generation critique of the first novel to show that these types of calculated performances go on outside of entertainment as well--in politics, in war, etc.  Everything is theater.  Everything is marketing.  There's also the theme of \\"are the revolutionaries any better than the people they're rebelling against?\\"  It's a theme that's certainly been explored before, but still it was nice to see Collins' not just fall back on the cliché of good guys and bad guys.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - Mockingjay continues to be told through Katniss' clipped, direct POV.  It is easy to read and gets you in the mood of the tale.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - Once again, Collins' skillfully paints a future that is both different and recognizable.  I could image the picture she paints.<br /><br />6) Overall (5 stars) - In my opinion, the best of the series.  Obviously it couldn't stand without the foundation of the first book.  But this installment is just so psychological, so deep, so dark.  I was really surprised Collins went here.  The arc of the trilogy could have easily gone down a candy-colored, teen romance route.  I applaud her choice; it gave me much respect for her.  And the result, I feel, elevated the series from fun read to literature.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm glad that GOOGLE/CHROME thought up this device!<br />It's really nice ! No more fumbling around trying to get YouTube and Netflix on to the Big Screen !<br />I would recommend this device to anyone!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|If you watch Netflix or Youtube this is a good deal, until it can play videos from a tablet or phone its not going to fly.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|What can I say ? It works great ! It's black and has a springy cord. It plugs into the 12 volt outlet in my vehicle and amazingly it charges my Iphone. How did I ever live without it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great simple game. Menus and structure are okay, not great. My kids actually like playing too cause it is simple. Great remake of a classic game.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|The gameplay was is rally quite nice. The menus were a little annoying with ads for other games but it doesn't appear excessive.
0385333846|4.0|1) Plot (4 stars) - After experiencing the massacre of Dresden in the Second World War, Billy Pilgrim returns to normal life where he grows steadily more and more insane.  That's the general plot, but during one of these bouts, Billy meets an alien race that sees time a little less sequentially than us, and so the book is told from this perspective, constantly jumping forward and backwards in the narrative.  It's a little hard to follow at times, but there's an impressive artistry in pulling off such a feat, especially in the arrangement of the collage and the smoothness of the transitions.<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - Billy Pilgrim is the hapless victim of the whims of forces beyond his control.  Even though he doesn't have much inner drive, you feel for him as he acquiesces to each new tug or push from life.  Most of the other characters are simple ones, meant to reflect wisdom or humor as Billy bounces into them and stumbles on.<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - There is a theme in here about forces beyond your control-how you can either go along for the ride, or fight them.  One of these forces is death and how we deal with it.  There are lots of hackneyed ways to approach this theme, but Vonnegut manages to explore it in a fresh, creative, imaginative way.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - To me, when Vonnegut is at the top of his game, he writes some of the most precise, insightful, and funny sentences in literature.  Each is so economically crafted; the words so thoughtfully chosen.  He also writes some of the sharpest dialogue, full of misunderstanding and innuendo.  His writing can be art of the highest order - good for the head, good for the heart, and good for the smile muscles.  While personally I don't think he's at his best here, the prose for the most part is still very good, and in some sections it sparkles.<br /><br />5) Setting (3 stars) - Some of the tale takes place in the misery of World War 2 prison camps, some in the emptiness of post-warAmerican opulence, and some in a zoo on a distant planet.  All were described in interesting and funny ways, but I didn't necessarily find myself transported to any of them.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - Though personally I don't think it's his best work, I would definitely recommend Slaughterhouse 5 for its creativity, humor, and typical Vonnegut wisdom.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|A real Sci-Fi classic.  With the `no music` soundtrack and George Pal`s effects, much different than other`s of the day. Anne Francis is stunning , and a very young Lesley Neilson star.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is by far the best book I've ever read!!! I used to think that the warrior series was the best book series ever, not anymore!!!
B000024D4R|4.0|This is an old classic from Pink Floyd, enjoyed for years as a vinyl LP.  Now, we have it on CD.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|You know, after 300+ one-star reviews, I wonder why I even bother. Maybe because it is my way of immortalizing two hours of my life I will never again have. Maybe this review is the only value I can get from this investment. This was a wonderful opportunity wasted. I can't be glad I spent only 3.99 on the rental since it's not worth even that trivial amount.<br /><br />Like many of the critics mentioned, the movie was long and terrible. The acting was poor and forced. I enjoyed the scene with the wizard making a show at the end, but too little too late. I was seriously considering not finishing the movie, something I've read in other reviews, and something not common for me.<br /><br />In the end, too much time concentrating on the effects and visuals and too little time thinking about the story and how to honor the original 1930's film. I don't see how they could ever bundle these two movies together.<br /><br />Sad.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Handy and easy to use. Nice not to have to drag out the older calculators see if they have batteries or are charged. Handy and I love the ease of use.
1451626657|5.0|1) Plot (3 stars) - On an island in the Mediterranean during World War Two, one bombardier fights against the insanity all around him to be labeled insane and sent home.  That's the general plot, but the book jumps forward and backward in time to form a collage of satirical scenes that only when looked at in their entirety coalesce into the plot.  This format, while entertaining, left me a little confused on the story line until the end.  Also, since the collage is the focus, the tension was low.<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - Every chapter is devoted to a different character, and there are about 30 chapters, so characters play a big role in this story.  However, it is a satire, so the characters often represent an archetype or philosophy stretched to a level of absurdity.  All except Yossarian, the lead, who just wants to get out from all the craziness and go home, while still maintaining some warmth and morality.  I found all the characters enjoyable.  But, be warned, this is a \\"book about dudes\\" as a female friend once told me after putting it down after 100 pages, so be prepared for a woman's perspective to only inhabit the fringes.<br /><br />3) Theme (5 stars) - A big theme is what is crazy and what is sane, and in a world where everything's crazy, is the one sane man really the crazy one?  Craziness is portrayed as those things that trample human kindness, and the culprits are many--ego, patriotism, the medical institution, capitalism, abstract education, bureaucratic hierarchy, national politics, organized religion, and so on.  The explorations were all done well, but heavily satirized, and so the moments of raw emotion (which I found the most resonating in driving home the message) were unfortunately far apart.<br /><br />4) Voice (5 stars) - Heller writes in a witty, sarcastic, and disjointed style.  I don't say disjointed with a negative tone; his ability to jump in time or space or perspective from sentence to sentence and still be coherent was very impressive.  His writing isn't the kind that is smooth and effortless and pulls you imperceptibly along in the fictional dream; Heller plays with his craft like a mechanic, working the switches and gears out in the open, showing you how magnificently the machine can work.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - The little military island of Pianosa and wartime Rome were the two major locales of this book.  Both were described with detail.  But, because of the nature of the writing, it was a little tough for me to feel transported there.<br /><br />6) Overall (5 stars) - This was a tough call.  I certainly think it has its shortcomings--namely the satire was a bit over the top, sabotaging the opportunity for the themes to really pack a punch--but it is a marvelously creative and well-constructed novel, filled with quirky scenes and thoughtful ideas.  And for that, not only would I recommend it, I would read it again.
B00271B752|5.0|Awesome movie. I did not realize it was true until I got to the end.That honor and truth had so little standing in the very community of men and women chosen to protect and defend. Corruption from top to bottom. Forced to leave the country, the only way he would/could survive the brotherhood of the police force he loved so much. I fear corruption has invaded too much of our country, from the top to the bottom. It is little wonder the American people are losing faith in their leaders.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Thank you Pam for your unique style of writing!  The experiments were fun and my 9 year old son and I really enjoyed growing the beans.  I find that many authors take themselves far too seriously - your irreverence was refreshing and showed me that this is just regular every day stuff - available for anyone who's interested.  Thank you!

0385334206|4.0|1) Plot (2 stars) - Two men are invited to an arts festival.  One is a science fiction writer who produces a story that when read by the other makes him laughingly mean and carefree and insane.  That's the general plot, but it's far in the background.  Most of the story is Vonnegut railing against all the \\"junk\\" that's been put in his head over his life, mainly dealing with American norms like capitalism and race relations.  So be prepared for a sermon more than a story.  A funny sermon though.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Kilgore Trout is the aging science fiction writer who finds out his ideas actually do have power and he should make them humane.  He is beaten and flippant and watchful.  Dwayne Hoover--the recipient of Trout's word poison--is a middle-aged car salesman looking for something to believe in.  Both characters are likeable and funny, but they didn't seem as deep as ones in his earlier novels.<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - A major theme is that it's possible for a human to believe anything, so be careful what you produce and consume.  This is a very Buddhist concept, but in Vonnegut's hands it's novel and quirky and humorous.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - To me, when Vonnegut is at the top of his game, he writes some of the most precise, insightful, and funny sentences in literature.  Each is so economically crafted; the words so thoughtfully chosen.  He also writes some of the sharpest dialogue, full of misunderstanding and innuendo.  His writing can be art of the highest order - good for the head, good for the heart, and good for the smile muscles.  However, in this novel, the writing doesn't seem as crisp and thoughtful as others.  The prose is still funny though, may be even more so than his other works because he seems so fed up and angry with the world.<br /><br />5) Setting (2 stars) - The two men travel across the eastern and central US.  There are some fun descriptions of hotels and freeways and such, but I certainly didn't feel transported anywhere.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - I really vacillated between 3 stars and 4 stars for this one.  3 stars because it's so jumbled.  4 stars because it's funny and wise.  I'd recommend it.
B00005NB8K|1.0|Movie was BORING!!!!!! I bought it through a recommendation; won't listen to taht guy anymore.  However, if you were/are a fan
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Just started it last night, have to give me more time to play around with this before I can answer this one. But so far I like it, as to how much I've done on it so far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it. That is really all there is to it. Other words can't describe what I felt about this book.
1400069807|5.0|Michael Moss has done an outstanding job researching and explaining the negative effects of convenience, processed, fast foods.  The &#34;food&#34; that we eat is not food at all.  Instead, it is a huge profit-making commodity that is extremely unhealthy.  The salt, sugar, and fat combination leads to obesity, high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes.  This combination is addictive in that the more we eat, the more we crave.  Bottom line: it's all about high profits.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I received this really fast and just absolutely love this movie. I got a really good deal on this as well!
1476733953|3.0|1) Plot (3 stars) - A lady has been trapped in a silo her whole life and now gets a chance to find out what's on the outside.  Okay, a good overall plot, you hooked me.  But after the first act, it slowed down a lot, and I was skimming paragraphs to find the next big reveal, which for me never came.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - There was nothing wrong with the characters, but also nothing particularly fresh or interesting.  Moreover, there was little doubt who the good guys were and who the bad guys were, which, for me, doesn't provide enough depth into the complexities of being human to be interesting.<br /><br />3) Theme (3 stars) - The idea of what happens when you isolate societies into small spaces is a fascinating theme, but it wasn't directly explored in detail so I was left with nothing much to ponder besides the initial set up.<br /><br />4) Voice (3 stars) - It was good in that I could read it (something that's not always the case).  But, I didn't find much poetry or wisdom in the sentences.  Also, for me, about 25% of the sentences didn't add a lot of value and could have been removed.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - Howey did a great job of describing what these silo societies would look like, and I definitely felt like I was in the dark, drippy, manipulated dungeons.<br /><br />6)Overall (3 stars) - I really like the author's backstory, the first act, and the general setting for the story.  But, I didn't feel like it reached its potential, especially for all the pages I read through.  It could have been tighter and deeper.  I hear the next installment provides more detail, so perhaps it reaches its potential there.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Garth Brooks is my favorite country singer, but the country I listen too is mostly 90's country. So it has all of his songs I know and love and more that I have never heard but now love! It also comes with the lyrics which is always great!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|It's a fun game but it can be frustrating at times because I can't sometimes I can't figure out an atom to make a element
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This book is a good fast book to read. The plot takes an unpredictable turn in the last few chapters. A good fun book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I don't usually have the patience for trilogies, but the second book to the Hunger Games really took me by surprise. I did not predict at all what was coming. I love surprises so I was thrilled all along the way. I think the Hunger Games trilogy is a classic of our current time period and I recommend it! On to the final book...
B009XIXVU6|4.0|My only complaint was that it jumped around quite a bit, making it hard to to keep track of relationships between characters and where they were.
0385720920|2.0|1) Plot (2 stars) - A man's mother is dying and he must decide whether to participate in a radical treatment to help her.  And that's about it.  Really.  Not much of a story, just a lot of jumping back and forth from the boy's childhood on the road to his present in sex clubs and nursing homes.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Victor is the sex addict lead who purposely chokes on food to get people to save him and give him money so that he can pay for his mother's nursing care.  Denny is his side-kick bro, offering up the occasional balanced advice, but mostly just reinforcing his juvenile tendencies.  Victor's mom is the bossy con-artist, thumbing her nose at all the hypocrisies of the world.  None seemed to be struggling internally to grow into something more noble.  And of the three, only the mom said or did anything particularly interesting.<br /><br />3) Theme (2 stars) - Addiction seemed to be the underlying thread of this book--specifically sex addiction--but I didn't understand what message I was supposed to take away about it.  At one point there's a line about how addicts actually have a lot of control because they choose their future death.  But much like many of his other clever sentences, this one is thrown out there but not really explored.<br /><br />4) Voice (3 stars) - Palahniuk writes in short, colloquial, puzzle piece sentences.  What I mean by puzzle piece is that he often has two or three trains of thought simultaneously chugging on the same page (e.g., the present action, a memory, and a whimsical thought) and he splices them together to form a larger picture.  In Fight Club, I thought he used this technique well, with the unorthodox prose helping to reinforce plot and theme.  But here, the writing seemed to regress into a more juvenile and distracting version of itself.<br /><br />5) Setting (2 stars) -There were some interesting descriptions of nursing homes, strip clubs, and Colonial Williamsburg.  But I rarely felt like was actually atany of them.<br /><br />6) Overall (2 stars) - I really want to like Palahniuk.  He has an interesting perspective on modern American disillusionment, and can write creative and funny prose.  But this story just seemed to lack any real plot, strong characters, or cohesive message.  It's too bad, because he has lots of great ideas sprinkled here and there.  They just don't, at least for me, really come together to form anything wise and complete, like they did in Fight Club.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|way fun game reminds me of the old Atari missile command nonstop fun when the missles fly hopefully not buggy
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun game, but there is always an ad after every round!<br />Not going to delete it.  Just wanted to share my opinion
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Simple and funny. The thing goes like this, you have a monkey, you dress him and you fight with other monkeys! When I saw it at the first time, tough it will be a waist of memory and now its my favorite game, makes me so happy, thanks very much to the developers for continue with the tradition of making really cool games!<br /><br />Highly recomended.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked this book and was entertained but I felt the story lacked a little complexity and the author painted herself into a corner with regards to the conclusion.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Sons is a great television show. Easily in my top ten if not my favorite tv show. Im anxious to see how season 6 and 7 play out. Season 4 was really good. Watch it, love it.
0312330537|4.0|1) Plot (3 stars) - After breaking out of prison, an Australian fugitive hides in the underworld of Bombay seeking ... and that's what I don't know.  I kept reading because the world was so fascinating, but I'm not sure what the main character was trying to achieve.  Redemption?  A new life?  Perhaps and perhaps.  But those are just guesses on my part because it wasn't especially clear.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - There's Lin, the protagonist tough guy with a heart of gold.  I was impressed by his courage and gumption, but I just didn't get deep enough in his self-doubt to feel a lot of sympathy for him.  And there's also Lin's supporting cast.  His smiling Indian side kick, the band of misfit expats, the dangerous and wise mafia.  I was intrigued by them all, but didn't feel like I knew any especially well.<br /><br />3) Theme (3 stars) - I'm not really sure what the moral was.  There were plenty of minor philosophies bandied about in bar room and ghetto conversations, but I'm not sure what they all added up to.<br /><br />4) Voice (3 stars) - Roberts really cares about his subject matter and his friends--which is admirable--but at times it all seemed a bit melodramatic and un-nuanced.  Much like the hulking physique of the main character, the descriptions seemed to be hammered onto the page, blunt and jarring, as opposed to deftly and precisely.<br /><br />5) Setting (5 stars) - Now this is why I kept reading.  If you have any desire to learn about the ghettos of Bombay, expat lifestyles, 3rd world prisons, drug running, passport trading, or jihad fighting then read this book.  Apparently the author lived in this world, and what a fascinating world it is.  In the end, the Bombay underworld seemed to be the point of the book--more than the hero's goal, or hero's growth, or hero's moral--and in this area Roberts succeeds mightily.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - I vacillated between 3 stars and 4 stars when I read this book.  In the end, I gave it a 4 because Shantaram is a great story, it's just not told especially well.  Still, I'd recommend it.ause Shantaram is a great story, it's just not told especially well.  Still, I'd recommend it.

B008CJ0JTI|5.0|My rating is based solely off the fact that this is a great movie. The quality is very nice, as all non bootlegs should be.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, but I did think there were way too many characters in the book. There were some parts that just seemed odd in terms of its inclusion. That said though, the writing is, as always, very evocative.

B001GXF2YY|4.0|Angels flight was a typical Harry Bosch novel.  You think you know who the killer is then other people come into play. Would recommend to all who like mystery until the end.
0061673730|4.0|1) Plot (3 stars) - A man embarks on a cross-country motorcycle trip with his son to uncover the truth of his former life.  There's a mystery in here, which was fun to speculate on as he slowly revealed his past over the miles on the road.  However, often there were long tangents about obscure philosophical points.  So you would probably have to be into those types of tangents to keep reading.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - There's the solemn, intellectual dad trying to figure out who he used to be.  There's the acting-out son trying to get his distracted dad's attention.  And there are the road tripping companions who mostly serve as a sounding board for dad's thoughts on life.  Pirsig should get credit for the \\"realness\\" of his two main characters, but sometimes I got tired of the depressed state of everyone.  Where's the joy?<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - This is an \\"idea book\\" so there's no shortage of message.  A good 50% of the book is devoted to the main character philosophizing.  Pirsig starts the novel by saying he's going to talk about technology, about how it shouldn't alienate people.  But really where he ends up is on the concept of quality--what it is and where its place in society should be.<br /><br />4) Voice (3 stars) - The book is a dense one, packed with academic ideas, and that's not an easy thing to make a fiction read out of.  Pirsing does a good job with this challenge ... though I wouldn't say the prose was poetry.<br /><br />5) Setting (3 stars) - The setting is rural America in the 70s as viewed from the seat of a motorcycle.  But since much of the pages were about philosophical ideas, this is far in the background.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - I'm going to give it 4 stars, even though the powers of mathematics say the average of the component scores above should come out to a 3.  So why 4?  Well, 4 stars in my world is the boundary for \\"do I recommend it?\\"  And I think I do.  Maybe I respect the intellectual rigor of the book.  Or maybe I just respect a man who would so openly write about his bout with insanity and parenting difficulties without trying to justify all his mistakes by implying that he was really right, or dismissing it all with humor.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|There was too much sexy talk and not enough action. I would not recommend it to any of my friends.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent read, well written too. Like the authors previous books, the setting a d characters are simply charming.  The ad Tory line is very tender and sweet.
B009CQMZ6K|1.0|I usually don't leave reviews unless the service/item is exceptionally awesome or exceptionally awful...<br />Me and 2 other coworkers travel a lot for work, so we use our phones for GPS.<br /><br />We purchased 5 total of these for home and work at 3 different times.<br /><br />4 of them broke EXACTLY in the same spot, less than 2 months of use. The plastic that connects to the rubber suction, right where they connect it cracked/broke all the way...<br />I take the plastic is too weak and also the spring is too strong.<br /><br />WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!<br /><br />If it wasn't for that FLAW... nice design and holds a note 2 if needed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a great game. ready for the update and more levels . not too challenging but an enjoyable game.
B0026O475M|5.0|This is a great movie of perseverance, survival, companionship, loyalty, hope, desperation, strength, knowledge, love and life. This is a must see!
0439023521|4.0|1) Plot (5 stars) - In a future where children are reaped to fight to the death in the equivalent of a reality TV show, one contestant refuses to play by the rules, an act of rebellion that could start a revolution.  Collins' plot is fast-moving and suspenseful, resulting in a one of those \\"can't put down\\" books.<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - Katniss is the reluctant hero, a tough, brave, but emotionally-closed teenager.  She has much of the angst of a modern adolescent, only she is living in much more trying times.  Two boys complete the love triangle.  Gale, the rough and angry Option A, and Peeta, the kind and sensitive Option B.  All three were drawn well and enjoyable.<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - There's obviously a statement in here about a totalitarian government stealing freedoms from the masses.  But we've heard that story before, so thankfully there was also something new.  What I found fresh was the commentary on the modern spectator society--on how when we view other people's triumphs and sufferings through a screen they become entertainment to be consumed, and how this informational closeness but human distance makes us self-centered and numb.  And there's also a comment on the other side--on the object of the spectators--the Facebook, Twitter, and Blog generation who publically narrate their lives and spend their time playing to invisible eyes.  This theme is relatively new in the human experience (at least at this magnitude), and so it was neat to see it already explored in a work of fiction.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - The story is told from Katniss' clipped, direct POV.  Though I wouldn't describe the prose as poetic, it was very readable and creates a definite mood to the tale.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - Collins' skillfully paints a future that is both different and recognizable.  I could image the picture she paints.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - A fast-moving dystopian tale with a fresh moral for our Facebook generation.Though the target audience is young adults, I felt the teenage angst was done with sophistication, and the somewhat clichéd juvenile rivalries were not too distracting.  I'd recommend it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really like this one. I wish they had a lot more. You guys should make more themes to this game.
159102594X|2.0|I very much wanted to like this book. It's the kind of project I'm sympathetic to - an attempt to tell an epic story in a resolutely hardboiled, unglamorous kind of way. Abercrombie is basically a pulp writer, but he deftly sketches in his characters quickly and cleanly and he can write action sequences exceptionally well. (It's something of a lost art, the ability to write effective action sequences, but Abercrombie manages to choreograph everything very well: we always know where everyone is and what everyone's doing, the action is conveyed clearly without bogging the reader down, etc.) I thought the first half or so of this was very impressive.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, once the plot really starts to kick into high gear things fall apart. I think the problem, at its base, is that this book comes out of a false conception that you can do both - that you can be hardboiled in an epic way. I question whether that `s possible at all - I'm pretty sure it's not possible in the epic fantasy genre, however.<br /><br />As this story goes along the contrivances start to show themselves more clearly: obvious plot devices, characters who exist only to fill certain roles, certain complications telegraphed. This wasn't the case earlier, when the story seemed more free-flowing, and I think the problem lies in the fact that the first part of the book doesn't feel like an epic at all, but rather a big realistic novel (albeit with fantastical elements - see Shardik for an earlier example of this). Once an epic battle between good and evil really starts to kick off the form demands a kind of Idealistic poetry that the means - hardboiled realism - just can't deliver. You can't make the grubby streets sing in that kind of way, maybe. Part of the point of Raymond Chandler is in investigating what tarnished goals a real hardboiled knight would fight for.<br /><br />So I strongly suspect this whole production was badly crafted at the start - there's no way to improve this. A shame, like I said, because there's goo d things here - I'd like to see Abercrombie work on less ambitious sword and sorcery adventures, he'd probably do a decent job with it.
B009AY04A8|4.0|good game and storyline. A little to easy to complete the early levels. The good thing it's free to play. Thanks
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|TTB has not disappointed with this release. It's a little edgier than the first CD, a bit of raw flavor performed with precision. This band is going to get better and better with each recording.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What you expect is what you get!!! I highly recommend it to anyone! It is that good! and the price....
0140042520|3.0|1)  Plot (2 stars) - An urban East Coaster experiments with Californian Buddhism in rural and city backgrounds.  And that's about it.  The main character doesn't really have a goal or destination, except perhaps to go more and more rural.  Perhaps this wandering is the point of the book.  But, in terms of plot, it did not make me want to turn pages.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Ray Smith (Kerouac), Japhy Ryder (Snyder), and others are beautiful exotic and eccentric characters, but there seemed to be little inner tension on display.  Who are they trying to become?  What are their difficulties?  Being a wondering Zen rucksacker in the 50's probably wasn't very easy from a societal relationship perspective, but that ripe tension unfortunately was missing from the story.<br /><br />3) Theme (3 stars) - I had a hard time pulling out the message of this book.  What was Kerouac trying to say about the world?  That finding meaning is difficult?  That truths are fleeting?  That ethical systems are relative?  That modern civilization is silly?  There are seeds of all these here, but for me they didn't flower into a cohesive message.<br /><br />4) Voice (3 stars) - On the whole, I enjoyed the writing.  Although the jumping of focus from inconsequential details to \\"meaning of life\\" observations, seemingly from paragraph to paragraph, gave the feeling of being un-edited and rambling.  But again, maybe this range of focus is the point (i.e., every detail in life if equally important).<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - Kerouac does capture a time and place well, and offers us a nice window into what it was like to live with the Beats in San Francisco in the 1950s.<br /><br />6) Overall (3 stars) - I appreciate the cultural significance of the book, and the movement it started, and for that I'm glad I read it, but as a stand alone story I found it hard to get through on several occasions.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Challenging, fun. Very easy to play. Try to beat your score. Just like regular solitare. Only difference is more choices

B009AY04A8|4.0|Playing this game is really fun because there is a story line to follow and the hidden items are not extremely hard to find.  Have good time.
0452273331|5.0|1) Plot (5 stars) - A radical architect fights against an oppressively banal world to bring forth genius and beauty.  Man vs. world is a great recipe for a juicy plot, and Ms. Rand does not disappoint.  Her hero gets pounded and pounded and pounded again, only to get back up.  Every sunray of hope is followed by a thunderstorm of adversity, and I kept reading page after page (and there's 700 of `em) to see if he'll rise again.<br /><br />2) Characters (5 stars) - This is so much the focus of the book that the chapters are even named after them.  Roark is the unwavering individual who follows his own inner compass, while Peter is his foil - the untalented sycophant who rises on charm and guile.  These archetypes were done well, but it was the secondary characters that I found truly interesting.  There's Ellsworth, the critic who extolls brotherhood and equality, while inwardly he knows them not to be virtues but a means to power through manipulation of the weak.  And there's Dominique, the female lead who so loves her man that she embarks on a mission to destroy him just to watch how he doesn't break.<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - Much has been written about Rand's objectivism, so I won't debate whether it's man's intellect and ego or his emotions and empathy that has brought about the best that civilization has to offer.  Personally, I think it's a bit of both.  And Rand does a fine job expressing the unpopular side; I just wish she was a little more even-handed with the other side as well.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - Overall, quite good.  Although at times (especially toward the end) the dialogue did get a bit preachy, long-winded, and artificial.  This was more or less confined to one section and so it was easy to wade through; unlike her later work, Atlas Shrugged, which often felt like twin preachers taking turns reciting the same lecture to each other for page after page.<br /><br />5) Setting (3 stars) - New York in the 1920s and 30s.  This was done fine, but it wasn't really the point of the book.<br /><br />6) Overall (5 stars) - I thoroughly enjoyed this classic - a driving plot, deeply drawn characters, and an unconventional moral to ponder.  Impressive stuff.  Not only would I recommend it, I would read it again.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game free this is it was a club in bed with my dad and you've got done eating habits of it is misonfigutred and you've done with my bro
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|What can I say? It's THE BEATLES!  The band of my youth.  I was really surprised by how good the quality of the picture was.
B001KT6JPA|2.0|They should never have re-cast Clarice Starling. Julianne Moore, who I like, was terrible in this. The Italian cop story line was dumb. The vengeful mis-figured Gary Oldman character was over-the-top. Ray Liotta's character was annoying. Silence of the Lambs should've been able to stand alone as the perfect movie it was.

B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game, but it would be great to have the Ipad features for all tablets. In Ipad you can craft material, decorations, buildings and much more. The dragon can fight other dragons, go in adventures for food, money,  maps  etc. I will be more happy if team lava put the same in all tablets as Ipad app.
0143039431|4.0|1) Plot (4 stars) - A man returns from jail to find his family evicted from their land, and now they must join the great migration of poor fleeing the Dust Bowl to California in search of a new life in the face of natives who don't want them to come.  This is a book about struggle, and the obstacles pile higher in higher for the Joad family as they try to eke out of living.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Taken as a whole, I felt for the Joad family as they did their best to remain human and good in the face of ravenous competition from other hungry families and the cruel anonymous system that would rather see them dead.  But, as individuals, I had a hard time pulling the family apart.  Each of their heartaches and struggles touched me, but they just didn't seem like significantly different people with different desires.<br /><br />3) Theme (5 stars) - Moral commentary abounds in this story.  There's certainly a comment about capitalism in here, how a bank or a company \\"breathes profits and eats interest and money\\" and therefore is an unfeeling machine that can't help but roll over the individual losers at the game, else it will die of hunger.  And there's a comment on ownership, about how hard work and loving makes a true owner, not having the finances to buy it.  And there's also a comment about mass production and complex economic division of labor, how it makes men disconnected from what they produce, and no longer care or appreciate it.  But that's all in the background.  The foreground is the struggle of these realities placed upon a family, and how they cope with them.  How man first is Christianly, then they squabble and fight for the scraps, and then finally some rise up to unite themselves into a protective unionized shield against the unfeeling and unstoppable machine.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - Usually, I can read Steinbeck for hundreds of pages and not get tired.  He's wise, but not preachingly so.  He's sardonic, but not depressingly so.  He's plain-spoken, yet authoritative.  But most of all he's insightful.  Not a landmark, or historical event, or character goes by without a simple yet deep analysis; and the gems are so casually thrown about that you almost take them for granted.  But in this novel, there was just such a high dialogue to narrative percentage that much of that magic was lost in the Oakie conversations.  Don't get me wrong, Steinbeck captured the language and mentality of the Oakies well, I just didn't find them as engaging as the language and mentality of the narrator.<br /><br />5) Setting (5 stars) - The West during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl.  Roaming as a poor itinerant family man in a world that doesn't want you.  I saw the dusty barren fields, felt the hot bumpy car migration, smelled the cramped Hoovervilles, and heard the flickering moments of human joy during the community dance.  I was transported close enough to the experience to know I am very lucky that this wasn't my life.  But it is the life for many still today, or at least a close approximation with only the names and locations changed.  And for that it remains, unfortunately, timeless in setting.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - I liked the novel, and would recommend it, but I didn't love it.  I think it was the characters that kept it at a 4 star and not 5 star level.  I felt for them, but I didn't latch on to them.s plain-spoken, yet authoritative.  But most of all he's insightful.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very entertaining game. I got addicted to it immediately! Great defence type game. Much better than the old version on the computer.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|What wonderful experiments explained in this book.  I have tried several experiments with amazing results.  The VW experiment was fun, fun, fun.  I saw all kinds of colored vehicles.  Sunset beige, Robin egg blue, Sea foam green, even Pink and Black !!!  The butterflies in all colors.  Where I live butterflies are not abundant, so it was pretty miraculous to see Yellow and Orange butterflies.  I even made a claim to see a blue butterfly and low and behold, opened a book with a blue butterfly picture.  Loved it!  Can't say enough of how much I enjoy reading this book.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Have enjoyed this series.  Hope Sookie and Sam are together for life.  Chaplains writes excellent books.  Hard to put down.
B001IFZL50|5.0|This series is excellent, it is truly amazing, and stays extremely true to the book as well. The actors portray the Marines perfectly and make this series top notch!
0316776963|5.0|1) Plot (4 stars) - This is a collection of short memoirs, not a novel, but in general the plots revolve around growing up as a quirky, gay, imaginative kid in North Carolina in the 1970s, and as an adult in New York and Paris.  All the storylines were entertaining, and held together in tightly woven yet fully realized stories.<br /><br />2) Characters (5 stars) - Sedaris himself is the main character, and he doesn't hold anything back when examining his life's actions.  He is petty and whiny and often a poseur, but has an entertaining imagination and a warm heart that can't be covered by all the self-deprecation.  Co-staring in the stories are his wise and sarcastic mother, his no-nonsense dad, and the collection of eccentrics he meets on his journeys.  Sedaris has a gift for distilling the essence of someone in a minor detail or fragment of dialogue.  The level of observation necessary to capture people of all ages and races and levels of mental stability with such clarity is remarkable.<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - Awkwardness, miscommunication, and embarrassment are the focus of Sedaris' work.  But underneath them there is also sweetness and kindness.  Another theme seems to be how the big events we pay so much attention to while they're happening really don't look important in hindsight; instead it's the little unscripted moments, here and there, that are the interesting ones that shape and define us.<br /><br />4) Voice (5 stars) - I don't usually laugh out loud when reading.  Usually it's just a smirk.  But Sedaris can make me snort like no one else.  To me, he is the funniest writer out there.  To label him just a humorist though would be to undersell his writing.  His sentences shine with sensitivity and nuance.  I once saw him read in person and whenever there was the slightest bump in his reading he immediately marked the culprit--whether it was a missed comma, a slightly wrong word, whatever--and the result of this obsessive editing shows in the rhythm and pace of his prose.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - I definitely felt transported to Raleigh of the 70s, New York through the eyes of someone struggling to get by, and Paris as a foreigner.<br /><br />6) Overall (5 stars) - Sedaris' mastery is in the detail and delivery of his characters and prose, and I think in this work, along with \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,\\" he is at the top of his game.  I can read these stories over and over.  Read this book if you're looking to smile.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|An excellent read! This isn't my usual sort of book, as I am reading a lot fantasy at the moment. I liked the cheekiness of the whole adventure! Gabriella knows a thing or two about cricket! If you're looking for a saucy ride, this is a must. Highly entertaining!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Interesting take, its like a biography and a pep talk all in one. I enjoyed reading this one, it was a little quick but apparently there is a whole series by the author.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very uplifting!<br />The experiments are a wonderful way to prove these 9 laws. Completely changed the way I think about life!
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|First a big Thanks to my friend Roy Huff & the writer of this book for gifting me this book! I finally managed to finish reading this book amidst a lot of disturbances ( Read : Travel & Being stuck in a small town with bad connectivity )<br /><br />The title itself is a little Intriguing. Thought I am little grown up to read books in Fantasy Genre, I decided to read the book anyway thanks to Intriguing title & the description.<br /><br />The plot revolves around three friends Owen, Anika & Dante and their battle against the evil Them to save Everville. Owen is transported to a place called Everville from Easton Falls where he meets The Keeper of lands ( A Fron) who kind of explains ( Read the book! You will know what \\"Kind of explains means! I don't want to provide spoilers ) who the evil Them are and what they are up to and what is to expected of Owen. How he manages to  temporarily stop Them using some training from the Art Club Roundabout ( annual contest held by the Art Club headed by a professor who then turns out to be a different person then I initially believed he was)  and with the help of The Echo club (Owen's college club ) is the story.<br /><br />Initially I felt a little lost. But as pages go by the story line becomes a little more clear. The description of the college campus, The Keeper's room, Everville is realistic and well portrayed. The writer does have a good imagination.<br /><br />So what I liked about the book?!<br />Basic plot, the character sketch!<br /><br />What could have been a little better?!<br />Cohesiveness. The narration slipped at times and really was beautiful at times. Other than that I have no complaints.<br /><br />I'd give the book a 4 on 5!<br /><br />And for those who read my review or saw the book cover and feel the trio or the plot is similar to Harry Potter series. Nope. It is nothing like that at all. Don't be fooled by the cover! Read the book!
0770435726|4.0|As an expat, I really felt and shared a lot of point of view from this book, even if I am not an ex CIA agent!!!<br />The story and intrigue are remarkably well written. You can't stop read it, it makes you awaken!!!
0393327345|5.0|1) Plot (5 stars) - Numb and sleepless from a life of business trips, IKEA furniture, and gentle therapy, a man joins an underground fighting club to regain his masculinity and interest in life.  But as the requirements of the club grow more and more dangerous, how far will he go?  I really enjoyed the story arc from beaten down automaton, to underground hero, to the final reveal.  The pace was quick and the tension between the main character and the flight club leader Tyler was strong.<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - The narrator is the wimpy office bee trying to reclaim his life through hitting bottom.  Tyler Durden is his goal--confident, spontaneous, unattached.  Marla is the girl interest, on the edge of suicide and looking for a reason to keep on going.  All three were original, interesting, and fun to ride along with.<br /><br />3) Theme (5 stars) - Self-improvement, and whether the quest for perfection and completion is really the point, or whether self-destruction is a better path to enlightenment.  Or, as Tyler Durden puts it: \\"It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything.\\"  It was a fascinating idea, explored well.  Some say Palahniuk writes of teenage male angst, but I think that sells (at least this work) short.  This is larger than teenage males.  This is the general disillusionment of a modern life full of tiny rewards but empty of large risks.<br /><br />4) Voice (5 stars) - Palahniuk writes from the POV of the main character.  It's a sleepless prose that confuses and jumbles, a beaten down prose that is half angry and half resigned.  It was entertaining and artistic, and really conveyed a mood.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - From the boring condominium and business travel lifestyle, to the squatting in an abandoned dilapidated house, to the sweaty men pounding on each other in basements, all were described to the point that gave my imagination enough to work with.<br /><br />6) Overall (5 stars) - A short and experimental work that fully explores the other side of self-help.  An interesting plot with thoughtful themes, all delivered through creative prose.  Not only would I recommend it, I would read it again.

B008RKGF1I|5.0|Want a gritty and realistic view at the overworked and under-payed with big dreams?  This isn't for you.  Want an uplifting and dance-y view on the whole matter?  Then you're watching the right movie. With little in terms of realism, Flashdance doesn't expect the viewer to believe in its story.  Its aim is more metaphorical... \\"Go for it\\".  This is a fun movie that has great music, cheesy outfits, and a positive and predictable theme.  As I'm only 21 years old, I can't comment on the nostalgic aspect of this movie.  However, I do know that of all the majorly popular 80's movies I'm aware of, this is the one I've heard my mom, who was in her late 20's at the time of release, talk about most. Overall, it's cute and fun. The only negatives I've heard about this movie are that there is too much music and that it's not believable... I'm not sure what people expected from an 80's dance movie, but these things didn't bother me a bit.  Just enjoy it, people!

0142000655|5.0|1) Plot (4 stars) - A sensitive, kind man takes his wife West to start a new life, where she promptly leaves him with two newborn boys and runs off to be a cold, calculating madam at a whorehouse.  The two boys grow without a mother, until one day they track her down and have to deal with her legacy.  This is the general plot, and though at times it was a bit meandering and sub-plotty, it never failed to engage me.  It just goes to show that the masters don't need cliff hangers or who-done-its to pull you along.<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - Adam is fine as the kind, sensitive lead.  And his sons - Aron and Cal - work as his conflicted sons.  But his wife, Cathy, really stole the show with her manipulative cunning and sociopathic nature.  And she was counterbalanced nicely by Adam's friends, the thoughtful and wise Samuel and Lee.  When any of these three secondary characters were on the page, I eagerly read each sentence.<br /><br />3) Theme (3 stars) - Steinbeck himself says that the underlying moral of this story is about good vs. evil (or perhaps about freedom, \\"Timshel\\").  But I really didn't see it that way.  It just seemed like a big, sprawling, messy tale about imperfect humans.  Which was just fine by me.  But, if this was truly meant to be a treatise about the nature of good vs. evil, I didn't think it dug very deep.<br /><br />4) Voice (5 stars) - I can read Steinbeck for hundreds of pages and not get tired.  He's wise, but not preachingly so.  He's sardonic, but not depressingly so.  He's plain-spoken, yet authoritative.  But most of all he's insightful.  Not a landmark, or historical event, or character goes by without a simple yet deep analysis; and the gems are so casually thrown about that you almost take them for granted.  On top of this, he tells the story as a semi-omniscient narrator, sometimes knowing the inner workings of the characters, sometimes not, which gives the whole tale a very fallible, human flavor.<br /><br />5) Setting (5 stars) - I was certainly transported to California at the turn of the century.  All the little details - from the weather, to the way people acted, to the inrushing of \\"new\\" technology--made me feel like I was right there.<br /><br />6) Overall (5 stars) - This is a classic, and deservingly so.  A wonderfully-told epic about two generations of an American family caught up in all the drama and joy and heartache of the day.  Not only would I recommend it, I would read it again.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|thisis a very good movie, but some areas could be taken as pregidous.  please rent this movie, yu will enjoy it
0316154687|3.0|1) Plot (3 stars) - This is a collection of short memoirs, not a novel, but in general the plots revolve around growing up as a quirky, gay, imaginative kid in North Carolina in the 1970s, and as an adult in New York and Paris.  Unlike his previous work, these stories tend to meander, and I found myself skipping paragraphs at times.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Sedaris has an amazing gift for distilling the essence of someone in a minor detail or fragment of dialogue.  But in this work, that gift only shines occasionally.<br /><br />3) Theme (3 stars) - Sedaris traffics in the mundane, seeming to say that it's the little unscripted moments, here and there, that are the interesting ones that shape and define us.  This is a tough trick to pull off, and in the past he was able to do it well.  But in this work, a bird pecking at a window is just that, a bird pecking at a window.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) -To me, he is the funniest writer out there.  But in this book I would only smile, never really laugh.  The wit was still there, but it was scattered.<br /><br />5) Setting (3 stars) - Even though the backdrops were not the focus of his short stories, all were described in enough detail to make the story seem real and not floating in a void.<br /><br />6) Overall (3 stars) - Something happened here.  Whereas in \\"Naked\\" I laughed merrily even though it was a bit unrefined, and in \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" and \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\" I re-read stories again and again to suck all the nuance and wit out of them, here I found myself skimming.  The magic was gone.  Which was sad.  Perhaps an artist only has so much material to work with.  Or perhaps it's hard to keep your edge when you become rich and famous.  I hope not, because I would really like to experience more of Sedaris' mastery before he's done.  Unfortunately, it wasn't here.

0743297334|3.0|1) Plot (3 stars) - In 1920's Europe, a group of American ex-pats who are bored with Paris decide to go watch the bullfights in Spain, a trip which tears them apart.  It's a fine plot, but I felt much of it was devoted to sitting around some café or bar or hotel drinking and having the same conversations, not really getting anywhere or solving anything.  Maybe that was the point, but it didn't make for a very engaging plot.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Jake is the tired, observant narrator, watching the restlessness and boredom of American ex-pats.  Brett is the beautiful woman he and all the other boys fight over.  The characters were nice in that they were rough and real (despite the stilted 1920s expressions), but I didn't find them especially different or interesting.<br /><br />3) Theme (3 stars) - Unfortunately, the only moral I could pull out of this was a negative one--that without individual purpose, or a family to be part of, life is pretty sad and meaningless.  And booze doesn't help either.<br /><br />4) Voice (3 stars) - Hemingway has an easy to read style, but I must admit I was a little disappointed.  He is lauded for his economy of language, but there seemed to be lots of places where there were unnecessary details or repeated thoughts.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - Paris and Spain in the 1920s.  The cafes, the hotels, the bullfights.  I definitely felt like I was in another time and place.  But I wasn't completely transported there because the details were sparse.<br /><br />6) Overall (3 stars) - I finished it, but I don't think I'd recommend it.  Maybe it was revolutionary in its day, but for me it felt a bit empty.
B007TK77QE|2.0|Too much bad language .  Story boring. Took to long for story to develop. I have enjoyed her other novel under a different name
B00BHMEALA|4.0|On November 4, 1979, the American embassy in Iran is stormed and held hostage by a large group of activists, all of whom are upset that the Iranian shah, a man with little support in Iran, was held asylum in the United States during the Iranian Revolution. This was a time that led to major anti-American sentiment in Iran, and it was not a safe place to be. Thanks to the Canadian government, six of the members of the embassy were granted a chance to stay safely within the home of ambassador Ken Taylor while the American CIA (and I believe Canadian government) tried to find a way to get these six people out safely. What follows is a tense thriller, one where the audience is left on the edge of their seat despite knowing the way it all ends (surprise, surprise, non-historians, they do get saved). \\"Argo\\" is a movie that can be argued to deserve the Best Picture award.<br /><br />Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) is a CIA ex-filtration specialist, assigned to evacuate six U.S. citizens out of Iran. After failing to come up with many ideas, he gets a sudden inspiration thanks to his son and \\"Battle for the Planet of the Apes\\". His idea is to create a fake sci-fi movie called \\"Argo\\", and that him and the six citizens would all be members of the crew going to Iran on a location scout. He gains the assistance of award-winning make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and director Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), as well as fellow CIA worker Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston). Eventually, he brings this to the six members (played by Tate Donovan, Clea DuVall, Christopher Denham, Scoot McNairy, Kerry Bishé, and Rory Cochrane), who must learn their characters within a day so they can escape believably through the heavily guarded airport.<br /><br />This is a film that definitely rides on its cast. \\"Argo\\" contains a large ensemble cast, filled with famous actors playing a variety of roles. Affleck, Cranston, Goodman, and Arkin are just a few of the big names tied to this film, and part of the fun in the movie is seeing what famous actor will show up in the movie. This cast is famous for a reason, too, as every actor plays their part well, even the possibly less known actors. Affleck works very well as a trustworthy character (which is in fact one of the major themes of the movie) thanks to his performance, and some of the movie's greatest moments are because of him and his character. The six civilians all are well-acted, too, with their character arc and success at the end of the movie creating not only much of the tension, but a thoroughly heartwarming ending. Sure, the ending isn't a surprise, and it shouldn't be, but the acting and writing of the characters into a likeable group go a long way towards you becoming invested in their success. John Chambers and Lester Siegel are just a delight to the movie (played excellently by Goodman and Arkin), providing a much needed humor to the mix. Lastly, Bryan Cranston gets a moment, too, making viewers familiar with his role on Breaking Bad feel like he's channeling Heisenberg.<br /><br />The plot is well paced, too, and well crafted. The movie begins with an excellent montage that sets the scene for the film, followed by the building of the plan (which is a lot more humorous than it is thrilling, but that helps balance the movie well), then the rescuing of the hostages. The emotion and direction of all of these moments do very well to complement the right tone and the right time. The tense nature of the events and plot of the movie are also excellently crafted. The movie isn't too historically accurate, and shouldn't be taken as such. Still, the setting is expertly crafted to create a tense atmosphere, one that compliments the action of the movie perfectly. Everything about it adds to the thrill: the civilians' struggle to learn their roles, the heated protests and chaotic nature of Iran at the time, the constant close-calls, all of it is technical excellence in making a thrilling movie. It never once matters that they are inevitably saved. Instead, you are worried from moment to moment. The themes of the movie are great as well, with the theme of trust being an especially engaging one throughout the movie.<br /><br />The soundtrack and cinematography also deserve a good mention. The soundtrack is not one of the greatest, but it does well to create the tone of several scenes, especially with a few of the quieter moments at the end. On the other hand, the cinematography is often great. For example, the scene in the bazaar works well due to the way the camera captures the craziness and chaos of the crowded area, and the way the film often recreates famous scenes and pictures helps give the film a bit more believability (in fact, stay for the credits; it shows a side-by-side comparison).<br /><br />\\"Argo\\" is a movie well-deserving of its praise. It is not historically perfect, but in this case, the use of history creates an excellent back drop and complements the drama and thriller aspects of the movie superbly. This movie is engaging to watch and can go down as a highlight of 2012 (at least among non-superhero fans).

0545586178|3.0|1) Plot (3 stars) - After defying the capital by refusing to play their game in the previous book, Katniss is ... forced to do the game again.  What a letdown.  It was as if the author knew that trilogy was the magic word in book sales, and so she just re-wrote the first book to serve as a bridge until she got to new plot developments in book three.  Sure, the rebellion is hinted at in this installment, but it was already hinted at in book one, and it doesn't really get started until book three.  So what really developed plot-wise in this book?<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - I liked the characters in book one, but it didn't seem like they grew, or even changed, in this sequel.  The same Katniss, Peeta, and Gale just get marched on stage for a repeat performance.<br /><br />3) Theme (2 stars) - Unlike the first book, this story's message seemed much more focused on the oppressed proletariat boiling and starting to bubble over in the pot of tyranny.  This theme has been explored countless times in literature, and unfortunately this installment added nothing new to the discussion.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - Catching Fire continues to be told through Katniss' clipped, direct POV.  It is easy to read and gets you in the mood of the tale.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - Once again, Collins' skillfully paints a future that is both different and recognizable.  I could image the picture she paints.<br /><br />6) Overall (3 stars) - I liked this trilogy, but felt that this book was the weakest link.  400 pages were devoted to 50 pages of plot and character development.

0143034901|3.0|1) Plot (3 stars) - In post-World War Two Barcelona, a boy becomes obsessed with a book only to discover many others are as well, for the book is a window into a secret that many want buried.  It was an interesting premise, and throughout I was curious what the final reveal would be, but I also felt the pace was a bit slow and the storyline convoluted.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Daniel is the lead experiencing typical teenage emotional trials while on his quest.  There's also the caring dad, a love interest, a mysterious figure, a villain, and a quirky mentor.  Of the cast, only the quirky mentor Fermin seemed fresh and demanded my attention.<br /><br />3) Theme (2 stars) - This was tough.  To be honest, I had a hard time pulling out a theme.  Love?  Revenge?  Innocence lost?  They were all here, but nothing much was said about them that we haven't heard before.  Perhaps it was something about the multifaceted mysteries that surround us.  But I'm not sure what to think about that besides the world has a deep roots, and we are just the flowers budding at the very end.<br /><br />4) Voice (3 stars) - Zafron's sentences are smooth, but I couldn't help thinking the expressions, descriptions, and emotions were a bit hokey, a bit clich&eacute;d.  Maybe this was the fault of the translator, I don't know.  But it made it hard for me to take it seriously.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - Post-war Barcelona was drawn well--the intricate buildings, the winding streets, the hidden layers of history all around.<br /><br />6) Overall (3 stars) - The Shadow of the Wind has an interesting premise and a textured setting, but I felt the characters and their struggles were frustratingly clich&eacute;d.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Terry Goodkind is amazing. I started reading this series because of the television show, Legend of the Seeker. But now I am hooked on Terry Goodkind's writing. I never imagined how wonderful the world is that the Seeker and Mother Confessor live in. I can't wait to start on Number 3
B0036EH3XE|4.0|.... but, yes, the end of the &#34;ride&#34; was a little bit of a cop out.<br /><br />Look, with science fiction, I'm quite willing to suspend disbelief. And I allow for a little &#34;foolishness&#34; in the plot lines, if it doesn't ruin the story. If we didn't allow that, there wouldn't be much enjoyment. It's a story and the &#34;authors&#34; have to be allowed a certain degree of latitude.<br /><br />But I think they dropped the ball on the ending here. After six seasons of a pretty interesting, often intense, ride, to bring the finale to the conclusion they did was not the best &#34;everybody wins&#34; way to end the series. Too bad. They had me on board for everything they did, even some of the silliness in the middle when it seemed they lost their way in telling the story. Remember, I am very willing to allow the latitude... but only to a point.<br /><br />But, as to the set up to the ending? Yes, season six was still good. I mean, even knowing the bad ending, I still bought the last season.
0345803485|1.0|I do not recommend this book.  I'm begging you, DO NOT BUY IT.  I should have written this a long time ago.  I read the reviews when the book came out, so I bout the entire set when it did, because most of the reviews were great.  I got he series on the glowing reviews of the first book and read them and passed them onto a friend after finishing each 1,  I told her I had a question for her after she finished.  The question was this, if the story had begun with the last few pages of the series would you have read them.  Her answer matched mine, what a waste of time!  The guy's a psycho and needed to be locked up and the key thrown away.  Pure waste of time.

0671004107|4.0|1) Plot (5 stars) - After spending a lifetime listening to the stars, one astronomer finally hears a message to build a machine.  But should humanity build it?  What will the machine do?  Will it be friendly or hostile?  The decision pulls all facets of our modern society to the table for a heated debate and the tension of their interplay and the final result was fascinating.  Sometimes, however, I felt the pace was a bit slow.<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - Ellie is the brilliant scientist charging forward for the cause of the rational, while sometimes missing the subtleties of interpersonal relations or emotions.  She's a romantic which puts her at odds with her fellow scientists, but also deeply analytical which puts her at odds with much of humanity.  On top of it, she's a female in a male dominated profession which allows for sexual and gender conflict as well.  I enjoyed riding along with her on this journey.<br /><br />3) Theme (5 stars) - Are we alone in the universe?  It's so immense that it seems almost mathematically impossible for us to be the only \\"intelligent\\" life form.  But if so, why haven't we made contact?  Is it a lack of technology on our side or theirs?  A lack of interest?  A time or space distance too large to hurdle?  Or are we just too different to understand each other?  This was the surface question of the book, but underlying it was the theme of faith vs. empirical rationality, and how we need both to dream and advance.  A message which was summed up beautifully in the book's conclusion.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - Sagan became famous for translating esoteric scientific principles into simple and engaging parlance for non-scientists, and this ability shines through in his prose.  Through Sagan's eyes all the prosaic backdrop we take for granted--ants, stars, mathematic concepts--come alive with his curiosity and the teeming science behind them.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - The book takes place in a variety of science facilities on Earth, and a bit in outer space.  All were described well and I felt transported there.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - An excellent story on the role of science in our present and future, made accessible through a strong lead, interesting plot, and a kindly professorial voice.  Smart and fun.  I'd recommend it.

038533348X|5.0|1) Plot (4 stars) - A journalist's quest to learn about the scientist who built the atomic bomb leads him to an island in the Caribbean and the three dysfunctional children who share the scientist's last deadly secret.  Plots are usually not Vonnegut's strongest suit, but in this work the plot is structured and clever and snappy.<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - Vonnegut's novels often feature a dry, witty, sardonic presence who serves a \\"sane man in an insane world\\" role.  In this work, this presence is captured in the lead / narrator.  The supporting cast was entertaining as well.  I've heard some describe his characters as \\"cartoonish\\" but I think that undersells them as two dimensional.  They are not.  He might not spend as many words digging into their core, but there's a core to each of them, sometimes deep and interesting ones.<br /><br />3) Theme (5 stars) - This book centers on a religion - Bokononism - which central tenet is to live by the harmless untruths that make you brave and kind and healthy and happy.  So obviously there is a statement about truth vs. lies in here.  But there's also much more: comments on untethered scientific progress, the nature of love, God, the theatrics of politics, man's quest for meaning, among others.  If you like your books leaving you with moral morsels to suck and ponder on, then this is a good story for you to pick up.<br /><br />4) Voice (5 stars) - To me, when Vonnegut is at the top of his game, he writes some of the most precise, insightful, and funny sentences in literature.  Each is so economically crafted; the words so thoughtfully chosen.  He also writes some of the sharpest dialogue, full of misunderstanding and innuendo.  His writing can be art of the highest order - good for the head, good for the heart, and good for the smile muscles.<br /><br />5) Setting (3 stars) - About half of the book takes place in the Northeast US and the other half on an island in the Caribbean.  Both are described fine, but setting didn't really seem to be the point of this book.<br /><br />6) Overall (5 stars) - Perhaps Vonnegut's best all-around work.  There's wisdom, humor, and just an enjoyable ride packed in here.  I've taken the ride a few times now to see what I missed before and what lessons I did see but have forgotten since.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|(The Rating on this review, is for the many bootleg copies being offered online, and not for it's musical worth). I find it rather amusing that the highlighted photo of the back cover is 'the bootleg version' of this Box Set. If you look at the back cover picture of the box set, you will see at the bottom right, that it is 'Printed in EU.' Also, the authentic version has the FBI PIRACY SEAL directly to the left of the bar code. This back cover picture does not have one. A lot of folks have gotten ripped off by the Chinese Bootleg Version of this Box Set. When in doubt, contact the Seller with specific questions.

1400032717|4.0|1) Plot (4 stars) - A boy with Asperger's sets off to solve the murder of a neighbor's dog, only to uncover the secrets of his own life.  What was so brilliant about the plot was not the final reveal (which the reader can guess before the limited main character can), but the tension of imagining this special needs kid trying to navigate across London by himself.<br /><br />2) Characters (5 stars) - Christopher has Asperger's--he's hyper-analytical, obsessive, has no sense of other people's emotions, and the slightest disorder will send him into a fit.  Yet with all these difficulties he is still brave enough to push out of his comfort zone to solve his case.  It's hard enough to assert your independence in a world of people like you, but this book shows the coming of age struggle when you're surrounded by aliens.  Speaking of aliens (i.e., the \\"normal\\" people in this book) they were also done magnificently, representing the full gamut of responses people have when encountering someone like Christopher--from teasing, to sympathy, to the challenge of being his parent.<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - What it's like to be a stranger in a strange land.  We've seen this explored from the standpoint of ethnic minorities, females, gays, immigrants, and here we get it from the view of a mental minority.  Like with the others, this book sheds light on how society isn't built for all its citizens.<br /><br />4) Voice (5 stars) - Incredible.  Haddon's prose makes you feel like you have autism / Asperger's, makes you see every bit of the world through Christopher's eyes, which is remarkable magic.<br /><br />5) Setting (3 stars) - Setting wasn't really the point, but London was described fine.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - Highly recommended.  This is an important work which gives insight into the next group of minorities that society can either shun or accommodate.

0140177396|4.0|1) Plot (4 stars) - Two friends--George and Lenny--tied together by a sense of mutual responsibility and a shared dream, doggedly try to save enough money to buy a farm of their own, only to meet obstacle after obstacle.  The outer obstacles are engaging, but what really kept me reading was the inner obstacles.  Specifically, the ticking time bomb that was Lenny.<br /><br />2) Characters (5 stars) - An excellent character study of an unusual friendship.  George is the reluctant care-taker, outwardly critical of Lenny because he's too guarded to admit his affection.  He wants to be tough and calculating in his plan for freedom, but his inward goodness can never let him betray his friend.  Lenny is the doting follower, simple and warm and emotional.  He is capable of great love and great hurt and it's fascinating not knowing which direction his simpleness will take him.<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - Obviously, the big theme here is friendship and how it's not what you say but what you do that makes you a friend.  But there were other interesting minor themes, too.  Like petty dominance plays, and how the quest for the top of a hierarchy, no matter how small and insignificant that hierarchy is in the grand scheme of the world, will cause men to do vicious things.<br /><br />4) Voice (5 stars) - I can read Steinbeck for hundreds of pages and not get tired.  He's wise, but not preachingly so.  He's sardonic, but not depressingly so.  He's plain-spoken, yet authoritative.  But most of all he's insightful.  Not a landmark, or historical event, or character goes by without a simple yet deep analysis; and the gems are so casually thrown about that you almost take them for granted.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - The life of an itinerant worker on a California farm--the shared bunks, the sweaty manual labor, the horseshoe games, the alienation and loneliness and simple dreams--all were done well.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - Sometimes you don't need hundreds of pages to deeply and profoundly examine human relations, if it's done crisply and deftly and poignantly, as Steinbeck does here.  I definitely recommend this work.to deeply and profoundly examine human relations, if it's done crisply and deftly and poignantly, as Steinbeck does here.  I definitely recommend this work.

1594746036|5.0|Jacob Portman is a bored 16 year old, living in Florida, working for his rich relatives and musing over his lack luster ordinary life. As a small child, Jacob was close to his grandfather Abraham, who had told him wonderful exciting stories which had Jacob hanging on every word, especially the ones about the orphanage on an isolated Island off the coast of Wales that Abraham was sent to. He was also fascinated with the photographs of the strange children that Abraham had said lived with him. Now as a teenager, Jacob thinks the stories were made up; and he would have filed them away under things-old-men-imagine, but then something terrible happens to Abraham, and he leaves Jacob a cryptic message that has him trying to find answers to his grandfather's past, and the mystery of the peculiar children in the photographs.<br /><br />I have wanted to read this book ever since its first release in 2011, since then it became a best seller. It was so worth waiting for, I devoured it in a few days: totally enthralled with the story and fascinated by the weird photographs woven into the novel. It is a YA book that adults will love, there is some strong language (teenage boy swearing) and it can be scary at times. The writing is almost flawless, aside from a little dialog that didn't match when two different cultures converse, but it is a fantasy. I'm giving it 5 stars and it is now one of my favorites; and oh joy, the sequel will be out in 2014, and a movie is on schedule for 2015: let's hope they do it justice.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for all horse lovers.  Kids a nd adults of all ages will have a wonderful time with their own horse.  Visuals are great.
0553208845|5.0|1) Plot (4 stars) - In ancient India, one man searches for enlightenment, traveling from priests, to ascetics, to Buddhists, to sensuality, to material wealth and power, to fatherhood, and back to the beginning again.  This is a short novel, and Siddhartha's quest jumps speedily from one investigation to another--long enough to satisfactorily explore the doctrine, but not so long that the philosophy becomes tiresome.<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - Siddhartha is the hero, and he certainly had a heroic personality--wise, kind, and curious.  He also had an interesting inner struggle, one that most of us don't have.  He seemed perfect from the beginning, and yet struggled for something more, perhaps in part because he felt alien to those around him who were still tied to childlike pleasures and follies.  The other characters were done well, representing either a source of wisdom or a source of contrast for Siddhartha.<br /><br />3) Theme (5 stars) - Nothing less than the search for the purpose of life.  This book certainly had a Buddhist slant--so I suppose it's not a complete search -but it's as close to a complete exploration of this theme that I have seen.  I felt like I lived a whole life of searching in 150 pages.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - Hesse's \\"Germanness\\" comes out a bit it in the writing in that it has short, crisp, un-playful sentences.  But I found the prose to fit the story perfectly.  This was an analytical quest for enlightenment, and Hesse's voice systematically and precisely describes the journey.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - India at the time of the Buddha.  Although the setting wasn't the focus, it was done well in the background.  I certainly felt like I was in another time and place.<br /><br />6) Overall (5 stars) - Wow.  Such a journey, such wisdom, packed into so few pages.  If you've ever wandered or wondered, read this book.
0671004107|5.0|Carl Sagan's CONTACT is one of those great books that has been devalued and \\"spoiled\\" by the movie version. I read the book first, and loved it. But today's new readers tend to come from seeing the movie CONTACT first, then wanting \\"more.\\" They are then disappointed.<br /><br />The story is essentially the same in both book and movie adaption. The drama in the book is understated (I think because the ideas are the real heroes). The drama in the movie is over-the-top spectacular (to the detriment of the ideas, in my opinion, although I have to confess that I have watched the movie many times--fast forwarding through the dull spots--while I just did my second read of the book CONTACT--skipping over the dull spots, which I didn't during the first read).<br /><br />The ending in the book stunned and thrilled me. Hadden in his spaceship sarcophagus. A message from \\"The Artist\\" inside pi.<br /><br />The ending in the movie fell apart. The wormhole was a great ride, but the actual \\"meeting\\" with the aliens didn't work for me. In fact, the only thing that \\"worked\\" for me after that was the short James Woods phone conversation about the silent minutes on Ellie's recorder.<br /><br />The book CONTACT presented a sort of \\"scientist's version of God\\" that even atheists might be able to appreciate, hidden in mathematics. The movie's ending went for \\"Box Office.\\"<br /><br />@hg47
1400034205|5.0|I bought it because I thought it might help me on my road of self-discovery and I thought it might give me some new ways of looking at how I might lead my life, and it did. It's written in first person, and believe it or not, that works really well for this book. A lot of people don't like first person books, but I definitely think he pulled it off with this one.
B001F63D66|4.0|Very fun movie with enough plot twists to keep it interesting.  Elisha Cuthbert is fantastic as the girl next door.  She's sweet enough to make you love her and sexy enough to make you &#34;want&#34; her.  Really good movie.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I have tried several programs trying to get MS Office Suite including Outlook to work on my Samsung Android but they were all so limited and difficult to use that I would give up every time. Then I came across the Documents to Go. I had used this program a few years ago on my Blackberry but had lost the program a long time ago. Then I came across this one and it works great! I can use it to move and use files from my laptop to my Samsung phone and Samsung tablet, PDF files, Word, Excel ... wonderful. And, in addition,  it is reasonably priced. Thank you.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Both the show and book are awesome. I watched the show and read the book after and it was great.
0345529057|5.0|Why is everyone reviewing the kindle version? This is the paperback! I wanted this series and I wanted it cheap. That's what I got and I'm happy. I'm not planning on handing these books on to my children's children. Yes, they are cheaply made hence the price. I haven't had any issues. And it arrived before expected.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|This is one of the best cartoon movies of all time and the music is fabulous. I love this movie and I'm over 60
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a pretty addicting game and a good way to kill some time.  Haven't had any issues with it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great time-waster! I love the challenge of trying to get combos. I suggest using your starting points missile speed. I enjoy it.
B00030DEQE|5.0|I used in my lad running VMware vSphere 5.1. VMware has no problem with the drivers and work great for vMotion.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this on the 1st day and hence got 3 months of Netflix free (actually 4 months, since I signed up for a free month of Netflix). If you have a Smart TV (I don't), this is a useless piece of Junk. Hence this device caters to a (small?) subset of people who have a HDMI TV but not a Smart HDMI TV.<br />When you cast from your Computer in 720P mode, the video is choppy and  crashes. I have a very good Wireless Router, so that is not the issue.<br />Currently, all it does for me is it streams YouTube and Netflix from my Android Phone or Laptop.<br />On the good side, this device looks cool. It came it with a HDMI extension, which I use.<br />To me, with the free Netflix and the ability to watch old National Geography and Discovery Channel programs on my TV is worth the $38.06 I paid for it.<br />Not very impressed with Netflix, but that's another story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mindcraft is cool . I which it had a enchantment table .<br />If you got a kindle fire  buy pocket inv editor
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Better than average for the genre. I like how the characters all came together at the end. There was a hint of the Justice League. Good movie for kids over 13 and adults.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|I have never been disappointed with Belkin products and this is no exception. What I have here is an attractive, well made case that does justice to my Kindle Reader. The zipper(s) function without a stutter and the case is constructed in such a way that I fell comfortable that my Kindle is well protected. The leather-like wrap around provides a secure grip even in hot weather when perspiration can create a problem. This is first quality at a reasonable price!
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|We're the Millers stars Jason Sudeikis as David Clark, Emma Roberts as Casey Mathis, Will Poulter( Eustace in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) as Ed Helms as Brad Gurdinger, and the very attractive Jennifer Aniston as Rose. The cast did exceptionally well; and delivered a lot of humor from start to finish.<br /><br />We're the Millers is a movie that is meant to entertain(and it does). Expect anything from Jennifer Aniston's character doing seductive strip teases, to Jason Sudeikis's character have a life changing experience involving a finger. The movie is very funny and has its clever moments as well.<br /><br />2013( particularly summer) has been an above average year for the comedy genre. This Is the End, The Heat, and a few others have surprised audiences with the likable humor, and well thought up storylines. We're the Millers is funny, cool and is guaranteed to take you on a hilarious trip quite like no other. I rate this movie a highly likable<br /><br />7.9/10
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|this a great movie i defently recomend geting this movie i saw it in the theater it is great defently
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I really makes me think. Its like exercise for your brain. It helps you refresh your brain . As they say &quot;a puzzle a day keeps the doctor away&quot;.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Bought this because of all the hype surround it, and was rather disappointed.  Didn't particularly like the characters and was glad when the story was done.  I don't think I'd recommend this one.  A downer.
0307895505|5.0|With this guide, I don't need to use YouTube as much for help with Skyrim.  My only regret is not getting the hard back edition.
B00BEIYH6U|4.0|I do not consider myself a movie critic, but I am an avid movie goer and watcher. Sometimes, certain critics will enjoy movies that audiences may not always enjoy and vice versa. Following the release of this movie it has been slammed by critics as \\" falls flat\\" and \\"lacking\\". After months of anticipation, i saw Kick Ass 2 today. All I want to say is forget the critics and negative press because this movie is good.<br /><br />Kick Ass 2 brings back Aaron Taylor Johnson as Dave Lizewski \\" Kick Ass\\"( he buffed up) Chloe Moretz returns yet again and gives a great performance as Mindy Macready \\" Hit Girl\\". Also returning are Lyndsy Fonseca as Katie Deauxma, and Christopher Mintz Plasse takes the role of antagonist to the extreme playing Chris D'Amico. New, but exciting additions include: Morris Chestnut as Marcus Williams, Donald Faison as Doctor Gravity, Tom Wu as Genghis Carnage, Lindy Booth as the female hero of the night, and Jim Carrey as Colonel Stars and Stripes. There are many other supporting actors/actresses, but the actors I mentioned all were great; Jim Carrey, Chloe Moretz, and Christopher Plasse were the highlights.<br /><br />Ever read those stories about heroes teaming up? Well picture that; only this time bad guys/girls do the exact same. This movie also has a small element from Spider-Man 2 whereas the main hero wants to be normal and put being a superhero in the past. The movie as a whole delivers in terms of action, and relatively extreme humor. I do also feel that the seriousness in the questions:  What is a superhero? or What does it take to be a superhero? is upped even further in the sequel.<br /><br />Kick Ass 2 does lack the epic feel, or rather classic quality that its predecessor has, but it is NOT a bad movie. It is not nearly as memorable as the 1st, but fortunately despite the minor flaws, it is enjoyable nonetheless. If you love the 1st as much as I do you may not \\" love\\" this one, but I honestly think you will have a good time. I give the sequel a score of<br /><br />4 starse sequel a score of<br /><br />4 stars
B0006GAOCW|5.0|This is the best Hallmark love story yet.  I've already scene this movie 3 times.  It had everything...  family values, romance, and everything else you expect to see in a movie.  The characters and the wardrobe were stunning.  Very well casted.  Katie Holmes and her hunky handsome (boyfriend, R.A., Secret Service guy) seemed like a perfect match.  The way they danced together.  Either their the best actors ever or there was real electricity going on between the two.<br /><br />The ending eluded that there may be a sequel.  I hope so.  I'd like to know when and what the sequel will be called.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|This is a good read with a surprise ending.  Had a hard time deciding whether the book was just okay or good..  The ending gave the book a high rating.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Great third book, I just can't believe it just ends. Now I have to wait who knows how long to see how Eva and Gideon's crazy, convoluted relationship and past lives end up.
B001CC7PPI|5.0|Beyond the obvious enticement of Grace Kelly trying (and succeeding) in being seductive with James Stewart...<br /><br />I believe that Hitchcock said, &#34;suspense is not when two people sit at a table with one or both knowing that there is a bomb underneath. Suspense is when is when the same two sit at the same table and neither know that a bomb is underneath. Only the audience watching the movie knows of the bomb.&#34;<br /><br />That same anticipation, that same terror is seen in James Stewart when he inadvertently reveals himself to Raymond Burr. James has been the audience (up to that point), but now Raymond knows. Both James and the movie viewer watch in the growing anticipation of the confrontation between James and Raymond. It is excruciatingly delicious.<br /><br />My highest recommendation.
B00CX7TOTQ|4.0|This was a good movie, I can't say that I loved it, but I did LIKE it. Story was not bad. It was good to see two great actors together.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Far beyond story I expected. Compelling, haunting, and thought provoking with characters that will never leave you amidst an event that has never left the minds of people since 1963. Fantastic writing that moves you through the suspense filled story effortlessly!
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|great footage,lots of obscure classics,lick and a promise.highly recomended,glad to see Dream On was left out,more room for other stuff
141694737X|5.0|So far the whole family enjoys reading this book.  It was bought as a baby shower gift, and is just wonderful!  Obviously the baby isn't reading it, but the family reads to the baby, and she really seems to enjoy it.
B00CRPZXFI|5.0|A very unique and 1 off album. Enjoyed every minute of it. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a slight interest in music.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It was a great choice for free app of the day. Easy to use, challenging. Not buggy. Its a good game to play while sharing at the DMV.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it this is the best game everyone rate 5 stars. Rate for free points if you love it!!!&iexcl;!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JLCI|5.0|Kenneth Branagh is one of my favorite Shakespearean actors/directors, and this film only solidifies that for me. While he is too old for a traditional interpretation of The Bard's classic piece, Branagh brings light, life, and longing to the role that many younger actors simply cannot do. Every line of Shakespeare's play is present (albeit slightly re-arranged now and then), and it only adds to the timelessness of this play. Ophelia (Kate Winslet) is well-played, and she goes beyond the simple-minded, traditional playings of this character; Winslet gives her a depth that many overlook. A standing ovation, to be sure.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Love the song &#34;Come and Get IT&#34;!  Selena has maturied in her music, but still has good values for girls.
B00796E7CA|5.0|Tolkein's vision continues to amaze this newbie fan. I wish, however, that I'd read this before I read The Book of Lost Tales I & II. Armed with this background, one of these days I'm going to reread The Lord of the Rings in &#34;enhanced mode.&#34;
140006922X|5.0|It was impressive, though I must say I am pretty sure there is more strength in the position of Jesus as a man of peace whose actions were expressions of shalom.  Aslan is a great story teller.  Amazing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good. Study Bible and easy to search and find verses. Easy to find by relevance or topical. I have tried. another Bible App which did have some different advantages but for everyday study or to use in small in-home Bible Study this one works great. Nice to turn on the voice read and let it do the overall reading to a small study group. I've been using this everyday for about 8 months now and still totally love the format and the variable changes offered. Glad I tried this one first!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|It was way to short and gave far to many clues, basically giving away the whole game aside from these two issues it was fun and intriguing.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|We enjoyed this movie, it was very cute.  Streisand and Rogen had good mother/son chemistry.  It was very funny and cute
B00E193Y36|4.0|ivan's vocals are great.  Song mix is decent.  eclectic. good morning wake up music and long commute tide me over
B003JH8LPW|4.0|In this electronic age data gathering takes another meaning and occurs in many different ways at lightning speeds. This book exposes the possibilities in this digital age. Arguably. Dan Brown written books uniquely project plot authenticity and this one is no exception. I recommend this book to the casual readers of fictional thriller books.
0140067477|5.0|Uses your most beloved characters to Give great philosophy and use all different perspective to explain how to just be. Beliefs of taoism and even ig its not your religion, gives you insight.
1401225756|4.0|I bought this for my sister for her birthday.  I love Neil Gaiman's &#34;The Sandman&#34; and I hope she does as well!<br />I selected two day shipping, which guaranteed that it would get to her 3 days before her birthday; however, it's a day past her birthday and the package has still not arrived.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Great tribute to Sound City studios and so awesome to hear the history from the actual artists who's careers were launched because of this legendary studio!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|though energy seems to run out too fast, it is a fun game to get your mind into. with all the scenes and ogects that you have to find, this game keeps you entertained.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|my Husband Loves To Play This addicting And Fun Game To Play. Easy To Use And Really For Any Age.
0385484518|5.0|I cried, laughed and smiled through my time reading this book. Very simple but wise words from such a kind hearted man.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Useful in too many ways to list. Anything you need to save online and/or add notes to comes together perfectly in this app.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I just love this damn book n I can't wait to see what happens next to them I hope it will be good.
0307593312|3.0|Not as good as some of author's other work.  Stretched out a little too long. His briefer work is better
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I have been playing this game since April 17 2013 I have been so hooked on it that I've gotten others to download the app. Our whole family now plays on different devices, the graphics on my Kindle fire HD are amazing,  I've been so addicted to playing this game day &amp; night that I'm ashamed to say I've spent an unbelievable amount of $$$ on acorns both my ice world &amp; Dino world were looking amazing then I started noticing glitches, like the game freezing up to the point I would have to shut my device down, then other times I would be kicked out of the game &amp; it would return me to the home page, with all of this I reached level 54 &amp; was looking forward to leveling up when my game crashed &amp; I lost everything I was very unhappy we contacted the company &amp; got a stock reply that they were working on the  problem  I  had been enjoying the game for months until that happened so I restarted a new game I don't believe the glitches have been fixed so we are trying to back up the game on our lap top computer, the game is very fun but can run into costing real cash if you are trying to get all the animals &amp; fun stuff, I sure hope the  company gets ALL of the glitches fixed or there will be a lot of unhappy costumers!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I gave it 5 stars as my 5 year old grandson loved it.  It was challenging, fun, colorful, and easy to relate to as each level slowly built in difficulty.<br /><br />I'd recomment this for children 5-95.  Even Grandma likes to play it:-)
B00B9366VO|5.0|cool.....! Rupert Neve...Analog...Really interesting look at prime time L.A. studio scene..in the trenches so to speak! Thoroghly Enjoyable w/ Great MUSIC!
B009AY04A8|5.0|ALOT of dialogue, of which I could do without, but fun to play, even with ALL the tapping. Would recommend to all ages.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Awesome game! I'm so glad they made this game for handheld device. Even the new additions to the game you earn, with no additional money from your pocket.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Decent game for a Free App Of The Day. I probably wouldn't have bought it if it wasn't free, but since it was I can see myself devoting a few hours of time to playing it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|My five year old grandson loved this game - it was challenging, yet something he could easily relate to so kept engrossed in the game.
B0096CDG0O|3.0|Disappointed that the game doesn't let me know when my opponent has played. That's why I paid for the app vs the free version. I still have to go back out to see when they've played.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great story by Hosseini.  Not predictable and I loved how he wove all the characters together. A wonderful love story from many angles.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Game is easy but pretty entertaining.  The graphics are good.  I have not completed the game yet but of the portion that I have played I was able see without having to zoom in on the picture alot.  My only complaint so far is the amount of dialogue.  There is alot to read but other than that I am satisfied with this game.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This is an excellent movie. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are excellent co-stars. Both funny and serious at the same time. I had rented this movie on demand from my cable provider and when I saw it for an excellent price here on Amazon I couldn't pass it up.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Really like watching episodes all at once...some really raw acting by some new faces....easy to forget the actors are not really prisoners...I've already recommended this to friends..(this is actually a Netflix review...watched it there then got the kindle edition)
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This is a useful USB cable which fits fine and works well for the use which which it was purchased for.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is my first Kate Morton book and I will be reading The Distant Hours.  She is a great story teller and I did not see the end coming, not predictable at all.  Loved the characters and the way she wove them all together.  Didn't want it to end.
B00A32CKKI|4.0|good book very interesting story hard to read because of the way words were spoken.  It was for English honors class.
0399226907|5.0|This book is simply great. It has helped my son (2 1/2) with counting and identifying pictures and the concept of reading a book. The different size pages (and the holes) make the reading fun.
B008JFUO36|3.0|I saw it at the theater, but came in 5 minutes late . That threw Me off , so when I bought it an saw it again , all things came in place.  This movie isn't a brainer , it's a decent story and Tom Cruise did a good job . They whole movie falls in place during the last half hour . It's a movie the whole family can watch an is very entertaining . Morgan Freeman is getting there in age , so His part is small an is a waste of His talent , so parts like this is all He can get anymore. It's worth watching.
B004VD3YIM|3.0|Easy to add cameras, has a professional look and feel..BUT...none of the camera control features work. None, no pan/tilt, presets, na da...
B000SEFNMS|4.0|While I liked this book and found the true story quite compelling, I did not expect to be reading so much of the author's comparisons of his own life events to those of Christopher McCandless.  Whenever I found a quiet time to read and found myself reading about Krakauer's life, I became cranky that I was not getting what I bargained for.  Overall, however, I enjoyed the story (if one can &#34;enjoy&#34; a true story  that ended tragically).
0451418441|5.0|Very interesting time in History. The character development pulls you in. The book presents the perilous struggle between good and evil, wisdom and stupidity. In this book, true leadership comes from the ordinary man rather than the church or the royality.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app is very useful for me because I use the kindle fire. It is very easy to use and includes bonus features like ES Downloader. You should get this app. It is the best.
B00441GYZ6|5.0|Woody Harrelson did a excellent job in playing Larry Flynt. What I like most about this movie is the fact that it is both entertaining and educational. It addresses the First Amendment to the Constitution, particularly parts dealing with Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Religion. As a law student, I highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting to learn about their constitutional rights.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Great acting, different story line. Refreshing.<br />Watch it. Everyone enjoys the movie.<br />There are great movies you can watch online.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminds me of the old missile commander game by atari!  Thank you for bringing back this classic.  I had alot of fun&middot;
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I love this app. The only problem I have is trying to get my music from the app on my kindle onto my computer. Other than that it is great and I would recommend it to others =)
B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you are new to the game that's ok cause this teaches  you everything you need to know about the card game and the app while making you feel like a boss attacking your opponent. The game also has a great multiplayer and single player mode  that let's you fight an A.I. that's challenging but not impossible to beat. Great game.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I love Criminal minds!! I have been washing the show since season 1... I never miss an episode, excellent actors... I love you Derek Morgan
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Oblivion was a really good movie which surprised me with a complex story. I really loved the ideas presented and the special effects and props were very nice. Very realistic. I will own this on bluray.
B0086700CM|4.0|You don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play this once it is downloaded, which is something I would like to see more games manufacturers realise is what a Kindle tablet is all about.  You want to play these games when you get home, or are somewhere with no free Wi-Fi.  I also liked how this one gave you a quick tutorial on how to play, most other games you've got to work everything out through trial and error.<br /><br />Previously I downloaded a game called Running Fred. Temple Run is pretty similar to that, just with better graphics and set in an overgrown South American jungle with a horde of black monkeys chasing you.  Basically the Indiana Jones type character is always running, you just turn him and make him jump.  Like with Running Fred once you know the course it becomes easy (and a bit boring) until you get to a new bit of screen you've never made it to before where the aim is to last as long as you can before jumping over something and into a ravine you didn't know was there, hitting a wall or getting killed by something else.
0345803485|3.0|I really didn't think this book was well written, then I talked to several other people who thought the same thing.  It's steamy but other than that, no thanks.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. Super fun. Wish it was easier to earn gems. Wish it was easier to get other horses. Overall very fun.
0761174192|5.0|These cat-a-day calenders are a must have...each day, except the weekend which bundles Sat./Sun. together, is another wonderful fur-person for you to enjoy...can't wait for January 2014 to begin my yearly journey through &#34;cat~dom&#34;...wonderful gift for yourself or a cat lover friend...
B0048KXRR6|3.0|Movie was as expected. Bratty kids in the beginning turn out to behave in the end. Everything ends with smiles and rainbows and bad guys being taken away.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|So different from the other two, but still engulfing. A book you think about a long time after you've finished it.
