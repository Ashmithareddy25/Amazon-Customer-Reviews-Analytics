0812550706|5.0|I am not going to repeat the other reviews here.  I keep having to buy more copies of this book, as I recommend it, lend it out, and find that the lender has passed it on to THEIR friends.  Yes, it's as contagious as the flu!  My friend gave a copy to his buddy, who started reading it in his car at lunch.  He did not come back until the next day, when he admitted he spent the rest of the day finishing the book in his car!
B005OGYH90|5.0|Awesome concert footage and interview of Slash in Stoke,England where he was born. I love Slash and buy everything he creates <3
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Don't expect Layne Staley on this album, he's gone and we need to move on...because the band certainly has. Now, with that said, Jerry Cantrell takes over the majority of the vocals on this record, which is fine by me, and William DuVall handles his role as backing vocalist really well. DuVall also handles lead on a couple of tracks, noticeably &#34;Last of My Kind&#34;. Overall this album is really well produced, and really well played. A nice comeback for AiC.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Both of my son's have been playing since Christmas last year.  The game has crushed at least 5 times.  It goes back to level one.  My oldest son was on level 56 .when he lost at least 10 families.  Customer service told me I need to get it updated which I did but it made the game start from level 1 again!  Very disappointing but it is a fun game.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|While this is certainly another good record by AiC, I still think BGWTB is a better record. This one is much slower/sludgier than its predecessor but that doesn't mean it's a bad record. It certainly ranks up there with their 1995 self titled album.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game rocks I like it because it's  a strategy game plus it is for kids around my age and I like that it can never really end
B000BH4YJ0|5.0|This is the type of music that puts me in the right frame of mind. Whether driving to work or going on a road trip.  I could listen to him all the time.
B009C7JS14|3.0|Well first let me say HELLO 2 THE WEATHER MAN,THANX 4 THE FORCAST OF RAIN IN MY FUTURE. GUESS I NEED 2 GO BUY AN UMBRELLA.  THANX 4 COMIN OUT,GOD BLESS,N GOOD NIGHT.....
B005KISHDY|5.0|I was skeptical about picking this set up, only being 300 pieces and a suggested price of $39.99. I was blown away by this set when I finally picked it up, though! The lava platform scene in Episode 3 is pivotal to the entire saga and faithfully recreated here: Anakin and Obi-Wan both have double-sided faces for during- and after-battle expressions (including the infamous yellow \\"Sith eyes\\" on Anakin/Vader!) Nute Gunray looks amazing as well. The starfighter is a fun and interesting build, and looks very much like its movie counterpart. (Remember, this is Anakin's *second* starfighter in the movie - which was green. His yellow one from the beginning of the film was destroyed in the crash on Coruscant.)<br /><br />Overall, the figures and playset pieces are the main draw of this set - but that's no slight on the starfighter at all! R2 sits faithfully in his slot on the left wing, true to the model. If you're a fan of the prequels or of Lego playset pieces, this set will thrill you. Don't let the low piece count fool you: this has loads of play value and takes a reasonable amount of time to build. Even the stickers included are easy to apply properly!<br /><br />Pros: Excellent minifigures, entertaining build, faithful recreation to the film.<br /><br />Cons: Stickers, possibly misprinted pieces (this has been acknowledged by Lego and their customer service in replacing defective parts is *excellent*.)<br /><br />Summary: Absolutely worth it for Lego and Star Wars fans alike.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Okay, I have seen some bad reviews I don't agree with. Yes gems to buy Rarity but that's if you want to buy her early. Just wait a little and it will change to coin bits. You obviously have no patience if you don't think it changes fast enough. This game is very promising and like that.
B008C20TDG|2.0|I found no background to support this, it made no sense to me it needs a lot more reserch too
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is one of my favorite games ever! Lots of cute animation, good game play, I've played it over and over. Works great on computer, tablet or phone. Can't wait for Plants Vs. Zombies 2 comes out!
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|Emma Stone nails it in this film. Her parents are awesome (the Tucc!), the rest of the cast is great and fit their roles very well. I could watch this once a week and still love it.
B007HACDLK|1.0|This book suddenly appeared on my Kindle as one I ordered. I DID NOT ORDER IT !!!<br /><br />Cannot understand how this happens, and feel Amazon has a problem. This is not the first time this has happened.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This movie is great! Well thought-out, well acted, excellent concept. I think this movie is fantastic and I have been looking forward to a sequel for quite awhile.
B0085X31VE|5.0|I was blown away by this album. I never heard of Ne Obliviscaris before and found them by accident through Facebook. I agree with all positive and very in depth reviews here. Super talented people, very nice production with a beautiful artwork and a poster. I just hope they will tour here in the US, I will most definitely love to see them live. I gave all 5*, I would give 10* if I could!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini developed many characters in a woven thread of stories that spanned multi-generations, cultures and continents. Common life lessons and truths were embedded in stories and revealed one by one. A story of the power of love.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Before I read this, I saw a lot of bad reviews.  I don't get it.  Having read the entire series, I am more than happy with the final chapter. This book is right in line with the rest of the series. I don't know what those people were expecting but Charlaine Harris did just what she always does.  Gives me a bunch of story lines I was not expecting while still ending up in a place that makes perfect sense. The story ended ultimately (no spoiler here, don't worry) the way it had been heading since book one. Well that's my opinion anyway.  I can't see why anyone would say the book was bad, unless they watched the TV show and thought it would be like that. If you are new to the series, start with book one but know that after that there is not much in common with the show True Blood. After book one, they go their separate ways. The books are light reading, you will get through them quickly. In conclusion, I believe if you have read the rest of the series and keep it separate from the TV show, you will enjoy this book.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|It's nice to be able to watch television with interesting characters and good clean and interesting stories.  You get to now the characters on this show like they are neighbors.  Why is it that America refuses to create quality programming for viewing by all young and old?
B00B7FOQCK|1.0|Mine had a loose connection. A connected device would constantly switch back between connected and disconnected state constantly resulting in annoying error messages. No data transfer was possible.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This was as good as everyone said it was, and yes, it did make me cry. Definitely worth a watch, especially because I think the sequel, Monsters University, is, surprisingly enough, even better!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is a great way to kill time, only down fall is running out of energy. its quite a bit like frontierville on facebook.
B0068THAGY|5.0|This is an excellent movie and I thought I wasn't going to like it at all. It's not overly sci-fi like I thought it might be, there is a really sweet young love story narrative between the two main characters, and the acting is unbelievable considering their ages. I also feel like I got some insight into Spielberg's childhood, in a way, too, which was really fun and interesting. Would recommend to anyone!
B000WS4PCO|4.0|The first four songs on this album are really good. The remaining songs are ok. I'm not a big U2 fan, but this is good album.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|so confused and what a waste of actors, locations, etc etc!<br />the book was wonderful, and this film did nothing to capture the shifts in language, modes of expression, social mores....<br />I wanted to like this,but EVEN JIM BROADBENT couldn't save this clunker....<br />my advice:<br />read the book.
B00BX3KZAS|4.0|This is a good Bodom album. If you are a fan of Children Of Bodom, you will enjoy this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg I love this game. It's really fun and addictive! my daughter and husband also love it. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|As a 50+ grandmother I loved playing this game. So did my children and grandchildren. Each level got progressively more challenging.  I hope that the creators eventually build a skyscraper of levels.
B0041KW6PC|3.0|I barely got it.. everything on the case is in Spanish or something. I haven't watched it yet so I dont know what language the movie is in. I hope its English.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a very fun game. It's really addicting!<br />Everyone can enjoy this game. It's worth downloading and giving it a try!
B00571F26Y|3.0|This book had an interesting perspective on health and weight loss.  There was a ton of research connecting wheat to common health issues that a lot of people face.  However all of the research made the book a bit long.  My biggest issue with the book is that I don think I can sustain this way of eating forever.  And my guess is once I slip the weight comes back :(  the author talks about not being able to eat regular cookies or treats again, and that simply isn't reality. The diet may work up front but if you don't stick with it you are probably right back where you started :(
B00CF34B2I|1.0|this app doesn't even download on my kindle fire!!! lame! don't waste your time if you have one :/ so disappointed...
B005544TRQ|5.0|sat down and watched 6 hours straight two days in a row. will watch season 3 when it comes out.
B001UW58YK|4.0|The previous DVD concert was light on music.  This has much more.  Michael is very professional and polished and works the audience.  For the first viewing the audience interaction is fun, the second time it is less interesting
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Such  great story of love and rewriting the past. Definitely a good read if you're looking for a tear jerker.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|This is a great performance, varied arrangements from the original recordings.  a very good female vocalist in the band.  Sting is one of the great talents who has continued to reinvent.
B004HD61KE|1.0|I think the book skipped around too much making it hard to tell who was who.  I will read it again this fall and it might appeal to me more.  You know when the air is cool and crisp and a warm blanket makes you feel like snuggling in.
B003Q97D48|5.0|I love this show and downloading the episode was very quick and easy. Thank You very much for the product.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The best tycoon game ever but I the prices are too high  needs to be cheap  and no vest point s that's lame
B0094M2Z9O|4.0|This movie was very good.  There were alot of twist in it.  You had to pay attention or you could get lost.  Alot of action.
0062255657|3.0|Good --- not great --- dark fantasy tale by the great Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is not a children's story.  Though it involves children and contains magical and fantastical elements similar to other YA stories (i.e. Harry Potter)it is intended for appreciation by adult readers.  A man returns to his childhood home and relives events that took place when he was 7 and his life was forever changed, and saved, by three special women who lived at the end of the lane.<br /><br />A short novel that is easily gobbled up in one sitting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a great game  l recommend it to everyone it is really  fun and you can get so far in the game you don't even know what is  going on.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My grankids love this movie so much that I purchased one for my home as well as one for down at the beach.
B00400NHRO|4.0|Entertaining. Educating. Words you hear frequently in a hospital. Spot on in some areas. Learn empathy care for yourself stay connected. Speak out at injustices..
B007V4530A|5.0|Excellent excellent book--for any public speaker, not just those preparing for a TED experience. Information is pared down to the nitty gritty, so your time is not wasted. It is a fast, easy read, chockful of clear guidance and honest advice. I've been public speaking for over 10 years and learned a TON from this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is fun they have the bad guys are creepers zombies skeletons spiders its fun you can make big house's small houses medium houses and all hope you have fun playing this
0307887448|4.0|Ready player one will not go down in history as great literature with Shakespeare, Melville, or Tolstoy. That being said, Ready Player One is a fun fun book. The Phantom Tollbooth for the 80s generation. An adventure that combines virtual reality with nostalgia. Part of the pleasure of this read is trying to \\"get the reference\\". If you woke up on Saturday morning to watch cartoons; if you remember when MTV actually played music and you collected quarters for the arcade, this book is for you.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|Watched the movie with my niece before going to see the new Monsters University... we both enjoyed this movie.  Very entertaining!
B0042J6VUS|1.0|It fell apart as soon as I tried to put the phone in, very flimsy, too small.  what a disappointment.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|.Pouch is a little tight, may loosen with time.Tool appears to be well made.Would recommend to friend. Second gerber.Wore out last one. Very pleased with purchase.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire HD. As stated above, it is better than the alarms pre-programmed in my phone (which actually isn't saying much, considering it is an old Samsung Acclaim) as well as my 7G iPod Classic. Granted, the one on my iPod is standard, and I can't get a different one, but this one is wonderful. I can and do set it so that the auto snooze and dismiss options are obsolete, and that, in order to actually dismiss it, I need to solve 3 math problems in the morning. The one recommendation I would make is when setting the days to go off, if it had options such as weekly, monthly, every day, so on and so forth, to make it a little more convenient. I love the fact that I can use whatever song, noise, etc., so as the alarms sound, as well as the crescendo option to ease me awake. Getting up is hard enough in the morning, without being jarred awake by an alarm clock.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|They really need to come up with something original. You should never mess with the old 1980's horror it was to good.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a lot of fun to play.  It can be enjoyed by the whole family and is very entertaining.
076115678X|5.0|This has a lot of great advice for women with curly hair. I didn't hate my hair in my youth like some of the &#34;confessions&#34; but always wanted more curls, more natural hair. Now I can. I have more options as well as healthier hair.
B00AN0KGWE|1.0|Honestly I think I should have just gotten the DVD's. Then I could watch them anywhere. It took up a LOT of space to download them. (frown)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed the surprise twists and turns.  My guess of \\"who done it\\" was so far off until the near end, and the ending of the book completely surprised me.  I guess you really can never be sure you know someone...
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Read the epilogue otherwise you will be disappointed!<br />Nicholas Sparks gas done it again, nos it's time to see the movie!
B0009VRHLK|1.0|not recommended.why waste a persons time with having this person got tricked into buying a hyped up version of a porn movie.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|With so much &#34;scary&#34; movies now and days, it's hard to find one that actually gets you off your feet. This one is quick on the scare instead of keeping you waiting for a whole minute just to make you jump when you clearly see what is coming. Evil Dead is a movie for everyone who wants to actually get scared and it gets you jumping when you least expect it. Must watch and I can guarantee that this movie will be worth it.<br />P.S. if your squeamish then avoid this movie at all cost.
034580709X|3.0|I never thought I'd give a Nesbo book less than 5 stars, but this one just seemed to drag. I've read this series starting at the newest and then ordering the earlier books as they became available in English.<br /><br />It is obvious that this is the author's first book. Harry is just not as interesting or convincing a character as he is in the later books (even in the second book).<br /><br />I found his romance in this volume to be irritating rather than endearing. The best part of the book is definitely his Aussie cop pal, Andrew. Also interesting is Harry's perspective and views on Australian culture. The portions of the book dealing with the indigenous issue in Australia are a bit ham-fisted, but kind of what you might expect coming from somebody from a homogeneous culture.<br /><br />Overall the book is fine and I'm very glad I read it because most of the latter books reference the Australian case and it is good to finally know what happened. Worth a read if you like this series.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I was able to play this on my kindle when I first downloaded it. Now I can't and I'm not very happy about that.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Pete weaves a wonderful and powerful story of his life and his beloved band. I am awed at the story of all his peers - great rockers from the 60 and 70 I can relate to. Brought you up to date today. Read and enjoy the trip back in time and understand life through his eyes. Who I am is for all believers, musicians and artist who have an idea and go for it.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|I very much enjoyed this movie as I wanted to see it before the new one came out and give me the background. Very well done in every way
B002OHN5NQ|4.0|Great quality shielding and plug.  The eyelets could be a bit more sturdy and designed to better accommodate for limited terminal space.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|I really like this app once you start to play you get toltaly engrossed and then you want to play the next puzzle. The longer you play you seem to try to want to see if you can find all of the numbers faster.
B002TOJHCM|4.0|Easy to use.. great tool.. my only objection is that I can not print anything out.. .. sometimes I just want the printed sheet , larger to read etc...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is proof that when everyone absolutely adores a book, there's probably a very good reason for it. Just ask the almost 60,000 ratings on Goodreads that average a remarkable 4.54 out of 5 stars. PROOF that it's amazing. And it's also proof that I never should have waited this long to read it. Silly me....<br /><br />\\"Sometimes discovering the truth can leave you more hopeless than believing the lies...\\"<br /><br />Sky knew very little about her past. She knew she was adopted at the age of 3 after the death of her birth mother, when her father was no longer able to take care of her on his own. She only had sporadic memories of her childhood. She was emotionally detached from everyone in her life, including boyfriends... or better termed hook-ups. Sky's mother despises technology, so Sky was at a loss for all things electric. No TV, no phone, no computer. Sky was also home-schooled her entire life, only attending public school for the first time her senior year of high school.<br /><br />Sky met Dean Holder by chance and was immediately unable to deny the attraction. Though he was known for his player-like ways, she found herself drawn to him. Sky and Holder's blossoming relationship was one of my favorite parts of this story. Though it did pick up on the quicker side, it was nothing like insta-love. It was so much more than that.  They had a strong bond that even I could feel.<br /><br />The realistic nature of this story was off the charts. I found myself going through almost every emotion imaginable while reading (errr... listening to) this story. The narrator was sensational, provoking endless feelings throughout the entire story. I really enjoyed the flashbacks, where Sky was a young girl. The narrator made those scenes pop, Sky being so naive and so pure as a child. The entire story was performed beautifully.<br /><br />I have to mention that although the characters are of high school age, some of the scenes in this story may be a bit hard to swallow. Though I think many youngsters will benefit from reading this story, some of it may be a bit much. Some of the scenes, though necessary to tell the story accurately, even made me a bit queasy.<br /><br />Full of laughs, swooning galore, and tons of tears, Hopeless will leave you reeling long after you've closed the cover. Warning: It's addicting and will have you up all hours of the night, unwilling to put it down. The good news... book 2 is out! Losing Hope, here I come! :)ugh I think many youngsters will benefit from reading this story, some of it may be a bit much.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe reader has been around a long time. And has been a great! I would recommend consumers to upgrade to latest version.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Great show! I've been wanting to see this series for quite some time because I've heard a lot of good things about it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great app that all android users should have. Raise dragons and have fun feeding them. Get your friends involved and get lots of gold. Just enjoy. Thanks, Eric Lewis
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I could not put this book down!!!  Truly one of the best books I have ever read. The story is compelling.  I highly recommend it.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I love TOM, my grand son showed me Tom. I love play with him, he is adorable!!<br /><br />Thank you<br />Anita
B005ARYEY6|3.0|The performances are good, but it is hard to hear the bass sometimes and with this improv style, the bass really holds down the harmonic framework. I still think it is worth having for Davis fanatics.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great for keeping up with the crazy Texas weather when I can't get to the tv or when the news isn't on.
0399143793|5.0|Lee Child & Jack Reacher never disappoint!! This purchase was to round out my hardback collection of one of my favorite authors.
B000001EGE|5.0|From the time you turn this one on......Honky Cat, Mellow, Rocket Man.....and of course the best NON HIT song of Elton's long career....Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.  This is easily one of the top five Elton albums of all time ranking with the likes of  Tumbleweed Connection, Madman Across the Water, Captain Fantastic and of course Yellow Brick Road......<br /><br />If you don't own this one, you owe it to yourself to enjoy one of pop music's greatest performers ever.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|I loved the concept and the graphics,but this game did not work on my Kindle Fire.I was very disappointed,because it would be one of the best games I've encountered had it worked on my device.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|sorry I don't get it,it's soooooooooooo lame if u want to get the app ok but u should get Dragon story way better than thin junk!!!!&gt;:(so u should get Dragon story:)=)thank u
B007FTZDN8|5.0|The format puts a new spin on dialog and information. If you find receiving much of interest (of course there is some) challenging from TV, then, try some TED for a change,
B000JMKTLO|1.0|I couldn't put down Gone Girl.  By contrast, i found the subject of this book just depressing. I suspect it is as well written, I just didn't like the topic/story.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|Has a sharp and humorous wit. After reading three of his books....it's time to move on. Give him a try
B002M9WW30|4.0|Love these movies and the quality is the best i have seen ever for these films...love that they have all of the movies and the bonus disc as well
B003SJ4VJ6|4.0|Add it to your queue - you will be glad you did.<br /><br />This is one of those films that doesn't get a lot of press and slips beneath the radar, I don't know why.<br /><br />We watch entertainment in a wilderness of Rated D for Dumb movies these days, but The Ghost Writer pegs an interesting story with great actors in different roles than you have come to expect.
B004HWYTP4|1.0|Unable to watch frequent loading, switched to Netflix no problem. Not sure if I will rent from amazon in the future.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill Climb is the best game ever! I'll be honest there are some things in there that I personally don't like by that is just my opinion. It's really entertaining and fun I think. I really enjoyed playing this game and you give it a try and see how much you like it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|she loves this show so much and watches the show over an over. I would say that makes this quite successful.
0345803493|4.0|The penultimate (I have always looks for a reason to use that word!) edition of this series is a decided improvement from the first book. Whereas the plot of the first is quite, quite...quite simple:  sex, sex, more sex, different kinds, in different places, inspiring assorted \\"growls\\", \\"whispers\\", \\"hard looks\\", etc.;  the second book introduces an actual plot - a stalker, a mild murder-mystery storyline, and Ana and Christian make some decisions about their future.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if the following annoyed you in the first book, it does not improve in the second:<br />-Ana's incredibly irritating inner goddess/subconscious gymnastics<br />-Christian's and/or Ana's \\"scowls\\", \\"whispers\\", \\"hard looks,\\" \\"glares\\", \\"peers.\\"<br />-Super cheesy inner (and outer) dialogue such as \\"Oh my\\" and \\"Oh Fifty\\"<br />-Everyone being so ridiculously in love with Ana while she remains completely obtuse about it (obviously because she has brown frizzy hair, the go-to physical trait of female protagonists that proves she isn't beautiful or least is unable to think she is)<br />-Christian being over-controlling and borderline mentally unstable<br /><br />However...and this is a big however, I am, somehow, invested in these characters and I can't wait for the final installment.  The thing is, I honestly can't really explain why.  I think, with these, the best course of action is to not overthink it...just submit to the addiction.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|no attachment. there is no pull to continue this story because there is no character that is loved. There is nothing but quick recalls of zombie attacks. boring.
1419702238|5.0|When my son heard of a new book in the series was coming out, he just had to have it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm not a critic, but I can say that this book was quite enjoyable. I enjoy the style that this author has and I will be reading more of his books.
0545323126|5.0|My son was a big fan of the series in 2nd grade.  He read one of the books at school and wanted to read the rest, and he had to have the collection of books to keep.  Even though he finished the series long ago, he still reads to this day!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love facebook because its very fun and amusing really amazing and helps me do what i need to do to be myself
B006WPWH4E|3.0|Not crazy about it.  Could just be used to the other one I was using on my computer.  Kept it but do not use it often.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love to play this game! And I love all of the talking apps if I could I would download all of them!!!!
0985557834|5.0|I have been a paracord hobbyist for a few years now, and I have purchased all 3 of JD Lenzen's books on fusion knotting to date.  It is clear that the three books are written in a progression for a reason; the project ideas in this book are more challenging than many of the projects in the other books, but also more useful.  The book is beautifully illustrated, and as always, instructions are clear.  I am looking forward to attempting several of the projects in the book in the coming weeks before school starts again, so if anything changes I will revise my review.<br /><br />The best part of using JD's books is if you ever get stuck you can go straight to his YouTube video and it will help you immensely.  I have found so many more uses for paracord since subscribing to his channel, and have gotten several ideas for uses from his work.
1601251505|5.0|It is as good if not better than DnD v 3.5. Very easy to pick up and teach to new players. My friends and I have had the same characters for a couple of years now and I always look forward to playing this. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to start into the RPG scene.
B00CATSONE|5.0|It is nice to know that to be a genius takes work and it is not inherited!  I love the way they have tested the genius factor and how people get it.
B000SEJHRA|1.0|Want to read a poorly thought out book with no regard for storyline, plot, tempo or humor? Have that special someone in your life that annoys the heck out of you; talks incessantly and sucks the life out of you? Well, then this is the book for you/them!As for myself, I just want a refund of the time and money spent waiting for this book to be funny or interesting.<br /><br />David Sederis` genius lies not in his writing or humor but in his ability to sell such poorly formed drivel. At best he is Tom Sawyer getting us to do his bidding, more likely he is a modern literary PT Barnum. This book was a three ring circus of bad acts; exploited characters and poor showmanship minus the peanuts and popcorn.
0802473156|5.0|I have read other books by Gary Chapman, who I love as an author.  My sister had mentioned that she wanted to read this certain book, so found it online and ordered it as a birthday gift.  She is enjoying reading this book. Thank you!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book rocked. Recommend to anyone who likes adventure. Saw the movie before the book. Loved the book so much more.

B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I wonder if anyone else who has purchased the Season 3 UK Version of Downton Abbey has had any problems with playback?  On the first copy that I received, the first episode on each of the three disks showed Laura Linney's introduction and the ads for Ralph Lauren and Viking River Cruises.  Then the screen went black and subsequently recovered to the Main Menu with the highlight on the second episode on the disk.  Attempting to watch the first episode through the Scene Selection option also yielded disappointing results.  The first scene gave the same result as trying to play the episode from the Main Menu.  However, by starting the episode at the second scene, I was able to watch the episode minus the first scene.<br /><br />I notified Amazon that there was a problem and they sent a new set of disks promptly.  Guess what?  The same problem exists on the replacement disks.  Has anyone else seen this problem?????
B0090SI42Y|3.0|This movie is average at best. Within the 1st 15 minutes I knew two things: The RZA can't act or direct. His writing wasn't that bad at all  but he should have started his directorial debut with something smaller. One more thing, the special features on this Blu-Ray suck. The deleted scenes were pitiful wastes of time and the \\"behind the scenes\\" bits were useless. If you decide to buy this Blu-Ray wait until it goes on sell.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|A fantastic continuance of the series! As always it is hard to put down. Great writing and plenty of action.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|Been waiting for them to get their act together, and this album heads in the right direction. Hate the loss of GT, but the musical core is still there. Now if we can get DeGarmo back into the fold!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The story is classically interesting with a grungy otherworldly landscape. Amazing amount of strife to arrive at the beginning of a story. Can't wait until the next one.
B004W4N55C|3.0|This is a really useful app for the guitar player. My only issue is that I now have this app with the tools and another UG app with the tab packs. I can either pay another $3.99 for these tools again or go back and forth between the two apps. Very frustrating.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|This book is one of the best of th  Alex Rider series! Anthony Horowitz an amazing job on wrapping the series with Scropia Rising!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had a blast playing this game. My only problem is that I'd love a few more chapters. Excellent work!<br />I did notice one small bug however. A few times I lost the ability to tap on anything after pausing the game. Closing and opening the game back up always made it work again without losing my progress.
0802473156|4.0|This book was okay, I liked it enough but it was not overly great. In reading the love languages it does help you to understand your partner better but most individuals will already know their own love language. I do not necessarily think this is a must read, but more so a great conversation starter for married couples or couples thinking about taking the next step. This is a good guide to understanding if you're willing to do what it takes to stay married.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My child and I both love this game  cause its better than all the other run games. Animation is spectacular the music and sound effects make everyone laugh and it never crashes. seems like endless levels too
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Go back to the old version, please!  It was much better than this new version.  Much easier to access the forecast for the different cities in which I am interested.  Thanks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had been planning to get this for a while now. I used  to always play this at my friends house and I finally got it. AMAZING. Definitely a must get.
B0056BMK6K|3.0|The book was okay.  I had already heard a lot of the same tactics he used from other books I've read about publishing on Kindle.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am the type of reader who will usually only fill my plate with happy endings and positivity. This is one of the only books that I felt truly brilliant in its heart wrenching honesty. I read a few words and was hooked. I can not put into words how it touched me and changed me, but would highly recommend it. I think it takes bravery to read this. I know for myself once I began, I could not stop myself from pressing onward. It reminds me of how you feel after a pent up really emotional hard cry, afterwards the release feels good in the exhaustion, but it was painful getting there.
B003N0XDT4|2.0|I purchased the FiiO E7 six months ago and it worked flawlessly (and quite impressively I might add) for about 4 of those months. The past 2 months however, the unit has refused to output audio to the right channel of any audio system / headphones when connected to my computer via USB DAC. I researched the issue online and found this to be a common issue among users of the E7. So I contacted FiiO directly and they agreed to fix or replace the unit if they thought necessary on one condition: I cover the shipping of the unit to their headquarters in China, which translates to $104 out of my pocket to ship this device that is not even half way through its warranty period. So now I'm stuck with a device that only functions as a headphone amplifier  via 3.5 to 3.5mm connection, and it has a non-functioning DAC portion for which I primarily purchased this unit. FiiO, don't expect to see me in your customer base in the future.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This was just a fun joy ride - i LOVED what RED stands for!<br />I look forward to becoming one myself! :D
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|Scary, eye opening documentary. A must see!<br />Shipping was faster, than I thought it would be. DVD condition, excellent! Great overall experience.
0876855575|4.0|I've owned this book for years... and for years its yellow spine stared out at me from the bookshelf desperately wanting to know when it would finally be its turn to be read. I don't know why I never got around to it, and I'm not sure why I finally did, but I am glad that I did. Not least because it makes me happy to be able to finish a book in a day!<br /><br />This is the first I've read of Bukowski... I may have been skeptical at first due to the my perceived notion of him as a trendy writer, but my fears were quickly and easily assuaged as the accessible yet meaningful prose pulled me into the details of a life far removed from my own. Both the style and the layout made this novel incredibly easy to read. I find it nearly impossible to put down a book when the next chapter is rarely longer than 4 pages, but this story flowed so smoothly I doubt I would have noticed had it been one long paragraph.<br /><br />I felt, at first, as though I was watching someone's story unfold through the haze of a scarcely remembered dream. As time passed and pages turned the picture begin to crystalize, and that clarity turned the almost comical nature of the early characterizations into hard-chiseled reality. A reality I could never hope to truly understand but one that made me believe it was my own. At least for a time. I could feel the alienation with which Bukowski dealt from the very earliest memories. The ostracization by classmates, neighbors, and even parents hit home, and I was there. I felt the loneliness, I felt the apathy, I felt the hopelessness, and I felt the daydreams. I remembered what it was like to be downtrodden and depressed. I remembered what it was like to think my way out of it with dreams of the future, and I remembered the fleeting joy of temporary success. I know what it's like to drown in a bottle, I know what it's like to feel poor, and I know that, to Bukowski, I would have been one of the people he hated. Now I know what those feelings are all like from an entirely different point of view.<br /><br />More impressive than his ability to evoke feeling, however, was that I never felt force fed the unfortunate circumstances of his life. In fact, except for the rarest of moments, I felt a sense of pride emanating from this man. He refused to be a victim of those circumstances. He refused to be a victim at all. It was not overt, and I don't think he was proving a point. I was just a lucky observer watching a masterful storyteller unfold the details of his life for anyone who cared to look.<br /><br />We are all products of our experiences, our circumstances, our time, and our geography. What makes us all different is how we combine these things to become who we are and who we are supposed to be. It was uplifting to watch this sad tale unfold and watch this man own who he was, where he came from, and where he believed he was going. There is no golden moral here. There is no happily ever after. He simply walks away with little emotion and no fanfare. This story does not end - it is a beginning. I think it is a testament to Bukowski's ability to weave a narrative that I want to know what happens next... but I don't need to. I am satisfied with the non-ending ending, and I am more at peace with who I am and who I will become.<br /><br />Although I'd really like to drink a bottle of wine now.om an entirely different point of view.<br /><br />More impressive than his ability to evoke feeling, however, was that I never felt force fed the unfortunate circumstances of his life.

B00594XOZU|1.0|ive been trying to download this and threes a pop up on my Kindle Fire saying error try again, but it wont work. I've downloaded other apps and they're working fine has this ever happenwd to anyone? tell me what to do please!
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|The author has a bad attitude, and it shows.  This book is awful.  Which means it's great.  But it's awful.
B00B05Z77U|5.0|Purchased as a gift.  Book was in perfect condition, and the person for whom it was purchased was delighted with it.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|If you're thinking of buying this book because you absolutely loved the Netflix series, save your money. The first 20 pages are similar to the series. After the book is only useful as a sleep aid. The show is witty and funny and most of all interesting. This book is not. The author has no idea how to write and never misses a chance to tell you how amazing and popular she  is. I wasted 12 bucks and several hours on this book.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|i love the book, the story and the price was really good can't wait to read the rest of the series
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved the app for years.  The latest upgrade makes it completely worthless.  The greatest asset TWC has is their 36 hour forecast - and they completely dropped it!
B009MO5ES8|5.0|This movie is awesome. I have seen nothing like this movie before. and that's what was exciting about it. there are not to many movies about bike messengers. it is fast paced and the stunts were amazing. and the movie had a good plot and story as well. joseph Gordon levit was a perfect choice for his part and so was michale Shannon they bothe were awesome. this is a great movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a nice app. I don't like the way the energy works and how much it costs to get more. Otherwise it works very well.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I love how these sound! While not noise cancelling, they still block out much sound. Only issue is they are not as comfortable as the Bose Triport headphones I had many years ago but are much more affordable.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It was hard getting to the link and getting it downloaded. The path was confusing but now that I can read my books I am happy.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Had 3 different head phones to choose from over a year ago when I bought this & one other, plus the Sony Walkman came with a set. These are so light and comfortable that you probably won't realize you have them on if you turn off the radio, and they had clearly the best sound of the 3.  My wife uses them every day, and sometimes snags the wire, but they continued to work until today.<br />The only problem with them now is there is an intermittent connection to the left speaker. I can tape the wire in a position where they still work, but at this price, I'm going to replace them with the same item.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie choked me up in the end. It's now probably my favorite batman movie, tied with the 89 movie as well as the other two Nolan adventures. What a classic with a great story.
B009X011UQ|5.0|I really like this case, it is a perfect fit, it protects from minor chips or scratches, it has a nice easel back, easy to fold over the screen, easy to fold to the back, and you can access all of the ports for charging, headphones, etc. with the case on.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|I bought these as a Potter fan and wondered how the quality would be.  It's great! Especially when compared to wacthing these movies on TV where they're typically too dark to make things out in the film.  We're up to the Half-Blood Pronce and they've all been excellent quality so far.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Could not put it down. My iPad ran out of power every night until this book was finished. Big fan.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|this game is one of my favorite games on my kindle! I recommend this game to everybody. enjoy the game! but just to let you know, its kinda easy so if your looking for a challenge search temple run on the appstore.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Fun &amp; easy to learn. I'm not a kid &amp; I'm kind of addicted! Play for 2 minutes or an hour, either way you're leveling up.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Emma Chase, where in the Drew Evans did you come from?? Simply fantastic debut. Loved the voiceover-esque male POV.<br /><br />I have been busy the past few weeks recommending this to all of my girlfriends. Pick this one up.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Bought this for a great price, and love this family movie. Great for all ages with a powerful message. I highly recommend anyone to watch it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game for Kindle Fire. I enjoyed it very much and I use my Kindle primarily for reading but this was an exceptional puzzle. I will get the sequel without question.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really cool game I 'm glad I got it. It's like taking care of real horse . It's just awesome but I wish I really did have a real one so, I could have a friend for a horse and call him Tammen.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Married women, all mothers, have been disappearing from Oslo, oddly enough when it snows. Harry and new partner Katrine Bratt are called out to one such case, and a day or two later, yet another. Large snowmen have sprung up at each site, maker unknown, each with some \\"momento\\" from the victim. But there's little other evidence, and Harry's skills - and emotions- are about to be severely tested.<br /><br />The integrity of novels written in other languages depends on the proficiency of the translator, and Don Bartlett knows his stuff. (It goes without saying that the author does too!) This is an intricate plot, relying on flashbacks and multiple points of view. There is also a plethora of suspects, each of whom seems guilty until single details rule them out. Translating characters must be even more complex. Though Harry is an modern archetype, the others are not, and Bartlett seems to have spanned the cultural gap and its nuances quite well. The Snowman is loaded with suspenseful sequences, and although the flashbacks are occasionally a bit confusing, the novel as a whole does not suffer. And its ending, satisfying (and horrific) in itself, leaves the reader wondering what's next for Harry. Whatever comes next, it's probably far from simple....
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is good for when you are not near a TV  so, you can hear on your Android. Thank You.
B001P06GX4|5.0|this is a game to make my kids think they have so much fun  my kids love it. no regrets
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a great game if you like to do the game the game youself. I enjoy it a lot.
0425267695|5.0|this book was worth the wait. amazing plot, one of the best I have read. can't wait for the next book.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This movie is a timeless classic. I love watching it with my grand children. And yes I still enjoy it to.
B00009P1O2|5.0|An active an talented showman with his equally talented band. This should be saved forever and live forever, this world has only one sweet moment set aside for us!
0670014893|3.0|I love Le Carre and can't say I regretted reading his most recent.  But it falls far short of the truly great ones.  We all know the author's politics, and it would be far better if he put them aside and concentrated on writing a really good story.
B009DH372Y|5.0|An active an talented showman with his equally talented band. This should be saved forever and live forever, this world has only one sweet moment set aside for us!
B004Z4M15Y|5.0|How did I pass this one by for so long?  Amazing writing.  Caused me to put my own novel down for at least a bit.  How could I equal this?
0345535421|5.0|I have read many works of epic fantasy, including Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy that started it all, but I think there is nothing quite like George R.R. Martin's SONG OF ICE AND FIRE series, of which CLASH OF KINGS is the second installment.  What sets Martin's work apart: he writes epic fantasy for adults with a minimum of emphasis on magic and the supernatural.  There are no cute little Hobbits, noble Knights on a quest, virginal princesses or wise old wizards to be found anywhere in Martin's books.  Instead, his characters are filled with lust, have sex frequently, and are driven by motives that are far from pure.  There is no Sauron like embodiment of evil, only very human and very flawed people, some much more sympathetic than others, but that is the genius of Martin's writing, for even the minor players in this drama are well fleshed out and the reader fully understands why they do the things they do.<br /><br />CLASH OF KINGS picks up right where GAME OF THRONES left off: the kingdom of Westeros has been thrown into bloody civil war in the wake King Robert's death and the execution of Eddard Stark by the boy king, Joffrey.  Robert's brothers, Stannis and Renley each claim the throne while Eddard's son, Robb, has proclaimed himself King in the North.  All of them must fight each other and with the House of Lannister, the late King Robert's in-laws.  There is much conniving, back stabbing, murdering, torturing, avarice and harrowing cruelty as everyone wars against everyone else for the prize of setting upon the Iron Throne.<br /><br />I think CLASH OF KINGS, along with the rest of Martin's books gives us a picture of what civilization would have looked like if there had been no Jesus Christ (or Mohammad or Buddha for that matter).  People worship pagan Gods who are distant and uncaring, all the while acting out of pure self interest and desire for power.  Some of the Lannisters would have made Nietzsche blush.  There is loyalty and love for family and tribal bonds are strong, but no one in the ruling houses of Westoros appear to have the slightest notion of the common good.  Hatred and revenge rule the hearts here, even the hearts of children.<br /><br />All the people we loved from GAME OF THRONES are back again, including Tyrion Lannister, who has the thankless job of being the Hand of the King to his vile nephew, Joffrey; Arya Stark, who is still on the run from the Lannisters and making a list of all the people she will kill to avenge her father; Jon Snow, who ventures beyond the Wall in the North and finds a new threat gathering in the cold and icy forests; Daenerys Targaryen, the Mother of Dragons, who wanders in the South in search of allies to bring down all the ruling houses of Westeros.  There are some welcome additions in CLASH OF KINGS: Brienne of Torth, the woman warrior, and Qhorin Halfhand, who saves Jon Snow's life at great cost to himself.  My own personal favorites are Bran Stark and the Hound, two characters whose fates take interesting turns.<br /><br />At nearly a thousand pages, CLASH OF KINGS is truly epic in length, but Martin's writing makes the pages fly by; his fantasy world comes alive in rich detail along with the people who live there, often using simple descriptive phrases i.e. \\"he was all scowls and jowls.\\"  Harrenhal and Winterfell are as real to the reader as the street they live on.  Is there a twist in CLASH OF KINGS to equal the beheading of Eddard Stark in GAME OF THRONES?  Yes there is, but keep reading, for all is not as it seems.<br /><br />If you've just watched the HBO series, then you are doing yourself a disservice, read the books that started it all, they are well worth the considerable investment of time.ibal bonds are strong, but no one in the ruling houses of Westoros appear to have the slightest notion of the common good.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautifully done series. Interesting story line, great character development. We're so glad we're Amazon Prime members, and can't wait for streaming of Season 4!
0062255657|5.0|It was absolutely above and beyond my expectations. I thought it was perfectly marvelous. 10/10 would recommend to anyone as everyone
B00DU74U74|5.0|I loved this movie! Not quite like the book but as a seperate entity it was really good. The movie was recieved quickly onto my Roku and I was able to watch the movie instantly.
B007SGM084|5.0|One of the best books ever I could read this over and over. I hope yo see more from E L James
0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is the first novel Neil Gaiman has written for adults in quite a while, and even though the book is relatively short, it was well worth the wait. It's essentially a fairy tale for adults, and as any good fairy tale should, it contains elements of magic and fantasy, along with things that are most comfortable in the dark.<br /><br />The narrator is a man, whose name I don't believe is ever revealed in the story, who has come back to Sussex, England where he grew up, to attend a funeral for someone close to him. After the service, as people are mulling around comforting each other, he's pulled enigmatically back to the property near where the house he grew up once stood. On that property is a small duck pond he's drawn to and as he's there, memories of his childhood and events that took place involving that pond begin to come back to him.<br /><br />The pond is on the property owned by the Hempstocks, three generations of women who live there still and who he now remembers saved his life when he was a young boy. When he was seven he met Lettie Hempstock who told him she was eleven, but would not answer his question of how many years she had been eleven. He was somehow able to tell at the time that she had been eleven for longer than he had been alive.<br /><br />On the night a lodger staying at the narrator's home commits suicide in their family car, Lettie takes the young narrator somewhere no normal human should ever be allowed to go. When they return, they're both unaware that a dark and dangerous power has hitched a ride with the boy. That power takes the shape of Ursula Monkton, who bewitches the rest of the boy's family but who terrorizes him. His only hope is the Hempstock women and the unworldly powers they possess.<br /><br />It's a great story told by a fantastic writer. Gaiman possesses two qualities that make him one of the best at what he does: a tremendous imagination and the ability to tell a story in such a way as to communicate far more than what he puts down in words. Every time I've read something written by him, whether it's a graphic novel, children's picture book, short story or full length novel, I feel like I've just been told the most fascinating story I've ever heard.
080508990X|5.0|great book for kids, I started reading it to my son and even after 2 years having it, he enjoys learning with it
B00CKQ1092|4.0|I love this band and everything they have ever done! This album is a bit lighter than the previous ones but it still manages to leave me feeling pretty good!!
B004TTHLBE|3.0|Not as good as other books by<br />Neil Gaiman. I was waiting for something to happen the whole book. The main character is pleasant though.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|Different than the first one. Enjoyed seeing updated actors in this fun movie. I would have like the main character to be unpacked more about his relationship with his mom, lots of talk but not a lot of emotion.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is great for connecting with your friends who have a smartphone or tablet such as Androids, iPhones, Kindles, Blackberries and more. Except I have noticed that this app is different from the one that is in the Google Play Store but it still works.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|I loved the movie. It was very exciting and well done. Acting and war scenes were well very real and well done
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just like having a house except without the real mess smell and price! My kids love it and stopped bothering me about getting a real one.... for now. All in all a really fun app#
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|A little hard to follow at times and but a great movie and a bonafied classic. Lots of classic lines and memorable performances.
0439023513|3.0|Not as good as the first two books in the trilogy, but at least it brings the trilogy to a fitting end. If you've read the first two and liked them, you'll want to see how the story ends.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|I pre-ordered the CD as soon as I heard about this album. Today is the release date and I listened to it the first time....it's wonderful. If you like Guy Clark, there is nothing more that needs to be said.
0425263924|5.0|I loved the 3rd book of the Crossfire series by Sylvia Day.  I thought that the series was complete with the 3rd book and was disappointed and excited to find out that there will be 2 more books.  Anxiously waiting.....
1936608898|5.0|I saw a blogger talk about her Whole 30 experience and it sparked my interest. I bought the book and gave it a go. I don't have any health concerns so my main motivation was to fit into my &#34;skinny&#34; jeans and back into some work pants that haven't fit right over the last year. WOW! I lost about 18 lbs and it was relatively easy! It's been a month since my Whole 30 month and I still look and feel great. All of my friends have asked about it and 3 of them have been motivated to try it with similar results. I highly recommend this program. I never thought I ate poorly, but after reading this book and cutting out foods that weren't &#34;good&#34; for me, I realized just how those foods made my body feel and how easy it was to cut them out. I CAN say no to the unlimited amounts of candy at my office and you can too! :)

B00DYEN5QU|2.0|No story no humour no beacon of light just darkness like being sucked into a black hole. Superman movies have always been good because clark/superman was the best of two worlds good hearted, naive,funny and altruistic to a fault. Everything we wish our world could be so we escape to this  fictional world to laugh and cheer.  This movie is so dark i think reality is brighter ,they took everything we know from past movies twisted and contorted to the point it's not even superman.  More like darkman this movie makes returns look like a academy award winner. Brandon Routh was much better true to spirit of Christopher Reeve and superman movies of the past. Dissappointing
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My nephew got me hooked after watching him play. So I downloaded it on my kindle fire. Works great! Glitch free, awesome graphics, highly addictive. Must I say more?
B001F3FUK6|4.0|This movie is much better because its closer to its roots routh looks like reeve about same height n weight cavil is about 3 inches shorter. Also in man of steel they completely change story lois knows from beginning he's superman there's really only one real action scene with zod rest of the time hes just conflicted. He learns how to use his power n fly as adult when he first wheres cape dumb. Superman had no charm or real interaction with people,  Everything pretty much happen in his hometown not metropolis. To me wb dropped the ball they turned superman into batman to dark.
1451695195|4.0|I have worked in the medical field for most of my careers and met many physicians. I am so pleased Dr. Alexander has written about his spiritual experience. His profession adds credibility, although there will continue to be the naysayers, I for one am thrilled to see what I and many others believe in writing from a Neurosurgeon. We are spiritual beings! My only criticism is religions do not play a part of the spiritual experience, they are man made, fear based and controlling. True spirituality is true freedom and love. Highly recommend!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have used many white noise apps, but White Noise has been the best.  Not only does it have a large selection of sounds but it also has many features, such as a clock, wake timer, and an auto shut off feature.  The best thing is that I can have the sounds playing while I read a book.  The best thing about this app though is how efficient it is.  Unlike many other white noise apps this app does not take a toll on your battery, a big plus IMHO.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is very very fun, its actually really addicting!! I once played it for 2hours straight!! I would recommend this app to anyone. Its a great time waster and consumer! Why are you still reading this!!???? The 1st sentence shouldve convinced you to get it already!!!!!! Now go download it!!!!!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I love the game but there are ads for lorn and they should warn people and kids might see that like me and its just gross but still the game is awesome
B000002P72|5.0|As Andres Segovia is to Classical Guitar, B.B. King is to Electric Blues Guitar and this album presents him in top form.
B00D6SBOWG|2.0|Love the game but it won't play on my Kindle Fire!  Please fix this because it's a great game! The other solitaire game quits after just one life so I want this one pleads.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a good workout.  It's not insane nor extreme.  But it covers all the bases and it's quick!  You won't think it's easy and you can adjust the weights you use.  You just need some dumbbells and a floor mat.  It's quick and effective.  I don't do it everyday, as recommended but it suits me well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and enjoyable game.I can't wait for the new puzzles, which I suspect will prove to be even more challenging.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Great character development and a rollicking adventure that uses the viehicle of fiction to explore the behaviours and motivations of people throuout human history.
B005MLP71Y|4.0|Bee Movie was our first instant movie purchase & we watched it with our 4 & 2 year old boys for our first ever movie night.  It was a great choice!  To shorten this review due to limited time, I'll just point out the negatives.  I was shocked with how many adult references there were.  I don't mind as an adult, but didn't like the extreme amount for my little ones.  For the most part, the main bee (Jerry Seinfeld's voice) was pretty positive & strong - good characteristics for growing minds to see.  I recommend this movie to all!
1419705644|5.0|Fun little book, especially for the price.<br />Pretty much a huge mash up of all of the characters written by Hunson Abadeer (Marceline's Father). It's pretty entertaining to read it from his perspective, but what really makes it is various characters throughout the show have scribbled along the pages of what they think of the entries and it makes it hilarious. It contains various pictures and isn't to complicated so I'd assume it'd be great for children or just fans of the show in general. I wish I had more time at the moment to write a proper review so I'll just say if you like Adventure Time, you'll probably find this book very entertaining, or just plain mathematical. (:
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I play this game all of the time. I even have it on my phone, but for some reason the official Big Duck Games version isn't available on my HTC. So I mostly play on the Kindle Fire.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|If Sean Carroll had a fan club, I'd be a member.  While serving a mission for our church in Samoa, I ordered and watched his &#34;The Great Courses&#34; lectures on &#34;The Physics of Time&#34; and &#34;Dark Matter - Dark Energy&#34;.  They were magnificent.  His approach is open and his knowledge is expansive.  As a guy who has made his living in front of audiences all over the world doing seminars, I was grateful for a presenter who made his 'show' about the subject matter - not about himself.<br /><br />I found this book to have the same open-ness - lots of knowledge presented for me to mull over and lots of learning to be learned.  I am grateful to really good teachers, and Dr Carroll is certainly that.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|I think this season really got back to what was great about Pre-Ireland Sons. Great action, and the plot with Tara and Piney is pretty chilling. The acting of Ron Perlman as Clay is superb.
B005FLVR7E|1.0|There are illustrations needed to understand portions of this book.  I (wrongly) assumed that an illustrated version would include those diagrams, etc.  It does not.  Instead, there is a stock photo at the end of each chapter showing the English countryside.  To call this &#34;illustrated&#34; based on that is false and misleading.
B006BXTOFC|3.0|I know that this is a band with a rabid fan base that will defend them when someone doesn't &#34;love&#34; them. I really enjoyed their previous albums, I just find this one to be leaning too much toward radio style rock and not the same.
B008J34466|5.0|I'm a pink fan through and through, so I really loved this album.  It had your rock anthems as well as your soulful songs. Pink always gets me Hype.
B001PO53IO|5.0|I have been watching this show since day one. I love being able to see the adventures of Anakin, Obi-Wan and company during the times they weren't on the big screen.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|A very good book, that is a dive into the distorted mind of a man on the edge. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and then some. Into engages you and you become apart of the story, every time you read it becomes like looking through window. Once you begin it is nearly impossible to put down. The diary style of writing with the added commentary of the very characters involved mesh together immaculately. Five stars completely. Finished it in two days.<br /><br />If you have ever read scar tissue by Anthony Kiedas I highly recommend this book.
B005HSL626|4.0|I used to play this game constantly on my phone. When my Droid broke I had to go back to an older android that doesn't support this game. When I found it on the Kindle Fire, I just had to play it. The game is just as good as I remember, but the Kindle isn't the best platform to play it on.
B000V39KDO|5.0|We might as well just have bought or buy this movie. My son has seen this numerous times and just loves it.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|The second season of SoA is just as good as the first. I really enjoyed the Zobelle storyline and wish they would revisit it at some point. Henry Rollins is great as a creep and the finale of this season will have you on the edge of your seat.
0439023491|5.0|I loved this book.  It grabbed my attention from the beginning and I can't wait to finish the next one.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire. I love this app because it not only lets me read PDF files but it allows me to take advantage of interactive checklists for video games. Helps me to keep track of missions and collectibles.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Fantastic book could not put it down. Traps was truly a genius that did not get the credit he deserved.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|To some this may be an acquired taste but I love tis show. Loaded with drama, action, and plenty of awesome stunts. This season started with a bang (literally) and just keeps getting better from here.

B001GQSY64|3.0|This movie wasn't nearly as good as the show, but it was a respectable lead-in. I found Asokha to be an annoying character but the show definitely rectifies this.

1476715904|4.0|You guys know by now that I don't normally have much luck with new adult novels.  So far I've liked about 2 of the ones that I've read.  I had almost given up hope when I was told that I had to read Slammed.  I figured I'd give it a shot but I didn't have very high expectations.  While I'm still not in love with the genre, Slammed is a wonderful book and has made me think twice about giving up altogether.<br /><br />The characters were by far my favorite part of Slammed.  Layken started off a bit whiny and I wasn't sure how I was going to like her but that didn't last long.  I quickly grew to really love her even when she whined. She was a girl I could easily see myself befriending.  Speaking of befriending though, her best friend Eddie, was by far the best.  She had a tough life but she didn't let it bring her down.  She was quirky and crazy but so much fun.  Then there's the boy.  Oh boy.  Will was amazing.  He was sweet, smart, funny, and a great brother.  His relationship with his little brother was one of the most attractive things about him.  He did have flaws though.  He was stubborn and that stubbornness really screwed things up with him and Layken.  I couldn't fault him though since it was clear to see where he was coming from.  There's also Layken's family which consists of her mom and her little brother.  Their family was far from perfect but that was what made them so real.  Layken's mom was always there for her and her little brother was so great.  I loved the family dynamics not just with them but also with Will and his brother.<br /><br />The story had a few predictable moments for me but it wasn't enough to make me dislike the book.  The secret that tears Will and Layken apart completely took me by surprise although to be honest, I should have seen it coming.  There were some signs leading up to the big reveal that should have given it away but I'm glad it didn't.  I liked that mystery.  That's not the only secret though.  Layken's family has some secrets of their own and those were the ones that were a bit predictable.  Don't worry though, you'll still really enjoy the story and you will devour it.  It's such a quick read.<br /><br />The romance might have been my favorite part though.  Especially all the tension between Will and Layken!  Things started off a little quickly for them but their relationship did eventually slow down and that's when readers really get to see how perfect they are for each other.  Sure there might have been a little insta-love at first but it's not too bad.  It's not the beginning of their relationship that really matters though.  It's how it progresses throughout the book that really matters.  It's so fabulous.<br /><br />Overall, Slammed has given me a new take on new adult.  I will definitely continue with this trilogy and I highly recommend starting it if you haven't already.crets of their own and those were the ones that were a bit predictable.

0062014536|4.0|I was very hesitant to read Requiem.  I had an ARC for months before it came out but I just couldn't force myself to read it.  All I had seen was pretty bad reviews and I just didn't want to end up hating the final book in a trilogy that I adored.  Finally though I couldn't put it off any longer.  While I didn't love it nearly as much as the first two books, I was happy with how things ended and I felt that everything tied up nicely.<br /><br />Requiem was a very slow read for me.  After devouring the first two books, I expected to do the same with this one.  That was not the case.  Things progressed very slowly and I found my attention wandering while reading.  There's more buildup than actual action in Requiem and I was most disappointed with that.  The revolution has arrived!  Why isn't anyone actually doing anything though?  Don't expect to be on the edge of your seat with this one.<br /><br />I was also really disappointed with the whole love triangle aspect of this book.  Really, I was disappointed with it for the whole trilogy.  I understood Alex and Lena's relationship in the first book and I loved it.  When the second book came out I didn't know what to expect based on the ending of the first book.  I was really upset when some new guy was introduced and we were expected to believe that Lena was in love with him and not Alex anymore.  It just didn't work for me.  With Lena's personality, her reluctance for her relationship with Alex, and so on, I just didn't see it as realistic.  I really didn't get it in Requiem.  Lena came across as this insecure girl who couldn't stand on her own two feet and instead needed a man to help her with everything.  Then of course there was Alex.  He's not the same Alex from the first book, that's for sure, but boy did I still love him.  Julian just never did it for me and no matter what I'm team Alex all the way.<br /><br />Lucky for me, Lauren Oliver's fabulous writing really held the book together and made me continue reading. I could quote this whole book to you guys, it's just so gorgeous.  Lauren Oliver manages to take a completely bleak and almost hopeless world and make it beautiful.  I adore that about her writing.<br /><br />As for the ending, I know that's what I was really worried about when I started Requiem.  While I admit it was a little abrupt, I felt that everything readers needed to know was included in the book and to me, the ending was pretty much perfect.  It's a very open ended ending, that's for sure, but in this case, there's nothing wrong with that.  Also, no matter what anyone says, Lena definitely made her choice as to which guy she was really in love with.  It wasn't a huge focal point at the end but it came across very clear to me and I really don't see how people think she didn't choose.  I was more than satisfied with the way this trilogy ended.<br /><br />Overall, while not perfect, Requiem was a good ending to the Delirium trilogy and I really do think fans will enjoy it.g.

0345803450|3.0|Positives<br />- The premise of an undercover mission regarding something literary had promise- a spy book about novel writing was something to get excited about.<br />- Haley's stories were quite interesting (dare I say more so than the actual novel?)<br />- McEwan's style was generally present, although not in tip-top shape<br />- I liked Serena, the main character- I appreciated her personality, mistakes, and spark.<br />- Great time period!<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- The ending was horribly predictable<br />- At times I had to really push myself to get through the book; there were some definite lulls<br />- Considering it dealt with the MI5 I thought it would be a little more exciting. Granted I know that most government offices do more paper pushing than anything else, I just hoped there would be more danger and intrigue.<br /><br />Sweet Tooth is definitely not McEwan's best; I've read Atonement, Solar, Saturday, and On Chesil Beach and think this was probably the weakest.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I first saw Skyfall in the movies and thoroughly enjoyed it. Daniel Craig is such a good Bond. Before Craig there was Connery and he has always been Bond to me. Daniel Craig is level pegging with Connery in terms of character portrayal - from me that is praise indeed! Added to his performance is a really good story (been a long time waiting for one) and overall a no-brainer - if you like Bond or action or both, this is for you. I just hope that the team of writers of the new Bond stories can keep up this high level. It looks like Mr Craig has got quite a few more Bond movies in him yet.

B00A8ECU24|3.0|Based on other people's reviews, I'm only giving this 3 stars... I had no idea it cost actual money to finish it, but I now think that it is probably driven by corporate greed of a big name company.. I also noticed that in order to buy canterlot ponies it is extremely expensive!! I mean seriously, I noticed there were ponies costing over 75,000 bits, and that feels like your trying to bribe them... also, many of the ponies have the same hairstyles as the mane six, and have generic and bland poses and stuff.. nevertheless I believe you should get this game as it is extremely cute and and fun for all ages &gt;-&lt; o.-

B00821OX98|2.0|Suspend disbelief. That's what the author asks  us to do. In this case there's just too much disbelief to suspend.,
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|This movie takes the audience on a very effective journey showing what it would take for a person to become Superman without tarnishing the feeling of the character. Clark begins as a child with strange abilities that distance him from the outside world and ends the movie as both the hero and the person any fan would expect him to be, learning many of the lessons that transform him into Superman in new, unexpected, moving and genuine ways.<br /><br />Zack, Henry and the rest of the team successfully updated the Man of Steel for a modern world and audience without alienating long time fans. He's still all that is Superman, just in a modern world, with modern consequences.<br /><br />In this rare case, you do get to have your super-cake and eat it, too.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game is great so many new things much better than the original and the best part is its free!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book was outstanding. The description of war and character of the  marines in the Pacific was mind blowing. True to life character of how marines act and conduct themselves.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|Wonderful analysis and thoughtful, up-to-date discussion regarding talent development and its implications. This time, I need eight more words, words.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|The film opens with a lengthy narration explaining the fictional scientific laws of the worlds and how society is structured. It is a bit confusing, but as soon as you see it in action, it becomes apparent. This is a love story about people from two different worlds. The film oozes with symbolism about our society. People who are rich are attracted to the rich world. The poor live as mudlarks valuing anything from the rich world. A heartless corporation forms a link between the two worlds exploiting the poor for the sake of the rich. They rob them of their raw materials and sell back the manufactured product.<br /><br />The scenery and special effects was excellent. Kirsten Dunst's character Eden, was never developed. We didn't know much about her. Adam (Jim Sturgess) we knew more about, but he needed a haircut. They kept his hair greasy and unkempt for effect, but for me it was a needless distraction.<br /><br />The attraction the couple had for each other was carried to an extreme. After being separated for ten years, Adam hasn't moved on. Seriously? Eden, has amnesia and is unattached. The story line needed tweaking, but then don't most romances.<br /><br />It is an interesting film as it is unique in concept. Unfortunately they needed to spend some time on character. A soft 4 stars.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It's exactly what I was looking for in this game. Don't care for the advertisements after you win a game but understand they pay them so we can e njoy games. They are not the type of advertisements that are annoying thank goodness.  Love the game!!!!!!

Ends up being a bit too many things without any of them being properly explained.<br />I found the book lacking organisation. The subjects are a bit too much mixed and one starts before the previous was finished.<br />I'm sorry. Sure Ash Maurya is a great professional. But this book just didn't deliver it to me.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had heard so many great things about this novel, and was  very nervous about reading it. I finally decided to read it, and let me tell you one of my best decisions. The story was not just about to cancer kids preparing to die. It is a heart wrenching novel about true love and how it can come in the craziest of times. This epic love story kept me engulfed from start to end. Once I finished I balled my eyes out! This beautiful love story was  by far the best book I have ever read!!
B000FC0ZAI|5.0|A THOUGHT provoking novel for the adventurer within. Though some may say it's a military novel, it only is in the undertones and is more a spiritual novel which will leave you gripping your tight, with a warm cup of coffee, in a blanket.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Just gross enough to entertain my kidlings too!  Plenty of action, fantastic special effects, and a refreshing take on the classic fairy tale.
B001EBV0K8|5.0|i choose this rating cause this movie is on of the best and its really awesome movie i love it
1606995359|5.0|Anyone who learned to read from comic books will love it.  Scrooge continues to luck out, and the Beagle Boys can't catch a break.  And Glittering Goldie of the Yukon!  If you don't remember her you gotta get this book and make her acquaintance.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is light, easy to open and close and it works well.  I liked the look of it, that is why I purchased it to begin with.  I now love it for it's durability and easy to open and close as I said.  I am getting ready to buy one for my daughter's kindle.  One of the issues she is having with a bulky cover, is the charger.  If you're looking for a great cover, this is it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|First, I love stories dealing with the paranormal and this show has it all. Secondly, I like the way it's handled. They don't always have the answers and things often don't go as expected, but they keep going and trying. And last, but not least, the show is not only entertaining; it makes you think. Could any of these things be real? What if . . . And if any of it could be, wouldn't you want someone down to earth to believe and help you? Besides, Jared and Jensen are just fun to watch!
B005K17RU0|1.0|I mostly use weather apps for the temperature and the weather in motion maps to see how a storm is moving.  The enlarged weather map does not work on my Kindle fire hd. So  this app will not be used.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like playing this game in the car driving to Michigan. I wish I was able to unlock more games quicker.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best app ever there's like 100 games in this app you have racing, frogs, parachutes exc its like an arcade but instead of of machines its in one app if you like random games and don't have a-lot of apps then this ones for you
B002XSP16A|5.0|If you like Streisand, you'll love Susan. None of the haughtiness or nasalness of Streisand, just the beautiful emotions of the songs. So easy to listen to over and over.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie was inspiring, then sad, then inspiring, then sad.  Denzel put on an amazing performance, but nothing else really had my full attention.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I viewed a netflix story of her life and compelled to purchase the music.<br />What a lovely success story and a fabulous voice like frosting on the cake.  I think people love her all the more after hearing about her life.  I know it affected me for a long time afterward.  I listen to her every day and her crystal clear voice penetrates the heart and soul and brings her home to you. Susan Boyle is wonderful!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I  have enjoyed being able to connect and reconnect with current and past co workers.  Great way to network in the professional world. Recommend.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I wrote another review for Standing Ovation and the same goes for this one too.  After seeing her life story on video, I fell in love with her story and had to have her music.  This album is riveting, spiritual and uplifting.  Susan Boyle is truly an inspiration.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This movie has a great story line, but it didn't quite hit the punch line.  Could have been better. Meh.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I needed a summer read and didn't have time to think about what I was choosing. So, I didn't have any expectations. I liked that there was a heroine but it isn't a female or male based story. The people in the book are strong but have character flaws and attributes that make the story interesting. The ending is satisfying.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was hilarious, over the top and awesome.  I can't wait for Red 2.  Thank you Sam Jackson for always being awesome.
B000002AGN|5.0|I owned this album on lp as a kid. It is the first modern jazz album I heard and the classic Dave Brubeck album. The selections are in different time signatures: 5/4, 7/4, etc. Surprisingly, that doesn't make the album inaccessible at all. The group uses the odd time signatures so creatively and plays so skillfully that it all sounds natural. The album has a lot of variety of texture, tempo, and song-structure in addition to the variety of time-signatures. Also, three of the four members are soloists. Paul Desmond, the alto sax player, has a unique tone (he aimed to sound 'like a dry martini') and plays beautifully constructed and melodic solos. If you have never heard Desmond, this album is a great introduction to his work. Brubeck has a heavier style, and leaves a large imprint. He is the musical architect and field general, and complements Desmond very nicely. Drummer Joe Morello was also a gifted soloist if you can handle drum solos. I love them, but not everybody does. Morello used to win polls and had fabulous technique. He was originally a violin prodigy, of all things, but supposedly gave up after hearing Jascha Heifetz play.<br /><br />The recording is fine, as was the original LP. The first digital release back in the 80s had a wiry sound - or maybe we were just getting used to digital.<br /><br />This was a very famous album in the sixties and seventies and holds up well with time. It's an album you can recommend to someone who isn't terribly into jazz but otherwise has eclectic taste. If I had to fault the album I would say it lacks the spontaneity and rough edge you find in hard bop, but it isn't really aiming for that.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I purchased this season to be able to watch and rewatch it.  This show does not disappoint.  Buy any of the three seasons.  They're worth it.
1781162646|4.0|I liked the book. Easy summer reading however it dragged on a bit in the beginning.  The ending was interesting.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I really hate it when movies set deep in the past have modern dialogs.  Please don't add 'dude' or abbreviate anything for movies set in old times.  Other than that, the movie has great effects and action scenes.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Typical of the current Rod Stewart style and a good selection of material varying from his style used in the Songbook set of albums to a leaning towards his earlier songs
B00628RVV0|3.0|This movie carries a good, yet sad message of how being curious could led you to find extraordinary this but also get you into trouble. It was a good movie, but a bit slow.
B009AMANH4|5.0|The film, overall, was a bit slow but this was partly due to the subject matter. I enjoyed it greatly an Daniel Day Lewis was very convincing as Lincoln, based on what I've read of the man.<br />A thoroughly enjoyable film
0307914550|4.0|Great read for runners suffering injury or illness!  Highly recommend it as a leisure read, sort of interesting characters, a little humour and hardship  along the way, nice read
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Looking forward to more levels. It's a treasure hunt with mental puzzles rolled into one. I love games like these.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey, by far, is one of my absolute favorite series.  The drama, the intrigued, mixed in with witty banter and excellent writing is a recipe for a great show.  I cannot wait to see what happens with Matthew Crawley. Although I know he is probably dead from the car accident, I choose to remain hopeful that the writers (as well as the show producers) decided that his character was worth keeping.  We shall see!!!
B000002JSJ|5.0|Led Zeppelin brings down the hammer of the gods HARD on this one! Fueled by the FEROCIUS drumming of the late, great John Bonham, this album ROCKS from beginning to end. Led Zeppelin proves once again that they are still the greatest Rock Band in history!
B004GJVI5C|5.0|Bold Gritty Hard hitting movie, Probably Ben Afflecks best, Well scripted and acted, Not to be missed, Worthy of any collection
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is a great way to learn about how you can get in a lot of trouble and how not to act when your at school. And before I end my review I want to also say that it teaches u what not to<br />do.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|How coulx disney get a release lime wre k it ralph so right. tbe. just drop the ball on this. the movie in cinema graphics are fantastic in 3d. but the problem is not everybody always wants to watch 3d. so in orddr to get the 2d blu ray. you gotta pay 5.99 plus shipping & wait 5 to 6 weeks. to get the bonus disc. hopefully Disney has heard the cries about this and will rectify it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I down loaded this for my kids and grandkids but they have to challeng me and who ever win's gets it. I have had a few strokes and it helps with my hand eye cordonaition.

B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|A fun game that has great graphics and sound.  In the game, you catapult a chimp to catch bananas and gems,.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why does it take it so long to update where's 0.7.2 where's 0.7.3  cause Amazon wants us to wait cause that like perfection but this game  is cool very cool but updates so long
B000HEWEEE|5.0|I loved this movie the 1st time I saw it, and everytime since. Reeves and Bullock are two favorite actors. It seems their love is impossible, but, it just works.
B002DCLQOW|5.0|I love the show, my daughter and I have a similar life to stars of the show.<br />I love my Amazon Prime!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I was put off by crazy war stories right at start, but the rest of the book explained it.  Couldnt put it down.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Ms. Demick has provided an easy-to-read, enjoyable and informative book about a little-understood country, knowledge about which is becoming increasingly important to its neighbors and its enemies. She has provided a wealth of information without being pedantic or boring. Learning about the country's residents and their struggles personalizes the policies of this totalitarian regime in a way no recitation of statistics could do. After reading this book I feel I have a good basic understanding of why North Korea is able to continue acting in such an amazingly contentious manner toward the rest of the world and that I will be able to more intelligently follow her progress in the future. A good read highly recommended.
080701429X|5.0|Dr. Frankl established a paradigm for psychology that didn't seem to take off.  I believe he shows that when you have nothing to live for...life is over.  It inspired me to get out of myself and into helping others.
B002UD56I6|4.0|This is certainly the best behind-the-scene documentary that I've ever seen.  Besides the main documentary, there are hours of many smaller ones each supporting one facet of the production.  There is much to be learned by seeing how the show's resourceful and effective executive producer Kenny Ortega gingerly worked with the creative and sensitive genius of Michael Jackson in developing the never-completed event.  It would have been epic.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It Wont let me download it idk why I hope they fix it soon I finaley found it and now it wont let me download it for seem reason please fix it idk if its just me or its really not downloading anymore but ill give it a 5 star anyway
B00001OH1S|5.0|Great music soundtrack from the movie. Makes you feel like you are watching the movie all over again.  Highly recommend for your movie soundtrack collection.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I really bought it for my young cousin, but the whole family had a ball watching it.<br /><br />There is enough pop-culture references that entertain the adult audience while not being vulgar like many modern comedies.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Excellent.  Plays very well. Will buy again .  Great price for this product.  Description is exactly what you get.  Thanks.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really great game easy to play and passes the time well would recommend to all on kindle fire hd, happy days
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo....loved it.  Will watch it many times I'm sure.  My son watched it and also enjoyed it.<br /><br />Have not yet read Joyland.  Unable to comment.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Even though it is not Linkin Park's best album, it still rocks! Since it is the PA version, its even better haha
159562015X|3.0|I already had the book as I borrowed it from a friend but I needed a new access code for the online assessment. The book online defines/describes various strengths a person can have. It doesn't go into detail as to how to build or grow on those skills and it doesn't help you identify your skills unless you complete their online assessment. I wish I could have just done everything online, as opposed to having to buy a book.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Excellent writing, superb acting, a real treasure I look forward to watching each episode. The kind of show you could watch over and over again
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|this game is so amazing I love playing.  I play this game for hours and hours and cant get enough.
B00000K2UX|5.0|I watched the movie and decided to go one step farther, and look for a soundtrack. I put the soundtrack on my wish list and got it, when I could. I love the movie.<br /><br />I would recommend the both the soundtrack and the movie.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|For the price it is pretty good.  Good construction that looks good. I would purchase the product again if I needed one.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I was hoping for a longer, more in-depth look at the man behind the 20th century.  It does show how money was not what the guy was after and so he got screwed by the more shrewd folks of his time.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the choices. Maybe try adding a distarnt  fog horn sound. I enjoy different sounds while traveling. Most of the time I enjoy the night time and frog noises.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just finished this book for the second time and WOW, it was even better this time! This book completely captivates you from the very first page.  The characters, Sky and Holder, are so well developed and I felt every but of pain, anguish and happiness they did.  This book definitely stays with you!!  Colleen Hoover is pure genius!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Cubistry is very entertaining and keeps my mind sharp. Easy to use once I figured out how to use it.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Argh!  I'm addicted.  I love it and want more!!  This space shooter will keep you busy for hours on end.  I can sit on planes, in airports, on bridge calls (conference calls) and be totally entertained.  Thank you!
B0015AARJI|3.0|This should be long lasting, my son is very careful and doesn't drop it or hit it but still, it has a short life. As time passes by, about once every two years, and playing only on weekends for nearly four hours in all, the control turns to be not very accurate and that is why we have to change it.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|This movie was good for a fantasy flick, the characters and actors were enjoyable enough.  I always like to see Famke Janssen again, she's always pretty hot being a bad chick.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This tragic real life 'vacation from hell' will pull at your heartstrings. One of those rare times when my husband and I watched an entire movie together (he's the 'clicker king' when it comes to control of the remote) however, this time he made no move to switch, pause or fast forward.<br />The acting was superior as well as the special effects. The characters made you feel as if you had just unpacked your bags [on their vacation].<br />Throwing a family into this situation is one thing but surviving it rested solely on their love of one another. What a son would not do...how a Mother could hang on...and how a Father truly believed. If you don't get emontional during some of these scenes you are not human.<br />I found myself praying for everyone (again) that went through this ordeal...and wonder still at the shear power of nature.<br />A must see...and a message....that really, nothing is 'impossible'.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging brain teaser. Good graphics. Hope there will be more levels coming soon. Ten levels leave you wanting more. Recomend to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice animals and love the real life chores. It is a great game and I recommend it to any horse lover.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I love this CD. This is totally awesome and some of the best songs.. Enough said try it out for yourselves.
1603429999|5.0|This is another wonderful book that I am so glad that I have ordered and so many wonderful lessons and information I have learned from this book even though I have been circular knitting for many years
0440237688|5.0|Needed this book for my son's required summer reading.  The book came very prompt and in very good conditiion, just as stated.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series and Julian Fellowes is a genius!  Long live Sir Julian.  May he continue to create this and other programs.  I have watched it over and over - never get tired of the characters, landscapes, clothes, etc.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I don't understand the bad reviews. What a perfect ending for Sookie! Sookie was always independent and I don't think it would have been right to end it any other way! I have read all the books and am very satisfied!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Couldn't put it down! Maybe not my favorite of Folletts but certainly entertaining. I recommend this book for a summer read!
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This is a great action, adventure and sci-fi movie!  The acting and story are both great, I really hope this movie does well on rental as it is well worth the money.  I hope Tom Cruise does more movies like this one!
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Bruce Willis again ends up in a situation where he's going to save the day but with the added drama of his son being involved and unknown to him until he's in too deep and causes more problems for his kid who already had things under control and on track. After watching the other DieHards, it does seem a little predictable but I love action flicks and no one does them better than Bruce Willis :)
B007XF0X6G|4.0|This is a tune out and tune in action movie with some decent 3D effects.  The first movie was better in terms of the action sequences and story but the actors camping it up in this one definitely makes for a good time  The presentation and transfer on this disc is superb and you won't regret a purchase if you are a fan of the first movie.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|When I talk to Tom he just sits there doing nothing not good for the kindle fire THIS APP SUCKS
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This app is awesome I have no clue what the glitch is they were talking about but I love this app. The only way to become a zombie is to beat the samurai part
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I can't wait to purchase Losing Hope. I have to delve deeper into Holder and Sky's past, present, and future.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|As usual Mr. Follett weaves a great tale of interest. And many historical references, also dogged detail. Now on to book two.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best TV series that I have ever seen.  Love the story plot, acting, and costumes.  Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I never read this type of romance series before but with all the talk, I read this book a little over a year ago. I loved/love this book. After all the books I have read since, this is still the best of them all.<br />For me, it was not just about the hot & steamy scenes that most people talk about but it was the empowerment that I got from this book.  I thought about why I felt this way and I think it was because of way that Ana stood up for what was acceptable for her.  There was a sentence or two in the third book, I believe, where she said that Christian made her feel good about her body. This series made me feel that way.  I did not look at myself as unworthy any longer.  I think it is great when a book can be enjoyable and leave me when a lasting impression.<br />I also thought the book was very funny.  My husband asked me if this was supposed to be funny as I laughed away.  I loved the emails and the way Christian picked at the imaginery lint off his pants.<br />People also do not give credit that there is a story here and only talk about the sex.  I don't want to give too much away to those who have not read it.<br />I hate to reveal this but what I really liked is that the couple marry and yet there is a whole entire book after that when most books climax (no pun intended) at the end with marriage.  Most of the time they do not even deal with a wedding.  After you go through so much with characters, other books just drop off the cliff.  There was a need for the third book because there were unresolved issues with the story and the couple but so many other authors would have had them live together, resolve the issues and then end with marriage.  This book still created a fantastic story and moving romance after the I do's.  The fact that they were married and had issues and stayed together was a great lesson for any type of relationship.  That no matter how hard it gets, it can work.  I would recommend to read the books twice.  The first time, especially ifyou never read romances, you will be swept away by the sex and romance but when you get to read it again, you will see all the other struggles and emotions that go along with it.  I think you will see a moment or two that will even relate to you somehow.<br />I read a tremendous amount of books a year and most of the times, I cannot remember character names or entire plots but I will never forget Christian and Anastasia so there must be something to it.
055358202X|3.0|Loved the extremely speedy book delivery to my door!  Was not pleased that the actual book was labelled for sale in &#34;excellent condition&#34; it was not.  A better description of its condition should have been &#34;fair&#34;. The book itself was the usual good read by this author.  Thank you for listening.
B0064NTZJO|2.0|Drive is a film that is trying to be a art house / action flick / film noir / love story , in reality it fails on almost all of its attempts. The film does not have enough action to make it an actions flick and the plot line was too predictable to be a true art house and its simply not cynical enough to be a good noir film. What you are left with is a muddled piece of schizophrenic  cinema that at best is a love story with some violent scenes.<br /><br />With that being said let me say that the acting was very good, no qualms about that, but Ryan Gosling's was miscast as the main character. He simply doesn't have the persona  to pull off the tough guy act (a Hollywood stunt driver yes, but a tough guy that will take out a professional paid killer who has a gun with only his hands - no way), however on the plus side he makes Matt Damon as Jason Bourne seem just a little more believable.<br /><br />Some of the biggest problems I had with the film are the almost myriad of goofs, errors, continuity problems and downright slopping filming and editing, combine that with the completely unrealistic portrayal of people and how they react or in most cases under react got to be unbelievably comical so at least this provided some entertainment.  Take for example,  Ryan Gossling T-bones a car doing 40+ mph, launching that car through the air and he doesn't damage the front of his car, the headlights are still on and the engine running. Or the hilarious \\"lighthouse\\" beam that is focused on the beach not out to sea.<br /><br />Some people complain about the soundtrack, but I thought it worked for the most part. The filming with shadows was nice but that has been done hundreds of times before so it's hardly anything to get excited about.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this film has no redemptive quality, it doesn't make any statement that resonates with reality driven humans, it's not very entertaining to watch, in fact it can be quite slow and boring (the first 40 minutes). Gosling's character is so sedated and yet at the same time deranged that you don't feel much empathy for him. Ultimately this film will appeal to the crowd who wants to appear to be edgy and in and either don't notice or don't care about all of the incongruities. I think a good predictor of if you will like this movie is if you liked Kill Bill, although the stories are nothing alike I saw many similarities (unrealistic, trying to be edgy, . However, those  who appreciate a good \\"somewhat believable\\" story line will find this film too unrealistic to swallow.sling's character is so sedated and yet at the same time deranged that you don't feel much empathy for him.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the old version! Why on earth would you mess up such a nice app with such a dumb update. This app is no more use for me and I will delete it.
B00CO6QGCE|2.0|Although the free version is somewhat capable it's disappointing how expensive it is to get a few features.  If you want to buy the lowest 'package' deal that comes with pre CUEing your track it's nearly $50.  That is ridiculous and should be around $15.  To compare the completely fully functional including a ton more features than this, Traktor for the iPad is $20.  To get similar features out of this app you'd have to pay nearly $100!

B000002KIT|5.0|The raves for this CD are definitely justified: this is a great live concert recording. For some baffling reason Thin Lizzy remain one of the more underrated rock bands of the 1970s and early 1980s. They put out some mighty fine studio albums, but this live album was perhaps their best of all, showcasing their dynamic range of musical styles, everything from guitar-propelled rockers to pop gems and a few tunes bordering on power ballads. Their sound was often \\"hard\\" but by no means were they some sort of heavy metal mind. They had far too much pop sense and melodic threads in their song to qualify for the head-banger's ball. But man, those guitars could wail! After all these years, this remains an essential rock landmark.

B000WZOMRA|5.0|You can't beat Danny Kaye for top notch funny.  This is my favorite movie of his and I was quite happy to find it still available.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|Although the third book was disappointing, that doesn't detract from this one being an awesome read and very satisfying follow up to the first book.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really enjoy the variety of sounds.  I use them to get my four and five-year-olds to sleep at nap time and at night.  It is so relaxing that I sometimes fall asleep with them.  I also enjoy the sounds myself and does my husband since he introduced them to me.  Overall, a great program.

How is it accounted for?<br />What is an acceptable basis in this age to deny pain killers to the dying?<br />What is the justification for denying modern medicine to patients when the subject uses the best and costly modern methods for herself?<br />What is the justification for no birth control in this age?<br />To what extent do we, and should we, allow 'religious conviction' to deflect responsibility and accountability of ones own actions?<br /><br />These are quite legitimate Qs for CH to raise and for me to consider. I am driven to the conclusion that Mother Teresa was a dangerous religious fanatic and that she chose to be so and in doing so caused great pain to many people unable to resist her. The book therefore, altho, slim was a very useful addition to my understanding of religion.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you use your brain. You have to find clues and memorize patterns and sequences, and then use use them and objects you to collect to get out of the room. If you feel like being a detective this will get your juices flowing!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool game and quite challenging! I wanted to cheat so bad! I can't wait to see the new levels. Keep it coming!

B005LAIH2C|5.0|Good film considering what others had to say about it. I definitely enjoyed watching it...twice lol! Disc was in great condition.
1419705644|1.0|When I pre-ordered this eons ago, I was expecting it to be something more. I was hoping to have some secrets or information revealed about Adventure Time and the Land of Ooo, but instead.. It's pretty much just a rehash of what you've seen in the show and often times, not even well. There are times when it's clear the writer actual writer didn't know much or have much to say, so it was filled in with random rambling garbage. Seriously, there is better information than this on wikipedia.<br /><br />This is just a massive disappointment. It's not enjoyable at all for me. I was hoping for and expecting more, outside of the show, not just quasi-rehash of things we've seen up to season 4 (maybe some of 5, it's hard to tell because it's just THAT generic). Sure it's pretty to look at and it might make you chuckle a few times, but ultimately.. if you've seen the show and don't want a cute little picture book about the show, skip this. There's nothing new in it and it's really just a sad attempt to milk money from the series (instead of ya know.. releasing the entire thing on DVD like they should be doing, we get.. this?). It doesn't even include anything from the comic book series (prob because the author hasn't read it and instead, just pulled basic info off wikipedia).<br /><br />The worst for me, personally, was the open rehash of the episode \\"The Monster\\" in the Lumpy Space Princess section. Oh and BMO gets a small entry and a useless \\"manual\\" that once again, reveals nothing new. It'd have been nice to get some more behind the scenes comments and connections. Also some history that isn't revealed in the series. Because seriously, any kid, teen, or adult whose watched the series thus far could have written this book and probably done a better job.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|After the mixed reviews of this film I'd heard of I'm glad I decided to purchase it myself. DVD was in great condition and arrived right away.
B00A285OOW|3.0|There were a few things in this story that stood out and I found interesting considering some of the history facts or speculations- if you will- that I know. In Gregory's story Elizabeth of York and Richard lll were lovers. I don't know a whole lot of details during this period but from what I heard there is evidence that Richard was extremely fond of Elizabeth, but not to the extent of being lovers.<br /><br />Henry and his mother (Margaret Beaufort) were often times harsh, belittling, and unfeeling towards Elizabeth. That did not sit well with me at all. I felt that if Elizabeth would only wise up to the fact that she indeed had power, and if she would only discover it... (Did she discover that you ask? That is something you will have to find out.) I came to the conclusion early on in the story that maybe one of the reasons why she was treated as she was by her husband and mother-in-law... was because they knew what power she could possibly wield and kept her down because of it. That is one way to look at it.<br /><br />Gregory gives an interesting perspective of Henry's character and it was a real issue for me. He became agitated, fearful and obsessed with being de throne. His behavior reminded me of someone on the edge of losing it completely. As I continued reading on I kept on thinking, \\"If Henry's name or his obsession and fear of a pretender who could possibly over throw him was mentioned one more time I was wanting to jump right in the book and give him a good shake and a what for!<br /><br />The overall dynamics of Henry, Margaret Beaufort and Elizabeth's relationship is bold and complicated- in this story- to say the least. I did rather liked how Elizabeth's character developed towards the end and the outcome of that. Elizabeth's thoughts and feelings toward her husband and mother-in-law is certainly a complex one and she is someone I think we could all learn a thing or two from. Although it is in the present tense, it was interesting to read this story in her point of view. I felt it could have been presented to the reader a bit stronger than written.<br /><br />History in my view tends to be subjective. Whether how an historian or an historical fiction writer is interpreting the past, the key is to make it believable. In historical fiction- readers asked themselves, \\"Could this have possibly have happen this way and does it blend well with the fictional aspects of the story?\\" \\"Or is it historically accurate?\\" As an avid reader of history and historical fiction-this story I did not always get that feeling, if you will. Although, in the author's notes, Gregory says, \\"This book is written on a number of levels. It is a fiction about a mystery-so two steps from any historically recorded facts; but at the heart of it are some historical facts that you can rely on, or study for yourself.\\" So I will leave it up to you-the reader-to form your own opinions.<br /><br />How this story was written and the characterization certainly has given me food for thought and I look forward to doing further research to draw my own conclusions. I recommend this novel to people who enjoy lite Historical Fiction.<br /><br />Stephanien her point of view.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use evernote across 4 different devices as a commonplace book that collects all sorts of interesting tidbits of information. I love being able to see an article at work and use Clearly to save it for reading later,  then annotated the note with my own thoughts at home and pull them up on my phone on the go. The only thing I wish it did better would be adding the ability to highlight text within the app itself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne collins has created this wonderful series about the future of north America where all that's left are the Capitol and it's thirteen districts. The first novel was amazing, the second, another literary wonder, but the third wraps up the breathtaking series wonderfully. I highly recommend this series it did not disappoint me, and it won't cease to amaze you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This season keeps you on the edge of your seat.  It takes you back to such a different time and place.  The show is beautifully shot!  Keep watching.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this as a gift to my boyfriend, who has grown up playing Zelda, and even though he has played most all of the Zelda games, he thoroughly enjoyed reading through this book and reminiscing and I for one enjoyed getting to learn more about the older Zelda games that I missed out on playing as a child. It was a great gift and I can definitely see how its preorders knocked 50 Shades off the top list for a few weeks: it's that good of a book. Any Zelda fan should definitely own this.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Both of Bruno Mars' albums were amazing, but this is my favorite. Such a talented artist. He also puts in a great show if you have a chance to see him live.
B005F96URI|5.0|This movie is extremely entertaining, if not different than your typical action flick. But I for one followed it's development online from announcement to dvd release and even considered taking a roadtrip to see it's limited release a few states over because of how much faith I had in this movie based on the storyline and cast alone.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  This is an interesting and exciting story that the reader will find hard to put down.
B008Y73940|4.0|Good premise and plot line. Mathew McConaughey is a LA street-wise attourney who may have unconventional means, but is guided by good intentions....

B004UHL9EK|5.0|This is a great little timer app that sites what it says and doesn't cause me any grief. I really can't recommend this any more than to say that I have not burned a steak since I got this app.
1781162646|4.0|Not one of King's best but thoroughly enjoyed it.  Kept me entertained until the end with multiple storylines. Not really like any of King's other books... could make a good movie.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Fun for all ages! Love this game! Everyone will enjoy testing their speed, agility and recognition skills. My grandson fas been playing since he was 2 but I love the game as well. We can actually play together. Great fun!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i thought season 1 and 2 were amazing especially because they were free to watch ( for prime members)  but after a lot of consideration i purchases season 3 and was sooo happy. Such a memorable season, sets the stage for a lot more drama

B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book has many surprises and makes you question why some things must happen. I guess the question who will finally take control of the Seven Kingdoms. What is the roll that the Dragon Queen truly play?

B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is really helpful it will tell you how long you have left using other apps before you run out of juice.didn't get five stars because it constantly asks you to write a review which is why I'm writing this one.all considered though very helpful considering its FREE
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a great read. It kept my interest throughout and I was totally caught off guard by the twist at the end.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|We have played this with my 7 and 2 year old and they love it too!<br /><br />This is great for the whole family and works great on my Kindle Fire!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This has been the summer of really amazing YA reads, with one exception.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0545509890 Openly Straight]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00B6U1818 The Summer I Became a Nerd]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005ZOBNOI The Fault in Our Stars]]<br /><br />And now Eleanor and Park!<br /><br />People who don't read YA don't understand the complexity contained in this category. All the big issues humans face are handled beautifully, and in great depth.<br /><br />The Park in Eleanor and Park is a boy who feels like an outsider, but has a solid family and home life. Not a perfect family, but in intact one, with two loving parents. He is half Korean, and this leads to some of his feelings about acceptance.<br /><br />The Eleanor in Eleanor and Park is a true outsider. Poor, fat, from a broken home, many siblings, an abusive stepfather, am absent father, a mother who is little-to-no protection.<br /><br />They fall in love on the school bus, and it begins largely without words. Parks inherent kindness when he realizes she's covertly reading his comics allows them to build a connection.<br /><br />E&P makes holding hands seem like the sexiest thing ever.<br /><br />However magical and sweet their love, the author makes it clear that there are perhaps insurmountable obstacles to a happy ending. Eleanor is deeply damaged, and struggles with her self-worth. She's a minor with little agency over her own life. Park is a kid with a supportive family and opportunities. Does love conquer all when one person's foundation is crumbling? Park is a compassionate kid, but does he have the life experience to understand the severity of Eleanor's wounds?<br /><br />Terrific book, terrific author. One of those books I hated to see end.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Finished the book within a week, quick for me as I am not a skimmer. The final book wraps everything up as I would have hoped and the action was pretty much non stop. Great ending to a fantastic series. Now we'll see if I go back through and read all the books again from the start...
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book is well written &  I am glad I read it.  As a Christian I look forward to heaven, my eternal home.  Unfortunately I do not believe Mr. Alexander was in heaven.  Nothing in this book comports with the teaching of the Bible concerning God or heaven.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Now that I have grown up to the world of smart phones I use them for everything. In my car and even around the house XiiaLive Pro is excellent Sirius replacement, plus it is free!

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Exhausts the heat from my I7 990X just as I had hoped. Fans run quiet. Was reasonably priced. Would buy again.<br /><br />*Edit<br />I realized the title is misleading. Forgot this is only a SINGLE FAN. I tweaked the design of my case to get it to fit, removed the side fan and added it to the Cooler...now it is a dual fan.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This product was delivered as shown on amazon without issues. I would  buy from this seller again. Thank you very much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book really got to me. What a great story line, I was totally surprised where it headed. I will definitely keep my eye out for this author. Her writing style and perspective was great.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|It was hard to read this book simply because it's a tragedy. The first 20% made it hard to finish. Knowing what happened and reading details are two different things. But there is s happy outcome you only wish it happens sooner. Easy to read. Keep in mind it's her words not a story so the grammar is basic not beautifully written to keep you hanging on.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is... inspiring. I have read this book four times, and am in the middle of reading it a fifth time. It's a book that you don't put down once you start reading.

B008QE9XD2|4.0|Maybe it's the look of the movie I like the most. I find it entertaining and the love scene where they throw each other around ROCKS!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Enjoyed game. Graphics were wonderful. Skill level was good. Old and young people will have fun with this game. Can't wait for the next one.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I am pleased with all the loose ends being tied up and Sookie having some hope for the life she dreamed of.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I downloaded three escape games. This is my favorite. Not obvious, you do have to think a little bit. Hope they update with more than ten levels!
B00BGDQNLU|2.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I thought I would not be able to find a copy after lending my DVD to an unscrupulous friend. I was quite glad to see this for sale. When I got the BRD I found it had no menu but to play the movie. No scene selection, no special features. Just the movie. Now, I would not grouse if it had the scene selection w/o further special features but not even that was available. Not a great buy.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|This was a great movie. 3d is awesome. Has been the best 3d movie I have ever seen at home.
0345529057|5.0|Great series, watched hob series and had to read the books, worth every second.acton packed from the first word the last word. Just incredible!

B00785P2QC|3.0|Good not great play alot but overall a boring game it however a good pass time will continue to play though
B00782O7IY|5.0|Wonderful movie. Fully deserving of the several Oscars. Have rented it three times already. Decided I might as well buy it!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Loved this, but I was left with the curiosity of what happened with Franks family back in Ireland and his father.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wonderful read, couldn't put it down. Finished it in just 3  days! Can't wait to read the next one now

B00119ZMKW|5.0|Season Six saw a major character replaced, however this fresh blood helped keep the series new and interesting for Season Six.  I wasn't sure how I'd like the new character, but he quickly grew on me and became an excellent addition to the team and to the show.  I was sorry he didn't stick around for Season Seven+.
1609611543|5.0|The book makes a lot of sense . It is easy to read and understand. The cook book has great recipes
B0058RCVYS|5.0|Brilliant film that touches your soul about real human people, life, love, compassion, and loss.  The acting is amazing and great character development and story-line.  Hollywood should learn to make movies again by watching films like this :) ***** Five Stars!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is very entertaining! sure, sometimes you have to wait to do stuff but, it is still worth it. i love jurassic park so i got this game as soon as i found it!
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|There's not much else to say that would be unexpected about these guys.  They're all top-notch musicians and the performances are up at the top of the list.  Richie Kotzen has always been known to hard rock fans as a virtuoso guitar player but he's long flown under the radar as a stellar songwriter and singer.  This album is right up there with some of his other recordings such as Mother Head's Family Reunion (Debut and [[ASIN:B0019A4T5W Go Faster]]), [[ASIN:B0000CNY3H Change]], [[ASIN:B00334F4IS Peace Sign]], and [[ASIN:B005ORUG2Q Something to Say]].  His soulful vocals soar above even the guitar playing in several of the songs.  I hope people start to turn onto his previous work, because it's audio gold.<br /><br />There is a lot to like with this album...there's a little bit of everything on there.  While all three artists standout on their own, they do it within the natural fabric of the songs and band.  It's very much worth the purchase!
B00DHNB5CY|3.0|Maybe too gruesome, not as creative as the original. But, I think it's better than other slasher movies of late.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I have not read the book so will not offer a comparison.<br />This is an intriguing story of a human girl who is inhabited by an alien soul that tries to take over. But the two learn to live together, trying to survive among humans trying to kill the aliens and aliens trying to kill the humans by absorbing their memories.<br />Nice acting from William Hurt and Saoirse Ronan.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The lower floors were easy but as I got to the higher floors they became a little more challenging. At that point I couldn't put the game down.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I used to have the Weather Channel app, but they changed the format.  I love this new one.  It's really comprehensive and tells me everything I need to know in a very user-friendly way.
B00962341U|5.0|I have always been a fan of Leona since her first CD. For me Echo was even better than Spirit. Glassheart however surpasses both albums by a long shot. Since being first released in the UK last October I was patiently waiting for this album to become available in the States, however after 9 months of impatiently waiting I just couldn't wait any longer so I decided to order from amazon. With that being said, Glassheart, is possibly once of the best albums I have ever had the privilege of listening to. It's definitely in my top 3. If you are a fan of Leona you don't want to miss this album. It's that good. My favorite among favorite tracks are Un Love Me, Lovebird, Come Alive, I to You, Stop the Clocks, Glassheart, Fingerprint and the bonus track Sugar.
B007G51UV0|4.0|ASUS builds good stuff.  Their customer support is for the birds if and when you need it, but what they build is good.  This is my third ASUS board, and I decided to go with the Ivy Bridge 1155 socket as opposed to the Haswell 1150 because the two chips I was considering--the 3770k and the 4770k are just about the same performance wise out of the box, but the 3770k overclocks better and uses less power in the desktop versions of the two sockets.  Furthermore, the 1155 systems are a known and are reliable; the 1150 is probably going to be great, after all, it is the future, but I anticipate the usual number of teething problems.  The P8Z77-V Pro is a solid and feature rich motherboard and doesn't rely on some of the gimmicks that other ASUS boards do (I am thinking of the Sabertooth mostly, with all of that dust protection that doesn't really do much except cost money and perhaps shield the board from a little dust).  Anyway, despite our differences over the years, and \\"Benson\\" and I have fought our wars, I must say that ASUS builds a fine motherboard at any given cost point, and this one is no different.
B00BUT5I84|1.0|When i first listen to 30STM, they just caught me... the Jared Leto's voice was so unique that I buyed the first album and it didn't disappoint me, the second album was great also, the third one wasn't great but still good... then along came LOVE LUST FAITH + DREAMS and i didn't believe it... where was the band a knew ??? Where are the powerfull hard rock songs ?? Where are the inspiring lirycs ?... I support the bands i like in them worst moments, but this album is a joke i listened for two days in a roll in my car and it didn't work, i give it a chance believe me but at the third day i just rolled down my car window and throw it away because i couldn't find a reason to keep it and i didn't gave it to anybody because i didn't want to hurt nobody's ears. DON'T BUY IT, IS JUST A WASTE OF TIME !!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is fun and easy to use.  There are a lot of pop up adds but it only takes a second to skip them! Definitely not a reason not to get this game.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|This is a tour de force from a writer completely confident in his material and research. The opening had me so gripped that I started to fall in love with Greta Weissensteiner and wanted to elbow Wilhelm aside and rescue her from his dusty bookshop. But as I have already read so much about this period I felt the tentacles of dread reaching out to throttle me as the inevitable approached and despatching Wilhelm would only have removed the Weissenteiners luck!<br />I've always struggled to comprehend the control Hitler exerted over his volk. There is no doubt that he was charismatic but there must have been something buried deep within the German psyche which allowed him to perpetrate such horrors on his people for what he perceived as their own good. Stalin was a simple gangster in comparison.<br />There have been many books written about the treatment of Jews in Europe before and during the war but few authors have succeeded in shining such a bright spotlight on the cancer of anti-Semitism as Christoph.<br />Ben Elton tried recently with 'Two Brothers' but, in comparison, that is a jumbled unfocussed account.<br />True, some readers might find the long explanatory passages challenging but this is such a complex subject that these are essential for clarity and to cement the various strands of the Weissenteiners' story together.<br />Christoph is meticulous in his approach and has the gifts of a natural story teller. I suspect that this is only the first in a long line of must read books.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Excellent game it keeps my son's going for hours. They should make it free to get diamonds though or its not free for very long.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't care about the zombies, the writing is fantastic!  Michon is a great addittion to the cast.  Can't wait for season 4!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is an excellent love story and I cannot wait to see it continue, yet, I do not want it to end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|For a non-action drama, this show keeps me at the edge of my seat.  I knew about the fate of the beloved cast member before I ever watched the season, but that was an emotional ending nonetheless.  LOVE Maggie Smith!
B005CRY2O6|3.0|This cookbook reminds that I often say that a vegetarian has much more in common with an omnivore than with a vegan. Must *every* recipe rely on animal products? So much cheese! Oh well.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|Miss Jepsen may be the best singer to come out of Canada this decade. Of course bands like Rush and Dream Theater are in a league of their own, but holding anyone to their standards is unfair. When you compare Jepsen to other pop sensations like Justin Bieber or Avril Lavigne, she's clearly Canada's best. In fact, the only bad track on this album is bad because of Bieber's unworthy presence upon it. Otherwise, this is a fantastic album.<br /><br />I'm a metalhead. Carly's album is sitting between an Amon Amarth disc and a SkeletonWitch album, if that gives you any perspective. Why do I love this album? Simple: It feels genuine, and that's rare in pop music. When she's excited (like in the post-bridge of \\"Call Me Maybe\\"), she genuinely sounds like she's grinning ear-to-ear. Songs like \\"Hurt So Good\\" show off how bouncy and chipper her voice can be, while \\"Tonight I'm Getting Over You\\" shows how that cheer can translate into a \\"you can't stop me\\" attitude. Very endearing. I truly wish more pop music could have this genuine sound. If only Bieber weren't on the one song, this would be the perfect female pop album.<br /><br />Word of Advice: Check out Carly's first album. It's as overlooked as it is enjoyable.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|There is a lot of controversy surrounding this movie because it changed some aspects of the Superman story, this movie is not perfect, but it is great. It has heart, not a lot but some comic relief, and possibly the best action I have seen in a movie before. Just watch it, do it now, why are you still reading this?
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This is a gritty setup book for the other two novels in the series. I think most people start out liking Logen, dislike Jazel and are probably split about Glotka. The side characters come across early on as mostly likeable, maybe Ferro as the exception. You think you are getting one thing and have the characters all pegged in the first book, and the story is good enough to want to continue, but this setup book is a setup in more than one way.<br /><br />I won't put spoilers in this review except to say the following books start to have you question your initial thoughts about many of the characters, who the good and bad guys are, if there are any good or bad guys truly. Everyone has their reasons for what they do and I don't know that any of them are truly good or evil.<br /><br />The biggest complaint about this book is the lack of action and it's a fair point. Things happen but you don't really know what the point of most of it is, where will they go what will they do till near the end. That said it's worth the ride to get ready for the other two books.<br /><br />There is black humor in this book and it's very good. I laughed out loud more than a few times. There is a sense of dread as you really don't know who is safe at any point, which is always a good thing in these types of epic fantasy books.<br /><br />Be warned, if you don't like graphic content (not sexual but there is a bit of that) and dark dreary descriptions stay away form this book. There are very few happy rays of sunshine and things go wrong far more than they go right.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|Solid quality through the whole CD not a single song I didn't appreciate, I was really happy most of my favorite Harris songs were on here.
B003KIMOIK|4.0|If you like the oldies, this is a good one to watch.  It was your usual old silly movie.  You ask yourself why did I ever like this.  It did have an ok plot.  The acting is standard old school.

B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I so enjoyed this book. The concept of love being a disease of which there is a cure was a  great and unique plot. I was interested from the first page to the last. All the characters developed nicely and I just can't wait to start on the next book of the trilogy. I thought it was good to see both sides of being cured verses accepting the disease called love and embracing all that goes with it. To make the choice to go with love in spite of all the obstacles and risks it involves made this such a good story.This was a believable situation and the setting is in current times which made it seem even more real. This is a young adult novel worth reading and will be enjoyed by all ages.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|This is a little harder than I expected - which is great!  I want to keep the mind active and the brain activity at a level of a younger person. PS - I am not that old, it is just I feel old sometimes as my mind does not always think as quickly as I want it to. !  I think this training will help.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I came to the zombie party late, but after watching seasons one & two on Netflix, I am officially hooked!!! I'm crushed that Netflix doesn't have Season 3 yet, and I refuse to pay this much at Amazon for the whole season...so I just purchased the first two episodes of Season 3 to quench my thirst. I hope to eventually be caught up with Season 3 before Season 4 starts! Awesome show!

015206057X|2.0|My little one gets a little bored with this one. However he loves almost all of Mem Fox's other books.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Everyone knows about Princess Diana and the unfortunate circumstances around her death. What you don't really ever see (in my experience) is the story from the Queen's perspective. This is just that. The move takes place around the time of Diana's death and is primarily told through the lens of the Queen. It sets up a good dichotomy between the \\"establishment\\" (royals and nobility) and everyone else. You really get a great perspective on just how differently they think compared to the rest of us.<br /><br />The Queen is pretty aloof, and throughout the film, you are left wondering if she really ever cared about Diana. If this movie is any indication, her feelings towards her were cool at best. However the Queen isn't heartless--she believes at her core she knows the British people better than anyone, but when they turn on her because of her reaction to the death, it really shakes her, and that's what the movie is mostly about, how the Queen deals with her belief system being threatened.

B004PZ4HC8|3.0|The story was written in a complicated manner. No beg inng or ending. When I saw the movie, I was shocked to see it had very little to do with the book.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|You can play this for free on the internet but this actually saves your progress for you. Which is better so you don't have to restart.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book is the most amazing piece of literature that I have read in a long time. The speech in this book make it sound like everyday words exchanged and the descriptions are fantastic.
B0067R0APK|1.0|It's a pity and a piece of s***. What a waste of time.I don't know how many people that they have screwed
B005544TRQ|5.0|USA has done it again. Burn Notice, White Collar, Covert Affairs, Psych, and now Suits.  Funny, enchanting, spellbinding with that flair that characterizes all USA shows.  If you liked any of their others then you have to at least try this.  Unfortunately when you try it you will be hooked and then there's no going back.  Now on Season 3 and still loving every minute.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Liked it! Good for me and my kids. Sometime  it took us a while to figure out.<br /><br />Liked the challenge.
1475143389|5.0|I've been following this workout routine and diet plan for a couple months now, and it's working great! For years now I've been eating healthy and exercising, but I never really established a solid routine or diet plan, much like the author mentions in this book, I was another person feeling like I was doing everything right, but wasn't getting the right results. I had tried a routine that promised it was a shortcut to getting a sixpack, which I'm embarrassed to admit I paid $99 for, and it didn't provide with me half the information I've gotten from this book for a fraction of the price. He goes into detail about how your body uses carbs, fats, proteins etc and why they're good and which one's to stay away from. He also strongly advocates checking labels and looking up what the ingredients actually are (simple I know, but something I myself often never bothered doing) funny how much more I notice now that I check a lot more often, a friend of mine unfortunately fell for a pyramid scheme selling health products and tried to get me to buy a $60 bottle of pills that supposedly help burn fat, after looking at the ingredients I pointed out that I could find an identical supplement made by another company that contained the same ingredients for $12.  About 7 weeks of following the diet and workout routine (starting on a cutting plan because I was at about 20% body fat) I've now lost 10lbs! I've been trying to get my waist back to where it used to be about 7 years ago and I finally got there with the information from this book! He's also great about responding to emails and answering any questions you have. With this book I also purchased 2 other books by the author (the shredded chef & cardio sucks) both full great info, I would definetly recommend at least getting the shredded chef to accompany this book, it's helped me a ton with planning out my meals. Also clears up which supplements are good and bad and explains why with solid facts backed up by science and studies conducted by universities. This is the first review I've ever bothered leaving on amazon, I feel I owe it to the author because after years of struggling to lose my extra stomach fat, I've finally gotten there with his honest information at a more than fair price.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|The story was great! The alchemist was one of the best Nicholas Flamel books ever made! I recommend it! A great summer read!
B00DCX08MW|3.0|This game is just a remake if Aces over Europe it lags in the original games experience. Although it is still a good time passer just needs a little bit of enhanced theater action added. I play this game once in a while and find still I enjoy this game. No recommendation download and try it you will like it or not. Happy flying.(Amazon verified purchase)  [[ASIN:B00DCX08MW B00DCX08MW]]
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Really fun app. Very addictive...Really tests your problem solving skills. Played almost 2hrs the first time I played. Works great on the Kindle Fire.
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|I have seen this movie several times.  Since joining Prime,, this is the first movie I watched in its entirety. I've seen the longer version but found the original to be the best of the two. The movie tells the story of an Army Special ops captain assigned to destroy a friendly target.  It portrays the Vietnam war in stunning and very accurate fashion, it's a graphic movie, not for all viewers. This is a must see for all war buffs and fans. If you have not seen this movie yet, your in for a treat. So get the popcorn out and enjoy! A similar movie about The Vietnam Conflict which tells the story of a journalist called Full Metal Jacket is also a must see especially the boot camp scene. Both are excellent portrayals of war movies each with a different view of the era. If your up to a double feature these two movies won't disappoint. Enjoy. (Subject matter and graphic nature of both movies make them unsuitable for children.)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Still reading it, but really enjoying it. There are enough differences between the movie and the book to keep it interesting.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|i am a fan and i would watch it again.loved the storyline .wonderful .i want to buy it very soon.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is wonderful and fun especially for those who love doing makeup and making outfits. Girls love playing this especially five through twelve year-olds. Get this app and enjoy playing have fun

B00425S1H8|4.0|The tech support group helped me through an issue I had with rolling back the driver. It did function for my application.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game to play friends and others! Love playing. But the review part should not have a min word requirement.
B00BXI26XC|5.0|I sit on my deck and watch planes fly over - and always wonder where they're going.  Well, now I know that and a whole lot more!  I haven't used it as a specific flight tracker yet, but will the next time family members travel.  It is so much easier to use than the other Flight Tracker app I have.  Highly recommend for recreation - or practical purpose.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is great it is fun run running to no where so it is challenging and hard but fun
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I put this on a 125W 4-core Athlon.  Installation was simple and straightforward, and the instruction manual was available and looks decently helpful if you're lost.  It keeps my CPU very cool with just one fan, and it makes no noticeable sound, which is far better than the HSF that came with my processor.  I like that you can attach one or two standard 120MM fans of your choosing.  The included fan is good.  The price is good, and I recommend it to anyone, but especially if you have extra fans already, or are particular about your choice of fans.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So thankful fir the friends who recommended this book to me for a summer read!  I'll be passing it along right after my husband & 13 year old daughter read it.<br /><br />Great story!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|My husband kept insisting that i download this flashlight app. I did it to make him happy, figuring that i wouldn't use it. To my surprise i use it all the time and I love it! It is extremely bright! Ill never have to spend another dime on batteries for my old fashioned flash lights that are collecting dust around my house. They can't compare to this mighty app!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I had to wrap up the series. So, I read it. I'm not sure how I feel... The ending was not satisfying.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft pocket addition. I never had a minecraft on a x box or computer but this is fun! You can play in survival and free play modes. In survival you can battle monsters and fend yourself! In free play you can make whatever you want! You have an unlimited amount of blocks supplies and animals and you can fly! Even though its $6.99 its worth it!!!!!! I hope there will be more and more updates coming! I am very happy with minecraft! BUY IT NOW :) Sorry for the long message ;)
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I thought they'd get straight on the part when pie was on a boat with a tiger but it didn't.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I just picked this book up while browsing the kindle store and I am incredibly glad I did. I couldn't put it down for muchof the last half of the book. It got 4 stars rather than 5 only because I can't give out 5 stars to just any ol' thing. It's got to be special, not just enjoyable. That said, I can't recommend it any more highly. Great summer reading.
0792162803|4.0|It's OK, but I like it. Not crazy &#34;like it&#34; but like it. Tfhe main character acts out what comes to mind. Sort of like &#34;Walter Mitty&#34;. Molly is, in this movie sexy (I think) and hot!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My horse is crazy cool because you learn how to take care of horse's. You could use the knowledge on real horse's. So feed ,love ,and groom away and definitely play these game.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|Battery app works as advertised...not associated with adware and is consistently easy to use and understand.  Works great with kindle fire.
B009AMABH6|2.0|Imagine the scene. I'm driving back from York after Christmas with my family. It's a dull late-December afternoon and my only company is Kermode and Mayo's end of year film review. \\"Fine\\" I think. \\"They might mention something worth watching\\" so I settled (even further) into the driver's seat and tried to commit to memory some of the ones that get a special mention. And so it was that Cosmopolis and I came to meet.<br /><br />Imagine my shock when the soulless and ultimately meaningless story unfolded before me. There was dialog but very little of it sunk in. The cast had things to say but so what? What was actually conveyed...? The point of the story seemed to be: \\"The world's not really a very nice place\\", but this was hardly the most surprising message of 2012. I struggled to connect with any of the characters and failed completely to have any sympathy or empathy for them. The only scene that woke me slightly from my post-Christmas excesses was when the protestor got a good kicking for (let's face it) being worthy of getting a good kicking. Even the sex scenes weren't interesting enough to keep my attention from drifting to what I was going to have for dinner or whether it was going to snow again.<br /><br />You'll love this if you place arty-fartiness before genuine content but I'd be surprised if anyone, in a moment of boredom, might think \\"Hmmm, got a couple of hours to kill. I know...Cosmopolis...\\".<br /><br />Kermode. Mayo. What do they know...? ;o)
1423113462|4.0|I will begin my lukewarm review by saying that I'm only 120 pages in.  I haven't read the Percy Jackson series which seems to be the prequel series to this series.  ...and I am not a teenager; I'm nearly 40.  I do love quality children's literature or young adult fiction and I love the premise for the plot of this series.  Maybe I will love it by the time I'm done but so far I'm trying to stick with it but not loving it yet.<br /><br />The book has launched me into the drama of the character's world.  The world is interesting but the author hasn't given me an opportunity to become invested in the characters or their outcomes.  Compare, for a moment how we grow to appreciate Harry Potter's situation more and more as we unravel his world and by the time he is in peril, we care what happens to him and his friends.  True also for Chronicles of Narnia, A Wrinkle in Time, or even Charlotte's Web.  In The Lost Hero, suddenly in Chapter 1 everyone is in life-threatening peril and while there's plenty of character development and back story woven in as the perilous plot unfolds, somehow I just don't find myself caring much about the main characters.<br /><br />I also get the sense that I should have read the Percy Jackson series before reading this series.  Percy Jackson (and apparently his friends) are characters in this story so maybe it would all make more sense if I'd read that series first.  Who knew I had to read an entire series before starting book 1 of a new series?<br />-------<br />Having finished the book, I decided to edit my review and give it 4 stars instead of 3.  Eventually I got into the book and decided it was worth finishing, and even pretty well done.<br /><br />But I concluded that it would have been better to have read Percy Jackson first, before beginning this series which picks up where the Percy Jackson series starts off.  This latter (sequel) series doesn't exactly give away important plot elements from Percy Jackson except the big whopper that he's GONE MISSING!  And it drops you down into the middle of this alternate world which you have to now figure out, whereas I suspect the Percy Jackson series helps introduce you to the world as the main character discovers it.<br /><br />All in all, I think it's important to acknowledge that this book is probably very effective at reaching its intended audience: teenagers and tweeners.  As an adult with more sophisticated literary expectations, it felt a little too much like watching a TV melodrama series -- a compelling guilty-pleasure of a TV series -- but nonetheless, somewhat superficial and contrived.  I think it was the \\"modern teen dialog\\" that made it feel like I couldn't quite love it.<br /><br />But if you accept it for what it was, it was a decently entertaining book.  I'm not inspired to pick up the next in the series but if I were stuck on an 8-hour flight, I would be grateful to have this as entertaining reading material.
B004SKJTY6|4.0|The plot begins a bit slowly.  Do not be concerned, as the plot quickens and is very interesting.  It will keep your mind engaged and wondering what's next.  The acting is very good and provides an insight into the current Queen's family.  Enjoy!<br /><br />This is also the first Amazon movie I have streamed.  It was flawless!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|WONDERFUL I COULDN'T STOP READING IT.WRITE MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS PLEASE. CAN YOU TELL ME MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS .

B00005JNS0|5.0|Great show for any little one... Bought this for my kiddo and he fell in love with it. Now like most kids I have met that watch this show my little one has every character memorized and is a HUGE fan of the show. We have expanded and own a plethora of toys based on this movie and have had much magical fun.
1781162646|5.0|Don't be fooled by the pulpy-looking cover image; while there's certainly a ghost story, a serial killer and a couple well-written scares, Joyland isn't really about that.  When it comes down to it, this novel functions more as a way for King - through the narration of the title character, who is now an older man - to warmly reflect on the perils of being a young, heartbroken 20-something, and to reminiscence on the way that life - and time - never ceases to change us.<br /><br />Joyland is a touching reminder of the tenderness of youth, the pain of heartbreak and the joy of new beginnings. While this novel won't be remembered in the same light as some of King's all-time classics - and that's okay, considering just how many amazing books he's written! - it does deserve to be given a look, and is a wonderful example of King at his best.  Crazy as it sounds, the man really is just getting better and better.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|No complaints from me, the ethernet adapter  arrived as described in a relatively good amount of time and does what it says it does.

B0087ITBPC|3.0|I was hoping for more comedy that it had. It did not hold my interest. I would not recommend this movie
B00DWV3NM6|4.0|With the new wave of consoles and graphically intensive games coming out in the near future, I decided it was time to upgrade from my tired Gigabyte GTX 580 - while the 580 was getting the job done, its performance is easily surpassed by the GTX 660Ti at this time, and its only going to get worse.  Using Asus for most of the components in my computer and knowing their reliability in the marketplace, I decided to go with Asus this time instead of a competitor like EVGA's GTX 780 with ACX cooler.  I should note that I decided to use an aftermarket cooler solution, like the DirectCU II in this video card, over the reference cooler NVidia uses as I have a lot of positive airflow in my case and I knew I would benefit from having an open cooler design like this.<br /><br />The packaging of the card makes it feel very premium - the exterior box is a cardboard box, but the interior box is very high quality and premium feeling.  When you open it, you find a black folio with the Asus logo on it which contains the driver and GPU tweak software, a Multilanguage instruction manual, an SLI bridge, and a PCIe power connector splitter (which splits an 8pin connector to 2 six pin connectors).  Below the folio is a high density foam layer protecting the video card, which is wrapped in an anti static bag.  The card has sufficient foam protecting it on all sides, so any sort of shipping gaffe should be ok, though I don't recommend throwing the box on the ground.<br /><br />The physical card is certainly very premium looking and feeling - the new racing stripe design on the card is eye catching (though you're probably only going to see it once after you install it).  The card is HEAVY and LONG - make sure you have adequate space in your case for installation.  The inclusion of the backplate on the card is a welcomed touch, as the heft of the card will no doubt cause it to sag over time without it.  I can say that the card does weigh more than my old Gigabyte GTX 580 windforce.  Installation is straightforward as with any video card, and it takes up 2 slots on your motherboard and case.  The card does also come with plastic covers for the PCIe connection and the SLI bridge connection areas, ensuring they aren't damaged during shipping or handling.<br /><br />Installation of the driver package and GPU tweak software was easy and straightforward, and after a reboot, everything on my computer was back to the way it was prior to installation.  The GPU Tweak software will set itself to run when windows starts up, but you can disable this in the settings.  Within the software is the ability to monitor pretty much all aspects of the card from GPU frequency to load, fan speed, GPU temperature and more.  From a tweaking standpoint, you have the options to increase the boost clock, the GPU voltage, the memory clock, power target, card temperature targets, fan speed, and display refresh setting.  For me, I have only really increased the boost clock at this time.<br /><br />Comparing my old gaming with the GTX 580 to this now is a whole new world - even gaming at 1080p resolutions like I do, I am now able to truly max everything out on the games I am playing (Battlefield 3, Planetside 2, StarCraft II, Borderlands 2, and others) without having any issues with frames dipping low.  From a noise and temperature standpoint, I would say that audibly, the card is quieter than my old GTX 580, which is nice.  GPU temps have not gotten over 62 degrees for me at this time, which is also a welcomed changed from the hot GTX 580.<br /><br />My only deduction is on the price - $700 is a lot of money for a video card, especially when in years past, the GeForce x80 line has been set at $500.  While you are certainly getting a lot more performance for dollar compared to the Titan, it is a lot to shell out.<br /><br />Overall, this card is extremely well built and will last me years of enjoyable gaming to come - great build quality, easy to use software, and excellent performance make this card a worthy purchase of anyone looking at upgrading to the GTX 780 line.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Agreed:  Challenging but not too difficult.  I'm sad it ended, as I would have liked to play more. I wish the game could remember and return to where I left off instead of having to start the level from the beginning again, but not a huge problem.<br />:)
B002PEP4C8|4.0|In Lucky Alice Sebold tells her story of being raped and bringing charges against her rapist. Although not always enjoyable, it is a gripping read. Lucky gives a firsthand portrait of how people perceive and respond to a rape victim, and the toll that takes on the one who has been raped. Not an easy read, but insightful and well written.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I loved this movie it was entertaining. The human tragedy that the main character was subject to, pulled at my heartstrings. The story is wonderfully told be the main character and I fell it was well done.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|The Stones, or their record companies, to be exact, have been putting these out since \\"High Tide and Green Grass\\" in 1964... I can't count how many comps have come out with mostly the same songs. The excuse for this one is their 50th anniversary. And there are two new songs on here, so for completists, you might want this. If you don't have a Stones comp, this one is as good as any other. In reality, they could put out a 10-cd sampler and there would still be many great songs missing. The best way to hear the Stones is on their individual albums, of which not one is bad. They are all excellent, even the 1967 Beatles copy, \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request,\\" which some say was their worst. I like it, however.
B000003CMC|5.0|this is truly one of the all-time greatest American rock classics!  of course, it's well remembered for its sad historical significance.  it's the album they were recording when duane allman died in a motorcycle accident.  but the widely held rumor that the album got its name because duane collided with a freight truck carrying peaches is untrue.  duane's bike ran into a lumber truck.  but the album title was meant to be a tribute to duane because it was a quote from his last interview with the press in '71.  when asked what he was doing for the revolution, duane replied, \\"there is no revolution.  it's an evolution...and every time i'm in Georgia, I eat a peach for peace.\\"  that is how this album was named in tribute to duane.  I don't want to over-talk this album, because i'm sure it's been done many times by people who can discuss the music better than I, but this is a great work that deserves its classic status!  I believe the inclusion of the live tracks from the recently recorded live at fillmore east sessions was an afterthought because the album was incomplete when they lost duane, and they weren't ready to leave him behind.  that includes the elmore james cover & big radio hit 'one way out', the muddy waters cover 'trouble no more' and the 33-minute instrumental album highlight called 'mountain jam'.  and one of the sweet things of the cd age is that we finally get to hear mountain jam uninterrupted.  in the vinyl age, the tune had to be divided between 2 album sides.  I love having this tune all in one piece!<br />  blues-driven southern rock, instrumental jazz/rock fusion, a touch of country in dickey betts' tune 'blue sky' and the short acoustic guitar instrumental named 'little martha', which is the last tune duane wrote and recorded before his passing....and a nice way to end the album.  i'm sorry duane had to leave us, but this album was a great way to go out!  again, this is still one of the all-time greatest American rock classics......and the allman brothers band certain earned their title as the godfathers of southern rock with this spectacular album!brothers band certain earned their title as the godfathers of southern rock with this spectacular album!
B005SDMDRW|2.0|The makings of a good Bosch story -- I;m a bit of a Bisch fan -- but it is unfinished, stiopping three quarters way through. Then comes a list of Connelly promos. not good
B001VIMCW4|1.0|This was among the worst efforts I have seen. The director and producer should be ashamed of this mish-mash of gibberish. I rate virtually every aspect of this film at the lowest possible grade.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|It is a lot of fun also and the candy lines are fast and fun they really move and some times it is hard to see which ones need to be clicked on!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A good read. Makes you think about humanity and what it means to be human in a new light. Nice.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|Decent book. Excellent for those in business, especially with multiple employees. The reason I didn't rate it higher is because I rather disagree with some of the philosophy; but the overall concept is quite good.
B003XDZMPY|2.0|I had a pair of size 7 Crocs Mary Janes and ordered these to replace them. The old ones were almost too loose; these I almost couldn't get my feet into. I even checked the tag to make sure they were women's and not children's sizes. The size difference was ridiculous. So disappointing.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Excellent for toddlers. Easy for them to learn how to solve the puzzle. Love the encouraging sounds and visuals at the end. A good variety of puzzles to solve as well.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|The story of a true hero and member of the elite Tier 1 Special Forces community. Adam Brown's story should be read by everyone who thinks they have what it takes... I wasn't able to put this down.
B005LAII80|5.0|A simple story line but very well told. Action throughout, good flow, nice soundtrack mixed with great slow-mo shots.<br />Overall a great movie. Good enough to add to my collection.<br /><br />I would love to see a sequel. Please sign the petition for a sequel :<br /><br />[...]
B007IXWKUK|4.0|My Initial Reaction...<br /><br />I'm glad I gave this book a chance after having very mixed feelings about the first book. Fifty Shades Darker, the second book in the series, is a big improvement on the first book. Everything I didn't like about the first book was improved upon in this one.<br /><br />The Characters...<br /><br />One of my biggest complaints about Fifty Shades of Grey was the characters - they seemed unbelievable and they didn't compel me to care about them. While I won't pretend that the characters have suddenly transformed into the most compelling every written, they do make leaps and bounds.<br /><br />The transformation of Christian is the most pronounced; we start to see him as more than a fantasy character (in that he's not just some incredible billionaire humanitarian with an incredibly troubled sexy side who never seems to work like in the first book). Instead we begin to see his vulnerable underbelly, especially as he tries to relinquish control a bit.<br /><br />Ana too develops as a character; she's coming into herself and starting to blossom from the innocent girl, so out of her element and completely drowning under the dominance of Christian, into an empowered young woman willing and ready to speak her mind. This came through best in their emails back and forth to each other; Ana clearly felt more daring with the distance emailing provided. It was a unique (and fairly dominant) element in this book that I really enjoyed. So much of their relationship's improvement and growth was through the communication these emails provide.<br /><br />The Story...<br /><br /> The plot was much better than in book one as well. We pick up right were book one ended, with Ana feeling tortured by their breakup (even though she was the one who ended it). I can say, without spoiling anything for you, that they get back together because it happens very quickly. I have to admit to being a little skeptical at the speed of their reunion, but this is a romance dependent very much on their steamy encounters; the book would have probably dragged if they stayed apart too long.<br /><br />Their new relationship is different from the former, though. Because of the ways both Christian and Ana are growing as characters it's the start of a healthier relationship. Their sexual relationship has also grown (or perhaps the author has grown?); not only did it not overwhelm the pages but underwhelm me like before, the moments were more carefully chosen and much better written.<br /><br />There is an actual conflict this time too! I was pleasantly surprised to see people from Christian's past popping up to cause trouble for the couple to overcome, not to mention the semi-expected obstacle of Jack, Ana's boss. There's a mystery to solve and danger to overcome, making this a much more exciting read than the first book.<br /><br />Concluding Sentiments...<br /><br />I didn't expect it, but I'm now addicted to Ana and Charles. The growth in their characters is tremendous and the vulnerability that they both show is so endearing. It's an erotic story to be sure, but with this book I believe it's become something more. If you weren't sure after the first book, put aside your doubts; Christian and Ana will convince you that theirs is a love story you want to know.ependent very much on their steamy encounters; the book would have probably dragged if they stayed apart too long.<br /><br />Their new relationship is different from the former, though.

B00526ZKYS|4.0|This book starts fast, but slows way down in the middle...but the last 80% really licks up and leaves you wanting more.  There are several disjointed parts in the story with the best friend character, and I would have liked their relationship to have been more developed.  But the ending is good and makes perfect sense.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Though different but not different. A well written and maintained story line. In a world of real but make believe. Great characters and story.
0316017930|5.0|This was a very interesting book. After my son read it for his AP Stats class I read it to and really liked it.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Loved watching this movie and part 1. Would recommend to any and all Batman fans. The Batman/Superman battle is EPIC.
B005DJREJS|1.0|I never heard of this show.  I noticed it among the other choices on Amazon. It looked quite funny.  I was shocked at the way it portrays high school students.  No one wants their son or daughter to act this way.<br /><br />I know at the time it is fun, but look at the pain of those cast aside and used.  I would like to see a funny show that inspires.<br /><br />Of course there are funny moments in the show.  Good characters and writing but do teenagers need to be encouraged to live this way?  To be popular does a girl need to have sex?<br /><br />I watched 3 or 4 shows.
B00C2C637I|5.0|i found ray bradbury's descriptive style and creation of images unique and very compelling. such an amazing story of lifes challenges and struggles.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun. It's challenging and if you like to be challenged you'll love it!! I give it five stars!
B002VECMAE|5.0|The cast was great and the movie plot was a bit different.  (Spoiler) It's kind of a different way of looking a psyhic abilities in a humorous way.
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|received this today in perfect condition. I'm listening to disc 6,a full disc of live recordings from the mellon collie tour.<br />it's 6 CDS full of great stuff:remastered songs sound stellar,rehearsals,alternate versions and LIVE recordings.the live stuff is the highlight here.<br />the pumpkins were a powerful live band.it shows throughout this box set.these songs live gives them whole new life.<br />the songs from the original set sounds fresh and noticeably better than on the original box.<br />so yeah,this is worth the money and more.if you like or love the pumpkins this will bring you happiness in spades.<br />now to watch the DVD.peace.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book in this trilogy is very erotic.  I could not put it down until I finished the entire book  I am looking forward to reading the third book to see how Christian deals with Anastasia's boss Jack.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved the last version of the app but the new one is awful and hard to use. I think I will uninstall it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game keeps your interest and moves quickly.  It doesn't demand you spend $$ but some things will be easier if you do. All in it is a 5 star game for me.  I will be watching for more games from this company.
068987474X|4.0|Funny.  Self-denial is a killer.  This book breaks it down in a funny, non-offensive matter.  The movie wasn't as funny.
B00821OX98|5.0|I really like this series. It has sci-fi, action, military, and drama aspects with a splash of comedy relief mixed really well together.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|On the other hand it was pretty entertaining. Pretty much what you would expect. Not much noteworthy acting but it was intended to be summer filler.<br /><br />I would recommend it as a fun movie night event.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I wanted to be able to watch some of my regular subscriptions since it wasn't working through the internet and after about two videos it wouldn't work and would buffer every 5 seconds.

1400069807|4.0|This book opens your eye how marketing and money have changed the food we eat.  Money is most important not people, their  nutrition, good health and lives as the story unfolds.<br />An interesting fact is home economic teachers were the food giants enemies.  And now look at the schools home economics departments.  Even colleges switched to family consumer science.  CONSUMER<br /><br />I do not think you can understand this book and its contents until you read it.  The author is not telling you what to do, he is just telling you about the JUNK we have to eat and drink in 2013 in the United States. No wonder our health is bad and we have fat people.<br />It should e required reading the the junior high schools.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I love this set.  Everthing was in excellent condition and I really enjoyed watching the original series with Jim, Spock and McCoy.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I think I would enjoy it just a bit more if I didn't 't have to avail myself of the walkthrough on YouTube!  The game could at least contain a few minor hints; especially after you have poked all over the screen with few results!  Otherwise,  I love these types of games.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Many women have portrayed Queen Victoria but Emily Blunt has been one of the very best to do so. Her Albert in this movie is fabulous too, handsome and assertive in a most charming and appealing way . Romantics and lovers of Victoria and that era of English history will love this film. The whole cast is wonderful and the locations lavish and beautiful. Emily IS Victoria! SO well done!
B009LK6JS2|5.0|i am really impressed with simulation and app it self. I really love the airfield and the lights how they light up and overall it is awesome. it is especially easy to steer.
0307720748|5.0|This is a fun and exciting book written by a great entrepreneur. I had no idea his life was so interesting! I feel very inspired after reading this book and have developed enormous respect for Richard Branson -- he is so modest, intelligent, and fun-loving that he certainly makes me want to do something great.<br /><br />Even if you aren't interested in the world of business, you'll find this a highly entertaining read! There's a lot of adventuring, intercontinental hot air ballooning, etc.
0938045768|5.0|This book is awesome! A lot of common sense and an excellent resource for bodyweight exercises. It focuses on mastering 6 compound exercises: one arm pushup, one arm pullup, one legged squat, leg raise, one arm handstand pushups, and the bridge. While the book is expensive and has many type-o's, WORTH THE MONEY. Bodyweight exercises are ideal for gaining true strength and reducing injuries. Book is priceless!

Great graphics, fun gameplay, and capable of playing with and making friends. Gameloft has a done a superb job and i intend on watching for new releases from this developer.

B00CXQL828|5.0|Kotzen, Sheehan, Portnoy!! Anybody who knows those names should know the talent of this trio!!<br /><br />Tight, well written, and well-played!! Kotzen's voice is one of the best in hard rock, and of course his lead guitar coupled with a beast of a rhythm section well...you know how great they are!!<br /><br />Worth the hype, and a must buy!!!

B000HIVOFU|2.0|This is NOT the \\"World's Greatest Audiophile Vocal Recordings\\" and NOT worth $38.  The performances, mostly jazz and pop are done well and recorded very well, they are Audiophile quality recordings but the World's Greatest Vocal?  Not in any way shape or form.  These may be the best performances of talented singers in their current catalogue.  I would have been delighted I if spent $3.80 (4 stars), But instead I am feeling very let down, hence 2 stars for the price.<br /><br />Randomly buy any Linn Super, Telarc, Mobile Fidelity used and you will get a much better deal.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|um, i had to read this book for school, so i dont really like this book but it was ok.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It had some funny parts and feel good moments. I know some parents of my students who are just like Barbara's character!
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|In the extras on the DVD, director Dustin Hoffman and some of the cast members say that this film is about living life completely, about continuing with life even in old age. That may be, but what makes this film wonderful is not the message but the cast. Maggie Smith is, as always, magnificent as the diva who no longer sings because she realizes that her best days are behind her but who listens to her own recordings (but denies doing so). Michael Gambon (the second Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films) shines as the director of the annual show to fund the home for retired musicians. Trevor Peacock (whom many will remember as the \\"No, no, no, no, no, yes\\" man from [[ASIN:B000SINSX0 The Vicar of Dibley]] is always a welcome treat.<br /><br />But the star of the show, at least in my eyes, is Billy Connolly, the forever flirtatious would-be lothario. In the commentary, Hoffman notes that Connolly was hesitant to take the role since he thought he would not be in the same class as the other cast members. Hoffman notes that Connolly underestimated his talents. I would add \\"seriously\\" before \\"underestimated.\\"<br /><br />The plot itself is not exactly new, and there are few twists here. But the magnificent cast makes the plot almost secondary. Finally, one touching note is that over the closing credits, pictures of many of the cast members appear, both as they are in the film and as they were during their heyday. It's sobering to think just what an amazing assembly of talent Hoffman was able to bring to this film.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Hours of entertainment!<br />Love this game. Only drawback for Kindle is that it takes up a lot of its memory. This game gives you a challenge in that you've. got to work out your next move.
0062255657|1.0|I could not believe how this book went nowhere.  Confusing without any explanation and not a care for any of the characters.  What a disappointment from such a well published author.  I always finish any book I start to read and thankfully it was a short book.
4862333672|4.0|These illustrations are contained in two books including, for one, colored, detailed art and material whether it be official monster designs, prototypes that never made the cut, armor, weapons, characters with the high quality level Capcom provides when one of their artbook is released. Truly beautiful to read.<br />The second book pretty much like the first tome which was released years earlier, deals with rough sketches inside and is slighly less attractive but provides interresting insight for people fluent in japanese.<br />If you loved MH world especially the third generation games like MH Tri, Portable 3rd or Tri G Ultimate, this is definitely a book to own.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I liked the old app. This revision is loaded with distracting junk!  I use this app for WEATHER. Weather is not a game.  I do not expect, or desire to collect points for checking the weather.  The next revision needs a setting to revert to the old user interface, where the app just displays WEATHER information in a clear, easily understood format.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I thought this was a  great app and used it every day.<br />After a recent version change, it has become less easy to find the info I want.<br />Too bad.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|App works well and is easy to navigate. Just like the website but with a lot of good shortcuts. Everything is easy to read as well.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|First things first: I know that cutting glass is not an everyday skill or ability.  I went into this purchase thinking I would be ok after working in a shop that cut mirrors to shape for installation in homes, even so far as to cut outlet holes in mirror that will be used in a bathroom.  My prior experience was of no use whatsoever. Despite rigorously following directions (and saving various types of bottles in anticipation of this product) I have not yet produced one good cut.  I have oiled the scoring blade, boiled and rapidly cooled glass, assured perfect angles with a level, applied even pressure and rotated each bottle against the cutter instead of moving the contraption all to no avail.  To those of you who have achieved the expected result I salute you.  I was really looking forward to being super-green and reusing anything I could.  I have a lot of small plants that I thought had future homes in something I made but will be living in something store bought until the genie that was supposed to arrive with this glass cutter shows up and grants me the knowledge needed to make it work.

B000QFQE4U|5.0|I didn't know a whole bunch about Malcolm X and having to teach civil rights this summer to middle school kids, I thought I would do a little homework.  This is a fabulous film.  The acting is excellent and the film tells a great story of the life of this man and his role in the civil rights movement.  I was blown away.  Spike Lee did a fabulous job with this film and was a great character in the movie as well.  It is amazing how much Denzel Washington looked like Malcolm X in the film!  I highly recommend this film.
B00BHUB11Y|4.0|My daughter asks to watch it all the time. It is very entertaining and she is just hypnotized time after time.

B008JFUR10|4.0|Pacific Rim is quite possibly the heaviest hitting summer blockbuster this year (by a good several thousand tons, to be precise). It's led by Guillermo del Toro, bringing together a somewhat lopsided cast with a promising story and a premise that's been proven since 1954.<br /><br />The film starts off with a bang, setting up the story of the big, evil monsters (called Kaiju, a Japanese word meaning \\"Giant Beast\\"), and the big, good robots (called Jaegers, a German word meaning \\"Hunter\\") within the first few seconds a la green, dot matrix text. Raleigh sets up the story, explains the Jaegers and their dual-pilot system over the next few minutes. The film does a good job of keeping its pace fast without losing the audience in unnecessary plot sinks or Jaeger jargon.<br /><br />Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy) plays the lead role of Raleigh Becket, a Jaeger pilot who lost his brother in the Kaiju War, damaged goods that finds himself two steps shy of Jake Sully from Avatar. Yet piloting half of Gipsy Danger and fighting on behalf of his copilot (played by Asian film star Rinko Kikuchi), Hunnam shines, and makes the rest of the cast look good while doing it. Rival Jaeger pilot Chuck Hansen (played by the British soap star Robert Kazinsky) does an excellent job of being a perfect ass when he needs to be. Del Toro adds in Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as two rival scientists with vastly different theories for dealing with the Kaiju problem (for comic releif and an action packed side story) and Ron Pearlman as a black market mastermind. Also making a special cameo, Ellen McLain provides her electronic voice for GLaDOS... I mean, the Jaeger AI.<br /><br />Pacific Rim's faults are minor, and might have kept it from being a hit any other year. However, with the stale competition in theaters coming from R.I.P.D., it remains the only mid-summer film worth watching.
B00CCEHX5W|5.0|First of all I must give you a little back story. When Deafheaven came out with Roads to Judah I found a rare vinyl copy, and purchased it having never heard the band before. That LP has gotten one rotation on my turntable,and never since. I was not impressed by that record at all. It was just more of the same old hipster USBM. When Sunbather was announced, the press was all over it. Everywhere you looked in magazines, the internet, record stores, people were talking about this record coming out, and I could not have cared less. Well, it's been out for a little while now, and due to the constant barrage of positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot. Based on my opinion of Roads to Judah, I thought this would be a total waste of money. That was where I was dead wrong. This album immediately captivates you with a swirling guitar and drum sound that says this ride will be different. As I listened to Sunbather for the first time I couldn't help but to think what a great name for an album this is. If Black Metal usually reminds you of icy forests, corpse paint, and nails pushed through leather armbands, these songs will send you a new direction. This is like \\"summer metal\\", or \\"beach metal\\" to me. Not in a campy sense, but in the sense that it makes me visualize waves crashing, bright sun shining, and sitting in the sand alone while reflecting on your past, and enjoying the solitude. The songs are very melodic, but more like a soundtrack than an actual song. It is easy to get absorbed in this music, and it is really quite captivating. Before I bought this, I listened to some samples of it and was not impressed. Now I know that you really need to sit down and listen to this from start to finish. The hour goes by in fifteen minutes. There are so many things I could say about this, but I would just keep repeating myself by trying to get my point across. Bottom line is that Sunbather is getting great reviews because it is a truly great album, and a must-own. Do yourself afavor and just buy this. If you are hesitant, just buy this. If you are afraid of wasting your money, just buy this. Some people have said that this band is too hipster-y. Well, yes, it is hipster music. If that keeps you from experiencing this record it is a shame. (and a very hipster mentality). Since listening to Sunbather it really makes me wonder if Roads to Judah is another masterpiece just sitting in my record pile and I don't even know it? I'm going to find out...

B008TRUDAS|4.0|Okay, I'll forgive the Michigan weather misunderstandings that jumped out early in the story since I was quickly absorbed into the tale without another thought of abnormal snow in southern Michigan in September. (September is still swim in the lake weather, and too hot to wear all the freshly purchased new school clothes)<br /><br />Young adult romance is not my favorite genre, but the high ratings pushed me to give this book a try.  Teens believe that they are the center of the universe, that their life is the most important thing and that if things do not go according to \\"the perfect plan\\", then whining begins (which is a MAJOR turnoff to me and why I could not stand reading Twilight).<br />However, things do not fall perfectly in place for Lake.  Her father dies, she is uprooted from her home in Texas to live in Michigan, and she is denied her true love.  Yes, she throws several fits and even does some whining, but technically that is realistic, as she is in that transitional time where a teen thinks they are an all-knowing adult but in actuality they have a lot of maturing left.<br /><br />What made this a good book for me, really wasn't the storyline, or the forbidden romance, but it was the author's ability to completely absorb me into characters and places that I could perfectly visualize and imagine.

B009NY43NY|3.0|The past two books have felt somewhat forced, so I didn't expect much for this one. It didn't feel rushed like series finales often do, and all loose ends were addressed.
B00DFFI7K2|2.0|Whilst some may argue that the GI Joe movie strayed too far from the original material, it was a fun romp where lots of stuff exploded and you got the feel.  The sequel, in trying to go back to the source material, sacrificed everything that was interesting and fun about the first one and replaced it with a forced, contrived piece.  It looks as if they took a step back 20 years in technology just to get the toys in the movie. Seriously?  90 minutes of my life I can never get back...
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Excellent read<br />I downloaded the book yesterday and today I did nothing but read and munched on tomato sandwiches<br />I recommend highly
B008JFUO36|2.0|I don't know what I expected from this movie, but this one just laid there and went no where.  I was irritated by the character Victoria and her calling \\"Jack\\" 100 billion times!!

076790592X|3.0|Just finished the book this morning. On the whole I enjoyed it as a quick, feel good read that raised some larger questions. I apologize in advance if this comes across as overly pessimistic, however, it's in my nature to provide a counterbalance to what I perceive to be a syrupy sweet, and slightly unrealistic feel-good story.<br /><br />First of all I'd like to say that I agree with many of the conclusions that Morrie reaches regarding the \\"right\\" way to live, ie. all you need is love, people shouldn't work so hard, consumerism is bad, etc. However, from what Mitch tells us, Morrie never really valued these things at any point in his life, rather, his old beliefs are merely solidified when confronted with the prospect of death.<br /><br />I found it interesting that he repeatedly expressed disapproval concerning the pursuit of wealth and career ambition at the cost of leisure spent with family and friends, while being attended to by his hired servants and healthcare professionals, made possible by the very personal accumulation of wealth that he derides throughout the book. I'd be curious to know if his bright outlook on his situation would have remained had he not worked and accumulated the wealth and social status necessary to sustain his care from home those last few months. As a healthcare professional, I can tell you from experience that the overwhelming majority of people do NOT have the luxury to spend their last days like Morrie. I'll wager that every person that reads this would prefer to die peacefully at home surrounded by loved ones, yet very, very few people get to experience this; the reality for most people is far more grim. Does the exceptional financial circumstance that Morrie created for himself allow for exceptional deathbed philosophy? At this point in my reflection, I think that it does. I'm going to guess that dying as a highly respected, well-to-do Boston professor is a bit easier than dying as a highly respected, yet indebted laborer who is a current and future financial burden on his family. I'd love to hear his perspective to see if he reaches the same conclusions as Morrie. I can say from experience that finances were a huge concern for my father as he was dying. Providing for me and my mother was something in which he took great pride.<br /><br />The point I'm trying to make is that I think some of the themes in the book are a bit too oversimplified. I've focused on Morrie's financial wisdom in this review, but I believe this applies to the rest of the life lessons as well. Dying is a complex process, as a result, everyone eventually reaches their own conclusions. I believe there are some core truths that apply to life, though I wouldn't rely on this book to find them in their entirety. However, it is thought provoking and a good starting point to begin evaluating your life and asking the big questions about what really matters.<br /><br />I'd just like to be clear that I mean no disrespect to Morrie or his family. I get the impression that he was a lovely man. I'm merely a guy trying to figure out what really matters in life as I try to strike a balance between pursuing career and money, family, and play. Comments are welcome and appreciated as long as they are constructive. Thanks
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is out of the world it is an awesome game because you can flip, go strait or fail each level starts to become easy every time you do that level also you can loose you riders on the track but no worries you can go back wards and get them again

B0064W65SO|5.0|I have been  a fan of Batman since as long as I could remember and I will continue to love his exploits until I'm dead. My opinion on the book, the artwork and the storyline work together in a way only Miller could have made it so. It's a masterpiece for any and all generations and the way it is written, no crazy clown killer, no buttons with a burnt face and a split personality, just Batman going up against corruption in the police and the mob bosses and druggies they work for. One of the most realistic Batman adventures I have ever read!!
B00005RG6B|5.0|I had this when it first came out as a VHS/CD box set after seeing the band live on the Building Empires tour. While there's no substitute for the live experience as it was back then (as opposed to the current setup), this is a very fine representation of the show with a great mix and fine camera work. It's not widescreen as 16:9 wasn't happening when it was shot and since it was never meant to be anything other than a longform video, it is what it is.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|fun and addictive game.  I recommend this game for anyone over the age of ten.  it keeps you guessing the whole time.

B005DN5BE4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.  The Djimon is a fantastic actor and stole the show for me.  His acting was superb and so relevant to this story and held me captive as I watched this movie.  This man should have won an Oscar for this role...

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Why oh why do apps have to be changed when they worked perfectly well before the change? This app was so easy to use. I had the app on my phone so I decided to put it on my Kindle Fire. With the new changes, I am still having a hard time figuring it out. I am very disappointed with the new changes.

1594204217|4.0|For those familiar with Michael Pollan, this is certainly more of the same.  Same good writing and same focus on food, which Pollan rightly recognizes as a key part of human development and culture.  Others have criticized this work as tedious and repetitive, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Granted, it is not a pot-boiling page-turner.  It is a well researched, thought provoking, look at the creation and evolution of ways to transform raw plant and animal material into tasty and healthy nutrition for the human animal.  He also highlights the cultural and social aspects of cooking as key elements of our human development.  Both the food transformation and the cultural/social aspects of cooking are losing importance in western societies. Pollan argues this is to our collective detriment.<br /><br />Reading this thoughtful book may not make you change your food purchase and consumption habits -- and it's certainly not likely to make you a master chef, baker, brewer, etc. -- but it will give you a new perspective on the place that cooking has held in our past.  A place that may or may not remain so important in the future.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|The Temple Grandin story is fascinating in how it unfolds a character that is brilliant but under-valued. Temple learns how to come out of herself more than others learn to teach her the skill. Its about opportunity and how those experiences effect our lives. This DVD captivates, brings hope and enlightens not only those who deal with autistic people, but for all of us who fail to reach our potential because we haven't experienced those situations that may bring out the best in each of us. A true story of finding the potential within all of us.
1451627289|5.0|This is the best novel I have read in a long, long time. King is at the peak (again, lol) of his immense writing talent with this book. It's not a horror novel exactly, more suspense with a science fiction element, as loose as this latter might be. There are plenty of scares, but not of the \\"boo! ahhh!\\" variety. King is SO good as character building, you find yourself panicking as main character Jake Epping (aka George Amberson) finds himself in some amazingly-suspenseful moments. This is made all the more impressive considering this entire novel is written as a first-person account of main character Jake. Hard to sometimes build suspense when you're being narrated to by the character. But every person around him is so real - and thus the reader quickly empathizes with them - you have concern for their safety and well-being.<br /><br />This is also a really nice love story. Though this piece of the story doesn't kick in until well into the book, it becomes a major driver throughout the remainder.<br /><br />The motion is this book is constantly moving forward, never feeling bogged down or slow (with one exception: when Jake begins staking out Lee Oswald's life, the story seemed to slow down because I really wasn't interested in that character... eventually this changed, but initially I wanted a change of scenery pretty quickly).<br /><br />It's a long book, and rich in well-researched detail that never seems overburdening. King doesn't drown you in details of the historical US, but instead immerses you in the world, with such detail I honestly think I know what it smelled, felt and tasted like to live in the late 50's and early 60's.<br /><br />Bummed that it finally ended at last, but it was such a wonderful, wild ride. Highly, highly recommend it.

B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I personally don't really enjoy the game but for kids smaller than me i think it would be great. By the way I also don't like that you only have the option of playing with the two characters that you start with, I think that you shouldn't have to buy all the special stuff. :)
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good update to the app, but it needs some tweaking, like showing day and night photos when checking the weather plus ways of changing settings more.

B008SAZHLQ|2.0|After reading great reviews on amazon - and because I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;the attachments&#34; - I eagerly picked up &#34;eleanor & park.&#34;<br /><br />The beginning of the book was excellent. Who doesn't remember the awkwardness of high school, trying to fit in or to go unnoticed? Rowell did a lovely job of capturing what it must feel like to be new and unattractive in a small town.<br /><br />But the book quickly takes a turn and brings two unlikely characters together. My problem was that not only did I not find the Park/Eleanor romance believable, but I did not buy into the subplot of Eleanor's past and current home life.<br /><br />Much is left unexplained (POTENTIAL SPOILER):<br />Why did Eleanor's parents split up?<br />How did they loose all of their money?<br />Why were there so many kids?<br />How did Park go from ringing Eleanor so ugly to beautiful?<br />How did he become a kid who wore make-up?<br />Was the locker room cruelty done by the same person writing the offensive notes (and if so, how?!)?<br /><br />Too much didn't work for me, which was mainly disappointing because the beginning really sucked me in.

The app must be opened to find out all email has been read or deleted from the inbox. Unacceptable in my opinion. Google's app don't require this, why should Yahoo's?
B009GI8J1O|5.0|Cloud Atlas is unlike any book I've read. It follows a nested structure: Story A, Story B, Story C, Story D, Story E, Story F, then back to Story E, Story, D, ..., Story A. The stories are totally different, from a lawyer aboard a ship a century ago to a man in a post-apocalyptic future. Mitchell constructs different voices in each story, and he even constructs different dialects for Stories F (the post-apocalyptic future) and E (the corpocratic future).  Each story is engaging, and the stories are linked with a light touch - the composer in Story B discovers the journal of the lawyer in Story A; the clone in Story E watches a movie about the life of the publisher in Story D. (Several of the characters have a birthmark in common as well.)<br /><br />The book is ambitious and it pulls off its coup: Mitchell creates six engaging stories and keeps me involved enough to wade to the center and back out again. His prose is great, and occasionally I even enjoyed an insight. For examples of the former, consider \\"Only the trombonist played on. That's trombonists for you\\", \\"People are obscenities. Would rather be music than be a mass of tubes squeezing semisolids around itself for a few decades becoming so dribblesome it'll no longer function\\", speaking of publishing - \\"Translation rights fell like territories in the final round of Risk\\", and \\"Never apologize, advises Lloyd George. Say it again, only this time, ruder.\\" I smiled at a scene where a composer is writing a piece that has the same structure as the novel in which he is a character: \\"Revolutionary or gimmicky? Shan't know until it's finished, and by then it'll be too late.\\"<br /><br />For the latter, consider \\"I'm a spent firework; but at least I've been a firework,\\" \\"no state of tyranny reigns forever,\\" \\"Why fight the `natural' (oh, weaselly word!) order of things,\\" and \\"What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?\\", and \\"so busy planning his next boorish interruption that he never listens properly,\\" \\"if consumers found fulfillment at any meaningful level, she xtemporized, corpocracy would be finished,\\" \\"They bicker, blame, and grieve as people will, but at least they do it in a community, and companionship is a fine medicine in itself,\\" and - on originality in art - \\"'But it's been done a hundred times before!'--as if there could be anything not done a hundred thousand times between Aristophanes and Andrew Void-Webber! As if Art is the What, not the How!)\\"<br /><br />Mitchell has a nice post-script in which he describes seeing his book made into a movie. I appreciated this line: \\"Film adaptations of novels are sometimes prone to failure because they are not too faithless but too faithful: Why spend all that effort producing an audiobook with pictures?\\"<br /><br />I really liked it, although it took me a bit of work. (I tried the audiobook first but couldn't start a third plot in that format, so I switched to the print book, then the ebook.)<br /><br />Note on content: Various references to sex, but no explicit descriptions.

When propped up it does seem to slide<br />on a smooth surfaces.  Wish they didn't charge more for the colored ones.
1609611543|5.0|I'm astonished with the ease of weight loss I am experiencing by following Dr. Davis' diet plan--but for me easy weight control is secondary to the reason I am writing this review.  I had a wound infection that would not heal.  My wound care specialist MD treated me and warned me that my slow healing and my \\"Wheat Belly\\" signaled that I was a likely candidate for diabetes.  I complained of my struggle with weight control and that in the last four years I had gained over 40 lbs.  He asked me if I noticed the common denominator of the patients in his office.  Then he told me about the Wheat Belly book. \\"Many patients complain about their weight but seldom do they completely follow my council,\\" he said, \\"But once you understand 'the WHY' you can handle 'the HOW.'\\"  I went straight to the bookstore and bought both books--Wheat Belly and the Wheat Belly Cookbook.  From the first chapters I knew I could handle this concept of eating--eliminating the wheat and other gluten is an imperative for me.  My wife and I threw out all the whole grain cereals and processed foods and breads and pasta.  Today, my blood work numbers all center on normal and my wound has healed. I have lost over 30 lbs. in 7 weeks.  I have not exercised at all.  I don't experience the usual insane carb cravings as with \\"white knuckle diets.\\"  I did experience modest \\"carbohydrate withdrawals\\" the first three days--laughable compared to such great benefits.<br />  Do yourself a favor and get both books.  The recipes in each book are different and delightful.  If you still have relatively good health thank God, and think about this;  the cost of these two hardbound books are less than a Rx of insulin for the rest of your life.  If you're taking medications you would be prudent to check with your doctor before stopping any medications even though you experience much improved health by eliminating wheat gluten from your diet.  Finally, I add this joyous note; my vanity quotient is going up because my wife approves of my better health and slimmer appearance even though I am wearing again that same old blue suit.

B006VFLIYK|3.0|If you are a David Baldacci fan, there will be nothing in this book to disappoint you. If you are not a Baldacci fan, there is nothing here to tempt you to become one.<br />This is typical Baldacci--lots of action, shortage of personal involvement, big masculine presence, women as stage dressing. The writer stays with his strengths; he seems to have a good handle on the ins and outs of such agencies as the FBI, he knows his firearms, and he can set up an action sequence better, perhaps, than anyone.<br />So, if that's what you like, go for this book. If you've ever read one of this author's books, you'll know what to expect. And why should he change? The formula has made him a best-selling author.

0765325950|5.0|Was completely taken aback, compelled and riveted by this entire series- my soul drips with admiration and gratitude.  Beautiful story, spiritually complex and utterly moving- unity of light with dark, freedom of pure will to choose a good life, power of love and heart's direction to undo soul-effacing separations from Source.  Bravo!  Amazing book, incredible read.  Powerful story, with characters and story arcs that moved me to tears.  Thanks Jordan & Sanderson!

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have a two year old son and this case is very helpful in keeping the Kindle safe and sound.  The &#34;stand&#34; feature of the case helps a lot also because he can watch his shows or games and sit back and relax.
B002HMHROQ|5.0|It's common knowledge now some 30 years later that The Blue Mask is regarded as Lou Reed's return to form which it is.<br /><br />First off, gone are the experiments with horns, keyboards, symphonic backing (half of Berlin, title track of Street Hassle) and in their place is an actual rock band with the same musical make up of The Velvet Undreground (Two guitars, Bass, Drums). This is the setting Reed thrived in during his beginnings and he does so on this album.<br /><br />Second, the songwriting is on par with his earliest solo outings. Reed's songs tended to tell mostly stories about other people in the 70's. This album includes some autobiographical material. \\"My House\\" which is a nice tribute to poet Delmore Schwartz ([[ASIN:0811220036 In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories (New Directions Paperbook)]]) Average Guy, Heavenly Arms, Day John Kennedy Died, Women, Undrerneath the Bottle,are all personal aurobiographical type songs. The Gun, Heroine, Waves of Fear tell stories. This is a departure from what Reed did before. I think only Kill Your Sons on Sally Can't Dance went this far in personal storytelling.<br /><br />Reed crafted a sort of trilogy of albums. The Blue Mask, [[ASIN:B001BIMXCS Legendary Hearts]], [[ASIN:B0013AZNNU New Sensations]]. I believe all three have the same band behind him and the songwriting, and playing on all three are equally as strong.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B004VFN72S|5.0|Copycat is a well crafted thriller with two very different women characters....both very strong in their own way. Together they bring out the best in one another!

0060555661|5.0|Thinking about learning to invest? You will need this book, don't just merely trade stocks and bonds learn how people really get rich, over a lifetime of prudent cost averaging investing in reputable dividend stocks. I thought I could just borrow this book from the library but so many people wanted it and it has such a wealth of information I had to get my own copy to keep!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Awesome! Totally toates magoats like omg gurl this game is fabulous!!! Lol I tricky at first but fun! Very time consuming though
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has beautiful, if spooky, graphics. I loved just looking at the screen. The hints are well placed - helpful but not obvious. The creators are very talented and imaginative. I  was able to finish the whole game in a few hours. This game would not work for filling a few spare minutes - better for longer periods of time.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game has great graphics. The music is soothing. It keeps you interested with new quests and the fun storyline. Even better that it's free!
B009T8XBBO|4.0|This game is mostly about how quickly your fingers move. You have to keep your eye on about 3 things at once. I had played it successfully for numerous levels, then hit one where I can't seem to beat the clock and then I lost interest. The graphics are well done, if rather small.
0920668372|5.0|I have read this book to all three of my children since they were babies! I still get all misty eyed and choked up! This book will remain in my top favorites always!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game has an extremely simple premise. You can play for a few minutes or longer. I don't like that it wants you to pay for hints.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is great, except the last update prevented me from getting on the app. All else is really awesome!
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|Satriani mixes his old style with a jazzier beat.  This album is a great addition to his other solo work.  Which is most of his career.

B00466HM28|4.0|I gave MPK Mini 4 of 5 only for the fact that it is fairly light weight, and feels somewhat like a toy. To some degree, you get what you pay for, and if you drop the extra $150 you can get an APC 40. But for about $100, this is a great piece of equipment that has a ton of uses. I have used it with both Traktor and Ableton, with great success. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get into digital music production or performance on a budget. I purchased this item in college about 3 years ago, have used it consistently, and have had 0 problems with it. The buttons fire like they did when I first got it. Fantastic value in this!
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Would hope this series never ends its such a great show and cast couldn't have been any better I give it an A

1481130331|5.0|Christoph Fischer has written an important historical rendition of wartime Eastern Europe that will continue to haunt you for a long time after you finish reading it. The Luck of the Weissensteiners presents the spirit and horrific social conditions of Bratislava and the neighbouring countries during the Holocaust. The actual political figures of that era are embedded in the story but the slew of other characters are all strong fictional creations that give life and credibility to the historical backdrop.<br />It is a touching story of courage, love and heroic endurance in a time of abject cruelty and terror. War has the knack of bringing out either the best or the worse of the human psyche--both extremes are equally depicted in the novel.<br />The players in this drama are far from being two-dimensional; even the cold, unfeeling characters will at times show a glimmer of warmth. Greta and her Jewish family remain loyal to their compassionate and trusting nature throughout their terrifying ordeal. Her fate is sealed when she falls in love with Wilhelm, a charming German bookseller whose true colours as a calculating anti-Semite are revealed when the going gets tough.<br />Be prepared for emotional upheaval while reading this-- you cannot remain untouched.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The 3rd and final chapter of the Hunger Games trilogy is fast-moving and action-packed.  It provides the depth and meaning to much of what had gone before.  It also gives closure to a the reader.  Loved it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I've only had this app for a short time but I enjoy it a lot.  Might give it 5 stars after playing it longer.
0316223239|5.0|One of my favorite novels! What an incredible accomplishment to write a book from the point of view of a young child without compromising the adult realities he innocently describes, or playing to the cute. Despite the gruesome situation, this story is really about the extraordinary love between a mother and her little boy. I could not put it down. It's heart-wrenching, moving and surprisingly uplifting.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|No matter your preferred genre, this is a great artist! I was most impressed at GPA's ability to reach beyond the expected and give the reader a whole new level of the reading experience. I believe this author has a lot more to share, but above that, he has the ability to teach. The message that I heard through his poetry is be true to you. This is no ordinary poetry. He puts on a concert with the marriage of his words. And his concert provokes the reader to scream, Encore!
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|If you like twilight I think you will love this. It has potential to be even better. It gives you an insight on both aliens and the humans as they are trying to live and survive. There is some great acting in this movie.
B004FV1ESW|5.0|I loves this movie, Ben Affleck needed to start directing movies years ago, he clearly has a knack for it.
1781162646|5.0|Great story, Fantastic Characters, Satisfying end. The ususal high quality product from Stephen King. Great summer read, but I'm sure I'll be reading it again soon.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Simply said, this is the most wide eyed, jaw hanging down, horror film I have EVER seen. I love the original Evil Dead film, but this is a film unto it's self, and should not be compared to the original. If you can let yourself watch this without Bruce C in mind and you do not need comic relief, you will be VERY impressed. The actors are great and the visuals are way too realistic. It took me 2 nights to get through this film. Not because I was bored or the film slowed down, but because I needed to breathe. It really sets a new \\"bar\\" for all horror to follow. I rented this on RB but will definitely be purchasing. I can't even imagine will be on the unrated release that is sure to follow.

B001TH44VY|1.0|Amadeus tries to demonstrate the idea that you can destroy a man's career, but you can't stop his divine talent from being unleashed onto the world.<br /><br />The movie tries to show this with three external plots: the plot to destroy Mozart's career by Salieri, the plot of Mozart's fame and the plot of Salieri's fame (where fame roughly represents their musical reputation). Salieri succeeds in destroying Mozart's career by killing him. Mozart's fame endures as his divine creations are valued by posterity. Salieri's fame on the other hand, fades as his musical works are largely forgotten.<br /><br />The movie starts out with Salieri as an old man recollecting about his triumph over Mozart. By this point, the world has forgotten him and only remember's Mozart's music. From there on, the movie goes on to show us Salieri destroying Mozart's career.<br /><br />The movie was a waste of time because from the first scene on, we are told what will happen: that Salieri's jealousy destroys Mozart's career but not his everlasting fame. Then the movie goes on to show us just that, with no surprises of any kind. The portrayal of the main plot of Salieri destroying Mozart is thus predictably episodic. And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end. All we are left with is a 3 hour sap story and way too many scenes of random operas. If we wanted to appreciate Mozart's talent, time is better spent just listening to his music or watching an opera instead of sitting through this picture slideshow.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Cute game but not for young children or beginners.<br /><br />There is no difficulty setting so young children and inexperienced game players will find this one frustratingly difficult. Inexperienced players will die in about 20 seconds and are then presented with the opportunity to buy a restart with earned or purchased coins. The problem is that inexperienced players rarely get the opportunity to earn coins and must purchase them for real money if they wish to continue. Don't want to spend real bucks? Then it's back to the beginning and waiting for the game to reload for you! That gets old really fast.<br /><br />Additionally, the game continuously presents the player with the opportunity for in-game purchases. Had I not turned off the in-game purchases, I'm sure my son would have made many of them. And they're not cheap at up to $50 each. . I can see this quickly becoming an expense of hundreds of dollars in the hands of a 4 or 5 year old. The game seems to be more focused on making money for the developers than on fun for the player. Were this not a hit movie, it would not be on my son's tablet right now. It's coming off as soon as the novelty runs out.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Title says it all. I read a negative review that said you need to purchase items in game to succeed. That is simply not true there are a few items available but the only reason you would &quot;need&quot; to purchase them is if you had zero problem solving skills. If you are looking for a great game this is it.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Sophie Kinsella always makes me feel better when I am down.  She makes me laugh, cry and feel better about my own life.  And, occasionally I learn something along the way.  I have never been disappointed and I hope you enjoy her work as much as I do.<br /><br />Best

B0058SNI58|4.0|These shoes are perfectly fine.  Not amazing (they slide around a little too much for my liking and I feel like I'm about to walk out of them sometimes, and they also give me pretty bad blisters if I wear them without socks all day), but not horrible either.  For the price, they are solidly decent.
140006922X|1.0|It is quite easy to take the path this author did....following his limited experience and perceptions, rather than seeking to understand the truth.  Did he ever study out the apparent contradictions of the Bible he refers to?  I doubt it, because if he had, he would not be reaching this terrible conclusion.  For instance - a well known \\"contradiction\\" right at the first of the Bible, between Genesis 1 and 2 - which makes it sound as if the order of creation in chapter 1 does not correspond to the order of creation in chapter 2.  (ie Which came first, plants or man?)  But if you look at the language and context of the two chapters, you easily understand that Genesis 1 - 2:1-4 is the order of creation overall, while 2:5-24 is the order of the sixth day from Adam's perspective.  In Chapter 1, all vegetation of the earth was created on day 3 while man was created on day 6.  In chapter 2, before there was any bush of the field or small plants (to be cultivated), God made man, THEN planted the garden in Eden.  So vegetation day 3, man day 6.....but on day 6 man was created, then the garden and the work he was commissioned to do.  No contradiction there, though scholars have argued this for centuries.  Obviously Reza Aslan didn't have sufficient courage of his convictions to search and stand by the truth.  Those who genuinely know Christ would never take this ridiculous path, because we understand both His love and resurrection power.  Poor Raza only understands the limits of mental ascension, and therefore fell away from the God he never really knew. He is a double minded man who will lead his readers into a ditch if they are foolish enough to follow.  Amended: 8/2/2013  This says it all:  [...]
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game!<br />would suggest to anyone. classic game for those looking to pass some time while working. lol! or anywhere.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This author should be commended for a very thought provoking creation. While this is not historical it could have happened in this manner. The intertwining of human emotions with a wartime setting and the backdrop of the largest tactical deception ever conceived and executed, resulted in a very enjoyable read.
B0055S348W|4.0|This allowed me to connect with our printer printer and print out anything I need to from my Kindle Fire. One of the best free apps I've ever downloaded!

B00CWY76CC|3.0|it is fun and challenging,  just not very many levels. that is the only bad thing about it. but hey, it is free. hopefully more come soon.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I've been sucked in, good writing, good character development, and lets face Harvey certainly ain't hard on the eyes. So glad I stumbled on this show.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all 3 books!  Very well written.  Can't wait for the movie to come out.  Hope to read more of her books.
0770437400|4.0|I liked the format of this book. It is set up as a series of interviews of survivors. It approaches ideas about a collapse of society that some other apocalyptic books do not. Be aware that the book is not like the movie. The zombies here are slow and somewhat dumb.  A good summer zombie apocalypse read.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|I have tried to install the app on Galaxy s4  but it crashes every time i try to open it.
0062255657|4.0|I liked this short novel. I read it very quickly. Being a fan of magic and the possibility of things outside our understanding of the world, I have to say that this book was worth buying. It was quite well done.
B005R4KUZE|5.0|Please see my more detailed review of the free version of this game with ads. You can just click on see all my reviews. and you will get my mind set view of this game in detail. The game has three levels with normal, advanced and master. They are average, very good player and above that the previous level to play in tournaments with noteworthy respect. The game's ad free version is offerdd here, and I gave it a step above rating based on add bias. I do realize that the ads help pay for the app in the first place and enable the creator the chance to present the game to a distributor like Amazon. I guess it depends on where the ads are located, and if they distract from the game in most situations. I like a squelch setting so the user or buyer of this game has freedom of sight of distractions. I like both games for offering a practice of the mind set of more than 1200 puzzles, and they are the same in both games. It is helpful in learning how to think which move would be the most of leaving the piece protected or out of attack square and putting the king in check to eventually checkmate. The \\"Analyze This App\\" offers more in an app to compliment these games in discussing the move possiblities, and why they might be a better choice to make. Of course variation does leave interpretation open in the road can be traveled in more than one way. The outcome can still be obtained as long as the wisdom of the move is solid. (a well thought out conclusion to win by checkmate for the player)
0399215921|1.0|I had thought this would be a standard size board book. It is actually really small (like the size of your hand) with tiny pictures that are printed on regular paper. It is more appropriate to fit into your purse for reading on an airplane or something instead of day to day rocking chair time. Disappointed.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Every Tegan and Sara album has its own sound, each managing to keep the essence of Tegan and Sara themselves and have a common thread. Heartthrob is no exception, giving listeners insight into the minds and lives of the girls with an all new, refreshing pop sound. This is an album I could hear on the radio - and I have. Even mainstream pop music has finally  noticed these girls, and their new success is well-deserved. Heartthrob has a catchy, '80s reminiscent sound to it that's undeniably hooky. In thirty years you'll still remember these songs just like people remember Paula Abdul and Toni Basil today. This album is the most advanced and professional album Tegan and Sara have put out yet, especially vocally. Big powerhouse ballads like I Was a Fool and Now I'm All Messed Up are very vocally impressive. The girls' voices just get better and better. Get Heartthrob and get Tegan and Sara's six previous albums as well. They're all great.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book won the Man Booker Prize. (Upcoming movie!)<br />I loved this book because of things that aren't apparent until you're about half way through. It's the story of a young son of a zookeeper who becomes shipwrecked and left to die. His only chance at survival is to tame his one passenger--a Bengal tiger. There is so much to love about this book that I don't want to spoil the story, but I do want to share a part of the writer's point. It's all about the story. Good or bad, it's all about what we believe. Like a magician, this writer made me want to ride the waves in his lifeboat. Since there's more to a story than meets the eye, every writer should read this novel!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game but on my kindle it looks so small.... oh well. It's still really fun to play.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Miss Gilbert took off for a year to explore Italy, India and Bali on her own terms so she could write the quintessential memoir from her personal, humorous perspective. I enjoyed this book --listening to her write about God's transcendence, and how she went to Italy to feed her body and then she went to India to feed her soul and Bali to feed her heart--something still makes me think she seeks even more contentment and fulfillment to nourish her completely, giving her the strength and curiosity needed for three new countries, thus a sequel.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The cast keeps performing at a high level in the sequel to this beautiful story about casts and classes in the Old England.<br />Downton Abbey maintains its close fight with &#34;Upstairs & Downstairs&#34; as &#34;epoque&#34; describing best series, in my opinion.<br />Nice show to spend a placid Sunday afternoon.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Super penguins is the best temple run themed app ever made, but has the light hearted feel of Subway Surfers. The graphics are cute and the music is like a techno dream. It is great for calming down a bit, kids who are bored to death, and even elderly people. I am a teen and am loving this game! So get this app, it is free and worth your time.

B002GHHHH4|5.0|A truly great summer film- I watched it while in  June.  I was sheerly appauled(possible book title?) that anyone would give this fun action packed masterpiece a bad review.  I watched this with my best friend Jays son and he loved it even more then I did.  When Stallone beat that other guy at arm wrestling I was speechless and found it hard to even form words ....I stood up and began trying to say \\" oh man he used the fist!\\"  but all I could muster was........ \\"Man!\\"  then \\"Zooks\\"  then \\"Kiss my ass Jay's Son!\\"  oh boy did we laugh at that little flub- thanks Over the top for creating real life moments like that.  How did sequels of this NOT get made?
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was riveting.  I thought it would just be for my teenage daughter but once I started reading I really enjoyed it.  DOWN WITH THE CAPITOL.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|If you have seem the musical you will be disappointed. Don't not watch.  They even ruined the last scene by changing the singers. It was also too graphic for no reason.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Just a lovely book that I would highly recommend to anyone who loves a slightly offbeat, quirky story.<br /><br />The author writes about the challenges faced by Professor Don Tillman when he meets Rosie - two people who are polar extremes in their approach to life.<br /><br />Don probably has Asperger's but does not recognise it as such. He only knows that he is \\"different\\". He has the \\"standardised meal system\\", \\"costumes\\" to clean the bathroom and time efficiency down to a tee. And although his schedule keeps him feeling in control and allows him to operate in the world he wishes he had more................he wishes he had company, friendship and a WIFE.<br /><br />Along comes Rosie - totally, totally unsuitable (in Don's eyes). She turns his world upside down, and in doing so causes Don to question himself and reassess his approach to life.<br /><br />Graeme Simsion writes with much endearment, humour and warmth. His quirky style allows us to empathise with Don, and perhaps even provides an insight into Asperger's. If it achieves this then such inroads have been made. Overall a delightful, feel good book !! Five out of five !!
0375507256|5.0|Avoid the movie at all costs or at least til you have finished this book and want some laughs. I read this book and immediately turned to page one and started reading again. Work of art.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Not really a fan of Kristen Stewart but I enjoy these types of movies, usually. This one however lacked any real storyline that was worth following and the action was cheap at best. Definatley not the Snow White stories I grew up with.

B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Hope they make more of these.  There have always been rumors of them making more of these.  The ratings were high, wish they didn't stop making this.
B001KX50BK|5.0|Great movie! I love the clarity of the picture and I have no complaints about anything. If you are a fan of this movie and would like to own it so you can watch it anytime, then this is definitely for you!
B000HL2J0G|4.0|Non-violent show that makes you think how he is going to get out of the current scenario.  I had never seen MacGyver before.  I like it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this app! She loves horses, and this game is way better than other cartoonish games out there. I'm glad I made this purchase.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was good but my expectations were higher after the reviews I read.  However I do not regret reading it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I feel like I was a year behind my friends reading this book, but I'm soooo glad I read it. It kept me interested the whole time - staying up late and getting up early to finish it. It just kept getting better. Great characters, good plot, surprising twists. This book had everything.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I love the show Dexter but could do without the potty mouth of his sister on the show.  Sheesh that is so unnecessary Hollyweird!!  Dexter sure knows how to get the &#34;bag guy&#34; or &#34;girl&#34; and give them their comeuppance.  Love the series but of course murder is NEVER right.  Just saying.
B00C2U6G7C|4.0|Man of Steel is a good Soundtrack but not iconic as Superman The Movie and the John Williams score. I like the soundtrack and Hans Zimmer's work and their are some tracks I enjoy like Flight ,  What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World? which has the Man of Steel theme in the track ,  and also Arcade is a good track on the soundtrack. My little con of the soundtrack though it is not as iconic as the John Williams Superman The Movie score which had many great pieces of music. And true Man of Steel is  a different  Superman film than the other Superman films. Han Zimmer's Man of Steel score is good not saying it is not but it could be better. Overalll I liked the Man of Steel Soundtrack.
1451678193|5.0|It's a great novel, written by a great man. The story line is great. This novel makes not want to stop reading.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|I really like this show and its because its clever and filled with dark humor. While the show has started to stagnate a bit this season picked things up from the previous. I particularly enjoyed the later episodes in the season when the action really picks up.<br /><br />This season is probably the 2nd or 3rd best season overall in Dexter and really makes the show exciting again. If you are a fan of the show you have to get this season seven set. It's must see Dexter.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'm not usually a reader of books full of serious life problems that don't miraculously disappear into a happy ending. I had a friend recommended this book and am so glad I read it. The characters are easy to love yet flawed. And the honesty of the inner dialogue is both refreshing and terrifying. I really enjoyed this book and I have a feeling that I'll like it more as I reflect on it.
0061537969|5.0|Get the Kleenex out and put away your pride! Dog lover or not, this book conjures up many human emotions, cleanses the tear ducts and refills the soul. This Seattle story is told from the unique perspective of Enzo, the dog. It reinforces all those humanoid projections we place on our pets and is 100% effective in delivering the heart of the book. The author reportedly drew from three buckets of inspiration: a documentary film called \\"State of Dogs\\" about the Mongolian belief that the next incarnation for a dog will be a man; the poem, The Revenant by B. Collins, about a euthanized dog who reminisced about his dislike for his master and the last element, the part about racing, derived from a friends personal trials and interest in racing. The author's website is informative and even has recipes (charred broccoli!), Enzo fan paraphernalia etc. Check it out here. The story is not all tears though. There is a particularly vivid but dark scene yet in hindsight humorous involving hallucinations and zebras.... \\"Somewhere the zebra is dancing\\". That is the hook....<br /><br />But beyond a great read about the tough decisions, staying the course, doing the right thing and all the subsequent cascades of said decisions, it is brimming with nuggets of wisdom in the form of notable quotables.<br /><br />There is at least one for every situation or moment you may be swirling in. Check out my blog review for my favorites at [...]

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I've never read a weight loss book that wasn't afraid to look at obesity through a lens of 150 years. Most are only focused on brand new discoveries or repackaged discoveries. I would recommend this to people that like science and logic rather than an emotional shiny object to weight loss. It's probably the best book to respond to the critics of following a low carb diet because the author responds to it with scientific journals and examples throughout recent history and amongst different cultures.
B006QS1XRO|3.0|I enjoyed it but more like a tasty morsel than a full meal.  I appreciated the nuances of the characters - there were genuinely times when it surprised me.  I wish Hassan had faced some more adversity or challenges later in the book.  Maybe some more dirt on Parisian restaurant politics.  Wasn't too sure the purpose of the protest-turned-bad action.  But I finished it which is a compliment for someone as picky as I am.
B00BIXZBP2|5.0|I highly recommend this product. Three Friends is a unique concept album chronicling the lives of three male friends who meet at school and then drift off  to the world of work. Gentle Giant's musicianship is extraordinary. Changing in dynamics from subtle harmonized vocals to blistering guitar riffs. The songs School Days and Peel the Paint have w nimble and unexpected changes. All the songs have multiple meanings and complex musical paths. Octopus is a good prog rock album  and contains many of the musical traits found in Three Friends. Still , there is nothing like Three Friends to be found anywhere. I was 12 when it came out and heard it at a friends house who's college age sister owned it. I eventually bought a copy years later and I own a thousand or so albums of all kinds of music rock, folk rock, alternative , grunge, jazz, jazz fusion, prog rock,classical. Three Friends still is a fascination to me. My life is chronicled by the story of the record. I be came an artist and my friend who's sister had the album became a carpenter. Our lives drifted apart like so many people's do especially when one builds things that have a function and gets paid for it and one creates for beauty and seldom sells.  Three Friends does not only chronicles my life it transcends the specific and speaks about any three school chums who drift apart.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved this book, but really hated the the ending. It had a good thing going until the ending. It kept me hooked!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun as I said, me and my sister can't get off it! Basic idea but masses of fun. Lots of wacky upgrades and out outfits. I personally think it should be a priced app. For any despicable me fans, this is nothing to miss. If you don't think this app is for you just give it a go! After all,it is free.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this app.
B0051GOB26|1.0|So I received this movie in a good time frame but the Digital Copy was almost a year out of date. Thank you so much for posting that it has it digital copy then have it be out of date. Maybe you should check your stock before you post things, or at least update your post. I wouldn't buy this copy there are better ones on Amazon. I'm still really disappoint!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Every one was very good except for the brace. I don't want to write a story. Thank you very much. Okay
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Loved Discovery of Witches.<br />It was beyond brilliant & extremely well written.<br />I hope to read more from Deborah Harkness in the future.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is definitely entertaining and deserves to be called \\"Chef\\".  I was drawn to his book after watching several episodes of his culinary adventures on television. Be prepared for forthright roiling honesty in this pot-full of struggles. I enjoyed learning about the underbelly culture of kitchens and the truly unique people who make a restaurant meal happen. Anthony holds nothing back in his own personal history with drugs and alcohol. He throws the door open to the antics of anyone and everyone from wait staff to garbage handlers. Be prepared to be immersed in remarkable food preparations from soup to sex...yeah, it's in there with the garnish. You can't help dropping your jaw at the shennanigans of who has the money and fresh fish. I was inspired and compelled to order two of his knife recommendations and throw out the unnecessary ones.  You will read Kitchen Confidential for the thrill of Anthony's revelations on his quest to become Chef...be awed and laugh, too.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|I thought this was going to be a sleeper movie. I was wrong.  I liked it very much.  Worth the price to rent and watch it.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The minion are my favorite characters of the whole movie.  They remind me of my friends when we all get together. A very funny and entertaining movie.  Can't wait until the next movie can be rented.  Looking forward to it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This ebook was just what I needed to take me step by step through the process for converting my book to an ebook.  It took the anxiety out of all the little details I wasn't sure about while reading other resources.  It is simple and easy to read, while covering the essential little questions I had that I really was hoping to find answers for.
B00CXQL828|5.0|The rest of the album is stellar, as others have said.  Like many people, I was anxiously awaiting the song entitled Time Machine.  Wow!  As with the rest of this album, no other combination of people could have developed that song, and pulled off the performance.  To me it's worth the album price alone.
B008645YH6|5.0|I absolutely love her. This album is a must. I noticed this album has a little more of a techno Electra heart feel to it. I love it!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book more than watching the movie. The details were much more vivid than the movie. I don't want to compare the book to the movie so much because the movie is good too.<br />The book was exciting. It was intense. It was real. The only part that could have used some work was the end. It just didn't go far enough as I think it should have. But I guess that leads me to want to read the next one.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|A fellow photog bought this camera backpack and the price was great so I ordered it. It is nice and big but not too big. My only problem with it is it's a bit whimpy. I'm used to a very sturdy camera bag. I like how big this bag is but I don't think it's going to last a long time...may be surprised...but at this price you can replace them and not be out a bunch of money.

1781162646|4.0|Stephen King has created another page turning treat.  The story was much lighter than some of his previous books, but I enjoyed growing up in the 70's and felt as if I have traveled back in time of carnival rides and cotton candy with a flare of drama. Thank you for the memories and thrill. Great read to keep in purse or pocket.

I understand that movies cant go into the detail books do but wow, really?  If you've read the book then you understand the locket. if you haven't read the book then it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. instead of the locket visions you could just leave it at the story of how it all started. there were so many good parts left out of the movie and so many weird ones in it. and the ending? I had this perfect scene set in my mind when I read it. he looks at her and realizes that she has one green eye and one gold...that's good stuff there. this one? come on. disappointed. hoped for more.

B000063DI9|5.0|Iron Maiden's seventh full-length effort, \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son,\\" is one of the most overlooked and/or underrated installments in the band's discography. It is a traditional heavy metal album with some strong progressive metal, power metal, and speed metal overtones. This 1988 recording is also the sound of a musical group that is firing on all cylinders, as they churn out some not only very impressive and infectious instrumental chops, here, but some first-rate songwriting, as well. (With its heavily progressive song structuring and playing times -- it includes some tunes that clock in well past the five minute mark -- \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\" seems like the perfect lead-in to the epic approach taken on later Maiden efforts like 2000's \\"Brave New World.\\") In the end, Iron Maiden are easily one of the most influential things ever to happen to heavy metal music, and it is with albums like this one that they prove that fact to be true.<br /><br />The album begins with the sound of some jangly acoustic guitars. But that is before \\"Moonchild\\" becomes a near Judas Priest-worthy speed metaller with soaring harmonic choruses, noteworthy (and very technical) bass work, and a mazy, winding guitar solo section. And \\"Infinite Dreams\\" completes the album's opening one-two punch, working in a likewise fashion to the aforementioned \\"Moonchild,\\" as it begins with lovely twin-guitar harmonies that make the song start out sounding like a power ballad. But it does inevitably soon pick up massive amounts of speed and momentum, through the use of some ultra-belligerent guitar work and a muscular, pulsating bass throb. And this is then followed-up by \\"Can I Play With Madness,\\" which just might be the heaviest song on the album, as it is a piece of pure, propulsive speed metal driven by brisk riffing and irresistible, instantly memorable, and positively anthemic choruses. But the subsequent \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" gives this track a run for its money in the heaviness department, as it features deftly fast, grumbling bass lines, some surprisingly hefty double bass drumming, and a screaming, piercing, shredding guitar solo.<br /><br />And highlights on \\"Seventh\\"'s second half are not few and/or far between, either. The title track, in fact, takes the cake for being the record's biggest highpoint, as it is a nearly ten-minute long epic that features a rhythmically marching beat, and soaring, infectiously catchy choruses. And it also has an ominously slow breakdown near its end where some choral/symphonic music-sounding, clean backing vocals sift their way onto the scene, as does a blistering, trade-off solo section. And \\"The Prophecy\\" is another standout, as it has some superb melodic guitar work (including a fantastic bout of screaming, piercing soloing, and a lovely string arrangement in its outro) coursing throughout. And the record's closing one-two punch is also of note: \\"The Clairvoyant\\" and \\"Only The Good Die Young\\" both begin with noteworthy bass intros before rocketing the listener into pure speed metal territory complete with fiery, crunchy riffing and some great, melodic, shred-tastic soloing that should have Yngwie Malmsteen (et al) nodding and grinning in approval.<br /><br />As if you didn't already know, \\"Seventh Son\\" is further proof of the fact that Iron Maiden know more cool things than you could ever even think about shaking a wizard's stick at. They know when to attack and thrash, yet also know when to restrain themselves by settling into a nice little groove, and sometimes even venture off into more progressive, involved and keyboard-driven territory, thus helping their musical arrangements to breathe significantly. Furthermore, I.M. make each riff count, and are also not stranger to dazzling (and technically-proficient) guitar leads, and solos that are truly amazing. As a result, \\"Seventh\\" is a true standout in the band's discography, and definitely an album that all metalheads should make a part of their collection.After all, it might not usurp \\"The Number Of The Beast\\" (1982)  and/or \\"Powerslave\\" (1984) in terms of excellence, but it is still a pretty darn great album!After all, it might not usurp \\"The Number Of The Beast\\" (1982)  and/or \\"Powerslave\\" (1984) in terms of excellence, but it is still a pretty darn great album!
B002PNER9U|4.0|I've never seen the live show, but I've seen the movie a couple of times. It's a poignant and funny story about bohemian love and loss. The cast is phenomenal and I absolutely adore the blocking and dancing - visually, it hits you as hard as the music. Really well done.
B000AP04OM|1.0|Unfortunately, this 2-disk package was a gift and the recipient could not run it.  Not only did it stop, but it was noticed it had a gash on the disk.  Amazon made it right and ordered it from another vendor.  I wonder why the quality control on these items wasn't better.  In any case all's well that ends well and The Sound of Music was provided by a different vendor.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|Oblivion is an entertaining movie with a measure of freshness. No aspects were obviously lacking, though some questions the audience may have (less pressing, I suppose) do go unanswered, though the biggest plot points obtain resolution. It's a film that focuses primarily on its main character, Jack (Tom Cruise), despite the enormity of its reach, and so, for a sci-fi movie, it felt a little unsatisfying. Still, my attention was happily kept for the duration.

B009KG7EMC|5.0|I choose this rating for the action, There is also a story , in this movie . about the hardships of war,
B004EAQNO4|5.0|It seemed like it was going to be a &#34;bottle episode&#34; type movie, but the story extended beyond the reach of the proverbially damned elevator. It's an engaging character and humanity study through the lens of Judeo-Christianity that's still accessible for those of us who are tired of that preachy and pervasive lens. Sin, forgiveness, and downright terror - it's all there. The acting and cinematography was surprisingly well done for a film that could easily have fallen into conventional horror tropes. I was amazed at how viscerally attached I was to the characters going into the film with the knowledge that there would be blood. It's mildly twisty, for sure, but with or without the twistiness of the twists, it's an entertaining and fascinating film.
B00845MRKE|5.0|Ridley Scott's cutting edge masterpiece, is still one of the all time great science fiction films! A true 80's classic.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I can say that as a medical professional, the book was interesting, but I was disappointed in the book. I wish that Dr. Alexander had gone more into detail concerning things that Om had told him. I know my God loves me. That was what I took from his book.
B009WUBERW|5.0|What else can you say about it? It's like saying 'water is wet' or the sky is blue. I liked it, though you have to figure out how he gets being on ground to being in airplane so fast, or how they 'picked up Billy' there in the beginning of the film. It's rife with one-liners (\\"I'll be BACK\\" or \\"I'm BAAAACK\\"), but I have to say, I liked the \\"Yippe Ki-ay\\" line from Willis. The body count is only exceeded by the ammunition in each weapon, in typical Stallone style, the bad guy(s) get dispatched in unique manners. Two Thumbs Up. Men, if you've been forced to sit thru a chick flick or two, THIS is the atonement flick your significant other MUST see to make it up to you for girly-fying your emotions. You almost want  Stallone to kiss the girl in the end, but alas, it doesn't happen.<br /><br />Oh well. 3 will be out soon.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Apple app is very fun,entertaining and very nice for a child to play even I enjoy it hope you like my review
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|This movie is a reasonable action movie and if you like high speed chases, crashing cars, vicious escaped criminals then you will like this movie.  There is not much of a plot and what plot there is in this film is really silly.  Just put that out of your mind and watch Arnold do his thing the way he does it.  I am an Arnold fan so for me it was fun to watch the old man in action.<br /><br />I won't go into the movie and put in any spoilers but just don't expect a grade A film.  This is more of a grade C action movie and Arnold raises the level to a grade B.  Sit back and enjoy it and be entertained.  It is worth viewing once.<br /><br />I rated it as a 4 star film for entertainment only and featuring a legend in action films as the main star.

B007VDN1PA|4.0|Most of the expensive slide scanners are not much better than this until you reach the pro level at over 1000 dollars. The beauty of this unit is speed. My previous Nikon scanner did work better, but it took about six minutes per slide to preview, scan and process. With this, I can scan a slide in under a minute, including the time to pick it up, insert, scan and remove.<br /><br />For casual viewing, this little guy works very well. It does overexpose a bit, but you can manually program it down one half a stop, then the image looks much better. Illumination is even across the entire image with no vignetting in the corners. Most other units I've seen in this price range have hot spots in the center of the image. This doesn't. Image sharpness is about average, even on well focused slides. But the thing is only 80 bucks., so you can't really expect the same performance as a thousand dollar unit. Negatives look about the same, and if you are careful not to push the end of the film strip into the wall at the other end of the device, you can get a better image quality by not using the plastic film adapter. Just ease the strip into the exit slot so you don't crease it.<br /><br />For the money and ease of use, I think this unit is the best bang for the buck, even if it doesn't measure up to the quality of a pro unit like my Nikon.

1419705644|5.0|If you are looking for a book with lots of specific information about the making of Adventure Time, this is not that book. I see another reader has criticized The Adventure Time Encyclopedia for not providing behind-the-scenes trivia, show history, or interviews with the cast and creators.<br /><br />While that may be a disappointment for certain AT fans, I have a very different response as a fan both of the show and of author Martin Olson, best known for  the instant cult classic \\"Encyclopaedia of Hell\\" (and as the voice of Hunson Abadeer, a character seemingly reflective of Olson's cult celebrity as the evil-oid EOH author).<br /><br />Rather than a research-based tell-all about Adventure Time, this book is something which could only have been written by Olson.<br /><br />With so much AT information already available on the Wikia site, blogs, features and interviews on youtube, etc., it seems Pendleton Ward and company wanted to take this book to another level.  So, instead of hiring someone to gather data and conduct interviews, they got Olson to bring his unique imagination and warped sense of humor to \\"The Adventure Time Encyclopedia,\\" creating something truly original though difficult to categorize.<br /><br />Isn't that just like them?<br /><br />Equal parts fanporn, comedy, and bizarre experiment in meta-literature, Encyclopaedia of Adventure Time is for those who seek more than just a typical \\"Making Of\\" book. So, for Glob's sake, curl up with a nice cup of mallow tea and vibe into the extreme algebraicism of this utterly strange book. Of which, some parts seem to be alive. Or are a fanzine scribbled insanely by the Ice King. And all of which is hilariously littered with handwritten notes by Finn, Jake and Marceline (Also: Artwork. Beautiful, detailed, artwork by Tony Millionaire and Mahendra Singh. Please).<br /><br />Even knowing Olson's previous work, TATE is not what I was expecting.  Which is totally rhombus.

B004NS710C|5.0|This movie was really good!  It was full of action and excitement, and it is based on a true story.  I often found myself holding my breath because in suspense!  And of course, Denzel Washington and Chris Pine are amazing actors!  I don't remember anything about this movie when it came out in 2010, and am glad I heard about it.  Highly recommend if you enjoy action adventure movies.

1400097029|4.0|This novel of an elderly man's ruminations on a seminal event in his life is of interest for the prose and the author's expert use of language. It is a novel that you read for ideas, impressions, and recognition of human behavior. The author's sentences are a joy to read -- for perhaps the first time, I thought that this might be a book best enjoyed via audiobook.<br /><br />But the book is definitely something you don't read for plot. As with most fiction, the plot is silly and so unbelievable that you can't help but laugh. The protagonist, Max Morden, spent summers at the English seaside, where one year he falls in with the Grace family and gets caught up in their lives. A sense of foreboding is set from the very first sentence of the book: \\"They departed, the gods, on the day of the strange tide.\\" Very compelling.<br /><br />Yet I always find it difficult to appreciate the point-of-view of a male author whose mind is fixated on you-know-what. (A book written by a friend of mine titled \\"Is That All He Thinks About?\\" comes to mind.) After awhile, I just start rolling my eyes.<br /><br />But I learned a great deal of words by reading this book: knobkerrie, anabasis, littoral, crapulent, bosky, ichor, penumbral, glair, costiveness, skiver, declivities, succubus, revenant, expatiation, apercus, maja, maenad, rubescent, canthus, armature, mandala, catafalque. My little electronic dictionary got quite a workout!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|\\"Waking The Fallen\\" is a mix of both old and new (ahem, nu). So while it may initially seem like a melodic metalcore record, which is a genre that Avenged Sevenfold have definite roots in, the more it plays, the more it becomes apparent that it also has some strong thrash, European death metal, groove metal, and traditional metal influences. And yes, there are even some nu-ish elements present, here. So, at the end of the day, \\"Waking,\\" A7X's second proper album, plays like a conglomeration of influences that range everywhere from Slayer and Metallica to In Flames and Soilwork to Killswitch Engage to Judas Priest to Deftones and Helmet.<br /><br />Its first handful of songs, \\"Unholy Confessions,\\" \\"Chapter Four,\\" and \\"Remenissions,\\" all do a very successful job at balancing metal and melody, but the most noteworthy of the bunch has got to be the latter. From its thundering drum intro to its fast, shredding guitar leads, guttural metalcore vocals, fiery, chugging thrash riffs, banging skins, and chunky rhythms, \\"Remenissions\\" delivers enough of the aggressive stuff to satisfy all heavyweights. But it also slips in a nice, flamenco guitar-sounding break, as well as a clean backing vocal line, thus making the tune's choruses really infectious and catchy. And it all comes together to form one really epic song, as it is one that clocks in at roughly six-minutes in length. (Although lead-single \\"Unholy Confessions\\" probably has the most memorable chorus, as it finds Matt Shadows crooning nasally lines so sweet and overtly sappy -- like \\"I know it's hurting you/But it's killing me\\" -- that they will have listeners everywhere blowing their nose with a pancake.)<br /><br />\\"Desecrate Through Reverence\\" morphs from a strong, churning guitar rhythm into a harmonic guitar and vocal lines section, thus echoing Iron Maiden without even the slightest bit of irony. There is another memorable, good cop/bad cop vocal trade-off present, here, and the song climaxes with an epic solo section. And the next song, \\"Eternal Rest,\\" also conjures up visions of vintage Maiden, as it begins with a blistering intro (with the guitars thrashing around recklessly) before slowing to a mid-tempo gallop threaded by twin-guitar harmonies that evoke Adrian Smith and Dave Murray. And so does \\"Second Heartbeat,\\" as it features some more soaring guitar harmonization. But for the most part, this track is actually a surprisingly heavy speed metal song that is more along the lines of Metallica, Megadeth, and/or vintage Yngwie Malmsteen. It marries a arena-ready \\"woah\\" sing-along refrain and catchy clean vocal line with surprisingly mean, buzzsaw thrash riffing. And it concludes by dropping in an exceptional, lengthy, partially melodic and partially careening solo.<br /><br />With its bullying, Pantera-worthy guitar chunk and chug anchored by tight and thrashy, near blast beat-esque drumming, \\"Radiant Eclipse,\\" continues showing off Avenged Sevenfold's heavier side. But it is almost immediately overshadowed by what comes next, \\"I Won't See You Tonight (Part 1),\\" which is, coupled together with the subsequent \\"I Won't See You Tonight (Part 2),\\" which is \\"Waking The Fallen\\"'s indisputable epic and highpoint. It opens with a cool piano bit before launching into blazing pure power metal territory, with a steady, grumbling bass line and heavy, driving guitar picking (including some Iron Maiden-meets-Judas Priest-y solo work). And then comes \\"Part 2,\\" the heavier, meaner, less melodic, and more hardcore-oriented latter half of the album's towering centerpiece. It boasts aggressive, chunky riffs, early Atreyu/Killswitch Engage-style, scratchy-sounding vocal barks (all clean vocals are put on the back burner this time around), as well as catchy, staccato hooks, and a fiery, shredding solo. The end result is a terrifically epic, seamlessly intricate, and meticulously crafted pair of songs, and one that clocks in at a whopping fourteen minutes in length.<br /><br />And the rest ofthe record isn't too shabby, either. \\"Clairvoyant Disease\\" is a gorgeous acoustic strummer peppered with screaming pinch harmonics and \\"wah-wah\\"-ish guitar hooks. It is a power ballad through and through, and one that follows the commercially accessible (if kind of predictable) verse-chorus-verse structuring, thus helping to make it even more memorable and infectious. And the set closing \\"And All Things Will End\\" begins by seemingly picking up where \\"Clairvoyant Disease\\" left off, with a melodic guitar intro that recalls vintage Eighties speed metal. But this is before the tune takes a turn for the heavier side, locking into an up-tempo, thrashing groove with Pantera-meets-Metallica chugging, and more Maiden-approved harmonies. Some epic, prog-ish, multi-parted (and exceedingly technical) guitar soloing crops up here, as well, thus serving as sort of the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Do not let the fact that it would go on to become very influential in the whole metalcore/metallic hardcore scene dissuade you; this is a true blue metal album in all but attitude. (There is very little \\"core\\" about it!) Thus, it is needless to say that \\"W.T.F.\\" might not quite attain classic levels of greatness. But it most certainly is a very good effort, and one that will greatly appeal both to the trendy, mascara-wearing, Hot Topic-going masses and the old-school/traditional metal crowds.her. \\"Clairvoyant Disease\\" is a gorgeous acoustic strummer peppered with screaming pinch harmonics and \\"wah-wah\\"-ish guitar hooks.

B002VPE1WK|2.0|I am an avid photographer and received this item as a gift.  It is my first backpack style camera bag, as I had been using a shoulder bag style one that carried one body and two lenses.  At first, I thought this was a great bag, because I could fit both of my bodies and several lenses, as well as many other accessories.  It was also much easier to carry.  Unfortunately, the quality of the workmanship is definitely not up to par with other bags, as this fell apart quickly.  The stitching is coming undone and the top handle loop tore off.  Thankfully, this did not cause me to drop the bag, as I don't think it has sufficient padding to protect the gear like it should.<br /><br />It really is too bad, because I have tried other Amazon brand items and liked them.  I gave it two stars for its roominess and adjustable compartments, but I will be looking for a different option.
067942850X|5.0|This story does not have a happy ending.  You probably already know that.  However, I felt that Jon Krakauer did an excellent job of relating the facts (as we know them) and presenting the story in an objective fashion.  It's kind of like watching the movie Titanic, it's a pretty good story, but you know that it's going to end badly.  If you buy it I hope that you enjoy the story as much as I did and thank you for taking the time to read my review.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Fun and sweet for both adults and children.  We have already watched it several times and are ready for the sequel.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hard to follow if you are a commute reader like me. But overall, loved the book. Great story, very emotional.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is a truly enjoyable read.  Toole has crafted a novel with unique characters and a singular plot that interweaves the lives of persons destined to collide in the storied setting of New Orleans.  The narration is visceral, comedic, tragic, and unapologetic as it fleshes out the tribulations of a true anti-hero.  A Confederacy of Dunces is a classic that must be read!
B005IQ5H7M|5.0|Hands down.  No matter how many times I read this novel, I always have to read all the way through nonstop.

038533348X|4.0|While I think any of Vonnegut's works would be hard-pressed to surpass Slaughterhouse-Five's mastery in my mind--a bias I maintain, likely at least in part because it was my first exposure to the insight and wonder that was Vonnegut's mind--Cat's Cradle continues his tradition of blending wry, at times absurdist humor with sharp, flexible insight into the real world. Easy and interesting to indulge in, it is populated with personality and serves, at its core, to be the very best of social commentary. It's philosophic, satirical, and plods along exceptionally written lines of truth, lies, and that ever so upbeat topic--mankind's own self-destruction!<br /><br />Er, upbeat. Yes. Well. Anyway...The story centers around the first person narration of a would-be reporter, seeking to learn more about the Hoenikker family, whose patriarch was the father of the atomic bomb. His journey carries him from small-town America and tales of midget love (no, really) to the peculiar shores of the island republic of San Lorenzo, where love, religion, and a surprise career advancement await.<br /><br />But summarizing the plot of Vonnegut novel hardly stands to do his work real justice. Without losing a beat or slowing down (it really is a quick read, mind you), it pricks, at every step along the way, at the (often absurd) building blocks of society that hold us all together, and the dependencies we weave--as well as the fact that lies, told over and over, often become our truth. With irony, humor, and a sense of terror that rings down through the ages, this delicate and intricate exploration of mankind's foibles picks not merely at the absurdity of existence, but the very substance of belief. Even the abrupt ending, while jarring, is foreshadowed well--and seems all too appropriate for the snappy style of the book's tale.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I received this item ahead of schedule. Screen protector went on smoothly and lined up with camera, speaker, and button holes. Case fit snugly, firm yet bendable, plastic, not super slick, but easy to put in and out of case. Narrow design, not going to test durability with phone in case. Initial impression: I would recommend this product for other iPhone 4s users.
B004NE2944|4.0|At first glance when I tore the envelope, I thought I got the wrong book. Instead of a blue cover shown here at Amazon, I got one of red. It's just another edition.<br /><br />The book looked almost new even it advertises good.

Every time I click on a video, a notification comes up which says &quot;vTube has stopped.&quot; and redirects me to the kindle fire home screen. EVERY. TIME. Why can't the kindle fire have a decent Youtube app? Needless to say, you're wasting your time with this app.

B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Overall a good game. Graphics look good, sound is good, controls are responsive, just take a bit of getting used to.<br />My only real complaint is the steepness of the difficulty curve later in the game. Hitting obstacles goes from doing 5% damage, or less, to nearly 20% rather abruptly . This wouldn't be such an issue if new armors weren't so costly (either in real money or time) to unlock, especially when I have to unlock side-grade armies I don't want in order to unlock the actual upgrade armors I do want. 125,000 xp to unlock the War Machine Mk I just so I can open up the Mark 42 armor just seems like a bit much, especially when I already have the War Machine Mk II unlocked in another tree.

B00CWY76CC|1.0|I have no idea if me or what but I do not like it  I had no idea in even how to do the thing .  I guess I didn't want to escape or it just was not what I expected .

B008XBCJ34|3.0|The movie and special effects are perfect, my only problem is that when I first play the 3D blu-ray the movie freeze almost at the end, I called Amazon and they promise to send me another combo pack the next business day. I am not at home at this time, but I hope when I get back the new movie is fine. Customer services in Amazon is very good.<br />I have the replacement on time as promise, means that when I got back home I have my new movie already, thank you Amazon.

B003U4UPHG|5.0|Season one has you thinking one thing and then season two changes your mind completely in what you thought was really going on. It shows how much the characters are connected even if they don't know. The plot just thickens.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Took me awhile to get used to coming from a $5 piece of crap, but this mouse is amazing. Very versatile, expansive, and customizable.
B000OY8NII|3.0|I loved the Eureka series on TV, and just bought all seasons from Amazon which were delivered promptly.  My only complaint is that the shows are SUBTITLED (called SDH, Subtitled for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing) not closed-captioned (that you can turn on and off with your TV's CC button).  I use CC often since I sometimes have trouble hearing the dialog, but there is no closed-captioning on the DVDs.  Instead they have an option to see SUBTITLED versions of the shows, which means that ALL of the dialog is shown in large white characters ALL THROUGHOUT THE SHOW. I find these subtitles annoying and distracting.<br /><br />This is apparently what Universal Studios, now owned by Comcast, does. They don't seem to realize closed captioning and subtitles are different things used for different reasons.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is entertaining for the whole family. It is reasonably wholesome and has many great discussion points. It is whimsical and fun!  I'm sad I have to wait so long for season 4!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|My kids love this movie! Came quickly and intact as stated! Will order again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so great! Way more interesting than subway surfers by far. I'd reccomend this game, however, it is laggy at the beginning.

B00124LYHQ|5.0|Certainly one of the best films he ever did. Personifies Method Acting at its best. in my opinion, in later rolls he tended to overdo/over act, but . . . Hey, Method acting almost dictates it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it because it takes me into gods way and teaches me spiritual things and I get to have a encounter with Christ.
0062278096|5.0|For a self-confessed Sherlock fan, able to watch the six shows multiple times, this is a treat.<br />Little \\"notes\\" between Holmes and Watson add a touch of humor.<br />Lots and lots of photographs in full color make for eye appeal.<br />Each show is covered.  There is a general write up, ties back to the books, considerations to modernize and incidents from filming.<br />Between the shows are sections on the writers, the actors and some history of the books and films.<br />Presentation is a combination of written and scrapbook type notes.<br />Oddly it works.  This is a fun and informative look at the people and the show.

B007TNQ7EY|4.0|A great game, that reminds me of Saints Row with the gameplay and weapons. I got the game on sale for one dollar, but I'd be fine paying the starting price of seven or the current price of five.<br />The aiming system can be a bit difficult at times, but it doesn't hinder you too much in the heat of battle, worth 4 stars.<br />The graphics are good, with no graphical bugs that I've encountered, and the animations are decent, worth 4 stars.<br />The driving, from experience, is best with the standard motion control mode, but I have a friend that prefers touch driving, with many variations of driving controls leaving something for everbody, worth 4.5 stars.<br />The combat is dependent on the controls, with enemies having good AI, despite the fact that the enemies don't often aim for allies and allies don't do too much damage, it's done in a way where it's enjoyable anyway, worth 4 stars.<br />The story is good, albeit a tad clich&eacute; in some places, but you can expect some clich&eacute;, because it's difficult to make a non-clich&eacute; gangster game. It never gets too clich&eacute;, but the story can get melodramatic in places, trying to go for emotions that they can't invoke in the player, making some cutscenes cheesy, worth 3 stars.<br />The voice acting is good most of the time, but in some cutscenes it's absolutely terrible, breaking you from anything it may have built up, but it can also give you a good laugh and a running joke if watched with friends, worth 3 stars.<br />The money system, weapons, vehicles, and store are all good,  with a style that fits the rest of the game well, though there aren't that many vehicles in the world, worth 3.5 stars.<br />The HUD is never confusing and right to the point, making it easy to just pick up and play no matter how much you game, with a helpful minimap. The HUD style fits well with the dilapidated ghetto that the game takes place in, worth 5 stars.<br />There are many interesting gameplay mechanics, with different kinds of missions, and a level system with different stats for different things like firearms skill and driving, worth 4.5 stars.<br />Overall, I'd give this game 4.5 stars if I could, but I'll just round down with four.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Let me start by saying that I loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, especially the latter which I read in one day.  So I was excited when I heard that Mr. Hosseini came out with another novel.  This book started out strong with a little boy who had his little sister taken away from him at a young age.  The entire book revolved around characters that somehow connected to these two siblings.  Unfortunately there were so many characters and plot lines that the original story got lost.  For instance, the little girl moves in with a rich family.  Not only do we hear every detail of their servant's life (who happens to be the girl's step-uncle), we learn the details of the surgeon that moved into the house later and his childhood friend and her mother.  What??  What happened to the two original siblings?  The story is full of unnecessary details and the reunion of brother and sister is anti-climactic and extremely disappointing.  There are also many chapters that start out very confusing.  You are not sure who the author is talking about because no names are given until you read further into the chapter.  Wish I could give this a better rating, but when a book becomes cumbersome it loses that desired intensity.
0143145150|5.0|I have tried to read this several times and for one reason or another, I never could get past the first few chapters.

B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Love this CD.  Maysa has done again with this CD.  The cover is gorgeous in the misty blue.  I will recommend this to my friends.
B0094LUH4A|4.0|I decided to watch this movie again and did not remember how good both Barbara Streisand and Robert Redford were. Good on screen chemistry between them.
B009X01GJ2|2.0|I have this about 7 months now- and the last few weeks I noticed marks on the screen from the straps on the cover....it has ruined the screen protector.....I just ordered a new screen protector- but I am hesitant to put it on before I order a new cover- I am disappointed with this product.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I added this hoping to watch some videos, but it continued to buffer for so long that I grew tired of it.  It also took some of my coo s,which I admit was accidental and my own fault, but now those coins have been wasted on a worthless app.  I don't expect to get those coins back, but I'm more disappointed than anything.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is so much fun my sister loves it and so do I. It's a really cool game if you wAnt to be a fashion designer<br /><br />Love<br /><br />  Emily
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really good I would recommend other people to get this game and by the way you would love the competitions and the activities
B005PK553C|5.0|I hope you open up season two soon.  Each episode keep me on my toes.  I would highly recommend this
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I loved this movie in the theatres and had to have it for additonal viewing at home. The story line is very good and the acting .. well you cant' beat it really
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a masterpiece! Everything about it, the acting, directing, atmosphere, and narrative are enthralling! I only enjoyed one other piece as much, , The Best of Youth, an Italian saga about a family's affairs from the 50's to the present. The operative word is totally AUTHENTIC . Thank you for making it available to me.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|And I was charmed (no, really) by the story Gaiman wove.<br /><br />After the last couple of (bloody awful) books I waded through, this was a treat to read, and I recommend it to anyone ready for light quick read.<br /><br />It's a bit short to deserve being called a novel, though. It's still a short in my opinion, but I'm glad I splurged a bit and bought it.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|It makes you stop and think about what's important.  It's hard to believe how devastating this disease is.  This book put things into perspective.  Good realistic fiction read.
B00CHILW64|4.0|Effects are impossibly well done, the true story is gut-wrenching, and the performances are extraordinary.  Very good story of the strength of family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so awesome. i love it .u have to get it. that is y i got it i got a high score 61,something
B000002KAT|5.0|Astral Weeks is older than I am and it's been one of my top ten favorite albums for most of my life.  There are no throwaway or filler songs here.  A must own.
0316228532|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing J. K. Rowling branch out into other subjects and I had high expectations of this novel.  Unfortunately, it felt like it was the work of someone who had never previously been published.<br /><br />The plot was thin.  There were parts I liked about it, but it felt like a commentary, not a fiction story with a beginning, middle, and end.  The book lacks structure.  There is a lot description in some areas and lacking in description in others.<br /><br />What I truly disliked about the novel is the prolific amount of profanity!  Profanity has its place in literature, but it shouldn't sprinkle every page and every conversation.  Also, with the alcoholism, the heroin, the cutting, the promiscuity, the adultery, rape, child molestation, etc, et al, I felt like I was ingesting excrement reading this novel.<br /><br />The characters were completely unbelievable because every character had an extreme flaw.  Not one character's outer appearance and actions matched their interior thoughts and values.  I would argue not even the protagonist, who is supposed to be the most \\"authentic\\" character in the book does this.  My suspension of disbelief lasted about the first chapter, then after that it left and never came back.<br /><br />I wanted to enjoy this book.  I really did.  The ending was as lackluster as the beginning and I was sitting there holding a book and feeling like I had wasted all this time for this?  I can't recommend reading this book.  I'm very disappointed and I'm not sure I want to read anything else Rowling puts out if this is her idea of adult fiction.
B005MMZ63C|3.0|Too long to get to the point. No real feeling or empathy for any of the characters. I don't like being told how many words I have to write for a review.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Best read of the summer! The story telling is romantic and lush. The characters are beautifully intricate and their stories entwine flawlessly. I didn't want it to end!
B002KLOPF8|4.0|I liked the story line and the way it progressed. What i don't like is you have to write X amount of words to do a review. I won't be opening these anymore.
B004K4IZ3G|3.0|I can see parts of this blu ray that does not show as it did in the theater and I am very disappointed.  I LOVE this movie.  LOVE it but I am not happy with the quality of this movie on Blu Ray.
140053271X|1.0|The screen is good, overall it's not a bad ereader.  3 quick issues.  First, the sticky rubber on the back is already peeling.  Second, you cannot use the nook without connecting to the internet via wifi, and the nook cannot connect to wifi that needs you to enter a password over a web browser.  Third, and worst of all, is you cannot sync books that are not purchased through nook to your phone.  This is really aggravating.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|having a great time with this game. Very addicting. Basic match 3 but love the aquariums, its fun to decorate them!!!!
B005V5WBFG|4.0|I have used McAfee for several years.  I downloaded this program for security on my Kindle tablet.  It was easy to install and I believe it keeps me safe.
B001ATN3QS|5.0|This is a great movie.  The action is energetic.  The dialogue is simple and reveals much more than what is said.  The scenery is amazing.  Enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I'm addicted to it!!! I wont get off of my kindle :3 this game is really easy also
B005HEVBGG|5.0|So excited to finally see this series. I started watching it when it started however it became unavailable so I'm thrilled to finally see it!

B009NG1Q96|5.0|I found myself incredibly sad that there won't be another book until NEXT year! What am I supposed to do until then?!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like it like I do on the PC. I can look for all my shows just like on the desk top.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I  I really love this game. It is fun and competitive with 3D and very realistic graphics. Buy the game for FREE I might add.. this is a really fun app.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great characters, compelling storylines, really fun to watch. Make all episodes of season 3 available soon!  Love the show and actually got others hooked!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Brolan is an other exceptional singer, some one I want to listen too all the time, in many ways his songs in different languages come across so true to the languages that he sings in, that I am totally amazed his music goes straight to the heart. if you really love good music then you need to buy his.<br /><br />Mickey
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a person who struggles to accept when she is wrong, yet I am so happy to be wrong about Stephen King. After toiling through King's The Stand, I was prepared to dismiss him. In The Stand King never stretched his storytelling skills. Everything escalated to the climax as one would expect and everything fell from the climax as one would expect. Ho-hum.<br /><br />But in 11/22/63, I had moments of pity for Stephen King, since he wrote himself into character dilemmas and plot conundrums that defied conventional resolution. Nothing unrolled as expected in this book. So I pitied him. I pitied King because I knew he must have passed days and weeks struggling to extract himself from these self-created authorial quagmires. At the same time I admired him because he had actually done it: he had taken chances; he had pushed the story to uncomfortable places, places where a 10¢ resolution and a bit of deus ex machina wouldn't suffice.<br /><br />The novel is a true behemoth with over 800 pages dedicated to multiple genres. And although every genre element adds to the book, its greatest weakness is how it is simultaneously so many things. Sometimes King didn't seem to know what the book wanted to be. Was it a simple time travel tale? a straight thriller? a revisionist piece of historical fiction? a small town love story? It is all of these things, but occasionally he lingers too long on one element, leading to some duller parts, especially around the middle. Yet it comes together splendidly in the end in the spectacular final 200 pages. By that point, the intrigue is staged, the characters are fully endeared to the reader and to each other, and King's daringly bold plot strands have knotted into an unsolvable mess.<br /><br />In the final chapters, every other page or so punches you in the heart. While the time travel bits keep you turning the pages--from the outset, you know that changing the past can only go poorly; the question is how will it go poorly--it is the character relationships that endure. For all of the bluster surrounding Stephen King as contemporary literature's most famous horror writer, 11/22/63 is achingly romantic. It is gentle tale, which means it is King at his harshest.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is very time consuming when bored for my kids. When they are bored.<br />I would recommend it to everyone on the word.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Great series, and even though a couple of the games are purely DLC I'm still satisfied with the purchase. I got it as a gift for my girlfriend, and it came like it said, right on the day of release.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is truely the best minecraft app it runs great on my kindle fire.<br />It is way better than survival craft and the graphics are way better to. i love survival<br />and creative they are the best.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is good but I wish the game was little harder . Other then that I would recommend this game to my friends and family.
B00BB8OHMW|1.0|I hate these cute rate movies you offer in your content...nothing really good poor selection...cant find all the movies I like...not enough classic move...to much tv garbage. I cant belive I pay for this.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Title Says it ALL ^^^^^^^<br /> I Reccomend this to anyone ever, who wants to enjoy an amazing book that keeps them at their edge of their seat the entire time!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you play puzzle games, you'll love this. by far the best. Interactive. 3d. And challenging. Once you figure out the dynamics of the game, it gets very fun.  Spent hours playing.  Lost a lot of sleep.  ONLY gripe is that it was too short. When's part two coming out?
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Hollywood is sooooo shallow anymore. It has been so long since I have seen a movie with any real content. Silver Lining Playbook is such a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood drival made just for a quick buck. This is the first review I have ever written. All I can say is if you watch this and aren't moved your dead.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|[[ASIN:B009KS4XRO Bingo Blitz by Buffalo Studios]]<br /><br />THIS GAME IS FUN FOR ALL AGES FROM 10yrs-100yrs. IT VERY FAST BECOMES ADDICTIVE.

B00821OX98|4.0|Enjoyed the series, would like to see more seasons offered on Amazon Prime streaming. Disappointed that subsequent seasons are only available on pay per view.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I am just saying that this game gets very boring so please take my advice and do not get it.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|When I first opened the app after the update I thought there was something wrong with my Kindle. It is very confusing.  Why do companies always think they have to improve something that is already good?  Please go back to the old version!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Movie was great - I had not seen all other Marvel movies until now, but am in love with them.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I FIRST PLAYED THE SONGS I'VE HEARD ON THE RADIO MULTIPLE TIMES.  ONCE I GOT MY FIX, I PLAYED THE WHOLE THING AND WAS BLOWN AWAY.  REALLY GREAT MUSIC, LYRICS THAT ARE PROVOCATIVE IN A GOOD WAY, THEY MAKE YOU THINK.  HOPE TO SEE THEM WHEN THEY ARE ON TOUR.  LOVE IT!  IF YOU HAVEN'T DOWNLOADED THIS YET, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  IT IS AMAZING.  GET IT.
1609611543|4.0|like the information given on gluten & how it effects your health-like the coordination with the cookbook which gives examples of cooking without wheat
B00CS65QGW|5.0|GREAT SONG THAT HAS A RETRO FEEL TO IT.  MAKES ME REMEMBER SOME EARTH WIND AND FIRE SONGS.  YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH ANY SONG ASSOCIATED WITH PHARRELL WILLIAMS.  MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD JUST HEARING THE SONG.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Works very well, sasy to install, quite intutive to use. Does require some practice to get around but that is true of most new things. All in all, a good app to have.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This was a little hard for me to get started ... but at 1000+ pages, there's room to develop a good story line.  His characters are richly created and filled out and his use of alternative (read sometimes strange) magic systems is pure genius.
B002SHD9E2|4.0|Not a big fan of musicals, but this was an excellent version with some great music and performances to match. Bravo!
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|Alice in chains is one of those bands whose albums I tend to buy blindly.  Unfortunately, this album seems to have missed the mark with me.  After many listens, I find that most of the songs just kinda blend together and ultimately sound too alike, preventing most of them from standing out. Individually, the songs aren't bad; if you liked the last album, most of these songs should be accessible to you.<br /><br />Of all the songs that sound like \\"Hollow\\" on this album, that song is definitely the best of them and a serviceable single. I found \\"Voices\\" to be a stand out song and would be surprised if it never hits the radio. It has less of an edge than the other songs on the album, but is very well done.  The title track, a song that will probably offend fundamentalist evangelical Christians, is also very well done.<br /><br />Other than that, there isn't much to recommend. It all just sorta blends together. Occasionally \\"Breath on a Window,\\" \\"Scalpel,\\" and \\"Phantom Limb catch my attention, but usually I just don't notice the transition between any of the songs if they aren't \\"Voices\\" or \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here.\\"<br /><br />The album would have benefited from a bit more diversity in song composition, something that Black Gives Way to Blue did well.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can't say which season I liked the best, they all have their good points.  Season 3 was excellent except for the very end which is extremely sad and shocking.  I won't give it away just incase some one wants to buy this and has not seen the ending.  That being sad...don't hesitate to purchase Season 1, 2 and 3.  Downton Abbey is wonderful!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Challenging and entertaining game. I have whiled away considerable time while attempting to earn prizes. This game would be even better if the coins recycled in 20 seconds. @
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I didn't want this book to end.  Jeffrey Archer has written a great story about some truly interesting characters.  Now I have to wait impatiently for the next book in the saga to be published  :(
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I didn't realize how much I wanted this book to be magnificently magical, ethereal and comfortable to be with, until about a third of the way in.  And now that I have absorbed the book like one of the amazingly good meals served up at the farm, I must thank Neil Gaiman for yet another wonderful reading experience! It was exactly what I hoped for.
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good movie. I was wondering if there is to be another one after this.  I would compare it to Twilight as far as a love story goes it is a triangle at first. Solving that issue at the near end was not what I was expecting though it was pleasant to see since I love happy endings.  However that would be where the comparison ends. It was a pretty good sci-fi also however I would really like to see how far she can go with this path.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this game is a great way to pass time.also play this game on facebook with friends. it go to see who can. get the highest score.
B003MXAOVM|5.0|This is a great movie that was part of my Ethics of Leadership graduate class.  I am so glad I chose this book as it clearly illustrates servant leadership.  William Wilberforce was a great leader and parliamentarian against the transcontinental slave trade.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|This could have been a really good book. Instead, it was just frustrating.  There is no character development, and no plot.  Just when the author begins to get a story started, the &#34;interview&#34; with that person ends and you start over somewhere else with someone else who has a different story.  It's my bet the author had a bunch of ideas and didn't know how to put them together, so he/she chose the laziest and easiest way they could imagine.  It's pretty much just notes about how a plague war might unfold.  I can't believe I read the whole book.  I expected it to get better, for the many different characters to somehow come together in the end, but it never happened. Wasted time I will never get back.  I don't think I will go see the movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this album.  It is toe tapping and fun to listen to.  I found them through watching Linda Sterling's video in youtube.
B007SGM084|1.0|This rating is not about the books. It is about the price. Come on Amazon! You have to do better than this for the kindle edition. You don't even get a discount for buying the bundle.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I wanted to see this from the time I saw the first trailer. Moves nicely, kept my attenttion and I wanted to see what would happen next. You know it's a good movie when you think about for the next couple of days. Invokes several emotions. Would watch it again and recommend it to others
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I just bought the film on Vudu for instant streaming and my final thoughts of the film is that it is much better then what critics say about the movie.. It had a decent plot that was exciting enough and the action scenes were paced and pretty good in my opinion. This movie won't win Best picture but is good entertainment.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|[[ASIN:B00CWY76CC Can You Escape]]<br /><br />Great for problem solving skills. Can't wait until more levels are available. Will definitely purchase the full version. Also works the memory you have to remember what you say and where it is.
1401309666|5.0|Most people don't understand the power of the internet - this is a good book to describe how the long tail has become the new normal - great book - read it.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I love Neil Gaiman's work. I have read American Gods, Neverwhere and I am working my way through the Sandman series. I read The Ocean at the End of the Lane with anticipation and I liked it, but for me it simply did not live up to the hype that surrounds a Neil Gaiman work.
1577314808|5.0|really enjoying reading this book - also enjoyed a new earth by Tolle<br />was going through a few changes in life and this book was a good reminder that there is nothing like the Present!
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Oh my god did I struggle with this.. I was told there was a great twist so that kept me reading but I soon realized it wasn't that great!! I won't even start on the absolutely stupid ending that had me wondering what the hell any1 would get from reading this book
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Great story, great casting, and a  mind-bending plot that will make you want to replay it immediately. I definitely recommend
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I love chimpact it is awesome!! I suggest getting it! It is only 99 cents!! Like I said it is awesome!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is alot more fun than temple run it has more action it's really cool. Get this game! It's free
B009WUAK2M|5.0|If you were for making a movie with all action stars, here is the movie. I only love to include Clint Estood with the crew.
B005CMSDKA|4.0|The second film together of Saoirse Ronan and director Joe Wright help cement Saoirse's fame and status as a very talented actress.<br />To do a feat like that as an actor you need an uncommon role to play and Hanna is that for Saoirse.<br />Hanna like you can read in other reviews is a teenage girl living in isolation with her father in a frozen forest training to become a perfect assassin, in any other director's hands this would have been a standard and full of cliche action flick, the kind of action film where they like to show off the arsenal and big explosions, cool clothings, cool locations and big explosions again, with catchphrases like I'll be back,so all that is what this movie is not.<br />Director Wright makes the actors face the cameras and act a lot letting us appreciate their performances, particularly you can see how good young Saoirse is at it.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Still in the process of reading it, but can tall I will be very much be looking forward to ensuing installments. Highly recommended for all ages. It at once has all the action one could wish for, but also contains a cerebral approach to personal development from a warrior's perspective. Read it.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|It's not brilliant but it's plenty of fun. Nice to see the Arnoldator back in action. A very fun rental.
B002LFPAUC|1.0|Had some good scenes and was funny in spots, but wears thin after a while. I understand it's considered the greatest comedy series of all time by the British in particular. I found it pretty stupid and a waste of time. Avoid it.
