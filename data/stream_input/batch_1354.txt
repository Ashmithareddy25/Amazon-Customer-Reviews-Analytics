0307946711|5.0|Plain and simple, I loved this book.  The truly marvelous aspect of the novel is the pure and dynamic relationship between the two main characters, Emma and Dexter. Beginning the night they met, the book chronicles the rest of their lives as their personalities and the severity of their connection morphs. Set on the exact same day year after year, it presents a very interesting take on a lifelong friendship and asks the eternal question that consistently plagues us girls: Can guys and girls ever just be friends?  The writing was phenomenal, the storyline refreshing, the European setting inspiring, but most importantly, the general message thought-provoking. Thought truly is the best reaction that a book can cause, and the reason why I even read in the first place. I want my opinions challenged, my thoughts questioned, and my dreams to evolve. This book did that.  Read it.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|this is one of the best movies of all time!!!  DO NOT REMAKE THIS MOVIE!!!  this movie is perfect as is leave it alone!!!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a very good story. The flow of the book was easy to follow and makes it a good read for younger readers. I can't wait to see the movie to see how close they followed the true ID of the book. Looking forward to books 2 and 3.

B005HBP75K|2.0|Same old same old.  I must be missing the whole point of the episode because I guess I was supposed to be worried that Jessee might be finally killed.  I wasn't.  Its too transparent at this point.  I wish they'd kill off Jessee and Skyler and get on with it.
0307887960|3.0|Way to complicated.  The book came in on time and I never got past the first 20 pages.  I'm sure it works for all those French folks, but I'll stick to eating less and exercising more.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|my daughter just adores this grocery bag game and you will too! It was very fun and educational about how eggs should go on top of the bag and milk should go one the bottom.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I don't like openfeint. It automatically connects for you with no opt-out option. Don't buy!!! Not worth it. These games with openfeint are very annoying and I wish they would get rid of it.
B003FHGI9W|5.0|As a dog lover I immediately stopped at this movie when I saw it without bothering to check the storyline.  I don't cry much but this movie will turn you into a blubbering blob by the end.  I highly recommend it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game rocks!!! WOOHOO!!! It's a great game to play when your bored. AND SO ADDICTING!!!!! I love the happy birdday update and Angry Birds is the best game ever!!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|This I can say was the best one yet!  Can't wait for part two to come out.  The wedding was beautiful and the end with her opening her eyes was a perfect place to end the first half.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This game is totally addictive and fun! However, you should have more things to unlock. I already unlocked everything on my second day!!! There should be just as much unlockables as the one on the iphone.
B004I744AS|5.0|a WEALTH of words in this app.  loving it!  there hasn't been a word that has stumped this sucker and it always has my back when push comes to shove!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|works great on the Kindle fire! Beautiful graphics, soothing music, smooth animation makes this game a nice way to wind down after a long day!

B006ON41FC|5.0|Great game designed for touchscreens! This game is easy to pick up, but hard to master in the best possible sense.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not believe how exciting this first entry in the trilogy was. I originally bought it for my daughter (9yo), but I think it might be a bit too graphic for her, so I'm going to wait another few years before introducing her to the series.  Tons of action, romance and excitement in this first entry, I am looking forward to reading the next two.
1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habit was an amazing book.  I have been reading several books that try to explain why we do what we do and this book explains all of them.  It also explains why books like [[ASIN:0553382179 Sink Reflections]] are set up to help you form new habits and, when they do, are successful.  I didn't find a step-by-step process to go through to change habits I would like to change, but it did increase my awareness of how habits drive my life and awareness is the first step to change.<br /><br />Even if I hadn't picked up this book to get ideas on how to facilitate change, I would have still enjoyed reading this book.  Duhigg grabbed my attention from the beginning with the stories of the brain injured people who were able to form habits without remembering them.  I have a friend who has had 5 brain surgeries and radiation and it has had an effect on his memory.  It has made me think about how habits could benefit him.  Moving on to making different products, such as Pepsodent and febreze, a necessary product in our lives was quite interesting.  I'm not a football fan, but still learned a lot from Tony Dungy's coaching strategies.<br /><br />Who would have thought focusing on safety could change so much for a company and how business is done in general?  Target's decision to draw in new parents is brilliant.  It's also kind of disturbing to think we can be profiled so easily.  With every page, I wondered what I would learn on the next.  There was so much information in this book.  I knew about the experiment with young children and the marshmallow to test will power.  I had not thought about teaching a child to resist temptation.  I had also not considered sports and music lessons would help to teach self-regulatory strength.  I am also passing on to my kids to use with their kids the idea of asking how they are going to know when they are prepared for a test rather than just asking if they have studied.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about the CEO of Starbucks, even though I have never been to one (I don't drink coffee).  How they train their employees should be a model for other companies.  The examples of Rosa Parks and the Saddleback Church were entertaining.  To have insight into addictions like gambling was quite interesting.  As you can see, I found The Power of Habit to be a fascinating read.  I have a feeling I will be buying additional copies to share with others.  I don't want to loan mine because I will be rereading sections I have flagged.one (I don't drink coffee).

B0063IH60K|5.0|fast, fun and easy to play with the touch screen and auto play. I would recommend as a way to kill time. You can quit midgame and your game will be auto saved.
B006ON41FC|5.0|For those of you who are complaining that you can't opt out of OpenFeint, well you can. All you have to do is go into OpenFeint, then you go to setting, then you click remove account. Also, I saw someone say that they couldn't control the music, which isn't true. All you have to do is start a round, then click pause, then in the top left corner is the option for the sound a music. I give this cute, good-quality game 5 stars.
0545265355|5.0|Art that I find most effective is art that is a true reflection of society. This is why I loved reading The Hunger Games trilogy. While most people won't be able to look past this trilogy being about a teenage girl and her inability to chose who she loves, this book is a picture perfect reflection of American society, that's if you're smart to enough recognize it. This book is a must read!!!

B00000I3JM|5.0|I too like this more than the much loved critically acclaimed hats. This sounds more like what I thought they would. Hats is just too slow to me, this has a better pace, and the melodies are more upfront. I love the story behind the group and this album. this is beautiful, and fans of a-ha, talk talk, and other atmospheric 80s groups will find much to love here.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|The much anticipated Streep's old school British ascent did not turn out to be well immitated when she went on MT's debate scenes in the parliament. Kudos to the make-up though.

B006W0QOF2|3.0|I've seen a lot of crime movies, and this one didn't offer anything that hadn't been done before.  You don't really understand the characters or why they do what they do....but worst of all, you don't really care.  It was gratuitously gory, which is a given in this type of movie, but for some reason the gory scenes didn't wrench you like they do in some movies (even some where you don't see the actual gore -- just the terse situation is enough to make you flinch knowing what is happening).  The romance didn't have any umph behind it and the one scene that was supposed to be heartbreaking was just kind of \\"blah.\\"  Not a bad movie, not a good movie.  Decent.  I didn't understand why this had so much hype -- It was kind of like watching a summer blockbuster with an \\"indie\\" soundtrack thrown in.
B006ON41FC|3.0|Fun, amusing game. Lots of goals. Shop items should have at least one low nut cost item to motivate players. Does need some platform compatability work, however as it periodically dives to the right and crashes on my samsung mesmerize, galaxy S phone
B006PHD0RW|5.0|a nice break from average puzzel games! one reason I love this game is while other games only have one objective, this game, depending on the level, has multiple objectives varying from crushing the groceries to only being able to crush three to not being able to crush any at all. all in all, the best game I have ever played on my kindle!
0689835604|5.0|My 8 month old son loves to play peek a boo and thinks this book is fun to read! I love that it is the smaller size so that he can hold it in his hands by himself.

B004MC8CA2|1.0|All of you people who have the internet and believe this garbage as fact really have weak minds, to be so closed minded as to not research anything for yourself is just sad. If you use religion as a way to hold you life together, you need to look into the history of religions. Made by weak men for weak people. Educate yourself and learn that you know absolutely nothing about anything in all of everything ever. It opens your eyes and soul so you can do better things to change the world than putting millions of dollars in marble in your church planting, telling people to worship cows, saying you're enlightened, suffering in life and afterlife, spreading the word of a hippy new as Jesus the son of &quot;God&quot;,... just be a good human being and quit labeling everything to keep playing team games against one and other. Love you all, but grow up!
0307588335|5.0|Larry McDonald chronicles the collapse of Lehman Brothers from a heretofore untold perspective: that of a Wall Street trader, an \\"insider.\\"  McDonald's riveting account of the events that led to Lehman's collapse is an entertaining read for both financial professionals and laypeople, alike.  McDonald paints a vivid picture of hubris, greed, and an insatiable lust for risk that would be the undoing of one of Wall Street's oldest and most storied investment banks and would send systemic shockwaves throughout the global economy.  As a former convertible bond trader, I was unable to put this book down...and gifted a copy to my father, a convertible hedge fund manager.  A must read.

B002BWP49C|3.0|With all due respect to folks, young and old, who love these movies I must say that I do not get all the hype about it.  It was not that good, not at all scary and a bit over the top with Bella's ridiculously sick pregnancy.  And, as in all the others in this series, Bella USES Jacob to the hilt.  She cannot make up her mind who in the heck she wants.  I can make it up for her....Jacob is the much better of the 2 men Bella has been involved with.  And, as ever, Kristen Stewart cannot act!!!

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is an impressive directing effort from Darren Aronofsky and frankly one of the best films I have seen in a while. The punchy editing and brilliant score add to the overall impact and the four main characters are very convincing in their roles. This DVD contains the original, uncut version of the film. No issues with the disc, shipped fast and a great price. Highly recommend this film!

B000JIHP88|5.0|I just got this mobile about a week ago and love it already.  I originally ordered it to give to my parents to have for their crib at their house for when my son stays with them (my mom watches him during the day when I'm at work).  We already had a mobile for our own house but I wanted to see what this one was like so I put it up in our crib (it is very easy to assemble - it takes 3 D batteries and 2 AA).  It's so cute I decided to keep it. lol We had a mobile from pottery barn kids that cost twice as much and it's not nearly as effective.  Yes, it's just about the cutest mobile I've ever seen but it's a wind up and the music is extremely loud and fast (mary had a little lamb).  My son loved to look at it but it never soothed him to sleep.  This one is amazing.  The music lasts for about 18 minutes and it has 2 volume levels.  It also has a nightlight that you can turn on or off.  And the whole thing comes with a remote control which is nice so the baby doesn't see you turning the mobile back on.  I'll probably be ordering another one for my parent's house as well.  Definitely recommend.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I almost dreaded trying this workout DVD because of what I had heard - namely that it's a tough workout. Well, the truth of the matter is that it truly is a tough workout. I started this on a Monday, and was so sore the next few days, that I couldn't do it again until Friday! Now I do this workout 3 days a week and on alternate days, use a walking DVD. After doing the Level 1 workout for a couple months, I plan to start Level 2 next week. The workouts consist of three circuits of 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of ab work. They are sandwiched between a warm up and cool down. I can hardly believe how hard this 20 minute workout is; the time goes by very fast and I am always relieved when the cool down starts. I feel like Jillian might jump out of the tv screen or start yelling at me by name if I slack off. I dont dare put in a half- hearted workout! If you want a great, compact workout that will help with weight loss and toning, don't hesitate to buy this DVD. I promise that you will see results!!

0684857219|3.0|The New Encyclopedia of Modern Building is an interesting book, as it is not exactly a fitness guide or manual. It does contain many exercises however anyone who routinely weight trains and lifts probably already knows all of the exercises in the book. This is really for students and fans of bodybuilding, the sections on bodybuilding's history are extensive as is the section on posing for competitions. This is not an exercise book for those looking to learn about new workout plans or exercises. This is not for people looking to start learning about weight training, the exercises are not described in depth and the pictures are not all that helpful (most are of famous bodybuilders, often with poor form) and what surprised me the most is that there are only a few workout plans in the whole book. The New Encyclopedia will be thoroughly enjoyed by fans of the sport of bodybuilding.
0553577123|5.0|In the nearly 70 years since the end of World War II, countless books, films, and personal accounts have captured the world's attention. We've heard and seen stories of courage, compassion, bravery, and evil. But among all of these works, one stands out, and has done so for more than half a century. It's not a soldier's recounting of battle or a politican's memoirs of a difficult decision; rather, the book that has touched us all is the diary of an ordinary teenage girl.<br /><br />Anne Frank was 13 years old when her family went into hiding above her father's business in Amsterdam in the summer of 1942. While there, they were joined by the van Pels family, as well as a dentist named Fritz Pfeffer. For the next two years, Anne chronicled her life in the \\"secret annex\\", describing the day-to-day tribulations of a group trying to survive war without the benefit of getting away from each other. They were completely reliant on their helpers for survival, and at times, they were terrified of being caught.<br /><br />As interesting as the stories of war are, what has made the diary so special is its brutal honesty. Above all, Anne Frank was a teenager. She confided her innermost thoughts in her diary, and we as readers can \\"watch\\" her grow up from a vivacious thirteen-year-old girl to a serious young lady of fifteen. We saw her fall in love, argue with her parents, feel as if she was alone in the world - all things teenagers can relate to. She was a normal girl living in extraordinary circumstances, and in many ways, she became the voice of the 6 million Jews who were killed in the Holocaust.<br /><br />\\"The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition\\" is a re-release of Anne Frank's originally published diary, with some additions. After her father's death in 1980, additional diary pages were found and published. Some of these came from Anne's own re-writes, while others had been deleted by Otto Frank in its original publication. It is NOT the version that is often read in schools; Anne was a curious teenage girl and was brutally honest with that curiosity in her diary. But it's that honesty that manages to capture all of us.in schools; Anne was a curious teenage girl and was brutally honest with that curiosity in her diary.

B005QUQ99K|5.0|This LEGO Ninjago set was the smallest of the five that my son received for his birthday, but is far from being his least favorite. Styled a bit like the futuristic cycles seen in movies like [[ASIN:B002ZG99QS Tron: Legacy]] or in the Japanese Anime classic [[ASIN:B00005JG6Q Akira]], this motorcycle looks extraordinarily cool! Most LEGO cycles are small things - barely large enough to hold a minifig. Not this one! This cycle is larger than a lot of LEGO car sets! Being a fairly small set, my son put it together in about 15 minutes. Compared to other Ninjago sets, the price on this one is much more reasonable, too. Gotta love that!<br /><br />If you've got some boys at home who love LEGOs, they'll surely be happy with this set! Five stars for this one!
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|Another tremendous version of the world's great album! I have always love Pink Floyd's music and even though this isn't \\"new\\" music, I enjoyed listening to this version as well. The clarity of it almost as good as the MFSL version!

0312641893|5.0|My Review:<br />I read this book as part of our Chick Lits Book Club. I had seen the hype around the book when it first came out and was intrigued, but not enough to add it to my TBR. As a result, I was pretty excited when it was chosen as our book club read for February. I am even more so now. This book was so good and I NEED to chat with someone about it.<br /><br />Easily put, Marissa Meyer is absolutely brilliant. She took the classic Cinderella story and perfectly translated it into an incredibly creative and unique book that was so entertaining.<br /><br />In this world, which is set far into the future (after WW4,) Cinder is a cyborg, although she manages to hide that fact for the most part. She was hurt in an explosion at the age of 11 and they had to implant the cyborg parts. She doesn't remember her life from before the implants. Cyborgs are second-class citizens. There is lots going on in this world, but at the forefront is a horrible plague that is spreading which has no cure. It was that plague which caused her adoptive father to die and for her to be left with an unloving mother/guardian and two sisters. Cinder is a mechanic and the sole means of support for the family, but that doesn't keep her guardian from abusing her mentally.<br /><br />Prince Kai comes into the story when he brings his android to her market stall to be repaired. No one knows that he is there. His father, the emperor, has contracted the plague and is dying. Kai is dealing with a lot of stresses in his life as he faces the death of his father and becoming ruler at the young age of 19. Facing a probable forced marriage to the Queen of the Lunar planet is adding to that stress. Of course, you know the story of Cinderella, so you can see where this is going...and yes, there is a ball coming up within a week after they meet.<br /><br />There have been so many reviews written about this book that I don't want to rehash, but what is amazing to me about it is that there are still a TON of unresolved issues at the end... a TON! There is no HEA to this book. But I didn't feel like we are left hanging. I thought how the book ended was perfect. Do I want to read the next book? Absolutely! I am so excited to see where this series goes and how it does all become resolved, but I wasn't left with that unsettled, unsatisfied feeling that so many series books leave you with. Ultimately, I thought that the book was brilliantly written and I can guarantee you that I will not be debating the purchase of the next three books. I recommend this one!e is no HEA to this book.

B004UXUX4Q|4.0|A man is having the worst time of his life whilst dealing with a wife in coma, a ten year old daughter and another seventeen year old daughter who're all relentless and unforgiving towards him. For Clooney who plays the man things are unraveling faster than he can possibly catch his breath. The Descendants is one of those films that come once in a way and they have the discerning eclipsing element of moving you with just srark reality.<br /><br />Not a single friend of mine agreed to go for this film with me. The ones who'd already seen the film seemed to have forewarned others about the film's lack of entertainment. It seems people don't go to the films anymore in search for what I would term as the truest form of a drama. Anyway, so I had to see this film at home and I really loved it. I knew I wanted to watch this film when I heard the reviews (same exact words from all my friends)<br /><br />My favourite scene involves the protagonist running senselessly as if it his sense of dignity he is running after. The Descendants with it's uniquely executed well studied storyline seemed to be an imperative formula I thought despite it's DARK sense of humor that may stump most viewers.<br /><br />The film is a wonderful study of superficiality and on a side note it was also interesting to watch how well the director Alexander Payne managed to catch the sheer ungratefulness of rich kids who've inherited a large wealth. The emotion or lack of is captured masterfully in a scene or two.<br /><br />Overall, Clooney acted so well, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets the nod for the best actor in lead role.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|At first listen I was a bit disappointed, only because of the production.  I was hoping for a more live sounding album, like the production on the first six with Roth.  But after multiple listens, I have become ok with it.  All the songs are great, and Roth and Ed back together is like chocolate and peanut butter.  I do miss Mike's vocals, but Wolfgang has really done a nice job, vocally, and playing some badass bass as well.  For a band that has been so dysfunctional, it's amazing they even made an album, but to make one this good after all this time, is simply amazing.  Is it as good as the first six with Roth....only time will tell.  But for a band this old, and non productive, this album kicks ass!  If your a fan of this band, your a fool not to buy this album.

B004UFEJS0|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you are missing out.  Pixar pumps out hit after hit.  This combo pack offers great flexability to watch in awesome HD at home and still have a copy to take on the road for the kids to watch.  The Blu Ray is stunning in HD.  On ign.com they rate the scene when Remy first eyes up Paris as one of Pixars top 10 scene's on Blu Ray.  I would have to agree.  The colors are vibrant and spot on.  I didn't notice any blurring or defects in the quality of the Disc.  If you don't have this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack in your collection you are missing out.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I read some of the reviews that were less than five stars and I don't know what the heck those people are talking about.  I have a Kindle Fire and it fits perfectly.  The straps hold it tight, the edges of the 'Fire are completely within the edges of the cover, and it closes flat like a book.  It doesn't look like plastic or vinyl or silicone...it looks like and feels like leather and is very tasteful and classy.  I really don't understand the negative reviews at all....it's like those people are describing a completely different product than what I bought.  I'm 100% satisfied.  So much cooler than anything available for the ipad.
B000002KO3|4.0|Talking Heads are really unknown to me in spite of having occasionally been aware of their music while listening to radio.  The 'Houses in Motion\\" track caught my attention at a local hangout and I ordered the album on which the track was released. I think the synthecized background caught me, initially. This sound is pervasive in the album.  Turns out, the other tracks on the album (which sadly only contains the minimum songs) are mostly so much better than my targetted track, 'Houses', that I don't even catch the tune when I play the album...several other tracks are catchier, and better.  I think Talking Heads is a quality band, though they would have to do something better to have me purchase another of their cds.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I give this game 5 stars. they have the new update. so they have toolbox and buzzbox. this game is 7p there with angry birds for me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great with lots of variety bit the diamond box game I can never beat! ugh don't get this game unless u wanna be frustrated all day!!!!!!!
B002NT3B52|5.0|This is a wonderful book and I think it's a particularly important read for new owners.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers have taken issue with the author's comments on letting dogs touch when they encounter each other.  I completely agree but I also understand why people hesitate based on bad experiences.  The problem is, I don't think they understand why they've had those bad experiences.  For one thing dogs rely on sign language and a tight leash on a dog is a little like putting duct tape over someone's mouth.  You just can't quite make out what they are saying.  I see many owners pull back sharply on their dogs when they get close to each other.  What the dog sees is a dog coming towards them with its front legs in the air.  Might that look like aggression?  I've seen dogs acting playful/passive right up until the owner yanks the leash causing the dogs to begin snarling and barking at each other.  The other thing I've noticed is that dogs that haven't been adequately socialized in their first couple of years seem to not learn the language of playful intent.  I think the owner needs to take this into account when encountering another dog and use their own judgement.  Early socialization, taking into account the need to let dogs expressive themselves without our interference, is important to being well behaved when encountering other dogs later in life.  I've also noticed that dogs if left alone will generally \\"work it out\\".  Even poorly socialized dogs don't want to fight.  They may not initialize play and become \\"friends\\" but they will respect each others space and find ways to peacefully coexist in the same space.
1419702238|5.0|with the wimpy kid do it yourself book, you are  the author,illustrator,and main character. Filled with loadsof interactive pages and plenty of space to write your own life's story . Is perfect for kids never getting boring. This book is all you need to create your masterpiece. Whatever you do,make sure  you put it someplace safe after  you finish far away from your sister.....lol.
B004YKB50Q|5.0|This is one of the best cd of YES. The whole album is good. I never tire of listening to this album
B006ON41FC|5.0|What could be more fun than smashing squirrels into trees at high speed? Helmet optional, graphics are above par and framerate is smooth on a SGSII.  A little blood and broken teeth on impact would make this game complete.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|The movie should be nominated as the RAZZIE Worst Movie of the Year.  Trust me.  You may be really sorry if you rent or buy this piece of merde.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Enjoyable and addictive &quot;volume&quot; puzzle game with different modes to play. Fit as many groceries as you can in the sack without breakage.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|like the title says cheese is better than this book and i do not like the lady or the dude  cheese i tell you!!!!!
B006ON41FC|1.0|Chalk me up as another user that uninstalled because Open Feint is set to auto log in. Not acceptable and the development should know better.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|This game looks nice but it is a little hard to navigate from map to map they could have made it more flowing. Puzzles are easy enough to solve it just gets boring.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy youversion Bible app. The easy sharing of my favorite Bible verses, and the red writing for when Jesus is speaking was a must when I was trying to decide which app to use. Highly reccomend this easy to use and easy to read app.
B006ON41FC|4.0|If your worried about the low rating, its simply due to the Open Feint. The game works fine and is quite fun. And like others have pointed out, just click the O.F. icon and say No Thanks. And really, who cares about O.F. anyhow? Does it ruin a game? I don't think so. Gun Bros, GLWG, Stupid Zombies... the list goes on. Rating a GOOD game 1 star over that is childish, imo. Try the game if it looks interesting/fun, because I don't think you'll be disappointed. Great game, and I hope it continues to get supported.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|l think it is an amazing app and that every one should get it don't listen to any body else's opinion it is realy fun get it know!!!!!!!!!!!
B006ON41FC|4.0|the game is fun. but it can get very laggy at times and that always makes you hot a tree. other then that I have had no problems w it on my kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I bought the game a month ago and have really injoyed it the apps are fun but the graphics need a little help
B006ON41FC|4.0|I'll remove ONE star for the auto openfeint login, bit it's clear that the vast majority of reviewers here are destroying this game's rating because they came from an anti-feint site or forum that suggested they come here en-masse to give the game a one star rating. Look at the reviews! Tons of positive reviews in a row, followed by a sudden deluge of anti-feint nuts! The only thing feint collects is anonymous rankings, so what &quot;privacy&quot; is being violated, I have no idea. Good job being moronic sheep. Even if the developers remove openfeint entirely, it will take forever for their review scores to recover. Rate the game on ALL of it's merits, not exclusively on one feature you don't like. Idiots.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|keeps me occupied, nice to be able to play different games, and what else could you ask for being free
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this app! It's fun to play and makes time go by a little quicker when i need it to. The games do take a minute to catch on to due to the fact that i couldn't find any instructions but other then that it's great!
B006PGL7OQ|4.0|many people comment on the pace of the film (yes its a necessary evil), it takes you in, the film looks like its going one direction and then SLAPs you the other direction CRAZY GOOD.
B006ON41FC|1.0|And an app that FORCES open feint will not get a positive review. Unfortunately I dl'd the faotd in the very early AM before other reviewers advised of the forced feint. The dev probably forced it because so many people don't want to &quot;have fun&quot;, do they get a kickback from advertisers on feint? Just wondering.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I really wish there was an opt out option. seems like a fun game too. But unless this changes I won.t be down loading. Faotd
B006PHD0RW|5.0|love it if u like puzzle game this is the 1 for u I recomended u will love it by the first puzzle u get
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I loved everything about this movie. Ryan Gosling performance was amazing. Loved the cast, the story line, the effects, the action, the emotions & the gruesomeness! It was a love story, horror film and action flick all in one. If you don't love this movie your an idiot! Best movie I have seen in a looong time.
B000002BYA|5.0|This is definitely one of the best live albums ever recorded, and a \\"must have\\" for any SRV fan. This was recorded on October 4, 1984, before Reese Wymans was added to the band. However, the legendary Dr.John from New Orleans played the keyboards. Plus, the legendary Texas Blues Singer, Angela Strehi (from Austin, TX) sings vocals on the song \\"C.O.D.\\"  The Line-UP includes:  Stevie Ray Vaughan - Guitar & Vocals  Chris Layton - Drums  Tommy Shannon - Bass  Other  Musicians:  Jimmie Vaughan - Guitar  Dr.John - Keyboards  George Rains - Drums  Angela Streli - Vocals on \\"C.O.D.\\"  The Horn Section:  Bob Enos - Trumpet  Porky Cohen - Trombone  Rich Lataille - Alto Sax  Greg Piccolo - Tenor Sax  Doug James - Baritone Sax  The liner notes provide a photo of all these musicians involved in this \\"Classic\\", live performance album, plus a written essay describing the details of this concert. SRV had just turned 30 years old the day before this legendary concert, and in the notes, SRV is quoted as stating that after this concert: It was \\"My best birthday ever....forever\\" SRV 10/4/84. I highly recommed this one for any SRV and/or Blues Rock fan. Thanks and I hope this review has been helpful.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love this. Great game for kids and adults. Very addicting!  I want to get 3 stars on all levels b4 my kids. Lol
B001CDL6ZM|2.0|If you want the vinyl pressing as a collectable, then go right ahead. If you want better sound than the horribly compressed CD mastering, prepare for disappointment. They simply used the CD for the vinyl master. Sounds awful.
B006ON41FC|5.0|awesome game , very fun application . what is fein though . darn. flying rats . can't wait til next game from these folks .
B003K025QO|5.0|This vinyl pressing is simply gorgeous in every way. Beautiful packaging, dead silent vinyl, and good mastering all in one glorious package. If you're a fan of the band and have a halfway decent turntable, this is an essential purchase. I always adored the album, and now it sounds even better.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great weather guide.  Very easy and fast to get info I need.  Great that it has flexibility to select different locations to compare weather.
0545403359|3.0|I looked forward to reading this book having heard such wonderful reviews however, it was disappointing and really turned out to be a book directed more to a younger reading age.  It was cute more than it was exciting or interesting.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This cd is great!  If you like their music...I'd say get this!  I bought one for myself and as a gift for my dad and he loved it as well!
B006N0YWGY|5.0|the kids love.  the loves it.  the graphics are pretty good.  what else can I say.  I recommended you give it a try.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case works really well.  Very flexible but still pretty tough!  Doesn't fold and stay upright with any type of vibration or bumping but still very nice.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|its sucks its story is dumb its acting is horrable just dont get it by the way mpaa make a good movie 4 once
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|I purchased this silicone case in May 2011, and have been using it every day since (almost a year now). There are a great number of iPhone skins and cases available, at a variety of prices, and a variety of designs. This one suits my needs perfectly. Here's why:<br /><br />* Inexpensive. I see no need to spend $40-50 for an iPhone cover. I'm not trying to win a fashion show. The simple black works great for me.<br />* Protection. This soft silicone rubber cover provides excellent cushion for the phone. It is also very grippy, and keeps the phone from sliding on smooth surfaces, holds on steady in places like car dashes, etc.<br />* Easy-on, Easy-off. This is probably my toughest requirement for an iPhone cover. Most of the time I leave the cover on, but there are times I don't want it on, or cannot have it on. Many docks are designed to fit the iPhone precisely and you cannot use them with any skin or cover on. I have such a dock in my car that integrates the phone to the car - and must be able to quickly and easily remove the cover to dock it. I also sometimes need to remove the cover to keep the phone in certain pockets, like blue jeans. The grippy cover is great until you're trying to pull the phone out of your pocket - and you wind up getting the whole pocket inside out doing it. This cover slips over the iPhone easily and quickly, just as removing it.<br /><br />In nearly a year of steady, daily use, this cover just lasts and lasts. There is no cracking, no stretching. This was a great investment, and I will gladly buy another to replace it - should that need ever arise.
B0062P3392|5.0|I was interested in seeing this movie from the get go!  With a cast such as this, I was sure the movie would be pretty good.  Plus, it's based on actual events.  Normally when it comes to action movies, I'm more into the blockbuster, guns blazing & lots of explosions type action & whatnot...but I do like some decent action thrillers thrown in here & there as well, and I would have to say that I really liked this one.  After having seen it, it kinda reached my list of favorite action thrillers.  If you're into action thrillers at all like me, I would recommend checking this one out if you haven't already.  Good stuff!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is so much fun!!!! I told myself \\"I will play it 3 times than stop\\". I actually played for 3 hours. It is the best game ever! I'm glad it was the free app of the day.
B006ON41FC|5.0|well I had one mistake witch was when the screen went black but all I had to do was press home and get on again. But it really is mybnew favorite app!! it should he rated 5 stars
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is THE most addicting game ever! i luv it! its a bunch of classic mini games that makes it al the better!! its a must have please download it!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Fun puzzle game. Good graphics, nice sound, not too easy and not to hard. Lots of fun and lasts quite a bit of play time!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. I just love ky. it is so so so fun. I think everyone should download this cool game
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My husband got me a Kindle Fire; he also got me this case few days afterwards.  This is just prefect for it since I personally do not like a leather case and prefers simple, functional and light case.  This is easy to install.  It works well with my Kindle Fire, has nice quality and just what I wanted.  I am glad I got a dark color since others who got light colors had issues with cleaning the case.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoyed this game I play it while i poop and or have a smoke. while driving it isn't a good idea
B003YCOIFY|5.0|I purchased the BoB DVD about 10 years ago and just as 95% of the viewers agreed the BoB brings it all to the small screen in terms of action, character likeabilty, sentimental moments that brings tears to your eyes and historical accuracy.  The BlueRay extra features of the time-line information track and the actual veteran character accounts make the DVD just outstanding.  I would recommend this to all, especially the big fan BoB that already have the DVD but would greatly appreciate the BlueRay upgrade.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|At the age of nine, my father took me out of school to see the movie Gladiator. You may wonder why in the world would my father take me out of a school to see a movie. The reason was that Gladaitor was a much more educational thing to do than half a day of thrid grade. The movie illustrates war, love, and honor better than any of its predicesers including Braveheart. The first scene of the movie is one of the greatest battle scences ever created to this day. The battle tactics and realities of war were more vivid in this piece than many people were willing to imagine. Even the almighty Roman Empire sustained extensive casualties and injury. The movie then goes on to show how Maximus is captured and forced into being a Gladiator for another mans profit. This and war were the two most common ways a man became a Gladiator. Maximus then with the seeking of vengence out matches every Gladiator in the known world and causes the Emporer Commodus to fight him in an attempt to rid him of all that he meant. In actual history Commodus did actually fight as a Gladiator for fun, but his actual unduing was the Praetorian Guard. This movie shows an acurate amount of history on the history of Gladitorial fights and of the Emporer Commodus and Roman warfare. I would rate this movie as one of the greatest in the history of moving pictures and suggest this to anyone who would enjoy a great movie.
B000X107GI|5.0|I posted a bad review, which turned out to be my mistake.  I read from the wrong scale on a battery tester.  These batteries don't list an expiration date, but they do test in the green, and they worked in the device.<br /><br />My apologies to the seller.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game , its addicting and has a GREAT concept. I enjoy this app very much. Please rate it 5 stars when you do your reveiw.I highly reccemond this game .
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is great all you guys who say this is sloppy work THAN MAKE YOUR OWN GAME loosers I love this game and that's it
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|I'm not going to write a review about this movie that talks about how sheer video quality and the degree of animation make this movie 5 stars, sure they are great, but I am going to write about why I think people should watch this movie. I think anyone who is a fellow racer like myself can enjoy this movie. It truly capture the feelings that go through you mind just before a race and shows how after a race begins everything is unpredictable and that the racer must learn to compensate for those events. I'm not saying that this film a summary of a real race...no it is a movie and it never tries not to be, but it truly shows you what racing is and how every person is involved in racing for a different reason.  So if you want to see an awesome movie about racing complemented with non-stop action and a bunch of explosions in a crazy mechanized future watch this movie  .
B006ON41FC|4.0|it is a cute and funny game. fun for the kids. cause I am a kid and I think it is fun
0446547603|1.0|I knew going in this was not going to be anything brilliant--I've read a Sparks novel here and there, generally for the chuckles I get out of them, so I had a pretty good idea of what to expect. I just don't think he's a good writer--wooden, overly simplistic prose, poorly-drawn, unrealistic characters, and plots so ridiculously cliche I can predict everything that is going to happen merely by reading the summary. However, I honestly believe this is the worst of the bunch so far.  Warning: this review will contain spoilers, so if you have not yet read the book, proceed with caution.  I was genuinely baffled by five star reviews of this book gushing about all the twists and turns it took, in particular the twist at the end. I knew how nearly every single scenario was going to turn out, which means either I need to take up a career in communicating with spirits on the other side...or this book was far too predictable. The twist at the end of the book is a dead horse that has not only been beaten by a stick, but spit on and otherwise defiled in any way imaginable. Please, for God's sake, just let the poor thing RIP.  The abusive husband is a joke. He is not menacing, and I felt none of the tension I'm certain his pursuit was supposed to elicit, simply because he was so laughably one-dimensional. He's the bad guy because he is a jerk who's mean to his wife and...well, because the story needed a bad guy. That's about it. We know he's a drunk and an ass and a good detective. We know this, because Sparks beat us over the head with these facts about as many times as the stick came down on that poor horse. I might have sincerely considered throwing the book across the room after reading 'He was a good detective' for about the 800th time, if not for the fact that it was an e-book uploaded to a $150 Nook.  There is no subtlety here--we know Katie/Erin is going to shoot her husband at the end of the book because Sparks feels it is necessary to mention several times that she does not like guns. We know Katie/Erin will experience a revelation in regards to what she wants out of life, namely that nothing would make her happier than being a mother to Alex's children and a wife to the man himself, because Sparks cannot write a character flaw to save his life, and what woman WOULDN'T want a man who is handsome, charming, kind, an amazing father, and to boot, probably does not even smell when he exits his bowels?  The romance is the same old formulaic crap. One date is all it takes for both characters to fall madly in love, to realize it, and to proclaim it to one another. What follows is something idyllic and diabetes-inducing sweet, without any conflict other than a brief attempt at a fight, and a little completely unbelievable hemming and hawing courtesy of Katie, who is not sure how much of a commitment she can make to Alex and his children with her husband still on the prowl. I'm not even going to comment on the dead wife angle; I'm still laughing over how contrived all that was.  To summarize: this novel was boring, unbelievable, predictable, and without a single redeeming quality. If you want anything with even a semi-decent plot and character development, I would suggest you keep looking.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|This album is great! 5 stars all the way. I wish there were bonus points/stars to add because I would.  I think it is funny the people that are complaining about things such as the production value and Michael Anthony not being there. What about just rating the music and songs? They complain about these other things because they cannot bring themselves to admit that these songs kicked their asses!  This album is pure Van Halen and kicks ass!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0393064476|1.0|This book is most definitely NOT about \\"How the World Became Modern.\\" It should have been titled \\"The Intrepid Pagan Book Hunter.\\"<br />1. 95% of this book is about the life and times of Poggio in the 15th century and how he found the Lucretius poem - \\"On the Nature of Things.\\" There is bit on the small amount actually known about Lucretius himself.<br />2. The last chapter is basically an epilogue that mentions various individuals who were aware of the poem and/or had copies. He seems to make a big deal of Thomas Jefferson having had five copies.<br />3. There is zero substantive evidence of how this particular poem had profound impact on key figures who actually did contribute to making the world modern: Galileo, Newton, Watt, Darwin, Einstein, Bohr, Lister, Keynes and many, many others.<br />4. He never defined what he means by \\"modern.\\" The implication is that modern means abandoning the dogma of the Catholic church and embracing science. I am 100% in favor of abandoning dogma and embracing science, however, Lucretius' poem in not science. It is speculation and philosophy. He had no more tangible basis for his ideas, including atoms, (which Greenblatt harps on about endlessly) than the notion of the elements being earth, wind and fire.<br />5. To have actually delivered on the advertised topic of the book, he needed to have shown how modern scientific ideas developed, who developed these ideas (see very partial list in item 2 above) and what specific impact the Lucretius poem had on them compared to and contrasted with the plethora of other influencing factors.<br />6. The book is hugely inflated with barely relevant digressions and many irrelevant details. He constantly uses long lists of descriptors when a single word would be better; he includes lengthy quotes from individuals of no relevance to making the world modern; but far fewer direct quotes from \\"On the Nature of Things.\\"<br /><br />If your passion is the hunt in the 15th century for writings from ancient Rome, this is the book for you. If you are actually interested in \\"How the World Became Modern,\\" this book is an exasperating total waste of time.. If you are actually interested in \\"How the World Became Modern,\\" this book is an exasperating total waste of time.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I refuse to use Feint, won't even bother with this until Feint is something that I can opt out of.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game that has enough challenging levels to keep ya entertained but plenty of easy enough games you can keep opening new ones.  Great to open up and play for just a few minutes or an hour.
B006ON41FC|1.0|thank you to those of you who said they did not give the opt out option of the Openfeint .... I will not be downloading this game. looks cute. oh well.
B006ON41FC|5.0|an amazing game with super cute graphics achievements are fun goals to try to get and the items you can get in the store remind me of temple run in a way
B006ON41FC|4.0|Those using a Kindle Fire, tap the Kindle's Menu button at the bottom of your screen while the game is PLAYING. On the lower right hand side of the screen you'll see two wide lines ( the PAUSE button). Tap the button to Pause the game & a screen will pop up asking if you want to Quit, Retry or Resume. Above that window on the right is a small speaker and a musical note. Tap the speaker icon. The musical note icon disappears.  You will no longer hear the music now.<br />In spite of OpenFeint, I found the game the game to be addictively fun. For me, it's a keeper. If you don't have too many internal downloads or running apps in the background, it should run flawlessly on the Kindle Fire.
B000001E18|5.0|This album is amazing.  It's lighthearted, goofy, funny, and not about mind-numbing depressing political issues.  That's the best part of it.  It's definitely a perfect album as there are no lemons.  Speaking of which, \\"Lemon\\" is probably the best of the best, with its harmonies in the middle-8: \\"a man makes a picture, a moving picture...\\".  I also loved Bono's falsetto.  Other highlights of the album include the keyboard riff in \\"Dirty Day\\", the sturm-und-drang piano riff at the start of the title track, the synthesizer intro to \\"Babyface\\", Edge's vocal in \\"Numb\\", and...who didn't love Johnny Cash's vocal on \\"The Wanderer\\"!  Put out that fire, get down off that tree, blow off the homecoming and haul a$$ to the zoo. If you haven't heard this yet, first sample this baby \\"achtung\\". If you don't wish to wait 18 years for it to come in the mail, get the download.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I've actually put off buying this app for a long time waiting for Lightning Bug to be available on the Amazon Appstore. Then one day I just decided I would buy this app just to try it. Even though Lightning Bug is now also available on Amazon, I have no regrets. This is a great app.  I've used Lightning Bug for a long time and I had considered it my favorite sound machine app out there. with Sleepy Time, it now has a real rival. Well now that I think about it, I haven't used LB since I bought Sleepy Time.  Honestly, when I first ran across the Sleepy Time app, I didn't give it more than a 5 second glance. The gui was definitely not as fancy as the app I was looking for. I waited some time for LB, contacted the developers, and waited a bit longer. When I received a response from the LB developers saying that they had plans for a release on Amazon but \\"[did] not have a date at this time\\" (Jan 11th, 2012), I decided to just buy Sleepy Time before trying it. I've used it exclusively now for over a month and have recommended it to many friends.  My reasons for 5 stars:  - Works flawlessly with no pauses/skips on my devices (Aria, Inspire, kFire);  - Sound quality is great;  - Lots of sounds to choose from;  - New sounds are updated (free) and not sold as a separate add-on;  - Ability to choose and download only the specific sounds you want;  - Ability to set sound play duration;  - Ability to mix sounds (3 max) and save them as a preset;  - Ability to adjust the volume of each sound in your mix;  This last point was rather big for me. I love the ability to customize my sounds (louder rain, more wind, softer thundering, etc).
0307593312|5.0|Since devouring Philip K. Dick's novels decades ago, I have not been too interested in books that border on fantasy, science fiction, or even magical realism (although one cannot help but read a dystopian novel now and then). But Murakami: his books are indescribably addictive. I like writers who do not show off. I like writers who tell a compelling story. And I especially like writers who share my vision of the world \\"as an incredibly strange place,\\" as a San Francisco Chronicle reviewer put it. What appears to be the ordinary is a mask for a Mystery beyond measure, as life appears to me, and somehow Murakami puts this vision on paper without being too cute, too arcane, or too supernaturally weird about it. His prose is ordinary; his world is not. I am a fan of almost all of his books. This is one of his best.<br /><br />It may be just a coincidence, but I've been to Japan on three different occasions, and found it both ordinary and magical in much the same way I feel when immersed in one of Haruki Murakami's books.
B0057R5XRG|3.0|Amazon's price for this film is more than reasonable, having explored many other options and found Amazon's price to be nearly $20.00 cheaper than BestBuy, Staples, Target, Walmart.com, etc.  Excellent choice, though I do have one minor complaint:  the packaging was slightly damaged.  The DVDs themselves were wrapped in plastic and in excellent condition, but the outer sleeve wasn't wrapped (which is normal) and came with considerable damage on the bottom lefthand corner.  For someone that is very detail oriented, this is annoying.<br /><br />Even with the disappointing condition of the packaging, I still think this movie was well worth the purchase.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I didn't even tried. I also hate openfeint so this one didn't stand a chance on my phone. Thanks for the reviews.
B002ZBJ6SY|4.0|This album includes the 12 tracks released on Disclaimer, and then 8 new tracks, so I'd recommend that you just buy Disclaimer II, as it'd be a waste of money to get both.  This is a very diverse album, with many heavy songs, many rock songs, and a handful of nice songs. The first 12 tracks (The ones from Disclaimer) are generally heavy, with the except of Broken and Fade Away, which are nice, soft songs. Fine Again is by far my favorite song out of these 12, and the whole album. The last 8 track are why Seether re-released Disclaimer as Disclaimer II; they're the new tracks. They tend to be alittle light, but are still generally heavy. Love Her and the remake of Broken with Amy Lee (Singer of Evanescence) are the two nice tracks in this group, and stand out very nicely.  Some tracks that stand out are:  Fine Again- Best song on the record. Everything about it is great, except for that fact is ends eventually.  Gasoline- A great heavy rocker.  Broken- Both version of this song are amazing, and I go through phases where I like one better than the other. Right now, I    like the one without Amy Lee better.  Driven Under- A great song.  Fade Away- A great ballad, love it.  Overall, its a great album. Like every other Seether album, the instruments are amazing. Shaun's voice is the most aggressive on this album, and his guitar work compliments this. Dale's bass is the same as always, which isn't a bad thing. He backs up Shaun perfectly. The drums are good too, even if they had like 3 drummers perform on this album. Pat Callahan's guitar work (for the tracks he performed on) is good. Overall, a great album.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really enjoy the \\"plans\\" on this app. You can select the type of plan you want to do and set daily reminders. I do have some trouble with this app closing on me and itupdates a lot but besides those minor annoyances it is fabulous!
B003L77TZI|5.0|This was a gift and the person receiving the gift absolutely loved it. She stated it is everything she thought it would be and more: some of the songs light and humorous and some more serious in tone, she said gave the entire album a nice balance.  She was very thankful for this gift and is pleased to have it in her collection.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|felt polished, new variations of a tried and trusted concept, fun had by all ages here.  was free, but worth the dollar they are asking.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I can't believe Adele was only 21 years old when she made this album! In my opinion, every song on the album is a winner and beautifully produced as well.  Was amazed at the warmth and depth of the sound quality of this CD which I believe is missing from much of current digitally produced music.  Appreciated the fast shipping,also. Thanks, Amazon!
B006ON41FC|1.0|I won't even download this because of openfeint. I don't want it. Don't care about it. And I don't consider it fun.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. There are goals to reach &amp; unexpected outcomes that I really enjoy. This is the first FAOTD that I have been able to play before my son.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I've seen the movie on TV several times, but wanted to see it from start to finish without commercials. Still like the movie a lot and was surprised that the commercials didn't cut much, if any, of the movie.  Still, there is a lot to be said for continuity.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|I said the same for his other cd I purchased, titled \\"These Streets\\". If your not in on watching this guy rise to the top...your totally missing out. He's got the universal influence of sound, touching your soul while fondling with styles to the likes of Elvis, John Lennon, Otis Redding and Marvin Gaye, all the way over to big band type music like Brian Setzer Orchestra. All the while, distinguishing himself in his own way and he's still SOOO young which really puts the icing on the cake. Buy the cd...and the others to support him and really study his music. It's phenomenal. You won't be disappointed.  End of story. :-)  MY HOPES ARE HIGH BUT MY EYES CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY SEE. OH, GIVE ME SOMETHING TO BELIEVE...GIVE ME SOMETHING TO BELIEVE.
B006ON41FC|3.0|Kind of like that Dead Runner game that was the faotd awhile ago. Same concept, whether it with paper airplanes, a ghost or a squirrel, this game has been done before. Nothing out of the ordinary. However, I do love these types of games! Very fun

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is full of features that help you read and understand the Bible. In so doing your journey to God is made easier and much richer.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I love the concept for this show, it is very imaginative and creative. I can't wait until each weeks episode, and my expectations have been met on a weekly basis. I am never sure what to expect will be coming around each corner and I think that is what makes this Once Upon a Time so great. Definitely the best show of the season!
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|Thought this was GREAT! Yes it is a sequel - but much better than the 1st for small children.  There is action, music, dancing, and cute characters.  Story is blah for adults - but it is a G rated movie.  My 5 kids (ages 6, 5, 4, 3,  and 1) loved it - the babysitters loved it - I loved it.  Don't be dissuaded by adults seeking complicated/new/intriguing story lines. This is your basic entertaining children's movie. No one was scared or had nightmares or cried or had to leave the theater.  It was a huge hit with my family!
B006ON41FC|1.0|You can not even delete the feint folder that it puts on your phone. It comes right back when you delete it. I do not need 2 MB of files from feint on my phone! If I opted out, it still puts the 2 MB file that steals data on the phone. What good is being able to opt out of feint when it still loads the software on the phone and steals your data? The only benefit of opting out is that your scores are not posted to the net. But it still is able to steal your data off your phone because the folder called feint is still put back every time you start up the app, even if you delete the folder. I will not accept this data miner of an app on my phone whether or not I can opt in or out. Feint needs to leave the app totally for it to not be able to steal your data!  SAY NO TO FEINT!
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|I just finished watching this movie and all I can say is WTF! This movie is almost two and a half hours of hogwash. A best movie nomination? Give me a break. Grace and nature as the themes. Well, I don't think so. The poppy fields at the end are really a clue. This movie is on drugs, or I guess you would have to be to make any sense out of it. Don't waste your time or your money. I don't mind a movie that makes you think, but all this movie did was made me think of drugs, just so I could get through it. This director tried to be artistic and avant-garde, and yes, there is some nice imagery in the film and cinematography, but that alone cannot carry the weight of a movie and this movie misses its mark by a long shot. It's supposed to be teaching a lesson about life, faith and spirituality I suppose, but is far too fragmented to reach that goal. There were never any kind of conclusions or resolutions, and even stars like Brad Pitt and Sean Penn could not rescue this film from its abysmal failings to bring about its points.<br /><br />I am a professional writer and publisher: [[ASIN:0963549936 S.O.S. ~ Songs Of Sobriety ~ A Personal Journey Of Recovery]]
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Iwanted a Bible app that I could read, in my favorite version while listening to so<br />done read it to me.  This Youversion Bible does that, and does it well.  My pastor also uses this app.  Highly recommend.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Here's a problem with the review process at Amazon. I have just looked at the pictures, but havent even downloaded the app. Since you cant delete an app from your Amazon acct, I didnt want to deal with this app being left in apps page. the best part is that i can review this app without even trying it. I can say &quot; 1 star because its got poor graphics or isnt a fun game&quot;, That poor review is not fair to those who are looking for a game about a Crazy Flying Squirel and see more poor reviews than good ones from those who have actually enjoyed the game. I usually go to the Market to check reviews because I cant trust the ones here. There you have to atleast go through the process of downloading and installing before you can rate it. I really dont think Amazon cares if you complain that there are too many kids apps or silly games, they are gonna FAOTD whatever they want anyway. I would love a great productivity tool every day, but I understand that this is a business and many small companies are allowing their product to be free for a day to gain word of mouth, someone actually trying their product and/or actually giving it a fair review. If youve spent many hours or months creating a product that you honestly think is good enough for people to find enjoyable or useful. so think about if it was your product and can make or break your career and even take food off your plate. I dont like to say it's not &quot;Fair&quot;, it's actually not &quot;Right&quot;. Do the RIGHT thing. I think i rambled on too long. Gonna take sick a$$ back to bed. Thanks and have a great day.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is a great game for the price you pay! Which is nothing! I enjoy it as well as any other solitaire game I have played and better than some I have played.
B000HF6ZR0|1.0|I watched most of this movie but couldn't stick it out to the end.  Typical Prime movie which means not very good if it's been released in the last several years. I like science fiction.  This movie is science absurd.
B00005JNEW|5.0|I could not love this movie more. I have watched it many times and never get bored. It is a commentary on my football obsessed home state of Texas and the pressure the one town put on these 17 year old kids. The football games are well chorographed and seem very real and hard hitting. The young actors carrying the movide do a superb job as we feel the angst of the pressure they are put under. Billy Bob Thorton is a very convincing coach and does a fine job as well. I won't go into all the great details but I do recommend this as an EXCELLENT sports movie to be seen.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Uninstalled! Shouldn't automatically connect you to open feint. You should have a choice like many other apps to click on the I don't like fun button. That and the game isn't that great.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|This game is EXTREMELY FUN, but it deletes ALL your progress constantly. I would give it 5 stars, but it is so annoying. I got really far, then its gone
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game.You will have to earn more points or coins to get new games.The games are really fun.You can also choose to get free coins or pay for the coins.The free coins,you will have to download other games for the free coins.Other than that,it is really fun!
0385534639|4.0|Terrific book with a theme that almost makes you think of a LSD-induced inspiration.  The most interesting thing to me was that this is set at the turn of the century and would not work today.  Too many cell phones with video, unrelenting media and FBI investigations.  However, in its time it is pretty cool.  The \\"magic\\" makes me think of the days of Merlin and even back to Moses in front of Pharoh - is it real, or is it magic?  The \\"mystery\\" of the man in the grey suit and his opponent and how they manipulate the young protagonists was somewhat bothersome in the beginning, but partially solved toward the end.  I would have liked to see a completion of the circus because we know it is inevitable but that's only because I detest books and movies that end in the middle of the story (think \\"The Road\\") - it's my hangup.  Well worth the time to read and while it's not a heavy tome, it does make you pay attention.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|syncing in particular is a wonderful feature, though if there's a way to store notes locally (there is such a feature on the iPhone version), I haven't found it yet. I'm sure I'm missing something,  though.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|Great show. Endlessly funny. Perfect lyrics. Joss Whedon should always do musicals.<br /><br />Great surprise: the commentary is also musical!!!<br /><br />I am so happy with this. Watched it tonight and am already planning on getting together with friends next week and watching it again! Perfect party entertainment
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is an extremely fun game, kind of like temple run in a squirrely way. Get it now while it's free.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Not Bad At All. I Can Play A Lots Game But Didn't Tell Me How... maybe You Have To Find Out How. Tricky. Well... 10 Stars For This App. Not Baaaaaad At All!
0316017930|5.0|An impressive perspective on success. Malcolm Gladwell manages to capture in this book the essence and foundations of a person's \\"perceived\\" success.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Cutest and best tetris like game I've seen on any platform. Gameplay is perfect on Kindle Fire.  Not even fair to call it Ferris like, but if you liked Ferris you'll love it. Mesmerizes 40 yo's and 3 yo's alike!  Love the pieces communicating with you. Liking where you put them and being scared if you are going to drop something heavy on them.
6301969251|5.0|20 words can not describe this dvd because my wife really enjoyed it so much it now has become a part of her library
014241493X|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Going into Paper Towns is like diving into your absolute favorite food, only to discover that it is entirely different from what you expected. But it's still really good.<br /><br />See, the thing is, I loved Looking for Alaska and I adored Will Grayson, Will Grayson. So much so, that I think I expected Paper Towns to give me that same feeling right from the get-go, but it didn't. I was into it, I really liked Quentin, and the idea of Margo Roth Spiegelman being such an enigma - or, as John Green likes to call beings such as her, a manic pixie dream girl. And the quirky dialogue between the two was fantabulous (I realize this isn't a word, but it fits the situation).  But after Quentin and Margo's one magnificent, adventurous night, I found myself hating Margo.<br /><br />I think that's expected. And maybe even encouraged. Because, let's face it, Margo is not really all that great of a person. She's selfish and self-centered, but she's a manic pixie dream girl, so it's okay. Quentin, on the other hand, is everything Margo isn't. Where she's wild and uncontrollable, he's kind of boring and predictable, but he's loyal and thinks before he acts. He's also devoted to Margo in ways that don't even make sense to him.<br /><br />The push and pull, tension-filled relationship of Quentin and Margo drives the novel, only because Quentin refuses to let the girl go. Even when the girl goes...literally. The plot is based on human nature and the images we push onto others. Margo Roth Spiegelman is an enigma because her peers make her one. She coins the term paper town to describe the boring Florida suburb she lives in. She says the place has no substance, no dimension, thus, it is made of paper. And I think that kind of explains her too because everyone creates this image of her being this or that, but deep down, she's none of those things. She's a paper girl.<br /><br />Getting from Margo Roth Spiegelman, the enigma, to Margo Roth Spiegelman, the normal girl, is quite the journey, for both Quentin and the reader. John Green has a natural talent for spinning tales that are so compellingly realistic that they tug at every single heartstring the body has, while making us smile at the same time. By the end of the book, I loved Quentin, I loved his friends Radar and Ben, I loved his sorta clueless parents who think he enjoys driving his mom's mini-van, I loved the idea of people being comprised of only so many strings and once they're all cut, we're done for, and I even came to care for Margo.<br /><br />Paper Towns will take the reader on an adventure without a true destination or endpoint. It's a roadtrip without the map, but getting there and figuring out the mystery is the reason why it's so fun. John Green fans will delight in this novel, thrive on the characters, and devour every single page. This book is just another reason why I look at John Green as a literary god. The man can do no wrong!eader.

B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is similar to the game jetpack. on the ipad.I love this game Cu's the missions keep u busy and can be very challenging and the graphics are amazing u will not wanna put this game down I garentee u haha
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great way to keep the kids entertained. Kid friendly and fun. I didn't mind hearing &quot;can I play your games?&quot;
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is a must play!!! I can't seem to stop playing. Going Nuts is a fantastic phone game app.
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|Ok, so this wasn't the most intense and thoughtful story ever, but I didn't go to the movies EXPECTING more than a fun kind of entertainment. I went to the movies to come out happy! And this made me happy :)  I like the morals surrounding the story. I also like the little story lines that come together at the end. It puts things in to simple terms for a young person watching it and gives them a sense of how much their little actions affect the wider population! I may make people scoff at what I've just said, but you can't look at this movie as something more than simple! I liked the music, and I liked the one-liners coming from Will and Bill, and Ramon.  Overall, I would suggest this is a fun movie. Its worth watching for those who don't mind something relatively short and easy-going :)
B0055S348W|5.0|I highly recommend this easy to use application!! It allows your phone to print on any open WiFi network any time. What more do you need??
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game. it may be a little complicated at first but then you get the hang of it.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|This is a good Christmas music record.  I love Zooey's heartwarming singing, and that \\"retro\\" sound M. Ward gives his records. It would be a must-have if you like the other She & Him records.  I love She & Him, so my judgement is swayed.  A Christmas record is fine, but here's hoping that there will be another album of original songs from this great duo this year!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this  game my cousins fight over my kindle just to play I think the squiarrl is soooo cute get this app
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun game there's a music on/off button and sound on/off button WHEN YOU PAUSE WHILE PLAYING. overall its a fun game. played on kindle fire.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really enjoy the integration with my phone I have started to take notes all the time from music to things that I need to get done.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps out there. Its seriously so much fun!  I definitely recommend to get this game. You'll love it!!
B000067FP8|4.0|Although this film may not be as good as the first one it is still a childhood favorite of mine. It is nice to see the original actors return after 6 years and the humor and horror mix is perfect. The gremlins may not be CG but the effects hold up pretty well. If you liked the first one than I recommend this one as well.
B0001I55OC|5.0|I ordered this movie after seeing it years ago. Received it very quickly and love the part where the one character realizes his destiny and truly comes alive. It really makes the movie come together quite well.
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|This is, hands down, one of the best superhero movies ever. The film is written, directed, and acted flawlessly which is something one does not see very often in today's superhero films or movies in general. It is very atmospheric and action packed. Highly recommend.
1600597963|5.0|This is a wonderful next step to Jamie's other book, \\"Beading with Cabochons\\" and Sherry Serafini's work as well, and took me to the next level of bead embroidery techniques. The instructions are simple, clear, and her techniques are creative and beautiful.  I don't recommend this for a beginner because it's really geared toward those who have already worked with bead embroidery at least a little bit.  With all that said, the projects were not enticing to me in the least, but it doesn't matter because the photos throughout the book are enough to stimulate the imagination.
B006ON41FC|5.0|A little slow moving at times, but overall a fun and very addicting games. Very impressive graphics. Who cares if it uses OpenFeint? It's not a total deal breaker for me. The game is still fun. And an option to turn off music/sound would be lovely.
B00505470O|1.0|Imagine being the girl, or the guy in the picture. Now after you clean yourself up, reality creeps in to remind you this is only a fantasy. So is the thought of any good music to be found here: only a fantasy. Enjoy the cover. It's the only good thing about this album.
0767819462|5.0|Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon are great in this movie. To me this is truly an award winning movie. It truly pulls at your heart strings. It is a movie about love, friendship, letting go, moving on, death and acceptance. I could watch this movie any time...I have no doubt that you will love this movie.
0425241505|4.0|Pia Giovanni is in trouble.  Big, scaly trouble.  As a half-breed Wyr, she has a few small talents and a lot of very big secrets, and when her ex-boyfriend blackmails her, she is forced to steal from Dragos Cuelebre, a real, honest-to-god dragon, and the leader of Wyr-kind.  In all his millennia of life, no one has stolen from Dragos and gotten away with it.  After someone breaks into his carefully hidden and protected horde, he's out for blood--until he meets Pia.  Instead of lusting for her death, he starts lusting after HER.  Now they just need to find the very dangerous man who actually hired Pia and figure out what to do about his evil plot and their growing attraction.<br /><br />This book is really good.  The world was familiar, but unique enough that it didn't feel like a retread of every other PNR or UF world out there.  Like in Nalini Singh's Guild Hunter series, the United States (and presumably the world) is divided up in several large territories that are ruled by differed factions of the Elder Races--Wyr, elves, Light and Dak Fae, and a few others we haven't met yet.  I really enjoyed the new spin on shapeshifters--or Wyr as Harrison calls them.  The really old ones, like Dragos and his sentinels, are all as old as time, literally.  Dragos was born with the Big Bang, and lived as a dragon for millennia, until he taught himself to shift into human form.  These men are all apex predators, and no matter their shape, it's impossible to forget that fact.  Pia, on the other hand, is not a predator; even in her human form she's a vegan.  (Though she does eat Twizzlers, and I'm fairly certain those contain gelatin, which is an animal product, but that's a nitpick.)  I won't spoil her actual form for you, because that secret is relatively integral to the plot, but if you're like me, you'll figure it out before Dragos.<br /><br />Both main characters were very well-done.  Pia is absolutely hilarious, both in what she thinks, and what she actually says to Dragos.That is a huge part of her charm in his eyes--he says early on that with her, for the first time in centuries, he isn't bored.  She is a strong woman, but underneath, she's vulnerable.  Dragos is the ultimate alpha hero.  He is unfathomably old and powerful, and genuinely doesn't understand things like saying \\"please.\\"  His possessiveness knows no bounds, and he has to force himself to let Pia have some autonomy.  In a lot of respects, he is similar to Raphael from the Guild Hunter series, though he's not nearly so... dark.  Their interactions are immensely entertaining, and as they start to fall for each other, extremely satisfying.<br /><br />The secondary characters are fabulous.  Thistle \\"Tricks\\" Periwinkle--the heroine of the next book, yay!--is my favorite.  The scene where Tricks and Pia get wasted at lunch is classic, and I really liked Dragos' four griffin sentinels, especially Graydon.  The plot came secondary to the characters for me, but even so, it was well-done.  The villain was suitably villainy, and the climax was really enjoyable.  It could have been a little deus ex machine in the hands of a lesser author, but Harrison had dropped enough clues that it all fit together well.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great start to what looks to be a really good paranormal series.  A solid four stars, and I'll be picking up book two, [[ASIN:0425242668 Storm's Heart (A Novel of the Elder Races)]], ASAP.<br /><br />4/5 stars.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this free game is very entertaining. but the only reason I wrote this.was to keep the freaking rate me thing will go away!!#

B0054JZC6E|5.0|its entertaining and you can unlock and choose your games. that's fun right. ummm. ugh i need 5 more words. YOUR NOT GONNA BELIVE THIS! that should do it.
1401225756|3.0|I'm new to the Sandman story and I found this book interesting but not really that great. I felt that it was a bit underdone. That being said, I will continue to read the series and look forward to getting my hands on book no 2
0553582038|1.0|What a disappointment! Every chapter starting with \\"Cersei\\" made me put the book down. Book four took about four times longer than any of the other books to read because it kept being boring. We could basically have skipped this book and given each of these minor characters 1/4 of a chapter recap on what they did during what the cool people did.  Of course, book 2 and 3 spent most of the time NOT telling me about what I wanted to read anyway, and just giving the POVs of the minor characters. Honestly GRRM is coming around to be \\"the great new pretender\\". Book 1 was great, book 2 and 3 have only been losing steam (I thought book three was building, but if it doesn't build to anything then it didn't), book 4 is a flop, and really now all momentum is DEAD if book 5 is going to flashback to what the cool people have been up to.  I haven't read book 5 yet, of course, but at the end of 4 GRRM sounds like he's saying book 5 is a re-telling of 4 in the cool people POV, which is super annoying, but if it's not, it means he skipped the cool people stuff for an ENTIRE BOOK and is going to tell us about it later. Either way, disappointment.  I'm drawing parallels to me putting down the Wheel of Time forever halfway through book 12 after not being able to slog through the long-awaited recap of what happened in the previous book (I think it was 12, been a long time now).  Why do so many epic fantasies have trouble finishing the job? It seems like the authors can't handle closing the story and with book 5 taking 6 years, and GRRM being 63 I don't really trust him to end this properly. I plan to put this series on hold indefinitely AT LEAST until he writes the official final book, and I hear good things about it.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|I do not buy albums often.  I find Gregory Porter the best male jazz vocalist in years.  The lyrics to his songs are as mature as his voice.  This is a Fabulous album, Thank you Gregory Porter! I can't wait to see you in person someday soon!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the perfect amount of challenge &amp; ease for me. the games are on a simple premise but that they are thumb games / touch screen increases the difficultly for me. I love the novelty of it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun app. if you don't like open feint read the tips on the main screen. it tells you how to turn it off.
B001EYU1VO|2.0|After just one month of using this stick,the left top button broke. It is cheaply made to say the least. It is a fun toy but not worth the price. I have a Logitech stick that has outlasted this one by ten times over.
B006ON41FC|5.0|so awesome! I wish I could play this all day long because it is sooooooo awesome that's y I wish I could play all day.  get this app!
0393075966|5.0|Great book, cogently argued and very readable. If you're looking for a book that is capable of analyzing what went wrong and what to do about it without overloading your brain with technicalities, this is it. A masterpiece.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is amazing I love it I downloaded and I have been playing it ever since I downloaded. this game is fun if u like the game temple run.
B000YDE4AU|5.0|These boots are quality from top to bottom. I read the other reviews and did not heed the advice that they ran big, so I write this review to confirm those reviews. I have always been a 13 and these were definitely big by at least a 1/2 size. The boots are great. The price is great. Save yourself the hassle of returning them and buy at least a 1/2 size smaller.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting. It is better than Angry Birds. I love it. I can not stop playing it.
B005T87QCI|4.0|All this game needs is 4 things:Atom and Zeus,WRB map, taunts,and that you could make your own robot,but overall,it's pretty fun.
0679805273|5.0|This book applied to everyday life for both grown adults and children.  It's such a sweet and insightful little book.  I bought it recently for a friend of mine who recently divorced and is moving on with her life.  Everyone loves this book :)  See the reviews!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|If you are looking for a simple and plain cover then this one works. I have had it for several weeks and it works great. The Kindle snaps right in and you are ready to go. The flap covering the screen naturally falls into place. I love it. It has already saved me in that I splashed some coffee on it and it protected the device. I have not dropped it yet (nor do I want to!) so I'm not able to say how it handles impact but overall I'm very happy with it.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I LOVE this show. Started watching it on Netflix streaming, then joined Season 2 on PBS Internet streaming and Finally joined regular PBS broadcasts on Season 2 Episode 3.  Saw these available, ordered them, and got them in time to see the last episode (Christmas Special) five days early. LOL.  Have not had a chance to go back through them to see if these PBS releases of the \\"Original UK Editions\\" contain the footage missing from the PBS US broadcasts.....I hope they do. Overall the picture and sound quality is excellent though not what I had expected for a Blu-Ray. Video resolution is \\"only\\" 1080i, and the audio is stereo. I would suppose this was because that's how the original production was made and broadcast.  Looking forward to Season Three.......
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I use OSP on my tablet &amp; phone. It is excellent! And best of all it works with SwiftKey X keyboard.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I was looking for one that gave me choices in what layout I used. This is the best I found.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I work in a grocery store and this app makes me happy. Ive been playing it for hours since downloading. I love the silly faces the groceries make.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Might get better review when openfeint is an option and not manditory.  Hate openfeint!  Unfortunate, because this game looked like fun.  Please fix this.  As many of us have written, we'd give it a chance if this was changed!  Until then, it is removed from my device permanently.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I think that this app is wonderful. I have only had it for about 15 minutes and I am already in love with it. Great application
0307949508|5.0|Another fascinating read. I'm not normally a reader of crime novels but this is so different, with fascinating characters, that once again I couldn't put it down. In fact, I had to get the third book of the trilogy so I could start it the second I finished this one!
B004XZ99LO|5.0|I really enjoy Cirque du Soleil performances. I have watched many live performances in Las Vegas and even returned to watch some of the shows more than once. This performance was very good but I wished that it had lasted longer. The 3D effects were very good and made the DVD special.  It would be great to see more DVDs from Cirque Du Soleil in the 3D Blu-Ray format.
0307949486|5.0|I couldn't put it down; I couldn't do anything but read this incredible book!<br />and then I had to run out and the get the next one!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I have seen Phantom performed live on stage 4 different times. This DVD provides the viewer with a very up close and personal experience. The costumes, the performers, the sets are all first class. The camera work was excellent. The views up close were better than you might experience while in the best seats in the theater. The view of the stage through the chandelier was special.  It was fun to see the actors that played the Phantom over the last 25 years was a special treat.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.  THE ACTING WAS TERRIBLE.  THE SOUNDTRACK WAS THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE MOVIE AND THE PLOT WAS TERRIBLE.  THEY TRIED AND FAILED.
0307346617|4.0|Why read: Touted as a must-read for any zombie fan<br /><br />What impressed me: World War Z covers the zombie apocalypse from every angle. Its format allows for multiple viewpoints from all over the world throughout the entire ordeal. The book went into detail about everything from Patient Zero until the very end of the war against the zombies. It felt realistic and possible, leaving little room for doubt as to how things happened exactly because of the matter-of-fact way all the information is presented.<br /><br />What disappointed me: The format that made the book so great in scope makes it almost impossible to become emotionally attached to any one character. The informative reports in the book are purposely presented this way coming across as solely educational and are effective, but I really missed the emotions and tension zombie novels can generate.<br /><br />Recommended: Yes. While I didn't find World War Z to be the best zombie novel ever written, it is definitely a worthwhile read.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is fly fun when u know how to do the controls. Everything in the store for ur squirrel is very useful and cool. I recommend this app for everyone. ; ]
B006ON41FC|1.0|I really wanted this game....but not even worth downloading if its auto open fient....why is there always something negitive with the interesting games?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app! helps me stay in the Word and is so easy and convenient. I love this app. the only thing that would make it better is if they had a free Bible to download.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Help - A very moving movie. It portrays real life in the south and how it affected lives of women then and now.  A must see!!!!  A great purchase price from Amazon.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool games having a lot of fun playing from my amazon kindle fire the touch games are awesome I'll reccomend it to anyone to play there are a lot of games to choose from.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|The seller is honest in their description of the Mini Adjustable Tripod+camera Holder for Iphone.  Both pieces are lightweight and junky, but they did not claim anything more.  The tripod is \\"more junky\\" (less good?) than the camera holder, but neither pieces is good enough to be sure to hold my expensive iPhone.  I would have accepted using the camera holder with iPhone 4, but the holder will not grip iPhone in portrait orientation -- it holds in landscape OK.  But the grip is not strong enough to hold the phone strongly enough after swiveling the tripod head into portrait orientation.  I returned it to Amazon, and replaced it with the Joby GorillaPod with Belkin LiveAction Camera Grip.  That solution is far more expensive than this Mini Adjustable Tripod+camera Holder for Iphone...  but YGWYPF -- you do get what you pay for.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good game for passing time with. Some of the games are a bit tricky at first but once ya get the hang of it they're pretty easy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|keeps the kids busy as there is a little of something for each of them. great while waiting for the school bus.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Sick of people hating on games just because of openfeint. Has nothing to do with the game itself, people should grow up..
B006ON41FC|5.0|And openfeint is pretty cool when u have it on a game that u are completely addicted to. I can compare scores with other people that might be completely obsessed with said game.  Openfeint baby! :)
B0061QD82E|5.0|We have watched \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" over and over and over!!! So glad some of the good oldies are now being made available in the newer format, so our grandchildren will be able to enjoy them as well.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I read [[ASIN:1582406197 The Walking Dead, Book 1 (Bk. 1)]] when it came out, and when I saw that there was going to be a TV version of this beloved graphic novel. I was in.<br /><br />I was especially happy that AMC was taking this project on, because I love Mad Men, and I have appreciated Breaking Bad from afar (I did watch the first 4 episodes and plan on watching more). To top things off the writer Robert Kirkman, Frank Darabont, Mike Nicotero ,and Gale Anne Hurd were on board.Im a huge fan of all of them. A show like this HAS to have a good cast. The graphic novels are so well loved, and the characters so significant, that to not honor them would be a tragedy. For the most part the cast is a dream there is but one stinker in the bunch (im looking at you Sarah Wayne Callies).<br /><br />A show that follows a book/novel/comic cannot just stick to the original story line like glue, you have to veer off at some point and make new paths. The smart fans will understand that, the fans with half a brain eaten wont. I happen to love where they take this season, what they added and what they took away. It made perfect sense to me.<br /><br />The makeup ...oh the special effects! I couldnt have asked for better Walkers (they are never called zombies...i love that) from the \\"hero\\" dead, to the glimpsed and shot dead, its all a giant bloody rotten orgasm to my eyes. This show made even non undead lovers, a fan of the genre. I mean who hasnt watched a Romero movie and just wanted it to keep on and on and on!!! I hope this show lasts a while, its one of the best dramas put forth in years.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great game, with many selections of design for both card and table, as well as choices of game play and scoring.  I don't like the pop up ads between games that try to make me switch settings, or buy some &quot;improvement&quot; to it.  Thanks for asking.
B006ON41FC|1.0|No thank you. Not only does this game force you to use open feint, but there is no way to turn off the sound. I'm with other reviewers, stay away from this app!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|After a first listen, I really like this CD.  The arrangements and instrumentation are excellent fist off... top notch.  The songs are great, many chords, with great melody lines... classic but new to my ears.  Will be listening to these tracks to try figure out these tunes... they are not simple.  Paul does a great job singing and sounds great to me.  I was a little scared when I put this on that it would be schmaltzy but it exactly the opposite,  Kisses is a very Tight, clean, rich delivery of some very amazing songs, delivered with the heart and soul they deserve :-) ......  John would definitely approve and would have whistled for Paul on a track or two.  Be proud Paul... watch this one climb the charts... excellent!
B002BWP49C|5.0|This DvD arrived exactly when promised and in the condition stated by the Amazon Seller.  I was sssoooo excited to have this, I even watched the other three movies in the days before it arrived just so I would have the movie version (we all know movie differs from book) of the Saga fresh in my mind.  It's a great movie, I was rivited to the screen just like I was at the theater last November.  There were even a couple parts that I didn't remember but that's because we never catch everything the first viewing.  This DvD will have much use in my house... I'm one of those that will watch a movie time and again until I have it practically memorized and then take a break for a few weeks before I do it again!!  At some point I will watch Disc2 'The Making Of' which I always find fascinating and informative, but I have to get my fill of the movie first.  'The Making Of' is always a treat, it's great to be able to see and hear about things from the actors & directors point of view.  I am SO happy to add this to my Twilight Collection and definitely cannot wait until November for Part2!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|love it.  if i do you will too.you need to try.  TO DIE FOR !!!!!!!  you will go nuts!!!!!!  BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Very fun and quite addictive.  Hard to write review on a Kindle and they reward for giving 5 stars.  Still, it is a great game and I highly recommend it.
B006ON41FC|2.0|Great game I played it all week and had fun but with? Feint is retarded so why give it a chance in this game at all?
0385535139|5.0|A different and fun new style from Grisham.  Yes, it's lawyer related, as always, but there's wonderful character development (and some are real characters!), plus humor and always a lerning curve as the legal cases develop.  The tort system is shown in its shady, greedy side but the good guys prevail!  Hurray!  Hope there's more stories like this one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a really great game, that is fun for all ages! The only problem I have, oz that it takes forever to get enough coins to buy a new game. Tetious, but fun. A great time waster,too.
0385342063|5.0|I've been a fan of Sophie Kinsella for eight years now (which yes, makes me feel a tad bit old when I say that) since I found the glossy paperback cover of Shopaholic Ties The Knot on the shelve of the supermarket. Six Shopaholics later and several other books, including books under her real name, Madeleine Wickham, I have most likely found my favorite of all of them. Okay, maybe second favorite, I still really love Can You Keep A Secret.  Kinsella has seamlessly blended a breezy, fast, romantic read in I've Got Your Number, all surrounded by one troubled girl, and her newly acquired phone. Poppy Wyatt has lost, arguably the most important thing to a bride just 10 days before her shotgun wedding - her engagement ring. And it's not just an engagement ring, oh no, it's a priceless, family heirloom. What's  a girl to do? As she steps outside the hotel to receive a text, hopefully saying the ring has been found, someone races by, stealing her phone, leaving her ring-less, and now phone-less. In complete shock, Poppy finds a glimmer of hope in the trash bin, where she finds a perfectly good phone just laying inside it. Desperate, she takes it as her new phone, claiming it's \\"finders keepers.\\" But there's just one problem, important businessman, Sam Roxton doesn't see it the same way. Not only does he want the phone back, he certainly doesn't appreciate Poppy wading into his work and personal life.  What ensues is a hilarious turn of events as Poppy and Sam continually upend each other's lives through emails and text messages. From cheating at Scrabble, to signing Sam up for a trip to Guatemala, and even a fun run, complete in Superman costume, Poppy choppily tries to \\"better\\" Sam's life while also finalize her own wedding preparation. But through all of it, Poppy soon realizes she's in for the biggest surprise of all.  I found this to be a hilarious fast read, quite like Kinsella's other books, yet also, surprisingly different. Unlike many others, where the heroine is ina miserable high-end corporate job she neither understands or wants, Poppy Wyatt is a happy physiotherapist. The crazy antics reminiscent of Emma Corigan (Can You Keep A Secret) and Becky Brandon, née Bloomwood, (Shopaholic) are still there, and Sam greatly resembles the best of Luke Brandon and Jack Harper, but the fundamental story line has been changed, which makes this a refreshing book! I especially loved each footnote that was added to the book, most of which made me bust out laughing as I happily flipped back and forth to see what comment would follow her remarks on Toy Story 3 (weepfest), Up (total weepfest) and Finding Nemo (what kind of movie starts with a mother fish and all her little glowy eggs being eaten by a shark, FFS? It's supposed to be for children).  Go get it, you won't be disappointed!
B00004CXMW|1.0|I received this product and could not use it due to it coming from the UK, when I tried to watch it stated that I woould not be able to view because it was not of this region.  I am very disappointed about this.  If they were sending it from the UK to the US seems like they would have known wheter the product was able to view.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was absolutely captivating!  I read it in less than 24 hours, and the only reason it took so long is because I have motherly responsibilities... ha!  Suzanne Collins did a great job of immediately sucking me into the story, and I found myself surprised at the twists and turns more than once.  I generally steer away from anything that reeks of pop culture, and with the movie coming out in a few weeks, I really didn't want to read it.  However, a friend from high school recommended it, and after surviving two years of AP English together {over a decade ago!}, I trust her.  Especially after she compared it to [[ASIN:0547424779 The Giver (illustrated; gift edition)]]... Can't wait to read the next two books!
B004RLPTT0|4.0|Sucker Punch is a great movie and the soundtrack, to me, is even better.  I love the job the various artists do on the older songs like \\"These Dreams\\", \\"White Rabbit\\", and \\"We Will Rock You/I Want it All\\".  \\"Army of Me\\" by Bjork is outstanding and I never liked her music at all but this is a true exception.  The songs all start off slow and low then build to their full musicality that makes me want to crank it up.  I never thought I would have liked the movie and with that the soundtrack but I'm happy to be wrong on this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|a great game on the aneroid u have to unlock the other stages but on this one u don't I'm happy :):):):):):):-)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy the voice activated option. I can pray alongside it as if Someone else is praying with me

B005HSG3VK|5.0|i love my cover for my kindle fire. Now my screen is always protected. Great job amazon!!!!Make sure you get a cover to protect yor kindle
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so fun that my doctor says its starting to be an addiction. he says I should get out of the house more often. but anyways, this game rocks!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this holy Bible app!  It's easy to find the books, chapters, and verses.  The audio version is a great added bonus. Truly outstanding Bible!!

B006ON41FC|5.0|its nice despite the openfient its good compared to the other apps this suckish market gives five out of five
B004I744AS|3.0|Has some definitions but not many two worded ones. I need it for school and had nearly none of the words I was looking for.
0553214632|5.0|Before this book there was not much known about the concept of evolution except the Lamarckian discovery of \\"Inheritance of acquired characteristics.\\" It means that as we evolve, some of our organs tends to stop function. For example; human vermiform appendages, back toe of the dog. These are organs that does not work, but in any lethal circumstances, it might even kill us. Charles Darwin came along. He went on 5 year long Beagle Voyage trip where he discovers that all organism produce far more offspring than they really need (Yes, plants and animal in utopian circumstances), variation exists on every organisms (yet, it is a little difficult to demonstrate in little organism), competition of food always remains in the environment, Nature selects the stronger and better individual, In the case of environmental change the one who cannot adapt extinct, struggle for existence.  This book has given this world the whole different dimension of evolution.
B005K2Z5IA|5.0|This is a great thing.  Kindle fits in it perfect so you get no scratches on your kindle.  Closes nice and tight.
B005T87QCI|1.0|Installed application on my droid. When I try to play it comes up with message. \\"The game requires additional data (about 60MB) to run. Would you like to launch the download now?\\"  I click yes and it immediately says \\"Download failed. Do you wish to retry?\\" I click yes and it gives me the same message. There seems to be no way to download the additional data. I'll update this if I find a fix but for now don't waste your money because it doesn't work.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|i expected this movie to be corny or silly or boring, it was none of these things, i only rented it from red box but it is totally worth owning!  loooooovvvvveeedddd it!!!  it was realistic drama and tears and action, go see it!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|...but LOVE this one! These guys did things right &amp; made a super fun game. For an app the graphics are great. (Moron who said it has gamecube like graphics...is that supposed to be a bad thing? Do you even know what you're talking about? Cuz the gamecube is just a step below the wii as far as graphics go, &amp; for a mobile game, gamecube level graphics are definitely NOT a bad thing.)<br /><br />Since today is jump on the open feint bandwagon day, I'll add my 2 cents. I agree open feint should always be optional, but I'm not gonna act like a 2 yr. old &amp; one star an amazing game because of it. Afterall, it's open feint...not spyware or some fishy permission. I will email the developer like a mature human being. That way they have a chance to fix things without their ratings being trashed before they even know people have an issue with it. Sad thing is maybe one out of all of you whiners will actually come edit your review if/when they do update it. So the ratings will stick &amp; sales will go down because you're a bunch of selfish, thoughtless drones.<br /><br />If you're thinking of buying this game when it's no longer faotd, it's well worth 99&cent;. If the open feint thing bothers you, check &amp; see if they've updated it. It's a great game that I hope isn't ruined just because the IQ of most of these sheeple doesn't allow them to think for themselves.<br /><br />Fun game, devs! Hope to see more!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the trilogy... Finished the books in less than a week. Going through withdrawals and may have to read them again.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|lots of fun, esp when u like blowing things up deffinately a must have app, different from all the others and good graphics
0545425115|2.0|Battle Royale is pretty much the same premise as this book, but it was written by a MAN.  So it has a lot more action, a lot more character development, the author goes into the background and psychology of why people participate in actually killing people vs not killing people.  If you're over the age of 12.... just read Battle Royale instead.
B004AKCME8|3.0|First, the animation itself. Technology just keeps getting better, and this is riding the wave. The texture of the owls' feathers, their motion - it all comes together in a beautiful mix.<br /><br />Then there's the story. I found it a comfortable mix of familiar ingredients, many of which recall Star Wars: the Yoda-like mentor, treacherous relative, and plucky band out to save their world from the evil empire. As stories go, it's solid craft, no rough edges, but hardly fine art.<br /><br />I'm not in the target demographic, though. When I saw it, families with kids maybe aged 5-8 predominated in the audience, and the story seemed aimed at them. A couple of moments might have a skittish child on edge, but most of it seemed safe adventure with bloodless conflict and an encouraging moral or two somewhere in the background.<br /><br />Other than casting bats as bad guys (I like the little critters), I found it visually arresting, but otherwise forgettable - unless I find myself entertaining a small child for a rainy weekend.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
0805080120|5.0|This book pulls off the tricky feat of being both erudite and entertaining.  Deutscher's knowledge is both deep and broad, and he draws on many different aspects of language to make his arguments.  Naturally, many of his examples are from English, but he also dips into German, Hebrew, Chinese and many others, and a number of extinct languages as well.  Throughout, he liberally sprinkles anecdotes, legends, humorous examples, ancient and modern history, and more.  In fact, if I had a complaint, it'd be that he veers into corniness a bit too often.  But it's hard to fault him for trying to keep things fun.  The book is perfectly structured, introducing the basic concepts of linguistic study, then discussing destruction, and creation.  The crowning chapter ties everything together to show how all the wondrous structures and nuances of language can arise from these very basic concepts.  Each idea he presents seems minor at first, and makes a great deal of sense.  The real trick is in the way he weaves them together to create startling conclusions.  It is no exaggeration to say I will never think of language in the same way again.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Miyazaki has done it again: created a charming and engaginge animation, one with a spirit all its own. Fans will recognize elements from his earlier efforts, including his passion for biomorphic flying machines (flying through water this time, but still) and strong little girl in the leading role. It also presents something of an eco-fable, with seas rising as they threaten to do in our real, warming world. But, as in Miyazaki's previous films, even familiar elements combine to make a unique story.<br /><br />\\"Ponyo\\" has been likened to Hans Christian Andersen's \\"Little Mermaid,\\" probably by people who remember only the disneyfied version of the story. Yes, the water-girl loves the boy of dry land. This story, however offers a lighter spirit and happier ending than the dour Nordic tale. It also blends in, perhaps, a scrap of \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" and possibly others. That hardly makes this a derivative work, however. The plot as a whole, along with the imagery that carries it, comes across as fresh despite its familiar elements.<br /><br />Although adults can enjoy Miyazaki's animations at many levels, he intends them for kids, too. This time, the target age appears to be five or so, the age of the boy (Sosuke) who costars in this feature. As such, the mood stays lighter than in some of Miyazaki's other films, and there's a big kid-power message as well. His light touch keeps the serious issues from becoming grim, though. This is an entertainment before anything else. Although not as striking as [[ASIN:B00003CXBK Princess Mononoke]] or [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]], it certainly entertains.<br /><br />--wiredweird
B00005CDNK|5.0|\\"The visitors\\" is the last ever album released by Abba, before they called it a day. Although it wasn't a huge hit, it does contain a lot of very good songs.<br />Starting with the opening \\"The visitors\\" (if it wasn't the serious text it would match all their big disco hits from \\"Voulez-vous\\" cd), through beautiful \\"When all is said and done\\" and \\"One of us\\" and closing with a tongue-in-cheek \\"Two for the price of one\\" and touching \\"Slipping through my fingers\\".<br />This version contains also 4 extra tracks, among which \\"The day before you came\\" and \\"Under attack\\" are the most outstanding.<br />Owe to more personal texts the songs sound more mature, got another dimension.<br />A very decent way to say good-bye to all of their fans, \\"The visitors\\" proved that Abba duly became one of the most famous groups ever.<br />For sure it's one of my favourite cd-s.
B004XQO90O|4.0|The premise seems iffy, but I've seen worse: time travel becomes possible, but only a limited sort. Some few people can go back in time to the last eight minutes of another's life. Unfortunately, that includes the event that ended it, so it's hardly a pleasure cruise. Much to no one's surprise, the military takes this technology on as a counter-terrorism tool. It's too late to avert the disaster that already happened, but maybe it contains clues that will help prevent a bigger one. Eight minutes is hardly enough to get started, so Colter Stevens has to take the trip again and again, learning a little more each time, and dying again each time.<br /><br />The action plays well, and plays a little differently in each eight-minute trip (so he can make progress against the terrorist), right to the very end - which contains a pleasant flip. On the whole, this action movie acquits itself much better than lots I can name.<br /><br />So, what's my beef? The name. Obviously, some Lala-lander heard this cool techie term \\"source code\\". He didn't understand what it meant, so assumed that it had no meaning - leaving him free to make one up. I could do that too. Let's let the word \\"scriptwriter\\" refer to a South American turnip, and \\"director\\" be a children's playground toy. See how well that works? Heck, even a movie like Gattaca had the decency to create a new word when they created a new meaning. Outside that one bit of ridiculosity, I really did enjoy this one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters

B001QOGYBI|3.0|This movie gets under way with everything going for it. Star-powered voicing features George Clooney, Merryl Streep's lovely low tones, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and more. Stop animation has made huge strides even in the age of CGI, and can provide some of the most innovative and engaging imagery around. Basing a movie on a Roald Dahl book certainly won't hurt it, either - look what Dahl parentage did for 'James and the Giant Peach', the various Willie Wonkas, and lots of others.<br /><br />So, with all this going for it, the movie just didn't thrill me, and I'm not sure why. The animation, though thoroughly competent, rarely rose above competence - but did so nicely in the \\"digging\\" scenes and in any involving smoke. Characters grated on me, especially Mr. Fox himself, who I found irredeemably self-centered, the kind who tends to reward friends' loyalty with some pretty poor behavior. Also, I'll happily go along with a forestful of critters in educated professions and snappy tailoring. Within that context (and within his sharp-looking leisure suit), Fox's claim to being a wild animal rings false - unless \\"wild\\" means something more like a frat party than like a jungle.<br /><br />So, I kept the characters at arm's length, and the artistry wasn't enough to pull me in. I'm glad I saw it, but I'm in no rush to see it again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is so simple but fun and addicting. its simple gameplay makes it fun and easy to play for any age!
B002T9H2MO|5.0|\\"Moon\\" just entered that long list of movies, including [[ASIN:B00498VS1E Alien]] and [[ASIN:B000BO0LH2 The Island]], in which the Evil Corporation treats human material as a consumable. You won't find bam-pow action in this movie. Instead, this thoughtful movie sneaks up on you and opens its secrets to you one by one.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the movies revelations, since plot drives this movie rather than action or effects. Each new discovery unfolds more of the plot, down to a few lines captured from radio broadcasts at the very end.<br /><br />Although somewhat claustrophobic, \\"Moon\\" carries itself beautifully. It echoes [[ASIN:B004NWPY20 Solaris]] in some ways, but replaces a mysterious external force with an all-too-understandable human one. I recommend this highly.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is classified as being for kids, but it's seriously fun for adults too.  It is definitely challenging enough to keep adults entertained.  I like that they mix up the types of levels too, from basic bagging to crushing products to marathon bagging, etc.  Great game!
B004XNGKBS|5.0|A very handy app for anyone who needs to make quick notes. Especially when you are on the go and don't have paper and writing instrument handy.

0307891372|4.0|This book is packed full of information, and provided you with a fast and easy way to see as little or as much as you want in the way of game hints or puzzle solving.  The down side is the lack of a good index or table of contents.  They authors really dropped the ball on this part.  The table of contents (if you even want to call it that) in the front of the book is sorted by factions with no rhyme or reason that I can come up with the order.  The index in the back of the book does not include any of the items listed in the front of the book but at least it is alphabetical though might night be under the name that you think is should be.  Lots of knowledge and an equal amount time to find it.  Suggest a pad of post-it notes accompany this purchase or as you go through it make your own index.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|I loved this movie because it took place in one of my very favorite locations in the world. The plot was just scary enough for me to enjoy without being disgusted. What an amazing place to hike! I enjoyed every minute of it but wondered if I ever wanted to go back there again while I was watching this movie.  The answer is, yes!
B0072OFM28|3.0|I watched Gods of the Arena, the prequel and Blood and Sand, the first season at least three times each and every time I watched it I learned something new and was more interesting every time I watched it. Also, Andy Whitfield and original cast had a tremedous amount of charisma, the story line was extremely interesting and emotional. We losted Spartacus and Quintus Battiatus in one season-a virtual double whammy. The death of Mr. Whitfield was a huge loss to the world and to this mini series; one that may not be able to be filled.  I wish the new cast a lot of luck, but it is a near impossible act to follow. Therefore, relatively speaking the first several episodes of the the second season are somewhat disappointing, but I am hoping it will get more interesting as it develops and unfolds into the complete story.
B006ON41FC|2.0|Even without open feint, this is a two star app. It's the same thing over and over. You just fly, grab nuts,  try to avoid owls and trees, hit a tree, and start over. Whee!

B004S3MB2U|5.0|The NeoCal App is the only calculator I have ever used across three platforms, starting with the old PALM 2's. Make sure you purchase the version with the needed features as there is a big difference between Financial, Scientific, Lite and Advanced. But BEWARE!!!  You may find AMAZON's DRM suddenly disabling the app! All Amazon says about DRM is \\"periodically the DRM token will be refreshed, more information to be provided later\\". No word about your purchase suddenly being useless until Internet access is available. Where I work wireless internet is not provided so it was a HUGE surprise when the software stopped without explanation except \\"Internet access required\\". I would recommend anyone considering purchase of this software to look to another App store that does not impose such crippling DRM techniques.

B006UG90RM|5.0|First off, this album makes me VERY proud to be a long time Van Halen fan!  There are NO albums being made like THIS anymore... it smokes from start to finish.  As a matter of fact, I don't know of ANY album that finishes this strong.  I have NEVER heard bass/low end like this on a VH album.  There is brotherly unspoken chemistry between the bass and drums along with impeccable timing that makes me still think Eddie laid down some of the bass lines... if Wolfie is playing on the 2nd half of those last few songs... prepare yourselves, we're looking at the second coming of our rock lord and savior EVH.  But as I listen I've noticed that Eddie's guitars are very layered... with lots of overdubbing... which I really like.  Some of the low bass lines fool me.. I think Wolfie is playing along with Eddie on that super drop tuna low e layer... we know how Eddie did this sometimes in the past (Good Enough - Don't Tell Me).  Anyways... I really dig it!  Two VERY Special Songs are Blood and Fire + Big River  (my fur goes up with goosebumps everytime I hear them)  Two Album Gems are As Is + Honeybabysweetiedoll  (dark and sick... fresh unprecedented sound for VH... might be a result of Wolfie's influence)  The Surprise Song is Stay Frosty  (the 2nd half of this song drops my jaw to the ground in utter awe everytime)  The Dark Horse song is  Beats Workin'  (never heard a VH album end this strong... could be one of the best songs on the album)  The two Rockers are China Town + Outta Space  (I am probably going to get a speeding ticket during one of these songs... Outta Space has some of my favorite lyrics to sing along to)  The two coolest underrated Guitar Solos are Tattoo + Trouble with Never  (Eddie is super smooth on these two songs... still flying by the seat of his pants and landing on his feet... great production)  The Classic VH songs are (of course)  She's the Woman + Bullethead  (right out of 1977 with crunchy, brown guitar and new sounds... Bullethead has me shaking myhead and asking how did he make THAT sound)  The Still On the Fence song is You and Your Blues  (not in a bad way, it just hasn't spoken to me yet)  The VHND hit the nail on the head when they posted: \\"28 years after the last full album with David Lee Roth, A Different Kind of Truth is exactly the album Van Halen fans wanted. Selfishly, we don't want Van Halen to evolve, we want them to pick up where they left off. Miraculously, that's almost exactly what they did.\\"  Give it a few listens on a good stereo cranked up to 11, so you can really FEEL the songs in your sternum... and the VH magic will take over... especially during the later parts of each song when Eddie and Alex kick it into overdrive... you won't be disappointed.  Beats workin'.  Startin' up in my feet.  Goes to workin'  on the rest of me.
0756404738|5.0|The book is outstanding.  The characters are well fleshed out and relatable. The descriptions are brief but thorough; not to the point that you presume the author has a severe case of OCD as many fantasy authors seem to possess. I found myself engrossed in the book so much that I refused to put it down while carrying out my normal household activities. I must admit it's hard to cook dinner with a book in one hand.  Though at 993 pages long it's quite a brick, my only problem was that the publisher made him cut it back as much as they did. The two large glaring vacancies in the story are summarized but still leave you feeling like you missed out. Hopefully he'll re-release the book with the missing chapters filled in. Perhaps only in digital form to circumvent his publisher problems.
B006ON41FC|5.0|all the one star reviews are about how you cant opt out of openfienet but who cares?! this is a awesome game that deserves way better reviews there is not a 1 star review that is complaining about the game itself!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I Loved this movie! I watched it with a girlfriend and , yes we had to get the box of tissues out.  This movie reminds us of the importance of priorities in our lives.  God, family and His great commission. Gotta see!

0891419063|4.0|Following December 7, 1941 a lot of young men in this country enlisted in the armed services.  They did so for the best of reasons.  The awful fact is that war is fought by young men.  When the politicians of the world cannot solve problems through diplomacy it is the young men who pay.  Many pay with their young lives.  The generation of young American men who fought in WW II have mostly gone to graveyards.  Many of these men are my heroes.  So many went off to war and never returned.  That is so sad to contemplate.  Pfc E.B. Sledge, a young man from Alabama, enlisted in the USMC and later found himself in some of the ugliest fighting in WW II at the battles at Peleliu and Okinawa.  Sledge does not glorify war.  He tells the ugly truth from the point of view of an enlisted mortar man.  He details the horror of war with his recollections of days spent in fighting holes with all the heat, the rain, the stench (dead bodies and human excrement) and the killing.  Not a pretty picture.  He documents the waste of human life.  He doesn't really comment on strategy (tactics) or the politics of it all.  He just tells the story from the point of view of a Pfc who views and participates in all of the madness of war.  He makes a point of saying that it is the sensitive soul that really suffers.  A sensitive man that gets through a war is forever scarred.  Of course all are scarred in one way or the other.  Pfc Sledge was a survivor.  He did his duty and despite his involvement in heavy fighting with 3/5 of the 1st MarDiv he returned home.  Without medals of valor but he did return home physically intact.  He survived and lived to tell his tale.  It's a tale well worth reading if you have an interest in combat.  We lost so many men in WW II and I salute each and every one of them.  I would especially like to thank and honor two old Marine vets.  Two who were part of the Old Breed.  Two men I had the honor of knowing:  Forrest Ray Kennett and Wallace Reid Potter.  Both were involved in heavy combat (Ray at Tarawa and Wally at Peleliu) but they both made it back home.  Both passed away in May 2009 in their 80s.  Good men.  May God always bless them.

B0067LY4WG|5.0|not that this new creation needs anymore praise, but I just had to say, for all of the devoted L.C. listeners, you will not be disappointed with this one.  I have been a devoted fan for 40 years because there is no one else  like L.C.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|It's difficult to know if \\"Take Shelter\\" was intended as thriller or psychological drama. The climax is not its strongest feature, but it does generate suspense. Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon) lives in a small Ohio town with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and 6-year-old daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart), who is deaf. Curtis works for a sand-mining company, while Samantha stays home with their daughter and sells her handiworks at a flea market on weekends. This affords them a modest home with a big yard and view of the countryside. But Curtis has begun to have disturbing dreams. They always involve a big storm, followed by violence. He becomes preoccupied with refurbishing an old tornado shelter in his back yard. Then he begins to hear and see storms that aren't there while awake. Curtis wonders if he is showing signs of the schizophrenia that afflicted his mother, or having premonitions of an impending disaster.<br /><br />Jeff Nichols wrote and directed \\"Take Shelter\\", inspired by a sense of global anxiety, unease about the future, engendered by the financial crisis. Curtis LaForche is an introverted man of few words who feels strongly the need to protect his family -but from what he is not certain. Michael Shannon does a nice job of showing us Curtis' inner torment, created by his conflicting compulsions to build the storm shelter, to hide his troubles from those around him, and to find out if he might be mentally ill. Wife Samantha is as understanding as she can be and impressively sane once she understands her husband's fears. I admire the complexity and integrity of those two characters. Daughter Hannah, however, would be more frightened by her parents' volatile behavior that she is. But I enjoyed the characters and the uncertainty surrounding Curtis' visions. The only bonus feature on the DVD (Sony 2012) is a theatrical trailer (2 min). Subtitles are available in English, English SDH, and French.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My family and I love this app.  It's not hard to unlock new games, my three year old can even do it.  Really is a lot of fun for the whole family.
B006ON41FC|2.0|resource hog, lacking common settings and sound options. slow to respond on dual processor system. I would hate to test on single processor system.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great timepasser.Ive been looking for an app for just this purpose, to play when boredom strikes. The games are kinds fun, and l love unlocking the games. But the controls can make gameplay extremely difficult, they seem a but touchy. Also the adds are quite intrusive. I understand that this is a free app, but...you get it.

0385344228|5.0|I just finished reading this suspenseful and engrossing novel by William Landay.  I liked it and I was quickly so into it that was unable to put it down and kept reading and reading until I finished it.<br /><br />It was terrifying in that it tells a very realistic story of how anyone's lives can suddenly spin out of control - and our inability as parents to stop it.  This is every parent's worst nightmare.  And, as a parent of two (now grownup adult) children, I certainly can relate to having a couple of legal skirmishes, relating to both my children (much minor than the tale described here)and how it somehow changes your life and your beliefs in your own children and in yourself.<br /><br />I, for one, am an advocate for never giving your children your full trust and blindly discounting warnings that family and friends give you about them, much less the intuitions that you have and what you observe about your children.  You want to believe that your children are not \\"like other children\\", that they are \\"incapable\\" of doing what others do.  And, that belief will yield you a great deal of disappointment in the long run.  Yes, they are capable and do in fact things that you never thought possible.  As the novel suggests, parents most often blame themselves for the shortcomings of their children.  It took me a long time to realize that I taught them well, didn't neglect them or their education - and that at some point, they, and they alone are responsible for their actions, and, as painful as that may be, you need to let them accept and pay for the consequences.  I learned these things the hard way.<br />Let this novel be a warning to all parents of the pain and disappointment your children can bring upon you, whether you deserve it, or not.  Even today, with my children, one in her late 20's and one in his early 30's will lie, deceive me and cheat me out of even the smallest things.  And, I, still at times blame myself and try to justify what they do.  I trust them, but not completely, and certainly I am always vigilant and called them up on whatever offense and no longer allow them to take advantage of my love for them, or take me for granted.<br /><br />Great, engrossing novel - a little repetitious and too winded at times; certainly painful to see the characters go through the tribulations caused by their son Jacob.  A must read for all parents who trust their children implicitly - and a call to all parents to open their eyes wide and accept their children for what they really are:  human beings who often fail to live up to our expectations and their upbringing.certainly I am always vigilant and called them up on whatever offense and no longer allow them to take advantage of my love for them, or take me for granted.

B00005NTN5|3.0|It isn't a B-movie, and the acting is better than I figured it might be. The DVD is just fine, the transfer quality is fine, and the sound is fine. Unless you viewed this on a premium (additional charge) channel, the TV version is going to be missing  part of the video's more complete offering of \\"Bound\\" with Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, Joe Pantoliano, John P. Ryan, and a few others.  It's a film about a crime syndicate and how two women have a love tryst (just the two of them) that leads to plotting how to get away with two million dollars of crime family money.  I would wager the steamy scene used a stunt double for Jennifer Tilly for a couple of seconds.  I'm pretty sure I saw this in 1996 when it first came out, but it was edited for TV when I saw it.  This video isn't edited for TV.  On the other hand, Jennifer Tilly is why 98% of the men who watched this film, went and saw it.  Therefore, if you want to know how much of her you get to see, the film cost 4-1/2 mill to make, and at the end of the showing at theaters 2 months later, the box office gross was still short by $700,000.  Still a worthy crime drama with a little action in there.  Originally the film was rated \\"R\\" for sexuality, violence, and language (don't let the \\"unrated\\" make you think it is something wonderful or something horrible).
B004U52VPS|4.0|It is a neat toy, however it takes forever to set up each item for use.  You have to set up each set before the next person can go and it can take awhile.  It is a neat toy though.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Only played about 3 flights, but it is fun!  Highly recommend this game.  Especially. for those who enjoy controlling an avatar.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover.  It fits my kindle fire perfectly and really makes it look like a book.  If I had any complaint at all it would be that you should offer some type of engraving or embossing on the cover to personalize it but that is not a big deal.  I have shown it to several friends and family and they are all impressed.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Needs ability to disable openfient and disable the music but keep the sound effects. the music gets annoying really quick.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I saw the ratings for this movies and decided to give it a chance. Glad I ordered the Bluray this is an outstanding movie with a lot of emotional power. Loved the behind the scenes stuff!
0553062182|4.0|Very new ideas to me.  Loved the fact the writer is an HSP herself - certainly explains a lot to be sure.  Worth buying
B006ON41FC|1.0|This game was very poorly designed, with no way to.adjust the most basic of features. For example, there is no option to turn off sound. I had to mute my entire device when all I wanted was to turn off the sound. The game apparently has no exit button, either. The only way to leave is once again through your own device's means (the home button). Putting these last two together, it can only be assumed that this game was created by someone truly evil who wants to force you.and everyone around you to listen to that annoying title screen song until the end of time. And then there's Feint. I can't fathom why after becoming the most frequently complained about feature of every game that has it, someone would actually make it mandatory in their game.
0812992792|3.0|For me, the story line jumps around a little too much. The central character is in one place doing crazy things without explanation, usually under orders, then elsewhere without much continuity. After reading non-fiction books about North Korea prior to this one I was disappointed and decided to put it down after going half way through. I may pick it up later to finish but for me it's not really an environment for interesting fiction.
B000FU7ERW|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it!!! I love it!!! It was in great condition!! Would recommend to anyone who collects records or any Zeppelin fan!! I actually wish I had it for myself!!!

1594202842|3.0|If you decide to read this book, just keep a very open mind.  This is a memoir about Amy Chua's struggles and triumphs as a mother.  She wrote in the very beginning of the book that whenever she mention \\"Asian Mom/Parent\\" or \\"Western Mom/Parent\\", she does not mean  ALL Asians or ALL Westerners.  She is a graduate of Harvard Law and is teaching law at Yale.  I am sure she could easily have used other words to describe the different parenting technique if she wanted to.  But book writing is a business and by creating controversy she got a lot of buzz and publicity for the book and herself.  I got curious myself when my lunch dates talked about \\"Tiger Moms\\", so now my Nook also got a copy of this book.  Amy is a very strict mom who demand only excellence from her daughters.  She only wanted the best for them and obviously also have the money to hire the best teachers.  She also have the tenacity and perseverance to not give in but exert control over her kids and what she perceives to be the best for them.  She also explain at the end that some parts of the book are supposed to be taken as jokes.  Personally, parenting is very one of a kind.  Different kids,  different parents,  different moods, different temperaments, different days, heck, even different times of the day will bring out different reactions from me.  Being an immigrant myself, with grandfathers coming from the same Fujian province like Amy's grandparents, I can see and understand what she is trying to say.  But we can not generalized discipline technique by culture alone.  Both my parents grew up with discipline techniques that are way different from each other.  Also I think that there could also be a generational difference.  We also see a lot of Westerners and others who are well behave, high achievers and are excellent at their chosen careers.  How many hours they read and studied or  how they practice piano or violin or if they ever had a sleepover, we will not know unless one of them will write a book about their home life growing up.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|If you are a fan you will want all three albums of Amy's art.  This was the last one I purchased and my less fav, but it is  still great.
B000YJ54DU|1.0|...that someone obviously pretending to be Lee Child wrote this book.  Hopefully he will be back on his game for the next one!  Very, very, poor...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games are boring. There arnt very good instructions either. But it is a good thing to do if you are really board.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Another masterful product from former LA crime reporter.  He really knows the Police procedures and scene and Harry Bosch is just my type of non conventional police Detective.  I have been down in the Mexicali barrios supervising kids on Church trips and it is as dangerous as described.  I was surprised by the ssurprise ending that Harry discovered, never saw this coming but it was fulfilling and actually left Harry with a possible love interest to come in future books.  The only problem that I have seen with Harry's books is his former tunnel rat background.  Harry is described as about 6 feet tall and muscular.  I was in Viet Nam and the only tunnel rats I met were smaller people with guts plus, to go underground in those booby trapped and snake, bug infested holes where the enemy holed up.  Not sure a man of his size would fit that bill but I am nit picking.  I have completed 2 of Harry Bosch books and both were 5++++.  Great read, find yourself going through a hundred pages like no time elapsed.  Highly recommend any of Mr. Connelly's books including the Mickey Hatcher lawyer books, Harry's half brother as it turns out.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I'm only doing this to stop those messages. twenty word minimum. the only fault in the game in my opinion. forcing me to do this to better enjoy the game
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was reccomended to me by a friend. I loved it from the first page. It was very suspenceful, and they threw in many shocks. The only bad thing that I have to say about this book is that it is very violent. I reccomend it for Middle Schoolers to adult.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are fun for the. whole. family. and. get addicting as things cost more so you have to challenge yourself.past just beating the levels
B006UG90RM|5.0|This disc is a dream come true for CVH fans.  Yes, some tracks were reworked from vintage tape.  What a great result that decision yielded!  This is arguably the most listenable VH disc ever.  From song 1 through 13 it's a rocking good time.  Forget Tatoo, that was to get the wives to go to the shows!  The rest of the dics will melt your face off.  Dream come true.
0439023483|5.0|This story was truly life changing. The premise of the story alone is enough for anyone to realize this will not be your run of the mill young adult novel.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta's story is amazing. How two children can be sent to compete against other kids knowing the likelihood of them surviving is minimal at best is enough to make any reader lose their breath. Then the relationship development between these two characters really puts the icing on the cake. The story was so well written, I was literally in tears to the point where I thought I couldn't continue any further, yet I still refused to put the book down. On the flip side, there were moments I was grinning like a Cheshire cat. Therefore, if you don't want people to think you're losing your mind you may want to find a nice quiet room to read in because you may not be able to control your emotions when reading this story.<br /><br />Though both main characters were inspiring to me, Peeta was really the standout character within the story. As the son of a baker, he comes off as one of the most unlikely players to make it through the first few minutes of the hunger games. He may not be the strongest or best with weapons, but he has an inner strength and resolution that really makes you rally behind him.<br /><br />As if creating exciting main characters wasn't enough, the supporting cast Ms. Collins brings in are just as remarkable. For example, Rue and Cinna are two characters I felt could have had their own stories. They had a star quality. I was eagerly anticipating the next scene to include them. These are only two of the wonderful characters that grace the pages and I am sure you will fall in love with each and every one of them.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to numerous people including my daughter. She was captivated to the point that she brought the book to read during lunch and recess in school. While this book may not be appropriate for children under twelve due to its dark themes, it is certainly worth an adult's time to read and then decide whether to share with their child.<br /><br />Originally posted at LAS YA Reviewsread and then decide whether to share with their child.

B006ON41FC|1.0|Funny, most people have given this either five or one stars.  I am one of those people.  Like the others have mentioned being FORCED to endure spyware openfeint is unacceptable to me.  Which is a shame because if you could opt out of it like many other openfeint games, I'd give it a five star review.  The game itself is simple, fun, and easy, but being forced to connect to the internet and having openfeint run with no way to shut it off means that I am going to delete the app.  Shame about that.
B000SQJ2JG|4.0|first impressions is everything. i've heard this once through and don't know the names of all the songs yet but it rocks , it funks a little bit, and just that there's a recording that features the combined peak powers of the bolin/coverdale/hughes/paice/lord incarnation of the purple. one of the things i love is keyboardist jon lord's penchant for using his instrument as a percussion instrument used for rhythmn in tandem with ian paice's power drumming. tommy bolin's guitar goes from disco style(don't stress it,my fellow rock-lovers, it only happens on one song-during that bit u forget it's a deep purple album and maybe think you loaded some Sylvester onto yer mp3 playa by mistake-lol)another song is hard funk style, there's an a song with both coverdale and hughes combining their vocals, and the rest is the more rock oriented stuff. it is a progenitor to the sound coverdale and co. would fine tune in a band called whitesnake. the highlight for me is the last track 'you keep movin' alone is worth the price of admission. best when played in the dark with the headphones on.
B006J420UE|4.0|I had selected the low-power (65W) A8-3800 that AMD announced, but isn't producing in quantity sufficient for Amazon to fill my order.  When I completed a new workstation build and still hadn't received the processor, I selected the high-power consuming (100 W) A8-3870.  I have very happy with the processor and the whole set-up; however, I am disappointed in AMD and their ability to deal with their marketplace in a forth-right business manner.  No notice about availability in over 4 months is unacceptable behavior for a worldwide presence.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Awesome Man Awesome xD Just Awesome Download It Nowww ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! You Really Should Download This Game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game because it has so many different games in it. it gets difficult to earn enough points to buy another game as you get farther into the game so you have to play games you've already beat. overall, I would recommend this game
B002QP145C|4.0|A bit longish, but well done.  Dark, gritty, realistic (based on historical photos of the real Winter War) and kept my attention.  A worthwhile addition to my war flicks collection.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|its okay both the best game ever but it passes timevjjggfggggxjfnchxjxjdjdn fhdjdkd hfhd jdbdkskd hdkdjdjdjdj djdkdjfh now I'm just bored.
B006ON41FC|1.0|When are all these devs going to figure it out that some of us are out of junior high and don't have any use for social media and don't want it tied to our games. Some of us just want a simple game to play without that bs. I will not get any app that has openfeint!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have no complaints from this one, its a great time killer that doesn't really drain the battery! My kids like it too! There is a variety of games to keep you happy!
B006ON41FC|5.0|could make u late for anything... love it spent so long playing I have a finger cramp..lol..a little.slow between stop and start but much fun
B006ON41FC|4.0|Its cool at first but it gets old fast.Maybe if your really good at it ,it might not get old.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Why is everyone complaining about Open Feint???  It's OPTIONAL, people!!!  All you have to do is click on the Open Feint Icon on the main menu, click the menu button at the bottom of the screen, click Settings, then Remove Account.  Pretty simple, people, if you would just read the tips at the beginning of the game!!
B006ON41FC|1.0|I'm with the others. IF you're going to use Open feint, make it optional. Also, seeing the other posts about sound not changeable is a big down side. Am I the only one who plays games while on the crapper? Giving one star to help drive rating down so others won't have to deal with these bothersome lack of features. Fix and I will install and rerate.
B006MQRLSA|5.0|This movie was really good and had a great storyline. They could have done a little better tying it all together at the end but overall it was very entertaining except for the use of two f-words and other language. If you can get over that it is otherwise a very good movie and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good, exciting, \\"Rocky\\" type story.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|HELLO!!  This review is for the YouVersion Bible app!!!!  I clicked on the wrong icon!  So Adobe Reader (which I also like) readers try the YouVersion Bible app -- you just might like it!  This is a great way to be able to read my Bible; I especially like the fact that on my Kindle I can adjust the size of the font; not every version comes in large print (a mistake on the publishers part).  I recommend this app to everyone -- maybe following one of the daily devotional reading plans will start someone reading even more!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I'll keep it short since it's probably all been said before.  But how Ms. Austen can create such dramatic page-turning tension with so little real \\"action\\" is beyond me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First of all this is one of those books where you barely can put it down, so well written it is. I started reading this book 2 days ago and will finish it tonite.  It's well paced, the detailing and descriptions are enough to give substance but not too much to make it boring, the characters are intriguing, and while the book talks about violence and romance, it never gets too much into those aspects that they dominate it.  But most of all the author was able to add a freshness to a theme that is not new per se by combining elements from several other stories, and create contrasting realities between the Capitol and the districts, an explanation of how the Hunger Games operate, and so on.  Life in the districts sound like a Mad Max movie while life in the Capitol seems like one of these sci-fi movies where cities are perfect and everything is easy. The preparation for the Games sounds like one of the celebrity reality shows, but in the future, and the Hunger Games actually come up like a medieval version of the movie The Running Man (with Mr. Schwarzneger) but with technological interferences from the Capitol leaders that include weather changing and mutated animals. And finally, while the combo female author-female teenage main character could sound like a new Twilight series, the only hint from that is the absence of explicit sexuality.  It's definitely not a book to change your life permanently or make you a philosopher, or anything like that. It's just a great read, that will entertain, intrigue and leave you with that sad feeling when it finishes, just like the Millenium trilogy books. Not coincidentally, both were in the best sellers list for several months.
B002BWP49C|3.0|I've been a fan of the Twilight series before the first book was transformed into a movie. The last three movies were really good, my only complaint on any of them was that the pacing for the first was a little slow. But this film, wow. Where to begin??<br /><br />The wedding ceremony is beautiful, and somewhat off beat with the crazy speeches given by friends and family. But before that the 'nightmare' seems off. Also, as someone else has pointed out what happened to the sparkly vampires? Don't get me wrong, I am GLAD they no longer sparkle like beautiful gems, but this was part of the story. Their diamond like, glittery skin was mentioned numerous times through the series and was the soul reason as to why they could never be seen in the daylight.<br /><br />The film felt choppy, and while I did love the chemistry and feeling between Edward and Bella, it was just hard to watch at times. Several scenes felt like a strange trip down the rabbit hole. It was trippy. There's no other way to explain it. I was disappointed in that aspect of the film, and the choppy feel to it. But other than that I did like it.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I bought this cover to protect my kindle fire. It also lets you prop it up for playing games or reading. Has a strap for holding cover closed. Only thing it could use is a place to hook on a stylus.
0143039431|4.0|A massive work about the migration of dispossessed farmers from Dustbowl Oklahoma to California in the 1930s, the story traces one such family, the Joads, as they seek the Promised Land of oranges and cotton, only to realise the truth isn't so simple, and the destination as arduous as the journey.<br /><br />Criticised for its less than in-depth psychological analysis of the characters like Tom Joad and ex-preacher Jim Casey, I however felt that the cinematic vision of the text came through because of the way characters are revealed through what they say and do. Ma Joad, in particular, struck me as an unwaveringly strong character who tries to hold her family together, even as it disintegrates before her eyes.<br /><br />In the interchapters, Steinbeck casts his lens on the larger situation and suffering of these migrants, and makes a sobering social commentary on the state of America and its politics of commerce and capitalism. Some readers have commented on the oppressive view that Steinbeck forces on the reader, but that to me is secondary, because the narrative persuades through both the examination of the micro as well as the macro, and it is a point of view that demands careful gaze.
B006ON41FC|5.0|At first I read the reviews, and I didn't think that this would be and fun, but wow its amazing!!!!!
0439023513|5.0|I waited for this follow-up in the series for a long time and wasn't disappointed. It was a great read with a lot of action and twists and, finally, a resolution between Peeta and Gale. 'Mockingjay' might just be the best book in the trilogy.
B005NK69ZC|5.0|I really liked reading this book. I read it on my kindle and usually read on my lunch breaks at work. I had to stop myself from laughing out loud at each page turning. I had the biggest smile on my face. I would highly recommed reading this book. It is a great read. I love how Ellen can get off topic and just start to talk about other things and forget what she was saying in the first place. Funny, Funny book.
1451627289|4.0|11/22/63 was a joy to read. Compelling and well-written, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the over-infusion of pro-Obama political rhetoric. Aside from that minor distraction, 11/22/63 was an intriguing and thought-provoking book that I highly recommend without hesitation.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Cool little time waster. Fun and gets more difficult. Check it out for yourself and have a little fun, or don't and miss out.
0316010669|5.0|If you've ever wondered why first impressions are so powerful, or how unconscious cues are perpetually influencing conscious perception, \\"Blink\\" is your book. \\"Blink\\" explores the neurological science behind snap-judgments, intuition and our brain's ability to filter and evaluate massive amounts of information in a split-second. But Gladwell expertly puts the science into layman's terms, using everyday examples to explain how we all \\"think without thinking.\\" I read \\"Blink\\" over two years ago, and still find myself regularly noticing and reflecting on the phenomena it discusses in my daily life. \\"Blink\\" is definitely a book you won't soon forget.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It satisfies that solitaire urge nicely. The graphics are good. lord of options for cards and sounds and different types if games and deals.
1451648537|5.0|'Steve Jobs' is a well-written and thoroughly-researched book on the icon, revealing and examining his motivation, his drive, his passion and his vision. It should be mandatory reading for all business and political leaders.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app!  There are so many translations to chose from and you can also listen to many verisions. I would definitely recommend the YouVersion Bible.
0345522478|4.0|This is a rip roaring fun ride. The style and scope of the writing reminds me of Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, and Jim Butcher (Dresden Files).  Puns and laughter abound alongside combat, wit and adrenaline.  One  interesting aspect of the main character is the deepness of his flaws and matching convictions. The Druid is not a hero. He is written as a survivor with a stubborn streak of \\"macho nerd\\" and \\"frat boy party dude\\". I know that's confusing, but read the book. You'll get it. Even if you disagree, its still tons of fun.  Don't expect villains to not be villainous.  Don't expect tricksters to not be tricksters.  The characters of the book don't generally evolve beyond their two dimensional persona. On the other hand, its hard to care. The story moves fast from one adrenaline pumping scene to another.  Read this book.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Wanted was a great movie and the actors did a great job I had watched the movie before and I enjoyed it very much and I look forward to seeing it again! the movie again makes being a member of Amazon.com quite enjoyable!
B006ON41FC|1.0|No option to disable OpenFaint equals to I am not even going to try the game. developers have to stop doing that.
B001F7MSFM|3.0|Hellboy II: The Golden Army was a good but not a great story to purchase in retrospect I would not have bought it had I known how poor it was. I watched it but was not that impressed by the movie itself.
0525423656|3.0|I have to say I was anticipating and excited to read the sequel. I enjoyed the first book a lot. Had a lot of substance despite the cliche love story. However, I found the sequel lacking that substance the first book had. The first half of the book is about finding Ky. There's honestly no suspence or surprises along the way. The only thing it has going for it is the ongoing love between the characters. And once Cassie and Ky are reunited, I found it took a strange boring turn. After finishing it, all I could think of was the fact that all this was, was filler. The characters pretty much end in the same position they were at the end of the first book. The only part that was interesting was the very beginning, the middle where they're reunited and the ending. Everything else just fell flat for me. I hope the third is better.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Van Helsing was a great movie to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it and the actors did a great job and were doing it and I look forward to watching it again a good purchase that makes being a Amazon.com user such a great thrill!
B006ON41FC|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO FUN! MY FRIEND AND I LOVE IT! THE SQUIRREL IS SO CUTE! HAHA ;) IT IS SO FUNNY WHEN YOU GET THE MOLDY ACORN BECAUSE THE SQURREL GETS ALL LOPSIDDY!
B005Q1W10A|4.0|I recommend this item!  This is a very popular British production, bought it for my elderly mother as a birthday gift.  She was thrilled to receive it delivered to her door. Mom loves the series AND can select the subtitles feature so she can really enjoy the show despite being so hard of hearing.
0545425115|1.0|Is there a truly great writer alive today? When you've fed your mind on a heathful diet  of truly spellbinding literature, this imposter of a novel will sicken you. Even my 14 year old son was aghast after only one chapter. Horribly written. Horrible premis. No hero to speak of. And the fact that we are entertaining ourselves with teenage murder makes us just as sick as those in the book watching the events on live tv.  My (adult) friends told me they couldn't put this book down. I cannot read one more rediculous word of it.  Twaddle!!  Don't waste your time!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I watched all 3 version of Persuasion .I thought after watching the 2007 I would enjoy watching the older version of Persuasion (1971 & 1995)too.But i was not impressed.It was kind of boring and shows no special effect how Anne and Frederick feel seeing each other after 8 years. The 2007 version of Persuasion is better.The Actors Anne (Sally Hawkins) and Frederick (Rupert Penry Jones)play the role fantastic.You can feel<br />in every scene how Anne and Frederick feel seeing each other after 8 years .You wanna watch  Persuasion over and over again.I agree its not exactly like the book by Jane Austen,but most movies are not always based on a book.But I still think it is a better version of Persuasion.When you love Persuasion,you will enjoy watching this movie.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I am heeding the warnings from my peers and not downloading this game. Looked at first like a good find for the FAOTD, but forcing openfeint is a no-no. Take the hint, developers, and don't feed us software we don't want.<br /><br />Too bad. Might have been a fun game.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|Didn't like the version of Persuasion.It was boring. You could not feel what Anne and Frederick are going through after seeing each other after 8 years,no emotion or feeling and expression.The 2007 version is better.Its not exactly like the book,but a lot  better and the Actors play the role fantastic.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun little game. Not only could I opt out of openfeint, but it also provided a way to completely remove the openfeint account from my phone (try READING the clear instructions and you won't appear illiterate). Same with sounds. Clicking the music icon to turn the music off and the speaker icon to turn the game sound off seems simple enough to me. Of course, I actually downloaded the game and opened it before typing this review...
B0050SYS5A|1.0|In thoery the Zoom is a great idea, but it just doesn't work, if anything it makes things worse.  A big part of the problem for me is that my height caused issues with the kinect picking me up and I thought the Zoom would help but it does nothing for the vertical, only the horizontal.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like the games.  It's very addicting. Good for past time. Need lots of patience for some of the games.

B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Stunning film! This film had an emotional impact in  our family that really lasted. One of the best in the last year. Deserves much more attention!
B0052U6KJI|5.0|This is my 2nd pair of Merrell Barefoot running shoes. The others I have are \\"Trailgloves\\", the only difference being the canvas material on these is mesh on them. Okay. These are great bare foot running shoes. They will definitely stand the test of time & miles. I ran a half-marathon October 2011 in these. It was a Personal Best for me, 1 hr 44 min. However, I had a painful knot in my right inner shin for sometime afterward. It was directly related to running in these. Even though I trained for 3 months or so in these. It just goes to show that barefoot running requires alot of patience & persistence. I suggest a good compression sock to go with these (if you want to cover alot of mileage in them, like a marathon, or a half even).
B004O7EVLY|5.0|If I write a full review I wouldn't be saying anything the other reviewers haven't already stated. These guys can go from fist pumping rock and roll to bluesy melodic soul with such fluidity it makes me wish I knew other bands that were of Graveyards caliber. This is the best CD I have heard in 10 years and maybe ever heard. Here's to hoping they come out with a third. If you are a fan of Clutch, Black Angels, Black Mountain, Wolf People, B.R.M.C., Black Sabbath or just good rock/blues-- you will love these guys. This album even has a track which sounds like a blues, psychedelic spaghetti western song--it makes me want to watch The Good The Bad and The Ugly and replay Red Dead Redemption again. These guys rock!
B006ON41FC|4.0|well rounded game of collecting and dodging. temp upgrades and expend ive in game currency perminant upgrades. id pay$2 for this game but I boughtwhen it was free.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Simple controls, progressive objectives, easy to learn. Solid game. Only suggestion for the dev's would be to include a setting for tilt control or a combination of the press and tilt to enable tighter turns.
B005D51II0|5.0|As other reviewers note, Decca did it right. Unlike the DG boxes there isn't much dross here, just a couple albums of 'X sings Opera encores'. Given the inevitable bias towards showy orchestral pieces in a collection touting spectacular sound the variety here is impressive and all the selected recordings really are outstanding performances in outstanding sound.
6302820448|1.0|This is one of my favorite movies,i enjoy this movie again and again but i went to take the tape out of the vcr and it broke in half but its okay i simply ordered another and this movie is shipping soon and is a DVD from what i understand,i purchased the previous movie as a used tape i realize it was not new,i donot in anyway blame the seller and will continue to purchase products available to my liking from this seller,my rating is low because i can't see the movie right now but as a whole i would give the highest of ratings for the prompt arrival of my movie,Thanks to the seller and Amazon
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is even better than Temple Run, which is a hard app to beat! No doubt! I mean it is the most fun game I think I ever played!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This was one of my favorite games for a while! I wish they would make another or make this one longer. I completed all the challenges and wish there was more.
B006ON41FC|5.0|The gamelplay is really good. Spend hours of fun playing &quot;Going Nuts&quot;. Just needs better controls over the squirrel. Thanks for the free app.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|If a person has read Angels and Demons and the DaVinci Code he/she has read this book.  The plot line of each book goes something like this -- Robert Langford gets trapped trying to solve a puzzle.  He meets a beautiful intelligent woman.  They spend the rest of the book running around solving the puzzle -- Rome, Paris, England, Washington D.C.  This particular book has an unbelievable deus ex machina concerning Langford someplace in the middle of the book.  It is also full of hokey mumbo jumbo theological speculartion.  The last 100 or so pages are simply theological speculation.  The book is an example of the old saying Ex absurdis sequitur quodlibet (from the absurd anything follows).
B006ON41FC|2.0|very laggy , almost unplayable  on both my captivate and my infuse 4g.  uninstalling for now.  hope it gets an update to become a bit faster in the future.
B006ON41FC|5.0|stars five buy it is good going nuts.I know it's to bad but it is fun to play.I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a really really good game for the kindle fire and you can turn the music off just pause and click the music symbol
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is actually kind of addicting. I love it. graphics are good.  I do wish the steering was like th hungry shark game tho..
B0055SWM08|4.0|I really enjoy this game, and find it extremely addictive and entertaining. However, I keep getting interrupted by the title screen in the middle of gameplay. Fortunately, it puts me back where I left off.
B006ON41FC|3.0|I would have rated this higher if the game hadn't asked me to rate it. That's annoying and unacceptable for a paid app. glad I got it as the faotd.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was an ok app but it was very boring and some of the games were really hard to complete
0307477479|3.0|The Pulitzer Prize winning A Visit From the Goon Squad was a total disappointment. Sure there are some great insights and turns of phrase, but overall the writing feelt too contrived; it kept pulling me out of the story. And don't even get me started about the last two chapters!  The novel weaves together the stories of several characters over time. The plot is loose and often unbelievable (one character works as a publicist for a foreign despot). I suppose there is something to be said about some of the characters--interesting, compelling. Still, it feels lacking and sometimes forced. The last two chapters are pure science fiction--very gimmicky. One chapter is a power point supposedly created by a middle school student. Having worked as a middle school teacher, I can tell you there isn't a middle school student on the planet who could construct such a thing. I never really appreciate anything that is supposed to be from a child's point of view anyway. Hated Room! Egan takes it to a whole 'nother level, though. I'm sure there are those who think that the presentation of time and characters is some magical concoction, but I think that it is pure nonsense presented very cleverly.  This is probably one of the only negative reviews, if not the only one, on this novel. Next I'll review Room--yet another disappointment. If you want to read something good, read Lionel Shriver's We Need to Talk About Kevin.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Game looks decent enough, but being forced into openfeint automatically gives you a 1/5 star.  I dont care how much you as the developer think it adds value, to me it never will.  Coupled with no option to opt out (which would have been an acceptable alternative), I will choose not to download or pay for future apps that support such a backwards practice.
0316098329|3.0|So many missed opportunities in this novel! While based very, very loosely on the true story of that nutty Austrian who locked his daughter up in some basement-type thing under his house and fathered several kids by her, this novel is not believable. First of all, the woman held captive is a stranger and was in her late teens or early twenties (I don't recall) when abducted. But, the real problem comes with the ridiculous escape scene. I'd need a full Home Depot's worth of rope and wire to suspend my disbelief for that one.<br /><br />Then, there was my one huge peeve because it nagged over and over throughout the book. Despite the fact that this kid has been born in captivity in American and never had any contact with anyone but his American born mother, the American man that holds them captive and their only media is American TV, the kid uses British (or should I say Irish) English at least as often as American English. What five year old American kid says \\"bum\\" for butt?<br /><br />Some of the gory details are what made parts believable, but the characters were not developed. There was so much that could have been more interesting. Little tidbits were tossed out like the fact that the mother/abductee was adopted, her habit of breast feeding her son at age five and the son was also the son of the man who abducted and raped her. Did she not resent the son on any level? Did he not remind her in anyway of this man? So many unexplored opportunities.
B002RT69QQ|5.0|very good and very comfortable product. so easy to use and very quiqkly to copy pictures from the camera to the computer. thank u!
0312576463|2.0|This novel is so penis-centered. Someone's penis is constantly pressing against his pants and there is always some uninteresting female character anxious to have it. Certainly only a book that a man would write.  I imagine that Franzen fancies himself a cross between the genius of Walter and the sexiness of Richard, but if his writing is reflective of his personality, he's a dull dork. His arrogance shines through in his male characters and his imperviousness to his own droning while his female characters are the most boring I have ever read (apart from that one crack pot that was practically stalking Patty when she was in college). The political interests of Walter are somewhat interesting, but never fully developed and population control is better addressed in Lionel Shriver's Game Control. By the end I didn't care if they all dropped dead.
B006ZEDZNY|1.0|What a waste of good talent.  Depp tried to carry the movie, but  didn't quite make it and relied on a shower scene to make it  interesting.  The rest was boring as hell.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is fun and entertaining. I keep trying to collect more nuts to purchase things. I like that feature. Getting it for free is just a plus.
B006ON41FC|5.0|great fun for the times you feel like a nut. simple gameplay makes this game very accessible but lots of different goals keeps it interesting once the novelty wears off.
B006ON41FC|5.0|best game highly addictive.and highly recommend for people who love fun. the most funniest free app j got ever. :)
B004H1V5RU|3.0|its so cool ... but it fade uo quickly cause u reach some where u cant pass  its in some where the metal ball stack in some where i have shack the whole game to let the ball out

0307957934|1.0|One thing I notice is that most of the reviews posted here give Robert Harris a pass based on his previous books. I can't do that as \\"The Fear Index\\" is my first exposure to this author, and will probably be my last. Let me boil it down to what most of the other negative reveiws dance around;<br /><br />\\"The Fear Index\\" is BORING!<br /><br />I'm not sure if you can really make a nail-biting suspense novel dealing with an arrogant, introvertered billionaire as your protagonist? If you someone can, it sure isn't Harris. We are introduced to the brilliant, and extremely wealthy Alex Hoffman, currently residing in a $60 Million dollar mansion in Geneva. Harris goes into great detail to let us know just how wealthy Hoffman is by pointing out his tons of rare and precious possessions; Darwin first editions, lamps, even the cutlery a would-be burgler/kidnapper may be using when committing a crime is top of the line. I get it, Hoffman is rich. He's rich because of a super-computer program that can analyze money markets around the globe and his ultra-rich investors pay well for that information. Hoffman finds that someone is out to take over his wealth and jeopardize his life and business.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any spoilers, but to be honest I really couldn't care what happened to Hoffman. He comes off as a snobbish, unlikable bore. Actually, none of the characters were likable. So then you have a bunch of unlikable twits running around for a couple hundred pages wondering what or who is after their wealth.<br /><br />I guess if you're a fan of this author you may want to give this yawn-fest a try.
0060558121|4.0|It's the old gods vs the new with man in between... but mostly unaware. Shadow, thinking himself just one of those average humans with a string of bad luck, is none-the-less, less than average, considering he fairly quickly accepted the fact that the ancient god whom approached him soon after being released from prison and discovering his beloved wife's death is indeed a god. What follows is a meandering tale of how Shadow finds himself in the midst of the struggle and in fact rather key to its outcome.<br /><br />Creepy, sexed out and deliciously bizarre American Gods is a book one will never call easy- but it can be fun, given half the chance. Me I love me some subtle wit, and Gaiman's pretty much mastered it. But that's not what made American Gods fun for me- no what I enjoyed most was his clever detailing of how the ancient gods came to our shores thru vignettes and dialogue. Well, that and the way they look now living on the peripheries of humanity and interacting with our hapless protagonist. I also loved Gaiman's bringing to life of our more recent idols- tv, credit cards and technology, among them.<br /><br />The sub plot with Shadow finding out who he really is- mostly begins with him hiding out in- and liking- the small town of Lakeside WI, while the old god Odin sets up his war. It definitely felt superfluous at times, yet it becomes a good framework for defining Shadow. I found myself looking forward to getting back to him after I'd set the book down and pick it up later. Something about the setting made Shadow more human- even though we suspect he is anything but at this point. Later he walks thru death, judgment, hell and the grave to find his beginning and his true nature. (Hunh, never thought we were headed into the existential when I started this book. Very nice surprise- I was positively riveted when Annubis put Shadow's heart on the scales!)<br /><br />Still it's the war of the gods (that's not a war at all) that defines the book. Ultimately American Gods is about what we as a western culture- specifically a North American culture- choose to believe as one nation. No longer are we believing in our own gods from our mother and father lands, and perhaps rightly so, so what are we believing in? Are the new American gods we are all are choosing to bow down too truly Technology and Science and Media? Gosh, it sure feels like that. Yeah, I'm not so sure I like those soulless fiends. But we have to believe in something because belief is what motivates us to \\"do\\", to make things better or to make things worse. I guess now we have to decide what is worthy to believe in before we lose our souls to worthless gods.<br /><br />Makes you think doesn't it?

B006ON41FC|5.0|So I was out camping with my fellow boy scouts at lake Livingston, when I decided to whip out my kindle fire and begin going nuts in front of everyone.  it wasn't long before others began to take notice me dodging nuts, trees, and various other objects I was flying towards...The other troops downloaded it cuz it was the faotd,  and they started going nuts as well...It didn't take long for the word to spread around camp...so the troop leaders got together in excitement and concluded that the time had come...  They all downloaded the app too...what did you expect? pervert...
B0066W1AZK|2.0|This game is good and fun, but beware if you get better. I'm no chess master, but every once in a while I get in a good game. The problem is when I get the game in a spot where it's guaranteed to lose half the time it freezes. I even tried using undo to go back moves and unfreeze it-no luck. I had this same app on my smart phone and it does the same thing. If you just want a free chess app it's okay, but if you take the game seriously find a different software company's program.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the trilogy over a period of 4 days, because I quite simply could not put it down!  I am not generally a huge fan of this genre, but after hearing family and friends rave about The Hunger Games, I had to check it out.  The characters are very well developed, the plot line is engaging and relevant, and the style of writing is simple, yet very descriptive.  As soon as I finished the last book, I went right back to the beginning to start it over to make sure I didn't miss a thing.  Highly recommended to anyone who...,well anyone really!  I just hope the movies honor the books!
B006ON41FC|1.0|I've never opted in to Openfeint and can't support an app that does not respect my choice to not use it.  Lack of sound controls is an inexcusable oversight.  Both are indications of a lazy developer with no interest in doing things &quot;right&quot;.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Please make open terrible an opt in not a requirement. I would then reconsider. Every other game lets you choose, and this one should too.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|shipping was quick but DVD condition wasn't great...two of the DVDs in the set had scratches that made the movies unreadable for a seen or two.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fantastic game.. easy to control. Looks great. Fun to play. It's the perfect pick up and play a few minutes game.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|I've been a VH fan for 30+ years and I was so excited they were finally going to get their act together and release an album. After listening to it one time through, I suddenly realized how much I miss Michael Anthony, you don't realize how much of the backing vocals were him and how his voice helped define VH.  On the plus side, Ed seems to have come back from where ever he has been for the past 10+ years and become his old self. The guitars are smokin and Alex doesn't miss a beat, gotta love the double bass. I will even hand it to Wolfie, the kid can play.  Dave's vocals are decent, I will admit I have always liked Sammy better. Dave's style is more creative and less formulaic compared to Sam.  My top three songs are You and your blues, blood and fire and big river.  All three are could get radio play. My one complaint is there are too many old songs that have been retooled. I've heard several on old boots over the years, so it kind of feels like this is half a new album. Every time I listen to a song I suddenly find myself wondering what album it could have been from. Several songs have similar sounds to past albums so I can't help but wonder if every song was a leftover, simply re-tooled with new or updated vocals. I guess we will never know and it probably doesn't matter. Let's hope this is the spark to get them to work on a follow up before they implode. If Ed is sober and Dave can keep his mouth shut, they will be ok. Otherwise, Sam might be getting a call.

B006ON41FC|1.0|Very disappointing that this developer chose to mandate feint.  Other games make it optional (Of course, when you opt out, feint makes you reply &quot;No, I don't like fun,&quot; which just shows how unprofessional and disreputable feint is). Note to all future developers: Please DO NOT force the user to participate in feint!  This is extremely unfair to the user, regardless of your opinion of feint.

B000002AGE|5.0|I know I came late to this party so I won't add anything more about the magnificence of the album. I would just add my two cents and say that I may be in the minority but the gem on this album is the little known \\"The Juggler\\". It's beauty is sublime and truly captures the soul of this masterpiece of music which will live long after we're all gone...
B006ZBRMOU|4.0|So that's it.<br />No more Christian Grey, except for in my dreams and the inevitable reread.<br />The reason I'm docking a star is because there were parts for me where it was getting a little repetitive. For e.g. Ana saying 'oh my' or 'holy cow' was really getting on my nerves or the whole 'mine' 'yours' thing.<br />Possibly the reason for this is that I read the three books one straight after the other in the space of 5 days.<br />Perhaps if I had read them as they were published this wouldn't even have been noticeable to me.<br />But I'll never know because they were all already out when I started reading them and there was nothing in this world that was going to drag me away from my Christian..that's right people, he's mine, so just back off and don't be annoying him wasting your time fluttering your eye's at him!!!<br />Also what happened with Mia & Ethan??????? If we weren't really going to find out then they shouldn't have been brought into the story (as a possible couple) IMO.<br />And I think the epilogue was unnecessary as I felt it was a given. Again that's just in my opinion, I'm sure other people loved it.<br />I did enjoy Christians POV of their first couple of meetings that was a great addition. I'd love his POV of when Ana left him at the end of the first book.

I would advise anyone who gets this book to have books 2 & 3 at the ready.<br />If you are not a fan of erotica than this may not be for you but if you can get passed the BDSM than this is soooooo much more. It is a wonderful love story!<br />I don't know if it's just me but it really reminds me in an odd way of Jane Eyre...but a lot kinkier!<br />This story made me feel so many emotions, anger,happiness,giddyness. I sighed, I swooned, I laughed out loud. I loved it, what more can I say.<br />E.L. James I salute you.

0061914177|5.0|I saw one of Gary's videos online and heard him mention this book. Ordered it, started reading, and could not put it down. Gary does a great job of sharing with you his passion and encouraging you to find your passion in life and pursue it. Too many people are stuck in a job that they do not love because they feel like it is the only way to go. Gary thinks otherwise and after reading, you will too. Great stuff!
B004WE01YA|3.0|Here's the thing - It's a great movie!!!  Top notch!  The discs have problems!  Shabby!  So is Disney listening yet?  You'd think the \\"Diamond Edition\\" would be better quality.  Hoping my replacement will be.  By the way, if you're listening Disney - really glad of all the kudos you heaped on the animators, Ashman and Menkin, etc.  Yet the only reference I heard in all the discs about Jerry Orbach was that (paraphrased) before that Law and Order thing he had been a big \\"song and dance man\\" (not broadway star, not Tony Winner) in the 60's (and none of the staff had heard of him). Fine - but in the Diamond (20th Anniversary) Edition couldn't they have said and \\"now his voice is used on everything...the menu's...etc.  I mean, come'on - he actually performed \\"Be Our Guest\\" at the Oscars.  He's the only one of the main cast that's passed away.  NOTHING?  Did I miss it?
B003EYVY0E|4.0|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban<br />Ultimate Blu-ray Edition<br /><br />Year:  2004<br />Rating:  PG<br />Runtime:  2 HRS, 21 MIN<br /><br />Director:  Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n<br />Starring:  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, Timothy Spall, and Gary Oldman<br /><br />Film Rating:  5 out of 5 stars<br />Video Rating:  4 out of 5 stars<br />Audio Rating:  3 out of 5 stars<br />Extras:  3 out of 5 stars<br />Overall Rating:  4 out of 5 stars<br /><br />The Film<br /><br />For those of you that read my previous reviews of Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets we've firmly established that I didn't enjoy the first two Harry Potter entries upon my first viewings.  After 2002's Chamber of Secrets I vowed that I was through with Harry Potter for good.  Jump ahead to late 2003/early 2004 and I happened to watch the trailer for third film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and my interest in the franchise was rekindled.<br /><br />Harry's third year at Hogwarts is again filled with danger and mystery.  After running away from his aunt and uncle's house Harry finds out that he's once again a marked man.  Mass murderer, Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban Prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge Voldemort.  To make matters worse the school is now home to the Dementors of Azkaban who are searching for Sirius Black and have a terrible affect on Harry.  In addition to all of that, Harry must try and win the Quiddich Cup, meet his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and find out how Sirius Black has ties to Voldemort, his parents, and even himself.<br /><br />This is the film that turned around the whole franchise for me but it wasn't just one or two improvements that made me change my mind on Harry Potter.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban improves on the original two films in almost every conceivable way; tone, effects, direction, pacing, and the quality of the acting and the new cast additions are just a few of the ways that this film improves over previous installments.  Is there still humor in the film?  Yes.  Is it cringe worthy?  No, its natural character humor and it's not all sight gags either.  The kids begin to \\"own\\" their characters more by injecting more of their own personalities into their roles.  The CGI continues to improve the further you move into the series, a lot of the effects are so subtle you'll hardly notice they're effects at all.  The use of puppetry is more apparent in Prisoner of Azkaban than any of the previous films.  At times it doesn't always match up perfectly with the CGI but I let most of those imperfections slide because of my love of practical effects.  Gone is director Chris Columbus, who was good working with children but his films lacked visual flare and any sense of foreboding.  Columbus does stick around as a producer for this film but his influence seems minimal at best.  Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (Great Expectations, Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n, Children of Men) steps into the director's chair and makes an immediate difference in the tone and look of the film.  Cuar&oacute;n's use of wide angle lenses allows for more of the film's frame to appear sharp and allows both the foreground and background to be in focus at the same.  Prisoner of Azkaban is dark and moody but is also an extremely handsome looking film that makes portions of Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets look like a high budgeted TV movie.  The farther into the series you go the more complicated the books become but beginning with this film the story is streamlined to focus more on Harry's story and less on the surrounding characters secondary plot lines.  Potter book fanatics dislike this because beloved sections of the novels are cut from the films.  It's necessary however to keep the story moving towards it's goal and the pacing of Azkaban is helped by this.  While shorter than Sorcerer's Stoneor Chamber of Secrets, Azkaban flies by hardly feeling like a 2 hour, 21 minute film.  One of my few complaints about Azkaban is that I wish it was a little longer so I could enjoy it just a little more.<br /><br />All the Potter films have had incredible casts filled with some of the best English actors working today but Azkaban might be my favorite.  After Chamber of Secrets had finished shooting, Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore) became ill.  He persuaded producers not to recast his role (they agreed) but shortly before the film was released Harris died.  The producers then had the difficult task of recasting the Dumbledore role.  Ian McKellen was offered the role but he turned it down since he had recently played Gandolf in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and because he thought it would be inappropriate since Richard Harris had once referred to him as a \\"dreadful\\" actor.  The estate of Richard Harris wanted the role to go to Richard's close friend Peter O'Toole but he also turned it down.  Christopher Lee and Richard Attenborough expressed interest in taking over the role but ultimately it went to Michael Gambon (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Open Range).  The casting of Gambon isn't universally loved by all Potter fans but I think his portrayal of Dumbledore is more energetic and lively than what Richard Harris was capable of in his later years.<br /><br />David Thewlis (Kingdom of Heaven, The Big Lebowski) is this years Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, a poor but kind man with a terrible secret.  Lupin is one of my favorite characters from the books and I can't imagine anyone but Thewlis playing him.  Before seeing him in this I had only seen Thewlis in a few films but since he's become one of my favorite actors and I make a point to see whatever he's in.  Timothy Spall and Emma Thompson also join the cast and while their screen time is limited they make the most of it.  The biggest contribution to the cast comes in the form of Gary Oldman (Batman Begins, The Fifth Element, Sid & Nancy) playing the escaped killer Sirius Black.  Knowing he was in this movie helped re-interest me in the franchise and I wasn't disappointed.  Gary Oldman is like a chameleon, he's always able to reinvent himself and put in an amazing performance even in a small role.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite film so far in the franchise.  Some Potter purest's have had an issue with the streamlining of the plot but I think it makes Azkaban a more accessible film to non-hardcore fans.  I love the great additions to the cast, the new director and his stylistic choices, and how the maturing subject matter is handled.  This is where the Potter films really hit their stride and show the great potential of the future films.<br /><br />The Blu-ray<br /><br />\\"If it's not broke, don't fix it\\" should be a term that the folks at Warner Brothers Home Video should learn.  Packaging is a big deal to me especially when the set is expensive, large, and is just one part of a larger set.  Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were released in December 2009 and Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire (review coming next week) were released in October 2010.  Within that ten month period the powers at be decided to change the packaging.  The first two Blu-ray sets feature a cardboard slipcover with raised lettering that slides vertically over the rest of the package  This set (and Goblet of Fire) is slightly taller and instead of raised lettering have a lenticular card inserted on the front cover.  They also slide horizontally over the rest of the package.  The new design doesn't work as well as the first sets for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />  -The lenticular card can come out but that causes the flaps holding it in to stick out slightly.<br />  -The slipcover folds together but the seam isn't flush and pushes the sets apart when they're on the shelf.  The slipcover on the first two sets are glued instead of folded so they sit next to each other much better.<br /><br />None of these issues are a deal breaker for they're still handsome looking sets.  I just don't understand why you would change the design to the point that they don't match each other when they're lined up especially when the sets cost $30 or more each.  Once inside the sturdy cardboard slipcover you'll find just the theatrical cut of the film.  Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n was given the opportunity to assemble an extended cut but declined saying that the theatrical cut was his preferred version of the film.  There's of course a second Blu-ray loaded with special features, a standard-def (SD) DVD of special features, a digital copy code (no separate disc), the collectible book, and two character cards (Hermione Granger, Sirius Black).<br /><br />If you were disappointed with the packaging you're not going to be disappointed with the video or audio quality however.  With each progressive film they continue to impress in terms of picture quality.  This is the same transfer used on the previously released Blu-ray and HD-DVD and it still looks great even four years later.  Detail is excellent, there's no obvious edge enhancement, artifacting, or DNR which considering how much of the film is cloaked in fog, shadow, and darkness is quite a feat.  There's a little bit of black crushing during the darkest of scenes but it's quickly gone and I hardly noticed it.<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track sounds fantastic.  Dialogue is always clear and never gets lost even when the action picks up.  The surround channels are very active, from mysterious creaking noises to brooms zooming by there are plenty of directional effects.  The LFE channel gets a good workout as well, especially during the thunderstorm filled Quidditch match and scenes in the Forbidden Forest.  John Williams final Harry Potter score sounds wonderful, always sounding clear and at the right level not overpowering of what's happening on screen.<br /><br />Prisoner of Azkaban DOES NOT feature a PiP track like the two previous Ultimate Edition Blu-rays have.  No explanation has been given on why a PiP track wasn't made for this film but I'm disappointed that it's missing.  Since Azkaban is my favorite Potter film I would have loved to have seen more of a behind the scenes look at the film.  Packaging this as an Ultimate Edition without an Extended Cut of the film and no PiP track is seems a little disingenuous to me.  Thankfully not all is lost, there is still the third part of the Creating the World of Harry Potter documentary.  Part III Creatures focuses on just that, all the different creatures featured in the Harry Potter world. Hippogriffs to Goblins to Voldemort himself are covered here in this 63 minute doc.  You get a very interesting look at the creature effects shop, models, make-up, how the CGI is done and how the process has changed in the last 10+ years.  Easily the best feature of the set considering the exclusion of the aforementioned PiP commentary.  Also included are a collection of deleted scenes (presented in HD), some SD vintage TV docs, a SD interview with Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, a short featurette about the how people are transformed in the make-up chair (also in HD), and three trailers (all in HD). A third disc, a standard definition DVD, is included that has some other special features from past DVD releases but I don't even bother putting that garbage in my players anymore.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban isn't just a wonderful Harry Potter film, it's wonderful film period.  Unfortunately it's harder to recommend this Ultimate Edition since you don't get as much bang for you buck as you did with the first two Ultimate Editions.  For a cheaper option you can pick up the single disc Blu-ray for around $10.man (Batman Begins, The Fifth Element, Sid & Nancy) playing the escaped killer Sirius Black.

Also included are a collection of deleted scenes (presented in HD), some SD vintage TV docs, a SD interview with Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, a short featurette about the how people are transformed in the make-up chair (also in HD), and three trailers (all in HD). A third disc, a standard definition DVD, is included that has some other special features from past DVD releases but I don't even bother putting that garbage in my players anymore.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban isn't just a wonderful Harry Potter film, it's wonderful film period.  Unfortunately it's harder to recommend this Ultimate Edition since you don't get as much bang for you buck as you did with the first two Ultimate Editions.  For a cheaper option you can pick up the single disc Blu-ray for around $10.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've had this cover for nearly six months now and I throughly recommend it. It is made from a durable material which feels tough in the hand (unlike squidgy silicone) but is soft enough to absorb drops. I have dropped it a few times and it has protected my iPhone...so far! Last, you can't beat Amazon's price!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|What can I say about the knife? Its a monster. Quarter inch thick, full tang, and built like a truck. When I was pulling it from its sheath(for the first time) I had my finger too close to the opening, and it cut my finger BAD.The fat was hanging out of the wound it was so bad. PLEASE BE CAREFUL , pulling these from the sheath. Grasp it by the sheath ONLY, and have ur fingers NOWHERE near the opening.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've picked this book up a million times to read, but never thought I would enjoy it.  So glad that I finally decided to give it a try.  It lured me in and held my attention through out the whole book.  It was by far one of the best books I've read in a while!!

B006P0FIB0|2.0|As a kid I loved the 3 Musketeers and the young witty teenager who became the fourth.  In this version there was good, bad and UGLY...  The good. Action, sword fights scenes, acting and logistics (the set, the colors, the cloths and scenery were first class.  The bad. The plot started-out well enough and then CGI computer effects, writing shortcuts and flying boats made a promising movie just plane lame and stupid. As a Syfy nut myself, I can leave reality at the door, but I cannot suspend it to a point of total stupidity, and you can not fix stupid.  The ugly. About 30 minutes before the movie ended, I could not help but think the writers wrote this movie into a corner. Instead of thinking a witty and/or plausible way to tie up all the loose ends they made, the writers figured the average person is a dolt (idiot) and if they threw a bunch of CGI and lame excuses and bizarre explanations that people would become confused and forget how bad and implausible the story became. What I am really disappointed in is with a movie with as many good to excellent actors, that none of them went, \\"You got to be kidding me!\\" and forced the writers into fixing this honorably story line. Well I guess I can now assume all parties involved in this flop were only too happy to cash their pay check versus delivering a real memorable and classic film.

B006ON41FC|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game.  Found it easy to understand. Great game to waste time while waiting. Only thing is some of the goals or crazy hard.
B006ON41FC|1.0|even if you put aside all the o. f. issues, you're still left with a game that lags so much that it is unplayable on amazon's fire tablet
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is lots of fun, has good music, and it gets more challenging as you go. Also, it's great on Kindle Fire.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|CAUTION: SPOILERS INCLUDED.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Hunger Games trilogy up until the last 1/3 of this, the final book.  I respect an author's right to craft their ideas and storylines as they see fit.  After all, it's the author's work.  Consequently, you will very seldom find me leaving a negative review of a book because of the way the author finishes it.  This is one of those rare times.  I titled my review Unimaginative because that's what the last 1/3 of this book was.  I can hear the arguments now.  \\"What a dramatic way to finish the series, she took what we all expected and rejected it, finishing the series in a way that proves everyone really is a pawn and no one is necessary to the true cause,\\" blah blah blah.  Bull.  It seems that once Collins got rolling on killing off characters, she just couldn't stop.  I'm truly surprised that she didn't kill Gale somehow.  That would have made the bitter ending even more so, because Katniss would have forever been wondering if he would have been the one, but she had to end up with Peeta because he was the only person left.  While I think killing everyone off was not necessary (for instance, Finnick would have been a good character to keep around, instead we get to assume he gets shredded by mutts for no good reason), that isn't even my chief complaint.  What really bothers me is how Collins just skips the whole end of the conflict, blows up Prim and knocks Katniss out so that the conflict ends but all we get to hear about is Katniss feeling like she's sprouting wings of fire.  She wakes up and someone fills her in on what happened, which was very anti-climatic.  Basically, a bunch of kids and Prim get killed, and Snow just gives up.  Could it be any more unimaginative?  I doubt it.  I also thought the sequence at the end was rushed.  The rebels are progressing through the city, yet they manage to all of a sudden thrwart all of the capital's pod traps and arrive in the city center at the same moment Katniss does?  Really?  Unimaginative.  I feel like Collins got bored writing and decided to just end it.  The final book could have been a hundred pages longer, or could have been split into two slightly shorter books.  Either way, it would have been better than the way she actually does finish it.  This series had such promise, utilizing a taboo subject but making it interesting and engaging, making me want more.  But now here I am, wishing I hadn't wasted my time.
B000001ELB|5.0|In my opinion this is the best greatest hits album of all time.  Twenty of Kiss' best on one CD. If you're a Kiss fan, you must buy it to complete your collection.  If you're not a fan, but want a snapshot of classic 70's hard rock, this is a great album to purchase.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I'm using this with and iTouch 4 and Shure SE535 headphones. The sound is excellent. My reason for giving this only four starts is the sound was almost as good without the amp. The amp does boost the bass a bit, while maintaining the smoothness of the bass (no boomyness) and clarity at other frequencies. The earphones I have, have a short cord, and I use an extender. This very small light amp goes at the end of the earphone cord and thus is near my shoulder. It is convenient to adjust the volume and is so light you don't notice it. I have never had the opportunity of trying a $400+ \\"audiophile\\" amp. However, at the price this is a worthwhile.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is fun with tons of achiements to earn and nuts to collect. I don't care about open feint and that it,&quot;doesn't &quot; close.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Open Feint included equals one star subtracted. Open Feint forced down your throat like a particularly unpleasant uncle giving you his view on why the Confederacy was misunderstood... That equals automatic one star maximum no matter what.  Add if their patronizing &quot;I don't like fun&quot; standard opt out want bad enough. Not everyone wants to see your cancerous and intrusive software dumped in every game on the planet.
B006ISJQBM|2.0|I think the book must be way better. I have not read the novel but it seems one of those many cases when the movie based on a novel does not live up to expectations. I found the movie underdeveloped and as result boring and forgettable. One watch is more than enough for me.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Great cover! -Easy to hold and won't slip out of your hand.  Most people think I have an old book and not an e-reader.Easily stands on it's own for ease of long video veiwing.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|The movie kept my attention, and has a neat look on future currency.  However, its plot takes a weird turn towards the end. Maybe save it for discount bin.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I will not go any further with this game because of the forced open feint. I do NOT want it on my phone.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|I got this housing for my GoPro so I could use an external mic for recording sound while driving and it does it's job. I am using the [[ASIN:B00006HOLL Sony ECM-DS70P Electret Condenser Stereo Microphone]] with a cover to reduce wind noise. Before this cover came out, people were cutting up their stock housing to use a mic, no more...
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|First of all this is a fun hidden object game in the normal sense, but there are variations of typical list and find play that make the game a little more interesting.
B005HSL626|5.0|who cares about ads? its still fun and you can still play! I love arcade mode where you can get the freeze bananas, the X2 bananas, plus there's so much more to do!
B006ON41FC|2.0|Had promise but due to not being able to opt out of openfeint, the controls lagged horribly on the incredible 2. Not worth the download.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|I was pretty unhappy when I got this album. I hadn't heard any songs off of it yet, but it's Coldplay, and even though I wasn't a huge fan of Viva la Vida, it was still a good album, and it grew on me. This one however was not what I was hoping for. The style has changed too much for me. I've enjoyed every album less since the epic \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". I'm not saying it's a bad album, or that there isn't quality there, but Coldplay has moved too far away from what I like. I'm not planning on buying a newer album until I've heard it from now on. Longtime Coldplay fans beware...do yourself a favor and take a listen first.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games.are ok.they could.be a little faster tho. the games are cool. the. games need more better graphics it.can. use some.improvements
B006ON41FC|5.0|Lots of fun so far on my Bionic. Very fun gameplay and it keeps me coming back! Fill your cheeks with nuts
B006UG90RM|3.0|Love the Record! Ok CD. But like some I was worried about how it would sound. I agree with those who say that Dave's vocals are to loud. And the Kick Drum and Drum tracks need to be louder. But the cymbals and snare drum are fine. Love Wolf's playing! But some of those Bass tracks need to be louder also. So Drums, Vocals, and Bass could use a remastering. When I saw it was mixed at 5150 I was a little worried. With my CD recorder and EQ I will be able to fix it up some. The material rocks though. Thanks guys!! Now we need a DVD of the tour. And please guys, put the sound quality of the DVD first. Make it sound HEAVY!  NOT clean,clear,crisp and thin. It's a top priority. It makes the whole experience!!
0307389839|4.0|For some unknown reason, Murakami's writing voice is one of the few that I truly love (in the same sense that there are a few authors who I find particularly grating). So I'm not even sure how objective I can be here. Suffice it to say that I found this book a quick read, entertaining, and very inspiring. It makes me want to run, and it makes me want to write. The only thing that would have made it better for me would have been more content about his writing and process.
1619491303|5.0|From the time one enters elementary school, we have heard about Darwin's famous concepts. We've all heard of his famous journey on the H.M.S. Beagle to the Galapagos Islands on which he studied numerous species of plant and animal life. We all know that his observations there lead him to the deduction of evolution.  However, how many of us have actually read his original work? Due to an illness, Darwin published On the Origin of Species before he believed it was finished. However, he had spent the better part of 20 years gathering and organizing his information. At the time, evolution was a radical idea, as many scientists believed that species were independently created and incapable of change. In the interest of brevity, Darwin summarized his findings and filed them neatly into titled sections within chapters of specific observations. There observations led him to conclude that present day plants and animals were not stagnant representations of their ancestors, but rather products of a process called natural selection.  A famous poster in many grade school science classrooms depicts a series of sketches of an ape slowly standing upright until it finally resembles a present day human.  If you recall this Darwinian concept that humans evolved from a single common ancestor, it may surprise you to learn that Darwin believed that some domesticated plants and animals have multiple species as ancestors. He observed that the countless variations among domestic species, such as dogs, were far too vast to be caused by the evolution of a single shared ancestor. By selectively breeding plants and animals, humans are practicing a sort of unnatural selection. Darwin tested this hypothesis of artificial modification as a means to evolution by observing the breeding of two different types of carrier pigeons. This man-made alteration created a fertile hybrid bird. However, Darwin's bird's fertility suggested to him that his idea of multiple origins was correct as the new bird could now produce similar offspring. This way of creating new species is more common in domesticated species rather than wild species as wild species are less likely to breed across specie boundaries. Furthermore, fertile hybrids face much difficulty in reproducing healthy offspring. In order to create more of their new distinct species, the rare fertile ones would need to breed with other hybrids, likely their siblings, which could cause biological detriments. Darwin noted that this theory was only applicable for the offspring of two similar species, such as two types of birds, as there had been no case in which a fertile offspring was produced by two immensely distinct species.  Gradual changes also occur in wild plants and animals. In what would become his legacy, Darwin looked at the evolution of undomesticated plants and animals while in the Galapagos. According to Darwin's famous theory of natural selection, only the finest individuals of a given species survive. To demonstrate this, he observed that plants and animals with different features live in different elements. Individuals with well-suited traits are more likely to survive. These individuals were therefore more likely to breed and pass on their traits. Offspring with these beneficial traits continued to pass the traits on. Today, we refer to this idea as \\"survival of the fittest.\\" Additionally, many animals adapt to climate over time. For domestic animals, it may be caused by multiple bloodlines from wild ancient animals that were fit for different climates. For wild animals, the transition from a parent species artic climate to a present day tropical one most likely took many generations of evolution to complete.  Constant adaptation as a progression to biological development was not a commonly held idea amongst Darwin's peers. While they had correctly identified that animals in certain areas, such as near the shoreline, had different features than their counter-parts that lived in different conditions,they failed to recognize adaptation because the believed that animals were static representations of their ancestors. Darwin, however, was skeptical of this idea and decided to put it to the test. From the same observations, Darwin performed some of the aforementioned experiments. In a logical deduction, Darwin concluded that it was only over the course of time that these individuals living in a specific environment adapted to the conditions and began to change form.  Darwin compared his theory of evolution to the geological processes that have shaped our planet since the dawn of time. No one can see these small changes happening just as one can see the erosion a small stream causes. Only over many years does a small stream carve out a grand canyon. This is how the evolution of species works. Small modifications accumulate until new species are formed. This concept allowed Darwin to explain phenomenon such as the flightless bird. Over many generations, the ostrich began to rely on its powerful legs for protection so much so that it no longer needed to use its wings as an escape mechanism. Today, after many generations of disuse, the ostrich's wings are essentially useless.  Overall, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species is a groundbreaking and brilliant book, especially if you take into account the fact that it was first published over 150 years ago. It's well organized and full of evidence from which Darwin's conclusion seems logical. The research in this On the Origin of Species caused the plant and animal development paradigm to shift. In addition, Darwin's work set a foundation on which many present day evolutionary scientists' work is based. If you are looking for a fascinating account of the observations that lead to Charles Darwin's conclusion of evolution, it would be wise to read Darwin's book, On the Origin of Species.  Works Cited  Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species. 1859.

B004XE0P5E|3.0|Well not exactly a new artist (he's been around for a couple of years now) but still, Justin Vernon's nasally and girlish voice is tolerable when he has some solid songs in him like on his first full-length record, the beautiful \\"For Emma\\". This new record \\"Bon Iver\\" has is emotional consistency along with experimentation and unusual production values--one suspects--to make up for the tunes this record is lacking in. It's nice to listen to, but just doesn't stay with me the way \\"For Emma\\" did and still does.

B005ZUR724|5.0|The game has great graphics, gameplay, and players. However gameloft makes it evident that they do not care about its subscribers. They make it extremely hard to level. Gameloft should also ether stop in-game purchases (ec. runestones) or make them cheeper. It is absurd to expect people to spend 99 cents on something that will last them 30 minutes.

B006ON41FC|3.0|For now, just play in airplane mode and mute sound if too much 4U.  Yes, open-fart needs 2B optional but you should not let that stop you from having an otherwise cute fun game. Hopefully the maker will give this a nice update and everyone will be happy. If anything I would Download for future use.

Thanks Dave, Eddie, Alex, and Wolfie for a job well done.  Now hopefully I will get tickets for the Reading, Pa show!  Please don't make us wait so long for a new CD.  So many found memories of Van Halen,  that this CD makes me feel young again!  Rock on!

0955153077|5.0|I have read so many books and tutorials about it, I have to say this is the best, because it start teaching about composition and light and teach the basics... SO if Someone want to learn or how to its the best start point for anyone. also you find the artist in this book are very professional, very good illustrated as everything in 3dtotal.
0545259088|5.0|There are a lot of reviews that cover the story line of this book series....so I won't go into that.  I'll keep it short and sweet....I think it's a fun, different story line for a teen audience.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I went ahead and tried this game (DroidX) and it runs very smoothly, it's challenging, there are goals to achieve, I could go on. You can exit open feint. Clicking on the Open Feint tab and then click the menu button. Gives you options. Choose exit Open Feint. Not difficult in the least. It's a great game. Stop giving one star just because you can't figure it out and don't even ask about it. Again, it's a fun, addicting game. Thanks, developer and Amazon, for the free app of the day!
B0071T5PN0|5.0|This album is TIGHT. This band is TIGHT! Try playing \\"As is\\" loud in your car with the windows down and tell me you don't feel something. Tell me the Eddie and Dave magic isn't there. My top tracks are \\"Chinatown\\", \\"As Is\\", and \\"Outa Space\\". \\"As Is\\" is pure gold...never thought I'd hear a new VH song this good again. ALL songs on this album do grow on you, even Tattoo with the great line \\"Housewife to bombshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo ...\\".
0375758992|5.0|This is like sharing a weekend with your very best friend who tells    you her very best stories.  And you love them!    Next?  Cocktails Under the Tree of Forgetfulness.  Can't wait.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|In short this series is one of the best things I have seen on TV ever. Right from the word go, I was transported to Westeros and lead through a complex web of stories.  The production values were incredible, the sets and landscapes and costumes were beyond incredible. Some of the cutaways were just amazing, seeing into the kitchen between two important scenes just made everything seem so real. MAGICAL!  The performances were all amazing too, I believed every character and felt every interaction and motivation.  The scripts were incredible and each episode well paced and packed full of amazing content.  There was no other way to tell this epic story, HBO have done an amazing job, and as a fan of the book I feel even better knowing the author (Martin) was heavilly involved and consulted quite closely with the entire team involved.  Buy it and support this AMAZING show.
B0071QIN00|3.0|lvl design is really poor. took what could have been a great game and turned it into a frustraiting mess. some lvls are not even completable. played on kindle fire. I would not really buy it again knowing how poor the Lvov design is.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Not really sure where all the praise for this game is coming from. It's repetitive, frustrating, and gets old really quick. The touch controls on the Fire occasionally freak out, causing you to pick up the wrong item. The graphics are nice and overall the game seems well put together. I guess it's a good game if you like doing the same things over and over.
B006ON41FC|3.0|This is a good game.<br />Open Feint can be disabled. Music and/or sound f/x can be muted.<br />Gets a bit repetitious, but good distraction.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I found this app helpful.  I can get my forecast in my current location, or change the zip code for travel destinations.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best Bible app! Devotionals, different versions, reading plans... you name it! I use it for personal use, but our whole family uses it for family devotions. The kids love it!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have never had a problem with this application.  I have used it on multiple devices and it is the app I download the amazon app store for.  You just have to learn how to use it effectively.
B006ON41FC|3.0|The control on kindle fire does not seem to be 100% accurate 100% of the time but most of the time it is fairly good. In the faint for achievements and the store it seems to freeze at times but overall this game is fun and is worth trying out. It has some replayability just to hit goals and get achievements. I can see children enjoying this but it is a bit hard for younger kids. Hopefully no squirrels were harmed during the making of this game!!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I think its really fun and as addicitive as temple run. why is everyone complaining about OpenFeint, its the best part of the game. stop being so picky.
0156027321|5.0|Rarely do you come along a \\"bestselling\\" book that sticks with you for quite as long as this one. Martel's exploration of truth as expressed through myth is a fascinating journey and well worth the days and nights out at sea. Profound, painful and excellent.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay made me very nervous about reading it. I was so afraid that it wouldn't live up to the previous two books--but it did! It was a great book with a strong ending for Katniss et al. You won't be disappointed. While I won't give any spoilers here, I think that's enough for you to get an idea that you won't be burned by this incredible finale to the series.
0684171600|5.0|A classic for a reason. This novel is jam-packed full of harrowing adventure. We were riveted by swashbuckling pirates and the noble men who confront them and we learned a lot of sailing terms along the way. Long John Silver is a character to remember!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing Spider.  Now I can play anywhere!  It was easy to download.  Commercials are only shown once per game, before you start playing.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Mandatory Feint is like spyware. Even if the game were excellent (it isn't), Feint is a dealkiller. Uncontrollable music only makes it worse.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is the best app I have ever ever ever ever ever bought!!!! Would reccomend!! Tread app!! Great deal!! Buy this game now!!!
B006ON41FC|1.0|How dare you have that crap Open Feint auto connect!  App gets an automatic 1 star rating!  It's bad enough that you are even using Open Feint, but not to use the standard opt-out method is totally unacceptable.  Better yet, ask if we even want Open Feint enabled in the first place (i.e. no Open Feint splash screen or connection whatsoever).  Better yet, yet, DON'T USE OPEN FEINT AT ALL.  Fortunately, I do have a way to disable Open Feint--I hit the uninstall button.  Addition to original post:  Has anyone else noticed that a lot of the 5-star reviews are from first time app reviewers?  Seems pretty strange for a game that is, to be honest, very mediocre (this is no Angry Birds or Plants vs Zombies).  This game is nothing special and really doesn't do much--it's the same thing as the app Dead Runner--you move forward and try not to hit a tree (but at least Dead Runner gives you 3 modes of play).  Seems like some ratings padding goin' on--I'm just sayin'.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Thank you to the other reviewers about the Open Feint warning. I don't mind developers using it with their games but I don't agree with it if they don't give you the option to opt-out. Sounds like this game doesn't so as I was installing it I read the reviews, saw the warnings, and immediately uninstalled it without opening it. The rating I gave is based on this and not the game play itself.
B006ON41FC|2.0|Not only does it force open feint (yuck) on you, but I couldn't find any way to turned off sound...two big negatives for me. Too bad. It looked like a fun game but I have uninstalled.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I despise open feint and call me strange but I opt out, always, because I guess I am not cool enough to know what fun is. This game forces feint on you. Uninstalling.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Thanks for the warning about the inability to opt out. I'm even more bothered by a game that creates an account, if I've read other reviews correctly. That is nefarious activity worthy of delisting.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Dave Mustaine brought the original bassman Dave Ellefson back for their masterpiece 13th album. While not as fast as Endgame, the signature Megadeth sound is alive and well in 13. The guitar riffs, leads, and lyrics are as proof that Megadeth stays metal, unlike those whiny sissies Metallica. No failures or disappointments with 13.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love that I can arrange my notes and ideas and share them with my busy family. its a great app and its even better because its free.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It takes forever to load videos/music on utube, would this help? Or is it truly a virus. Any other app suggeted to download or just watch a video/music on utube?
1595827684|5.0|I just received mine today. I was speculative of buying this book, as I never bought an art book or making of for a game before, but I just love the Mass Effect games, so I had to try my hand at it. And boy, am I glad I did! The quality of the pages are excellent--thick pages allow for the colors to pop off the page. Most of the art has something written to accompany them. The Art spans across all three games. There were some things written that I wish were really able to be incorporated into the game. For example, did you know The Arrival DLC was at first, going to be underwater? To end, this will be a great piece to look at before Mass Effect 3 comes out (Yes, does contain some spoilers, but I'm not the type to care) and after I beat it. If you are a fan of anything and everything Mass Effect, and never bought the first Art Book, you won't be disappointed with this wonderful collection.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is addicting at first, but you have to play too many games to unlock levels. not bad for a free app
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Breaking Bad's second season is darker than the first.  There are some humorous moments (usually at Jesse's expense), but overall this season is much more \\"intense\\".<br /><br />\\"The Sopranos\\" and \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" are entertaining crime dramas, but they don't pull me in the way this show does. I know of no other TV series or movie about an illegal enterprise where you actually witness the \\"business\\" being put together, almost in real time, while the law desperately scrambles to stop it. That whole process in itself makes for fascinating viewing.<br /><br />Again, this series in no way glorifies drug taking or drug trafficking (quite the opposite), and it's pretty interesting how they manage to make this seem so viscerally realistic without excess profanity or violence.<br /><br />I don't want to go into detail without spoiling the plot, but suffice it to say Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul continue to be amazing together onscreen.  Anna Gunn gets more screen time, as do Dean Norris and RJ Mitte - and this season they further prove how great the entire cast is.<br /><br />I'll just conclude by saying that the last episode of season two is heartbreaking to watch, but up to this point,  Breaking Bad is one of the best shows I've ever seen and definitely merits repeated viewing.
B0071QIN00|3.0|game is good but lots of bugs with collisions, game buttons and sometimes even checkpoint resets to instant dead makes it very frustrating.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is a blast! easy to control and lots of levels to play. I got it free, but would have paid for it!
0375701427|5.0|The novel's denouement is the cardio equivalent of an advanced Spinning class at the gym.  This is my first Philip Roth novel...it will not be my last.
386521584X|5.0|Robert Frank shared his personal vision of America in his groundbreaking book \\"The Americans\\". It's not my vision nor yours, and that's the point.<br /><br />What Frank did was make it OK for anyone with a 35mm camera, a pocket full of Tri-X and an eye, to express their opinion through photography. Until Frank came along you (basically) had two schools of photography. One tried to mimic paintings, whereas the other claimed the camera didn't lie. Frank proved both schools wrong. He expressed his opinion in an artistic way without manipulating his subject matter.<br /><br />The images are all about what HE saw in America and how HE saw it.  A radical concept back then which seems only natural today... thanks to Frank.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is awesome but a little challenging it is so very cool my favorite is the udder 1 it is great a bunch of people should try it I have a little brother and he loves the game so much cant get enough of it so cool thanks for creating bag it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#1
B005GP7F8Y|1.0|Shame on the makers of this blue ray DVD. Why would they dare release a lousy copy of this excellent Western
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The game is great for variety.  There are many games on top ofit being free...that's a wow factor. Its a great way to past time, though some games are challenging.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Overall i am quite happy with this purchase.  The design on the back looks really nice too.  If u are looking for a clear case that is going to protect your phone when you drop it, this is the one.  It is a soft/hard plastic material thats going to offer some cushion upon impact instead of breaking the case like a hard plastic case would.  The Bad:  -the case is a little tough to put on and take off.  Also if you take it off and put it back on a lot, you'll start to notice that the sides wont fit as snugly as they once did.  -this case offers little to no screen protection, just sides and back.  Conclusion:  -Awesome clear soft case with a sweet design on the back  -the price is just right  -a little tough to put it on and take it off  -offers good protection for your iphone
B006ON41FC|1.0|I already hate any app that includes stupid piece of crap Open Feint, so just including it at all is an instant fail. While this is a good game, it actually FORCES you to use Open Feint and that is just inexcusable! I refuse to have any app on my HTC Thunderbolt that REQUIRES stupid piece of crap Open Feint. I hope the creators of Open Feint choke on a tater tot and die tragically, because I HATE OPEN FEINT!!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this app!!! It's very addicting and a great time killer...especially if you enjoy strategy games. Runs really well on the Kindle Fire and I would most definately 100% recommend this app! :D
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my daughter loves this game.  we have unlocked a lot of the minigames. so much fun to share the game with her.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I hate this game the screen just goes black when I try to play it please help me find a way to make it work
B001KOFH2G|4.0|If you are a Firefly fan then this is a must have film.  Great in HD on the space scenes.  Good acting and give the Firefly series closure.
B0055SWM08|1.0|i hate hate hate hate this game it is the worst game you could possibly play in you whole entire life
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I really liked this film but I am a Harrison Ford fan from Indiana Jones and this film has the same feel.  The film also reminds me a little of Tremors.  A little to much for young children.
B006ON41FC|5.0|the entire family will love this game (my 5 and 10 yr old love it) it is very entertaining. my husband and I both are addicted. very challenging.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is tons of fun. who cares if it connects to openfeint? graphics are awesome. for those of u that cant seem to turn off sound, pause and touch the speaker....
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game sooooooo freaking much!!!! I'm always playing it, in class, at home, everywhere!!! =] I'm not sure what's so interesting about it, all your doing is putting groceries in a bag! Bet yet, I'm still addicted!
B005DOKIYG|3.0|This cover works pretty well for minimum protection while carrying my Kindle Fire around in my bag.  If it were just a trifle larger, maybe an eighth to a quarter inch, it would zip close a tad easier.  I like that it's available in assorted colors.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I ordered the trilogy on the 8't of Feb. Didn't start reading it until the 12'th and could not put it down.  Finished it early on the 17'th.  Great, grabbed my interest from the first page.  No boring spaces at all.  I heartily recommend it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|its fun to play. new favorite app. you can play it anywhere on the fire since it wortks good. almost like temple run in a way.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I just downloaded this game today and I just can't seem to put it down. Awesome game and very very addicting. I would recommend it to my friends.
B005HSL626|4.0|i love this game but now when i try to pull it up on my kindle it goes straight back to home...it sucks
0446547654|2.0|If you've read any of my previous reviews, you know I'm a big fan of Nicholas Sparks.  Even in his weakest books, I've managed to find something positive to say.  Unfortunately, that's not the case with THE BEST OF ME.  I don't know what's happening.  I wasn't impressed with last years book, and was so hopeful that this year would better.  Instead, it went the opposite direction, and was even worse.  The book just seemed to be all over the place, especially the last third.  I couldn't even follow who was who, where they were or what they had to do with the story.  I never felt we got enough of Amanda and Dawson's backstory to care about them as a couple.  How can the main characters have rooting value, if you don't even know who they are?  The story seemed to be inspired by BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, as there were many similarities.  It was very predictiable.  There was no suspense,  I knew how it would end before I was halfway through.  I usually can't get enough of Nicholas Sparks, staying up late and reading his books rather quickly.  This one took me three months to finish.  The last part of the book was so much of a mish mash of goings on, that I skimmed over most of it, just to get to the end.  I miss the Nicholas Sparks who wrote THE NOTEBOOK and MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE and THE WEDDING, even THREE WEEKS WITH MY BROTHER.  If these last two books are the type of stories we can expect from now on, my collection of Nicholas Sparks may have just ended with this one (I still own every one of his books in hardcover format, haven bought all of them on the day they were released (except for THE NOTEBOOK and MESSAGE since thats where I started after reading several positive reviews)). I don't know if he's run out of ideas or if he's trying to take his books in a new direction, but for me, it's not working and it seems like he's lost some of that spark that made him so popular in the first place.  Maybe he needs to go back and read his earlier works again in order to be inspired to write the kinds of stories his fans love so much.  I miss those stories and the connection to the characters.  This book was so bad, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone - not even the most diehard of Nicholas Sparks fans, and it pains me to say that.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It really has it all: great graphics; good score; challenging levels and designs, and all for a bargain price. This has easily become my favorite game. Please Make More.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A great book about a great innovator and businessman. The book is a biography of the iconic Steve Jobs who singlehandely, mostly, created the entire computer industry, revolutionized music, advanced computer animation for motion pictures and built one of the most successful companies on earth. Unfortunately, Jobs suffered an early death before he could revolutionize other areas in desperate need of new operating systems, education and medicine to name two. Jobs was brilliant, ruthless and tortured. I spent most of the book trying to figure out what his basic psychiatric problem was and came up with bipolar disorder. He goes from lambasting employees to crying on numerous occasions.  In any case, the book was well written. It gives a grand tour of the origins of the computer industry. It details the way Apple was created in his garage. The most fascinating tidbit was that early on in the formation of the company a person bought 10% of the company for something like $1500 and took his money back and sold his stake eleven days later. Ouch!! that was a $2.6 billion mistake!!!
0553582038|2.0|Just got around to reading this book.  I'm about half way through and have to say I'm pretty disappointed!  Reading through the minutia of everyday life and what people are wearing or what their hair looks like, or what the warts on their nose looks like, etc. in this book reminds me of the fluff that Robert Jordan added to his books.  Or maybe more like David Weber with pointless, achingly long meetings and discussions about, well not much.  It is ridiculous to read eight to ten pages of Cercei's meetings and clothes that everyone is wearing.  Reading five pages of a description and history of a character who will likely never show up again in the series is obviously Mr. Martin trying to reach some arbitrary (or maybe required by his publisher) word limit.  And then a couple chapters later here comes another character that we have a back-story and again we all know we'll never read about tehm again!  Reading through 20 ship names of all of the Iron Fleet (and their descriptions and their captains and their family histories), then 20 pages later through the names of the ships in Stannis' fleet, then the fleet in Kings Landing in the next chapter - again just trying to fluff up the book.  Did he REALLY need to write an entire chapter about Sam's seasickness?  The entire chapter and the only thing new we learn in it is who the child is that Gilly brought!  Nothing on the main characters in the book (except in brief passing) namely: Jon, Bran, Rickon (he seems totally forgotten in the series!), Daenerys, the Wildlings settling in the Gift (except in a one line mention), Stannis, the Others (weren't they just a few days north of the Wall at Craster's in book 3?), the newly resurrected Lady Cat.  It took him four years to write this novel and Book 5 finally came out last summer - almost four years later!  Talk about losing interest.  It looks like he's not even interested in writing it anymore - except for the TV show now!  I really enjoyed the first three books in the series, but this one is a struggle to get through.  I'll give #5 a try, but if it is as disjointed and poorly thought out and wanders around without any coherent idea, it will be the last one in the series I read!
B006ON41FC|1.0|I have to agree with an earlier poster.  The game drops from 5 stars to 1 because it auto-opts you in with no indications. This is not ok.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Did anyone else find it creepy when Jace, the guy Clary is attracted to and makes out with is her BROTHER???!!! So wrong on so many levels! I was DISGUSTED when i found this out. I only finished the book in hope that they would say he was lying, but no, it didnt happen. Come on, that is practically incest. Until that point, the book was alright if not good. I was hooked atleast. there was action though it got a little slow at times. i liked that there was romance and it seemed like a solid romance, UNTIL IT TURNED INTO INCEST. Needless to say, i was unsatisfied with this book. Unless in the second book they say they were kidding and it was a lie, i do not plan to read it.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I bought Lost - Season 4 used. At first, I was concerned about purchasing used DVD's. But now, I'm glad I did. All of the DVD's played perfectly. This was an excellent value for a used product.
B005J29HCQ|3.0|Nobody is ever going to read all of these reviews so I figure I can just record my thoughts here, and if someone  stumbles upon it , so be  it.  Any Brian Wilson fan knows the history behind this album so no need to go into all that.  For, me the major problem with Smile is that it is too many incoherent pieces being attempted to be put together to create a whole. For the most part, it doesn't work for me. Put them altogether and you get a bit of an addled mess. Granted, there WAS genius at work here, but was Brian's work just too fragmented? Van Dyke Park's lyrics were just to \\"out there\\" to make a lot of sense, in most cases.  The strong points are that when there finally is a complete coherent song they are splendid. The harmony and purity of the Beach Boys young voices is, and will always be, an American treasure. I still think that \\"Surfs Up\\" is one of the most beautiful songs they ever recorded, perhaps second only to \\"God Only Knows\\". To hear it recreated from the original master tapes is quite a treat.  As far as the mix goes, there is just too much bass. It is very flat, boomy and harsh; it over powers a lot of the more subtle nuances. I found the best way to listen to it is to turn off my sub-woofer and reduce my bass setting down to almost nothing. This tends to make it sound a bit more like a late 60's recording. You simply could not get this much bass response back in the 60's and to try to emphasize it now doesn't work. The fact that they left it in mono is fantastic. That is how it was recorded, that is how it should be played back. That is why I can't figure out why they screwed the bass so much.  So all in all...I am glad that I own it, it is a great piece of music history but I don't think it is all that great of a successor to \\"Pet Sounds\\", as it was intended to be or that many reviewers claim that it is.  It is most definitely worth owning!  I think just too many things got in the way back then, and now; including time. Brian is in a much different place now (hopefully so much better!) and 50 years have gone by. I can only wonder if the current creation of Smile is just too far removed from that time and place and elapsed time has faded the memory of what he was trying to accomplish all those years ago. If I were able to personally thank Brian I certainly would! This is indeed a needed, missing part to his legacy and I am glad that it does now exist. I was just hoping it would have  been better.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|when I was a kid, I always liked angry birds, but now it begins to get boring boring boring..... this game isn'tv fun anymore..... wouldn't recommend
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Initially, I was very frustrated.  I destroyed about 20 wine bottles trying dipping the scored bottles in hot water, then cold. Finally, I discovered a way that works a good percentage of the time.  Slowly pour hot water from a tea kettle on the score - rotating the score line around. Then run cold water on the score line. It works quite well in usually two rounds.
B004SDSSFY|2.0|The Documents to Go app installed easily on my Kindle Fire after I paid the 14.99 (NON-REFUNDABLE). I easily located my files on Google Docs after signing in with my Google username and password. Then I edited one of my Docs spreadsheets. I made a simple change to a value in a single cell and saved the change. Then I went to my PC and edited the sheet.  DISASTER!!! Documents to Go had changed row heights indiscriminately, deleted all my Pivot tables, deleted all my charts, lost all my Data Validation Rules, removed my Conditional Formatting rules, and worst of all, replaced most of my formulas with values. I have spent 3 hours reconstructing the damage done to my spreadsheet by Documents to Go. I gave it 2 stars because it was pretty easy to install, and SINCE I CAN'T RETURN IT, I'm hoping it will work on my Google Word documents without creating major chaos.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love it! Very convenient. Comfortable to use! Great support almost every where I have taken it. Highly recommend purchase and great price!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|The quality of the season 6 DVD's are very good for a TV series production. I was sorry to see the series come to an end, but I guess it had to happen sometime. At least I have all six seasons in my video collection now to view from time to time.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is addictive u can not stop playing this game you can also unlock crap with the nuts u get
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great fun for people who like to play games and for people who like to play games on their kindle or andriod
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of games to choose from so you'll never get bored with one game. it'll make you want to play all the games to get high points.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Seriously people, can nobody give an honest critique of an application without complaining about secondary issues?!  If you dis-like openFeint that much (as I do), just install \\"closeFeint\\" from Market and be done with it!  For all you people whose phone does not have closeFeint in the Market, you have my sympathy.  Anyway, back to the game review.  It is a decent game over-all with gorgeous graphics ,and an interesting take on the \\"collect and dodge while flying\\" genre.  The touch-screen controls take a little getting used to, and accelerometer control by default would have been more welcome.  That aside, it is a fun, simple game. The squirrel reminds me a bit of Rocky (for anybody who remembers Moose & Squirrel), though obviously not as anthropomorphic (no goggles or scarf). As stated above, get rid of openFeint, and it becomes 5 stars.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is fun and addicting and I love it if u don't have it get it you have to go as far as you can and get as many nuts as u can
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I have all 6 seasons of this DVD series. I purchased season 3 used (like new condition). This was an excellent value for a used item that plays flawlessly.

B004X2M3SI|5.0|This is my first review of Doctor Who. I must say that I was hesisant to start watching this series. I remember seeing some of the original series episodes when I was younger. I started watching the Torchwood series, and got hooked. In the episode of Torchwood when Martha Jones visits, I got curious. So I decided to start watching the new series of Doctor Who. I was completely amazed, and hooked from episode 1. I have now seen every episode of both Torchwood and Doctor Who multiple times. This is a fascinating show with great characters. It is a great science fiction show. You really get to know the characters well. I have laughed and cried so many times. It does keep you wanting more. I have to say that by far my favorite episodes were all of the ones that included Donna Noble. She is by far my favorite companion of the Doctor. Love, love , love Catherine Tate. If you are a fan, then you should really check out her sketch comedy show. The Catherine Tate Show. Amazing talented lady. I also have to say that David Tennant is my favorite Doctor. 5 stars.....
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|love love love love angry birds!!!!!!!!!!!! would love to see something like this game in water. like maybe fling sharks at peoples .. :)

B0019LY5IM|5.0|I have purchased all 6 seasons of this DVD series. The quality of the season 5 DVD's are very good considering that they are from a TV series and not a movie production.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is very thrilling and blood pumping if you want to experience the joy of flying as a squirrel this is defnitaly your game
B006ON41FC|1.0|The game is great but it bugs you to rate over and over. Don't spam me! Also game lags with feint on droid bionic. no reason for this!

B006ON41FC|1.0|If it is required I won't download or play the game. Hopefully no one else will either. Download something else.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I have all 6 seasons of this DVD series. I purchased season 2 used (very good condition). This was an excellent value for a used item that plays flawlessly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a great game to kill some time if ur ever  waiting on something...games are a lil challenging also takes a lil bit to understand them at.time.
B0030T0VGG|5.0|I love Schleich toys, I started getting these toys for my daughter when she was born, she now has hundreds. the are tough, well painted and beautiful. She makes great worlds and they are fun for the entire family. these are the kind of toys that will last generations. The entire family knows more animal names and where they live, they spark conversation about wild life conservation.  As with all well made things they are expensive.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so nice to be able to pull up any verse and get related verses so easily.  This is great to use in my Bible study.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is a lot of fun. It has tons of games to challenge you. Everyone should get this app and its free
1594203334|4.0|I have to say as a new mom, I hesitated buying parenting books because I did not want to be overwhelmed.  My husband actually read the article in the Wall Street Journal and I thought it might make for great conversation for us to discuss parenting and how we handles situations as they arise. Our values are set in what is important for us and our family, but we are open to learning from others.  We are new to this and enjoying our almost one year old daughter, but it never hurts to hear other view points. Just two weeks before the article came out, my hubby mentioned the american way of raising kids can not be the only way. I read the Tiger Mom book and although I thought she was extreme,I appreciated her commitment as a parent. She loves her kids. Pamela Druckerman strikes me a bit differently. She does a great job of explaining not only her own insecurities, anxieties as a mom but also is humble enough not to assume, her view is the only way things must be with children.  The one extremely negative reviewer who wrote that she wrote about her having a threesome sounded angry. My sense is there is more to that review than we think. Yes, she has written and done some provocative things, but who am I to judge her. As a mother, I believe she writes with a true desire to understand and learn from other mothers. not sure what is wrong with that.  What did you do differently? How can I humble myself and learn? God bless her for having the talent to write and not be apologetic about capitalizing on her journey. As a now stay at home mom, I applaud her efforts. I am mid way through the book and some of the pointers I have to say are,yes common sense, but guess what as a new parent coming home with a new infant it would have been nice to read this sooner. Really wish my little lady slept through the night at 2-3 months.  Anxiety and nervousness as a new mother is human. I appreciate her candor and most of all the effort to write this piece. I wish more women would share fromother countries because I would love to learn. thank you Pamela Druckerman. Looking forward to second half of the book and any other mothers from around the world inclined to share their views.
B005ZUR724|3.0|amazon needs to update the file so we can access the game, gameloft updated the game.. i liked the character creation, but that's all i could do
B004MC8CA2|4.0|great Bible app easy to use. even my knefiews like using it with me. only down side is that you bee to have Internet access to use it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Can't imagine a better fit for our new Kindle Fire. Stylishly protects it in all the right ways. Firm backside, smooth front and felt screen cover. Couldn't ask for a better value.
B004ZJZQJC|5.0|I think I paid less than $6 for this blue ray combo pack that included the digital copy.  I used Itunes to download it and it's obnoxious how good it looks on my 4s.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app does everything that it should. i really like how the background Color of each note can be changed! very nicely made!
B005T87QCI|4.0|The game itself is amazing on a tablet - great graphics, fun and simple gameplay mechanics, and fluid combat make this homage to Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots a Steel for just 99&cent;!  HOWEVER, as good as it is, the game is missing the extras from the IPhone/ITOUCH/IPad version, like the downloadable robots and the championship arenas.  It'd also be nice to have a story mode and if possible, a robot creator with mix n' match parts, moveset, and color editor.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is so much fun, if you make an openfeint account, you barely even notice it! It makes you feel like you are really flying, and you can customize it! Best game ever! Although, I still prefer Angry Birds.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Well made, from the graphics to the music. This studio put out something really fun, challenging and super polished. Recommended
0547391005|5.0|My daughter and I love this book of Curious George stories. I remember some of them from when I was a child, too. The book also comes with 2 CDs of narration for all of the stories, which is wonderful for my daughter who is just learning to read.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I don't want to use Open Feint. Stop putting it on your games. There's no way they pay you enough to make it worth making potential customers this mad.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|eleventh dr. who screwdriver is better done than this one. so i wonder about that- but i love the tenth dr. so i bought this one too. by comparison this one is really small and kinda cheap plastic-y. the other one is plastic too, just feels so much better. They could have done a much better job. boo. keep looking for a better tenth dr. sonic screwdriver. this one costs too much for what you get.
145162445X|4.0|For some strange reason, I couldn't stand this book the 1st time through. However, once I gave it another chance, I really liked it. Easily 4 stars. I like the authors humor too. It was a really great read, & I'm glad I gave it a 2nd chance. I sure learned a lot about the cosmos, & now believe it may be possible to get something from the quantum fluctuations which take place in \\"empty space\\". It was an excellent book.[[ASIN:145162445X A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing]]
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I really like this game because of all the diffrerent mini games in it. however the first couple of games do seem to be too eaisly won.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game that encourages family fun without electronics!  It is not easy for a family to spend time today with out the use of electronics.  This is a great game to created interaction between young and old.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I am addicted to this game. Its fun and puzzling, not a lot of gaming apps catch my attention, but this one did.  I used to sack groceries when I was a teen, and this is a lot funnier than those days.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This a fun but mindless game, great for when stuck on the toilet or in a lobby with horrible music.
B006ON41FC|5.0|all you people who gave it a bad rating are idiots you do relise that there is a way to turn off open feint and you should rate the game for the game not that the developers put something in it that you don't like
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love it and my kids love it! very fun! Controls can be stiff sometimes but it's still very fun.
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun for a quick game between classes ;-p it takes a little while to get used to the flying controls. I would recommend this game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is an app you would play when your bored and in need to some entertainment. i found this entertaining, especially with the different types of nuts that give you different special powers... it reminds me a little of fruit ninjas, but not as frustrating.
B005DC68NI|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I've only read through chapter one. That chapter, I read from the free .pdf version that David made publicly available. You may ask, \\"why did he purchase the kindle version when he already has the .pdf?\\" The answer is because I wholeheartedly agree with everything I've read, and I wholeheartedly agree with supporting anyone who has done the work, learned the facts, and then gone through the trouble of creating a guide of that journey so that the rest of us don't have to dive into a world we may not understand.<br /><br />I cannot wait to put David's advice and knowledge to use in my own self-publishing project.
0312330537|5.0|This is the best semi-fiction or memoir book I've read in a long time.  It compares with Neal Stephenson's best like Snow Crash and the Diamond Age-- and it's not even science fiction, it might even be mostly a true story! There's no way he could have made up most of this, and from what we know of his bio, the author did experience an awful lot of what went on in this epic, with the emphasis on AWFUL. For better or worse it's clear this man has some real insight into the heart of darkness, the experience of having evil done to him, and of being the evildoer himeslf-- and of the spectacularly redemptive truths that emerge from such experience, from the brotherhoods of crime, of war, of poverty.  The sheer magnitude of Bombay's human ecosystem, I think-- the unbelievable concentration of all facets and levels of the human experience-- cannot be adequately communicated through documentary, through anything allegedly 'objective'. It's a subjective, visceral experience.  This book told me many things I'd suspected but not known, and I'm in awe of the courage and fortitude of many of his characters.  If they're not real, if they're composites, then I honor the real people who made up the material for the tapestry he wove.  I don't even like fiction or memoirs these days-- i stick mostly to work-related non-fiction-- but this broke right through, and it should for you too.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200, go read this book.  But only if you're ready for the ride.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is great I got the game without looking at the foments.I was like darn it. but I found out I love it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like this game, I even have the app on my phone, it helps me pass the time and makes my commute to work much easier.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Downloaded easily, but each time I have tried to open it, the app bumps me back to my home screen. Tried re-installing &amp; waiting a few days, but no luck so far. Hope it's a glitch that gets fixed soon.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I enjoyed this collection of Sherlock Holmes. The kindle version (that I own) has very little errors. If you want to read some Sherlock Holmes books, I recommend this.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Got this package on time, was neatly packed and brand new for a great price! I am very happy with this product.
1455830518|1.0|The CD is billed at being unabridged.  There were 3 discs.  It was  also confusing following the story.  One day I saw someone reading a copy of the book which was heavy and thick. I have no idea why this recording was so short and basically the first 3 chapters of 31 yet labeled unabridged. I got the book and am enjoying the 922 pags. Wish I wasn't too lazy to send back my CD.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|My kids and myself are really enjoying this app.  It is very fun and challenging!  Having it free was an added bonus but I would have paid for this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I liked this version of solitaire better than most. IWould recommend it to freinds and family, plies the price was right.
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun app. i like how the squirell flys. good time consuming fun and my little sister likes it. overall good app not horrible on battery life
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I dont know how may hours i have watsed on this game but its a lot and i still dont have all the golden eggs!
B006ON41FC|3.0|so far its a good game. it keeps my son and daughter quite occupied. got it free so its worth it.
0780622650|5.0|Was able to see this from new in the theatre to now. Just ordered the Blu-Ray to enjoy the superb graphics in the movie. From start to finish a wonderful followup to an interesting series when it was first on TV. For my part, any Sci-Fi fan should have this in their collection.
B006ON41FC|1.0|IF YOU WANT TO TRUST OPEN FEINT, FINE.  BUT DON'T COMPLAIN LATER ON!  HERE'S SOMETHING FOR YOU TO READ ABOUT WHILE YOU POST COMMENTS ON THE SAINTHOOD OF OPEN FEINT.  ANYONE WHO KNOWS OPEN FEINT FROM GAMING IS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THEM.  HAPPY READING TO ALL WHO ALREADY DOWNLOADED IT! :)  Apparently, I can't post the site here, it was deleted.  But court house news has it, and other sites.  Go look for yourself.  And it's pretty lame for this app to stop in the middle of gameplay and FORCE all the little 13-year-olds to REVIEW THE APP before they're allowed to continue playing the game.  NO WONDER there is an avalanche of 5 star reviews of little kids squealing with delight over acorns and nuts.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  First, yes.... Open Feint is included in this app, no way to opt out of it.  That alone killed this app.  Developers just don't get the message yet that Feint is poison to an app's rating.  I would, however, like to add (for those of you who may not know this) that an app that includes OPTIONAL OPEN FEINT does install the Feint folder onto you device whether you opted in OR out.  That is a whopping 2mb worth of data in that folder.  If you'd like to check for yourself, just go to the FILES folder on your device (the green folder icon).  Open that folder, and you will see all the junk Feint puts into your device EVEN IF YOU DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE.  Also, when first downloading/installing/opening an app, Feint may not show itself on the first opening.  Therefore, use the app for about 5 minutes (giving Feint the sneaky chance to load the files through the open network sockets), then CLOSE the app and REBOOT your device.  After rebooting, go back to the app, and open it again.  THEN use the app again for several minutes.  You may notice for the first time (even though it's your second opening of the app) that Feint FINALLY makes its presence known and either 1) asks you to participate (\\"have fun\\") OR then loads automatically (as in THIS app).  My point here is that Feint often makes its appearance after the SECOND LAUNCHING of the app, with a reboot of the device in between launchings.  If you think you can pull one over on Feint, and \\"long press/tap\\" the Feint folder of 2mb and then select delete, you're out of luck.  Because you have permitted open internet as a permission, all those Feint files in the folder will come right back into your device when you launch the app again.  Apparently, Feint knows you deleted it and becomes angry, then reconstitutes itself in retaliation for your efforts to ignore it and its capabilities.  Go into your files folder now, and you'll see it there even if you never once selected to participate in Feint.  Then try deleting it, and watch this arrogant social networking component do what it does best:  FORCE ITSELF DOWN YOUR THROAT.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app will periodically force close.  Then needs to be restarted.This is very frustrating when it has to be done repeatedly.)
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love it. No problems so far. Fast response to the touch of my fingers. I hightly recommended. great app
B006ON41FC|2.0|Don't like the mandatory openfeint and the actual flying of the squirrel is kind of non responsive.  That's a shame because this could be a great game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I think this game is fun..it is similar to temple run (which I love).  It did freeze my kindle once and I had to reboot though.  When I downloaded this game and opened the app it went straight to gameplay..never asked about or opened OpenFeint.  I cant believe so many people are WHINING about feint it's ridiculous.  Pick your battles people - it's amazing that an app (just because it has OpenFeint) can piss someone off that much. Did any of you actually play the game before you reviewed it?  Bunch of dummies. 5 stars.
B000B8QF14|5.0|A great CD/DVD combo of their show in England.  Definitely worth the money spent.  You won't regret this purchase.  kudos
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is very addictive! I've lost a lot of time playing this damn game! Very easy to play, and challenging as you increase throughout the game...

030771652X|5.0|In her twnety-six years, Bee has lost four family members. Her brother, Leo, died from cystic fibrosis at age eight. Then her father moved out. And most recently, her little sister, Tess, and nephew, Xavier, have died. Tess' death is ruled a homicide, the result of postpartum psychosis, exacerbated by Xavier being stillborn. Bee is convinced that Tess was murdered, and she embarks on an obsessive journey to catch the killer.  Bee knows everything about her sister, but she doesn't know her own self. She learns, through painful lessons, what she really wants and needs. Is it a career in graphic design? A marriage with Todd? Friendships with only the rich and sophisticated? Fancy clothing? A life in New York?  And, as she figures herself out, Bee comes to terms with the circumstances of her sister's death.  The novel is poetic and hynotic. Suspenseful until the end, interlaced with various characters, some more fleeting than others (Pretty Witch, Benjamin). Each character, regardless of their time spent on the pages, creates a very real-life feel to the story. Hattie, who is introduced towards the end, is a crucial piece of the puzzle. Pretty Witch and Benjamin are classmates of Tess, and their short time on the pages remind us of Tess as a free-spirited art student.  If you're looking for something new, especially free a new author, Sister is the book.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|i loved the first book. I also enjoyed the second. i found this one to be the worst. i was really disapionted.
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaire is pretty basic but as solitaire goes its good. great options, easy to use, and I love auto complete function.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|Just bought this for my 2 year old for his birthday.  He loves it!  Hes still pretty small and his feet can't reach the floor to move around but he rests them on the grey part right between the wheels.  I would recommend this for a large 2 year old or a very coordinated one.  My little guy has his brother and sisters helping him scoot around. This toy will only get more use as he grows.  The little black exhaust pipe will fall off but my kids had no problem poking it back in it almost adds another learning element to this toy.  Great learning toy better than expected.
0061733199|5.0|A very good book to learn survival techniques, hopefully you will never need them in a real situation. However, many of the things described in the book can be used in non-survival situations, just for the fun of it!

0525478817|5.0|I probably shouldn't have read this book, a sibling has leukemia, and  it hit a bit close to home. However, it is incredibly well written and I enjoyed every page,  despite the tears. Don't dismiss this due to the \\"young adult\\" label, it traverses age. Loved it. Word of advice, don't read on a plane...or in public in general.  You just fall in love with Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace...thank you for this this little infinity.  This will be a hard back copy I keep forever.

B0062NAVXA|1.0|Avoid ultraviolet digital copies, they are more trouble than they are worth. Purchase a version without a UV digital copy. Their customer service is terrible.
2061011306|5.0|The maps came exactly as listed and were also shipped very quickly. I would purchase from this seller again. The price was excellent...I ended up buying 2 different maps for my family and I to pin the places we have lived.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I used this product when I replaced the CPU cooling fan in my desk top computer. The product gave me a computer site where I could select my particular CPU and get exact instructions for using the product with my CPU. The product worked excellent and was easy to use. In conjunction with a high quality new fan, my computer has gone from not working after being noisy for months to operating like new and is totally silent. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs to transfer heat between a CPU and its heat sink. Did I mention that it came early, was inexpensive and there's enough for at least two applications, maybe three. It's great!

B003Y5H5HY|1.0|Avoid ultraviolet digital copies, they are more trouble than they are worth. Purchase a version without a UV digital copy. Their customer service is terrible.<br />This is a fantastic movie.  It is a great adaptation of the book and brings Salinder more to the center of the story, something I felt was lacking in the Swedish version.<br />I am sorry to give this great film one star, but I have been ignored by Flixster customer service and hope someone at UV will read this and see how angry they are making some of their customers.<br />Really, buy a version without UV digital copy.  It's a great movie.  Don't let the digital copy anger you like it has me.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love the challenging game play on my galaxy s2. Well thought out and expansive levels will keep you hooked on it.
B00664AM5C|1.0|This isn't a review of the movie but a review of the info provided by Amazon. I bought this bluray copy after I did an advanced search on Amazon for movies subtitled in Asian languages. However, when I got this copy the back cover clearly indicated that it was only subtitled in English, French and Spanish. Now I have to go through all the hassle of returning this bluray. THANK GOD I didn't just open it and pop it in the bluray player like I did with some other movies I purchased from Amazon (which Amazon also provided the wrong information for) because then I would just be stuck with this bluray too. PLUS this bluray didn't have the white seal on the top like most blurays usually have, leading me to think that maybe Amazon just sent me an old or used copy and that's why the bluray doesn't match the info provided by Amazon. Seriously... very very annoyed.
0439023513|3.0|Having very much enjoyed the first two books in the Hunger Games triolgy, I was really excited to finish the series.  I'm normally a fairly slow reader, but read the other two books in mere days because I couldn't put them down.  Mockingjay failed to deliver that same spirit of urgency.  For a book that houses the culmination of a rebellion that involves the common people overthrowing a government that has oppressed and abused them for over seventy-five years, it manages to be extremely anti-climactic and lacking in significant action.  I was rather saddened to see such a decline from the two earlier books.  ***Spolier Alert***  What most disappointed me was the way Collins just grazes over some of the most significant moments in the story.  There are entire paragraphs detailing how Katniss plays a game with Buttercup and a flashlight, but when it comes to the actual victory of the rebellion over the Capitol, or just how Peeta overcame his hijacking, or why Katniss shoots Coin, or why she even voted to have another Hunger Games, there is a measly summary or no explanation at all.  I was anticipating a fantastic scene where the rebels offically overpower the Capitol, where we see Snow finally defeated, and it was simply not there.  Instead, there are a couple of brief, unemotional lines that brush over the fact that the rebellion was successful and how things are different now.  There is so much time (and so many pages) spent on seemingly nothing, and when it comes down to what ought to be a burning conclusion, it doesn't even manage to spark.  That being said, what I did appreciate about the book was the way Katniss is portrayed.  I never particularly warmed to her, but I appreciate her as a character, someone more realistic than most 'heroines' in teen fiction.  Katniss is completely selfish, she runs on pure survival instinct, she goes through the whole teen angst thing over the two men in her life but she's able to see their flaws.  She is truly a product of herenvironment.  I was impressed by how clearly Collins portrayed Katniss as a victim of post-traumatic stress disorder: the way she thinks and views things, the way her thoughts and feelings aren't always quite where a reader would expect them to be.  Katniss comes off terribly cold; she calls her own children 'the boy' and 'the girl' at the end of the story and it shows how, unlike most fictional stories where the main character grows and moves on, stronger and better for the experience, Katniss still suffers from what was done to her and what she was forced to do to others.  Overall, Mockingjay was worth trudging through so that I could see how it all ended, but I was really disappointed with it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I LOVE this game...!!!!! its so AWESOME....!!!!! Please I reccomded this game for my 4 year old cousin.. Angry Birds need to get more apps...!!!
B006QLH7O4|1.0|Avoid ultraviolet digital copies, they are more trouble than they are worth. Purchase a version without a UV digital copy. Their customer service is terrible.
B006MQRLSA|5.0|Understated. Perfectly pitched. Every moment of the movie is compelling and believable. Hits the ball out of the park. If anything, the tension and combat in the offices is even more interesting than what happens in the field.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|This is a very good game but I am stuck on Lvl  15 and I tried everyway if I could get pass it it would have been 5 stars.
B006VREOOY|4.0|Plot had some good twists and not just the usual shoot them up. I won't go into the plot details but this is partly based on true events and involves alot of politics of middle east oil back in the 70's and 80's. Pretty good overall.
B000WC3AGM|5.0|I recently purchased this giftset for my high school senior daughter as a gift. Her high school recently did the Hair Spray musical and she was cast as the lead (Tracey). i am so proud of her and wanted to give her something other than flowers that other people presented her with. She absolutely loves it. I love the quality of the items in the giftset.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|I have emailed flixter several times since the beginning of the year and no response.  I will therefore try to make my voice heard here.  Avoid any ultraviolet product like the plague.  Difficult to use and terrible customer support.
B006ON41FC|5.0|open feint doesn't do anything its a very fun game. awesome hardish  game but still fun. i dont know why every one only gives it 1 star
B002BWP49M|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie as much as the others. :) I am looking forward to the part 2 this fall and will again add it to my bluray Twilight collection when it comes out on dvd.
B006VR65OQ|3.0|I follow baseball and aware of the concept here but I found this movie lacking something. Whether it was little more depth of why this is important or maybe more details on the process. All we saw is 1 idea, 1 manager who made the change and a bunch of old timers who didn't want to change. All that's based on 20 game winning streak. I would have really liked more details about it, just on base % is not all of it. I think acting was fine, just script came up short.
0307266303|5.0|Years ago, I read a book about a guy who goes to live with the Yanomami in Brazil, and he casually mentioned that they would run all day, and that he would run with them. What? It was never explained how these people could run these distances, and how he could magically start doing the same. I always wondered about that, and now I know the answer! I loved this book. It was woven together so nicely. There were some parts that didn't quite make sense to me, however. In the beginning, to meet the natives, the author has a guide with a truck who takes him over ridiculously harsh terrain, and then they perilously hike down into the canyon, risking their necks. Then, when the group of Americans goes down for the race, they wake up in an American hotel, take a bus down the canyon, and are there in a matter of hours. Huh? There were a few confusing things like this in the book. But the story and excellent writing and amazing characters and astounding scientific revelations more than make up for that. I would recommend this book to anyone! (Well, anyone who doesn't read the National Enquirer.)
B004EPZ06G|1.0|Ultraviolet digital copies are more trouble than they are worth.<br />That being said, this movie was terrible.  It took everything that was funny about the first one and pushed it too far.  The original movie was very funny, but this one was just gross.  It was like hearing a joke being retold by someone who can't tell jokes.  One star.
B005T87QCI|5.0|this game is really really good the controls are easy graphics pretty. good also the movie co insides. with the movie but the only bad thing is no atom (robot from the movie) also another good thing is you can play it with no wi ti so play it wherever. you go.. so I rate it 5 stars
B000ZM1FXO|2.0|I saw this film in all of its forms from the time it was first released in NYC as a rated XXXX film in 78' to the tamer version of this one here in 79'.  Trust me when I say that the unrated/xxx version is the only version to see. I am a very prudish viewer to begin with. There is way too much detail to miss in this R rated version. In today's standards, It is not such a big deal.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Game would be 3 stars if open feint didn't automatically connect. Graphics are OK, controls are meh ... Definitely some padding going on with false 5 star reviews.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Mobile Systems has done a great job with this. The word processor does most of what you might need to do, including comments, footnotes, and endnotes. (It doesn't handle text boxes well when they show up in other documents.) There is recovery for if the power goes out. Outlining is fine.  I didn't use the spreadsheet much, so can't speak to it.  The presentation module is the weakest: you can only edit in outline mode, and the editor is very weak there (no cursor, no selections). But if you create the slides on a Windows machine or Mac, you can at least change the text before you present it. You can create a slide show from scratch.  One especially nice feature is that it works well with not only Google Docs but also DropBox and Box. This integration is **VERY** welcome.  I got it for free when Amazon was offering it as a free app. I notice that the price is $9.99 now--I would certainly pay that for such a great app!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Ok folks, this is a truly amazing app. Lag free, cool game objective, nice graphics, plus, its free! You can buy clothes and gear in the in-game store. Over all, amazing.
B0011B9FNK|4.0|Viewers are lead down many different paths even to suspect the hero of being behind an assassination.  Previous story-lines converge to create a condensed thriller of an episode with many satisfying twists and turns.  Sen. Kinsey and the NID are back, as well as some insidious alien technology that seemingly would pose a threat to the basic integrity of the US system of government.  Sam, Teal'c and Jonas are sent to find out who is behind the assassination.  The three heros want to know what means the perpetrators used to kill Kinsey and to frame O'Neill for the murder.  The question of whether O'Neill is guilty is dispelled shortly after the opening credits.  So no time is wasted building suspense in that area.  Instead, the suspense derives from the moot point of proving O'Neill's innocence to the public without the possibility of revealing the Stargate program and all those wacky goings on under Mount Cheyenne (go ahead and quibble with the name).  The conclusion is satisfying and not entirely expected.  We know the fixed cast is not in jeopardy, but the surrounding guest cast is.  Another question is will these lovable allies survive the struggle to expose the evil doers?  Find out by watching it!  Recommended for fans as a few past plots converge here.
B0001ARCFA|1.0|i have had these for less than 3 months, and yesterday they seemed to have blown out. i can hear instruments and bass and some instrumentals, but vocals or voices in movies in videos are barely audible. Seems like these headphones should have lasted quite a bit longer, and they don't have anyway of contacting them for a replacement. The music i was listening to when i first noticed this issue was not even particularly loud and i was not using a headphone amp so i don't see how this could have happened.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|I'm working on my dissertation -- which means long hours of sitting and thinking as well as long hours of typing and coding.  This music is a god-send right now!  Don't get me wrong -- I enjoy this kind of music in its own right and this album is a solid example.  I don't mean to diminish the various musicians' accomplishments and effort by saying that it's great to have on \\"in the background\\" while working, but ... it's GREAT to have on in the background while working!  I listen to a lot of classical music while at the computer too, and it's nice to have other styles of instrumental music to ponder to.  I could do without the very last song (\\"Is Your Love Strong Enough,\\" as performed by How to Destroy Angels), but other than that Reznor & Ross have created a great soundscape.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best app in the world it is so cool so many cool games in one isn't that cool
B0011B9FIK|4.0|You want to know how this episode plays out.  From Teal'c's early long gaze at the forest the viewers are kept in tow as the events roll on.  There is suspicion.  There is deception.  And there are questions for the castaways and their foe in the brush.  The achievement of this episode isn't in the intensity of animated explosions.  It is in wrapping the heroes up in a simple struggle to solve a puzzle of strangers in a strange world and see the whole picture for themselves before the lives of friends are lost.  Gate fans must watch.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I'm using this X-grip with a gopro hero2 and it it works fine. Easy to hold, sturdy enough (for a gopro at least), I suppose if your camera was pretty heavy you might get a bit of flex in the handle. I did have to add a washer underneath the mounting bolt to get the camera to fit tightly, some others seem to have had the same issue but it's not a biggie. Not much else to say really, buy one.  PS. If you're planning on using this with a gopro you'll need to buy the tripod adapter.
B006ON41FC|5.0|my review for going nuts is that it is stupid and a littile fun because all you do is fly around.

B0011B9FJY|5.0|This is the funniest episode in all Stargate shows together.  The guest stars are very talented.  To see characters who are not as freakishly brave and lethal as SG-1 is refreshing--though the episode ends in that manner.

B00755646W|4.0|As a dedicated Madonna fan for the last 25+ years, once again I am left disappointed with another repackage/release.<br />Why did we have to wait so long for a blu-ray of Truth Or Dare for one, especially since this HD version has been playing on Palladia (TV Network) in the US for over two years.<br /><br />Ok fine, so we have to wait forever...could it be because \\"the powers that be\\" are working on making this an epic collection, especially since this documentary is 22 years old and M's fragrance of the same name is coming out at around the same time of this blu-ray release.  Nope! I was wrong.  The ONLY bonus is a trailer.<br />The VHS edition from 20 years ago even contained more bonuses -  2 extra performance videos from the Blond Ambition Show (I believe the full Like a Prayer and the full Hanky Panky).<br /><br />Honestly, in this day and age when media is so easily accessible and dvd/blu-ray/record sales are dropping, media companies should be working their tails off to get us dedicated fans to drop more money on a product that we have several versions of already.  I had the VHS edition, the DVD edition, and have the Palladia HD version sitting on my DVR as we speak.<br />Miramax/Lionsgate - Give us some bonus features!!  Nothing fancy, maybe all those outtakes from this documentary that are floating all over the internet, maybe some more performances.  We all know Alek shot the entire Blond Ambition show in HD.  Where is it?  The commercials that Madonna shot for MTV contests.  I mean there are so many opportunities here.  Oh and this time, I cant blame Warner Brothers.  Maybe its just Madonna/'s management.<br /><br />Aside from my rant, if you just want to see Madonna at the PINNACLE of her career, her most brazen, her most strong-willed, her most beautiful and the beginning of the most controversial era in her career, this is the documentary to watch.  Long before Lady Gaga (whom I absolutely adore), the queen of pop, was forcing us to expand our horizons, ask questions and taught us to show love and compassion and equal treatment for all and this is why she is a true legend.s, ask questions and taught us to show love and compassion and equal treatment for all and this is why she is a true legend.
B0011B5QYM|4.0|*SPOILERS*  The Tok'ra are my favorite good guys.  Too bad they weren't featured in Atlantis ever.  Here they come to the Tauri's aid in reversing the \\"cure\\" manufactured by another race of human's. They continue to be noble when they find out their founding queen is the source of the cure, has suffered greatly as a result, and is about to pay with her life.  \\"We thought we had found the cure for all disease, and now it may kill so many of us.\\"  I thought that was poignant.  It's the historical axiom of unintended consequences.  People deal with that trouble all the time in one form or another.  This isn't the usual run and gun episode.  Good episode for gate travelers.

B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Here is a film for the ages. What a performance by the incomparable Michael Shannon and newcomer Jessica Chastain. This is a film of one man's descent into mental adversity and his journey with others around him. Much credit goes to director Jeff Nichols and his superb direction with his written material and second collaboration with Shannon. How does one man handle a situation like this and how does it affect others abround him. A film of unrelenting suspense and accomplished editing. I was taken aback how the film never followed familiar plot lines and actually had a point. The ending of the film was a complete blow to the senses. Never before (in quite some time) has an ending satisfied me like this did. What a tribute to love, honor, family and understanding.
030726999X|5.0|All good things must come to an end!  This was a wonderful trilogy; each book just kept getting better as one reads each novel.  Certainly, one could say that this one was better than that one and quibble over details, plot or characterization; however, this was one of the best and most enjoyable series of books I have read in many years. Personally, my favorite was the second: \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire.\\"  Still, I loved them all and each of the books individually is a 5 star book!  Certainly, there were some serious and disturbing sections in all of the books, so if language or graphic violent or sexual parts do disturb you, than I would say, don't read them. I too was certainly \\"disturbed\\" by parts of the series, yet these books and their characters gave me many enjoyable hours of being caught up in the suspense and trials and tribulations of the \\"girl won't come back,\\" at least not but Stieg Larsson, who is sadly deceased.  Yes, I would have enjoyed continuing the saga of Lisbeth Salander and seeing where Lisbeth ends up and what she would do next. I thought her \\"twin\\" would play a greater part in the series or the finale at least. Certainly Mikael Blomkvist can trip over something else in which he will need Lisbeth's help.<br /><br />Although I perhaps liked the \\"Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" least  (recall I still gave it 5 stars), it kept me turning pages.  The \\"Hornet's Nest\\" is essentially a continuation of the second book, \\"Played with Fire.\\"  I would recommend that one reads them in order; at least, one must read two and then three because of the continuation factor mentioned above.  The \\"Hornet's Nest\\" picks up right where the last left off: the wounded Salander is now in intensive care in the hospital, the severely injured Mr. Z (her father) is being treated for his injuries inflicted by her just a few doors down the hall, Blomkvist and the magazine Millennium continue to support her and search for the truth, she is eventually smuggled in a handheld device giving our lady who never forgets a tool to travel throughout cyberspace and gain recruits who sleuth on her behalf in order to expose those who have made her life hellish and attempted to frame her for all manner of crimes. Half way through the book, I found myself rationing the chapters, deliberately slowing down and savoring each chapter, as I knew they were coming to a close.  I kept slowing down until I could not stand it any longer, and then just read the last 80 pages in one fell swoop.  When you reflectively sit back in your chair and know it is over and there is no more, you know you have read a wonderful book or series.  This was the same way I felt when I finished the last of the Harry Potter series, like a close friend has died, and you are holding close the memories.ce giving our lady who never forgets a tool to travel throughout cyberspace and gain recruits who sleuth on her behalf in order to expose those who have made her life hellish and attempted to frame her for all manner of crimes.

B005GFPZYK|3.0|\\"American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History\\" chronicles the exploits and life of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle during his deployment in Iraq.  The composition is written in the first person by Chris Kyle and is co-authored by Scott McEwen.  The writing is not complex and is a memoir; a diary of sorts, of Kyle's history from induction into the SEALS until his final discharge after four tours of duty.  Interspersed within the work is commentary from Chris's wife Taya that provides a unique insight about Chris from her perspective.  While there are various laments as to the quality of the writing, it seems generally to fit well with the commentary for which it speaks; somewhat of a personal conversation that you might expect if you were talking to Chris.  So from that perspective, I thought it to be satisfactory.  Like all electronic editions of written works, this one suffers from some grammatical and spelling errors.  They are not substantial, and while annoying do not appreciably detract from the reading experience.  Probably the most surprising aspect of the autobiography is the very distinct division of appreciation that is voiced by numerous reader reviews; it seems you either loved it or not, very little middle ground, no doubt the result of contemplation about the subject matter.  One thing was clear, however, regardless of the criticism or lack of it, everyone was appreciative of Chris's service to this country.  One thing that I perceived about the book and Chris's commentary is that the tone changed as the reader progressed to the conclusion.  In the beginning, at age 21, there was a definitive chest beating adolescent braggadocio that I would describe by these excerpts: \\"We're trained to go out and kill people. And then at the same time, we're also being taught to think of ourselves as invincible bad-asses.\\" \\"I was anxious for the battle to start. I wanted a target. I wanted to shoot someone.\\" Later, a much older Chris Kyleadmits: \\"I'm not the same guy I was when I first went to war. No one is. Before you're in combat, you have this innocence about you. Then, all of a sudden, you see this whole other side of life.\\" I discerned that many critical readers did not appreciate this aspect of Chris's \\"growing up\\" so to speak and harbored significant resentment; they missed an import message in the text I think.  While this was an autobiography of Chris Kyle, the excerpts attributable to his wife Taya, I thought, were especially poignant.  In many ways, Taya was as much a hero as her husband seemed to be, she bearing an unbelievable burden of playing third fiddle to Chris's peculiar take on the order of important things: God, Country and Family. That Taya persevered though all of Chris's challenges and kept the family together is a credit to a remarkable woman.  As to the sniper attributes to which the title of the book alludes, it is as much to Chris Kyle's admission that it was perhaps unremarkable. As he points out he seemed just particularly lucky; in the right place at the right time, and of course the record keeping didn't hurt.  So it was that perhaps Chris played down the particulars that would have formed the spine of a different book and soldier in a different war as some would have wished.  None the less, Chris Kyle's experiences were still captivating as was his recollection of the time he spent as a SEAL.  Overall I quite liked this novel.  It wasn't a memorable work by any means but it was an interesting look at life from the perspective of a soldier who admittedly loved his country only second to his God.  It is worth a reading and contemplation. I recommend you add this novel to your list.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me start out by saying that I didn't like the Twilight Trilogy. The books were awful and the movies were even worse. And yet, I still felt a pang of envy every time I saw someone get excited over Twilight. I wanted to be able to share in that excitement. I wanted to be excited about a trilogy like these people were. Well now, I am! The Hunger Games is a fantastic book. I read it in one night, didn't sleep at all, and I'm still so happy. I've just started on the second book of the series, Catching Fire, and I'm loving that one as well. I'm so happy to be able to be excited about a Trilogy. I'm excited about the Hunger Games movies to come out. I'm just plan excited about this book. Thank you, Suzanne Collins, for reviving my literary soul!

B004ZN9NCY|2.0|I would have to classify myself as a big Pink Floyd fan...thy have produced many classic rock songs that cannot be matched....but this album all feels like a not ready for prime time Floyd.  The first disc is not bad but just too much indulgence by the band without going anywhere.  Now the second disc....I am almost insulted by it.  You know how when you go into a modern art museum and look at something and think \\"my 3 year old could have done that\\"....except for Granchester Meadows most of the second disc falls in this category...random noise.  The only way you could possible like this stuff is if you are either very high on LSD or fooling yourself by saying to yourself \\"wow man that Pink Floyd is so far out!\\"

B002ZG99TK|3.0|While this movie did not blow me away, it kept my interest through and was made that much more interesting because it is based on a true story. Overall it feels like a bit of Speed 3: Speed on a Train so there is that lack of originality that I look for in movies these days. Worth watching but not buying.

Great actors, very good script and beautiful photography. This was an interesting well told story. The performers made it totally believable and challenged me to see true love in a very different way. Very well done.
1419702238|4.0|This book is FUNNY...and, compared to the previous installments in this series, very poorly-put-together. Unlike those others, there's next-to-no central plot in this one, just one vignette after another. By itself, that isn't really a bad thing, but it gives me the impression that Jeff Kinney just threw it all together as quickly as possible (more likely due to pressure from his publishers), which makes me a little concerned about the future of the Wimpy Kid series.<br /><br />All that stuff from the publisher's blurb? The blizzard? Gregory's \\"crime\\"? That's just the final of the vignettes (although, to be fair, it is considerably lengthier than the ones that came before it). Any of the other books would have built up to this crisis. Here, that's just not the case.<br /><br />Does that make this a bad book? Well, it makes it the sloppiest one in the series, but, no, it doesn't make it bad.<br /><br />The best way to go into this one is to ignore the series slogan, \\"a novel in cartoons\\", and view it as a \\"collection of short stories in cartoons\\". That way, you won't be let down by Cabin Fever's different feel.<br /><br />Like I said, it's got me a little concerned, but it's still worth a purchase.

B005AJTOFS|3.0|It is extremely annoying when a title is re-released in Blu-ray format with no restoration, or for that matter with no improvement on the image quality provided by the original DVD. Most films placed on Blu-ray stand out because of their crystal clear image and excellent sound. This makes it worth buying again, even if one possesses the original DVD copy, simply to have the improved performance on the screen, which may be even further enhanced by good quality equipment. This Blu-ray edition is far inferior to the original DVD edition, which used to have a number of interesting extras and the Blu-ray has absolutely none!  As to the film itself, in my opinion, it still rates as one of the best comedies ever to be produced for the cinema. A very clever story, by John Cheese, with tremendous dialogue and very good acting from all the principals. There are some exaggerations in the plot, but this is true of most comedies.  I noticed that the Blu-ray edition of this film will be released in the UK in August. I hope that after this long delay, this release will have the necessary improvements, especially in image quality, to make it worth a 5 star rating, and possibly induce one to acquire once more.

There's nothing I could recommend on this disk besides its Blu-ray video quality. However, I just watched Tosca with Placido Domingo and Raina Kabaivanska, and that version of Tosca was great! Those two singers were amazing! And the music was beautiful. And the setting and acting were just right. Tosca is as good as its hype on the right DVD...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|like it love it. fun to play. some are hard some are not. get and play it. play and get it.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|Great tie in, but wasn't the space shuttle above ground and filmed in the John Carpenter film? I heard bad things, but they were all wrong. It was a fun ride.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This app is pretty awesome. For a FAotD, it was well worth it. I would have gladly paid for it. Great job, guys.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|sweet games fun and time consuming lots to.do every.day a. new one and is endless fun. fun fun fun fun
B006ON41FC|1.0|So tired of Open Feint. I don't use it and never will, it's horrid. Since this game requires it, I promptly uninstalled. Open Feint is so fail why do developers use that?!?
B006ON41FC|1.0|First time this has ever happened, but this game downloaded but will not install. Phone is more than good enough, &amp; there is more than enough free space...odd.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I find myself wishing END Games would make this for the Kinect.  Simple game but I am reallyt enjoying it.
B004M3GDI4|3.0|Most Petzl headlamps including this one have the close-range beam that is too narrow to work or walk comfortably in the wild, I have to turn my head often to see something out of angle of the beam. On the movement mode, the angle of the focused beam is too low that if I adjust the close-range beam lower to see my feet, I cannot see the trail ahead , but if I adjust the focused beam higher to see the trail ahead, I cannot see my feet and be at risk of stepping on the snake that may crawl under my foot.  The color of light is rather blue that does not distinguish well between the twig and the snake.  The headband adjuster can press my head and causes a little pain if it is on the side of my head.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game very fun and challenging game. Best part is it's free. Beware of the Owls they will get you.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|Love Buddy Guy.  Good CD.  NOt as good as SWEET TEA CD but all in all this CD is really enjoyabe.
B006ON41FC|1.0|For the record I hate open feint. I don't know or care what it is I just know that if it comes on a game it makes the whole app stupidly laggy. I also HATE that anyone would be as arrogant as to make me click &quot;no I don't like having fun&quot; to not use there BS garbage. If any app developers are listening the minute I see an app has open feint I get angry both at open feint and that anyone would be stupid enough to think anyone wants that garbage. It reminds me of when you try to EXIT skype or aim and it gets minamized as tho the developer is saying to himself &quot;I see you accidentally tried to close our wonderfully program you Morin but we forgive you and its ok for your convience we have left it running minamized and it will still be running when you inevitably want to use it again&quot;. I don't like Open Feint, I never liked Open Feint, I don't want to try Open Feint please get over it an stop putting it into these otherwise alright apps.
B006ON41FC|4.0|everyone relax!!  you just click on open feint and click settings then click remove account. that aside, it's a cute game, good time waster...definitely worth the price today, free!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really fun and simple solitaire game. Easy to use and quite addictive. Card movements are fairly fluid. Has not crashed on me once.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is so easy to use. simple to find the exact chapter and verse in a quick time frame.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I downloaded this on a whim, and can't stop playing it.  The game play is kinda choppy when any other programs are running.  Make sure you end all other apps before you play...
006072448X|5.0|I bot it for my doughter, and she love the book.She as allowed the book to read to the girlfriend and the girlfriend too it was pleasant.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|super fun and helps my boredom at school!! love it very much!! their sediment arcade games for sure :) love to waste time on it
B004FOA84A|4.0|Game Play is quick and intuitive.  Graphics and Sound all great. Finished the game in 90 minutes which Is why I took 1 star off.  But, highly recommend!
B006ON41FC|1.0|Usually inclusion of the virus &quot;open feint&quot; earns an app a -1 star to what ever rating would be merited by the software. Automatic connection without permission earns the app an automatic one star rating.  Stop supporting apps that include open feint. Stop supporting devs that include open feint in their apps.  You do not need a game to post your high scores or let the world know exactly when you were playing a game.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|I've been a diehard Lacuna Coil fanboy for since 2008 and I've long considered [[ASIN:B00006RINF Comalies]] to be their best album. That album pales in comparison to Dark Adrenaline. The songs are beautifully written, every instrument masterfully played, and both Cristina and Andrea have left me in awe of their vocals. They even managed to perform an excellent cover of an REM song, which before now I thought was impossible.
1932100660|1.0|The entire book is based on<br />1. an observational study<br />2. a study of rats fed different amounts of protein and SUCROSE (sugar).<br /><br /> For one in depth critical anaylsis of this book, check out this link. (Im sure there are many others)<br />[...]
B0002IQAN6|5.0|Wow!  This SACD makes this album truly feel like you've got the original Allman Brothers playing in your living room.  It's not surround sound, it's 2.1 with the group right there on stage in front of you - 3D soundstaging.  The clarity is phenomenal and gets cleaner the louder you play it.  I can't gush enough over how much I appreciate this SACD.  Now I'm going to buy Eat a Peach and hope it's half as good as this one.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Even if you &quot;disable&quot; open feint it starts back up.  I don't want it to run.  When are you developers going to learn don't force this crap on us.  I have a new dual core phone and the open feint laggs out the game.  Good grief...
B005QN3ANK|5.0|The title says it all. I love all the songs. My Favorites: Playmate to Jesus, Kill Myself, Be My Saviour Tonight. I played this at work after we closed and just had a blast.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Addictive &amp; challenging. Works great on my incredible2. On par with angry birds without my toddler trying to pillfer my phone :D
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is so addicting. and im proud to say im an addict. everyone should own at.least one angry bird game 5/5
B004N62KTG|5.0|This has 4 great versions of the born this way on it.  I enjoy listening to it very much.  I was glad this song was put out like this, I didn't want to buy the whole album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game.  And I will mirror what the bulk of reviews praise this game for.  It is a well done quality game.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|yayyy this app is awesome there are so many different levels and there's one where you destroy as many items as you can also the groceries all have different relationships and attitudes
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! So many different kinds of games to play, and pass the time! It's fun for all ages!
1400069181|5.0|The book is written as if you've opened Blake's journal. It is extremely personal, something you rarely find in a traditional \\"business read\\". He offers candid insight into thoughts, relationships, and actions that were experienced along the road that lead to what we all know of TOMS today. But this is no ordinary business book. It is not over-done, it is not full of business jargon. There are no predictions of what the economy may or may not do and boasts no organization charts. It is simple and concise. That is why we loved it.  This book is uplifting, promoting the idea that doing work while living a fulfilled life is possible. Not one or the other. The principals set forth in the book promote a more sustainable existence. Don't we all want to enjoy each day of our life? Do something everyday that is meaningful? It's truly the business book for people looking to live and work consciously. He provides the reader with a clear set of principals such as face your fears, find your story, be resourceful without resources and keep it simple. Each of these principals are followed by realistic examples of how they have been applied either in his business or in other successful businesses he's encountered. Blake is mindful to also include writings from other successful social entrepreneurs. It is a constant reminder of how sharing and giving can bring smart, like-minded people together to create meaningful products and conquer problems.  Start Something That Matters provides lists of effective resources (pages 92-95 have been permanently dog-eared) that are low to virtually no costs for new businesses. We can back this first hand, as many of the resources suggested are actually ones we still use today. Most of all, he makes a great case for conscious capitalism. There are no limits for a One for One model in all fields of work. The creativity of how you can simultaneously make a living, give, and possibly solve a problem, is a great lesson.  This book is ideal for anyone who is thinking of starting a business or a non-profit with the idea to succeed with a triple bottom line in mind - Socially, Economically, Environmentally. It is also a great book for folks like us, young business owners who have already started out to do something that matters. It is a great sounding board for finding examples and reasoning that the decision of creating an alternative business model has great merit for the future of business around the world.  So join the movement, give a book and [[ASIN:1400069181 Start Something That Matters]]
B005HSL626|3.0|ive already played this app on my other aneroid before. nothing was changed with kindle version. I will rate it 3 stars.
B006ON41FC|4.0|this is an amazing little game for those times when you have a couple min to kill. but beyond passing it around between friend's there isn't many options concerning gameplay. For a free game I believe that its worth checking out. Playing on my kindle fire, it runs smooth with no nocticed lag. The graphics in this game are done quite well and not super cartoonie making it easy on the eyes. There are not many options as far as levels or any really cool outfits.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good games.  A like to have my kindle handy while I wait....at the Dr. office...at the post office.  Relieves the stress!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A dazzling jaunt through a lush and intoxicating landscape. Imaginative, ethereal, and lovely. Something about this circus stirs my soul and I would gladly wind through its tents and alleys, red scarfed and expectant, until the dawn forced me back out in to a world grown cold and drear.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Couldn't put it down, read it on my Kindle. Just started the second book Catching Fire hope its as good.
1451627289|5.0|I think Stephen King's new time-travel novel may not be his best but it's certainly worth a look. The book reminds me of \\"It,\\"  taking place in the same town and involving several of the same characters. Although it is unbelievably long, it's also filled with twists and turns, each more bizarre than the last, which keep you glued. Overall, I think it's well worth the read.
B006ON41FC|3.0|First, why does everyone hate openfeint?  Are any of you haters under 40? I think the game is pretty cool... not spectacular but it will entertain you for a bit.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this app, but the fact that they don't tell you right away about the directions is kind of annoying.  the games are addicting though, except sometimes it's hard to move the controllers.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie passed the 3peat test...I had to see it over and over again (and specific scene interactions between characters more)...surprisingly good good movie with  lots of laughs and emotion...definitely a chick film with plenty of bonding across social and cultural lines. Characterizations of the roles of women in the south during a very turbulent time in history was very WELL DONE...very good good movie...The women in this film did an extraordinary job...
030726999X|3.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is a more subdued version of its action-heavy predecessors, which to me is a great change. Although it's a tangled plot with a pretty far-fetched premise, Hornet's Nest is still a satisfying finale to Larsson's entertainingly suspenseful trilogy.
B0041KKYDI|3.0|I don't understand the hooplah of this movie, although it's watchable.  Would have been better in a more documentary form.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Wow!  This game is so addictive and entertaining and is a great time passer!  All in all, I give this game 5stars and a high recommendation.  no complaints.
B006ON41FC|4.0|fun to play with the kids ...not difficult for the little ones to pickup and play and play..so try it
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Fantasy based on what could be; less high fantasy, more high intrigue!  Be prepared to read for weeks on end, as it is a VERY long one.
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie was good. The family loved it. It was awesome and makes for a great night with popcorn some pop and candy.
B006ON41FC|4.0|the graphics are my only complaint. There is no point to this game at all but it is just way to addicting and thanks for the free of the day amazon.
0307891372|4.0|Arrived from Amazon in less than 48 hours. Would take 48 years to read it, this is a serious Gamer's Guide. The first thing I did was CAREFULLY remove the map and got it laminated in a matte finish. I really like the map. I keep the guide nearby while playing and I have increased my skill level alot faster, especially in alchemy related recipes. The paperback version is nice but it does want to slide around while trying to view pages. Not a big deal but i now see why a hardcover might be best for a book this size. Couldn't find these locally too often, some had used ones already but for the same price I got a brand new one delivered to my door! Thanks Amazon!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my favorite app on the kindle fire. Free cell is fun too, great ways to waste time :)
B0066W1AZK|3.0|being that its free its hard to criticize the lack of custimization. however, the design and layout is really favorable to other free chess games.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games are pretty fun but having to unlock each game gets tedious. Once you are spending 180,000 points per game it takes forever.
B006OT03BM|1.0|Already owned all 3 Transformers on blue ray but just got a new 3d tv and figured this would be a great set to have, only to find out the 3rd one is the ONLY one in 3d. Total ripoff and false advertisement. Im a huge Transformers fan and i feel this is a rip off and let down.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I got this so I could plug my SONY A700 camera into my ipad and download photos.  Woks beautifully and the price is right.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love it...really fun had a blast playing it and so did my kids!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its challenging and easy at the same time!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is great.  So far it is working flawlessly for me. I can connect to my laptop from the engineering labs and everything. It's great because then I don't have to lug around my books AND my laptop.  It really is coming in handy. Thanks for a great app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this on my phone and Kindle. I love the reading plans and always having God's Word with me.
0307891372|5.0|this was what i wanted and expected it to be and has been very helpful with my game play of skyrim
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Ignore the negative reviews saying this app is slow, or unnecessary on the Fire. Yes, the Fire can open PDF files without this app, but the native document reader is very limited in functions. The best part about this Adobe app, besides being FREE, is it's ability to quickly scroll through multi-page documents. I downloaded a 220 page instruction manual for a camera I own and scanning through it is a breeze using this app. On the native Kindle document reader, I was having to slowly flip pages. With the Adobe Reader, I can scroll vertically and it shows the page numbers as I go. If you prefer turning pages, you can also set it to do that. It also allows you to send a document via e-mail within the app and send it to Evernote, if you use that app as well. No need to re-install or move any PDF files you currently have on your Kindle Fire either, it automatically finds them and allows you to select them from within the application.
B0063IH60K|4.0|&quot;Winning Game&quot; is only available when you have signal.  Logically so, but I wanna win while on the subway! Overall, no complaints, never crashes or tweaks.

1423140591|5.0|Review Courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick and Dirty: The mythology-packed, humor-filled saga continues as known and new demigods fight to save the world from total destruction and chaos in the most recent installment that will leave the reader aching for more.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: The snake-haired ladies were starting to annoy Percy.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Rick Riordan's signature style is as strong as ever with this fast paced, humor and mythology packed, modern day continuation of the life of Percy Jackson, an Olympian demigod. It would stand to reason that most people who will read this book will have already read some of Riordan's previous works, and are familiar with the characters and plot already. Even so, The Son of Neptune is written so that anyone can pick up the novel, and not be thoroughly confused. Riordan's attention to fantastic detail and his acute execution of character development is real enough to make this book a truly enjoyable read.<br /><br />The novel opens with Percy running from monsters. As usual, he is barely keeping ahead by the skin of his teeth and pure talent, only this time he has no memory of who he is. The first book of the series, The Lost Hero, follows Jason who also loses his memory, ends up in Camp Half-Blood and finds out that Percy has been missing as well. Percy and Jason had been kidnapped and switched by Hera to help unite the children of the two aspects of the Olympian gods, the Greeks and the Romans to fight Gaia, aka Mother Earth. Back-story aside, Percy finds the Roman equivalent of Camp Half-Blood and gets the ball rolling with the whole quest-of-much-importance that happens pretty often for Percy. This time it is to free Death from the clutches of Gaia and her army who want to defeat the Olympian gods and take over the world, but be back in time for the Feast of Fortuna.<br /><br />The Son of Neptune introduces two new main characters to the cast of demigods, Hazel and Frank. Both have intriguing pasts that we find out over the course of the book, which is faster than other characters Riordan has wrote, such as Annabeth. Their relationship with each other and their new friend Percy grows closer over the short period of time as they escape almost certain death fairly often on their journey.<br /><br />I do agree that Rick Riordan often writes the same deathly peril, quick thinking and plan, fight, then escape scenarios, but I still enjoyed the book. If you like Rick's books, you will love this one. There are a lot of scenes and little details about the characters and plot, especially Hazel, whose past is now her present and only recently, came back to life.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book and cannot wait for the next installment, The Mark of Athena. The ending leaves you waiting on the edge of your seat for the reunion of Percy with Camp Half-Blood and Jason with Camp Jupiter and the ensuing battle with Mother Earth.<br /><br />The Heroes of Olympus Series:<br /><br />1. The Lost Hero<br /><br />2. The Son of Neptune<br /><br />3. The Mark of Athena<br /><br />FTC Advisory: Hyperion Books provided me with a copy of The Son of Neptune.

B005ZUR724|1.0|this app was going good for a week or so and I immediately got addicted. then a popup said I needed a update so I checked my apps to look for one but there wasn't any. the next day I uninstalled it from my device and try to reinstall it It wouldn't let me for another day. today it let me reinstall it but then when I got on my account and chose my character it sent me to the home screen. this happen the next 20 times I have tried but to no avail. gameloft needs to fix this or lose another customer that buys a lot of their apps.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I do agree with one of the reviews. Andy did a way better job as spartacus, but I do like the new season so far, because now I can focus on other characters that I neglected because of andys awesome acting skills haha He will be missed though :/ I dont like that some of the actors had been changed
0545265355|5.0|My life, now that Katniss isn't in it, feels lost. This series is amazing on every possible level; I could write a term paper on every detail - writing, creativity, relevance, morality, intelligence, character, twists, turns, action, heartbreak. I want to find Suzanne Collins and give her a hug, thanking her for reminding me how powerful a story can be.<br /><br />There is no reason in the world not to read this series, it's Lord of the Flies meets Brave New World and I hope this gets taught in school.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|Don't know about the rest of you, but I'm still waiting for a Conan movie. I've read all the paperbacks by R. Howard and the only things I recognize are some of characters names and him being born on battlefield. Just as good as other movies I've suffered through, but glad  I borrowed it before buying.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so.much I adeected to it everyone should try it so get your finger moving and press that button
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this Bible app.  The reading plans are very useful to help me stay in the Word on a daily basis in spite of my hectic life.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game, easy to follow and very entertaining. it lets you to continuously challenge yourself. recommend this game highly for all.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|what I love most about this Bible is the fact the read-to- you option. I haven't found a Bible app that I like more. my only request is that it be usuable when offline.
B006ON41FC|4.0|every time I play I always run into trees!!!  WHY!!!!!!!!!!!! :(  it makes me so mad!  its very fun though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I have it on all my devices that way I always have my Bible with me.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|What can you say Pink Floyd is the best group of all times and the cd comes out with all the base and fine background you would expect.  I like to sit in a dark room with a good set of earphones and drift away.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lot of fun need to get I play all day long fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B006ON41FC|1.0|I feel so sorry for the early adopters that installed this app, without realizing it was shoving Openfeint down their throats.  But at the same time, I'm very thankful they posted reviews to let the rest of us know about the imbedded Openfeint scourge.
0060899220|5.0|This is hilarious. Its so Bourdain! It does have afew curse words but you look past that. Very entertaining. It made my husband enjoy the kitchen more!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Don't listen to the whiners here. It's a great, lightweight cover to protect your Kindle. It does exactly what a protective cover should do. And it's simple to use. Not much else to say. Very happy with the product.
B0060ZJ78U|4.0|I purchased this movie for my husband. It had nothing to do with Brad Pitt being the main character. It was a really good movie, which was made from the accounts of a true story. I love baseball, as does my husband. We both really enjoyed the movie. My husband even purchased the e-book after viewing the  movie.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I really liked the mortal instruments but was a little dissapointed that they didn't measure up to the inferno devices!  I read the inferno devices first so I have to give this series less than 5 stars simply because it isn't as good but quite similar.  Clary and Jace are an interesting couple.  Despite knowing that their relationship is fundamentally wrong, I still really enjoyed the romantic aspect of this novel.  I would highly recommend all of Cassandra Clare's books to anyone seeking an entertaining novel.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I like that each level is a bit different. Fun for all ages.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A great way to read The Word.  All the different translations make this an enjoyable way to understand the Bible. Makes you want to read more and more since it enhances your comprehension!  Get  this app NOW!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|So cool its more fun than Angry Birds and Where's My Water? It makes you want to put your face up on the screen and say get the nut,get the nut! If you love it tell your aunt,tell you mom,tell you dog,you can even tell your squirrel that Going Nuts is the best game ever!!!!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|If you like a cool, sensual, and raspy sound, you will love Adele's titled album 21 CD. This album is for everyone of all ages. With a soulful jazz sound with the beats of modern music keeps the beat moving for everyone. Music written by her, that says the words of a heartbreak and the healing process, will help anyone going through a hard time. If you are not having a not so great day, pop in Adele's CD and you will soon feel way better. Her words relate to everyday stories and emotions felt by all. By that, this CD is really a I pity myself kind of day and I want someone to be in a pity party with me. It is a great feeling you get listening to her music and do feel better after a short 15 minutes! However, you will find yourself listening to this album over and over again. Singing in the car, and loudly at that, will happen to you! Do not worry though because her music is loved by all and you will find that they will start singing with you!  If you find yourself in a quiet conversation, ask about Adele! I am sure that the person would have heard of her. With non-explict language in her music, you do not have to worry about people being offended. Her emotions in her words are far more wise than her young 23 year old self really is.  Her way with words and notes magnetizes you to her. I find myself never turning the music channel in the car if her song comes on and also find myself craving her music! Her voice is so soothing that you just want her to come sing with you! If you do not enjoy her sauciness in songs, something has got to be wrong with you! Recently winning several Grammy's shows her true talent and passion for music.  Just listen to her music, you will not be disappointed!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|When I saw the title of the new Stephen King book; I knew I was going to like it.  Having been alive and living in the Washington D.C. area and meeting John F. Kennedy; I am intrigued with anything about the Kennedy's.  Having said that; I know it's fiction based on nonfiction events; but apparently there was a lot of research done for the writing of this book.  It keeps you glued to it from the start and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I loved \\"The Stand\\" and it was an equally large book. This goes to show that Stephen is a very versitile writer and can appeal to a wide variety of readers.  If I critized this book at all; I would say it would have been nice if he elaborated more on what happened to the world if the assasination hadn't taken place.  Purchase this book today; you won't be sorry you did!!!!!
B000VBP38C|1.0|IT TOOK A WHILE FOR ME TO GET THE MOVIE BUT IT FINALLY ARRIVED.  THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WHEN I SAW IT WAS THAT IT LOOKED A COPY AND TO TOP THINGS OFF IT DIDN'T WORK!!!!!  THEY SHOULD'VE AT LEAST SENT ME A WORKING COPY....LOL.... OH WELL I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR.

B0007WYCLY|5.0|I got this Monchhichi for my birthday from my son. My kids have bebechhichis that I love. I'm a child of the 80s, so of course. This large Monchhichi is great quality and is really cute. My kids think it's cute too. It's also very soft where is has fur and is very squishy in it's tummy area. It fits some of our clothes from Build-A-Bear so it can be dressed up.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is amazing! I first did it after another workout and thought it seemed hard because of that. But on day 2, I realized no, this DVD is some serious work. I'm sure with dedication you can shed it in 30 days, but I can't do this DVD everyday. My arms were sore from the weights but after getting used to it, I'm sure I can build up. All in all, you get what you pay for and if you put the work in, you'll get the results you want out.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|This is the Boss at his best, well except when he played with the sessions band.  London calling is just crazy good.  I highly recommend this to any person with brains.

086571701X|5.0|I really did not want to put this book down, but my eyes are too old to pull one of those college all-nighters anymore!  So I had to take two whole days cover to cover, but will be going back for refreshments several times over I'm sure.  This is truly a special book . . . well-organized, clearly written, and packed to the brim.  The scientific concepts are presented without \\"lab-speak\\", so there is no getting lost in jargon.  By the time you get to the last chapter you KNOW that you can do it!  And then you come to the appendices which are worth the purchase price in themselves.  Numerous online sites, forums, and sources are listed so you can seek more detail as you wish.  You won't go wrong with this purchase unless you are looking for a highly technical scientific dissertation-level piece of academia that gives you a headache.
1451627289|5.0|With 11/22/63 Stephen King offers a sentimental journey back in time chalked full of \\"what ifs\\" and moral dilemas regarding the idea of changing the past to create a better future. I was sucked into the story from the very beginning, and for the full 900+ pages I simply couldn't put it down. Like any classic King tale the characters come to life and become like your own friends (or enemies). You feel their goose bumps and your pulse rises and falls with theirs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it! top game for kindle fire! I could stay up for hours playing this game and getting bound points!
B006ON41FC|1.0|I didn't get this game yet when I noticed openfeint is mandatory. Openfeint is not trusted by myself so I am not installing. Usually there is an option but this? No thank you.  And it sounds like you can't turn the sound off. Poor options does not meet my standards. Sorry amazon.
0380730405|4.0|Rebecca, I have to admit, did not enchant me from the very first page. It took a number of chapters for the plot to kick in, but when it did, it was definitely worth the wait. What struck me most about Rebecca was its' writing. Du Maurier writes very, very well. Her writing is so descriptive and poetic, always. The story itself begins to unfold when the main protagonist is swept away from Monte Carlo, when ask by Maxim de Winter to marry him. She arrives at Manderley, finding it a mysterious place. There is a lot of mystery and suspense in this book, and a massive twist of events in the middle.<br />I had to read Rebecca for school, and at first i didn't like it, because it was very descriptive, with an un-exciting plot, which isn't a good mix, for me. But when the plot became so suspenseful, that you had to keep reading, one finds that the writing helps to complement the scene being described.<br />I'd recommend Rebecca to anyone ages 13 and up.<br />Give it a try, you're guaranteed to love it...
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is great. I really like the graphics! P.S. I got this game for FREE! (1 paid app for free a day thing)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Definitely the best puzzle piece on Kindle Fire! I got this game for FREE a couple days ago, thinking this might help many puzzle strategies. And of course it did! This game is a fun puzzle that you have to fill every bag of groceries without crushing them except for the crushing aisle. Might be a little tough, but worth it. You can unlock aisles along the way, and I didn't find any bad options or graphics. Pictures entertain kids, and I loved it too! Sure to provide good uses for the brain, and also the best I saw. Highly recommended!
0525478817|5.0|Like everyone is saying, this is Mr. Green's best novel yet. He gets into Hazel's head so perfectly. I was enthralled from the beginning to the end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a decently amusing game, perfect for short spurts or when u don't have a lot of time to play something more advance.  Some of the games are quite challenging.  Don't care.much for the point system, but it does give something to look forward to.
0920668372|5.0|My wife and I have three children, all adult now, and throughout their childhood we constantly read to them because we wanted them to be avid readers as we ourselves are.  We recently sifted through all of their childhood books, of which there are many.  \\"Love You Forever\\" is probably the most memorable of them all.  It is an original and profoundly touching narrative, beautifully illustrated, of the permanent and unconditional love of a parent for her or his child.  (Those who find \\"creepiness\\" in it are either concrete readers or need therapy for their unresolved personal issues).  As her child grows up, it is in her own mind and emotions that she continues to hold and embrace the child she brought into the world, as he and she pass through their respective stages of life.  The cycle of life is then completed in the beautiful conclusion that teaches young and not so young about the essence of life.  If this book is not in your children's library, then it is incomplete.
0439023521|5.0|After I read this book, I gave it to everyone I know! Exciting, great characters, can't wait for the movie!
B006ON41FC|1.0|No reason to download of you can not opt out of OpenFeint. Devs need to realize not all of us want to share what we do all the time.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is a lot of fun.  my son even enjoys it.  it has a great challenge to it.  works great on kindle fire.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, and I look Forward to any updates. Beautiful graphics, sound and OmNom is really cute!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evernote is like having another brain. best invention ever. it works with all of my devices so my thoughts are all synced in one happy place.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Despite the childish appearance, this game is fun. Every achievement is rewarding and fun to attain. I hope you enjoy =)
0143034901|5.0|This complex tale reminds of the old Dickens novels, and now is one of my favorites. I just finished re-reading this  and realize how much I missed the first time around. This is a read that is easy to get lost in.
B006ON41FC|5.0|When i first got this i thought it was going to be a boring game hut once i tried it it was fun
B006ON41FC|5.0|got it for free through the amazon store and its pretty fun. tips don't hit the green nuts and be careful with the red. owls are not your friend!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I was a bit off when listening to the previews.  Thought ... maybe the ol man lost a bit too much.  I was mistaken.  I bought on faith that the Bard was still there.  He is.  It is a great piece of work.  I need a smokey dark bar and this would be complete
0312641893|5.0|I will tell you the truth, I was slightly hesitant in reading this book. Sure, who doesn't like a good cinderella, but how many ways can you rewrite the same story. Well, was I ever wrong! The only thing I regret was not reading it the day it was released. It is a whole new story, with the tiniest hint of cinderella in it. Cyborgs, Magic, Wars, Plagues... lets just say this booked kept me aching for more, and I couldnt wait to finish it. Now I might possibly (rather probably) go stark raving mad with anticipation-waiting for the remainder of the books to be released:) For those of you who crave something new, and find it refreshing NOT to have a predictable love triangle, then this is the book for you.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I own a couple lowepro camera bags, and in my opinion, this is just as nice! I love this bag. It has plenty enough space, and I can even carry my tripod on my backpack too if I get in a crunch!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a great game that you can't put down! You start playing and your world is Bag It for that three minutes or so. You must get this fabulous game! Take my opinion, its great!
032147404X|5.0|I bought this book for my wife to help her out with her photography. Well, I decided to start reading it, and I must say... It is an amazing book! It is so easy to read... He makes it fun! Covers most topics that amateurs need to know! Quit reading my review and just click \\"add to cart!\\" haha
B00288KNJU|4.0|The first time I watched Coraline, I missed too much of the beginning, and just didn't get it.  Then my daughter wanted to watch it, so I sat down with her.  And I found myself really liking the spunky little lead character.  The storytelling is quirky but engaging; a little reminiscent of Tim Burton.  The animation is excellent, and it's nice to see a happy ending.  Oh, and the 3D version is a must, definitely worth the couple extra dollars.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I bought her second album first and I was afraid I would like this one as much, but its Adele, so I was not disappointed. Great!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Every time an app asks me to rate or review their app from within their app i always give it a one star review.  How good is it?  It doesn't matter because they are obviously more concerned about marketing than making a decent app.
0812550757|5.0|My fiancé had to work for three years to get me to read the Ender books. Once I picked up Ender's Game, I loved it and read it twice back-to-back. Then I moved on to Speaker for the Dead and was floored. I'm an avid reader, but have never been much of a science fiction fan. Then I fell head-over-heels for OSC because of this book.  You know when a book is so good you can't put it down? This book was so shocking that I had to, and I mean from a humanistic standpoint. There were two particular points, and I won't give any spoilers as to what they were, when I just had to step back for a few minutes and then reread a few pages. Had that really just happened? Unthinkable!  Card crafts deep, well-rounded characters and a story that screams for attention. He integrates ethical dilemmas into the story in a very organic way that really makes the reader question the characters' choices. True, it's not Ender's Game. There's less action and more dialogue, more brainwork that has to happen. As Ender has matured from that book to this, the subject matter has too. This is a fantastic book and, in my opinion, the best of the Ender Quartet.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an outstanding movie that shows the importance of fatherhood in the life of children, as well as true friendship, commitment to Christ, and the importance of such virtues as courage, integrity, honesty, and our critical need to put our trust in the Lord Jesus in all aspects of our life.  I strongly recommend that everyone over 10 years old watch this movie, and that both fathers and future fathers give heed to what is expressed as to the meaning of true fatherhood.
B000069KGM|4.0|The Chicago debut under the Chicago Transit Authority name was quite refreshing especially during the  late 1960's.  Three strong vocalists, ellaborate guitar solos, pleasing horn section and steady instrumental touches make this ear catching.<br /><br />I have little issue with the first five songs. Introduction has many different moods as the sounds vary from loud screaming guitars and gentle brass arrangements.  There are barely any wasted moments.  Does Anybody Know What Time It Is features some creative touches from Robert Lamm on keys and vocals.  The horn section is on the money again.  The trend varies to a more percussive feel on Beginnings.  Questions 67 and 68 is a pop gem with soaring Peter Ceterea vocals and great balance between athe horn section and Terry Kath's soaring guitar licks.  Listen is a cool soulful gem that features great vocals and isntrumental touches by all involved.  At a little over three minutes, the song states its purpose without overindulging.<br /><br />Tracks 6-8 have some good moments but really delve into some excessive non-melodic jamming.  The beginning of Poem 58 is fine but the solo is too long until about the four and a half minute mark Robert Lamm's vocals bring some badly needed structure.  The sound effect laden Free Form Guitar should have been cut down to a more palatable two minutes instead of nearly seven minutes.  California Purples has many creative parts but is a wee bit excessive in the jam arena.<br /><br />I'm a Man is simply stunning with Terry Kath, Robert Lamm and Peter Cetera all showcasing their vocal talents.  The extended percussion solo works greatly to my ears and Terry Kath is on top of his guitar game.  Someday is a nice piece of music although the protest part for the opening minute or so is not necessary.  Still its only a minute and it is a sign of the times so its tolerable on second thought.  Peter Cetera and Robert Lamm's vocals make this song stand out.  Liberation has a nice intro and closing with some solid guitar rhythms and a nice horn driven melody.  However the middle part is a bit excessive although at times I do like the effects between the guitar, bass and drums.  I wish the guys would have developed the opening melody for a few more minutes instead.<br /><br />Overall I like the Chicago Transit Authority Release.  Very fresh sounding and all these guys are brimming with talent.  Whereas I am keen on some of the jamming, there are a few overstated moments where the solos just do not say anything special after at a while most notably the Free Form Guitar.  Still secure this CD for your collection as the good clearly outweighs the tolerable.ms and a nice horn driven melody.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Perfect game to both challenge and relax.  Completely addictive! Almost got me in trouble on plane - I couldn't turn it off. Can't wait to try other games from this developer.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is a very fun game. Its very addicting to play. Each time you play a new it changes where the nuts are and there's always new goals to reach. Best of all its free! :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its pretty cool to me!! at first it was weird but then I read the directions and liked it pretty cool..
B006ON41FC|4.0|game wouldst got 5 stars if not for two complaints. first I would like tilt control rather than touch screen control. other thing I wish there were levels so that u weren't repeating same thing over and over again. the goals help that some. otherwise very freaking addictive game. gotta get back to it now ;) enjoy! !!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are awesome but in order to get all those games you have to earn points and get them. too much effort just to play a bunch of games!
B0063IH60K|4.0|simple instructions - one that's easy.  really clean motion and allows one to pick winning, random and replay deals. one I go to when laying down because so clear in landscape mode.
B004JY0KP8|3.0|I have been wearing this watch for several months now and find that it is a very accurate timekeeper, as expected, and it looks very nice. My only two complaints are: (1) The hour and minute hands are the same color as the face, which makes it difficult for me to read the time without \\"studying\\" the dial to find the hands, especially under dim light or when the hands are \\"lost\\" in all the dials. I would like to be able to accurately read the time with just a quick glance at the watch. (2) A lesser complaint is that the primary second hand is actually one of the small dials, rather than being the large \\"sweep\\" hand. While this problem is not as great as the issue with the minute/hour hands, it is, nevertheless, a bit of a nuisance at times. If I could have a do-over at this stage, I would choose a model with a different dial, ideally one with good contrast between (all) hands and the face, and, hopefully, with the primary second hand being the large \\"sweep\\" hand.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved it its so cool you earn the games so you never run out of games and never get boredlll
B004EPZ02A|3.0|The problem I had with this movie is the same as another reviewer. There were scenes that were shown in the trailer that were not in the movie. For instance the scene with the little girl throwing the water on some invisible being while her mother was there. The scene with a priest having his head slammed on a table by same said being.  These were two scenes that drew me to want to watch this movie. There are also other various scenes not included. This instalment didn't add up to the other two movies in my opinion. They did set up movie number four though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very very fun game. it has alot of games.in.one.. I think.that is pretty great if u.ask.me. one of the coolest mini games is where u have to bounce the soccer ball a certain amount of times to get a lot of points. this app is easy fun and interesting to get to different levels.
B006ON41FC|5.0|if you like jetpack joyride on itunes you'll like this because it just like it but a little different from jet pack joyride you fly through the sky collecting nuts avoiding trees,owls and alot more and that's why recommend this game to anybody who like jet pack joyride its the best game in the world that's why I
B0063GORYU|5.0|best spider app I've found. no issues. all others are hard to maneuver the cards, this one you can simple click or touch and drag.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|As a fan of the original \\"The Thing\\" I was looking forward to checking out this prequel. Problem was, it didn't last long in the theater. After reading several reviews, I wasn't expecting much. When the film was released on DVD, I ran by the video store to check it out. I was pleased with the film. I loved how the ending ran right into the beginning of the '82 The Thing. Plus other extras made the original even better. If your a fan of the original, it's a good addition to story.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was hooked on swype forever but it was so inaccurate.  Luckily I found SwiftKey, it is so much better than the stock keyboard and it made me forget all about swype.
0545425115|5.0|I have absolutely enjoyed this book to the fullest. Sure, it's for young adults (and I am in my 30's) but if you want to read a great page-turner, then this is the book for you. You should not go into reading this expecting to have your socks knocked off with the literary genius of the book, however if you are someone who is looking for a cool, addictive read, then the Hunger Games is just the book for you!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app! It is helping me on becoming a photographer when I grow up!  I am learing how to put photos together in good combinations that look really cool!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this seems like a good app I just got this app but so far its a good one and I enjoy biting just hope there is no problems later
B006ON41FC|5.0|this app was very fun entertaining for kids and adults. the only thing I don't like is that I wish when u buy a crash helmet u can keep _it forever don't buy the helmet
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This show is awesome! The quality of watching this show from my laptop was incredible and there were no issues with watching it!
B006ON41FC|1.0|Removed OF account as instructed on the messages or tip. Then tapped to start game. Crashed! Reopened and OF automatically loaded a new account. Did not open menu. Tapped to start. Crashed! Tried a third time. OF welcomed me back. Tapped. Crashed! Getting really tired of Devs that do not consider that a year old phone (original Droid) is not too old to make sure their apps work on it. Don't care for the control of Apple but at least the apps work.
B006ZEDZNY|5.0|Very funny.  If you are a J. Depp fan, you will love it. Funny, happy movie for the most part. Enjoy! :-)
0312611692|1.0|I find this book in a second hand book store, selling 1$ wiht other cheap porn magzines.  The author, a british \\"historian\\", clearly attempts something beyond competency of  a british historians, speculating \\" the origin of west superiority\\".  after world world two, british scholars excels and dominate in one field:  the fall and collapse of british empire, or the fall and decline of british industrial power, etc...  I open the book, find the joke the author put forward distastful, flip to the end, the author give a cliche wall street journal report on China currency and trade issue. is it all british historian can spculate? haha  at one time, the author seems intoxciated by British industrial revolution, said explicitly \\" that it is a good thing\\", it is certainly not a good thing for Africans, even the author does not count slave trade as any importance, the two world wars, the game of west brotherhood burthering each other, does not brother the author least. haha  instead, I opted my one dollar for porn magnize, the body is real, it is infiniately more valued than an piece of intellectual prostitution..
B006ON41FC|2.0|This game may very well be the greatest app ever, but I will never know. I prefer to have a choice as to who &amp; what my phone communicates with, so having an app with the audacity to create an account I don't want &amp; automatically log me on to it is unacceptable &amp; rude. Adding to that by having volume controls that are difficult to find &amp; no way to exit from within the game leads me to believe that this app needs to go back to development to be finished properly, &amp; was likely launched prematurely. For those who don't seem to care about having control over having your phone hijacked to create accounts you don't want or need, by all means play away. I, personally, will pass. Allowing an app to create accounts without the user's knowledge or permission sets a bad precident. What's next? Seriously, think about it &amp; at least make an informed decision.
B006ON41FC|3.0|i ran into a tree and used the helmet  to block it but it didnt work but other then that very fun!
0307949508|5.0|Just read The Girl Who Played With Fire and am looking forward to \\"Hornet's Nest.\\" Unlike the first installment in Larsson's trilogy, there is not a lot of direct interaction between MIkael Blomkvist and the troubled Lisbeth Salander. Cannot wait to learn how everything is drawn together. An excellent read.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I normally don't review apps, but this was impressive. Well made game, guys. Definitely keeping an eye on this developer.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Watched 3 times. Really touched my heart! Maybe it's not perfect from a commercial point of view, but it indeed touches the very depth of my heart. We have to re-think our role as a father.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Just give her the Lifetime Grammy now! Having the top selling album for this long deserves something! Would it have worked in any other decade?
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have the iPhone 4s from AT&T.  This case is perfect because it protects, looks good, fits perfectly, slides into/out-of pocket, and still takes pictures.  I have recommended this case to my coworkers who have since ordered the same case.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Beautiful and emotionally charged.  This has to be my favorite album ever.  You must take the time to sit and listen first song to the last...no shuffling here. Let it in and let it out. It makes me feel strong, sad, full of hope, small in a big world of present and past...it is an absolute perfect piece of genius and craftsmanship.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun but I hate that the app started acting up and I was forced to delete it and start ALL over again.
0307957934|4.0|I was highly entertained by Robert Harris' latest novel, The Fear Index. A quirky quant, Dr. Alex Hoffmann, has developed computer programs to create a machine that learns and produces huge returns for a hedge fund because of its ability to anticipate market movements. The power of the machine to learn has consequences for the inventor and others, and the thrilling plot kept me entertained throughout. Somewhat ripped from the financial pages about high volume nanosecond trades in and out of securities leading to market disruptions, this novel carries the power of the machine to a logical outcome. Readers who like thrillers are those most likely to enjoy this novel.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B006ON41FC|5.0|I believe it is very similiar to jetpack joyride a very well enjoyed game by many children which I love
B006ON41FC|1.0|open feint auto opt in. no way to turn off fail.  there are security and privacy issues with it.  uninstalled and concerned about what access it had
B006ON41FC|5.0|I really don't know what u guys are talking about when this game doesn't work. but it works fine in my Kindle Fire. Maybe something is wrong with your kindle fire not the game. :)
B00783NPVI|2.0|I was very disappointed with the prop flowers.  I had expected actual flowers preserved inside an acrylic block.  What I got was a cheap plastic flower that can be purchased at any Michael's Crafts sandwiched between two sheets of plastic.  It is completely tacky looking.  No wonder they don't show a picture of this; I would never have spent the extra money had I known it would be so tacky.  Way to disappoint and gouge money from the fans, Summit!
B004X80QNG|5.0|I use another program as my main calender and I really don't use the other features of this app, but I love the to do list. this app provides so many great options for managing my list and it syncs my tasks with Gmail. my other calender app also syncs with Gmail, which syncs with this, and the agenda view shows my tasks and appointments, so it makes it easy for me to estimate how much I should be able to accomplish on any given day.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|[[ASIN:B004A8ZWW4 Real Steel]] This was a great movie. Lots of action. My husband and my son loved it!!! I don't know if I'm into these types of movies, but they loved it! Thank you.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I am not a fan of the permissions and like everyone else is saying the open feint garbage. wonder how many people even use it ?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i mist love how it has many different games you could choose from. if you get bored easily this is the app for you
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is fun and amusing! Something to pass the time and keep entertained! You must fly the squirl and collect nuts without hitting trees or other objects that come at you like owls. You must also attain certain goals for status, like collecting the types of nuts and so on.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun and interesting to play and the games are really cool and i play it like twenty four seven
1416596585|5.0|In the Plex, Steven Levy's opus about \\"how Google thinks, works and shape our life\\" is the kind of book that makes you realize that you have not been at the right place in the past 10 years, and that you should have been thinking \\"BIGGER\\"!  \\"Boys be ambitious!\\" is probably something that was ingrained in the Montessori education received by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the Google founders.  The book is captivating in its description of how, within a short period of 10 years, the lives of billions of people on the planet have been changed by the Googlers' inventions.  We now \\"Google\\" a word to know what if refers to, we use GoogleMap to find our destination, we use Gmail with quasi unlimited storage space for our emails, and we use Androïd based smartphone (at least some of us do), to stay in touch.  A captivating business book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game for all ages. its both challenging and easy at the same time. I want to keep earning points just to see the games I can unlock.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|The blue-ray version is MAGNIFICENTLY restored!  Admittedly, I am a new fan of this particular version, but after watching the extras and seeing the difference, there is NO question - get the blue-ray!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Downloaded because it was free (always a plus) but found it to be fun to play when you need to kill time...cute games...works well on my kindle fire!
0393061434|4.0|As a huge fan of the Apple II and Woz I really wanted to understand how Woz and Jobs started Apple. Woz did a good job for the most part of describing it, but he left out some important things that were described in Walter Isaacson's book on Steve Jobs. Woz seems to be a genius who thinks like anl innocent teenager  It is fascinating to learn about what drove Woz and where he was strong and how Jobs pushed him. It was also interesting to see how they clashed, especially later. I felt let down that he did not cover how he got manipulated by Jobs when he created Breakout in days.  I was very disappointed that Woz did not cover the last two decade. It is like he fell off the cliff. He says he wants to constantly create new things to help society, but he did not talk about them. Very puzzling. Also, I felt you needed to be an electrical engineer or computer scientist to understand all that he was talking about. I know them, but I wonder how many people he will leave behind in his detailed technical descriptions. But, if you can get past that then you he tells a very interesting story.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think the game is easy so, you don't need to get so many app but, the game is just one app with different games in it. I think its fun because you haft to get points to unlock the game.
B003GK21U8|3.0|It was a good read but I do not think that this book will get into golden collection of literature. The problem is that I new in the middle of the book how it all ends and there was no twist really. Too simple in my opinion. Definitely not a 5 star book.
B000OHZJLY|4.0|I had some trouble sharing others' enthusiasm for \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" when it was first released in 1982. The album was, of course, in many ways a return to Costello's original starting point, after the, for me, very disappointing \\"Almost Blue\\" album. Compared to \\"Trust\\" and \\"Get Happy\\" , though,  the numbers are generally more produced, and stylistically the album spreads out over many genres.<br /><br />However my original appeal against \\"Imperial Bedroom\\" was that I thought there were only few really good tracks. Later, I have had to revise my opinion, because there are actually more great songs.<br /><br />I remember that the only tracks that really made an impression on me were \\"Shabby Doll\\" and \\"Long Honeymoon\\". I still think well of \\"Shabby Doll\\", while \\"Long Honeymoon\\" has not lasted for me. On the other hand, there are a handful among the other songs that stand out positively. \\"The Loved Ones\\" is a catchy song that well could have stemmed from Costello's perhaps best album \\"Armed Forces\\". The same description could fit \\"Little Savage\\" which probably is my favorite track on the album.<br /><br />\\"Man Out of Time\\", \\"You Little Fool\\" and the somewhat heavily-produced ballad \\"Town Cryer\\" also stand out.<br /><br />There are also a couple of real disappointments. The two Dusty Springfield pastiches \\"Almost Blue\\" and \\"Kid About it\\" can be hard to swallow.<br /><br />Conclusion: In several ways an uneven album that contains fine numbers, but which as a whole does not measure up to Costello's best. To be fair, It should be mentioned that Costello vocally is on top and he shows great versatility.
0307957934|4.0|Noted physicist, Dr. Alex Hoffman is the president of a legendary hedge fund company that has managed to create incredible wealth for its clients. His revolutionary algorithms are able to predict the financial markets before the actual trading begins.<br /><br />At the same time, Hoffman has created a wonderful life for himself. He is a multi-billionaire with a lovely, young wife who adores him, and a fantastic mansion, situated in beautiful Geneva, Switzerland. When his fortress-like property is broken into, he believes someone or something is out to destroy him. But as stranger events begin to occur, his spouse, his associates, and the police start to doubt his sanity. Even he has his suspicions.<br /><br />Eventually the reader is confronted with the question, is Dr. Hoffman actually experiencing a mental breakdown or is some he facing some strange and dangerous reality.<br /><br />For the most part, the plot is a roller coaster ride, although it did bog down for me a few times near the beginning, simply because I am not that familiar with the stock market, hedge funds, or algorithms. But I promise you, the ending will leave you breathless and maybe just a little bit frightened.

031250926X|5.0|my older son was obsessed with Brown Bear (Board Book) and literally read it until he wore it out.. I had to tape several of the board pages and the spine.  four year later we were reading it to my 2nd son.  When he started pre-school this year, I saw this version in his class and had to have it.  I LOVE that the answer window is on the same page as the question.  It makes so much more sense... Best part is that my 7 year old reads it to the 3 year old :-)
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Ive come to appreciate David Fincher immensely. He has a fantastic way of capturing a time and place and, combining it with the awesome script by Aaron Sorkin, The Social Network is easily one of my favorite movies. The collectors edition DVD includes commentary by many of the people in front and behind the scenes as well as a bunch of cool documentary's about the process of making a great film. Recomend it tremendously!

143353083X|2.0|I love the content of this bible. The notes, color maps and illustrations, and other study aids are remarkable. However, the quality control of the manufacturer is another matter altogether. I waited anxiously for this bible to arrive in the mail, only to discover upon receiving it that about a dozen pages had a 1/2\\" tear in them, and that the maps at the back were creased as well. This book has the potential to be a beautiful book, but \\"potential\\" is not acceptable. I have noticed many similar complaints in this forum. Crossway needs to do something to improve its quality control if it hopes to keep selling books!
B004PR71JC|5.0|One of the best soundtracks out there to get moving to. Some songs have a romantic side to them while others make you want to get up and samba! Great and clean music (which is hard to come these days)!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Just came back from our fellowship night where we watched this movie on Blu-ray. I don't often like Christian films because it is often weak in acting, obviously preaching rather than story telling, and bad theology that is moralistic looking within rather than to the hope that is coming from outside of us. However, this film is very well done. The story is complex, rich, and full of drama. It was still preachy at times, but the overall story telling was very well done.  I just finished watching a Movieology review of the film, and I do not often disagree with their reviews on a film. Even when I do not agree, I value their philosophical, theological and artistic insight how often found in other reviews. Movieology gives it 4 out of 5 stars. The film was created with a fraction of the price of many other nonChristian films, but it did not reduce the quality of the film.  It seams as if the film was made for a Christian audience and rightfully they are preaching to the choir. The challenge of the film was for God honoring fathers to be \\"courageous\\" in upholding their dedication for their children. It sure did that for our group tonight. I, as a father of two girls, are challenged to be even more committed to my children. It is a great message even nonChristians can appreciate.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful book. Sad, funny, uplifting. I cried lots but smiled lots as well. Would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great story that is just a little bit different.
B00000634J|5.0|I bought this for Christmas for myself as I had lost my copy from when I was 11 years old.  Amazing, and splendid.  Still as wonderful as I remember it.
0385534639|5.0|This book was without a doubt the best book I read last year. I generally read upwards of a book a week, so it had some pretty strong competition, but it was still the CLEAR winner. It was captivating. I could not put this book down and might have (did) tell (yelled at) my dad to please not bother me (get out of the room before I make you), because of my reluctance to break the magnificent illusion that Morgenstern cast.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I would have given 0 stars if I could - one of the worst films I have ever witnessed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
B004LROUNG|2.0|I've read most of Grisham's books and was sadly disappointed with this one. It starts slowly, drags in places, and just isn't up to his earlier standards. I'll be taking a break from Grisham for a while.  Sorry, John, but this book wasn't worth the price I paid.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Beuatiful, elegant, transcendent, grandiose...that is In Rainbows. This music at its finest and Radiohead again prove why they are the best band of the 21st century. This really is one for the good days :)
0061714402|3.0|Mustaine is an interesting person, at least as interesting as any drug addict turned evangelical Christian with a tendency to romanticize their life can be, and lord knows there's no shortage of those people. Other reviews have touched on the lack of insight into his creative process or anything a music fan might want to hear, though given the various states of inebriation during the creation of Megadeth's good albums, maybe it's too much to ask. The book's major problem is too much of it is turned over to the co-writer, who ruins what could be interesting insider tales with filler lines that read like a company promo piece, filled with industry language no real human being uses, such as this line about the band's '87 tour opening for Alice Coooper: \\"Alice, who had been one of the more popular rockers of the 1970s, was in the process of rebuilding his career after a handful of artistic miscalculations and personal travails. Although past his commercial peak, Alice still had a large and fervent following and a lot of respect within the industry.\\" Who says crap like that? It sounds like leftover copy from Behind the Music. The parts which do sound like Mustaine's authentic thoughts, such as his description of teenage Lars Ulrich's collection of Danish porn, clash too much with the industry nonsense the co-writer obviously added in to pad out the word count.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|This is the most thought out, step by step book as to bodyweight strength & conditioning out there! Wade starts you off easy and systematically adds exercises to put you over the top. He also gives you in-betweens to push you through when you are almost there, but not quite. In my opinion, this book is a must for any military man or independent operator that could find himself so far out in the boonies no one even knows how to spell \\"gym\\". When it comes to bodyweight strength and conditioning, this book has all the answers! Wade supplies the guideline. All you have to supply is the will, dtermination, & want-to to get it done!<br />Hawk
B0068RHSCW|1.0|Rated \\"PG-13\\" Running time: 91 mins.    Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) is looking out the window of the skyscraper office he works in. It is snowing in the city. Will just quit his job as the editor of GPH to spend more time with his family. They have just moved to a new house a train ride away.    His wife, Libby (Rachel Weisz) is excited he quit the job. The two girls will be happy to spend more time with daddy.    later that night, the youngest girl becomes scared and wants to be with her dad. Will tells her it was probably a twig from the tree. He turns off the lights and tells her it was probably her own reflection she saw.    The next day, Will goes outside to the window. He sees footprints in the snow.   Also in the cast: Jane Alexander, Taylor Geare, Claire Geare, Elias Koteas.    This movie is a perfect example of how showing too much in the movie preview trailer can spoil the surprise twist and whole story for you.    Confusing movie.   Option of language: English, Spanish, French, Descriptive Video Service.   Option of Subtitles: English, Spanish, French.   Bonus Features: Burning the House, The Dream Cast, Building the Dream House, A Look Inside.   Possibly the worst movie of 2011.   Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz are now real-life husband and wife.   It was nice to see Jane Alexander in a movie again. I haven't seen her since [[ASIN:B000CEXEWA All the President's Men (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] (1976).
0525478817|5.0|I really don't know if there are words to describe how I feel about this book.  This book...  This book...  Left me breathless.  I really had to ponder if I was reading about fictional characters or if I had really somehow ended up inside the head of a cancer infected teenage girl, in love with a cancer infected teenage boy.  I really don't know if I've ever read a book that had better \\"voice\\" to it.  It was honest, brutal, and real.  I really don't think there is any more I can say about it.  I will not be surprised if this is my favorite book of 2012, an we're only in February.  I wasn't planning on picking up this book, I'm VERY picky about what contemporary YA I read, but when I saw what good reviews it's gotten I couldn't help it.  This is one of those books that really does live up to its hype.  GO.  READ.  THIS.  BOOK.  NOW!  5 out of 5 stars!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. it is amazing. you will love it. you should get this app right now. it is the best game ever.
0765318741|4.0|It's not very often that I read a book that isn't YA.  It's even more infrequent that I read a book that wasn't written in the last 2 years.  I Am Legend was first published in 1954...  So why did I pick it up?  Well, mostly because I really liked the movie, and that's mostly because Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, if not my favorite.<br /><br />I Am Legend was certainly an interesting read.  Matheson did an amazing job of getting the reader to feel the emotions the main character is reading, loneliness, craziness, despair, determination.  The author has a fantastic understanding of basic human nature.<br /><br />I'd heard the book was quite a bit different than the movie, but I wasn't prepared for HOW different it would be!  Aside from the main character being on his own most of the time, nothing was the same.  I was really surprised when I realized the book was about vampires, not zombie like creepy creatures!  Don't even compare the two, just let them be their own separate awesome.<br /><br />For a book that is almost 60 years old, there really wasn't a whole lot that made it feel old.  Except for one word that was used... which starts with a \\"N\\" (I won't say more than that, it was offensive)... I wouldn't have guessed it was written so long ago.<br /><br />Highly recommend if you want something with a MC who isn't a teenager, but something still with paranormal elements.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars!

B0028N72A8|3.0|This was an interesting read and I learned some about Google.  However, the author often comes off like an adoring fan.  Brin and Page are generally painted as the most brilliant and good guys on the planet and perpetual underdogs.  It goes to great length to talk about what great families they came from, how smart they are, how cool they are (going to Burning Man all the time), and how dedicated to helping the user and the world.  This is generally kept at a reasonable level, but really gets crazy toward the end of the book, where they talk about Google investing to help find clean energy, map the genome, give micro-loans in India, make space travel commercially viable, and help people understand their genetic ailments.  The tendency to focus on Google's goodness tends to leave some issues unended and leaves out significant points.  For example, it talks about Click Jacking or Click Fraud and mentions that Google doesn't do as well at handling this as Yahoo did, or as it could, but then the issue just drops and they shift to something else.  They give great emphasis to Google's battles with Microsoft and paint (not completly unjustly) Microsoft as a stumbling giant, but they fail to mention the semi-parallel battles that Microsoft was fighting with Apple and others at the time.  That could have given a different view and possibly even allowed them to show similarities/differences between the battles.  Ultimately, a fairly interesting book, but the author got way \\"over the top\\" at times.
B006ON41FC|1.0|So, even after reading all of the bad reviews I decided to go ahead and download this game. I am fine with O.F. but, this game froze my KindleFIRE. So, needless to say, I uninstakked the game and it ism't a smart purchase, free or not.
B000MQ58VS|5.0|It's a great movie for all ages, that is, those who believe in fairies. I loved the melting of fantasy with reality. It was like day dreaming with visuals. Great movie!
B006ON41FC|3.0|It is o.k. but it is hard to move.<br />I give it a three star because that.<br />Skipping that it is fun.<br />I would give this free app to a 8-12 year old child.<br />If you think you would like it you are right.
0375869026|5.0|Children, teenagers, and adults will all enjoy this story. I thought I would be crying again and again throughout, but lucky for me it only happened once. This isn't a feel sorry for the underdog kind of read. It's a story that makes you realize how strong people can be. Sometimes we need some help and protection from other people, but sometimes we find that we are strong enough on our own to overcome any obstacle we put our mind to.<br /><br />Auggie isn't just an ordinary kid by any means - he's the bravest I've ever read about. I read Wonder in two sittings (it would have been one if I hadn't started it before bed) and couldn't get enough. While there are very low moments, there are highs as well - and the fact that everything that happens is totally possible, that makes it that much more touching. This is definitely a read that everyone can take something away from.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Is good and easy, I like to use during long travels and waiting time. I recommented for children my daughter love to play it useful to count and matching patterns.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|Stake Land review (DVD - no spoilers)<br /><br />The world is overrun by vampires. The government has scattered and people are now living in small towns, kept safe by checkpoints and weapons. Religion has adapted, bending to fit the vampire into its lore. Everything is about survival in some way. Martin is traveling with a man who goes by the name of mister, trying to get to a place called New Eden, not overrun by vampires. along the way he learns about how to kill them and how to outsmart them and just what makes them tick. The road is a long and strange one.<br /><br />I avoided this movie for a long time because I figured it for another of the new wave cheap flicks. I readily admit i was wrong. From the start you can see just how well the vampires fit in and just how intimidating they are from the way they sound to the way they move. Add in things like a story that grows and keeps you interested, the addition of new that pop in and out but do not feel generically added to the story, good acting, nice narration, believable fighting, and enough explanation to feel the world and the creatures in it and you have yourself something good.<br /><br />something that impressed me  about Stake Land was the fact that it added a lot of elements in the way the story developed. Sometimes you would be seeing a vampire die or watching training. Other times you might be seeing how a town works or hearing the impact on the government. Nothing too long, but enough overview to make the experience more authentic. I like that. It kept the story going forward, but diverted it just enough to make it interesting.<br /><br />I was also impressed by the acting a lot more than I would have thought. Conner Paolo I knew from the TV Show Revenge, but I never made as a good narrator or as  someone that could make killing a vampire look good. He was both. Nick Diamici offered a nice portrait of a vampire killer as well, straying from the policeman roles I normally see him play in series. Kelly McGillis and Danielle Harris added depth to their characters as well, and Micheal Cerveris make a memorable villain when he popped up.<br /><br />considering the lack of horror these days, good horror anyhow, I felt Stake Land was a treat. a well deserved 5 star watch for meto their characters as well, and Micheal Cerveris make a memorable villain when he popped up.  considering the lack of horror these days, good horror anyhow, I felt Stake Land was a treat. a well deserved 5 star watch for me
B004E2XAFW|5.0|This is one of Within Temptation's best albums yet. I was a bit worried at first that they would change their style to much, but dang, they sure did, and for the best. I can't even mention 1 bad song in this whole album.  If you are a Within Temptation fan, PLEASE be sure to get this, and if you are new to this band, you are in for quite an experience, you won't be disappointed.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Works well. It's for my son and has been worth the price. It looks nice and is functional? We got the black and it looks nice
B006YXTRHY|1.0|This was not good at all! I'm no longer interested! Vampires against wolves again are they serious?  It was a big waste of time!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous builds on the production team's previous titles, reducing the cringe inducing dialogue or videography to almost none. While the targeted audience is obviously Christian evangelicals, it effectively draws the audience into the picture producing both emotional empathy (sometimes cheesy) as well as a call to action. Definitely the best explicitly Christian film to-date, and probably the first which could start to compete with hollywood-made movies in terms of quality. I'm giving it 5-stars because I consider it best-in-class, and a significant technical improvement over films like Fireproof and Facing the Giants.
B006ON41FC|3.0|Three stars for making the game nag me to review it every couple minutes.  Otherwise the game is pretty fun.
B006ON41FC|3.0|its a fun game.....when it works. its very buggy, ive had to restart my tablet cause of it. actually oddly enough I just opened the appoint only to have it freeze and ask me to rate it

B006ON41FC|1.0|I played 2 rounds even though I did see that OpenFeint was not optional & I noticed that the controls are buggy & the graphics remind me of Nintendo's Gamecube. This is a poorly executed game & the music is irritating. The fact that you can't opt out of OpenFeint completely kills the game. Why developers feel it is an asset is a mystery to me but at least you have the option of using it or not on other games. Rubbish! UNINSTALLED!!!!!!!!!!!
B006ON41FC|2.0|locks up a lot. and controls don't. respond. well! !!  Don't. bother download int this one, it's. a waste of memory! !!!
B002VPE1XE|5.0|I had been looking for a good small case to protect my new Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX1 with the \\"pancake\\" 14-42mm zoom attached. The fit is absolutely perfect in all three dimensions. It isn't weatherproof, and the Velcro closure isn't as secure as a zipper. But for protecting the camera while it is rattling around in my briefcase every day, I couldn't have asked for a more perfect fit. Just be warned there really isn't room for anything else in the case except for spare memory cards. Things like filters, extra batteries, or extra lenses are pretty much out of the question.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are some great games, although you have to play a lot to unlock most of them it is worth it.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|The movies you know, these are the 4 Alien vs. Ripley movies.  There's 2 extra discs of goodies.  The media, Blu-ray region free.  This WHOLE SET's packaging is AWESOME.  I really wish this level of attention was give to more disc sets.  VERY NICELY DESIGNED and MADE PACKAGING!  (normally I don't get that excited about packaging...   this however is exceptionally done.)
B000092ZYX|5.0|This album honestly changed the way I listen to music.  I really don't understand why radiohead and other fans think of this as a lesser album.  If you listen to it as a whole, and not just song by song-it has really nice musical and lyrical theme.  I remember when radiohead first came out, my sister had pablo honey when I was just 7yr old.  The two songs that I remember most from when she'd put the cd on were, Creep, of course, and \\"you.\\"  Then, I remember hearing High and Dry, and Fake plastic trees a lot on the radio, then later Karma Police, then optimistic. That was when they really caught my attention. I think they really excel with their abstract electronic/rock stuff.  Cause then when Pyramid song came out I saw the video on MTV and was struck with Awe.  I still never bought an album.  Then, finally, another sister of mine got Hail to the Thief and kept playing it and raving about the interesting lyrics \\"I would eat you alive\\" and \\"walk into the jaws of hell\\"  and I gave the whole album several listens and was pulled in. This was the one that made me a fan.  I then backtracked (backdrifted) and starting buying and listening to their older stuff.  The Bends was first, it was pretty cool, then ok computer, even cooler, then, kid a; way cooler, then amnesiac, then pablo honey(eh..they had to start somewhere-blowout is  a cool song-I like the acoustic version).  To me I liked: 1.hail to the thief 2. kid a 3. amnesiac 4.ok computer 5. bends 6. pablo honey- then In Rainbows came out, and that one I would say is more approachable than any of their albums to a new listener, and it just is a cool album.  In some ways it's better than Hail to the thief and in some ways Hail to the thief still reigns by my book.  :<br />1.hail to the thief<br />2.kid a<br />3.in rainbows<br />4.amnesiac<br />5.ok computer<br />6.bends<br />7.king of limbs<br />8. pablo

B0073LWEXK|5.0|Love this style of game.  This was much more challenging than Grisly Manor which for me was great. Like that they added the hint guide in case you get stuck.  The game was easy to navigate and the graphics were good too.

081297381X|2.0|Is Nassim Taleb the smartest person on Earth?  Of course he is, just ask him.<br /><br />There's little reward for the reader who has the fortitude to get through Black Swan (B.S.).  When Taleb isn't busy reminding everyone that he used to be a trader, he's hating on Wittgenstein and other \\"alogics\\" such as Hegel and Kant, as well as the \\"middlebrows\\" who keep reading the works of such philosophers.<br /><br />Did I mention that Taleb used to be a trader?<br /><br />If you're not convinced that Taleb is the \\"polymath\\" he proclaims himself to be on the dust jacket, then you might consider reading a few pages of B.S., where you will be reminded not only that Taleb speaks many foreign languages thanks to his European education, or that he was the only person who understood the Black Monday crash of 1987, or that he used to be a trader.  Nassim Taleb also opines that he doesn't like doctors, book editors, or running to catch trains.  Given the lack of organization of his oeuvre, he should reconsider his disdain for editors.

B00333NCTM|5.0|Imagine you have an opportunity to spend a few hours with Ozzy Osbourne over dinner, drinks or whatever and you ask him to tell you his life story.  This book reads like you're sitting across from Ozzy as he tells you his life story, complete with his sense of humor and British slang.  He covers it all...his childhood, the time he spent in jail, how he met his bandmates and formed Black Sabbath, how he met Randy Rhoads and became an even bigger success as a solo artist, the tragic plane crash that took Randy's life, The Alamo, the bat, the dove, how he almost killed Sharon and why she's stuck with him all these years, how he and Sharon started Ozzfest and MTV's The Osbournes.  The main question you'll have left at the end of the book is, \\"With all the drugs and alcohol Ozzy's put in his body, how the hell is he alive?\\"  It's Rock and Roll excess at its wildest and an entertaining read.  Ozzy's story is over the top, just like you'd expect it to be.

B0062NAX1U|1.0|I was trapped into watching this movie on a VERY long overseas flight.  I thought that I was in for a cop movie based on the title, the description and the trailer.  Instead I got 2 hours of very fundamental Christian feel good and mediocre preaching.  I don't mind preaching in church.  I don't mind preaching on TV or in the movies BUT you should not pretend that this is a movie about the police or about Courage.  Do not buy this, rent it or watch it unless you want a two hour simplistic sermon.  It was so bad, and I felt so taken advantage of that I have written a complaint to the airline.  If it is religious advertising it should be advertised as such.  I would be even more offended if I were not Christian.
B006UG90RM|2.0|i wanted to like this one, but that catchy hook that makes me hit \\"replay\\" never came, and that magic sound of Eddie and Michael's background harmonies were hauntingly absent.<br /><br />i would give this 1 star, but i give it 2 stars due to their ability to play together without killing each other.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is such an awesome game. I really hate that people keep complaining about feint though! feint is not the game!
B003O86FMW|5.0|She makes you wanting more...<br /><br />Just when you think things may be settling down, there's a twist and a turn and oh my. Couldn't put this one down as well. You become more attached with Katniss, Peeta and Gale...and you just keep reading because you want to know what she might do. You get more anger and the Capitol and the gruelness which they think is so funny. This book certainly ends differently than I thought it would, but is part of the twist and turning.
0446585025|5.0|This is a funny, easy read.  Each chapter stands alone and it's written as though Ellen is doing the typical monologue she does before her show.  No crude language...just random funny topics.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to admit the concept of the book is beyond frightening...the fact that 24 kids have to fight each other to the death each year for a few people's gitty pleasure is really beyond words. But wow, Suzanne Collins pulls you in instantly. You are right there with Katniss with every move she makes - you can feel her pain, her anger, her fight...it's crazy. I'm sure one day I will pick this book up again.
B004FOA84A|5.0|My kids love this game!  Yes, it's short...but my 6-year-old and 8-year-old replay it all the time.  It is well worth a dollar!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It took awhile for this book to get going, I kind of found myself skimming some of the pages, enough to know what's going on, but to get the momentum going. Come the last few chapters I just kept thinking really, the books almost over and there is so much to uncover and find out. And of course, those are the chapters that just flew by. I have to say (without spoiling anything) that I am content with the ending. I was to the point that it didn't matter to me if she had to kill herself off to make things end or if she became the new ruler or whether she finally spilled out how she felt about Gale or realized her love has been Peeta...the ending worked for me. I can't wait for the movie to come out in March for The Hunger Games and I hope they plan on doing to complete triolgy. Definately, books I would read again.
B0039Q7QKE|4.0|The badge is a nice item for the price.  My only complaint is that from the pictures it looks like it comes mounted on a swatch of the uniform material.  It does not.  The packaging is just cheap cardboard and the color is not even close.  The badge replica itself is of good quality and a nice value.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Looks like a fun game, but auto open feint ruins it. Not installing until the devs get a clue and take it out.
B0012GVKVY|4.0|i Robot looks and sounds much better on Blu-ray than on DVD. Unfortunately, I rarely have time to watch the special features anymore, so I can't comment on that.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|Better than vinyl, and my original CD of Jethro Tull's Aqualung is now a coaster. Steve Wilson deserves a sound engineering award for this. Nice work!!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I heard one of their songs on the new AMC show Hell on Wheels. I immediately fell in love with it. I ordered the cd the same night. I love every song on the cd. They have a very unique sound that is all their own. What a great band!
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I've owned this album in numerous guises; the original Chrysalis release on vinyl, the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs' vinyl release, and the original CD release. Though I haven't listened to the whole album in years, I know it well. This CD blows the rest out of the water; the sound quality is amazing! In general terms, the clarity has been greatly improved, the soundstage is more open, and the bass...Well, it sounds like somebody turned on the subwoofer in a great sound system, and the bottom octave has been restored.  The album's songs are classic, and the bonus disc's tracks are often revelatory. If you're not familiar with the music, by all means listen to the samples to get an idea. If you love these songs as I do, but don't yet own this CD, do yourself a great favor, and buy it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun game all should get it. You can play a quick game on the go. Just get it and have fun
B006ON41FC|1.0|I wont download a game that forces open feint down my throat. I'm seriously contemplating even using games that use it even as an option. I guess its safe to assume that open feint is paying these developers to use it.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I have had this for over a yr or more, and it has been my main flash and lives in my softbox. It is amazing on a camera or off. Wish I could have more of these...  Just wish the temp over heat wasn't a big pain, even turned off
B006ON41FC|5.0|fun little game if you have a few minutes ot kill, or if you just like goofing off. hope you go nuts
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|really great app! love that I can sync it to the evernote app on my computer too! great tool for being a student and planning a wedding!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|lots of fun and keeps you on your toes. level of difficulty increases pretty evenly, can be a challenge to pick up where you left off if you haven't played for awhile and you are at a high level...all around good game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Very fun, good for passing time! I get mad because the games are somewhat difficult but still fun. My husband loves the games too, once he starts playing I cant get him to put it down, he always drains my battery.
B004WDRSO2|5.0|I remember my parents taking me to see this movie when I was a kid. I really wanted to go see it in theaters when it came back but never got the chance. I knew I had to buy it on Blu-ray and sure glad I did. Just as good as when I was a kid. Get this before it goes back in the vault!
B006ON41FC|5.0|It also has Open Feint, which is a free and fun social network. This game can improve on the graphics, but the fun, sweet, and smooth gameplay SO makes up for it!
1574216988|5.0|I am new to Zentangle.  I have Totally Tangled...and was perplexed by it, so I set it aside for a week or so while I did my own thing with Zentangle.  Then I got the book out and it all made sense.  Yoga for the Brain is even better....it is more \\"teachy,\\" in my opinion.  Explanations are better, there are exercises, it seems that from a tangle newbie's perspective, it should have been the FIRST book, and Totally Tangled should have been the sequel.  But what do I know?  Only that I really am happy that I have both books now!
B0063GORYU|5.0|the game is simple and includes basic hints its good for a free app buy it! not bad at all
B0007MWZEK|5.0|this was the original swivel sweeper. I don't need a hinge or a rubber gripper or the new color. this original sweeper works great.
B005VPRETE|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter, who is eight, and she loves it!  All the values I associate with Lego-creativity, imagination, problem-solving-are there, but in a way that appeals to girls.  It's a great way to add a different element to play-one that doesn't involve electronics.  Highly recommended.
B006ON41FC|2.0|I used Avast firewall to block this app from the internet so Open Feint couldn't connect. It really wasn't worth the trouble. It really isn't all that fun, it's not horrible, but it's not good. Not much that can be said about it really. Guess that is why most reviews just complain about the Open Feint mandatory auto connect.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I am hooked on this one. I suppose my one beef with it comes from being competitive.  it tries to guess where you mean to drop the cards. when it guesses wrong, your score is affected.  bug only by one point...
1593272200|5.0|Bought this book after skimming my friend's book.  Although Linux man pages have most of the APIs, the thoroughness of the APIs and examples are unbeatable.  It since then always accompanies me at any programming occasion on my Linux machines.<br /><br />It's ultimately the de-facto Linux handbook every Linux developer must have.  Very highly recommended to anybody who wants to have complete reference of Linux (userspace) API.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Gameplay starts off a bit laggy on the kindle fire, but it smoothes out kinda quickly.  Auto connects to open feint which I don't typically use.  Nice, easy controls to learn and gameplay isn't drawn out forever (at least for me... I may still just be bad at it)  It's worth checking out if you don't mind the automatic open feint connection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing. I love it and can't stop playing it. very addictive. not to mention mentally challenging game
B006ON41FC|5.0|You guys are whiney... Who cares about OpenFeint. Enjoy the game... The game is actually pretty awesome. But you guys have to go get upset about something stupid... figures.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I LOVE this game. so MUCH!It NEVER has any problems!totally. worth 99 cents. you could play on Cut the Rope for HOURS,no exaderation.please get this amazing game!It's SSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOO cool! You will be happy for forevermore!  Bye,friend!   from, Cut the Rope LOVER!
B006ON41FC|3.0|Game seems great but it crashes on my stock tmobo Samsung galaxy s2 after about 30 seconds.  let's me resume after reloading game but crashes again
0439023513|5.0|Before i started reading this book I thought it would be bad because it had lover ratings then the other two. To my amusement it was actually very good. Very mature and very true. The characters really felt like real people and acted like ones. I have no idea why some people didnt like it. Honestly the story was very interesting and the tension was building up just like it should have in the second one (worst in my opinion). And my god the ending... Sad but very very good. Ended just like it should have ended. Loved almost every single detail about this book. Buy. Read. ??? PROFIT
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is so cool that there are a lot of games all in one app. The games are lots of fun.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game!! Its a great time waster. Connecting to openfient has no effect whatsoever. I didn't even realize that I had connected untill reading the reviews. Honestly, if it bothers you that much, go offline.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I finally have got this to work on my Kindle Fire.  After searching and reading another Review here, I found instructions on how to Manually Install it.  After doing so It works great...  I use this on my PC and wouldn't use any other Virus software to date.  Here is the link for the Manual Install Instructions...  [...]
B002BWP49C|1.0|I own all copies of the earlier \\"Twilight saga\\", and I must say they are ALL good!  Except for this one. The wedding was way too drawn out, and boring to the point that I actually nodded-off, and fell asleep a few times. We do not need, to waste (1) hour demonstrating a wedding, to include a soft porn honey moon (sex) scene to make a point! The wedding and the pregnancy could have been gently explained in 20 minutes. Furthermore, I don't appreciate the honey moon soft porn sex scene! The pumping action in the bed was a bit much for (Parents) to view with their kids don't you think? That sex scene was kind of long and drawn out, and very unnecessary for kids to see. The producers need to realize that (Parents) are taking their kids to see this film, and I'm sure much embarrassment was caused by this sex scene. So finally after all the \\"bull\\" we finally get into the \\"meat and potatoes\\" of the script. But only the last (50) minutes of the movie was GREAT and on point! Great cinematography, great CGI, great effects and action. Great cliff-hanger! In closing, and to the producers, try to stay away from ADULT sex scenes, it does nothing for the film at all, and don't forget that young kids will be watching! Thanks
B006ON41FC|1.0|The game is okay, but it automatically connects to OpenFeint. Every other game I've played that uses OpenFeint will ask your permission to connect, which I always decline. I am upset that this developer automatically gives Openfeint access to my device without my consent. If you are concerned about the intrusiveness and security of Openfeint, and if you believe that developers should ask for your permission before connecting you to a 3rd party, do not install this app.
1451627289|5.0|I just finished reading this yesterday, and right now I'm still recovering. It's a fast paced book that is nearly impossible to put down, and is gut wrenchingly emotional. Not because of the Kennedy assassination itself, but because of the personal relationships that are developed throughout the story. The time travel aspect was of particular interest to me, and King handles it beautifully. I strongly urge you to get this book, but if you are like me and buy the Kindle version, you will find yourself reading this book at every spare moment you have (in bed, while cooking, on the subway, etc, etc).
0345529057|5.0|I wanted the first four books of the Game of Thrones series, so I bought them.  They were delivered and I'm reading them.  They were cheap and I got all of them.  Yay.  That is what I wanted.
B006ON41FC|2.0|Hi all,   Im going to make a game called &quot;force close&quot; the object is simple. First it will auto connect to openfeint upon start then, (this is where it gets tricky) it will force close!! Boots! Very addicting and hours of fun for the whole family!!! And I will only charge 1.99 for it! But not to worry because it won't take long for it to be the fairs like the rest of these useless games are! Keep an eye out, its in beta right now. I just have to delete one more  .DLL file and Villa force close for everyone!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|At the current stage of this author's fame, reviews are irrelevant, but I wanted to put in my two cents anyway. Is this a book for every taste? No. But if you are a true fan of Nicholas Sparks, you will no doubt enjoy it.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Why? Why must you make me use it? Because of that, I refuse to download this, and you get yet another 1 star review. Too bad, game looked mildly entertaining.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books and this was just as much fun as her other reads. Fun quirky heroine, romance, a bit of intrigue - what more could a girl ask for? So much fun!
B000002VSN|5.0|Whitney Houston would star in her third film \\"The Preacher's Wife\\" in 1996 and it would also contain a marvelous soundtrack. The CD would become the biggest-selling gospel album ever selling 6 million copies worldwide. Whitney herself had two huge hits from this gem, although none hit #1: \\"I Believe in You and Me\\" was a Top 5 single and \\"Step By Step\\" (written by diva Annie Lenoxx) would go to #15.<br /><br /> There are some beautiful gospel numbers here including \\"The Lord Is My Shepherd\\", \\"Joy to the World\\", and \\"I Go to the Rock\\", written by the wonderful Dottie Rambo.<br /><br /> This amazing gem of a record debut at #1 on the Gospel Album Charts and stayed there an amazing 26 weeks in a row.
B0006N2EZ0|3.0|On March 30, 1981, just 69 days into the presidency of Ronald Reagan, deranged Texas native John Hinkley Jr. attempted to assassinate the President over some bizarre obsession with Jodi Foster. Written in the 1970s originally intended for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross, the 90s 'The Bodyguard' uses this real-life incident as a plot-angle in this romantic suspense thriller that has an absolutely superb concept, yet comes short on total execution. The beautiful and tragic Whitney Houston plays herself basically here as music superstar Rachel Marron with the misfortune a perverted and quite ruthless stalker who seems hell-bent on killing her. Enter Frank Farmer (Costner), a former U.S. Secret Service agent, also considered 'the best', in Hollywood's classic cliche, is talked into being her protector. You see, Farmer was Reagan's bodyguard in 81', yet the one day he's not on duty is when the assassination attempt takes place. This haunts him to this very day. Rachel's clearly attracted to him the moment she lays eyes on him, and shows it by being a b!ch (don't worry gals, we get it) about his expertise in the art of protection interfering in her lifestyle. Heavy romance develops between the two, then there's some twists and turns in the plot and sh! hits the fan.<br /><br />The one thing I do admire most about this film is the interracial love story is told without any reason to rationalize it for stupid reasons. Ethnicity isn't brought up, just two adults falling for eachother under the circumstances. And I also think that adds to the romantic tension between the two in a pleasant way. This is quite rare in Hollywood. Unfortunately though, the movie starts to gradually collapse about 2/3's of the way through. It gets insubstantial and even too slow at some points. The ending is semi-cool, yet, again, predictable - can pretty much be seen a mile away. But don't forget to look out for Robert Wuhl playing himself in a hilarious cameo.<br /><br />Overall 3/5.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|\\"One Wish\\" is Whitney Houston's only Christmas album. Released in 2003 it didn't sell well, no doubt due to the public's interest in Whitney's personal life at the time so, unfortunately, this little gem got lost in all that confucsion. Still, \\"One Wish\\", is simply one of the best Christmas albums ever with Whitney's voice in full force as she takes commands of various Holiday songs.<br /><br /> Highlights here include \\"The Christmas Song\\", \\"The First Noel\\", \\"Deck the Halls/\\"Silent Night\\" and \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" that features Whitney's then 10 year old daughter Bobbi.<br /><br /> Two tracks here are also songs brought from \\"The Preacher's Wife\\" soundtrack: \\"Who Would Image a King?\\" and \\"Joy to the World\\".<br /><br /> The CD has so far only sold a little over 400,000 copies, 100,000 short of going Gold.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Not even going to bother to download. Game looks fun but no one gets to dictate my inclusion in the use of third  party software when I have a choice. No thanks.
B00000DFRS|5.0|\\"My Love Is Your Love\\" became Whitney Houston's first studio album since her 1990's \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\". Although it only went as high as #13 on the Billboard Pop Album Charts it still managed to produce 3 hits for Whitney: \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", \\"When You Believe\\" (a duet with Mariah Carey) and \\"It's Not Right but It's Okay\\", all Top 5 songs. The title song became one of Whitney's biggest songs globally selling over 3 million copies. In the U.S. the record has gone 4X Platinum. Whitney would also win another Grammy for Best R&B Vocal Performance for \\"It's Not Right but It's Okay\\".<br /><br /> There was also a CD release of various songs from this album that were dance mix versions that became extremely popular in dance clubs around the world. The remix version of \\"It's Not Right but It's Okay\\" went to #1 on the Dance Charts.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|This is the second major Lego set I've done having finished and loved The Pirates of the Caribbean's Black Pearl. One thing I liked about The Black Pearl was the way the Lego's were nicely separated into numbered bags corresponding to the order in which the pieces are assembled. I assumed the Camper Van would be divided similarly particularly since the set contains over 1300 pieces. This is not the case. Not only are the bags not ordered but the pieces seem almost randomly separated. The exact same pieces are in multiple bags and early on I had no choice but to open every single bag to get the pieces required by the instructions. The difficulty of the build was mostly due to the challenge of finding pieces. Eventually I had to get a bunch of containers and carefully separate the pieces into groupings. I don't mind a difficult build but if the difficulty is due to playing `Where's Waldo' with the pieces it seems gratuitous.<br /><br />Once completed the camper van is absolutely fantastic looking. This one looks wonderful sitting on my dresser. The biggest complaint I heard concerning this build was in assembling the front roof. One reviewer even resorted to gluing it and although I can see their point I didn't have nearly that level of difficulty. I would also say that with the density of this model and the number of small pieces it is much easier to do with modest or small sized hands. It's also probably a lot harder if you don't have fingernails to pull pieces back apart. This one will probably take three or four hours and if I were to do it all over again I would have done a lot more prep work in organizing the pieces before jumping into it.<br /><br />Between The Black Pearl and The Camper Van I enjoyed building the Black Pearl more if for nothing else than the separation of the pieces. Again, I love a challenge and the Camper Van was a total blast to build but I felt that much of the challenge was unnecessary. There is a ton of detail like gas and break pedals that move up and down and a movable stick shift. One chair can be folded down to form a bed although the idea of it is somewhat cooler than the actual execution. I'll also say that the drapes look better in pictures and videos than in reality and they were one of the tougher parts to put on which was certainly unexpected. Like many of the other major sets this one is not to scale with the minifigs and does not come with any minifigs. You couldn't, for instance, have it going down the street of your modulars without looking absurdly oversized.<br /><br />In the end I very much enjoyed assembling the VW Camper Van and would have no shame putting it out for display as it's just that cool looking. I wouldn't doubt if years from now this becomes a sought after set although you'd have to refrain from assembling it to really keep the value and what fun is that. It's a hefty price but this is a high quality premium set so you're paying extra to get more. I wouldn't recommend this set for younger kids or for playing with. The wheels are not steerable so it's limited to forward and back and like I said it's not scalable with other sets. This really is a set built for display. Hopefully LEGO will come out with similar sets in the upcoming years.hat move up and down and a movable stick shift.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|I bought the DVD/Blue ray set and enjoyed rewatching it.  This is a handsome version with crisp sound and picture.  This is a must for those who value a solid storyline, great animation and believable multi-dimensional characters.  The charcaters are the film.  The catchy classic score is another reason for the success of this film.
