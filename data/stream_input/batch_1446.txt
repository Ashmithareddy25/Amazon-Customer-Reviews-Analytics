B007SYWFRM|5.0|if you take the time to explore the game instead of jumping to the conclusion you have to shut down yeah right. go to the options and the bottom bar will pop up ha it is not a game trap. people sure are idioticly dumb these days haha
B005JABSB6|5.0|I purchased two of these 3D glasses and they are great.<br />They feel better than the orginal glasses that came with my Sharp 3D TV.<br />They are easy to recharge and no need to buy batteries.<br />The best part was Amazon.com sales them for less $50.00.<br />Now how great is that.
B004SYP5WC|3.0|This bill reminder does, pretty much, what is necessary for me. My bills aren't complicated except for one and it took me a while to figure out how to input it. I have a large amt for ttl due, but smaller monthly payments. Since I don't have a lot of bills, it doesn't matter if it shows up twice. I just disregard the larger $ one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love all the little background noises.  Very sweet mellow little game.  Its a nice respite when I need a break from the nastyness of the real world.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Thank you for a very good mahjong game. Great graphics, great sounds, very soft and relaxing. Love the splashing.  I do like how it works the brain.
B004LWZW88|2.0|This movie looks like it's going to be a very funny story about a cat who happens to be so full of himself, well, it is not that good. The only funny parts are in the trailer. You have been warned.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|While this book is not intellectually stimulating, I couldn't put it down.  The girls in my book club and I all bought it and we finished the entire series within a matter of days.<br />It's enticing and it will give you a chance to escape reality, and isn't that what books are about? At least from an entertainment standpoint, these books are wonderful.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game, very additing!! i love waking up and collecting all my coins and seeing how much money k hot and how many animals i have compaired to others. my daughter even loves to play it!! i just wish there were more mini games on it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I REALLY want to read this too but not for $30.00.  Amazon is totally taking advantage of people with this download.  I won't buy it until it comes down in price.
B003VIWZNS|3.0|A story is of the inherited, perhaps, from a colonial Mother-country's legislation allowing throwing a family out of a property owned by a single member in response to this person's deeds whether bail-related (as in this movie) or simply demented actions used expertly by the age care strangers-involved not in Australia, probably, only.<br /><br />A middle-U.S.A. short-of-usual-sports-cars-and-boyfrends seventeen year old girl growing up siblings and looking after a mentally charged mother searches for and finds an evidence of father's passing away to secure a family home targeted by the State as a bail refund for dad's not appearing at the hearing.<br /><br />It is a very educative story of a British system reality well survived two centuries of the U.S. independence.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Interesting premise, and worthy of the attention of the group (younger folks) I believe it was written for....not that older generation don't need to be reminded of the possibilities.....<br />Alot of twists and turns in the plot, surprises so we never get too settled in....<br />For an avid and sdult reader, it is a blow thru, easy to read and absorb set of books.<br />Reading her Underland series now....another quick read, and perhaps a little harder to swallow, but still a fun read.
0345803507|5.0|It's been a long time since I've been so captivated by a series that I couldn't stop reading until it was over.  I almost stopped about half way through the last book so it wouldn't be over but I couldn't help myself.  Thank you EL James for these amazing books!  I loved Christian and watching his view of the world change as he fell in love.  Not so crazy about Ana as she seemed a little like a spoiled child that just couldn't quite get over herself sometimes, but she grew as well.  This book really tied the story line together and it felt so good to see Christian learn to live life instead of living in a glass bubble.  Can't wait to see what comes next - could there possibly be a sequel somewhere down the road???
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really disappointed with the characters. They were not developed - there was no depth; book did not involve the reader.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some fun games<br />way to pass the time without actually using my brain...<br />great for lines or the DMV...  lol
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am so happy that Amazon stopped torturing us and gave us what we wanted. Now all we need is Temple Run and I will be happy :)
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|loved the game for the time it worked....I had it for 3 days and now it won't let me open it. really wish I could play it still :(
B007TNS6JI|3.0|great graphics but boring game each level is the same objective the enemies just look different.  if they use the same game engine but give it some creativeness so we can go places.  its more like an arena
B0061S073A|5.0|My 9 year old got a kindle for his birthday.  Next question was,  how do I know he is reading and not playing angry birds.  I use the app during the week and before homework is done.  then I can quickly exit with the password and we have a happy family.  Super easy to change the apps you allow.  took me a little while to figure out how to open a book.  you have to add the kindle and launcher.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|first ebook i put on my kindle fire.....fast and easy from amazon....easy to download and start reading right away.  20 words?  once upon a midnight dreary
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Dying to be Me is a moving story that is very well written. I couldn't put it down and read it cover to cover twice.<br /><br />It is broken into three parts: 1. Her life leading up to and through the time of her illness; 2. Her Near Death Experience; 3. Her reflections of her experiences after her NDE.<br /><br />For many years I have been interested in life beyond the physical time and space that we experience on this plane. Anita Moorjani does a wonderful job of describing this in her book. I have always felt that it's impossible to describe anything that is beyond our knowledge and words. She uses metaphors to put it into some perspective rather than trying to exactly express that which is beyond our limited frame of reference.<br /><br />This book is valuable for many reasons. It is well written and easy to read. It addresses many aspects of her story with well documented facts. And I found it to be very encouraging for anyone who wants to live a full life. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone.
B006Z9SP3E|1.0|Having read the first part, I was expecting the 2nd part to be as good, if not better. Not so, unfortunately it is more like a 3rd grade soap opera, unrealistic, predictable and with an open ending - leaving us to believe there will be a sequel. If so, it won't be on my shopping list.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it it is a very fun game .  ale like to play in our free time on the kindle and on our phone
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|i just happen to try it i love it keeps busy its great for its great for your memory to try to repete the same thing to get all the stars.
0545265355|5.0|I saw the movie and just had to order the books.  My wife read all three in one week. I am still working on book two.  They are hard to put down.  You will be short changing yourself if you do not order all three.
B000A2IPPK|1.0|I bought a \\"new\\" dvd from someone through Amazon for my grandsons 7th birthday. It was very expensive because I needed a full screen version of E.T.! I got back in touch with Amazon who got in touch with the seller. I was told NOT to worry about returning the video if it didn't work...BUT I would also be reimbursed my money. IT NEVER HAPPENED TO THIS DAY!!!!! Be very careful who you deal with on Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Wow!  When this book was selected for book club, we had no idea what we were getting into.  The book is well written and a quick read.  Once you get into the story, it is hard to put down.  The tales told are unimaginable in an American life, but true for Shin, a real man.  I encourage people to read this book. For many it will be unlike what you usually read (it was for those in my book club), but well worth the time.  This is one of the most engaging books I have read in a while. I hope to see Shin speak someday.
0393338827|5.0|A very entertaining book about the mortgage lending to lower middle class people and the subsequent crash. I have read some of the one star reviews of the book and I agree with some of what they are saying. However, one needs to think about the book as a historical novel. It is not actually a novel, but it is novel-like. So the main characters are portrayed a good and very smart. Of course, in reality, they are that smart, but that is besides the point. The author gives a portrait of Wall Street that feels very true - he captures the Zeitgeist. When he describes the ignorance of some of the banks, he is describing reality even though some details might not be correct. So if you are an outsider to Wall Street, you get an understanding of the kind of characters involved in the industry.<br /><br />This is a very easy to read book, so do not expect to come away with a deep understanding of what happened. The author is not an expert on the industry. You get the micro-level perspective, which has to be complemented with more macro-level explanations. Read the book as entertainment and as a bonus you get a description of some of the kind of people you find on Wall Street.<br /><br />Before I buy a non-fiction book, I always find it useful to check youtube to understand whether the author is smart enough for me to warrant spending time reading his book. With that purpose I encourage you to check \\"Author Michael Lewis discusses The Big Short and the future of finance\\" before buying.<br /><br />A solid five star book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is lots of fun to play.  There are always new challenges to meet and plenty of opportunities to earn coins and acorns.

B007VDPMYI|2.0|Clocking in at a smidge over 30 minutes, this compilation would be a poor value if all of the songs were great. Several are. Several others induce pain including Mama You've Been on My Mind and Woman Don't You Cry for Me, two attempts at mimicking his friend Bob Dylan with whom he collaborated while recording some of these songs. The former does demonstrate why guitarists admire Harrison, but the latter and the closing track, The Light that has Lighted the World, make it clear why Harrison famously asked Dylan how he came up with all those great words.<br /><br />Harrison styled himself as a spiritual man and should be given credit for leading millions to consider God and religion seriously. But in the version of Awaiting on You All on this compilation (unlike in the version on All Things Must Pass) his lyrics are discernible, and he undermines his image as a man of peace when he disses the Pope because the Catholic Church had invested in the stock exchange. Not Catholic myself, I nevertheless find Harrison's contempt unwarranted not to mention ironic given Harrison's massive wealth at the time.<br /><br />Like Harrison, I take God seriously, but I take Harrison's moral musings a lot less so especially since it was revealed recently that he carried on an affair with his friend Ringo Starr's wife. He announced his ongoing infidelity in 1973 at a dinner party in Starr's home with Starr present, [...]. This skimpy compilation treats Harrison's fans a bit similarly.
0307352145|4.0|Susan Cain's book, \\"Quiet,\\" is one of the first widely-accessible studies of what introverts are like, what they endure, how they are valuable to a society that seems dominated by extroverts, and what can be done to help ourselves or our introverted children to enjoy a more fulfilling life. It is a worthwhile book but it only opens the gate to vast new areas of psychological, medical, sociological and even political exploration.<br /><br />I live in a community that is not merely extroverted but militantly so.  People will openly say, \\"If you like it here, fit in. If you don't, leave.\\"  Fitting in means being an extrovert, being politically conservative, spending your time making money or engaging in social pasttimes with superficial acquaintances, attending the local football games with team emblems fluttering from your car, and above all, being physically active. It's just fine to be loud, overbearing and expect everyone else to go along. But under no circumstances be caught reading a book, reflecting, engaging in introspection, enjoying classical music or jazz, dining alone (especially while reading), or thinking differently from others.<br /><br />If you are out in public, assume everyone wants to hear your cell phone ring and listen to you yelling into it.  If you are on a date or with your spouse or child, why bother talking to them?  You can be together as you check your respective messages!  It's almost as intimate as watching TV together.  Assume the whole world cares about your personal life.  Assume that everyone is palpitating to hear you brag about your recent trip to Tuscany (or wherever) and about how you got great deals there - and yet absolutely nothing of the area's values, language, or culture made any impression on you. You are still the same superior and smug jerk you were when you left.<br /><br />When you drive, be sure you can get ahead of someone else and cut them off, so you can prove you are ahead of them and can get somewhere else first.Also, check your messages and yack into your cell phone while driving.  You are the most important person on the road and everyone should get out of your way as your huge gas-hog SUV careers like a bully, speeding and weaving through traffic.  You are never wrong.  Everyone else should do or want the same things you do.  If anyone objects, then sneer, threaten, bully or crush him or her.  (No wonder bullying is a national epidemic.  Many kids are merely emulating their parents.)  And by all means, argue that being bullied makes people stronger, like being tortured.  You can only be right.  You are the ultimate, the most important person.<br /><br />This mentality, if such a word applies, is like the mentality of Rush Limbaugh and innumerable other right-wing bloviators.  It is what is wrong with this country.  It fails to recognize the legitimacy of others - one's own countrymen and women.  It means you cannot compromise: you must get your way at all costs.<br /><br />Susan Cain may not have felt she had a political message, and doubtless she did not intend to convey one.  But there is no point in beating around the bush.  She has put her finger on one of the most important and serious problems with America today: no one wants to learn, reflect, consider, weigh alternatives and arrive at a candid decision about what's best for the nation as a whole.  Those traits get in the way of what is all-important - action for its own sake.  Therefore rush outdoors, run, bike, jog, hit the line hard, shove others out of the way, get, grab, take, and never look back.  And be sure our nation is too busy being distracted to notice that we are no longer Number 1 in the world in anything, except arms and arrogance - and the number of our people who are in prison.<br /><br />A fascinating book this is, but it is only the beginning.  We need to see what can be done not only to advance the introverts among us, but to reclaim balance in our personal and national lives.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|(Revised review 2/4/13) I loved this app when I first installed it. It was so easy to use and offers several different versions of the Bible. But a recent update rendered it impossible to use on either of my Android phones. It keeps giving me a notice that I have to download the offline versions. I downloaded them on one Android, but it still doesn't work. Tried to download to the second Android, but it never completed the process.<br /><br />It does still work on the Kindle Fire, thankfully. But I had to choose a different Bible app for my Androids.

B0079R8IYW|3.0|This is an average cover for the Kindle Fire.  There is nothing special except the four credit card holders inside the front flap.  It has a nice feel and magnetic corners but the main problem with this cover is the way it stands the Kindle Fire.  It uses a back flap that needs to be pulled out before the cover can slide into it.  This makes for an awkward stand and poor Kindle positioning.  I can only moderately recommend this as there are much better covers out on the market today.
0545265355|4.0|Firstly, The Hunger Games is not a story based on an original concept.  If you've ever read The Lottery short story by Shirley Jackson, you'll see the theme that was the basis of this story explored in a shorter form. This is not a criticism, it's just perspective because Ms. Jackson's story has it's roots in myth and culture and, as has been noted, \\"there is nothing new under the sun.\\"<br /><br />The issue is not where the idea for the story originated, the issue is with how competently it is executed and in this case, Ms. Collins did an outstanding job.<br /><br />I had avoided The Hunger Games for over a year while friends raved about it.  These same friends read the Twilight series and watched the movies and I'd rather drive nails in my skull than be subjected to that story.<br /><br />But after I saw a preview of the movie early in 2012 and was able to read the first book for free as part of my Amazon Prime membership, I bought the trilogy and read it, enjoyed it, saw the movie, and just finished re-reading the books again.<br /><br />It's not perfect.  There are holes scientifically and culturally, but it is enjoyable and even though the main character is a young woman, I would not class it as young adult fiction since, even though there is no sex mentioned or described, it deals with some rather adult themes and it does it not horribly.<br /><br />The characters have depth and breadth, even the ones we see briefly and though we are treated to some cookie cutter characters in the ancillary, we deal with the same thing in everyday life where we pigeon hole people who brush against our day and never grow out of the roles to which we've assigned them.<br /><br />I won't say the author planned her treatment of these characters in this manner but it did not grate on me while I read the books and, really, that's about the best you can do considering the absolute hatred I have felt for various writing styles that barely define two dimensions for main characters.<br /><br />So, I found the story enjoyable, I found the writing style accessible, and I found the conclusion believable within the context of the world created.<br /><br />But, most of all, when the story ended, I found myself wishing there was more.  I did not wish there was more because I felt I had burning unanswered questions or unresolved plot points, rather, I just wanted to see what the future held for the world Ms. Collins had created.<br /><br />That's a win in my estimation.<br /><br />So, why only 4 stars?  It's a good, solid series that holds up to multiple readings, but it's not a game changer like Mockingbird, Lord of the Rings, The Three Musketeers, and other books and series that either defined of refined a genre.><br />So, I found the story enjoyable, I found the writing style accessible, and I found the conclusion believable within the context of the world created.<br /><br />But, most of all, when the story ended, I found myself wishing there was more.

It's King at his descriptive best with every paragraph full of information and leading you into the next and the next.  I was a kid during the Kennedy years so it was fascinating for me to read about life back then.  Brought back lots of great memories.  The ending was a satisfying resolution of events as well.  I'd highly recommend this one to history buffs as well as supernatural and thriller fans.  It's right up there with The Stand, may even better.

B003PGNBO8|4.0|When I started watching the DVD I was pretty sure that I would give a one-star<br />rating - Simply because the show was not finished....<br />In the end I give 4-stars because it really was a pretty good show. Amazing concept, good actors,<br />It could have been one of the best shows ever made on TV!<br /><br />The real downside comes from the stupid network-writing for the \\"simple-minded\\".<br />I imagine the creators fighting with the ABC guys who demanded \\"dumbing-down\\" with the usual<br />storylines (\\"We need a mole, We need a double agent, We need more love-life issues......\\")<br /><br />Of course the show was not really finished, but the \\"End\\" is not so bad..... Actually it would have been a great<br />ending had they really focused on ONE SEASON and focused 100 % on finishing their plot.<br /><br />Still worth a buy!<br />And my advice to the creators! Next time go for cable..... networks are not suited anymore<br />for a show like this - they always ruin it!

0062082353|4.0|This is the best SEAL book I've read in awhile, and I've read quite a few.  It will especially appeal to those with an interest in special operations and snipers.  In the book, former SEAL Chris Kyle writes of his experiences as a SEAL sniper in Iraq, eventually becoming the most lethal sniper in US military history.  The story is told well, in a way that you'd expect a SEAL would tell of his background and experiences.  It also has a fair amount of attitude and opinion--which I liked--but some may not.  Basically, when you've been there and done what the author has done, attitude comes with the territory.  In the end, the book is not all about the author, but also pays tribute to his teammates, some of whom were killed or wounded in action.  This is an outstanding book for many reasons--one bonus is the story of how the author knocked out \\"Scruff Face,\\" aka Jesse Ventura--who absolutely deserved what he got.

B007CKNX28|5.0|I've always admired Jack White's band work in small doses, so I was curious how his solo project would differ. Wow, color me impressed. All of these songs are thoroughly engaging, thanks not only to solid songwriting and passionate performances, but also spectacular arrangements. I love the variety of instrumentation here -- it's a wonderful rootsy blend of rock, blues, country, bluegrass, honky tonk, folk and old time music hall. What's really outstanding is the piano playing, and I'm not sure who is responsible since the videos I've seen show at least three different players, including Jack. I haven't heard dynamic rock piano like this since Rick Wakeman played on David Bowie's Hunky Dory or Mike Garson played on Bowie's Aladdin Sane. Really spectacular, and none of the reviews I've read in the press seem to notice it. Astonishing. Anyway, I understand Jack has more tunes half finished from this session, and I hope he doesn't wait long to finish them.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have been a 21 year old virgin who has never even touched herself and very uninformed about erotic sex or any other sex. The sample gives the impression that this may have a Cinderella type plot. Maybe it does, but I will never know because I was not interested in reading farther than the day after the first sex. Now don't get me wrong, I now think sex is the greatest part of life, but I guarantee that the day after I had sex for the first time, I had the problem my mother told me about \\"so sore you couldn't touch it with a powder puff\\" - how real does it seem that she would be that interested that soon - come on. I don't enjoy this type of read, but apparently as observed about movies, TV shows,Internet - everything is acceptable. I wish I could get my money back.
0807014273|4.0|A Man's Search for Meaning is definitely worth reading. The first half of the book is an easy 5 stars but the second half not so much. The entire book is good and I would suggest it to anyone. I would especially recommend it to anyone interested in psychology.
B007Q2N0HA|3.0|I will spare you the synopsis as it is clearly stated above. I will warn you if a spoiler is mentioned, but will try not to ruin it for you!<br />Bared to you is a book about how two emotionally damaged individuals find their safe place in each other. Both characters are damaged but drawn to each other and the reader gets to see that struggle for balance. Before reading this book, I noticed the reviews compared it closely to 50 Shades of Grey. Many have even said it is a copy or mock up of the book but I couldn't disagree more. As someone who has read 50 shades of Grey, I will say that there are some minor aspects of Bared to you that are similar but not in any way the same. It is impossible for an author to write a book that one cannot in some distant way connect with another book because fiction doesn't have a start and end point. So with that said, Bared to You and 50 Shades of Grey function as two different fiction novels. Like I said, there are minor aspects that connect distantly in 50 Shades of Grey, but is not in any way plagiarized or copied as others say. 50 Shades of Grey had a little too much BDSM for me to feel comfortable with so I feel that is important that I say Bared to You is nothing like that.<br />**small spoiler** There are small mentions of \\"Dominants\\" and \\"Submissives\\" but only in one scene really when the characters are talking. But it does not involved bondage or any real BDSM practices in the book. There is an abundance of sex scenes but no tying up or flogging at all.<br /><br />In sum, I liked this book. There were some parts in the book I was unsure about, but I enjoyed it none the less. I would read the sequel but I am not crazy over it. But in the same respect I felt I needed to clear the air about Bared to You vs. 50 Shades of Grey.<br /><br />Katerina Crider
0345803485|3.0|As I began reading this novel, I was anticipating some steamy romance from what all I had first heard. After seeing this book featured and talked about on news networks, I figured there must be a valid reason to venture out and buy it. To my surprise this book was far from captivating- after reading the first hundred or so pages, the book became very monotonous and utterly predictable. The main character, Anastasia is rather one dimensional and she starts to become annoying because she constantly says \\"damn this\\" and \\"damn that\\" and overused the word 'crap'. I did not get caught up too much on the fact that the protagonist in the novel was a 21 year old virgin. I didn't find that to be too much of an anomaly because in find it hard to believe that every young girl these days is putting out!  On another note, I find James' vocabulary to be very limited as the diction in the book is simple and repetitive. As far as the sex scenes, they are very predictable because every 15 pages or so there is a sex scene-I don't think the sex scenes are vanilla, per se, however I do find that every sex scene seems to become the same as prior ones. I find the main character, Anastasia, to be very passive and I first thought that this novel could be a commentary on the gender roles in today's world but the more I read it, the more I realize it is a rag! If I get really wrapped up in a book I can usually find ways to empathize with the characters and analyze them, but I did not get that feeling from reading this novel. Reading S&M sex scenes in this novel becomes very monotonous and tedious. The only reason I rated this book as 3 stars is on account of the fact that it is a quick read and definitely \\"mommy porn\\"-not exactly my cup of tea but if that is what floats your boat then you just might find this book enjoyable.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I purchased this game for my son and grandkids. They love it! The animation is funny. The game has a simple task,but you become determined to keep going. I brought it to my son's karate class  to keep the kids busy and the adults ended up playing. GREAT!

B0073XORCY|3.0|Being a long time fan of Jethro Tull (1974) I have had my ups and downs with the band's music throughout their very long career. While I will admit that nothing they have turned out since 1979 has ever struck quite as close to the glory decade of the 70's, I still buy each and every \\"album\\" (sorry, please excuse my age-defining terminology) with ever dwindling hopes that I will find that spark that infused Ian's writing in that truly inspired decade. A few close calls (Broadsword, Crest) but so many more misses. So, with the impending release of a follow up to the epic brilliance of \\"Thick as a Brick\\" I was very excited. Could this finally be the CD to recapture that previous glory? The answer, sadly, is \\"No.\\" Not by a long shot.<br /><br />I have now listened to the CD several times and I will admit that it does get better with subsequent listenings. But it still falls far short of what it could be. To compare I also listened to the original and after hearing it again it only drove home the shortfalls of the new endeavor. For one, Ian's voice is just about gone. It is so stark of a contrast to the original that it doesn't even sound like the same person. But this is old news to all fans of Jethro Tull, we've known the shortcomings of his voice for many years now and I know this is no fault of Ian's and on some occasions it can even pass for melodious. But not so much here. In fact, Ian has taken to simply speaking parts of the album. He clearly knows his limitations but the spoken passages take the listener out of the experience of the music. Speaking of music, it is very important to know up front that this is an Ian Anderson SOLO album not a Tull album. It is the usual gathering of experienced and competent musicians that Ian surrounds himself with. But I wonder if this isn't part of the problem. This SHOULD be a Tull album. Ian needs those fellow Tull members to fill in the gaps and to bring about a more cohesive sound. The original was one long piece of music even given its frequent changes in tempo and melody but it FELT like it all went together. The new Brick just feels like a normal album made up of a bunch of unrelated songs. Not what I would expect.<br /><br />Had this been by anyone else I would have graded it at two stars but Ian gets a pass simply due to the fact that it has some mildly good bits in it and, like I said, I have been a fan for many, many years. I do appreciate the effort which I know goes against every bone in Ian's nostalgia-hating body. He gave it a go, it just didn't work. And while I seem to be, for the most part, negative about this thing, I should also point out that it has simply the worst cover of any Tull or Ian solo album ever. Yikes! And what's with \\"Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson\\" plastered on the front? Is there a question about which band an Ian Anderson performing a sequel to Jethro Tull's \\"Thick as a Brick\\" might be from? Just one more clue that this SHOULD have been a Jethro Tull album. So to that ideal I finish with this quote from the original\\"<br /><br />\\"So!  Where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?<br />And where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you though?\\"<br />They all got sacked in 1980!

B007IE4DSG|5.0|George Harrison became quite prolific towards the end of The Beatles. George had stockpiled songs finally finding his groove as a songwriter. \\"Early Takes Volume 1\\" is being released in conjunction with [[ASIN:B007JWKLP6 George Harrison: Living In The Material World [Blu-ray]]](it's also available on DVD)a documentary by Martin Scorsese about George, his beliefs and his music. The album focuses on giving us a glimpse behind-the-curtain as George presented his demos to co-producer Phil Spector or worked on early takes of the material. I prefer many of these unadnored versions to the originals.<br /><br />The bulk of the songs are drawn from \\"All Things Must Pass\\" era. Two songs are drawn from 1976's \\"33 1/3\\"(\\"Let It Be Me,\\" \\"Woman Don't You Cry for Me\\")and one is drawn from the \\"Living in the Material World\\" sessions (\\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\"). We get a really good cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Mama You've Been on My Mind\\" as well.<br /><br />The music is terrific although as others have noted this is a pretty short CD clocking in at just over 30 minutes  while there is considerably more material out there that is good enough to be released. Hopefully the Volume 1 subtitle can be taken literally and we'll see the the best of the rest of the outtakes and demos officially released.<br /><br />I would have liked to have a booklet with notes on the recording sessions but that's a minor quibble.<br /><br />The mastering by Steve Rooke (who worked on The Beatles, John Lennon, Badfinger, Paul McCartney, \\"All Things Must Pass\\" vinyl remaster and the Apple reissues)is exceptionally good and Giles Martin (son of George Martin) did nice work at finding and compiling some unusual and strong performances.<br /><br />Hopefully we'll also see the songs that George recorded for \\"Somewhere in England\\" that were later dropped at the insistence of the record label at the time (they did show up in George's limited edition book)as well as demos for other songs from throughout his solo career.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Beatles and George Harrison fans.olo career.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Beatles and George Harrison fans.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|When I first read this trilogy, a year ago, I liked the first two books and did not like the third book.<br />Now, after watching the movie, I must admit that this is one of the worst stories I have ever come across.<br />I am ashamed of the number of people I have recommended these books to.<br /><br />The story is utterly depressing.  I can't fathom why I liked it a year ago, but if someone had told me the way<br />the story ends, I wouldn't have read the hunger games trilogy..<br /><br />The first book is set up similar to Roman Colosseum killings, more or less, very brutal and...<br />The second book introduces you to past tributes that you can't help liking and..<br />The third book kills off a lot of characters, and I found myself asking, what's the point of all this?<br /><br />You want tragedy? turn on the news.

Overall, it wasn't boring, predictable or poorly written.

Now I feel like I've hit the gold mine with this book.  One thing in particular that I like is that alternative colorways are shown, so whereas you might skip over a project because you don't like the colors, now you can pause and see it in a new way.  Great job, Sabine!

I can't really say too much about the movie but it involves a group of people that go out to sea in a yacht and then capsize.  They are stranded and end up being saved by a mysterious deserted liner.  Once on board things start to take a turn for the worse and well I can't really say much more.  Have a cuppa, sit back and enjoy this movie.

B006ZZANG0|5.0|It's funny, I've heard of Rufus Wainwright before, but never considered myself a fan in any sense. Not a single track, much less CD; I've spent the last 24 hours listening to this album 3 times.  This is quality music. And I'd better stop soon; but it's one of those albums, when listened to over again, yields new things you didn't hear the first time. I'm now going back to his old albums, and there are quite a few, to enjoy those.<br /><br />I'm not one to post over the top reviews, but I feel compelled here.<br /><br />Congratulations Mr. Wainwright, on differentiating yourself from many of the plastic one hit wonders of the world. The world needs more artists like you.

B00723NWJE|5.0|Until now I didn't know who Norah Jones was. But I'm glad I do now. She has introduced me to a new type of pop music, one that Norah Jones rules. Each song is beautifully crafted with her spectacular vocals and beautiful and vivid presentation of music. She has a smooth and at times raspy and sexy voice that she uses great. Now I'm gonna explain what I think of each song of this beautiful album.<br /><br />Good Morning:<br />Beautiful song sung over a slow strumming guitar. Its so calming and almost more of a goodnight song. I really enjoyed her vocals and the way she handeled the chords and the way she sung. 9/10<br /><br />Say Goodbye:<br />Has a jazz feel to it that sounds phenomenal. Its catchy and has very well written lyrics. Her voice is sharp and there is amazingly placed synth beats. 10/10<br /><br />Little Broken Hearts:<br />I really like this song. Everything about it. Very slow tempered.  Very calm but powerful, you can tell by this song that Norah has a amazing voice and performs and delivers everything amazingly. 9/10<br /><br />She's 22:<br />Slow tempered song about her ex falling for a young girl who's 22, very intricately laced lyrics and very well done music. A really good one. 9/10<br /><br />Take it Back:<br />A very well done song about wanting to take something back. Again has the same very good formula that makes great music. 8/10<br /><br />After the Fall:<br />We start to speed up and Norah's voice is spotless and perfect. This song is very good and super well produced. Also, kudos to whoever wrote it. 9/10<br /><br />4 Broken Hearts:<br />Slower, but still very good. Very good vocal performance. Spotless recording and mixing throughout. I really like this one. 7/10<br /><br />Travelin' On:<br />Slower one too. But is slow and makes you feel vulnerable like you wanna cry. Very well presented with emotion and top quality production. 10/10<br /><br />Out on the Road:<br />A song about escaping and just driving. Very good and the tempo is a little bit faster compared to the songs before being slower. 8/10<br /><br />Happy Pills:<br />A song that's very groovy and poppy. Its about being happy and being good to yourself. Very upbeat and again presents star vocal ability from Norah. 9/10<br /><br />Miriam:<br />Slower and in a way, its creepy and very good at the same time. Very slow and beautiful. Good lyrics. Great vocals. Just overall great song. 8/10<br /><br />All a Dream:<br />The conclusion to a fun and very well done album. Very slow and reminiscent. I like its instrumentation and clean vocals 9/10<br /><br />Overall, I really like this album and its very clean and well produced. Aswell as the music and Norah's amazing vocals. A must have. 9/10
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a great continuation of the foirst one. It was riveting and kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00756GKBA|3.0|Okay so here we are again with Madonna, while I wont say this album is bad. I will say that she did try too hard to modernize herself, and fit in. I think Madonna recorded MDNA with good intentions and it came out sour in a few ways. First of all she seeked help from new producers that are used to putting out new more poppy and modern songs. I love Madonna, especially her earlier works such as Like a Virgin. I think her earlier albums in the 2000's were really good and were different from the other artists in her lane, albums like American Life and Confessions on a Dance Floor, heck even Hard Candy, had a old soul sting to them that set them apart and helped her sell albums. MDNA is lacking this old soul quality and that's what makes it not so much of a improvement. Here's what I think of each song.<br /><br />Girl Gone Wild:<br />A fun, refreshing opening to MDNA. She does in a way carry the old soul quality in this song and this one that I like to go back and listen to. While it does sound modern she does incorporate stuff that make it extremely infectious and fun to jam to. 9/10<br /><br />Gang Bang:<br />Okay, imagine Madonna on acid, killing her abusive, cheating, husband. This describes Gang Bang. While i do enjoy it, sometimes it doesnt even seem like a song, more of a rant over a pumping club beat, still good though. 8/10.<br /><br />I'm Addicted:<br />This is one of the ones I don't really care for. She obviously tries way to hard, when she can rock out in her own caliber if she just goes and is herself. I just think she is drowned in over a club beat with pop and rock synths. It's still a okay song though. 6/10<br /><br />Turn Up The Radio:<br />Okay so we have what seems like a way too overdone song. In this one she actually sounds like shes trying to return to original form, but in a way fails. I mean its not a bad song, it's just okay. 7/10<br /><br />Give Me All Your Luvin'<br />Okay so we have the first single as performed on the Super Bowl and I actually will give this song consideration and props. I enjoy this one and its more in the middle of original form and overproduced modern pop. I love how she added in Nicki Minaj and MIA, They seem to help her in a way. This song actually helps the album alot. Recommended. 10/10<br /><br />Some Girls:<br />So here we go again, Madonna in overproduced crap. This is so not her. I can't even tell its her. Too much deep bass and she's somewhere in there drowning. She just cant pull it off. 5/10<br /><br />Superstar:<br />This one is okay, once you listen to it alot. It's kinda soothing and okay. I like it a little bit. But being completely blunt and honest its way too cookie cutter and sweet to be her. I mean I can listen through it. 7/10<br /><br />I Don't Give A:<br />Okay so this one is kinda like Give Me All Your Luvin' its okay, modern pop and she can pull this one off. Nicki Minaj provides a verse that helps the song a little bit. It's okay. It and Give Me All Your Luvin' might be my favorites on the MDNA album 8/10<br /><br />I'm a Sinner:<br />I don't really like this one, she just can't do this one. I just dont enjoy it. I feel like its a blatant attempt to set herself apart that obviously doesn't work. 5/10<br /><br />Love Spent:<br />This ones okay, really okay. I kinda like the country undertone, it adds. It's Madonna talking about love and money, which is something she does good on. 8/10<br /><br />Masterpiece:<br />Thank you Madonna! This is why i love you. You reel me right back in with this song. I love it, it's very like X-Static Process from American Life. Its really slow and reminiscent of past works and its actually good. Kudos on this song! 10/10<br /><br />Falling Free:<br />We close out MDNA on a completely different level, i really like the honestness of this song and the previous song. It really makes me from making this two stars instead of three. Falling Free and Masterpiece are my favorites. 10/10<br /><br />Overall, Madonna's MDNA is lukewarm for me, while some songs are very much earcandy, some of its pure crap. It's strong in some parts. Weak in others. 7/10<br /><br />~Matt
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I didn't mind having to wait for the energy level to replenish since I only play a few minutes here and there throughout the day. however the game crashed twice in the 2 weeks ive played this. once it crashes, all the buildings and animals reset to a time that is ridiculously long. the first time this happened to me, I had to wait 93hrs for something that was only 1min. this time around, it was 419hrs. I know the dev are trying to fix it, but I'm done waiting. its been a known problem for over a month on the forums. my attention span is short anyway so I'll probably end up forgetting about this game in a few days....definitely before the 400hrs I have to wait to play it.
B007BZM30M|5.0|Light, undeniably catchy, and tight beats. This is probably the best recent pop song i've heard. Phenomenal. Buy this, you wont regret it. It's only natural someone discovered by Justin Bieber could be so lyrical and poppy. Very reccomended. I even will buy the maxi single. Great song.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I've been waiting and waiting for another Montezuma game in app store.  Hours of fun for this 65 year old game player! thanks Amazon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was excellent...even better than the first.  I read it in one sitting in one day!I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the movie or book one.
0307592839|1.0|While the first chapter starts out with promise, a kleptomaniac who hasn't quite found her way in life, which has character, conflict, a story arc, nothing in the rest of the novel fulfills that promise.  The POVs and contexts shift so wildly it's as if we're looking at the wreckage without the benefit of having witnessed the wreck itself.  The result is that the only empathy I can muster is for a 12 year old girl who appears near the end of the novel through a series of PowerPoint slides.  She and her mother are the few characters with any heart or grit, which is why it makes me cranky to have to spend time in the heads of others I have a vague disdain for, who are ultimately, all gristle.  Even when I try to keep up with the cast of characters and their woes, very quickly, I have to admit I don't care.  I wouldn't have read past the second chapter if this weren't for a class where it was panned by all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great read! I had trouble putting it down. Once I got going on the hunger games, I read straight through the entire series in less than a week.
044042321X|3.0|I have read every book in this wonderful series, and was very excited when the graphic novel came out, right up until I read it. The very first thing I noticed were the misspelled words! At first it was slightly amusing, but quickly became annoying, and very obvious that they not have competent editors. I did not care for the artwork and felt it detracted from the story. The storyline was consistent with the book, but different interpretations  of various incidents from the book detracted the power of the story. I will read the next issue, but not be reading the issue after that unless serious changes are made.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|I'm a huge Michael Fassbender fan. He does a good job in this movie. I was surprised how good the story was--of course the topic of sex addiction can be fodder for entertainment, but this movie allows the viewer to care about the characters. It paints an unattractive view of what it's like to deal with this kind of thing. It doesn't hurt that Brandon is good-looking and successful. Carey Mulligan does a good job of the troubled sister. I was very pleased with this film.
0393088774|5.0|I've enjoyed Krugman's previous books and have been reading his New York Times blog for the past five years now because, quite frankly, he's been almost always right about major economic policies. In this book, Krugman lays out the case for spending more money in order to pull the economy out of its economic doldrums quickly and with as little pain as possible to regular Joes/Janes like you and me.<br /><br />Krugman's point isn't that the U.S. government should ALWAYS spend lots of money (or \\"print\\" lots of money, as some angry reviewers have put it). Krugman's argument is that in a recession where the Federal Reserve can't lower its rates any further, the government MUST continue spending money. The alternative is called austerity, and that policy is having disastrous effects in Europe even as we speak. Why? Because when the government cuts spending, it's cutting JOBS.<br /><br />Krugman lays out his argument in the book on government spending and a higher inflation target, which--again!--he clearly states isn't supposed to be permanent or by any means debilitating. He also discusses the economic discussions that have thrown us back into this \\"Dark Age\\" where previously debunked theories have now become the mainstream way of thinking. In his sections on the ramifications of an economic depression, Krugman also points out just how much suffering goes along with these periods and makes a strong case for ensuring that our government does everything it can to pull the economy back on track. Learning from the mistakes of the Obama administration is a good thing and could help us in the future ... and Krugman has no problem pointing out President Obama's economic mistakes.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book even if you disagree with Krugman's policy prescriptions. Why? Because he's been right so far, and the people who have given this book negative reviews seem to have no idea what the book is actually about.
B001C4CI8U|2.0|The style simarities with \\"Lost\\" are very strong. Picture that with only 3 main characters and the Sci-Fi aspect cranked way up. Being this is the first season I hope it gets better.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|its basically gamelofts version of angry birds, but its also different in many ways. I prefer it over angry birds. I would definitely recommend buying it.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I enjoyed the books but I would have preferred it if they had been downloaded to my Kindle as 4 seperate books instead of 1 continuous textfile in which all 4 books are combined. The table of contents is not much help in finding anything in the books, which makes looking up things even more difficult. You can also not refer to pages, because they continue on through the four books instead of starting from 1 for each seperate book. So yeah, all in all I think having the 4 seperate books would have been better and easier to manage.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun and there are games for everyone. most people say that it is bad but it is good. and it is free! so if you want fun buy this game. @
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a decent game,  but I have to agree with a lot of other reviews and say that the controls are pretty bad making it difficult to complete some games.
0345803485|5.0|First of all, I would like to state that everyone is entitled to their opinions, hence why I am taking the time to leave my own. However, I feel that the attack on this book is a little harsh and some of the reviews I want to scream at. Do I agree that this was not the best written book ever? yes. However, keep in mind that author's write to an audience of people. A book that readers can relate to and I feel that this book did it. As far as the feminist outcry over this book, I hate to ask it ladies, but really? Are you blind to the fact that Annastasia Steele is a very strong female character exploring her own sexuality and consents to everything that Mr. Grey wants to try. Her strength as a character changes Mr. Grey into something he never thought he would be or their relationship into something he has never had. Also, for those who say it is badly written, what more does the story need? Ana communicates with her readers through her inner dialogue and talks as any college graduate would. E L James connection with music and classic literature shows her appreciation for the arts. Christian Grey is a very complex character who was dealt a bad hand of cards and depends on a woman (without acknowledging it)to fight his demons. There is clever word play, humor, eroticism, love, and sympathy and the author does a good job at hitting all these emotions. It left me wanting more and now I am on the second book of the series. As far as the lack of communication during sex, think about how limited your vocabulary is when you are having sex. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who wants to explore the realm of erotic fiction. It is very enticing and will make you wonder why!
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|This was a great movie, my only complaint was they might as well had Irish people play Hawaiian descendants because Clooney no where resembles any Hawaiian blood, let a lone royalty. Not to mention his male family members that tried to get him to sell his land, including Beau Bridges, who looks no where near like his relative, let alone Hawaiian. As for the movie, it was awesome. Me being born and raised in Hawaii, thought the characters they chose where the wrong choice. I have many 'watered' down Hawaiian relatives with some being only a smidge Hawaiian, and they look full blooded still! Other than that, this movie had a wonderful story to tell, the emotions that took place, the hate, the love the mystery. Great story being told here.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|frankly, im amazed that this book even got published. It was recommended to me my  practically everyone i knew, so i went ahead and gave it a shot. Boy, were they wrong. The first (at least) 1/3 of the book, absolutely nothing happened. I find Katniss to be extremely unlikable, shes very flat, but at times can also be overly-dramatic. The story is crudely violent, and not very well written. I would not suggest this book to anyone; unless theyre looking for an un-original snoozefest.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|There are other reviews here that give a good description of what happens in the movie. I just wanted to add my 5 stars to the group. If you are not troubled by blood and violence but love a good laugh this movie is for you. I expected a bad flick considering the title but was pleased to find otherwise. Heartily recommended for the unsquimish who enjoy a good comedy. It's not fine art -- just good entertainment. Isn't that what we want for our money?
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I haven't been stuck in the game. if can work your kindle you can get out of the game. this game is fine as long as you like a basic farmville game. perfect for all kids.
0345803485|4.0|Good read. Very sexy, almost pornographic. Mommy Porn. Not that well written but fun to read anyways.Everybody on the train is reading this
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this has to be the most additive game ever. I play draw something on my kindle fire. you have to finger paint a picture, you have to pick one of 3 choices.  every mistake u make your opponents sees even if you erase it. that's what makes it so fun. we play this as a family taking turns passing my kindle around. fun for ALL AGES!
0553801473|5.0|A huge improvement from the last book.  A lot more dragon & dire wolf action. As usual there are a few disappointments but as always I only want to start reading the next book.

0345803485|5.0|I am kicking myself for not buying all three at one time.  I am now forced to wait until the second and third come in. Love this book. I am going to reread it until the others come in!!!! Anyone who doesn't like it .... Well I just don't know what to say about them.

B0073Q0DZG|5.0|I really liked this film. It wasn't a typical Hollywood implementation, although the story and setup could be considered familiar. Three very different people attempt to accomplish the same thing for different reasons.<br /><br />The performances are very natural, the pace is entertaining-- nearly driving. At some points I found myself literally on the edge of my seat, rooting for one thing or another to happen, hoping one character or another would follow through... I laughed. I nearly cried.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film.<br /><br />Some reviews have suggested this film is unrealistic. I disagree. It's completely conceivable. Travel is not always as expensive as one thinks. Priority is key, but who cares, anyway? The characters were normal, moderate, like human beings. They didn't fly from one end of the emotional spectrum to the next. They weren't caricatures. This movie was sweet. It was hopeful. It was genuine. The portrayals of everyone were kind.<br /><br />I'm so glad I ignored the bad reviews here and gave it a whirl. I'm not a birder, but I think the story is bigger than that. It's about aiming for something. It's about balance. It's about love and really living.<br /><br />It's a great movie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The bravery and sacrifices our Navy sailors make day in and out for us is remarkable! A SEA STORY, AMERICAN SNIPER and LONE SURVIVOR...hats off to the sailors in these great american novels.

B004OSPTSM|5.0|I'm an uneducated heathen who hadn't yet read any Austen (or anything from the [[ASIN:0143105833 Bronte sisters]], either, so I really do mean it when I say that I'm an uneducated heathen).  A few months ago, Fab had a great sale of Penguin editions of various classics, and so I decided to pick up some of the classic works of literature for my library.  And, being an uneducated heathen, I knew utterly nothing about this book when I started reading it.<br /><br />And I loved it.  It's a story of class issues, and first impressions, and changing your mind.  It's a story with a strong female lead and a male lead who admires her for her strength and her intelligence.  It's a story about bad decisions and good ones.  It's a story about defying expectations.<br /><br />The frontmatter by the Penguin folks mentioned [[ASIN:1108018858 A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]], so that just got bumped up in my reading queue to better understand the history of feminism.
0439023491|2.0|I was really dissappointed that this book was a repeat of the first book. The author could have put the last chapter of this book onto the end of the first book and saved me some money. I hope \\"Mockingjay\\" makes up for this; I'll let you know.
B007HJ84ZK|2.0|I tried watching this show because so many people have compared it to Lord of the Rings. However, that comparison is superficial at best. Like LOTR, the producers of Game of Thrones did a good job recreating Medieval style costumes and scenery. That's about the only similarity.<br /><br />In terms of the plot and characters - what really matters - the two couldn't be more different. LOTR has an epic story of war and morality, with fascinating characters and deep character studies. Game of Thrones, by contrast, seems to be populated by a bunch of losers and whores. I've watched 2 episodes - got too bored to finish - and couldn't detect anything resembling an interesting story. There's a few minutes of mysterious blue-eyed monsters killing people in the first episode (what I thought were lousy special effects), but most of the series seems to focus around the drama of the king's family.<br /><br />Even after 2 hours of watching, I barely remembered any of the characters' names, much less cared about them. Except for Sean Bean's character, they all seem equally annoying. The only point I got excited was when I thought the little girl was going to kill the obnoxious blond kid (alas, she didn't). Unlike Tolkien's Hobbits, the series doesn't have a point of view character who pulls the viewer into the world, making it tough to invest in the characters. This is especially problematic when there are so many characters, most of who fail to make much of an impression.<br /><br />On another note, HBO seems obsessed with sex and violence in its shows. As a matter of artistic preference, I don't have a problem with explicit sex or violence scenes, but only if they serve the story or character development. However, in Game of Thrones, the directors certainly weren't subtle in their cinematography. At times, I felt like I was watching a porno - I felt embarrassed to be watching it with my wife. Much of it seemed thrown in there for the sake of titillating audiences when a far moresubtle approach would have served just as well.<br /><br />I haven't read the book so I don't know whether the HBO series is doing it justice. However, I'd warn fans of LOTR and other fantasy classics that they'll likely find Game of Thrones disappointing. It's too bad - with the sort of money HBO has, it has the ability to create a genuine fantasy epic TV show, but instead we get Desperate Housewives in a Medieval setting.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Good way to pass the time if you really need to.  Very addictive and challenging.  I use it when I'm stuck waiting for a dentist or doctor or the DMV.
B007C9N4H8|3.0|Needed better choreography or at least more complex choreography.  The best part was the Muppet Show towards the end of the movie.  The movie suffered from a bad script/story up until that point.  The whole human/muppet brother back story was kind of lame.  This movie could have and should have been better.

0393088774|5.0|This is a great, fact-based argument for how we turn global and national economics around. It's also a valuable analysis of why this hasn't happened so far, both economically and politically/socially.<br /><br />Krugman has written a few textbooks on economics, but it's nice to see this digestible while still fact-based, and rigorously argued book on what must be the most important issue affecting the world.<br /><br />Cheers!

B0072GPQNG|5.0|We enjoyed this movie so much that, when it came out of DVD, we bought it.  It is a great story of a young man's love for his horse, the ravages of war, and a noble horse who comes back to the young man after an arduous journey through the battlefields of war.  I recommend it to everyone who asks us to recommend a movie.

006197806X|5.0|This book was nothing short of amazing.  The beginning was a little confusing and slow as it flips back from the past and the present, but half way through I really got back into it and could not put it down until I finished!  I was wondering if she was going to put my mind to ease with several things that she left open from the first book, but by the very last page she will do just that!  I can NOT wait for next spring so I can finish the trilogy!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This app is so addicting and fun. Using it my kindle fire and I can't seem to get friend invites. People have left feedback about not being able to exit.. All you do to get out is to go to the settings and then the bottom bar comes up. Other than that it has been an awesome game.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I originally downloaded this for my 4 y.o. because she wanted to help with another one of my &quot;...Village&quot; apps. With my other app she was constantly asking what/when she could build, feed, buy, etc. and she would get frustrated at the amount of &quot;saving&quot; required to start goals and the length of time most of the tasks take to complete. In her Ice Age Village nothing takes very long and you are rewarded for EVERY completed task with an amount of coins almost equal to the amount spent to start it. I enjoyed it so much while helping her figure things out that I downloaded it on a second device for myself!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|After being told by a close friend that I \\"MUST\\" read the Fifty Shades of Grey books and seeing them at the TOP of the Download Best Sellers list, I thought Ok, let's go for it.  Normally, I don't like books with such graphic scenes and language in them.  However, once you start reading about the characters, E.L. James hooks you into needing to know, \\"What happens next?\\"  Granted, the story of a regular girl meets an outstanding, rich boy has been told before, but never with the specific twists that this author uses.  I enjoyed it so much, that I not only told all of my friends about it, I purchased a couple of copies and gave them to my friends.  My husband said if he knew the books would have the effect on me that they have, he would have bought a gross of them and handed them out to all of his friends for them to give to their wives.  Fifty Shades of Grey is truly a Mom's Guilty Pleasure worth staying up late to read and enjoy!

1451648537|3.0|Not one for half measures, Jobs wanted Einstein's biographer to write his life.  I think Isaacson couldn't resist the access, but should have held off on publication.  Its too soon to form an opinion on Jobs impact.  The  boom, bust, boom again story is not played out yet.  Apple, the company, could take over the planet, or fade like Sony or something in between;  Mobile computing and digitization of media experiences have definitely been popularized by Steve Jobs, but where will it go now?  Too soon to tell, I think.<br />The tale is well told, Jobs characters flaws - volatile,obsessive, inspiring - are unvarnished.  The comments from his family seem very realistic,  its not quite said, but it seems to me he was very tight with money.  Isaascson's direct observations of Jobs are mostly acute, but sometimes banal - or is he mocking us when he describes what music Jobs had on his iPod? The comments of non-family members in the book seem to me to be, to varying degrees self-serving, basking in some kind of reflected glory.  I saw a Charlie Rose interview with Eric Schmidt in the days following Jobs death, and even I could tell that it was puke-inducing pap.  A lot of Job's colleagues  anecdotes in the book have the same feel.<br />I got the book for Christmas, and I was reading it as the new Korean dictator - son of the former Korean dictator - was being presented to the people.  He seemed a bit overwhelmed.  I felt that Tim Cook's role is a bit similar, how do you follow in the footsteps of someone whose whim's became decisions, and whose whims changed in a heart-beat?  The book contains  many stories about designs having to be completely changed when Jobs, usually at the eleventh hour, says something along the lines of `I'm sorry, I just don't love it'.<br />I read the book primarily to get some detail on the pricing decisions behind iTunes, a truly remarkably audacious piece of marketing I think - how do you price a product, that is being given away free (if illegally)?  However I didn't find much beyond anecdote about this, and much in a similar vein with other business decisions.<br />Overall an interesting read, but it's possible that ten years from now we will have the same feeling about Jobs as we do now about Princess Diana.  Overall, I think this book will feel very dated in five/ten  years time.
B004UID2LC|3.0|its a great app but on my kindle I only get to watch like 2 videos and then it crashes on me its really annoying but its still a good app that's probably cud its on the kindle but overall I do recomend it but not to kindle users
0446541478|3.0|Israel is super-competitive because Israeli's are intensely inquisitive, constantly challenge authority and accepted wisdom and remain under imminent threat of annihilation.  This is what I take away from this book.  There are good examples of innovative companies, mainly in the High Technology, who provide the backbone of innovation in the country.  And innovation is the reason I read the book, it's the current magic ingredient which will bring economic growth, which will solve all our problems; so surely the lessons we can learn from the innovative Israeli's will be valuable.<br />Some lessons were unsurprising - constant experimentation, re-evaluation of results, direct criticism; some were surprising - a significant industrial policy was seen as a good thing.  There is some mention of the immigration, however I thought the impact of demographics was insufficiently explored.  Imagine the impact of your population being expanded by nearly 20%, and that a significant proportion of these people were well educated and impoverished.<br />Overall I thought the book was readable, though not very useful.  I think waves of immigration have been a spur to economic development throughout history,  I don't buy the ` threat of annihilation as the mother of invention' theme, I do agree that Israeli's in general are argumentative, critical and sometimes irreverent; however i think the book ignored the fact that they are also disciplined and persistent.  I though the book was journalistic in the sense of telling stories to illustrate points is useful, but if analysis points to areas where stories are hard to tell, then the book falls down.  At the end I thought it told the same story again and again, relentlessly.

0393338827|1.0|Micheal Lewis writes very wittily and well.  He is gifted with the ability to make finance interesting and to enliven the characters.  I enjoy reading his books and articles, this one somewhat less than the rest.  He describes the machinations of those (few) who predicted the real-estate and financial crash of 08 and the reactions of the various banks - he is particular good on the disdain that the bankers have for the regulators.  My main problem is that there is an air of knowingness which is patently false, its easy to know now that the majority opinion is completely wrong.  But the tone drove me to google a pre-bust Lewis article in which he ridiculed Rubini with the same off-hand ease that he rubbishes almost everyone in The Big Short.  In the very end of the book, Lewis has lunch with John Gutfreund, who was Lewis's boss during his brief financial career in the 1980's, Lewis ridiculed Gutfreund in his breakthrough book - Liar's Poker.  Needless to say the lunch does not lead to any mutual understanding.  I found this part unnecessarily self-indulgent, somehow trying to vindicate Lewis by saying that all Wall Street players are greedy, heedless and dim.  Read Zuckerman or Sorkin on this topic instead
B006OB3K56|2.0|[SPOILERS AHEAD] First two-thirds of the film? Fairly riveting and very well acted. The final third? So far-fetched and ridiculous that I have to give the entire film a thumbs-down. I think it's a copout when a writer has to kill someone off to add gravity to a story, as if what was originally on the page wasn't enough. Why can't this JUST be about a guy's sex addiction? Added to that, the part where our main character metaphorically and literally crosses the street to have (shame of shames!) sex with another man because he's so desperate for sex (complete with swelling score to underline his depravity) is nothing less than backhanded homophobia - not to mention just plain lazy storytelling. Despite its documentary-like camerawork and hipster, fly-on-the-wall pseudo-realism, this film's sensibilities are clearly rooted in 1950s melodrama.

0345803485|3.0|I'm honestly 50/50 on this trilogy.  I read them all in 4 days.  I will say I wasn't happy with the ending at all.  I think she had an opportunity to walk away from the sex and turn it into a great suspense novel, but fell very short of that.<br /><br />While I've read people complaining about how it was written/what words were used, the naivete of Anastasia explains why there weren't more synonyms for sexual organs.  If she's never been around the block, how is she to know all the different words and phrases she could be using?  It got old after a while, but it didn't bother me.<br /><br />Not knowing the ins & outs of the BDSM world, I will go with my gut and say the author did some extensive research on this lifestyle.  One I don't care to get involved in, and now I know why!  More often than not you read Christain saying \\"I'm going to...\\", which seems a little too technical-we know what is coming next.  But I can only assume this is part of Dom/Sub lifestyle as well?<br /><br />People also wonder why this book is so popular, given they (and others) don't like it.  Well, the purchasing of the book(s) alone is what has made it so overwhelmingly popular.  It doesn't matter if you finish reading it-what matters is that you bought it.<br /><br />Had the author taken a different course of action by book #3 I may have rated it better.  All in all, it was a page turner (to me), and I couldn't wait to read what was going to happen next (aside from the obvious sex).

0439023513|5.0|If you were expecting a \\"Twilight ending,\\" the odds were definitely not in your favor.<br />\\"Mockingjay\\" is shockingly dark, painfully real, and horribly devastating. There is no sugar-sweet ending where everyone survives to live a blissful \\"happily ever after.\\"That being said, it is an amazing closing to the Hunger Games trilogy. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down until I finished it.<br />When I finally did close the book, I felt numb. In four hours of reading, I had lost almost every character that I had emotionally invested in. Good became evil and evil became even more evil until I actually found myself wishing for the \\"good old days\\" of the Hunger Games where everything was simple. Where I knew who the good guys were.<br />It wasn't until I was a good ways into the book that I realized that \\"Mockingjay\\" was not going to be like the first two books. Above all, it's a story about war and its harsh realities as seen through the eyes of KatnissEverdeen. Everyone loses something. Almost everyone loses everything. Characters who you thought you knew seem to change overnight. While some readers may criticize the changes, I think that the changes in the characters ultimately make the characters even more real.<br />It seems as if there will be no ending to the horrors. But they do come to an end and the few survivors are left to pick up the pieces. But it's not the same. They are not the same. There is no going back to who they were before. They have been scarred physically, mentally, and emotionally. Over time, their wounds have healed but the scars will never go away. But they slowly move forward.It is not the ending that anyone would ever wish for or want but it is enough. In the end,Collins gives us \\"the promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again.\\"

0307352145|5.0|Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain is a great book that helps to show the power of introversion and how those of us who are introverts can excel. This is a book that should be read by everyone, including extroverts, so that the workings of an introvert can be seen and more respect and understanding given. In a world where the extrovert rules, it is hard to see how someone listening instead of talking can be of any importance but we find example after example of how many of the most pivotal inventions and ideas of our time were done by introverts.<br /><br />The one thing that really stood out to me was how introverts are labeled as shy and quiet but there are categories to an introvert just as there are categories to extroverts. Some introverts are able to speak publicly but they need some time alone to \\"recharge\\" themselves while others are too shy to be at a party. Still others like to think on a situation before making any decisions so one thing that is highly important is to explain this to those we deal with so that misunderstandings do not follow. Cain also highlights how to use the strengths of introversion to make the decisions that need to be made and to help introverts use their unique perspectives to improve situations instead of being trampled on by fast moving ideas.<br /><br />The research that went into this book to bring a concise and understandable explanation on how introverts work is phenomenal and it helps to show the importance of introversion in today's society. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking has helped me to understand how to use my introversion and, being an introvert herself,  Susan Cain helps show introversion in a positive light where contributions can be, and have been, made by introverts.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review. My thoughts and opinions for this review are my own.

0345803485|3.0|I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Morning talk shows have been going on and on about this book, but frankly it's not nearly as scintillating as they say. As far as steamy sex books go, it's average. If you really want something to knock your socks off, and your panties, try the Riley Jensen series,Laurel K. Hamilton's series, or the Children of the Goddess series. Granted, these are sexy scifi books, but they're worth the read! Even Lisa Lorello's \\"Faking It\\" could give this book a run for it's money.<br /><br />On a more positive note, there is something about this book that gets under your skin. The writing isn't fantastic, and E.L. James should invest in a Thesaurus, but I often find the relationship between the two main characters making me smile in spite of myself. I'm half way through the second book, and I already know I'll purchase the third, despite the ridiculous Kindle price. The only real issue I have is that this book is entirely too similar to the movie The Secretary with James Spader and Maggie Gyllanhaal. The main characters' last names are even the same! It's almost as if the author watched the movie and then wrote the books. Disappointing. I honestly can't decide if I'd recommend this book. Maybe borrow it from the library before purchasing the remaining two.
B007MJKOY4|3.0|I really liked the idea of this movie -- but the way it played out was very slow.  I generally like movies that take time to develop a thorough story line, but this just plain dragged on.  It's okay, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B005723JSQ|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella.  However, this book fails miserably.  I couldn't wait to get thru it.  The writing wasn't funny or witty, it was just down right annoying.  In fact, I think the author is starting to lose her touch.  Or rather she's just rehashing the same character over and over again.  And what was once humorous and cute is becoming old and boring.  I loved the first three Shopaholic books as well as, \\"Can you keep a secret?\\".  But, her last three books with this one being the worse, there's definitely a noticeable decline in the writing.

1469984202|5.0|That's an aerial shot of 25 stars, ok? And that book, you think it's just another sci fi book? Ha! It's easily better than any of the books on the 2012 Arthur C. Clarke shortlist. Howey writes the technical stuff and the Great Concept stuff and the plot twists like it's nothing and unforgettable characters drive the stories. The buzz I get from reading Howey is like the buzz I got discovering Heinlein, who also did those things. But no, Howey's pacing is faster, his emotional range is wider and deeper, his ear for dialogue is Cohen-Brothers-worthy, and his plot twists are stunners. If you think it's impossible to imbue post-apocalyptic fiction with a sensawunda, I dare you to read this book.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I'll admit, when I watched the first episode of Legend of the Seeker on Netflix I was deeply disappointed. I had almost finished the first book in the Sword of Truth series Wizard's First Rule and I watched in horror as the story that it had taken me 800+ pages to read was almost all but given away in under an hour of only the first episode of the series. It left me to wonder how on earth they could have a story worth telling if everything was already revealed AND altered quite a bit. Needless to say, it took me a while to start up the second episode but let me tell you I am SO GLAD that I did.<br /><br />Once you separate the show from the books you'll be pleasantly entertained and swept off your feet by this series and its colorful assortment of characters. In each episode Richard and his faithful friends are faced with a new adventure and must overcome yet another obstacle that stands between them and their true goal. To defeat Darken Rahl.<br /><br />Now, as a kid I LOVED watching shows like Xena Warrior Princess and Hercules so I rather enjoyed the fact that this series had qualities not unlike those shows. The witty humor, the action scenes, maybe even a bit corny at times but still very enjoyable. Its a series that is entertaining whether you've read the books or not. The characters are lovable and dare I say it, captivating.<br /><br />Before picking up this series I had never seen Craig Horner in any other films or TV shows, mostly because this was his breakout role. And man am I happy it was. (This is the part where I let my infatuation with Craig Horner take the reins for a bit, so bare with me). Every good story needs a good hero. Richard/Horner plays a hero that you can't help but root for. He's kind and forgiving but he's merciless when it comes to fighting for what he believes in. And in truth he played this role REALLY well. If I had to formulate an idea of what Richard was like in my mind I don't think it would be as true to character as Craig Horner was able to portray. Need I mention how attractive he is? I mean, some episodes wowed me more than others, I'll be honest, but Horner never let me down in the swoon-worthy department.<br /><br />Before I get even more sidetracked I have to say that as far as entertainment goes this series never let me down. Maybe it's not entirely true to the book but that's something you have to expect from a television adaptation. And I would argue that if it had been given the proper publicity the series would have gone on longer than its mere two seasons.r was able to portray. Need I mention how attractive he is?

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hunger Games: a novel of the future, in which children are pitted against children, for the amusement of the 1%. Surely civilization will never sink to such depths, but then, many people thought the Holocaust could never happen.<br /><br />It seem to me the basic tenant of the book is that the masses, the 99%, provide entertainment for the remaining 1%. This may or may not be true. My personal feeling is that the 1% gives the 99% what they want (the NFL, NASCAR< the NBA, etc). In return the 1% takes what they want (money , power, Wall Street, law firms, etc). So far, the trade seems to be working: the obscenely wealthy are getting more wealthy, and the NFL and NASCAR are more popular than ever. Thus, the story line, that children will be pitted against children, for the amusement of the 1%, seems to not stand up to comparison with observation.<br /><br />This book is also,in conjunction with other books in the series, a movie. It's one of the most poplar movies ever made, if  the press notices are to be believed. People are flocking to it; screen are sold out. People like to see other people threatened with injury and death, and survive. Escapism; the good guys win or survive (in this case,a n girl and boy), while the bad guys (in this case some fat kids from the city) lose. These stories used to be called \\"man against the elements\\" or \\"Cowboy movies\\". Would we read the Odyssey if Jason had drowned somewhere? would \\"Shane\\" be as good a movie if Shane had been killed in that bar room shoot near the end? No to both questions. Unfortunately, the fact that people are streaming to this movie is a tacit admission that the tenet of the boo, is probably correct.<br />If you admit you're one of the 99% being controlled and manipulated by te 1%, see the movie, read the book.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|alright.. my only excuse for not giving these 5 stars is that I dont like the raspy-ness when listening to vocals. it could be because im used to the sony mdr 300's which have lower mid-high frequency range... I might have to give them more time to grow on me because they came in about an 2 hour ago.. Im fine with everything else. has a full sound. I dont like the wiring though because it does that spinning thing you see on old home phones.. but I dont intend to use these outside of my home though so Im not mad at it. actually adds some distance so thats cool.

B007OUFESC|3.0|A Dangerous Method is the \\"Holllywoodized\\" telling of the real life relationships of three founding figures in psychology: Karl Jung (Michael Fassbender), Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen), and Sabina Spielrein (Kira Knightly). In particular, the focus of the movie is on the supposed BD-SM affair between Speielein and Jung, which hi-jacks what could have been a potentially great movie and turns it into just another treatment on the \\"sexually repressed\\" victorian era. I don't know your impression of this genre of movie (it has become a genre in my mind), but it seems that whenever a period piece about the 1800's is made, some how it has to have kink or sexually repressed characters or the movie will not be produced.<br /><br />I thought the acting was good by all three actors, in particular Kira Knightly. Mortensen was very convincing an older Freud (who was much older than himself). The sets, props and costumes were authentic and the cinematography was good.<br /><br />What I wanted to get from the movie was perhaps a little more than what Hollywood was willing to give. I wanted to learn more about the methods and differences between Jung's approach in comparison to Freud. There was just enough of that to keep me watching through Kira Knightly having her bare ass spanked with a paddle.

B004EPYZUS|2.0|So when I heard this movie was coming out, my first thought was 'isn't Tom Cruise getting too old for this?' I had no desire to go to the theater to see it or purchase it on DVD.  I ended up watching it because a friend rented out of a red-box thing.  Anyway, I was bored out of my mind.  After the initial action sequence, I passed the time by searching for and downloading new games to my phone to keep me busy.  Sure it had action, hence the 2 stars, but the long drawn -out plot was snoozville.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|This version of UNO is passable but is definitely skewed against the 'live'player. I don't expect to win the majority of the time. But the game severely limits my options. When one of my Kindle-generated opponents plays a Plus-4 card I have challenged it dozens of times. Without exception I have received the 'Challenge Failed' message even though my opponents are allowed to challenge successfully. The game also allows my opponents to challenge a player who gets down to one card but doesn't allow me to do this. Once in a great while - and I mean great while - the Kindle allows me to get a few points but very seldom lets me actually win. Very frustrating.

0345803485|2.0|I had to see what all the fuss was about this book.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, it sucked.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to think about this book, and while the story was great, turning from a sexual arrangement into something that kind of resembled the beginnings of love, the author had to go and ruin the story at the end. Quite disappointing.<br /><br />On the back cover, it's called an 'Erotic Romance'. That it is...well, that is, up until the end. Excuse me, Miss James, but your ending sucked!<br /><br />The story begins with Anastasia Steele going to the business office of a very young, handsome billionaire to interview him for the school newspaper. She's only doing this because her friend, Kate, is ill. When she meets Christian Grey, she is mesmerized by his looks, his demeanor and his power.<br /><br />Christian is very over-powering to Ana, and she feels compelled to do whatever he wants. He is a Dominent. He wants her to be his Submissive. He gives her a contract to look over and sign, if she so wishes. She is unsure about signing the contract, as she has her own \\"rules\\" she wishes him to abide by as well.<br /><br />He 'gives' into her want of something more than just sex, because he starts having feelings for her. He realizes that she is as mesmerizing and as amazing to him as he is to her. But, the secrets he holds bother Ana. He has difficulty opening up to her, to tell him why he needs to cause her pain, and she feels the need to know everything about him.<br /><br />He lavishes gifts on her that are unwanted, and sexually, they have an amazing relationship. But, Ana wants more...she wants him to cuddle her, to sleep with her in the same bed instead of leaving her after he has had his way with her. When she gives him what he wants, allowing him to restrain her, and to use his many \\"toys\\" on her, he starts giving in and giving her the more that she wants.<br /><br />When his secrets are revealed at the end, Ana understands that she can never be what he wants her to be, to do the things that he wants to do to her, so she leaves.<br /><br />I can't reveal what his secrets are. You'll have to read the book for that. However, I will say that if you do not like erotic books, then don't read this. If you don't like bondage, restraining, anything involving pain (regardless of whether it's used in a sexual way or to \\"punish\\" someone), then don't get this book.<br /><br />I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I started reading this book...and while I've read my fair share of erotic stories/books, this one actually had some substance to it.<br /><br />Ok, so the book wasn't bad...it was the ending that sucked. How can this book be called a romance when the romance died emotionally, physically and everything inbetween, at the end? With just a few pages to go, I thought Christian and Ana were going to declare their love for one another, that she had broken him of some of his wanting to 'hurt' her. By the last page, I wanted to dump the novel in the trash. It sucked. I'm truly pissed off about it because I wanted the proverbial happy ending. Does that make it a good book because I'm pissed off? Not in my books.<br /><br />I have another reason for hating this book...the author must have gotten a new thesaurus for Christmas because there were so many words in the book that I had to look up in the dictionary. One or two words I found in the book, weren't even in the dictionary.<br /><br />So, disappointment has found me because I really thought that I was going to love this book. I'm giving this book 2 stars. This book lost one star for being so hyped up that I wanted to buy it, one star for the lousy ending, and the third star for me having to spend so much time looking up stupid words like phelgmatically, which isn't even a word according to the dictionary.<br /><br />This book sucks.

0553582038|4.0|During the past year I've read through the first three books of the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series and really enjoyed every book with every dirty scheme building in the background and every plot twist. I did also enjoy \\"A Feast for Crows\\", but to a much lesser extent. It just didn't seem like many important events were happening, especially compared to the last book. I suppose this can be blamed on the fact that this book originally wasn't even planned on being written, but there were still other problems. The biggest problem is the huge amount of POV characters in this book. It would be perfectly fine if all of them were actually important to the progressing story, but so many of them only have a couple chapters or less and overall don't seem very important to the story. There are three different Greyjoy chapters, and each character is so close to the other that it seems more worthwhile to just have a single Greyjoy. Also, in the last book I was really beginning to like Jaime's character and I still do, but every time there's a Jaime chapter in this book, it's also followed by an annoying Cersei chapter. She is the most annoying character in this book, literally all she does in her chapters are whine and argue with Jaime, until near the end of the book where she actually becomes important. However, even with these negatives, I did enjoy this book. There definitely were interesting parts and just as many plot twists as the previous books. Some of the new POV characters were fun to read about as well, and the ending definitely leaves you extremely confused and makes you ready to jump on to the next book. Overall, it can be a fairly slow read, but beneath the negatives it really is a good book, especially since you've probably read the past three and want to know what's happening with all the characters you love.

It can be a very slow read and sometimes even plain boring at times. However, I'm going to blame this on the fact that this book wasn't originally going to be written like the last, and hope for the next book to redeem the greatness of the series. First, there are too many useless POV's just like the last book, and if you look at AFFC and ADWD as a single book as it was intended to be published as, then the number of POV's double from the third book. I'm not saying that every new POV was pointless, because I did enjoy a few and they did help to progress the story for the most part. I was happy that he brought back Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys' chapters back in this book as they've easily become my favorite characters, and many important events surround them in this book. So, cool stuff does happen and I did enjoy this book, but it didn't change the fact that it was a much slower read than the first three in the series. The ending, of course, left us on a cliffhanger for several characters, and I can't wait for the next book, but I do hope that it cuts out pointless content, returns to the main story, and continues to entice me as the first three did. Overall, it was a decent book, but mainly for fans of the series who have followed it through, due to how slow it can be to read at times.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|originally posted on GoodReads.com:<br /><br />I had to think pretty hard before giving this review. It baffles me to see a book with such high ratings get so many conflicting reviews here on GoodReads. Maybe some of those that gave it a high rating were too scared to give their reasons why. I was thrilled to give my five stars, but as I read through some of the reviews, I kind of got embarrassed. I also saw the same disgust on the discussion board for this book. Was I not supposed to like this? Does it make me look like a freaky nympho? But then I thought about E.L. James and how she must have worried what will people think of her at some point. She had some serious guts to write this book. So courageous to share her vision of this story with the world. So here I am, gladly giving this book 5 stars and I will also be courageous in giving my reasons why. If you found the book horrendous, then judge away. I do not mind.<br /><br />Let me start with...There are some spoilers. I'm not super direct with them, but if you are sensitive to spoilers, please proceed with caution. I don't spill what happens in the end. And If you have read some spoilers, don't worry, it's still very worth it, get the book. The sex scenes sell!<br /><br />I couldn't relate to Ana much at all, but found myself jealous of her. What really kept the pages turning for me was Christian. What a crazy awesome character! The mystery behind him had me intrigued - where he came from, his early life, how he came to be who he is, why he does what he does. Christian had a really hard early childhood and it really has messed with his head and has ruined his chance at having a relationship in what society sees as normal. I've seen it asked several times by the folks who haven't read this book, yes, there is a lot of sexual BDSM in great detail. It's all Christian knows and it fulfills his need. It seems like a lot of people that were put off, don't really understand the lifestyle. Although I haven't been in this type of relationship before, I can understand most of it, especially all that Christian is into. He's a powerful man in many ways and many women love powerful men. He's ridiculously rich and is used to having anything and anyone he wants. He gets it with a snap of his fingers. What he wants is Ana, and she defys him. She plays games and it drives him crazy. He can't easily have what he wants all of the time. That makes the desire greater....so much so that he tries so hard to change for her to keep her. All of a sudden, there is a shift in power. Even though she doesn't realize it, she makes the rules and he bends over backwards to make sure she's happy.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed to see readers hate Christian like he's a villain. I thought he was more than fair. First, he tells her he is no good for her in hopes she will run away. She does not leave. After that, he tells her straight up front that he is a dominate man and explains that to her. She does not leave. He shows her the playroom. She does not leave. He gives her the contract to read. She does not leave. He tells her to take a week to read over it. She does not leave. He tells her she can negotiate the majority of the contract. She does not leave. Then he says the contract is not even legally binding and she can leave whenever she wants. She does not leave. He changes so much for her and tries so hard at giving her \\"more,\\" which is what she wants. She knows he has a past that makes him the way he is and he works hard dealing with it. So......why is he the villain to readers? She kept going for it. She asked for it. So he likes to tie her up, spank her and have his way with her. He never tortured her or peed on her or anything like that. In fact he told her he'd never really hurt her, never break or damage the skin. She had safe words to yell at any time. Did she use the safe words? No. So I guess I can't really wrap my head around him being a bad guy. He worked so hard to earn her trust. He asked her if she trusted him every single time before he would tie her. She said yes every time.<br /><br />Honestly, it's been a couple days since I finished this book, and even though I've started a different book (I'll read the 2nd book of the trilogy next week), I still can't get Christian out of my head. This book was super hot and his commands to her are like Whoa! Biting her bottom lip really got some delicious sayings out of him. I was turning pages so fast, wondering what he was going to do to her next. There is sex on almost every page, and it can be easy to focus just on that, but I do realize there is a bigger story here. The shift in power between both of them was awesome to witness, watching a powerful man crumble to her feet in order to keep her. He'd do anything to make her happy. It's hard to see through his dominating ways, but he's smitten, for sure! Totally unexpected.<br /><br />Now on to what I didn't like....Ana. Ugh, she was annoying to me. As I talked about above, she never left after all the things he warned her about in the first place. She was a stupid girl if she didn't want this. When he was there, she was in love, but if he left for work, she would cry her eyes out and hate him. He's a CEO of a huge company...I'm sure he has to work once in a while. Her inner dialogue was ridiculous. The questions she asked herself. For example, Christian could tell her he absolutely adores her, kisses her passionately and has to leave for the day. Five minutes later, she's sure he does not like her one bit. This goes back and forth the entire book. She also did some childish things along the way. And what she did the morning at the end of the book more than pissed me off. Stupid girl! She acts like she's a young teen! She asked for it. Hello safe words!!!<br /><br />But you know, Christian more than made up for all the parts that Ana pissed me off about, so the book definitely got 5 stars for me. I look forward to 2nd and 3rd books, and what else E.L. James has in the future. No, I didn't mind the repeated phrases that many people complained about.<br /><br />How do I differ from Ana? Call me demented, sick, twisted or whatever you want, I would have already been digging in my purse for a pen before reading the contract and sprint for the playroom. Christian can do with me what he wants...whew! Once again, I'm frustrated that a fictional man is not really real. Is it hot in here?er if she trusted him every single time before he would tie her.

B004SKHJF2|5.0|are no longer a problem with this app.  I love shazam.  works like a charm.  have yet to find a song it did not recognize.
B006UTJ6DM|3.0|As a huge fan of the soundtrack to 'Titanic', I was excited when I saw that this soundtrack had been released. At last, here was an opportunity for the powers that be to fix the two major problems with the original releases - all the missing recordings, and those silly dialogue insertions into their recordings of \\"An Irish Party in Third Class\\" and \\"Come Josephine In My Flying Machine\\". However, caution prevailed - I resolved to borrow this soundtrack from a friend before buying it. I am so glad that I did. To my frustration, I found that, while some additional tracks from the excellent 'I Salonisti' and other groups had been included, apparently no one had the common sense to remove the movie dialogue from any of the songs featured. Why would anyone want to pay extra money to get the same music they bought before, still flawed with \\"Look, Jack, there's a boat!\\" and other nonsense? To my mind that detracts seriously from one's ability to appreciate and listen to the music. Shame on you, Sony Masterworks!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|i just got a sample, but this is the best book ever. i love history and if you do too, itll be perfect
1594744769|4.0|The first thing that struck me about Miss Peregrine was the almost four-dozen pictures that have been seamlessly distributed throughout the story. Ransom Riggs has done more than wrapped his story around random images - the images are part of the story, a vital component in its telling. Without them, the story would be compelling, even good, but would feel a bit flat.<br /><br />The second thing that struck me was the characterizations. Not just the main characters, but the secondary ones feel as if they are people you could know, or have known. It would be very easy to make them stereotypes as told from a sixteen-year-old boy's perspective, but Riggs takes the time to breathe life into them, and in doing so gives Jacob (the main character) more credibility.<br /><br />There are many layers to this story. For pure entertainment, it's thrilling and funny with a quick pace that will keep you turning the pages. If you want to look beyond that, you'll find questions and ideas presented that make you think long after you've set the book aside.<br /><br />I quite enjoy the way Riggs wraps up the story while leaving it open-ended. He brings the story to a close, but gives himself room to write the next part. The reader doesn't feel cheated, and he can continue the story if there is more story to tell.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is... There are certain points where the storytelling feels rushed. I don't mean the moments of tension or the speed of the action. I mean certain things, important points, feel like they were skimmed over, almost as if he was just trying to get to the next part. It only happens a few times (that I noticed) and it doesn't take you out of the story so much as make specific things feel a bit empty.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. The idea of weaving pictures into storytelling intrigues me, and the thought of finding pictures as unique and astounding as the ones used in this story make me want to trek to my local antiques store. Riggshas done something brilliant here, and I look forward to seeing more from him.

0316044695|3.0|The telling of this incredible story of heroism is flawed by the author's need to push his own agenda.  The author spends a great deal of time discussing who's to blame for limiting the effectiveness of our troops and why rules of engagement should really not apply in this case.  I wanted to get a clear, unbiased account of what happened in Operation Redwing. But the author's stated contempt for anything liberal was very difficult to get through.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't get it. As others have said, poorly written, lame characters and inaccurate BDSM. I think its popularity is simply its ability to be read discreetly by bored housewives or women who don't want to be seen with a Danielle Steele novel on the train....and all the TV hype by lame shows like GMA and The View.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|this game is basicly a puzzle where you have to fit all the items into the bag without breaking nything by placing something heavy on top.  It starts out very easy but does progressively get harder.  Not my favorite game but it tuns well on my Kindle fire and is fun and easy to learn.
0345803485|1.0|I know that the author is from the UK, but she could have done a bit of research about America since she chose Seattle as her setting. This is an actual quote from the book:<br /><br />Ana,\\" he smiles his dazzling toothy all-Hispanic-American smile.<br /><br />So, yea....wow. Amazing stuff.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is fun and challenging.  It requires strategy.  It is untimed (which I like).  It runs well on my Kindle fire.  I got it for free but I would be willing to pay .99 on it.
0545265355|5.0|Physically the books are great. Hardcover and well put together, and also at a great price. Nice solid hardcover that protects the books from being bent. Also the little box they come in is nice. Nothing special but it does the job of keeping the books together, I'm not sure what else people might want from a box. Getting all three books together was great I was able to easily go from book 1 - 3 without stopping. I finished book 2 put in back in the box and pulled out book 3 and started reading.<br /><br />The story was also great. If you've seen the movie there are a lot of similarities but there are also a lot of difference and a lot more detail that helps you understand the significance of what is going on. Book 1 was probably the hardest to put down. Very few books can get me from page 1 and not let go. Book 2 and 3 where also fun reads but they started off a little slower. While I was reading book  2 the first half was very tense but I couldn't see how it would be dragged out for 300+ pages, however once it is revealed man I devoured the rest of the book. Book 3 also started off similarly slow. Probably because it seems like the first half of the book is about her mental state and the decisions she has to make. The ending is sad and happy I wish I could change parts of it but I understand that although a happily ever after ending would make me feel better it wouldn't be realistic.  I hope that makes sense I'm trying to be vague so I don't give away to much.<br /><br />Over all<br />Get the books great reads I read through all 3 books in 10 days and if not for other responsibilities would have been finished much much faster.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|this app looks very nice on my kindle fire but doesn't work as well as other apps that are free.  Not worth the .99 when you can find the same or better for free.  Save your money

B0052VUNHC|5.0|First time read review:<br /><br />Absolutely amazing!! I can't explain it. I loved it and will definitely read it again and again. Afterwards I couldn't get it off my mind.<br /><br />This is the review from the other edition and second time I read this book. Only 2 weeks after reading it for the first time!<br /><br />((((This is the second time I have read this book, and in a month too. I really like this book and I don't know what it is about it that I like. It catches my attention and I can't get it off my mind for no obvious reason. All of a sudden a couple days ago I started thinking about it and was just like I HAVE to read this book again. So I did, it didn't seem as long as the first time I read it, probably because I knew what would happen, but it was just as good. I love it and it is one of the top 3 out of the hundreds of books I have read. It has a fair amount of more the more sexual scenes and should only be read by older teens or adults. Lots of people specifically like these kinds of books or don't, I have no opinion and that isn't what I like about it. It seems very realistic but also at the same time unrealistic. Probably because they fight and have flaws just like normal people, but the love seems a little fantasized almost at the same time, the kind of thing that is only dreamed of, or only a few people experience. I'm very glad they worked everything out and am fairly certain they always will, but also with fights of epic proportions throughout their lives. Normally I wouldn't approve of the ending, especially in real life, but for them it didn't seem irresponsible or crazy, it seemed right and I felt it will definitely make each of them feel safer in the relationship and they should be/will be happy. I kinda agreed with Kara about the crazy and co-dependency thing. It almost doesn't make sense how quickly Travis went from being willing to watch her date someone else to never letting her out of his sight. It almost felt like he lost, and I guess he really did, his indifference and confidence, and a little masculinity when he became so dependent. Afterwards he seemed pretty sappy, but happy, as well as almost needy. But then I guess his fights and protectiveness brought out that masculinity again, that bad boy we all fall in love with. So that little part I did not really like, that tone change from before and after they got together, of them being independent and friends to unable to be apart, which is kinda sweet and I do logically understand Travis's point of view when he explains in his speech after the bike ride. But that is one of the parts that borders be unrealistic, a stupid or silly thought or action on their part, but it is also sweet and endearing to me at the same time. Towards the end or when he protects her that strength and confident feeling of the book comes back, so I guess that feeling I don't like is only there when they are fighting. Otherwise the love is awwwwwe inducing. And that is waaaay too much talk about such a small part I don't like because this book truly is to me epic and amazig. I love it, flaws and all because that is what makes it so relatable, realistic and makes me love it. Travis and Abby's story is one I truly enjoyed and can't stop ranting about, obviously, and will always love, read again and again and I will buy a copy for myself as soon as possible. People who should read this: Everyone who loves epic love stories, but it is not just a sappy love story, Older Teens because of sexual content.<br /><br />PS.<br /><br />Unlike some people I actually like the mouth cover just as much or even more than the butterfly one, because although somewhat creepy? or weird? it seems to fit better than the butterfly one which has no relevance in my opinion whatsoever.<br /><br />PPS. I also love the title, because they really are a BEAUTIFUL DISASTER (read that as what the words mean, not just as the title) )))))))<br /><br />PPS. 2 months later and guess what I want to do again!!! :) Read this darn epic book. :D It's crazy.!<br /><br />Another Review on a Blog<br /><br />I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! It is my favourite all time, best I've ever read, I read it about 4 months ago and 2 weeks later again and it is still my favourite. and I've read exactly 150 since then. It was sooooooooo sad for Travis, when he was on the ground... I loved the conversation they had when they initially got together, it was seriously awesome. I also Loved America and Shep, felt bad for him when he was convinced everything was going to go horribly wrong but it was also funny. And I also felt sad for Travis when he had to watch her with Parker. I love how she was all mature about the groupies thing, but Travis's jealous moments were adorable, touching and sexy. It was great how she had no clue what was happening when everyone else and their mother did.<br /><br />I am seriously considering reading it again any day now, as soon as I have time because I'll be checked out for a couple hours. Even so, I run through scenes in my head, I know whole paragraphs. I loved how he respected her and it was so obvious he was in love with her but didn't realize what the heck was going on because he'd never felt LOVE for someone, it wasn't just attraction, but respect and caring too. Although her intentions are honourable, we all know what is really happening in that section I know u know where I'm talking about when I almost want to throttle her but instead settle for sitting here going NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO and bawling,(make that the 2 times, first event and ALMOST reconsideration!! GRRR.) Literally. Because we can deduce why he says what he does when she should just spit out what she was going to say, seriously end a lot of their pain and suffering as well as ours. But TRAVIS IS AMAZING, I agree he was so vulnerable but only with her, totally swoon inducing, not just worthy. There is a big shift from the cocky, bad boy in the beginning to the one in love with Abby, she does that,and he's still there, the guy we love, we just create and enjoy a new side of him. This book was perfect and seriously<br /><br />NOW I HAVE TO READ IT. and I will be up until 4 in the morning tonight to finish it. WORTH IT!!!

0553386794|2.0|I am going to start off this review with saying that the author, almost, did everything right with this book. The characters are awesome and you feel like you know them, the plot is equally as spectacular, and the writing overall is simply addictive.<br /><br />But with all that said, there is one fatal flaw with this book that made me stop reading it. This novel has an extreme amount of sex. The sexual references are bad enough with multiple instances on every page, not to mention the graphic, highly detailed accounts of sex and rape. The author's description is ridiculously noted and disgusting. I could not in good conscious finish this book, which is a crying shame.

B004LWZW8I|2.0|SPOILERS!<br /><br />\\"Immortals\\" is a rivetingly original tale, told in the grand tradition of sword & sorcery fantasy fiction. It is the story of Dar (Henry Cavill), a young fearless warrior who is the last of the peaceful agrarian Emurites. Dar's entire village gets slaughtered by the barbarian Juns in an horrific raid, and Dar is enslaved. One of his fellow captive-slaves is the young and beautiful Kiri (Frieda Pinto), a slave-girl who was secretly an oracular priestess of the old religion, before the evil Juns conquered her homeland and instituted the foul rites of the Priests of Ar.<br /><br />Under the command of their fearsome Warlord (Mickey Rourke), the Jun horde has been raiding religious shrines throughout the known world, in search of the powerful One Ring. The Jun Warlord knows that the legendary One Ring will bestow omnipotence on the Juns and enable him to overthrow the reign of gods by releasing the Kraken, the last and mightiest of the evil Titans, which has been imprisoned by the father of the gods, Zeus (Luke Evans), in a weird cube-thing beneath Mount Tartarus.<br /><br />In the meantime, Zeus and his subordinate gods have been unable to check the Juns' violent incursions, as Zeus proscribes any god's direct influence of mortal affairs, as well as the wearing of anything other than Gay Pride Parade gold flowing capes and headdresses created by Lady Gaga's costume designer. While the Juns' depredations continue unabated, the people of Rohan must flee to the safety of Helm's Deep, their ancestral stronghold. However, the traitor Grima Wormtongue (Joseph Morgan) betrays his former comrades, by revealing to the Juns the one weak point in the walls of Helm's Deep (Hint: It's the gate). The gate of Helm's Deep is known as the \\"Hot Gates.\\" It opens on a narrow corridor that runs for an hundred feet underneath Helm's Deep's defensive wall before debouching into the courtyard of the walled fortress. There in that narrow corridor, the Juns' vast numbers count for nothing, and in this way King Leonidas (Cavill) is able to lead his fellow Greeks to victory, but only after delivering a rousing speech about fighting and why it's necessary.<br /><br />What about the fights? Aren't they amazing? Sure, Henry Cavill fights just about everybody from Nathan Jones' family, and later the Greek gods use their Greek Matrix-powers to battle the Titans, and its all very bloody and gory. Personally, these days I'm feeling just a little more intimidated by short, wiry Indonesian pencak silat masters than I am by seven-foot tall powerlifters. Not only is the fighting much better, but the storyline, plot twists, and character development offered by the short, wiry Indonesians beats \\"Immortals\\" hands down, in my opinion.<br /><br />Oh, and I apologise in advance for destroying any sense of surprise that moviegoers may have derived from viewing this highly original and unique adventure film. Gotta go now, I've got a date in a Jakarta slum with an army of hardcore gangsters. So keep Greeking it up, people. As long as you keep going to see `em, they'll keep making `em.
B002BJGYTY|1.0|The show started out a little cute . . . a little annoying . . . . But by this season it totally gave into the dark side. It became another liberal propaganda show. There were lines about \\"dictators who own ranches in Texas\\" . . . . There were lines about how great and fabulous Hillary Clinton is . . . what a \\"role model\\" she is. There were episodes about how \\"silly\\" mothers of teenagers are who have an issue with LauraLai talking about her pregnancy to them in a school class speech. There is the entire kids sleeping and having their \\"firsts\\", done with casualty. There were episodes where LauraLai says \\"OK Now I believe everything Bush thinks.\\" And of course the stream of guys floating in and out of these two women's lives and beds gets faster. It was just the decline of a show that was pretty entertaining to begin with.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|Thought the subject matter and theme of book to be very interesting. The first quarter of book and last quarter were acceptable but the middle half was less than readable. I also found the amount of profanity in the book to be totally unacceptable and did absolutely nothing to enhance the story. I will not recommend this book to any friend.
B002BJGYUS|4.0|Laugh out loud funny in many places. The wise cracking Laura Lai (or however you spell her name) is hilarious in places. The witty bantering between her and Rory (if that is how you spell her name) is refreshing TV. BUT in between these high points you get a true glimpse of spoiled, self-involved, bratty Americans. Their wise cracks turn into cynicism after they make fun of anything nice and good. The entire \\"I was abused because I was born into a wealthy privileged family with parents who wanted something for me\\" bit got old and actually never got off the ground. It was more like \\"I was abused by my bad decisions born out of total selfish behavior\\" bit. I would have loved to have had had a foot in the door of LauraLai's parents' world. . . . her parents as a great aunt and uncle or something. The show pulls you in to the love stories only to let you down as the \\"heroines\\" turn on their lovers and of course blame their wealthy backgrounds. They toss aside good guys who treat them well just because. They rattle off these lines of just words as fast as they can, usually yelling, gets old and annoying after a while. It is supposed to be intelligent banter somehow, we are led to believe. It was really a disappointment to watch these train wrecks in motion. But I must say . . . it is reality for some people. How many times have you known someone who just dug their own grave out of total immaturity and you just had to sit around watching them to because they refused to listen to any advice. They had everything and just thumbed their nose at it claiming to have the high moral ground. I just think I wouldn't like most of these people in real life as the ones similar to them I know in real life . . . I distance myself from. Funny irony is no matter how much LaurLai makes fun of her parents and her upbringing and no matter how many teary emotional outburts we witness between her and her parents over how \\"abused\\" she was she runs right back to them for help when the going gets rough. I have known a couple of people like that too--they have the luxury of being smarties and mocking the rich as they are rich themselves.rough. I have known a couple of people like that too--they have the luxury of being smarties and mocking the rich as they are rich themselves.

0345803485|1.0|Nothing to say that hasn't been said. This book sucks! Don't buy it. It is much like Twilight but with a skewed version of the bdsm community. Terrible terrible terrible! The reader of the audible one did a good job reading it though.
0812550706|5.0|Let me write what many may not want to: you have to be smart to like this book. Or, perhaps a better way to say this: you must have passions within you borne of empathy, or creativity, or intelligence, or something else--that are so strong that you understand the pain and fear of Ender's success, and the tears he tries to hide.<br /><br />We are a strange race that we place so much power in \\"normal\\" that we make being extraordinary painful. Ender lived that pain every day when wearing the monitor, every day at school, and every day training for that final battle.<br /><br />We know that authors of science fiction create extreme new worlds to test and explore some basic human condition. I believe that the unavoidable battle with the buggers is in a similar way not just a necessary climax to the story, but a device that creates a necessary sense of inevitability for both Ender and reader.<br /><br />Try as Ender may, there is really no escape for him.  And while I do not live in the extreme setting of the Battle School, I have the privilege of knowing many exceptional and profoundly intelligent kids and teens, and for them every day has this inevitable sense of struggle.  Every day is a battle through which they try new strategies and tactics in a never ending attempt to be accepted by a world that rejects their brilliance. Ender's Game is in some ways their personal anthem.<br /><br />I believe people are called to this book because it reflects their own every-day struggle, or at least calls to a part of them that still lives, a passion or a capacity that defines them. And in this very non-fictional world we live in we do not have the buggers to force the issue. We just have us.<br /><br />This book calls not only to what makes us human, but to those passions and capacities which are so strong they scare us. The things that define each of us--fully released--are so strong that we find very few others who really understand. Our choice? To either embrace what defines us and then feel apart from others, or to reject what defines us and feel apart from our own self.<br /><br />On a related note, it is sad to see an author who understands the human condition so well, to--in his later years--become a person unwilling to accept that we are all part of humanity. I find his more recent comments about marriage and sexuality to be truly confounding. Card weaves a thread through much of his writing that clearly says that if someone or something is fully and completely understood, then love is the only possible and the natural result.<br /><br />So, at the moment I tell myself that fame is messing with Card's mind, or that others have successfully laid such a seductive trap that he has lent his name to ideologues who subvert what Card knows, or at least knew about humanity: we are a complex balance of self and group; that finding ourselves is nothing short of walking a tight rope dividing the expression of all of our abilities on one side, from that which acceptance requires on the other.<br /><br />We succeed as individuals if we do not hide what we can do, and we succeed as a race only if we embrace all of the differences each of us dares to contribute.<br /><br />Without that, there would not have been an Ender, humanity may not have survived, nor would Ender have grown into who he became as Speaker for the Dead.<br /><br />That's my two cents. Enjoy the book!

0399159029|4.0|Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi leader of Bohemia and Moravia, formerly known as Czechoslovakia, invites Berlin Detective Bernie Gunter to his castle outside Prague to find out who has been trying to poison him. Assuming the worst, if for no other reason that Gunter has been able to hold on to his position as a homicide investigator in a land where the political rulers are the principal murderers Gunter arrives in Prague in the company of a beautiful hat check girl from a Berlin nightclub.<br /><br />Once at the castle, Gunter is soon confronted by the murder of Heydrich's fourth adjutant, a young SS officer from Heydrich's hometown. The murder occurs in a locked room (with appropriate homages to Agatha Christy along the way), and the list of suspects includes some of the biggest names in the Nazi party. Gunter is given free rein to investigate and along the way manages to insult some of the biggest creeps in a party of creeps, thugs and serial killers. It is great fun.<br /><br />In every good mystery however, things are never quite what they seen and the subplot, the pursuit of Czech terrorists begins to take a life of its own. This work however must be taken in its larger context: how can the rule of law be enforced in such a world? Indeed, how can any moral individual survive?<br /><br />These are the great questions that arise within the pages of Prague Spring. There is no clear answer to them, and that is how it should be.
B00413QB5A|2.0|I have read (and enjoyed) every Ken Follett book available to date, and this is the only one that has truly dissappointed me. I couldn't care less about the characters or the plot, and I found the book actually boring.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|In my opinion all who work in product marketing or product management should read this book. While you reading you sometimes ask your self what is out of the ordinary with this guy? However, you might find some answers and you might find some of the attitude it takes to make great products. However, the book is not single sided. It contains also a side you don't know and mistakes to think about. That would be the optimum result anyway - think about!
0439023521|4.0|I'm pretty late to the party with this one. In fact, I'd had no plans to read it at all, because I don't particularly care for young adult literature. I'm an adult, and I prefer to read books that are targeted toward me. But I saw this on sale cheap, so I picked it up.<br /><br />I thought the author's writing made everything extremely vivid. I had a good mental image of District 12, and Katniss's family. I cared about her, and her friends, right away. I did find the tense a little bit distracting, though. The present tense can be very powerful when done right, but the only instance I've ever seen in which it strengthened the novel rather than distracted from it would be The Handmaid's Tale. In this case, I really think it was a mistake to not write this book in past tense.<br /><br />I liked Katniss. She's clever, but still has some of a sixteen-year-old's emotional naivete. She has a temper, and I like that because it's something I completely relate to myself. I liked Peeta instantly. I kept wanting to hear more from him. I felt she was deluding herself all along that he was trying to manipulate her when it was incredibly obvious he was exactly what he appeared to be: a very nice boy. But given the situation they were in, her misgivings were completely understandable.<br /><br />I raced through the entire second half of this book with a sense of dread, sure that I would find the ending upsetting but unable to stop myself, because I CARED about these characters. I did predict a plot twist that happened very near the end, because I realized that plot twist was necessary in order for it to be a decent story. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't go into further detail on it. Although I was able to predict it, I would have been disappointed in the book if it hadn't done it. The conflict it added was necessary, and I was glad to see how Katniss was able to overcome it.<br /><br />I'll definitely be picking up the next book as soon as I can. I have to find out whathappens next.

B00723NWJE|5.0|This album sounds like it was written on the open road, in an old Cadillac that just manages to make it wherever its taken. Perhaps that is why I like it. It's the first full album by Norah that I've listening to more than once. Her music has always been very pretty, but it never really spoke to me. Little Broken Hearts is a good title, as it probably describes the feelings that the traditional fans will have toward such a change in her style. I'm glad she's breaking from tradition and expanding her sound. She'll gain a new audience that will inject some young blood into her future material.

0345803485|1.0|This was probably the most miserable book I have ever read.  In fact, after the first couple of chapters, I skipped ahead to the end pages to see if it had anything redeeming about it, and IT DIDN'T!  I then tossed it in the trash!  I'm sorry I spent the $10 on it.  Oh, and I had to give it 1 star as Amazon requires that.  If there were such a thing as MINUS stars, I would have given it several.
0345803493|2.0|I thought the first book was interesting enough to read the second but the things that annoyed me in the first book were worse in the second. The main female character bores me. She keeps saying that she doesn't understand what Christian sees in her and I agree. Whenever Christian gasps at one of her witty remarks, I am left wondering what was so witty about the remark. Her personality and dialogue are dull. Occasionally, she says the odd word and it reads as jarring and doesn't fit. Avuncular is one word I recall...Who uses that word in conversation? Really...<br /><br /> Also, the \\"inner goddess\\" \\"subconscious\\" characters were awkward and a bit like the jar jar binks of Star Wars.<br /><br />The repetition is either worse in the second book or since the plot is less interesting, it is simply more obvious. But if I read one more time about her biting her lip, I was going to scream. The amount of phrases that are repeated to the point of distraction are many. The sex is even repetitive and I found myself skimming it after the first thousand scenes..<br /><br />I know it's a love story but for someone to be a sexual deviant but then they meet someone and fall in love and suddenly they don't have that need, it strikes me as ridiculous. Perhaps in the third book that comes back up but I can't be bothered to read it.<br /><br />I was not aware that there was a connection with Twilight and that explains a lot.<br /><br />On the good side, the plot was engaging enough that I completed it and I do like Christian and find most of the lesser characters interesting.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter (of Mars) is the first film since Raiders of the Lost Ark that I have seen multiple times in theatres on its first run. I went in cold, reading no reviews, hoping to enjoy a movie made from books I loved when I was young, but had no expectation of falling in love with this film. And yet...I did. I found the story delightfully complex, a rarity in this day when films commonly dumb themselves down. John Carter (of Mars), however, assumes the viewer has thoughts and feelings and challenges you do engage them both. The performances are excellent, the special effects seamless and believable -- you WILL believe that you are on Barsoom. And I defy anyone with a heart to watch the love story at this film's core without tearing up, more than once. A fine film for ages 10 and up, I should say, a film for anyone with a heart and a brain.
1582701709|5.0|i love this book.  It is my favorite book of all time and I use it as a resource when ever I feel stuck on a thought or worry.<br /><br />I have bought this book for close friends and I think anyone who reads this book can find something  they can use in their own life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to make their life better by focusing on the positive and bringing more good stuff in their lives.
B004ECJNT4|5.0|Review is for the region B Blu-Ray. The movie is great, the transfer is OK, a little better than DVD quality. The sound is good but THERE ARE NO CAPTIONS. I am still happy I have it.
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this movie a 1, but only because I couldn't give it a 0.<br /><br />The plot is so slow and boring that I had to fast forward over 95% of it at 4X speed to keep from falling asleep.  And even at that I couldn't take it anymore about halfway through and ejected the DVD so I could watch a rerun of Gunsmoke.<br /><br />Gina is hot, but her fight scenes mainly consist of her getting jumped from behind and getting beat up.  She ultimately prevails with some ground submission thing out of Gracie jujitsu which is inconsistent with the rest of the fight.<br /><br />The other action scenes mainly consist of her running away from someone.<br /><br />I don't know if the second half of the movie is any better, but I didn't want to fast forward through it long enough to find out.
B000EWBKM6|3.0|No need to buy this and Season 8 disc set(unless there are additional features on this product you care to own).
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's movie \\"Seven Samurai\\" has been hailed by movie critics as one of the best films ever made.  It is a masterpiece not only for its cinematography and filming but it has a story and theme that is enduring.  It was later \\"re-made\\" into the classic western movie- \\"The Magnificient Seven\\".<br /><br />\\"Seven Samurai\\" is one (if not the first) film to have a group or team of men to protect a village or town.  Usually, a single hero would perform this task.  Each of the samurais had unique personas and demeanors- as a whole, they are able to work and move as one.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Criterion Collection of this movie.  It costs a bit more but it is worth it because of the film quality.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B007AJFSJW|4.0|End This Depression Now! By Paul Krugman<br /><br />\\"End This Depression Now!\\" is the plea that makes the persuasive case that we indeed have the knowledge and tools to get out this depression. Nobel prize-winning economist and best-selling author Paul Krugman provides his usual intellectual clarity and sound suggestions on how best to end this economic depression. This is a proactive book, the author lays out what needs to be done and how it can be done while acknowledging the opposition to his arguments. This is a very good and sound book, I have some minor reservations but an overall enlightening read. This 272-page book is composed of the following thirteen chapters: 1. How Bad Things Are, 2. Depression Economics, 3. The Minsky Moment, 4. Bankers Gone Wild, 5. The Second Gilded Age, 6. Dark Age Economics, 7. Anatomy of an Inadequate Response, 8. But What about the Deficit? 9. Inflation: The Phantom Menace, 10. Eurodammerung, 11. Austerians, 12. What It Will Take, and 13. End This Depression!<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Paul Krugman's great reputation precedes him, he writes consistently sound, accessible books.<br />2. A master of his topic and a proven educator. Krugman has the knowledge and the innate ability to make complex economic topics accessible to the masses.<br />3. A self-proclaimed sorta-kinda New Keynesian who when in doubt turns to his Old Keynesian ways.<br />4. Does a good job of explaining the basic principles of Keyne's central dictum: \\"The boom, not the slump, is the time for austerity.\\"<br />5. The author takes a very clear approach for this book. He provides a basic foundation for economics. He proceeds to explain what led us into the most current recession now upgraded to depression and what can be done now to get out of it.<br />6. The important role of the Government in economics.<br />7. A unique and enlightening view on what debt truly is. The \\"paradox of thrift\\".<br />8. How wrong was Greenspan? Find out.<br />9. Krugman dissects the 2008 crisis.<br />10. The big lie about the American crisis.<br />11. The significance of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.<br />12. An interesting look at areas where deregulation worked and where it clearly didn't work.<br />13. The 1 percent, the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent. The rise of inequality. The biggest contribution from it.<br />14. Corruption...a new softer variety but even more devastating.<br />15. The difference between freshwater and saltwater economists.<br />16. The housing bubble and its impact and what can be done to address it.<br />17. A historical look at economics and how lessons learned can be applied today.<br />18. Many economic misconceptions put to the scrutiny: deficit, debt, inflation...to name a few.<br />19. The impact of spending. Interesting.<br />20. Inflation fear mongering.<br />21. Many case studies that help support Krugman's arguments. The euro situation is quite enlightening. As an example, the advantages of having your own currency.<br />22. Europe's big delusion.<br />23. The confidence fairy. The Austerian fallacy.<br />24. Specific ways to address our economic issues now.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. No notes or any formal bibliography.<br />2. Economics is a vastly more complex topic than people realize. There are certain aspects of economics that can never be truly mastered and that's how I feel about this book. I understand clearly the main thesis but I can't seem to wrap my arms over the details.<br />3. As stated before economics is very complex topic, one variable that was barely mentioned in this book is the scarcity of natural resources.<br />4. Lacking enough effective charts to compliment the narrative. There are some charts but I felt that they lacked clarity.<br />5. I'm still having a tough time understanding how inflation helps our economy...understand up to a limit but once again a tough concept to comprehend.<br /><br />In summary, this is a very sound and thought-provoking book. Paul Krugmanis a well-respected and accomplished economist whose accessible writing is a treat to read. Economics is a very complex topic, there are many variables at play and Krugman simplifies matters for the masses all that being said I do have some minor reservations. Some topics seem to elude me...creating inflation to help or control our economy is one of those variables. I also think that the author could have done a better job of summarizing those policies that work versus those that don't. Be that as it may, I enjoyed the book and hold Krugman to high esteem.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I shouldn't ever purchase a book without reading the background information on the author and her inspiration. I had heard about it from all of the obvious sources, and I thought this was a REAL BOOK that went through an agent, on to a publisher, then an editor. It sounded quite cool, like an intriguing work about an alternate lifestyle. But as I read, I couldn't understand how in the world this book was ever picked up by an agent. And I really couldn't figure out what the first manuscript must have looked like if this was an edited work! Well, as it turns out, it went through NONE of those processes.<br /><br />It had no agent, no publisher, no editor. It was published ONLINE first for free. Well, there is a reason it was free, now isn't there?<br /><br />She is a Twilight fan, and that is her inspiration. Inspiration. Hilarious.<br /><br />I'm not trying to be mean to the writer. I'm only trying to give you the information I wish someone had given me. I'm trying to get you to save your money. If you've read a book with a reading level above grade 4, you will hate this piece of garbage. And you will hate yourself for wasting that perfectly good 10 bucks.

Good Morning America must have some financial interest in this book, because I cannot see any other reason to promote it.<br />The story line is shallow, the dialog is basic and without imagination.  It was just enough to tie together the graphic sex talk that seems to be the basis of the book.<br />I really thought it was written by a man, who did not undertand the female mind, and was suprised to find it was not. If it had even been the quality of a Harliquin romance, I would have chalked it up to a bad choice.  It was not even that good.<br />I asked for a refund.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read countless novels of love, love making and romance. I read them wanting more out of the man I was with. Why didn't he think my eyes had stars in them or cloud live months with only the nourishment of my love to feed him? I always fantasized about that perfect man. After ready this book (which I know is fictional) it lets me think of a love that doesn't have to be black or white. It can be what ever it is and it's ok.  The way she expresses her feelings, her internal conflict and how she speaks what's truly the problem is inspiring. This author has taken a dark man and a simple young lady and made their hearts want to be together. I have just purchased the second book and at this point I would read anything this author happened to write.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Any bad reviews are only because the reader does not like tabu sex. This book was amazing. I read it in one day. I am about to read it again until I can get the second part. No erotic novel is a literary genius, if you will. Sex is not suppose to be complicated and erotica is even less complicated. Very sexual and I loved it! Too bad it isnt real!

0345803485|1.0|These books have me rolling my eyes more than Ana.  The trilogy does explore the realm of erotic fiction, but that is all it has to offer.  I don't object to Dom/Sub sexuality, or even exploring a curiosity.  What annoys me about these books is how both main characters admit they barely know each other, and don't fully trust each other, yet profess an undying, all consuming love for one other that I personally find dysfunctional.  If you need to e-mail each other fifteen times a day to keep tabs on one another - that isn't a healthy relationship.  If you get overly jealous when the person you \\"love\\" is only talking to a person of the opposite sex - that isn't a healthy relationship.  The only thing that both these characters have in common is the need to have an over-sexed connection with one another.  If you are interested in learning a few kinky sex games that you would like to try with a partner, these books can offer that.  However, if you read for an interesting story, then take a pass.  Your inner-intellectual will be disappointed.

B004EPYZV2|3.0|I don't watch many movies over a year's time. Two to five rentals tops. I don't watch movies such as \\"Mission: Impossible\\" for a storyline or other such nonsense. I watch a movie to get away from reality for a few hours and just see something that I could never afford to make. I always look for value - and this movie gave me incredible value. I was entertained - period. Multi-$$$ sets, interesting camerawork, a new take on the theme song, take a trip to enemy soil in Dubai (where people hate us and our traditional yankee values - that I'll never give up ), and watch Tom Cruise wrinkle up like a prune as he ages. Definitely worth $1.00 (which came out of my wife's wallet).<br /><br />If I want storyline and reality, I just have to turn off the computer, pack up the DVD, and get on with my life.

0345803507|3.0|After a week and a half of steady reading in between living my life, I finally finished the Fifty Shades trilogy and ran to Amazon to see what the folks are saying.  I won't say that I don't understand the hype - I do.  This was a very interesting story about two people mutually dependent on each other in ways that neither of them totally understood.  I just wish there was a bit more depth here.<br /><br />To start, I really was hooked on book 1.  I'm one of those \\"vanilla\\" type lovers who admittedly has a fascination with the \\"darker\\" side of things.  I was not only curious but enthralled with good girl Ana (who I related to in book 1) meeting the bad boy Christian and her decision over his proposition.  As I read, I wondered what I would do in the same situation.  And that's the mark of a good story - if I can put myself in the pages and live vicariously through the characters, I'm a very happy reader. In fact, I forgave much of the writing style because of this.  Hey, not everyone is Hemingway.  But a good story is a good story and for me book 1 delivered.<br /><br />Book 2 is where things started sliding downward for me.  Things moved WAY too fast in real time, even for a fantasy.  I started to dislike Ana because I just can't respect women who completely change their ways and life for a man.  For instance, she was never a fashionista but just because he gave her those clothes, all of a sudden she's Anna Wintour.  And she was practically obsessed with his moods, his wants, etc.  What about you, Ana?  Also, for a 21 year old, she was unbearably naive.  I understand being conservative when it comes to sex but did she live in the world at all?  And how can any girl be this naive with a friend like Kate?  Made no sense to me.  More so, the dynamic between Christian and Ana was uncomfortable for me.  I like Christian as a character and I felt for him and his pain, but jeez.  They were both unbearable to each other - Ana with her constant questioning and insecurities and Christian with his overbearing insanity.  Regardless, I was still interested in this very symbiotic relationship and I wanted to see where the story was headed.  So I read on to book 3.<br /><br />Book 3 felt like a rehash of the first two.  I found myself skipping through a lot of it because it felt like there was soooo much filler there.  Nothing really happens of significance in book 3, especially since we discovered so much about Christian in book 2, and their relationship really does not grow all that much.  That said, it's worth it to read book 3 just to read (SPOILER!) the birth of their son.  Very touching, at least to me.  But that was it.  It was too convenient an ending for me, even for a fantasy.  And I think Ana annoyed me even more in this book because she was practically Mother Teresa.  It was weird how much everyone loved her, she did no wrong.  All the men wanted her, all the women loved her and respected her.  Especially at work, where she conveniently becomes head editor after hubby buys the company.  Yeah, no one at work has a problem with that?  And she's only 22?  Riiiiight...<br /><br />In short, there's moments of real greatness here and I was hoping that I would continue living vicariously in the pages through book 2 and book 3 but the story started to feel different and I just didn't like were things went. That said, I found myself enjoying parts of it so I do recommend it for a light read.  Three stars.and Christian with his overbearing insanity.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|Thanks HBO for the TV series. Without, I probably never would have bought the books. I've never really been in to 'Middle Earth' type fiction so I had never heard of The Game of Thrones and I was unfamiliar with George R. R. Martin. I've only watched the first season of GoT's on TV so far but it was good enough to entice me into buying the books. There was so much going on in the shows that I thought it would be great to get a better understanding of it all from reading the originals. Much to my surprise, the show - so far - follows the books unbelievably close! I don't remember any TV show or Movie adapted from a novel ever being as true as these are! As soon as I started reading this I realized that even the pilot episode aired it's scenes exactly as Martin wrote each chapter...which was very well done!<br /><br />I won't explain the plot as I'd find it hard to try and sum it up in a brief review anyhow, but I would highly, more highly than any other before, recommend this to anyone who loves reading! You don't have to be a fan of fantasy or medieval literature either. The fact that GoT's is really isn't pertinent to the story. This is by far a more character driven story with many different plot lines and if the author had the time and inclination to do so, could probably dedicate entire novels to each character. There certainly are a lot but each is so well created and woven into this universe. It's easy to empathize with the requisite 'bad guys' when you so clearly can see what drives them, why they are the way they are, and their motives, ambitions, and intentions. Like real life, most characters have both good and bad in them and we get to see all.<br /><br />Many of us have read books that are real page-turners which we've found hard to put down. I know saying so is cliche, but I found this to be the case here as well and I mean so with all sincerity! And being as large as it is...that's been a problem lol! I've had a few to many late, late nights. I've lingered in the bathroom a little to long on a few occasions enough to worry my family, or at the very least to have them pleading with me to get out for their sake. And I've been guilty of the \\"just one more chapter...\\" excuse a few to many times! All this trouble from just 1 book! But it's so worth it!<br /><br />If I had to criticize anything it would probably be that I found there to be way to many characters. Thankfully I bought this on my Kindle and although I already have come to love that and would be hard pressed to ever go back to dead-tree reading, this book would make any reader appreciate one! I nearly wore out my search function looking up characters genesis, and I used the notes and highlight functions more with this story than all others on my Kindle...combined! Please don't let this scare you away though because never have I read a book in which I so thoroughly enjoyed it that I willingly wanted to study and understand all aspects of it. Plus, my memory leaves much to be desired and as I get older I find I need help anymore once I'm required to memorize more than 5-6 characters per book!<br /><br />I'll sum up by saying this; if you've watched GoT's on TV and enjoyed any of it...buy this book! If you're just looking for a good story to read and not sure this is your cup of tea...download the free chapter and go from there! This tome, without exaggeration, may be the best I've read ever and I so thoroughly enjoyed it that I don't hesitate to recommend it whatsoever. And hurry...\\"Winter is Coming\\"! ;)ered in the bathroom a little to long on a few occasions enough to worry my family, or at the very least to have them pleading with me to get out for their sake.

B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Roger Ebert gave this movie three (out of four) stars, primarily because MMA champ Gina Carano appears to use her MMA skills in the fight scenes and because of the film's all-star cast. Note: Ebert did not remark on Carano's acting skills or lack thereof. According to Ebert's users, the movie deserved 2.5 stars.<br /><br />The first person to comment on this movie, in Amazon, gave it 5 stars and said it was non-stop action. Whoever wrote that garbage had to have been high. In the first hour of the movie, there were a total of four fight scenes; all of which totaled about 5 minutes of combined time. One of the fight scenes is only about 20 seconds, which came after a 1-minute chase scene in which Carano's character is running after \\"Bad Guy #1\\" through the streets of Barcelona. The majority of the first hour, you're left watching boring dialogues with very few words. Carano (Mallory Kane) actually does very little speaking the entire film - primarily because she's not an actress; she's an MMA competitor.<br /><br />Ebert was also correct, when he criticized the director of the movie, Steven Soderbergh. This was Soderbergh's first attempt at an action thriller, and hopefully, it will be his last. The script was horrible, the plot was hideously cliche, and even the fight scenes were very obviously and very poorly choreographed. If you're hoping for a \\"Bourne\\" or \\"Salt\\" style action sequence, you won't find it here. In some fight scenes, you can actually watch the actors manipulate each other into the next move... like in one scene, you can picture hearing Carano say \\"Pick your arm up, so I can get you in a sleeper hold.\\" LOL.<br /><br />The funniest aspect of the whole thing was that Carano's character gets punched and kicked in the face multiple times, and at one point, she actually gets a cup of hot coffee thrown in her face, and she never shows even as much as an abrasion. No blood, no bruising... not even some redness or blistering caused by the hot coffee. I foundthis to be pretty hilariously stupid. I don't know how anyone can get punched in the face five or six times and not even show a bruise. This gave the movie a professional wrestling feel... like \\"It's obviously not real, because she doesn't even have a bloody lip.\\"<br /><br />...Not that I expect movies to be real, but I do expect them to be realistic, or as realistic as possible, if they're not animated. Even fist fights in the old TV show \\"Gunsmoke\\" showed people with bloody lips and noses, so it seems pretty lame when a movie is made today, in which nobody ever gets so much as a visible blemish on their face.<br /><br />If you're an MMA fan, or if you're a Carano fan, you will probably love this movie, because it lacks the choreography movie goers enjoy in good Hollywood action movies.<br /><br />But, if you're an action/thriller/espionage fan with a sweet tooth for well-made fight scenes and conspiracy theories, save your money for the next Bourne movie, because everything about this movie blows in every way from start to the bitter end.

B007WULJ5G|5.0|A Serbian Film  tells the terrible story of a retired adult film actor named Milos who gets far more than he bargained for when he accepts what he is led to believe is the role of a lifetime. His intentions are valiant. He needs the money so that he can leave the troubled country of Serbia and start a new life with his attractive and frisky, yet intelligent wife and his young son who looks to have Gypsy heritage and is unbelievably cute. His life isn't as good as it could be. Milos is beginning to struggle with making ends meet, and his brother, who is in law enforcement, hates him because he's attracted to his wife. He accepts the job based on the intriguing premise of what film director Vukmir tells him as well as a former colleague. It's a reality based pornographic art film in which Milos is supposed to instead act off of the reality of the situations he's brought into. He is not supposed to be told about what the script entails. Things begin to get a little too weird when the reality begins to incorporate some sort of strange plot involving children in an orphanage. Disturbed, Milos discusses with his wife what backing out of the film would entail, financially, but eventually even she agrees that it's for the best. He tells Vukmir that he's backing out of the project and has no interest in continuing in filming. Immediately following his declining of the role, however, his life becomes a living nightmare.<br /><br />In terms of the most disturbing films I've seen, A Serbian Film is certainly one of the nastiest. The only films I feel that top it are Come and See(the Russian World War II film about the young boy who goes insane during the 1943 Nazi Germany takeover)and Threads(the BBC mockumentary about Nuclear war). Films that disturbed me similarly would be Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father (the documentary about a child being raised by his father's supposed murderer), Combat Shock (the Troma produced, Buddy Giovinazzo low-budget picture about the deranged Vietnam war veteran), A Clockwork Orange (the 1971 Stanley Kubrick science fiction picture) Possession (the 1981 Andrzej Zulawski horror film with Isabelle Adjani and Sam Neill), Dancer in the Dark (the Lars Von Trier/Bjork musical), The War Zone (the incest themed film that Tim Roth directed), Schindler's List (yes, the Steven Spielberg one, it did deeply disturb me), Chan-Wook Park's Oldboy (the revenge picture) and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (the Tobe Hooper 70s film that needs no introduction). This is a deeply troubling film in many ways and it ultimately left me feeling a great sadness and frustration. There was not a single positive moment in this film that could really make up for the truly ghastly, cruel acts that are committed against Milos and his family. Part of what makes this film so emotional and devastating is the heavy (and I do mean HEAVY) exposition that makes up the entire first hour of the film. We totally see the family that Milos has and we, as the audience, cannot help but admire how far he has come. This is one of the few films I have seen in recent memory that has a heavy plot, yet has a protagonist who takes his wife's feelings 100% seriously and is, all things considered, an ideal husband overall. He and his family may be on the verge of being poverty stricken, but they have as normal a life as a family like that can possibly have. The wife is a non-judgmental, unassuming, mostly pleasant person who is completely faithful to Milos and doesn't fret at the fact that his profession of choice is what he is most known for in other circles. The son is as gentle-natured as a boy like that can be and, aside from viewing one of his father's films in the opening of the film, is totally normal and healthy and is growing up fast.<br /><br />Then there's the brother of Milos, whom we only meet a few times and each time he seems like a mostly sleazy, jealous, and unpleasant man. It's no question that his intentions are impure, and that'sprobably one of the most overtly obvious things about this picture, though it never takes away too much from the gravity of the situations of this film. He is also a police officer, but he seems most distracted by Milos and his wife in particular. He has an unhealthy fascination with his family, and this fact is established early on. At first I was a little put off by his characters antics being one of the key elements early in in the film, but I eventually concluded that it was better for this film to elude to this fact sooner rather than later.. Vukmir seems most suspicious out of everyone, but doesn't seem too obviously crazy, which I suppose may seem jolting for some viewers. He seems more eccentric, but that's true of a lot of filmmakers. I think the fact that this man is eccentric, yet intelligent and thoughtful may be quite scary for many mainstream viewers, who tend to like their villains insane, loud, and obvious. Vukmir may be insane and loud, but obvious would be the last word I would use to describe his overall character. The film takes it's time showing all these characters as fully rounded people who all have their little personality traits and their own agendas. That's why, when things take a turn for the worse, the audience can't help but be jolted and have a strong reaction. Not only do we see these people as genuine characters, but we also jump to our own conclusions about what could happen to them so that we begin to dread when the film turns ugly. Most people who watch this film will likely know about what happens and how notorious the film is for being dark and disturbing. The thing that most people don't know is how, and that's how emotional and devastating the film truly is.<br /><br />Of course anyone could find films that have horrible and horrendous acts in it, but my question would be how hard do those acts affect the viewer? I ask because I highly doubt that the effects are as devastating as the acts depicted in this. To say the least, this is not a film for the faint-hearted, the easily offended, the pregnant, or for people who have heart conditions. This is one of the only horror films in which you nay need to know about the most notorious scene in the film beforehand before watching because once you know the most notorious scene, you may not want to watch it anymore. Without spoiling anything, one thing I will say is that it is not as graphic and explicit as you probably will picture in your mind when you read about it or hear about it, but what makes the scene (and, really, most of the scenes in this entire film) so horrifying are the sound effects and the editing. The actual onscreen content is mostly a lot of smoke and mirrors, and when some explicit and, some would say, pornographic does occur on screen, it's usually too brief for anyone to really fully take in completely. I think this is a good time to say that the most infamous scene in the picture wasn't even the most disturbing part of the film for me. Take that as you will, as a blessing or as a serious warning that you should never even consider watching A Serbian Film.<br /><br />Part of what also makes this film effective has to do with how beautifully made it is. With a film of this nature, which is very politically incorrect, over-the-top, and abrasive in it's depraved imagination, it's highly unorthodox that anyone would ever put in so much money and professional talent, and yet that's what has happened here. The film is remarkably well shot and the editing is as fast and as effective as anything you'd find in a horror film. The soundtrack is chilling, effective, and simple. The film has a very deep, gritty, loud techno score that truly enhances the horror and the circumstances of the characters. These elements wouldn't normally add so much to this film, but the fact of the matter is this. A Serbian Film was independently financed. If this much care and attention to detail can be made to this kind of  film with such a low budget, there really shouldn't be any more excuses, in this day and age, for people to cut so many unnecessary cinematic corners. In terms of acting, the performances are absolutely outstanding. Srdjan Todorovic and Sergej Trifunovic(the actors who played Milos and Vukmir) I learn, are two of the most famous and highly acclaimed Serbian actors of the last decade, and their performances are deeply heartfelt. Again, I find this shocking. The fact that two respected actors would act in a film like this really goes to show you the truly professional approach taken with this material. At the same time, it makes me a little sad. If a popular actor in America chose to be in a film with material like this, their career would likely be ruined. Yet these two men are continuing to get roles and are still acting, and now that this film is getting recognition in the states I'm sure they'll get plenty more. Of course this film is probably likely to be banned in Serbia, as well as in a few other places, so I suppose their acclaim may come at some sort of price. Regardless, as far as Serbian film goes, A Serbian Film is as effective as any other.<br /><br />As a horror film it works wonderfully due to the suspense of the picture. It has a more classical way of plot development and depicting how it all comes together. At times, it feels very modern noir-esque in the same way that the Joseph Gordon Levitt film Brick did. A good chunk of the film is told in hyper real flashback, and so the audience spends a good amount of time wondering what the hell is going on and fearing the worst. Those are the most suspenseful scenes in the film. I like when a film can build so much dread in such a short period of time, and that's one of the things I admired the most about this picture. I like how this film shows events. I like how the film also shows perspective when it comes to what happens. I think one of the more effective parts of this film comes toward the end of the picture when it suddenly dawns on us that this story is not going to have the usual horror film ending. I wouldn't even call this a horror film really if it weren't for the fact that it is scary. It's a horror film in the same way that a film like Brian De Palma's Blow-Out or Sam Raimi's A Simple Plan could be considered horror films even though they certainly aren't. I cannot really complain, however, about whatever elements of genre this film may exhibit, because A Serbian Film breaks more taboos than most films manage to do in the span of two hours, and it does it without sacrificing an ounce of coherency. I'm of the firm belief that all taboos need to be destroyed as soon as possible, and the major one this one breaks is in it's depiction of the adult film industry itself. This film treats the porn film industry incredibly fairly, by depicting it as just another profession just like any other, and by showing the main protagonist, a hardcore porn actor, as being nothing more than just a regular guy who has a normal set of morals and emotions and who happens to just know some very bad people. That's a fact that I feel this film deserves to be recognized for.<br /><br />This film's way of depicting tragedy is really interesting, because it relies more on genuine personal torment and frustration in order to allow the audience to be emotionally involved in the situation that Milos has undergone and is still working through. It's a tricky technique, but somehow it works. It especially works when the film finally makes it's biggest revelation, which is just terrible and deeply heartbreaking, and then the horror doesn't stop there. To quote one early review that I read before I saw the film, \\"penises are inserted into things that they were never meant to ever enter into.\\" It's true. What works the most about all this, however, is how unabashed and how bizarre and off-the-wall the nature of reality becomes as the film progresses. The film isn't afraid to be even the slightest bit surreal, and one thingI love about a lot of art is a healthy dose of surrealism. The film isn't also afraid to be darkly humorous. Without spoiling anything, there is a scene in this film in which a man takes his own dick hostage at knife point. Nobody could ever take a film that contains such a ridiculous idea completely seriously, and so viewers should certainly not be afraid to find this film entertaining. The film is entertaining in the same way that the hammer scene at the end of Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is entertaining. It's perversely entertaining. Director Srdjan Spasojevic creates such a chaotic world that we get involved in, and we, the audience, are led to believe that anything horrible and depraved could happen at any moment and there will be no limits. It's true too, because there aren't any real limits. I mean yes it is horrible, but at the same time the film manages to in fact tell a story and it manages to be scary and effective as a horror film. That's what amazes most about this picture. A Serbian Film is as gory, and disturbing, and as intense as it gets, but none of it ever feels the least bit gratuitous, even if the imagery can be quite jarring and unsettling at times.<br /><br />Part of me also wants to pay more attention to the political aspects of the film, which come across as more metaphorical at times although they are undeniably still there, despite whatever the naysayers say. This film is more a picture dealing with a collective rage that is garnered from the citizens of the country of Serbia that comes from many years of war atrocities, political corruption, dishonesty, and censorship that befallen Serbia in the last two decades. The acts that are depicted in this film, obviously, are nothing compared to the terrible things going on there in war-torn areas, and I highly doubt any comparison was intended. The idea of soldiers being forced to basically become animals in order to serve their government is a lot more disturbing in itself thanwhat's going on in this film. This film's intention is not to show all that and try to compete with ghastly imagery on it's own, but instead to emulate the same feelings of living in a war torn environment in which the local business and people, so devastated by the atrocities, have crumbled. As the director described, he's taken a profession, in this film being the adult film actor, and has found a way to have it so that the character, so to speak, is raped in multiple ways. In this regard, I think the film works wonders, though I would recommend forgetting all of that if you're going to take the film on an emotional level. Essentially it's kind of like what Eli Roth tried to do with Hostel, though with mixed results. There's nothing wrong with making a horror film, and in a lot of ways Hostel is a much more violent film than A Serbian Film. This is not the kind of horror film that is all blood and guts and sex. This is more the kind of horror film that is like Pasolini's Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom, Von Trier's Antichrist, or Lyne's Jacob's Ladder. Essentially it's a horror film that does a lot more than just horrifies. It's a tragedy that you can't help but have a strong reaction to. It's really no different than Chan-Wook Park's Oldboy, which to me is an equally powerful and disturbing film. My reaction to this film is one of tremendous sadness and anger. Anger at the filmmakers for showing me these things that I don't want to see, and sadness for myself for watching this. Wes Craven did the exact same thing with Last House on the Left. His film was his reaction to the Vietnam war. Films like this are simply reactions to the violence and depravity of the world around us and nothing more. It's difficult to put into words how one would feel, for example, if someone opened up a newspaper and read about a girl getting kidnapped, raped, murdered, and dissolved in acid. It's impossible to find the right words to describe how sad one would feel, and there is nothingwrong with making a film that is meant to emulate those feelings for the average viewer. A Serbian Film is primarily, however, an attack on censorship and political correctness. In a time in which many films are banned in different countries for jokes against the handicapped, for racial humor, and for satiric attacks against political figures, one of this film's major intentions is to destroy taboos, which to me is an important thing. Today, Mel Brooks would never be allowed to make Blazing Saddles without controversy blowing up in his face. I think that taboos are holding the human race back, and in a way it is very refreshing to see a film that is so gleeful in it's destruction of forbidden imagery and ideas.<br /><br />The big question for me would be, should I recommend it? On one hand, this film angered me and made me feel terrible for poor Milos and his wife and child and the horrible things that they all go through. On the other hand, this film, in terms of transgressive cinema with pictures such as Ex Drummer, Irreversible, Inside, and Martyrs, A Serbian Film is one of the best of it's kind. It's one of the most effective films I've seen in years as well as one of the scariest. It's disheartening, frustrating, and cruel. One thing I can definitely say though is that it's not gratuitous. Brutal? Definitely. Exploitative and over-the-top? Maybe a little, if you want to get really into it. Horrifying? Yes. It's beautifully made, it's heartbreakingly tragic, it's terribly realistic, it's not entirely humorless (some of the violence seems straight out of a Troma picture), and it's one of the most effective and well made films as well as one of the most disturbing. The big question is, does it work? Yes, it works. It works a little too well one could say, but it works. So do I fault it for working? No, I praise it. I wouldn't recommend to everyone, but I'm glad that films like this can still be made and I'm glad that filmmakers have the guts to go all the way with their vision. Srdjan Spasojevic was clearly inspired by the works of filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Brian De Palma, David Cronenberg, and William Friedkin. This is Srdjan Spasojevic's first film, and I think a lot of Hollywood horror filmmakers could learn a thing or two from his style and his fearless approach to this rather difficult material. It's one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, and I don't regret watching it for even a second. If a film can get to me this strongly, it has certainly done something right.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard about 'The Hunger Games' by pure chance at a choir rehearsal for St Matthew's Passion from a recent university student I had taught...His wonderful voice as he sang St Peter got me thinking.  Suddenly I heard about the novel from another source.  As I teach teenagers and we are reading 'Lord of the Flies' at the moment I needed little encouragement to order the book.  What a read!  Not as bloodthirsty as I had thought - rather the triumph of the strength of the human spirit over insurmountable odds.

B001AQO3XS|1.0|It remains somewhat surprising to me that so many of the DVD/Blu-Ray reviews I find on Amazon are about the movie rather than the quality of the product/medium. One would have expected movie reviews to be found on an entertainment site like IMDB, but here, it would seem more appropriate to describe the manufactured item.<br /><br />That said, I found this Blu-ray disc to be profoundly disappointing. The \\"HD\\" quality of image reproduction vacillates between 2 completely undesirable extremes. The rendering of at least half of the movie is so grainy that to compare it to streaming a youtube video over a dial-up connection would still leave it wanting. At other times, the resolution is so crisp that the scar make-up on the Kurgan looks about as convincing as fake vomit from a strip mall novelty shop.<br /><br />Neither of these options reflects my memory of seeing this movie on a full-sized theatre screen; both become distracting in ways that shocked me out of the story experience and straight to a keyboard to express my disdain.

I will never NOT love them, but I desperately await their true return to dominance.
0439023521|1.0|the book had an interesting protagonist. writing was easy to read. pace was good. a real page-turner. there, I've fulfilled my mom's requirement to not say anything if you can't say anything good. had some issues with the accuracy of some of the survivalist scenes (I've actually spent a lot of time mucking about in the woods), and the artificiality of the pacing (the gamemasters (or whatever they were called) did it for pacing of the TV show), and the arbitrary way the author killed off the REALLY interesting character (the little girl--I think the author realized she was going to be more interesting than the protagonist, and that was her death sentence), and the idea that \\"suicide is the solution\\" which should NEVER be presented to teen, and pre-teen kids, and the overall premise which really manipulates a reader if they have abandonment issues. The overall premise, that were could be a society that sacrifices their young (and sustains that practice for 74 years without widespread popular uprising against it) would be OK if it had a fairy tale ending (abandonment of parental protection is a common fairy tale premise), but the protagonist does not seem safe, even at the end. The premise is inhuman, imo, and just feeds those fear-of-abandonment issues that all children, and many adults have.  I felt the author was trying to psychologically manipulate the reader and feed off their abandonment issues.  I think that is absolutely inappropriate for a book directed at youths, unless there is an ending that provides more resolution.

B0074JODEY|1.0|For die hard fans of the ORIGINAL BOX SET that included the FULL VERSIONS of the first 2 movies \\"Sword of Vengeance\\" and \\"Baby Cart at the River Styx\\", and who have been waiting for the full series in it's original version to come out on Blu-ray, this collector's set is a BIG SAD DISAPPOINTMENT.  I was not a fan of the AnimEigo chop-job of the first two films that was turned into \\"Shogun Assassin\\".  \\"Shogun Assassin\\" destroy's the EPIC FEEL and critical powerful details of the first two films seen in their original full-length glory.  The people at AnimEigo who decided to do this obviously did it to make a quick buck, and did not have the die hard \\"Lone Wolf\\" fans in mind.  That's understandable and for most non-fans \\"Shogun<br />Assassin\\" is a good movie intro into the \\"Lone Wolf\\" world.  However, my point is, if you are going to make what should be a  definitive collectors version on BLU-RAY for the die hard \\"Lone Wolf\\" fans, you shouldn't go cheap and leave out the first two movies by substituting them with a sub-standard edited version that already came out on the market.  If you bought that Blu-ray version, and I did, why would a REAL FAN want a duplicate copy in their \\"Special Event Box-Set\\"?  After waiting for this for years, I feel completely RIPPED OFF!

0316098329|5.0|When I first started reading this book I was unsure if I would be able to endure the story. It is narrated by a five year old boy which lends a certain amount of innocence and makes reading this story more bearable. I have to say I could not put this book down. This first half of the story is gut wrenching while the second half I found to be a relief in some ways. An interesting look at the psychological impact of captivity from the perspective of a five year old.

1878424319|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who told me that it would be a catalyst for change -- and that is exactly what this book accomplished. Essentially, The Four Agreements describes how every human being is saddled with bad \\"agreements\\" or habits that they have made which weigh them down. These agreements are formed within us throughout our lives as a result of our culture, society, and family upbringings. The book then challenges the reader to throw away those agreements and adopt Four new habits which, if practiced, will transcend the reader to new heights. The end goal is to become the person that you were meant to be but couldn't because of those pesky agreements. I won't get into detail of the four agreements because the best part is slowly reading them and realizing the immediate impact they will have on your life.<br /><br />I am not a fan of self help books because the category alone makes it seem like something is wrong with you if you read one of them, but the Four Agreements would probably be categorized as such because of the nature of the story. I felt that I was being challenged with every word written : challenged to make myself complete and whole, challenged to reach my potential, challenged to change for the better. In that way, The Four Agreements never felt like a self help book, it just felt like a book that made connections I had never known and challenged me to become utterly awesome. I will cherish this book and keep it with me, forever pushing myself to hit and surpass my own expectations.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|I like a book that is fast, compelling and with a lot of mystery - this ticks all the right boxes. Archer certainly is a good storyteller and I think this is probably his best. The book opens with Adam reading a letter, which reminded me of another great (and very funny) book I read this year, Tony Royden's dark comedy thriller [[ASIN:B0079LSUIW The Dealer]]. They both start in similar ways, with a letter that triggers off a chain of mysterious events, but they are very different reads - both superb in different ways. A Matter Of Honor is much more of a James Bond type thriller.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. A must read!

B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|There isn't a whole lot of substance to the plot of HAYWIRE: former mercenary Mallory Kane is double-crossed by her employer/boyfriend, and goes about seeking revenge.  Yep, it's that simple.  You've seen/read/heard the story a dozen times before, and that's only if you aren't a fan of the spy genre.  The structure is slightly unique--the story is told in flashbacks, anchored by a \\"present tense\\" scene involving Mallory dictating her story to a reluctant passenger (RED STATE'S Michael Angarano).  But even this nonlinear structure is a bit tired by now, and honestly most of the story could've benefited from a straightforward approach.<br /><br />Why should you watch HAYWIRE then?  Because it's a film by Stephen Soderbergh, a filmmaker so utterly devoted to his craft, he's threatened to retire from it (yeah, one of \\"those\\" auteurs).  Sarcasm aside, Soderbergh knows what he wants, and he almost always delivers.  HAYWIRE isn't intended to be anything original; and it's not.  It's a straight-up action film, full of those twists and fight scenes and menacing baddies that all action films feature, but filtered through Soderbergh's well-honed lens.  The cinematography is perfect; the fight-scenes are flawlessly choreographed, with no weird cuts or music to take away from the brutal punches and shattering glass.  These are real people doing real stunts.  Yep, just like it used to be.<br /><br />Soderbergh's choice of star is well-intentioned and mostly on-cue.  Gina Carano isn't an actress, and it shows; but then, she rarely has to do much acting, and certainly no actor could do her stunts quite like she can.  That's obviously clear in the fight scenes between the likes of Michael Fassbender and Channing Tatum: both actors bring their best (and Tatum's best is surprisingly good), and while they can act circles around Carano any day, they can't hold their own in the ring with her.  Also bearing some of the acting burden are Ewen McGregor (a decent villain), Michael Douglas (barely there but always welcome), Bill Paxton (again, little to do, but he does it well), and Antonio Banderas (who, with the best one-liner in the film, proves he's still a contender, and not just an animated bee or cat).  Ultimately, HAYWIRE will be enjoyed by one of two camps: the Soderbergh fans, and those who like an old-fashioned action/espionage thriller, the kind without computer effects or noisome soundtracks or too many gimmicks.  HAYWIRE isn't a perfect film, and it probably never could have been...but it's a Stephen Soderbergh film, which is definitely saying something.arely there but always welcome), Bill Paxton (again, little to do, but he does it well), and Antonio Banderas (who, with the best one-liner in the film, proves he's still a contender, and not just an animated bee or cat).

B0055SWM08|4.0|Update: In reference to the reviews mentioning facebook and ratings.. the game has NEVER bugged me to rate it or join the developer's facebook page! This must have been fixed with an update and I hope those reviewers update their reviews as well!<br /><br />I like this app. I had gotten it as a free app of the day and I still play it every now and then. I enjoy trying to find the perfect rating on each level. The puzzles have a nice level of challenge; they're never too frustrating to be fun. The music and graphics give it a nice atmosphere as well. It's a great relaxation aid.<br /><br />My only minor issue with the game is that there are a couple of bugs that could be fixed. For one, simply pressing Home or locking the screen will \\"sort of\\" exit the game entirely. Your current level progress will still be intact, but you'll have to watch the opening screen again. Also, sometimes in the middle of playing the screen will flash briefly. I thought this was supposed to be lightning, but it apparently isn't because it also shows the title of the level for a split second.<br />These are pretty minor bugs though. I am mainly including them for the developer's reference. Overall I really like this game and it is certainly worth the price.
0345444051|5.0|Although being relatively new to the world of Arthur C. Clarke, I think that it is safe to say that Childhood's End is an outstanding novel on it's own.  Following several characters over time, this book maps the path taken by the suspicious and seemingly all-powerful \\"Overlords\\".  Through an eerily systematic approach (at times making parallels to American colonization by the Europeans), the native humans become more and more accustomed to their presence in their everyday life.  A twist at the end reveals that the Humans and Overlords alike are part of something much bigger than they ever could imagine.  This novel challenges the human intellect and understanding to its deepest roots, questioning mankind's purpose and pushing the reader into thoughts they may or may not have wanted to delve.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|I strive to purchase only legitimate DVD's.  This one appeared to be so, however, upon viewing, we experienced multiple cases of pixelizing and freeze.  This may not be the proper place to vent this info.  It is just frustrating to expect a state-of-the-art presentation and then have this happen.  Our daughter operates a business in Kauai and was an extra in the movie, but we were not able to see her in our copy of the movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|God, this book was emotionally exhausting to read.<br /><br />I had so many issues with this book, and yet I could not stop reading it. I likened it to a bad car accident on the side of the road that you know you shouldn't look at...but you just can't help yourself. And yet, with all the problems I have with FSOG, I still ended up giving this a 4 1/2 star rating. I know that sounds insane, but i will do my best to explain how I ended up doing so.<br /><br />Let's start off with what I didn't like about the book.<br />First and foremost - Anastasia. In a word, her character was insufferable. I understand that she was intended to be a very wide-eyed, innocent girl who is overwhelmed by both Christian and his lifestyle. But, instead of innocent she came off as just plain childish and bratty. I have a very hard time taking a character seriously who is unable to refer to her own body parts as something other than 'down there.' Also, her mood swings were unbelievable. One minute she is gushing about how much she cares about Christian, and how he makes her feel special, and that his 'kinky ways' were hot...and the next she's whining that he frightens her, he's a stalker and a deviant, and she needs to run to the hills to get away from him.<br /><br />Being that the POV is from Ana's perspective, there is much focus on her struggle to understand why CG wants to \\"hurt\\" her. And while I get that his lifestyle was overwhelming, he did warn her in the beginning that she probably couldn't handle what he wanted from her. And the fact that she continually changed her mind about entering into the Dom/sub relationship, only ended up hurting Christian, and f'ing him up even more than he already was.<br /><br />Other issues that bugged me:<br />* A lot of repetition. Be it the mantra of 'Don't bite your lip.' or Ana's constant 'Oh my'. By the end of the book I had learned to ignore them, but still...it was annoying.<br />* We all know by now that this started out as a Twilight fanfic. Which is fine, but sometimes the similarities were just glaringly obvious (Ana being so clumsy, CG being indescribably beautiful, the Washington/Seattle setting...some of the situations, even some of the dialogue was close to what was said in Twilight)<br /><br />Having said all that...<br /><br />In all my years of being a voracious reader, I can not remember the last time I devoured a book with as much intensity as I did Fifty Shades Of Grey. And then there is the fact that I absolutely adored Christian. As f'ed up as he was...he was still an amazing, and very captivating character.<br /><br />Some readers have claimed that there were far too many sex scenes in this book. My reaction to that is, \\"Are you kidding me?\\" The whole reason most people are reading this book is for the sex, so don't try and get all prudish while reading a book about an admittedly watered down version of a BDSM relationship. :P<br /><br />It might make no sense to anyone else...heck I'm still confused by how much enjoyment i got out of this book, despite the long list of problems I had with it.<br /><br />I guess I can call Fifty Shades of Grey a guilty pleasure. And while I will no doubt be wanting to throttle Ana in the remaining two books, I still plan on diving into them with earnest.Which is fine, but sometimes the similarities were just glaringly obvious (Ana being so clumsy, CG being indescribably beautiful, the Washington/Seattle setting...some of the situations, even some of the dialogue was close to what was said in Twilight)<br /><br />Having said all that...<br /><br />In all my years of being a voracious reader, I can not remember the last time I devoured a book with as much intensity as I did Fifty Shades Of Grey.

B007CKNX28|5.0|Does Jack White ever record a bad album? That is a rhetorical question of course (the answer is no).  White is one of the most talented songwriters, producers and musicians of our time.  His first solo album [[ASIN:B007CKNX28 Blunderbuss]] (no cheap shots at his macro role with The White Stripe of course) is highly representative of his consummate gifts.  White's solo work is not so different a style than say his work with  The White Stripes, though the instrumentation is certainly fuller  - he allows for plenty of help on Third Man released effort (Sony).<br /><br />The album opens with the brilliant \\"Missing Pieces,\\" in which minimalistic Rhodes lines, covered by White himself, set the tone.  A drum groove eventually enters, reminiscing back to 1960's rock and roll.  On \\"Missing Pieces,\\" White allows for plenty of instrumental moments to show off his talents, including both a Rhodes and electric guitar solo.  White doesn't miss a beat on the great followup to \\"Missing Pieces\\" in \\"Sixteen Saltines,\\" which possesses some solid riffs and an addictive grooved buttressed by the drums. The songwriting is noteworthy including notable lines such as \\"I eat sixteen saltine crackers , then I lick my fingers...\\" as well as the quasi-unifying hook \\"who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous. Who's jealous of who?\\"<br /><br />The interesting groove, intact with tambourine of \\"Freedom at 21\\" continues the captivation established by White's cerebral mind.  White aims for a quasi-sung/rap performance, in the idiom of indie-/alternative rock of course. Jack White's attitude here is surprising yet refreshing as he again exhibits top-notch songwriting: \\"Two black gadgets in her hand/that's all she thinks about/no responsibility, no guilt or morals/cloud her judgement, smile on her face/ she does what she damn well please...\\" \\"Love Interruption\\" may be even more creative, if for nothing else than the use of clarinet and bass clarinet, performed by Emily Bowland.  Bowland's role as clarinetist replaces the rule of an electric piano or guitar that might traditionally possess the role.  Background vocalist Ruby Amanfu assists White on this brief, well written cut, in which he supplies acoustic guitar accompaniment sans drums or bass.  I mean who uses clarinet and bass clarinet in rock and roll these days?<br /><br />\\"Blunderbuss\\" is a solid title track, establishing a timbre with pedal steel (Fats Kaplin) as well as acoustic piano, acoustic guitar, and upright bass.  An interesting feature is how the acoustic piano and upright bass play in tandem with one another; great orchestration.  \\"Hypocritical Kiss\\" is even better, one-upping a very well executed title cut.  \\"Hypocritical Kiss\\" features excellent piano playing by Brooke Waggoner, who has considerable skills.  The harmonic progression is sound while unsurprisingly White's production is perfect.  The songwriting of this valedictory cut yields another scathing, aggressive turn from White: \\"...And who the hell's impressed by you? I want names of the people that we know that are falling for this...\\" Jack White's feeling it on this outing.<br /><br />\\"Weep Themselves To Sleep\\" ends up being the longest cut of the album, but still the duration is under four and a half minutes.  \\"I'm Shakin',\\" composed by Randolph Toombs proves to be a more thrilling cut, cultivating a blues-rock sound intact with guitar effects.  The groove contrasts the slower, more dramatic nature of \\"Weep Themselves to Sleep.\\"  Further adding to the greatness is the trio of background vocalists: Ruby Amanfu, Karen Elson, and Laura Matula. \\"Trash Tongue Talker\\" keeps up the momentum with White handling acoustic piano duties on this cut.  The musicianship unquestionable here, another high watermark of this album.<br /><br />\\"Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy\\" is clever with a six-feel and the use of interruptions to the standard groove if not a first-tier cut.  \\"I Guess I Should Go To Sleep\\" is in one metrically, contrasting previous cuts.White again delivers solid songwriting as well as shows off some gifted pianistic skill.  Again flaunting his pianistic skills,  White plays through a Leslie Speaker on \\"On and On and On\\" to give the cut a more unique timbre.  Closing cut \\"Take Me With You When You Go\\" ends the album as exceptionally and strong as it began, with White delivering another capable vocal performance as well as solid guitar chops on his solo.  A change of pace is a contrast just after the 2:00 mark.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B007CKNX28 Blunderbuss]]  makes few missteps if any.  The cuts tend to be short, well executed, and memorable.  White's musicianship and mark shines through all the thirteen tracks.  Even where vocally he may not be the best singer, his style and approach are perfect for this type of album.  Don't be surprised if Blunderbuss is a Grammy darling come 2013.White again delivers solid songwriting as well as shows off some gifted pianistic skill.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Having had a long list of problems with the first book in the series (but still managing to devour the book greedily), I am very happy to say that many of the issues that I had with Fifty Shades of Grey were at least some what rectified in this book. Certain phrases (Don't bite your lip. Oh my... etc) were still present, but not nearly in such a maddeningly repetitive way here. Also, while Ana will never be one of my favorite heroines, her bipolar mood swings were also toned down in book 2.<br /><br />The best aspect of Fifty Shades Darker was that the focus was more on Christian and his past. James delved into some of the reasons why Christian is the way he is. And for someone who made such a mess out of the 'plot' of the first book, she handled CG's problems in a very believable and convincing manner. Her writing definitely improved with this book as well.<br /><br />One of the most compelling and brilliantly done scenes involves Christian falling to his knees in submission to Ana in an attempt to keep her from leaving him. It is a scene that all Grey-sessed fans know quite well, and it is easy to see why it is a favorite among the series.<br /><br />This was by far my favorite book of the trilogy and with the exception of the very last scene (which honestly felt tagged on in order to qualify having a third book), Fifty Shades Darker was about as close to perfect as a dark erotic romance novel can get.
B006CC0YB0|2.0|Usually I resort to Mark Lanegan for a rootsy folk rock with a drunken ragged voice. On Blues Funeral the songs draw long and have very repetitive and cliché lyrics. Sometimes his trademark deep voice just becomes a monotone emotionless growl. The electronic elements that have been premiered here do little to give this album it's lacking dynamism. There are a couple songs on here that I thought were rather good, but overall I was disappointed and bored by this.
B0072440OE|3.0|First, I must say that i love the mood of Norah's new album and i hope she produces more music like this in the future, I can't get enough of it, 5 stars all the way. My problem is with the sound quality of the Vinyl edition.<br /><br />Produced on 2 180 gram white colored vinyl's (which by the way look really cool) and housed in a nice gate-folded cover with a giant sized poster of the album artwork and a MP3 voucher card good for one free download of the entire album included inside, everything a vinyl lover would want, EXCEPT! grade A sound quality. I've played both Records twice and i keep hearing an excessive amount of audio pops, mainly on side 1 of the first record, but pops can be heard throughout the entire album. I don't know, maybe i just got a flawed copy, but i doubt it, This amount of audio pops just shouldn't be present on a new album like this.<br /> Even with it's less than perfect audio quality I would recommend that people by this vinyl, because overall it's still a good looking product and it displays great on my record shelf, and lets not forget that it comes with a free MP3 download which has no audio pop ;)<br />UPDATE: i uploaded some pictures of the vinyl edition for your viewing pleasures.
B006DICWUE|3.0|This album is nada surf retreating to a more guitar driven sound but maintaining the accessible sound that has given them their fair share of popularity. This album has some good and catchy tracks (you'll find yourself singing \\"waiting for something\\" over and over). My biggest gripe with the album are the production aspects, the sounds seem flat and mashed together on the heavier, more fast-paced tracks. the slower tracks are still able to convey a very pleasant experience. Overall a good and decent release, will not disappoint fans but won't win many new ones.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|There's simply no comparison with the build quality of this OEM unit vs. an aftermarket grip. I've previously had aftermarket grips on all my Canon cameras with the thought of, \\"they're all the same why buy OEM it's more expensive?\\" Well, the Meike grip on my 7D went intermittent and I returned it and decided to go with this Canon OEM grip. No creaks, no moans, no rattles. This thing is solid! It shares the magnesium alloy construction of the 7D so it's not plastic like the aftermarket grips, the texture and surface feels just like the camera and to me it's worth the extra money just for the construction of the unit alone.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|That was a joke, of course. Any sane person knows that title belongs to Iron Maiden's \\"Dance of Death\\". That is, unless I'm living in an alternate reality where \\"true metalhead\\" really means \\"Tripp-pants wearing bleach haired Nu-metal bandwagon jumping douchebag\\".<br /><br />Never liked Godsmack back then, even when I was obsessed with System of a Down and what not, and take a wild guess as to whether or not I give a single flying frak about them today. They, along with several other Nu-metal crap bands helped killnthe metal genre in the 2000s, and sadly, the genre never really recovered. The metal bible has a rule specifically stating \\"Thou shalt not listen to trend-hopping bands with down tuned guitars and vocals equivalent of a camel pooping out a chainsaw\\". Sadly, metal's disciples will be burning in metal hell for that, or so it seems.<br /><br />For catharsis, please consult your local Iron Maiden concert, where such slaughter of intelligence is destroyed.
B000002AQQ|5.0|Although my review doesn't cover the two extra tracks put on the 2001 special edition, I think this first release of the Forrest Gump soundtrack is just a marvel to listen to. As the movie for which it was used follows the life of, as stated in the album's leaflet, \\"A simple man's journey through complicated times\\", this soundtrack covers American songs going from the fifties (Hound Dog, Rebel Rouser) till  1980 (On the Road Again, Against the Wind). Therefore, listening to this album is almost like getting to live or relive those time periods, along with the incidents that have had a major impact on our lives and our world. As such, the nostalgia in this soundtrack is as heart-wrenching as the movie it was made for.<br /><br />Though I have loved all of the music tracks, I'd say my favorites are \\"Blowin in the Wind\\", \\"I Can't Help Myself\\", \\"What the World Needs Now is Love\\", \\"Stoned Love\\", \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" and \\"Turn!Turn! Turn!\\". As for the music composed by Alan Silvestri, the producers of this album also offer us the \\"Forrest Gump Suite\\" as a final treat. However I still wish they could have included the song \\"Freebird\\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, which was used for that powerful scene when Jenny (played by Robin Wright) is attempting a suicide by jumping off from a balcony. I always wonder why they didn't get to put that track. Maybe they had contractual reasons, or maybe they didn't had any more space to put the song on the album? Who knows? Then again, I still wish that they could put that song in a future edition.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I think this soundtrack is a must for all the fans of the Forrest Gump movie, but also to anyone fond of American music done in the fifties, sixties, and seventies.
B007JQLNXG|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this product; which is what it is...product.  Peter Gabriel is notorious for not providing product for years at a time but this orchestral foray has yielded 3 CDs and a DVD in the space of two years.  Another reviewer referred to this project as innovative.  While the \\"Scratch My Back\\" project may be considered innovative, with it's deconstructed versions of other people's songs with an invitation to return the favor, the idea of performing one's own hits with a symphony orchestra is hardly original.  That said, I am still looking forward to David St. Hubbins version of \\"Big Bottom\\" with orchestra.<br /><br />This is just the audio only version of the DVD/Blu-ray released earlier in the year so if you bought that do you need this? At least the price is right, $15 bucks for two discs and a very modest booklet.  Some of the performances are powerful and beautiful but, on the whole, these versions of Gabriel's own songs are not as interesting as his covers (of which only four appear here).  I am more looking forward to the response album, if that ever comes together, and perhaps some new music from Gabriel, Levin and Rhodes?  It's been a while.
0553801473|4.0|Like many people I was disappointed by A Feast of Crows.  I thought it was too long and at times boring.  I read reviews of this book that stated this book was no better than A Feast of Crows.  I totally disagree.  This book delivered for me.  Part of it for me is that I believe the more interesting characters were covered in this installment.  However I also believe Martin just did a better job of writing.  Some of the plot developments are to me really intriguing.  There wasn't a great deal of action, but there was plenty of intrigue and surprise developments including new characters of great interest.  I have never read a series of books where I can't keep track of all of the characters.  This is a first for me.  I can't keep track of all of Martin's characters.  I just hope he has not killed off my favorite character.  I am afraid he has.
0345803485|1.0|Holy Cow! Triple crap! My inner goddess just kicked the stuffing out of me for finishing \\"50 Shades\\" of the worst book ever written; my psyche may never recover. I'm sure this must be some type of hoax perpetrated by a 10th grader, with unsupervised access to the internet, because it's hard to believe that an adult actually wrote this drivel. Simply put, the characters are flat and uninteresting, the dialog is beyond childish, and the writing is sophomoric.  Oh, and the book has no plot. I've never read a book with no plot before, and in the future, I'll try to avoid reading another.<br /> I will say I'm not a fan of the subject matter, but I have read books by talented authors that have explored the subject matter , and I really enjoyed them. Go figure! Maybe it was the fact that the books were well written,  with a  storyline that had a purpose.<br /> I have a thing about violence against women.  About women that are abused, demoralized, and dehumanized for the enjoyment of others; call it a silly quirk of mine. There is nothing fun, or flirty , or sexy about the BDSM in this book. This man enjoys inflicting pain on woman for his enjoyment, he states it over and over. The hero *cough, cough* wants to inflict as much pain on this girl as she can tolerate for his pleasure. He stalks an innocent, young woman, and then spends the entire book trying to convince her that it's a freeing experience to be hurt and humiliated, and how much she'll enjoy the experience. I'm sorry, I just don't get it. This man is no romantic hero, and he is beyond flawed.  I'll stick with writers whose alpha males are flawed, but don't need to abuse women for their enjoyment.<br />I must say, that reading the smart and clever reviews has been more enjoyable that reading this book. ~Kate August

0307592731|5.0|Personally, this book touched me, though others have different opinions. I was touched by Cheryl's emotional journey, and also by her physical journey. I was impacted by her strength and tenacity, and also about her being honest with herself about her own flaws. She was able to face her mom's death in a clearer mind and come to terms with her life, and which one of us would not love an opportunity to do just that while also experiencing nature. I thought this book was well written, honest and even funny at times. I will try Mrs. Strayed other novel because I enjoyed her writing so much in this memoir.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Great movie. Favorite parts were played by Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister. Attracted to his assistant, so he asks that she be sent away and simply asks for another replacement. Older. Not as beautiful as the girl he asked to be replaced. Hugh has many sides re: acting, etc.

B005GFPZYK|1.0|The author is his own best critic and his own hero worshiper.  Having been in combat it is always unique for me to read how one person (normally a self proclaimed author)  could have won the war entirely by himself had he been provided with the latitude to either stay in country a bit longer or simply do as he wanted without limits.<br /><br />In this case the author knows more, does more and is more than anyone else in uniform.<br /><br />'Go Get Them Kyle\\" for I wasted money on your book but then; I will not consider it a waste since I learned that if I had used the same money to buy a beer it would have been better spent and far more enjoyable than to purchase any thing else that you write.

Incredible story and amazing ending. It is an absolute travesty that Disney did such a poor job marketing this movie, as it is clear that the majority who saw it felt the same way as me. Give us a sequel!<br /><br />Disney - advice for next time:  try a marketing campaign that doesn't spawn a crazy group of people who hate your movie before it even makes it to the movie theater.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Had a lot of action, and Tom Cruises character I think was better written.  He seemed more real in this movie than the rest.  In the previous ones, he seemed cocky and just playing the role. In this one, he seemed more of real person who has been through a lot in his life and his career.  Definitely a good buy!  Definitely the best of the series!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't interested in reading this book because I didn't think it was in my interest of genres. But I succumbed to peer pressure and was so glad I had. The Hunger Games is a good story line, full of suspense, and gets better as you get into it. Looking forward to reading the next two books in the trilogy.

B000784WMW|5.0|I have several different productions of this film.  This version is one of the best! It is lighter, more romantic, and very entertaining, as well.  Timothy Dalton is absolutely charming as Mr. Rochester.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000784WMW Jane Eyre]]
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Definitely her best production. I often listen to the CD in my car. Excellent sound quality. Her best production. No problems with the CD until now.
0756407125|2.0|On its own, the book is sorely lacking in any overarching plot.  There are a few loosely tied stories of the main character to show where he has acquired certain skills that are briefly mentioned in the first book.  Coming off the first book, it would seem that Kvothe's thoughts would be consumed by finding his troop's killers and any lore that is attached to them.  Instead, there is a collection of short stories where the character seems to divert his quest in order to have a few random adventures.  The stories are fine in their own right and are written well, but they provide nothing to the overall plot.  The book could be condensed down to 200 pages and still provide the two major plot points (Felurian and the box).<br /><br />Since the main conflict is not addressed, the book seems to wander around and end with a sigh.  A lot of work with no payoff.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|If you really like Adele you will enjoy this CD. If you are just buying it because it's trendy then I suggest you to buy 21, it is a much better production. I got the CD in perfect conditions. Can not complain.
0345803485|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey kept nagging me from its top spot on the bestseller list. Then I started to see comments on Facebook about it...so I jumped in and started reading.<br /><br />A hot single billionaire businessman, outrageously accomplished but deeply emotionally damaged, meets an innocent college senior who can barely walk on her own two feet, much less construct and execute an intelligent sentence in his presence. Inexplicably, he must have her. She meets him once, in a semi-professional capacity - a student interviewing a successful businessman and college benefactor for the student newspaper. Before you can say \\"creepy stalker\\" he has her home address, has sent her wildly inappropriate gifts worth tens of thousands of dollars, shows up three and a half hours south in her place of business, and is tracing her cell phone so that he can \\"rescue\\" her from her own drunken stupidity, back to his bed in a hotel.  This isn't romantic; this is grounds for a restraining order.<br /><br />The socially stunted and immature characters failed to engage me on any level. The two main characters are so emotionally juvenile that the book often reads as though it were written by a high-schooler. There is also no plot of any sort, which I tend to require in a book, yes - even when it's erotica. The dialogue is ridiculous - stilted and forced to the point of nonsense. The heroine is an English Lit graduate, and she talks like a 12 year old.<br /><br />When I spend ten dollars on a book from a major publisher, I have a basic expectation that the book has had at least some amount of editing and review. This book, at best, is an amateurish, poorly researched first draft.  It is in desperate need of an editor. This book is so wrong, so often, that it is not just distracting, it's obnoxious. Errors in location and dialect, grammar, usage, geography, and many more are rampant. For a while, at least, it was funny - because I could not believe it could be so ridiculously bad. That wore thin pretty quickly, however, and all that was left was to hit \\"delete.\\"
B0052GACNM|5.0|I did not know so much about Tony Bennett before I bought this CD and I think it's wonderful. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys classical or jazz music with a touch of youth.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|Rufus wainwright is always interesting, frequently fascinating, and always, just a little shy of perfect.  Except now he is.  Perfect.  Out of the game is a wonderful album of wonderful, singable pop songs.  He channels a lot of influences here, in particular classic Bowie, but he is all Rufus as well.  That wonderful, rich blurred baritone is better than ever.  H clearly learned a lot about interpretation from his time dwelling in Judy's skin, and it has served him well.  Songwriting is consistently interesting, and more I portably, his songs stick with you....tales of love, loss, failure, glory and pain.  All songs are sung with absolute conviction, honesty.  This is definitely the album that I have been waiting for from rufus, and I hope it brings him the mainstream success that he deserves.  Simply wonderful.
B006JD48NM|5.0|If you've followed F1, this film will take you back in time with both inspiring and tragic emotion. Highly recommend this.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I installed an 1/8\\" jack to play my kindle keyboard audio-books through my car stereo, but the volume wouldn't go loud enough.  This little in-line amplifier solved my problem.  It's simple to use, re-chargeable and very compact.<br /><br />There are 4 amplifier settings.  The 2nd setting boosts bass, 3rd boosts mid-range.  I use the 3rd amp setting and it's perfect.  It cleans up the sound at higher volumes and removes the airy-hiss that came from the speakers.<br /><br />I'm not an audiophile, but I think the 1st setting cleans up the sound and I'm not sure what the 4th setting does.  It's a bit quieter, clean sound.<br /><br />So kindle keyboard users, if you need to boost sound output, this is a great little device.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|This is a popular craze so I decided to try it. It was fun, but I got kind of tired flinging birds at stuff. I guess I'm not as trendy as everyone else. It is cute though.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Great helper for organizing your ideas, lists, and life in general. Color choices could be a little brighter. But the notes and the ability to create checklists are really useful. Tracking tasks by using ColorNote gives you a sense of accomplishment. You will like how easy this is to use.
1118156307|5.0|I like to do the right things but also try to do them right. This book helps conceptualizing some simple techniques in ways that can bring new results. Sometimes the simples questions are the ones we never ask ourselves and our assumptions swamp the path of effectiveness by obstructing the real goals with red-tapes and conventional thinking. This book helps regaining the centre of the purpose. It helps understanding that every piece of the service is improvable.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Design was great and the puzzles required some time and thought to figure out. Enjoyed this game and appreciated the fact that it was engaging and kept my interest.  Fire Maple can be trusted to provide a high -quality product.  For those looking for a longer game, get &quot;Lost City.&quot;  Looking forward to more Fire Maple games.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I cant believe people actually like this book! The writing style was horrible. The story was lame. The guy was a huge jerk! If Ana was my friend or daughter-i would be highly disappointed!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I love the movies in the twilight saga. It was well worth the price to order this and watch it on<br /> my kindle. When all the movies come out in a set i will be ordering them.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I bit into the hype and bought the books and read through them in three days.<br /><br />Just like Twilight.<br /><br />Unlike Twighlight, I feel like I got what I paid for.<br /><br />It's popcorn reading aimed at the masses.  It had a couple of annoyances, and at some points, I just skipped the sex scenes, cause it really got quite monotonous.  I like the third book best, actually, since there wasn't as much frackin' sex and a little more plot.<br /><br />There were things about the writing style that made me gag, like the overuse of several phrases (Oh, my...; Holy Cow!, ad nauseum).  In addition, for a book that is supposedly about BDSM and kinkiness, it really was more vanilla than anything else.  OOOh, a butt plug.  Whip me, spank me, and call me Anne Rice... ;/<br /><br />The plot was over the top, but for some reason, I wanted to know how it ended, which is why I kept reading.  So in that sense, it was a good book.  For me, the best parts were at the end of the series, when the author wrote some chapters based on Christian's POV.<br /><br />If you got the extra cash, buy them, or better yet, borrow them from a friend who's already bought them.  I'm not going to pretend this was Great Literature, but it wasn't bad, either.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I also got this light as part of a kickstarter project and have one for each wheel.  They are very bright and provide great visibility while riding.  The lights are very durable and waterproof.  You have the added security of the included metal strap for making sure the lights can't be easily stolen off of your wheels.  The only CON I have for these lights is that there should be a list of the themes and their corresponding patterns so you know what you're picking instead of trial and error.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Love playing every moment of this game, just wish there was more than 8 levels.<br /><br />Easy to navigate despite what other reviewers have said.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|read the first, was roped into starting the second, waiting to hear christain's 'big reveal', which turned out to be not so big after all. made me say 'oh, that's IT!?!?!\\" still have 100 pages left in the second book but have no desire to finish it. the plot and writing are so annoyingly repetitive that ive started skimming whole pages just to move along. there are so many other GOOD books out there, waiting to be read, that i dont feel the need to waste my time finishing this series. The author either needs a refresher class in writing or a better editor bc the writing overall is immature, repetitive and just flat out dull.......<br /><br />the only reason i started this series was because, being such an avid reader, i was curious to see what all the hype was about. the fact that such mundane literature like this is sitting atop the NYT bestseller list saddens me. (actually, it should not even be referred to as 'literature'!!) what has society come to??
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the series and read all three books within a few days. As I finished one, I would hurriedly began the next - anxious to see what was in store.  I was a little disappointed with the ending but it made sense with all the events that occurred in the books.  I know it was written with teens as the target audience, but my teen years have not been in sight for a few decades, and I enjoyed each book!
B007FH9GT2|1.0|Your system would not let view movie since I was in France. It charged me for the movie. I rate it poorly.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This is without doubt one of the finest Blu-ray discs I have purchased (and I own hundreds!).  I could not believe what I was viewing and hearing.  I have always loved the music but had never seen the musical and am very grateful that a friend recommended this Blu-ray to me because I am still in awe (just watched it last evening). Perfect example of why Broadway plays & musicals should be filmed for those of us that cannot get to New York to see them. A stunning production!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very much enjoyed this book. The most enlightening was Isaacson's description of the level at which Job's operated. Job's concept of  \\"A\\" players working together was enlightening. Job's  informal approach to discussions and debates and his willingness to receive open comment in meetings providing improved  transparency , and democratization of input were admirable and a lesson to many.<br />.<br />Isaacson describes clearly how Job's doing different things and doing the same thing differently led to Apples  growth.<br /><br />Isaacson's book is an inspirational work that will provide motivation for generations to come. A must read for those who enjoy and are inspired by a healthy diet  of biography.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is the best it reminds me of super Mario from we I was little.the coins Remus me of the good times when I played it
B004JZ66VY|5.0|You can never go wrong with this movie. The music is outstanding and to serve it up with a spoonful of sugar makes it excellent for the whole family.  A classic I will buy each time the format changes (VHS,DVD, Digital)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is awesome!  It has never let me down and I've had it for three months now.  I love the ability to set multiple alarms each with unique sound and snooze settings.  I've been looking for a timer, too, and finally noticed this app has timers as well! Worth it without a doubt!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a very good read :) the character development was. astounding I super liked when the one guy slept with a prostitute. THAT JESUSE GUY IS SUPER SWELL AND IT WSS NEAT WHEN HE PWNED THE LEGION DEMON S GUY. and then the demon s killed the piggers. that was pretty neat. the other day my fog was telling me hoe good this book is. I would say that its so good. I read it religiously. ridiculously photogenic guy and philosophyrsptor and conspiracy kuenan agree :(
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The book is great. Love the characters and the silent yet strong Logan. I thought it was much better than the movie.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I downloaded this on my kindle fire.  I opened it up and played a game,  I played it for<br />awhile then finished . that's when my kindle froze. Same thing happen to my evo cell phone I got a virus!

B007HIEBV2|5.0|Great Album, love every song in it.  Definitely worth the money.  If you liked their first album this is a must have.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Now I bought the audio book of this at a different site. When I first stared listening to this book I was not pulled in yet. The book started out slow for me, the inner dialogue was not as upper level as I am used to. However, as the book developed the inner dialogue developed with the character. The characters are this deep array of complexity. They have flaws and particularities. Mr. Gray has one towards food that has not yet been revealed. He is a strong male lead, and written with a definite commanding presence. Anna is at first shy and yielding but grows slightly bolder with what she wants.
0439023521|4.0|The first book in this series is the best one. It focus on a dystopia in the future. It reminded me of a cross between \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" probably more closer to the latter. Katniss is the main character and the story is told through her perspective, I will let you decide whether or not you like her. She has many admirable qualities in this first book. Going into the world of the Hunger Games it is such an original plot (although it is similar to \\"Battle Royale by Koushun Takami), about a society that makes its twelve districts send two children to an enclosed arena and to fight to the death. Of course it is a little more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it. I  recommend everyone to read at least the first book because it is a very easy read. It is young adult and can be finished quite quickly, however the substance of the book is still there even if it is a young adult book. On a side note...I did see the movie after I read the first book and thought the movie really edited out major plot points in the book. The movie did do a great job of capturing the moments before the games, but lacked showing the intensity of the games and Katniss's relationship to Rue.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible program I have found for any mobile device. Plus, notes, plans, and bookmarks are synced to all devices you use.
0439023491|3.0|The second Hunger Game's book starts off strong it. And we are introduced to some great characters and say goodbye to others. The writing is great because you can visualize everything being written with such vivid details. While I applaud the authors' creativity, I was still waiting for some extreme surprise to happen when I was reading, while there were a few nothing quite blew me away. While the ending is gripping and we do get to see a different side of Katniss and she becomes a much better rounded character, I was still waiting for some ridiculously interesting plot twist. I thought Petta was written weaker in this book versus the first one. I'm interested in how they will do in making this book into a movie, since there are SO many unique characters.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am enjoying the evernote.<br /><br /> I can jot down thoughts. put notes on a paper to look at later. it has helped me with getting things out from my head so I can work on them later. I would recommend. getting this app to everyone.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Great read. More detailed than the movie. Also better than the movie.The part of how Bill James figures this out is unreal. I understand better now how Theo is running the Cubs.
B006ZZCLV0|4.0|The books I received arrived much faster than schedule (the scheduled time was close to a month from date of purchase).  It shipped from the UK and arrived in the US undamaged.  The books were printed in UK English, so the metric system is used throughout.  I really liked this, but others may not.  Overall, I loved the quality and condition of the books, and the speed of delivery.  The only negative was the books spine was slightly weaker than I would have like, but the book holds up under my abusive bending while reading.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Just love simply cause I can record my daily intake of true news reporting from the INFOWARS.COM WARRIOR ALEX JONESSSSSSS..... and it also has the previous broadcasts of shows. In this titanic battle between Good and Evil you need the true news and TuneIn Radio Pro is now part of the weapons of the infowar!!!!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|i was interested in reading the books due to all the hype. I was surprised, the book (e-book) was hard to put down.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|can't turn it off<br />only problem for me is the social aspect. I hate it when friends on facebook send me game requests.  I just want to play a game without being judged by my friends.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This app is terrific. It provides up to the minute information that is accurate. The 10 day forecast is very useful for planning, and all of the information is forecasted, not just precipitation and temperatures. Also, if the information is not updating fast enough, you can change forecasters and will generally get an update immediately. I like having the &quot;feel like&quot; temperature available, also. I love the weather clock and the choice of widgets, too. I can't say enough about this app - buy it!
B002NXSRVG|4.0|Big classic movie, I love it! Thanks for all the action that make us remember since we were kids, just very funny.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the only problem I have is visiting friends it tells me to restart and I do and it says restart again only one I can visit is scrat ....
B00785P2QC|5.0|soooooo fun. I have waisted a lot of time on this game. I very much suggest everyone to get this game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you like Mario, you'll love this. I was one of those ppl that loonies over the reviews but its really goood expesally for the fire!!
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I'll count myself among the masses of come-late readers who got sucked into the (now 5) novels after watching the show. HBO seems committed to following the books to the conclusion so long as it's economically viable (just renewed through season 3 which will cover 1/2 of book 3) meaning we could easily 10 years here (at a minimum 7 novels and some split to two seasons).<br /><br />::::Though I don't consider them spoilers, some plot set-up follows in the next paragraphs::::<br /><br />At first impression GOT, based very closely on George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, is a story about the Stark family, lords of the North in the mythical land of Westeros. Lord Eddard Stark is called upon by his childhood friend, partner in rebellion and now King of the Seven Kingdoms, to take the position of Hand of the King and travel south to Kings Landing to basically rule the kingdom while Robert \\"hunts, drinks and whores himself to an early grave. The family must divide up, the eldest son Robb, his mother and two youngest brothers remain in their home Winterfell, Ned and their two daughters (the eldest now betrothed to the crowned prince)travel to Kings Landing while Ned's Bastard son goes north to \\"the wall\\" (a 700 ft miles long wall of solid ice separating the \\"wild\\" north) to join the black guard.<br /><br />Very quickly all semblance of peace is gone. Stark learns that the old hand may have been murdered, the queen may have born her children out of incest and a move to grab the thrown may be in play. Meanwhile the last decedents of the over-thrown king are in the east, the vanquished prince has traded his sister as wife to a massive tribe of horse-lord barbarians in exchange for an army to march into Kings Landing to re-take the throne.<br /><br />A death late in the season sent some viewers crying fowl and running from the show, though, it's merely following the book and is the catalyst for the events of the next for novels.<br /><br />The show appears to have been shot digitally, not a bad thing, but blu-ray hounds will note the grainy look, but it saves a ton of money and the show cost over $50,000,000 for 10 episodes (season two is 15 - 25 million over that yet). The DTS-HD track is fine, though the nuance sounds you get in a theatrical film aren't there to begin with, nor are they required. The production values are excellent, no visual effect looks cheap, nor do you ever have to take the show with a grain of salt because it's not a theatrical film. The show is also relentless in gore, sex and explicit nudity as well as language, this is not for children or the easily offended.<br /><br />The acting is near flawless and the dialogue well written if not verbatim from the book. The one issue is the heightened age of everyone in the story. All the children are 2 - 3 years older than the book, the Starks should be at the most in mid to late thirties are pushing fifty. No idea why the did this, anymore than I understand casting a woman in her mid-twenties to play the 13 year old Dany (except they couldn't have a 13 year old with all the nudity and sex.) In the long-run though it will add up to continuity issues in a story where keeping track of when-what-happened is already hell. As the plot gets thicker and more complex in the next seasons the writers are going to have to alter history a bit to fit the age difference's in. But when Dany's older brother looks at the 24 year old woman and says \\"you have a woman's body now\\" it sounds really stupid because, yeah, she's had it for 10 years!<br /><br />The issue with the Blu-Ray is the menus. For some idiotic reason each disk has the same, exact menu options, even if the content of the link isn't available on that disk. So done watching EP2? Click EP3 and a message \\"insert disk 2\\" comes up. Same thing with extras.  And there's \\"In Episode\\" feature, an annoying drop down you have to keep clicking through rather than a \\"pop-up\\" feature that feeds you facts as you relax and enjoy.<br /><br />It's a great show, really alone in it's class and puts Spartacus to shame in a hundred different ways. Absolutely worth the Blu-Ray set and books. It's also noteworthy that there's such a depth to the story and mythology you can watch these over and over and keep coming away with new information you missed or didn't get before.br /><br />It's a great show, really alone in it's class and puts Spartacus to shame in a hundred different ways.

B000G75994|4.0|The sound is nice but I do not understand why the cd No.2 when played with my pc does not show the right pieces that are played in the real player.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Spielberg really knows how to make a story come from the heart. Joey, the War Horse, shows an almost human intelligence to all the beings in his life. This is a wonderful movie for horse lovers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Especially the tap to move feature! I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing Sol in Windows. As for the ads I don't mind them.
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|My parents borrowed this movies off redbox and they said its very bloody, especially near the end. The main character hardly ever talks which only builds the tension of the film. You won't realize he's a bit of a psychopath until the very end. Not for anyone who can't stand blood. Parents beware of kids under 21 watching this!
B0073PZIYI|1.0|This was an awful movie. I like sci if and thought the previews looked good. The movie was confusing (time is really money in this movie) and total dullsville. I do not recommend this.
B0053O89WY|4.0|Seasons 1-3 were unbelievably funny, hands down 5 stars.  They had me a bit worried at the beginning of season 4, but everything took off nicely and it came on strong to earn 5 stars.  As for season 5, while this is still one of the funniest, if not the funniest show on TV right now, it's simply not as funny.  I will say, just about the time I'm thinking maybe a particular episode is not \\"making it,\\" something happens or is said that makes me laugh out loud and saves it.<br /><br />I use to find Howard and Raj very funny, now I find them a bit pathetic.  It may be that they've always been a bit pathetic but the show was just so fast paced and funny that I didn't notice that much.  I do believe they moved much too quickly into the Howard and Bernadette wedding/marriage thing.  It may just be me, but the Penny and Leonard characters seem, at times, to be just going through the motions . . . a bit distant or disconnected (I blame the writers and director, not the actors).  Sheldon seems to have put on a pound or two; his face and neck seem much fuller.  It may be that the very, very successful and award winning actor playing the part is now living the good life a bit.  It seems to change the character a bit; it seems to give his facial expressions (which have always been hilarious) less impact.  All and all, it's still a very funny show.<br /><br />Edit May 3, 2012:  Interestingly, tonight's episode (the day after my posting above) was quite good and very funny.  Another episode this good, and I'll have to go to 4 1/2 stars. ;-)<br /><br />Edit August 20, 2012:  Well, with all things said and done, I give the 5th Season 4 1/2 stars without reservation!  They've got everything in place to have a 5 Star 6th Season, I really hope they pull it off.  I've grown very fond of the characters in the show.  Good luck on making the 6th Season another winner.<br /><br />Edit January 13, 2013:  The 6th Season is very interesting.  I do believe the \\"gals\\" are stealing the show.  Forme the funniest scenes have been those involving the girls.  The episode a few nights ago had me laughing out loud when the \\"gals\\" found themselves arguing over the Hammer of Thor . . . funny stuff.

B007TNS6JI|3.0|This game has potential to be a phenomenal app, however, it's unbearably glitchy to the point where I haven't the slightest clue what's going on... if Gameloft could fix that then this would easily be the best app I have on my kindle fire.

B007DX39XW|5.0|Item arrived very promptly, no issues there. Amazon outer carton was in excellent condition upon arrival, however once opened I found that the LEGO box was crushed on all four corners and was OPENED on both ends!! They didn't even bother tapping up the ends before putting it in the outer carton :( One of the clear bags inside the box containing LEGO pieces was ripped opened and the pieces mixed through the other bags. Until the set is made by the recipient of the gift I do not know if there are any missing parts? Very upset with the condition the LEGO box arrived in as this was meant to be a gift, I'm embarrassed of its presentation. Instruction manuals not damaged. This set is huge, will be great fun putting it together, and an excellent addition to the LEGO Creator series. Just disappointing to receive a \\"Brand New\\" item looking more like Seconds.

0345803485|1.0|The plot is boring; the characters have no depth; the same phrasing is used over and over.  I would not recommend this book, nor do I have any interest in the other 2 shades of grey books.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|In short A Dangerous Method has a very captivating story line. I found the movie to be well done and very easy to follow. I just wished that at times it would have been a little more in depth. I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|The rest of the reviews tell you about the story line, I just wanted to add that this movie was actually really good.  I've seen A LOT of Hollywood movies, in the theaters, that don't add up to this.  Just goes to show, if you've got a good story, and good acting, you don't need millions to make a good movie.  The movie is interesting, intense in parts, and I even liked the ending...  Wow... so cool!
B006KSAPV0|5.0|I think by far this has been one of Pedro Almod&oacute;var most thought provoking movies in recent years. It keeps your attention through out the film. The subtitles were easy to read. I purchased the combo pack for the DVD and found that it played with out any problem. So in short if you enjoy a thought provoking drama I highly recommend it.
B006P8KKYW|5.0|The Immigrant Song is the only one with vocals and is a great cover.  Everything else is instrumental and it is very soothing.  I didn't like the movie, but the soundtrack is great!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am new at both Kindle and Android so it has taken some time to become adept at working both,but i am blown away by both. Kindle for Android is a wonderful tool when you want to read but don't have a book with you,but with this you have a library!simple to use i am getting a Kindle Fire in a few weeks.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible! My favorite thing is having it read to me so I know how names and places are pronounced. The only bad thing is it doesn't always read exactly as what I have in front of me - but it's not exact at church either. Definate thumbs up!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The series of books are great! Only problem you do not want them to stop! I have read them all now wanting for the next book which may take to 2013!!! It will be worth the wait.
B001NLKT60|4.0|So many of the reviewers state this much better than I can. I just wanted to add my stars. This 2nd book in the series wasn't quite as good as the 1st. I have already started the 3rd & I am having trouble putting it down!

0143034901|5.0|This is a book for those who love reading and those who love books; the thrill of hunting down obscure volumes, and the mystery of putting life to long-lost authors. It's a book about love, jealousy, deception, revenge, forgiveness, the lies we tell ourselves, growing up, and trying to escape one's past. It's filled with grotesque, yet perfectly believable characters, who you can't help but despise for their human frailty and foolishness even as you sympathise with their weaknesses. The story itself is filled with twists and turns, slowly unfolding like a crushed origami crane, and keeping you turning the pages until the bath water goes cold or you can't stay awake any longer.<br /><br />I loved the unusual setting. Spain in the early 20th century was racked by the Civil War, and then managed to sit out the Second World War; as a result, it doesn't feel like most stories set in the period 1930-1950. It feels otherworldly, but at the same time real, and it's left me wanting to revisit Barcelona to see the places mentioned all through the book; not just the big Gaudi tourist attractions, but the small streets, the cafes, and even the bookshops. It's like wanting to wander round Oxford after reading Philip Pullman, or taking a road trip across America after reading Gaiman's American Gods.<br /><br />As other critics have noted, I was reminded throughout of Umberto Eco, Jorge Luis Borges, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I'd also add Salman Rushdie, another personal favourite of mine. I regard them as four of the greatest writers of the 20th century, and to my mind, Zafon belongs up there with them. I'll admit that I've only read them mostly in translation (I managed a bit of Borges and some Marquez in my Spanish courses when I was 16-17, and haven't even tried learning Italian to tackle Eco), and it's the same with Shadow, but the translation by Lucia Graves, daughter of the great Robert Graves, is absolutely masterful. It's poetic, and it has the same lilting flow I expect from Spanish writing.<br /><br />This is one of those books that demonstrates why I don't give many 5-star ratings. When I read a book like this, I want it to stand out head and shoulders above those books that are merely good, or even very good. This is, without a doubt, one of the best books I've read in recent years.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the sort of literary writers I mentioned above, then I can't recommend this book highly enough.from Spanish writing.<br /><br />This is one of those books that demonstrates why I don't give many 5-star ratings.

B0053TMP24|2.0|the characters are not amusing, the jokes are not funny at all, and despite the length of the book, it only has a skeleton of the plot, no sideshows or details at all, just bones of a very boring story. What happened to the laughter of Percy Jackson? Every character is ridiculously stretched to be complicated or purely good or evil, and they are all flat and depressing to read. This series has turned out to be a major depression.
B006WXW098|5.0|We are at the cusp of transition from one generation of pianists to another, but a name stands out as exception to clear distinction between grand old musicians and brilliant young talent. Yuja Wang doesn't fit into those (arbitrary) boxes.<br /><br />At only 25, Yuja (her own preference for second reference) is an old soul, and seemingly in the vanguard for a long, long time. In fact, it's been a dozen years - half her life - that she's been winning international contests and hearts around the world, plus engagements with major orchestras, so she is neither a newcomer nor a member of the &lt;em>ancien r&eacute;gime&lt;/em>. She is what she is, one of the finest pianists - and, importantly, musicians - of our time.<br /><br />And she has now produced her fourth Deutsche Grammophon CD, \\"Fantasia,\\" which follows [...]\\"Sonatas & Etudes\\"&lt;/a> (2009), [...]\\"Transformation&lt;/em>\\" (2010), and [...]\\"Rachmaninov\\"&lt;/a> (2011).<br /><br />It is a varied, capricious, collection of miniatures, just a few minutes each, the longest being a 10-minute tribute to Mickey Mouse - quite a change since the large-scale collection of \\"Transformation.\\"<br /><br />Almost all tracks come from Yuja's large storehouse of encores; she needs many because her recital audiences unvariably demand - and almost always - receive them.<br /><br />Four brief Rachmaninov [not Rachmaninoff, according to this album] pieces lead the way, played with unshowy brilliance, power, and her usual complete authority over the keyboard. The stormy &Eacute;tude-tableau in A minor Op. 39 No. 6 is a grand calling card; Op. 39 No. 4 is swift, playful; Op. 39 No. 5 has a quiet, but persistent romantic sweep.<br /><br />&Eacute;l&eacute;gie in E flat minor Op. 3 No. 1, wisely slipped in between No. 4 and No. 5, is meandering, Chopinesque, a change from the mood shared by the &Eacute;tude-tableaux.<br /><br />Scarlatti, a Yuja perennial, appears here only with the two-minute-long Sonata in G major K. 455, an irresitible melodic cascade of pearls, over before you can catch your breath.<br /><br />For contrast, the poignant Melody from Gluck's \\"Orfeo ed Euridice\\" follows, giving way to Alb&eacute;niz's sweeping \\"Triana,\\" from Iberia, Book II.<br /><br />One of Yuja's heroes, Vladimir Horowitz, is responsible for two transcriptions: the Gypsy Song, from Bizet's \\"Carmen,\\" and the CD-closing virtuoso \\"Dance macabre,\\" by Saint-Saëns (in Liszt's arrangement). The \\"Carmen\\" excerpt is marked \\"White House version\\" because it became famous in Horowitz's televised White House concert in 1978.<br /><br />There are many other cuts, including a superb collection of five Scriabin miniatures, but let's get back to Mickey Mouse. Everybody's favorite rodent will inevitably come to mind while listening to Yuja's tempestuous \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice,\\" in Victor Staub's arrangement.<br /><br />The Disney film is now showing in San Francisco's Disney Family Museum, but meanwhile, enjoy Yuja's tribute to it.ody from Gluck's \\"Orfeo ed Euridice\\" follows, giving way to Albéniz's sweeping \\"Triana,\\" from Iberia, Book II.

B000ZM1MG4|5.0|This is a classic and great to chill out and watch on a rainy day. Funny and sad at the same time.
0345803485|1.0|that this book ever got published!!!!  Much less 3 of them.  Poorly written, pathetic main character and arrogant, abusive male character.  I am definitely appalled at the \\"following\\" the book has.  What about this book was the least bit appealing?

0061726834|5.0|Delirum by Lauren Oliver is by far the most over the top, buckle your seat belts and hold on roller coaster ride of your life. The intensity of this book leaves you breathless at the end. Again another book with the main character's face on the page giving you the visualization of the person who's world you are beginning to understand.    In a world where love is being stripped from your brain at the age of eighteen because it is said that it's a disease. A world where the government not only monitors but controls every aspect of your life, your career, your financial stability and arranges the people who you are supposed to spend the rest of your life with simply by an evaluation scheduled right after your graduation. This is the world that Lena lives in. We begin with Lena who's life we follow as she nears the time of her procedure. She's a senior in high school and is about to graduate. She's getting closer to the day of her evaluation and the suspense is killing her. She's ready to have all of this behind her. But that's until she meets Alex. Her entire world seems like it's going to collapse one Lena finally opens her eyes and can see clearer. Her entire world begins to fall apart when she begins to doubt everything that has been instilled in her head since the day her mother died. And to make matter's more confusing she meets Alex. Gets to know him, starts to like him and ends up falling in love with him.    The characters in this story make the story come alive. I instantly fell in love with Lena as I felt the emotions she felt. I felt as if I was living in her world and experiencing the same things she was. Lauren Oliver did a fascinating job with the descriptions of the people who have been cured and the ones who haven't. The difference between the government and the people. She specified how and who controlled this world and the consequences should you deny your or in this case resist the procedure or their way of living. The most incriminating part was the Crypts. I couldn't believe how descriptive it was and how I was able to imagine every single detail from there as if I was inside this story. Lauren Oliver is definitely in my favorite author's list. The way she captivates you from the very first page and throws blow upon blow in every chapter leaves you like an addict wanting more. If you haven't read Delirium, you HAVE to go a grab it. You will not regret it and if you have already, pick up the next book in the series called Pandemonium and stay tuned for my review of Pandemonium. If you have read Pandemonium already, pick up Hana's which is a short novella ebook of Hana's story in the book Delirum. And stay tuned for information on the third installment of this remarkable book Requiem later this year.    I hightly recommend this book to anyone who loves a great story! You will not be disappointed.    [...]
B006JN5KBG|5.0|The High Definition version is available in iTunes for $17.99. I'm sure it will be available in blu-ray at a reasonable price...and since the iTunes version is in full 1080 there is no reason to buy it at this price.  Excellent flick by the way.

B005UG542S|4.0|this was probably as good an ending as they could get. It tied up all the loose ends and did it justice. the four stars are because of all the harry potter movies, this is not the best one! worth buying or seeing though.
B007HO392S|5.0|Note to self, dont base an artist or an album on sneekpeeks of songs. When the sneekpeeks came out, the only song I liked was Good Girl and instantly made up my mind the rest of the album sucked. Fans lashed out at me but my stubborn mind was set- I was ready to put it up on Ebay or give it to a friend who loves CU as much as I do, for free. I'm only on the 5th song and I love the entire album so far. Carrie really knows what she's doing, Thank God.<br /><br />Cheap and excellent songs. 5/5.<br /><br />*By cheap, I mean that it didn't cost but just about $10 or so b/c I pre-ordered it. I dont want any of you who read this to take it the wrong way :)
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is a great movie. It has a great story-line behind it. I think I have seen this movie daily since purchasing a copy. My almost 2 year old seems to really enjoy the music and the little yellow minions... especially the part where a couple of them are next to a water tank station sticking their tongues in and out. (He copies). Another favorite part for him is when Agnes asks Gru if a noise he makes with her hands and cheeks is annoying (My son is too cute - he copies this to, to the best of his ability, and he laughs). It may be a movie that he likes watching, over and over and over... but I don't mind this one. Adults will enjoy it as well.
B0073XORCY|3.0|I have to say that I looked forward to hearing this with quite a bit of trepidation: the decrepit state of Ian's voice, the absence of Martin Barre, and the sheer audacity of attempting a \\"sequel\\" to Jethro Tull's greatest musical achievement sounded like a recipe for disaster if there ever was one, but I eventually overcame my misgivings, and gave it a listen. Surprise: it doesn't suck. In fact, it's not bad at all. Ian wisely sticks to keys that accommodate his present-day vocal ability, and manages to coax a very \\"Martinesque\\" performance out of guitarist Florian Ophale, while reaching back successfully to Tull's \\"progressive\\" period in his composing. Sly musical references to the original (as well as to A Passion Play) add to the enjoyment of an album that while nowhere near the level of its predecessor, certainly ranks among the best recent work from Ian, and a worthy addition to any Tull fan's collection. 3.5 stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I loved this game. so fun. I love ice age. this is perfect for any age. its awesome! play it now :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have ben waiting a long time to get it on my kindle fire and its finally here!!! some are complaining that they hate it because it wont work on their kindles but it works GREAT on mine:))))
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|While watching this movie I kept going back to Steve Mc Queen in Ryan Gosling's acting. His use of facial expressions in which Mc Queen used his entire career were outstanding. I wouldn't doubt that Gosling has studied Mc Queens acting mannerisms. He does look quite a bit like a young Steve Mc Queen as well. Albert Brooks was great and a departure from his usual comedy rolls. The ending has a \\"Shane\\" type where you are not sure what happens to the \\"Driver\\". All in all I thought it was a great movive even with all the bloody gore.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read all three books of the trilogy in 9 days.  But not because it was riveting and I couldn't put it down.  Mostly because I am not a quitter and I was intent on finishing.  And the characters were somewhat interesting.  I found the writing to be repetitive, monotonous, at times tedious.  I enjoyed the premise of the story and the direction that James began with; however, the sex became completely gratuitous, overdone, deterring from the plot.  I think she easily could have made this into just one book, two at the most.  I would not recommend this; after all they hype the books have received, I was highly disappointed.  I had heard it called \\"Twilight for adults\\" but I found the Twilight series to be much more engaging, not as repetitive, and the characters being less predictible.  I will probably go see the film, since they would have to eliminate some of the sex.  Perhaps that will make the plot and character struggles more prominent.  Perhaps.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book has had an incredible impact on me since I've read it. Aside from being inspirational, motivating and moving, there are so many lessons to be gleaned from Steve Jobs's life and his experiences. Though there is no doubt that Jobs was not an easy person to work with or deal with, his passion, dedication, and focus were incredible qualities that helped to fortify solid results for Apple and to drive change. The marrying of innovation with aesthetics is also noteworthy and inspires me to do the same in my profession. The world is a better place for having had Steve Jobs be a part of it for the time he was on the planet. The human race is poorer for his early departure. Thank you, Steve, for teaching us how it can be, if we only dare...

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|love this game! ! very addicting but something weird happened the last time I got on. I have 12 plots for growing crops and 4 med centers n I went to check the progress and its saying I have 315 mine left till my crops and medicine will be done? ???? I don't know what happen everything was fine then that out of no where and its running very slow. does anyone know y?? or what to do to fix it?

B0055B7IPE|5.0|My family had been telling me to rent this for a long time. We finally did and were unbelievably surprised how good it was. It did not feel like it was made for children; as an adult, I was entirely engrossed in the movie. But it is definitely something the kiddies can watch. Bravo! Well done. I seriously would rank it as one of my favorite movies. What a pleasant surprise.
1582406723|5.0|I loved it, can't wait to read vol 2. This is the first graphic novel I have read and I really like it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I only downloaded this game to see what it was about. Now I can't put the game down. It's a lot of fun and is easy for a kid!!
0307949486|5.0|With over 3,000 reviews already, there is not much to say. I found it superb, interesting. I understand why it hit all the must read lists and is now a movie (actually two movies because the Swedes made their movie first.)<br />I must add however, some of the details are quite greusome and probably should not be read by young adults.  Some of the financial wizardy was way beyond my understanding - but I really did not need to understand all of it to get the point of the shell games that were being played.<br />The heroine is unusual and in this book her story (why she is the way she is) is only hinted at. That is for the next book.<br />While the first half of the book moved steadily the second half is a \\"I can't put it down.\\" However the first half with all the characters and the establishment of the mystery makes the second even more riveting.<br />I have already ordered the second book from Amazon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book, loved the movie, and am now reading the second book of the series.  Great purchase!  I can't wait for them to come out with the next movie now!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I find this series to be...addictive.  Martin does a great job with character development, and you really feel like you're diving into the world of the Game of Thrones.  This installment, while having less action creates a tension from the build-up of what may happen in the next book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a lot like frontierville. I love it.  you should try it. my daughter told me about it.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I was really bummed when I watched this movie, because I made it half way through before realizing that this was not a sequel to the movie Iron Man. It's not even a lame spin off. This movie sucks!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My wife and I have used Gary Chapman's \\"The Five Love Languages:The Secret to Love that Lasts\\" as a marriage counseling tool for years.  It is still eye-opening to couples as they learn how to love their mate as thye desire to be loved.  Couples are amazed to learn that they love the way they want to be loved, but are often blind to their mates' unique love language.  What a difference it makes when you begin to express love to you mate through their love language.
B004EPYZV2|1.0|Tom Cruise has stayed too long at the fair. severe looks, earnest emoting, and a swagger better left to someone who should, this piece of tripe was impossible for me to get all the way through. special effects were decent, but aren't they always in a movie with this much \\"action\\". no, my beef was with the juvenile dialogue and the ham-laden overacting, especially from Cruise.<br />in my opinion, don't waste your time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its kind of a knockoff from Mario...but fun! I like the graphics too. its fun shooting the acorns and getting the pots of gold.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|I received this set as a gift from my parents, unsuspecting that I would be blown away by the story and visual effects.  Put simply, Thor is an epic masterpiece that stands as a great movie in and of its own.  A newly-discovered Chris Hemsworth, briefly seen as impromptu Captain George Kirk in 2009's reboot of Star Trek, fills the lead role of Thor with impressive talent.<br /><br />Also a fan of Star Wars, I found Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker to be a little soft, especially in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (though for the record, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie).  I mean, c'mon, this guy was supposed to become the ULTIMATE bad guy 30 years in the making.  Instead of seeing what we were to believe was a noble warrior gone rogue, we were treated with a whiny, sniffling, bratty kid who ultimately served as a real letdown in the end.  THIS was Darth Vader?!?  Hemsworth's acting convinced me that if he were to have been given a lightsaber that he would have more than adequately filled the role that Hayden Christensen should have manned up to.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth portrays Thor as a god who is stripped of his power and forced to live the cold, harsh reality of humanity.  Does he demonstrate weakness and humility that characterizes his human counterparts?  Absolutely, albeit with a noble demeanor.  The audience can feel the emotional pain along with Thor, thanks to Hemsworth's talent.  However, the feeling he gives the character far surpasses that of a whiny, bratty little kid.  George Lucas would have done MUCH, MUCH better to have cast Hemsworth as Sith protege.  Darth Vader would have been a much more believable character evolution were this the case.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|First of all, I should mention that this book does not stand alone and does not end. When I got to the last page, I tried to flip forward and was dismayed that there was nothing else. It ends very abruptly. But it is also the first book in the trilogy, so to continue, you have to move on to books 2 and 3.<br /><br />The writing in the first chapter is pretty bad. I almost gave up. What made me keep reading was simply curiosity, wondering what all the fuss was about with this book.<br /><br />From chapter two on I was hooked. The writing is ok. It's not as bad as all the indignant one star reviews would lead you to believe. Like Twilight, this book is not about the quality of the writing, it's the story. The love story.<br /><br />That's why people are raving about this book and racing through all three volumes. Sure the sex bits are interesting, but it's the growth of the characters, particularly the enigmatic Christian Grey that is riveting. This story is a fantasy on all levels and it's the characters intense love that drives the story. They are characters you root for.<br /><br />This is a fun read, and a peek into a world most of us know little about. I look forward to the movie, a modern 9 1/2 weeks.<br />Enjoy!
B0055SWM08|1.0|The game is easy for about 30 minutes, then you quickly have to think harder, longer and there's no way to get additional hints.  My idea of fun is NOT spending 45 minutes on how to get the raindrop out in six moves or whatever.  Found the game a huge waste of time and an unpleasant experience.  The level of progression doesn't just get a little harder, it goes from easy to almost impossible.  Wish I could get a refund of my 99 cents -that's how annoyed I am!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|game ok but controls and instructions are a pain. still a bit addictive and fun. can see it as 5 star with better game control and better instructions. price is right for it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was just looking for a good book with a lot of good reviews and I stumbled onto this one. Amazing how much life Hugh put into a world on the brink of death. It is easy to imagine every character and every scene in this book. The first page turns a little slow, the next faster, and so on until you can't put this thing down. It's the best book I've read in a long long time. I only slept 2 hours last night. I liked it so much and I had to learn a little more about the author, and I am captivated by the story... he is (was) an unknown author who just wrote this last year and kept his day job as the book explodes in sales. Great Job Hugh!
B000002J2F|5.0|Genesis hadn't fully formed into the Phil Collins band yet, but they were about too. Duke was the last in a line of the old style, and a wonderful piece of music. \\"Behind The Lines,\\" is a classic Genesis progressive rock song and \\"Dutchess\\" is very much like older \\"Nursery Crimes\\" style. \\"Guide Vocal\\" is wonderfully done by Phil and Tony. Next is the Mike Rutherford written \\"Man of Our Times\\" which is a great progressive rock song. \\"Misunderstanding\\" is our introduction to the Phil Collins band style that would take over the band from here on out. \\"Heathaze\\" on the other hand is a Tony Banks masterpiece. Just so I'm not misunderstood, Phil Collins is a terrific singer and damn he sings this one good.<br /><br />\\"Turn It On Again\\" was a huge hit and is a Genesis classic liked by both groups of fans. \\"All I need is a TV show, live on the radio.\\" Mike Rutherford wrote \\"Alone Again\\" and its in the style that he would use in his own band Mike and The Mechanics. The next song on the CD is one of the best ever done by this band: \\"Cul-de-sac\\" was written by Tony and its what symphonic progressive rock is all about.<br /><br />Phil chips in with \\"Please Don't Ask,\\" which is a typical Phil ballad, but he wrote few better. If this one doesn't ring a bell with you, then you had a better love life than me. I have drowned my sorrow to this tune more than once. \\"Dukes Travels\\" and \\"Dukes End\\" take up the last ten minutes of this masterpiece and if you don't like it, you just don't get what Genesis was. A unique band in the history of the business.<br /><br />Phil Collins is the best drummer of his era. Tony Banks is a master of the keyboard and symphonic melody, he has no equal in that regard. Mike Rutherford can lay down a great bass line whether it be complicated progressive music or commercial classic rock, he wasn't bad on guitar either. The wildcard here is the multi talented Phil Collins. He is a wonderful singer and showmen and once he made it, it was hard to shut it down.This would be their last 5 star album, but they made some good albums after and some would say that this was the beginning of Genesis and not the end.<br /><br />Those who listen to modern neo-prog or symphonic prog, this is where it came from. They were the best and this album is a masterpiece in progressive rock history and no list of the best of that genre should be without it. Duke is the best of Phil Collins band Genesis and one of the best albums in the history of progressive rock. At least 5 stars.
B003E48AYC|2.0|Alice in Wonderland is the tale of a little girl lost in a land of nonsense. A land of NONSENSE!<br />This movie has hardly any nonsense at all. It feels more like a Harry Potter movie than Alice in Wonderland. I wanted Alice. Alice get's trapped in a surreal dream-like Wonderland where everything is nonsense and there is tons of wordplay, puns, ect.<br />And the nerve to name the movie Alice in Wonderland. It's not that story. They should've named it Return to Wonderland: The Battle to Make a Harry Potter movie with Alice Characters.
0345803493|1.0|I finished reading book 2 in this 'harlequin romance of bondage' series. What a pathetic attempt at writing erotica. I am now regarding this as the publishing equivalent of the \\"Blair Witch Project\\" in that everyone is duped into seeing/buying into it and then realizing they were scammed after they own them. If this writing is so hot that it has gotten Soccer Moms excited, they must have the most non-existent, boring sex lives in the world because these books are as far from erotic as dry white toast and chicken broth.<br /><br />There is no sensuality. There bondage scenes are only titillating to 6th grade girls who've never known anything about sex--and if Christian is such an experienced Dom, his 'training' of her to accept him is a hysterical joke for their 'scene' in the pleasure room [yawn]. If you haven't read this series and really want to---borrow it from someone else. If you want some good BDSM erotic literature look elsewhere--I would suggest the Sleeping Beauty series by A. N Rocquelare (Anne Rice)because the sex scenes in here seem dictated by a bored teen with no knowledge of what really occurs in a BDSM relationship. There's no description of the very tame experiences other than \\"Holy [profanity] that hurts\\" and in book two you don't even get to that level as Christian has been 'reformed'. [another yawn].

B007SYWFRM|5.0|So much fun. Everyone who has a kindle in our house plays this! Love it!!!! Scrat short film is absolutely hilarious!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a very fun game&bull;i pod&bull;ipad&bull;phone 4s and meny other electronics. It is my favoroite game ever. for free. I love it
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Be aware this has an initial download that is relatively small then you're prompted to dowload the HUGE remainder of the game. I was skeptical, but my KF handled it well. Hope the devs do more just like this!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I, like so many other women, and a huge Sex and the City fan. But I've only been able to catch random episodes, and got tired of the cruddy quality of streaming them online. So I decided to splurge for the set, and I'm so happy that I did. The box set came in pristine condition, not a dent in a corner, or a scratch on the plastic wrap, it was absolutely perfect. It also came really fast in the mail as well, which I always appreciate. Highly recommended!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I liked this book but I didn't love. At some points in the book I would be like what just happened.It doesn't give you a very clear discription on everything. I think another reason I didn't like it as much as I could've is because I waited a year for this book and I'm gonna have to wait another YEAR for The House of Hades
0345803485|1.0|This INNER GODDESS is having trouble finishing Book ONE!  I will just bite my lower lip and close my Medium Gray Eyes and start paying closer attention to the the reviews.........Holy Crap - what an awful book!!  P.S. Amazon - now is the time to add ZERO stars to the ratings.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|its a fun game. You ride on a rollacoster.  very fun game.  &bull; Ipod &bull; I phone &bull;iphone 4 &bull; iphone4s &bull; ipad ans some other electronics
B003ASLJK4|5.0|The Bridges of Madison County is one of my favorite movies. I've seen it countless times. You can feel the love, the never ending connection, sadness and the true desires of unforbidden love and committment. I purchased this movie for a very special friend because I knew he could and would relate to it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I will keep this (fairly) short. One I am all for sex but this book and the other 3 literally have the same repetitive sex scene over and over (and seriously if this girl was a virgin she would be in a wheelchair by now or at least have a knarley UTI). Two I am the same age as Ana and she is so unrealistic, come on you are a 21 year old college student with a fun loving roommate best friend and you have never had any sort of encounter with a male let alone had any crazy college stories? Three the writing is pretty bad (do not even get me started on all the \\"inner goddess\\" BS) and by the second book you realize that the plot is so dull the author resolves problems to quickly and never really allows the suspense to build. To sum it up the story has good moments and is fairly romantic and sexy, but overall it just did not wow me and halfway through the second book I got fed up with all the sex, Ana's annoying behavior and the lack of plot and I decided to abandon the series
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is awesome to play. thought it looked lame but it is pretty entertaining. plus it is free so its always a perk :)
B0076XIS4O|4.0|Grimes is one of the best up and coming artists I have heard in a long time.  Although the whole album itself is okay, there are quite a few tracks on here that really kick a beat well.  I recommend Oblivion, Genesis and Skin.

B003YK42LQ|5.0|I've been a longtime Kings of Leon fan, and I'm disappointed when people say that they have sold out. When I first listened to them years ago, I knew that they eventually make it big, so it didn't come to much as a surprise when they finally did. I'll admit that I'm quite fond of their older stuff, but I love the new direction they're headed! This CD is practically flawless. My favorites are The End, Pyro, Mi Amigo, and Pickup Truck.
B006ZZCLV0|4.0|I thought the Hunger Games was compellingly told.  At least I felt compelled to read.[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]]  This was an EASY read ... lots of space, etc.<br /><br />I wasn't sure which book was \\"book number 1,\\" but was able to determine the order of the books without too much difficulty.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Carbon copy of Mario, but it definitely gets the job done. Easy to play on the Kindle Fire!!! Gets my five stars!
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Great movie, but one thing bothers me.  How did Cifer get into the Matrix in order to meet with the agents in secret?  Cifer has dinner with the agents and plots how he will betray the others and then have himself jacked back into the Matrix.<br /><br />How?<br /><br />In order to get in, you need to have a rod pushed into the back of your head.  In order to get out, someone has to unplug you.  Sooooo... how does this happen?  He can't get in and out by himself, but that is presumably what happens.  One minute he is having a drink with Neo, the next scene he is in the Matrix eating steak with an agent.<br /><br />Sorry - can't happen.  The only way it could happen would be if there was a conspiracy with another member of the crew.  There is not as far as we know.  So - can't happen.  Plot fail.<br /><br />Still 5 stars though.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is the greatest game sometimes the drawings are hard do hues but it is fun dealt fun you most get it!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I did not enjoy the trilogy! Very little about it to enjoy! However, it is so compelling, so well written, it was impossible to put it down! I do not recommend it to anyone who has anything  else to do in her/his life.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game. and I like that u put clips in it from the movie. they r really funny.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I ordered all three of these books, had to force my way thru first (disgusting and I am not a prude) kept hoping would get better. Started second, I am giving up my time is worth more thana reading this trash. These ctivities better kept in bedroom not adhered to paper!!!! Sad to think this woman is getting rich writing this!!!!!  My rating would be a minus.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|Went to order this book, and then I noticed the price.<br />I refuse to spend $16.99 for an ebook!!!! Ridiculous!!!<br />,
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|Great book took me some time to remember the details of the first book. I was taken back by the abrupt ending, but can't wait for the next book.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Angry Birds is OK and one of the better executed physics based games but it really isn't all that and a bag of chips that the hyper indicates. The scant storyline isn't worked in with the game and the levels all start to look like variations on the same theme after a while. If you miss your target and the bird doesn't destruct immediately, it takes forever to end the level. OK to play occasionally but too slow and samey to be truly engaging.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I never loved a game! Then I found draw something and fell in love!!! This is the best game in the universe!!!
B007LYB4BC|5.0|This is the format to hear this excellent album in. You can tell how much effort was put into making sure the packaging was perfect.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|keep getting marmalade error. lets me play for a Max of 30 minutes and then the error comes up. I just uninstall and then reinstall to keep playing,  but that gets very annoying. would get 5 stars if that was fixed. great game though!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I didn't want to get hooked to another TV show which is why I haven't watched Supernatural.... until now.  A friend told me I should try it out because it was better than anything else on TV and let me tell you, she was right. I am addicted. Each episode is like a mini-movie. I love Sam and Dean and how they play off of each other.  There are so many one liners and looks they give each other that have me laughing out loud. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are great together. I will be buying the seasons after this one and am sure I will be just as glued to them as I was to this one!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I gave this book two stars and I believe I was extremely generous. The only reason I picked up this book was because of all the hoopla. So many readers absolutely \\"loved\\" it, I just couldn't wait. Heck, I didn't even bother downloading the free sample on Kindle.  And that folks, was my first BIG MISTAKE!!  Ugh...what a disappointment. Although my reading tastes do not extend to the BDSM erotica, I figured with everyone gushing about it, there had to be more to the story...right???    Let's start about what I did like: I absolutely loved the email/text messages between Ana and Christian. They were very cleverly written. They were humorous and absolutely enjoyable for me. -Ok, that's about it then.    What I didn't like (pretty much everything else): Very repetitive. Christian is hot. Christian is so hot that Ana forgets all her morals, principles and the things that are important to her because he is so hot. He is so hot every female he encounters is overcome by his hotness. I get it. Really. I just don't need to hear about it in every other sentence in the book.    Also, I keep reading reviews about the comparisons between this story and Twilight's. Although the Twilight movies are pure torture for me and I could only tolerate watching the first one and not under the pain of torture and death will I watch the others ones, the books are relatively decent. There is no comparison in writing styles at all. And most importantly, in my opinion, at least Edward has an excuse for being traumatically odd. He is a freaking vampire after all.    Finally, the sex scenes: Again I will say my dislike for the book has no bearing whatsoever on its genre. I am definitely far from prude. The story itself didn't do it for me. I did skip over the sex scenes. They were boring and only made me yawn. I also I find Ana a weak female protagonist. And I am not going to even describe Christian. There. Are. No. Words. Just puke. I just didn't feel it.
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|For DVD/Blu-rays, I generally break down the review into the following categories.<br />** - I will not summarize the film or provide spoilers - **<br /><br />1. General Quality of the Film<br />2. Video Quality<br />3. Audio Quality<br />4. Special Features<br />5. Verdict<br /><br />1. General Quality of the Film<br />  You're reading this review because you are considering purchasing this product. This is my personal of the film; it is 100% subjective. In this case, the US version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was incredibly disappointing. Having read all of the Millennium books, and seen all of the extended Swedish films, I am somewhat biased because I have a baseline for comparison. Allow me to qualify further; I am a fan of David Fincher's work and I feel that he did a relatively decent job of preserving the main plot elements, but nevertheless I feel as though he failed to capture the captivating, immersive plot that has made this series an international sensation. The characters feel shallow and undeveloped, and the main characters failed to achieve the complex, visceral relationship that I feel is what makes this film and series great. Despite my criticisms, the film is worth watching *For Adults Only, as it contains graphic content including language, rape, and violence.<br /><br />2. Video Quality<br />  I saw this on Blu-ray, so I cannot comment on the DVD version. It is this area where this version of the film shines, and perhaps eclipses the Swedish films. In addition to superior visual effects, the colors are rich are the definition is excellent. Fincher, filming in the same locations and conditions as the original Swedish miniseries, managed to capture the scenery in a way that almost make it a character in its own. The Blu-ray transfer is top quality, and the copy that I viewed did not have any motion blur or artifact.<br /><br />3. Audio Quality<br />  Not typically a huge deal, but the 5.1 Digital Audio is superb. With a score composed by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, the audio comes through clear and the channels are well balanced so that dialogue is not drowned out by other elements of the film. I'm not going to go into great detail about the audio other than to say that it is excellent quality.<br /><br />4. Special Features<br />  This is the section that typically makes or breaks a sale for me. I'm admittedly a huge film nerd and love watching featurettes and listening to director/actor/crew commentary. The commentary by David Fincher is great, because he explains some subtle elements of the film that may not be obvious on first view. He also goes into detail into the making of the film and divulges some plot elements from the book that were left out of the final cut due to time. The Blu-ray version also contains several featurettes that are quite interesting, as well as some standard 'making-of' and deleted scenes.<br /><br />5. Verdict<br /> I know that I'm going to get a ton of flack for this, but I have to give The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a strong RENT. Despite the fact that it does not live up to the book or Swedish film, it is still a visually striking thrilling mystery that will likely only disappoint hardcore cine-ophiles like me.
0553801473|1.0|It is not that the book is bad per-say it is just full of frivolous side plots, useless ponderings, and pointless details. This would be tolerable if he published one of these a year, but he doesn't. The end effect is you wait five years for half a story that is 950 pages long. Every story line ended with a cliff hanger and no resolution was reached for anyone or anything. It was like he got tired of writing with 50 pages to go and said \\"f*** it, they can find out in the next book\\". I suppose we will now need to wait another five years to find out who lives and who dies (2 different characters), which army wins the battle (3 different armies), and if the lost characters return (1 character). For those of you keeping track at home that is 6 story lines that were left as cliff hangers.<br /><br />I genuinely liked this series, at first. But each book seems to get worse. Not that the plot is bad, or the characters aren't compelling, but to get to those gems you have to wade through pages and pages of drivel. Mr. Martin, please, I beg you, by the old gods and the new, hire a good editor and heed their advice.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. It's fun, funny, thoughtful, well cast, great screen play.<br />A genuine good movie for grown ups.  Not animated, not full of computer graphic cleverness, no gross gore.<br />Will probably purchase for personal library.  Highly recommend!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really loved this book and the series as a whole.  It actually took me a minute to like it.  I was focused on the domination side of things and anyone who knows me and my personality knows I would never go for that.  But once I realized the story wasn't just about that and more about these two people dealing with their issues in a new relationship as well as the outside forces, then I really started to like it.<br /><br />I read books for a living and call this series a palet cleanser.  When I read something that isn't very good and I don't want to pick up another book for fear that its going to be really bad, I start in where I left off on this series.  I actually skip over the sex.  My favorite parts are the email exchanges.  Then after a few chapters I'm ready to read something else again.<br /><br />This isn't the most well written book and it's a little juvenile in a lot of places, but it is easy reading almost like easy listening radio.  So, it works.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|I am still not completely sure how to use this machine, and I agree with the review about the micro-print instructions! But, whenever I thought the unit was not working, DBTech mailed me another unit.  Then, I found out that the unit just doesn't have its own speaker. DBTech sent me another unit to replace the 1st one, with no questions asked! I am mailing one unit back to them. Thanks, DB Tech.<br />Pam Sykes
0345803485|4.0|Child abuse happens in the lives of 1-5 boys.  As I read this book and see the plot (outside of all the sex) I get a feeling childhood abuse issues will surface.
0345525558|5.0|A wonderfully crafted piece of realistic fiction about neglect, desparation, hostility, unfairness, healing, hope and ultimately love; in other words, life. The author authentically develops the main character, Victoria, using a then vs. now style, intricately weaving a textured canvas of her past and present.<br /><br />Victoria, a victim of the foster care system since birth, is now faced with a non institutionalized existance upon being \\"emancipated\\", from the system, on her eighteenth birthday. With a limited skill-set and a mistrust of human beings, she is now to \\"make it\\" on her own and cope adaptively with society at large.<br /><br />Prior to reading this book, I was unaware of the historical piece of using flowers to communicate..flowers as a language. Therefore, in addition to reading a delicious novel, which I greedily devoured, I learned about an art. This book is both simultaneously harsh and sensitive. I highly recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|pretty good time waster. takes a lot of time to reach higher levels and achieve goals. simple and easy to play if you are patient.
B007AL48UK|5.0|Good game,  lots of fun.  Helps pass the time.  Very relaxing but helps keep you alert trying to find.<br />the match.
0345803485|1.0|Seriously, has no one seen the movie The Secretary (2002)?  This book has nearly the same plot.  The man in the movie is also Mr. Grey... coincidence?  I think not.<br /><br />This book is poorly written, and I would even say it is close to plagiarism on some accounts.  Take the movie The Secretary and parts of the Twilight books, add some asinine dialog and boring sex scenes and there you have it.  Complete garbage.
B006XBSAP2|4.0|I bought this a few days ago and I haven't stopped listening to it since.  I love the cd, the only single I wish they would put on there is 'Waking up in Vegas' Overall its a great cd and I'm very happy with my purchase even with the singles that aren't played on the radio.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Be careful of this product! My daughter got this FREE app that turned into not being very free!  When she was playing the game she thought she was purchasing items through the game, but was buying addition packs! (over 50 dollars worth)  I know she was old enough to know better (11) and we did have a long discussion, but I think this is nothing but a scam and I wish Amazon would take it off!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|game is great, I play it on my phone all the time a so I added it to my kindle. however, approximatly every week everythings glitches out. you will need to delete everything and start over,  or wait a week for things to reset. its a great game when it works, but with the glitches, don't wast your time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed reading this book. It was a similar read to the Twilight books, meaning I could not put it down and I lingered to every word. I anticipated reading the next book, which were equally great! I was excited to see the movie which came close to the book as well.
B004289ZW0|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2BMRPZI5FD5CZ]]The GNS 5870 works great as a GPS but I'm as frustrated by others by the finicky swipe switch so I decided to mount a regular switch even if the guarantee period is not over yet. The case is easily opened and there is enough room for a sub-miniature \\"rocker\\" switch at the side of the usb connector. I cut the black cable to the battery and soldered it to the bipolar two way switch. Then just made a hole in the side for the protruding part of the switch. It sticks out only 2,5 mm. It could have been even better to use a subminiature slide switch but I had the other at home.<br /><br />For some unknown reason the swipe doesn't work for me any more even if the internal battery is connected. Doesn't matter since I can easily jump start the device with any 5 volt source, such as a 5 volt Li-Ion power pack that I would bring anyhow for extra power. When power is applied, the unit starts. I then toggle the switch to bring in the battery and remove the external power unless I want to charge the GPS. It switches off directly by toggling the switch and there is no risk of it being activated inadvertenly. I can thus also operate it on an almost depleted external pack without the internal GPS battery drawing power fron the external source, causing voltage to drop.<br /><br />  [[ASIN:B004289ZW0 GNS 5870 MFI GPS BT Receiver for iPod, iPhone and iPad]]

B002AT4K9G|5.0|The Movie itself was great.  There was alot of drama and action packed scene's in it.  I alway enjoy the music they pick for the fast and furious movies, it always fits the movie's well and the scene's.  The girls are always hot, especially Mia(Jordana Brewster).  The storie line was ok, I think it could have been a little better.  And The car's, well the car's are always amazing.

1597801585|5.0|The Windup Girl had me pumped from the amount of online attention it had at its first release. I picked up my copy and was not disappointed. The setting, characters, and story were real and well fleshed out.<br /><br />The problem for this novel is that the writer was trying too hard at times to sound knowledgable. Also the multiple POV's made for a hard read sometimes. I would get confused on which character did what and how they looked.<br /><br />All this is forgiven however in the last two chapters--everything (EVERYTHING) ties back into the story. I can't wait to read more in the same universe.
1401307450|5.0|A very good book, filled with honesty, lessons learned and life. It's amazing what these guys have been through, and still continue to make great music. Everyone will see a piece of yourself, and or relate to the struggle in this book. Beautiful work Anthony.

B0074MZSWW|2.0|I had watched several videos of this band and was impressed with what I saw and heard. Picked up the Boys and Girls CD and was looking forward to enjoying it. Getting to the bottom line quickly - great band, great music, but this recording and production on the CD is really awful. Brittney's voice is harsh and fuzzy which makes the cd pretty much unlistenable to me.<br /><br />Really a shame, could have been so great, but  terrible production/recording quality ruined it.

I also like that I can still play even if I don't have an Internet connection, I have a lot of apps that cant be played without Internet and that is frustrating, thank you for making this app easier to play.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I too got this as part of the Kickstarter project - I have just started using it as Australia heads into winter and early darkness. I have been using Monkeylectric full-size Monkey lights for several years, so I know they make a quality product.<br /><br />Firstly, this is not a light you use to see where you are going. This is a light to be seen, to enhance you visibility on the roads.<br /><br />Most importantly, this light shines where other lights fail. Other lights will give great front or rear visibility, but almost always neglect the side visibility issue. A large percentage of car vs bicycle accidents at night are where a car did not see a bike from the side. These lights address that issue.<br /><br />Using these lights, you will have a unique light pattern on the road. Cars will either recognise the spinning circle pattern of lights as a bike, or not know what it is, but slow down anyway because they are so unusual.<br /><br />They are light weight, weatherproof, way-bright on both sides, and the number of different pattern to choose from or cycle thru is fun. Quality product - my full size Monkey Lights are now into there 4th year of use, with never a problem.<br /><br />Batteries last forever - I recharge just 2 or 3 times per season. That makes them even more useful because I don't have to worry about changing/recharging often. They are just there and ready to go anytime.<br /><br />Awesom saftey product that just happens to be super-cool as well. HIGHLY recommend.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|In winter I work from dark till dark as most people do. I've used the monkey light large for years now and received a lot of fun reactions from  them. So purchasing the new offering was a no brainer. I bought two of them. I have headlights and tail lights but I enjoy flying through a green light at intersections and putting on a show for the cars. I can\\"t add to the other reviews but I certainly do recommend this product

0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey should absolutely positively NOT to be judged by its c...(uh. um.) genre. If you do, you will miss out on one of the best series and the most endearing, interesting, polarizing, and passionate characters I've ever encountered. Having read many, many books, this is a profound promise.<br /><br />First, let me get my disclaimer out of the way lest anyone thinks I'm into reading or writing erotica. Fifty Shades of Grey is not a book I would have traditionally purchased (certainly am not recommending for young adults) because - like the rest of the world - I had stereotyped it. Erotica is a genre I don't read. I read (and write) paranormal and fantasy romance, and I'm pretty exclusive with them.<br /><br />Regardless of what you've read, heard, or assumed, you should always remember that this is a love story before it is anything else. Unfortunately, that very important point is overshadowed by the erotica and BDSM (I don't even know what that stands for and am afraid to look it up) categories prominently tagging the series.<br /><br />I was hooked and intrigued when I saw Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed knocked The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay out of the top three places on Amazon's top best list.<br /><br />As an author, I'm always curious about a book (series) powerful enough to blow past books like the Hunger Games Series and win the honors of the coveted best selling spots. With apprehension, I began my research and headed straight for the reviews. Most scathing. Others praising. The negative reviews were so passionate I knew the series had to have something within its covers to make these people feel strongly enough to take time to leave a review. Now, I know I was right. I was shocked repeatedly by this story line but never disappointed.<br /><br />I can without question relate with some of the reviewers' complaints. There were things in this book that made me uncomfortable. In fact, I told my husband I wished there was a 'clean' version of it. But, my agreement with the people demeaning this book/author stops right there. Ana and Christian's story requires details, and believe me, the sex scenes are not just there to be there. Each and every encounter had a well thought out and beautifully told purpose. They bond these characters in a way nothing else could. E.L. James is masterful at what she does, and I'm in awe.<br /><br />The ending of this book is such that I'm left saying 'What the heck?' and immediately downloading Fifty Shades Darker.<br /><br />T. R.

B00723NWJE|4.0|\\"Little Broken Hearts\\" is a nifty, attractive record that manages to be slinky-cool while also retaining resonance and warmth. Norah Jones and producer Brian Burton, known elsewhere as Danger Mouse, have created a slick, witty alt-rock concept album about the vagaries of falling out of love which also somehow manages to sound original, at least in overall presentation and feel. The results sound both legitimately avant-garde and ready to court the mainstream listener.<br /><br />Jones' supple, expressive voice and strong ear for melody make her thoughtful but ultimately unremarkable lyrics palatable, welcome and occasionally moving, but the true gift here is producer Burton, who understands his subject well enough to showcase her to the hilt. With his light-as-air touch and empathy for the emotional turmoil of her compositions, he gives them the boost they need to sound ingratiating, adding mystique, punch and flavor. The result is Jones' most consistently pleasing effort since 2004's \\"Feels Like Home.\\"<br /><br />This album is not one about individual songs but rather cohesion, aura and atmosphere - here, one of restraint and articulate, therapeutic calm under pressure. Little stand out from the crowd - the cheeky, intelligent, and instantly addictive \\"Happy Pills\\" is one exception, the hurts-so-good, ingenious \\"Say Goodbye\\" another - but that does not hinder the overall effect Jones and Burton reach for and achieve. The overall sound is strong, well-wrought and easy on the ears, clearly communicating Jones' swelling emotional turmoil without the need for the songs to call individual attention to themselves .<br /><br />By the time the icy, downbeat synths cloaking \\"After the Fall\\" sink in it becomes clear that Jones is not content to rest on her laurels, doggedly pursuing new paths and pursuits in her music. While this may be relatively easy for her to do - she has \\"Come Away With Me\\" money, after all - it is still admirable, considering she could have turned out half a dozen unadventurous cocktail jazz discs by now and still sold records in healthy numbers. Here, she proves she has substance to supplement her ambition. She is all the more intriguing and exciting for it, with Burton amplifying her already considerable assets, not only making her lyrics often sound far more consequential than they otherwise should but highlighting her versatility. This is nearly as much his album as hers, and Jones would surely agree.<br /><br />\\"Little Broken Hearts\\" is like a handful of Hershey's kisses. Their taste hardly rivals the nuance and boldness of what a top-shelf chocolatier would produce, but it is strangely impossible to avoid reaching back for more of them. Yes, they may be lacking for distinct personality or particularly revelation, but they are also sweet, satisfying and often comforting.half a dozen unadventurous cocktail jazz discs by now and still sold records in healthy numbers.

B00008QSA5|5.0|Super Sessions is a pretty unique album.  First of all I went into the album having very little experience with Mike Bloomfield despite numerous reviews convincing me of the genius and spectacular beauty of Bloomfield's guitar style.  Well guess what?  I DO love the mans style!  It takes a while to warm up to it however, and this is mainly because he plays at such an intense speed that there's hardly any time to catch your breath!  You need to hear it several times in a row to absorb and understand it!<br /><br />Now when I first heard \\"Albert's Shuffle\\" a thought occured to me... \\"MOVE over Eric Clapton!\\" because it sounds almost identical to some of Clapton's heavy blues stuff such as the live version of \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman?\\" from his EC Was Here live album.  It definitely falls under the same category of emotionally resonant blues, but regardless who influenced who (though I think Clapton beat him to the punch but I could be wrong, hehe) this song is downright amazing.  Amazing how the guitar solos build through several layers of emotions and THEN to add more excitement, a keyboard solo makes an appearance around the halfway point, and it's a highly melodic keyboard solo at that.  It's an interesting change of pace going from emotional guitar solos to melodic keyboard work.  Perhaps the light touch of jazz after the keyboard solo is a bit much, but then again, this IS 1968 and considering this is what I believe the beginning of the classic years of rock, it's quite a performance.  There's definitely nothing lacking or incomplete about this album overall, that's for sure.  \\"Really\\" falls under the same category- emotional guitar playing, melodic keyboard solos, jazzy tendencies, etc.  Another high point.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE \\"His Holy Modal Majesty\\".  In fact I actually first heard this song a few years ago on XM radio.  What caught my attention is the bass groove that can be heard during the first couple minutes, and... I had to do a google search to find THIS out, but the musical instrument jamming with the groove is something called an ondioline.  Don't even ASK me how to pronounce that, haha.  It's a high pitched instrument that's somewhere in between an early synthesizer and a keyboard.  Well whatever it is, it would probably irritate the pants off of me if it were to linger a few minutes longer BUT for just a couple minutes?  I can tolerate a couple minutes of a weird instrument!  Heck I can tolerate extreme pain for 2 minutes!  Well then again I've never been tortured.  Don't get any ideas!  :)<br /><br />Anyway, that bass groove is... WOW!  It makes \\"His Holy Modal Majesty\\" the best song on the album for me.  It reminds me of something kinky or rather, an Egyptian girl being kinky, hehe.  The rest of the song is occupied with fast-paced blues solos that are pretty melodic for the most part.<br /><br />\\"Season of the Witch\\" is the highlight for many people since it's the most familiar song here.  Well truth be told I never thought it was *that* great of a song- a slow-chugging, slightly ominous vocal melody that actually reminds me of Neil Young's \\"Down By The River\\" for some reason, and the jazziness we eventually experience is... eh, a bit much.  Not a bad song by any means, and this is by FAR the best version of it too.  11 minutes is just too much for my limited attention span I'm afraid!  Though it IS really melodic so at least it has that going for it.  \\"Stop\\" is based around really cool, melodic blues guitar and keyboard soloing.  Once again, the keyboard work strikes me as immediatley melodic whereas the guitar solos are a bit on the complex side so it takes time to search for the melodic lines.  It's awesome though.  \\"Harvey's Tune\\" is an atmospheric jazz instrumental.  I love it.<br /><br />\\"Man's Temptation\\" is a soulful tune with really beautiful and memorable vocals.  I love the creative inclusion of horns as well.  Yes there's hundreds of 60's songs that closely resemble this one in terms of atmosphere, arrangements and vocals but I don't care- I'll take them ALL!  \\"You Don't Love Me\\" is dominated with the ULTRA cool phase shifter effect.  You'll know what I mean when you hear it.  It sounds like you're in a spaceship and headed for Saturn!  I wonder if todays technology can recreate this particular sound?  I haven't heard this effect used in any music after the mid 70's.  It must have went out of style.  Anyway this is a blues/hard rock song similar to Robin Trower's early work, and it's awesome.  \\"It Takes a Lot To Laugh, It Takes a Train To Cry\\" reminds me of the mid 60's Byrds with a fast-paced, psychedelic part-country style.  Those feel good vibes are in high quantity here as well.<br /><br />Overall, it's super duper Super Sessions!  Pick it up for a solid taste of Mike Bloomfield, Stephen Stills and Al Kooper (though for me Bloomfield CLEARLY steals the spotlight).s of atmosphere, arrangements and vocals but I don't care- I'll take them ALL!  \\"You Don't Love Me\\" is dominated with the ULTRA cool phase shifter effect.

B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood has taken almost two and a half years between Blown Away and her very fine Play On album of 2009 and the break has paid off in spades.  While many successful singers get caught re-making the same style songs that brought them their initial fame, Carrie has chosen to broaden her creative horizon and sonic landscape with some of the most original and provocative songs of her career.  Producer Mark Bright is not afraid to paint outside the borders of country expectations with this masterfully crafted album.  I am sure some country purists will cry fowl for taking some of the music to a decidedly pop direction, but its a highly individual effort that Carrie herself was intimately involved with having written eight of the 14 songs on this exquisite album.<br /><br />Lets begin with the first song and single on the album, Good Girl, a country rocking co-write by the former American Idol Champion.  While this song might be the closest thing that one might expect as a follow-up to Before He Cheats or Cowboy Casanova, it really is a highly original number that changes both tempo and expectation as it takes you on its jaunty journey.<br />There is not another singer in the format that can rock n roll like Carrie and if you don't believe me, ask Steven Tyler who just got nominated for their duet together on CMT.<br /><br />The next song on the album is the title track, Blown Away, which should be seen as a watershed moment in country music history for both its current greatest vocalist as well as the genre itself.  This song is extremely bold in both its lyrical content, which deals with child abuse, and its amazingly creative sonic landscape which takes the listener on the childs ride through a storm in Oklahoma that might be able to sweep all her problems away. The use of instruments like piano and cello's to mimic the sounds of the winds and rain is breathtaking and Carrie's vocals are majestic.  Whether this song becomes the country-pop smash that it deserves is immaterial, this song is a masterpiece unlike anything thats come out of a nashville studio in many a year.  Whoa, and we are only two songs into the album and we are already dumbfounded by its majestic sweep.<br /><br />Then comes another highly ambitious story song co-written by Carrie Underwood, Hillary Lindsey and Before He Cheats writter Josh Kear. Two Black Cadillacs involves a murderous revenge theme plotted between wife and mistress and again is unlike anything on current country radio.  Its orchestral sweep and melodic counterpunch make this absolute ear candy for the musically inclined. What a rush. What a treat!  Are you listening at the Country Music Association?<br /><br />See You Again, written for the Chronicles Of Narnia originally, brings us out of the dark and back into the light with a churning country-pop ditty that could cross over as well as a single. Carries vocal is impeccable and spot-on.<br /><br />Don't You Think About Me...the way I think about you- is a gentle, but plaintive country song that would not be out of place on a Kelly Pickler album and Carrie does a fine job with this tender country weeper.<br /><br />Forever Changed, cowritten by The House That Built Me songwriter Tom Dougles is one of Carries personal favorites on the album. This piano based ballad tells the life cycle story of mother and daughter with a tenderness and sensitivity of phrasing by Carrie that really brings the listener closer to its protagonist.<br /><br />Nobody Ever Told You, another co-write by Carrie, is an uplifting and positive song aimed at a young culture thats become fixated on outside beauty and image.  Taylor Swift could have included this melodic anthem on her last album and it would not have seemed out of place.<br /><br />Carrie takes another real departure with One Way Ticket, a calypso flavored splendor that Kenny Chesney would have loved to have included on his next album.  What a treat to hear Carrie rhyme \\"lick it\\" with \\"ticket\\". Really nice vocals from Carrie that captures a lighter side of her personality.<br /><br />Thank God For Hometowns is a country gem that reminds all of us how quickly we want to leave our hometown when we are young and how quickly we try to find our way back as we grow a little wiser. Great song with tender and Compelling vocals by Carrie.<br /><br />Good In Goodbye is a song written by Carrie, Hillary Lindsey and One Republics Ryan Tedder, who co-wrote Rumor Has It with Adele and Turning Tables on her great album, 21.  You would expect a great song and you get one with this bittersweet song reminding us that sometimes its better that we don't always get what we wish for a la Garth Brooks Unanswered Prayers. Another great but nuanced vocal by Carrie that shows she has leaned that on some songs you hold back that powerful voice and show a fragile side instead.<br /><br />Leave Love Alone is one of the most country radio friendly songs on the album with its churning rhythem and sing-along chorus. You can't get this song out of your head once it has entered it.  Great, sassy vocals by Carrie that once again shows that nobody can sing an attitude song like Carrie.<br /><br />Cupids Got A Shotgun is an absolutely clever and upbeat country barnburner co-written by Carrie Herself.  Good friend Brad Paisley delivers some chicken-picken guitar that would make famed Elvis guitarist James Burton, who practically invented this style of playing, weep with envy or at least give a well earned shout-out to the talented Paisley.  Clever wordplay and another great song for country radio.  There are more single possibilities on here then you can shake a stick out.  One critic from U.S.A. Today estimates that there is a 2 year supply of singles on this album. I wholeheartedly concur with this prediction.<br /><br />Wine After Whiskey, which some critics said was meant for Carrie's Play On album, is perhaps one of her most sincere and straightforward country efforts to date. I was worried that this might be less than stellar since it was a left-over from Play On, but oh how wrong. It just probably did not fit the theme she wanted to convey on her previous album and is one of the best and most beautiful country songs she has ever had a hand in writing.<br /><br />Who Are You is a power ballad Christian Anthem written by Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange who was married to Shania Twain and Produced virtually all of Shania's hit records.  This incredibly majestic song is sung with such magnificent and transcendent beauty that some critics have mistakenly listed it as a love song as well.  This is probably due to the fact that many people are not use to hearing a Christian song sung so passionately and so powerfully.  I did not think there is another singer in the business that could sing the chorus of this song in the register that Carrie does with such flawless effort.  An amazing song that concludes one of the most ambitious country albums of the 21st Century.
B005ORVMT2|5.0|When it was first annouced that Rush would be updating their back catalog, I anxiously began saving up every penny in anticipation of these new sets, even though I thought the previous 1997 remasters sounded great overall. When they were finally released, I went for Sector 3 first only because it contained some of my personal favorite Rush albums and I was excited to hear what the new remastering had done for the albums. I was quite impressed with how much better they sounded to the previous remasters, each album was improved upon in some way or another. The only gripe that was later discoverd was different mixes of songs used for Hold Your Fire. This is true, and is still uncertain of why it was done. The only difference is some added synth here and there on some songs, not all of them, so overall it was not a glaring difference. The DVD-Audio of Signals was a great treat as well and very interesting to hardcore fans and audio enthusiasts alike. I soon after purchased Sector 2 and was met with the same conclusion of how much better the albums sounded. But, there again was yet another issue, this time with this set's DVD-Audio of A Farewell To Kings. By this time enough caring and devoted Rush fans had contacted Universal and Rush, and being the caring band they are acknowledged that there indeed was issues with the sets and that replacements were being made for AFTK's DVD-Audio and also the remastered CD of Fly By Night from this, Sector 1.<br /><br />Now that I finally obtained Sector 1 along with the replacement discs, after a good listening to the set, there are STILL apparent defects with this set. To start with the good, the Fly By Night issues have been cleared up by the replacement disc, and the album sounds fantastic, along with Caress of Stell, 2112, and All The World's A Stage. But on the self-titled Rush album, there is an apparent audio drop-out on 'What You're Doing' at 3:07. I even went back and listened to my '97 version to see if it was on it, but it wasn't. The rest of the set to my ears sounds just fine, and likewise with the other 2 sets, each albums' sound has improved dramatically. It just seems whoever was at quality control wasn't doing their job correctly to let such apparent mistakes be released to the public. I really do hate to have to gripe, especially after something has already been done to try to fix the problem. But this is just to help and warn fellow Rush-heads out there and to hopefully get this issue resolved so we can fully enjoy these incredible albums like we've never heard them before.t wasn't.

I will not attempt to analyze all of the elements that created the magic; as that has been done ad nauseum for the past 70 years. Suffice to say that Bogie is exceedingly cool in this, and the rest of the cast were just on point.<br /><br />****My Original Response****<br /><br />When I purchased this originally, I had the playback issue I mention here. It was the only disc that exhibited this problem, on my own setup. It killed me that this review was still up here; but I somehow feel wrong trying to pretend I never wrote it. So here it is. My apologies for having been wrong about the technical issues. Apparently is was my old Sony receiver or my old Samsung blu-ray player that just didn't want to play the sound on this.<br /><br />*******************<br /><br />I can't give The 70th Anniversary Casablanca Blu-Ray set very good marks at all. My initial shipment of this item was great as long as I was watching the extra features. The trouble started when I went to watch the film; there was no audio broadcasting, during the playback. I quickly reported the item as defective and Amazon promptly sent me a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement had the same issue. I'm running  a Samsung BD-6500 blu-ray player with all of the most recent updates. I'm not sure where the problem actually lies in this issue; but as I have no problems on playback with any other blu-ray I watch, I'm afraid there is a fault in the Warner Bros. production line. Hopefully I just hit a small, confined issue with this blu-ray as I would love to eventually own it; but until I hear that the issue has been dealt with, I can't be bothered with spending money on it right now.<br /><br />Is anyone else having issues with the audio playback?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I say strangely addictive because I usually read books that are written much better, and have a better storyline. I write for Siren (which is a publisher for these types of books), and my editor would have slammed this book back to EL James with so many red marks, repeatedly. I wish the book had been better written. Spelling mistakes, and grammar errors shouldn't make it past the first rewrite. I don't think EL James is too worried about it though. And apparently no one else is either.<br /><br />All of that being said...Somehow I couldn't put these books down. I read all 3 of them in 3 days, which is a record for me. These characters, Ana and Christian were addictive. I couldn't wait to see where they went next. I did have problems with Ana being so passive, and not standing up for herself better, but I just had to see what she was going to do next. I did not like the ending of the first book. Cliffhangers are just cruel! I HAD to buy the second book. There was no choice. I couldn't click on 'Buy It Now' fast enough.<br />All in all, I LOVED this trilogy. And if EL James comes out with any future books, I'll buy them too. And, if 50 Shades gets made into a movie, I'll be in line to buy tickets.

0345803485|2.0|Christian Grey is twenty seven years old, a self made billionaire (because we all know those guys are everywhere!) and apparently, the best looking man alive. Not only does he have all that going for him BUT he's also a classically trained pianist,helicopter pilot and just happens to be into S&M. Then there's Ana Steele. Twenty one years wise, just graduating from college, as pure as the driven snow and the most unique creature to ever walk the Earth. Men find themselves simply drawn to her, she has no clue why. There's just SOMETHING about her. Ater reading the entire book, I couldn't figure it out myself. Ana, for lack of a better term, has split personality disorder. No...not really. She does have an, \\"inner goddess,\\" and, \\"a conscience,\\" that are constantly talking to her. If Ana isn't rolling her eyes, prying her eyes off Christian or admiring for the millionth time his long graceful fingers, legs, neck etc., she's actively listening to and taking cues from her stupid inner voices. It's both childish and really annoying.<br />In truth, I found both characters and the whole story REALLY dull. After the first sex scene, you've pretty much covered all the other sex scenes. The author tosses in a riding crop here and some hand cuffs there but really...it's nothing new. As for the relationship...I ask, what relationship? They are sexually drawn to eachother. He's got issues and she's a simpleton...what kind of relationship were you hoping to find in that? It's like Twilight and Pretty Woman met up with a wilder version of Sex, Lies and Videotape and had this horrible love child.<br />So why two stars instead of one? It made me laugh. Sometimes, that's really all you can hope for once you've discovered you've invested in a turd.

B0055IU4GM|5.0|American songwriter/musician John Hiatt is back with his best album in years... 'Dirty Jeans And Mudslide Hymns', that will no doubt add to the recognition already given him by his peers for his songwriting. 'Dirty Jeans And Mudslide Hymns' produced by Kevin 'Caveman' Shirley delivers John Hiatt at the peak of his powers joined by the excellent Doug Lancio on lead guitar, Patrick O'Hearn on bass and Kenneth Blevins on drums. True class is permanent as you hear throughout this record, starting with the gritty 'Damn This Town' that gets you rockin' and straight in the groove with the tale of a troubled man rattled by each tragic twist of fate that affects his family. That sad feeling of love lost on 'Til I Get My Lovin' Back' gives way to a swinging love song for his wife of 25 years 'I Love That Girl'. National steel guitar & mandolin accompany his depression during 'All The Way Under' and the ballad 'Don't Wanna Leave You Now' is beautifully orchestrated. A rocking 'Detroit Made' recalls his love for driving his \\"deuce and a quarter\\" a.k.a. a Buick Electra, and a track never laid down from his early years 'Train To Birmingham' also warrants its inclusion here, not least for the slick slide guitar.<br /><br />Some of the greatest songs ever written were born out of adversity and 'Hold On For Your Love' & 'Down Around My Place' are no exception, telling of the flood that devastated much of Tennessee and surrounding states in May 2010. The infectious rhythm on 'Adios To California' bids farewell to his experiences on the West Coast, whilst a song about living through 9/11 'When New York Had Her Heart Broke' finally gets an airing to bring the curtain down on this outstanding album.<br /><br />John Hiatt continues to make great records and write memorable songs covered far and wide by artists like Bob Dylan (The Usual), BB King & Eric Clapton (Riding With The King), Buddy Guy (Feels Like Rain), Joe Cocker (Have A Little Faith In Me), David Crosby (Through Your Hands), Bonnie Raitt (Thing Called Love), Jeff Healey (Confidence Man), Emmylou Harris (Icy Blue Heart), Robben Ford (Real Man), Willie Nelson (The Most Unoriginal Sin), Iggy Pop (Something Wild), Joe Bonamassa (I Know A Place) etc...<br /><br />Amazing how so many people have John Hiatt songs in their music collection and yet still do not own one of his albums? A listen to 'Dirty Jeans And Mudslide Hymns' from this great American storyteller may change all that...onnie Raitt (Thing Called Love), Jeff Healey (Confidence Man), Emmylou Harris (Icy Blue Heart), Robben Ford (Real Man), Willie Nelson (The Most Unoriginal Sin), Iggy Pop (Something Wild), Joe Bonamassa (I Know A Place) etc...<br /><br />Amazing how so many people have John Hiatt songs in their music collection and yet still do not own one of his albums?

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|'The Walking Dead' is clearly one of the best TV programs to date. The series has only just finished showing in Australia on FX (a cable channel) and I am hooked. Normally I am not all that interested in zombie movies, but the well developed plot, engaging characters and suspense with the all menacing 'walkers' as a backdrop to the story has made me want to tune in over the past weeks to see what will happen to the group of survivors lead by ex-police officer Rick Grimes. I wait with baited anticipation for Season 3 which airs here is Australia this October 2012. If you haven't had a chance to see 'The Waliking Dead' grab yourself the DVDs, sit back and enjoy. You won't be disappointed. I wasn't.

I loved watching Christian work through his issues and rooted for the couple from the get go. Although the story is predictable for each book as far as the main outcome for Christian and Ana I really didn't mind. Warning This is a book with eek...  LOTS OF  SEX SCENES which people seem to love or hate in their literature so bear that in mind or just listen to your inner goddess and read a love story.

0307719219|2.0|Reading a book is not very dis-similar to a ROI (Return on Investment)analysis.  The time spent or the opportunity cost in terms of what I could otherwise be reading, being the investment.  Good book, but miserable ROI in my mind.  It is a 544 page book.  Tries to hone in on one single concept.  Very good candidate for Book Abstract.  The time spent reading every thing the author has to offer could be efficiently spent reading something else.  It goes on and on in history lessons one after another.  He started out with writing an Economic book, but if one read it without knowing which section in the book shop it was bought from or what the authors background was, one would think he is reading lessons in history with some economic arguments peppered along the way.  I conceded and gave up waiting for something to happen around 1/2 way along the book.  I don't like doing that, and can't say I have done that before.  But had to do it for this one.
B006Z7Z3R2|1.0|\\"You're just impatient! Ti West is a master at creating atmosphere! If you didn't like this movie, I'm sure Joel Schumacher will make a loud, angry horror movie one of these days! This is for TRUE fans of horror!\\"<br /><br />These are just a few of the retorts you hear from fans when you complain about West's slow-burn spookiness. I will grant, as others have done, that West does excellent work with a camera -- he frames and tracks some really sumptuous shots -- but atmosphere is no substitute for a story. I don't watch movies for atmosphere. That's why I buy lounge music, or candles, or fake cobwebs in October. If atmosphere is all a movie has going for it, then it's no better than one of those looped images of flickering fireplaces you can pop on the TV during Christmas.<br /><br />So what about the story? Isn't it scary? Nope. Two twenty-somethings -- Claire and Luke -- are the only staff members at the soon-to-close Yankee Pedlar Inn. With cheeky self-consciousness, they spend their many hours of free time searching the old hotel for one of the ghosts that is said to reside there. It's a fairly standard ghost story trope, and the addition of a psychic who has \\"reverse deja vu\\" does little to twist the story into something intriguing or new. There is, essentially, no story, which was a similar flaw in the nearly identical West film, The House of the Devil (girl left alone for a long time, strange goings-on, some people are not who they claim to be, incredibly slow atmospheric build to a cheap-show ten minute conclusion of sloppily written \\"chills\\").<br /><br />So the story sucks. Movies can still succeed by virtue of the characters alone, even if the plot is confusing or sloppy. Unfortunately, Luke and Claire, while well-acted and realistic enough, are not interesting characters. They speak with the kind of canned dialogue that screenwriters pen when they aren't sure what's supposed to happen next in the film. Sara Paxton tries desperately to make Claire appear as cute as she can in every scene; she looks like she took acting lessons from a newborn puppy. On the very, very few moments when the movie lets the viewers glimpse something creepy, the effect is numbed by Claire's mopey mugging.<br /><br />I'm certain it's meant to be funny, as it is often accompanied by hokey sitcom music. West seems to be as confused by comedy as he is by horror, though. The movie thinks things are funny -- a girl in her underwear runs by a small boy! it takes Claire five minutes to take out the trash! the coffee girl is socially awkward! -- but even if they were, they contribute nothing to the story or the characters. All in all, it's like watching two boring people making a movie about themselves being boring. Dull characters who are authentically acted are still dull.<br /><br />West obviously has an eye for making movies but not for telling stories. He tries too hard to be subtle and artistic. An excellent example is the final shot of the film. My friends did not understand why the camera held for so long on the final shot, but I saw what all of them missed. I won't tell you what it is, but I will say this: if you don't know it's there, it's almost impossible to see it. I only noticed the subtle little parting shot that West included in the scene because I read a review, like this one, telling me to look for it. And that's the thing: if your artistry is so subtle, so careful, so minute as to escape the notice of nearly every single viewer of your film, then maybe you're focused too much on the background stuff (like West's highly touted skill at creating atmosphere) and not enough on the actual meat of your movie (characters, story, conflict).<br /><br />Dialogue that treads water. Dull and annoying characters. Almost no story to speak of. Cliched plot. More than your average number of fake scares (I counted three before the first fifteen minutes).

B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|I like how Soderbergh will alternate between making big-budget popcorn flicks with low-budget experiments. It's nice to see a director trying to expand beyond his usual oeuvre, although that also means there's bound to be more than a few misfires. In fact, the last off-beat Soderbergh I saw that I liked was BUBBLE. The rest have been, well, good for him for trying is the point.<br /><br />Don't let the big names in HAYWIRE fool you. Everyone here -- Michael Douglas, Ewan MacGregor, Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton -- these people are the A-list powder sugar dusting on what is essentially Soderbergh filming Gina Carano beating people up for an hour and a half. If you don't know who Carano is, neither do I, and I didn't like this movie enough to look her up. I have heard that she was some kind of martial arts wunderkind, which is evident in the film. The fight choreography is a lot of fun without being cartoonish. There's also quite a bit of it.<br /><br />When Carano isn't fighting, she's trying very hard to convey emotions with what I have decided are paralytic good looks. I cannot tell if she chose to sublimate every one of her character's feelings under the same cold facade (if so, lazy and boring choice) or if she -- being new to film -- was afraid to look anything but her best in the movie, and so she always has the exact same sexy half-smirk in every scene. It's like the girl you know who does the duckface in every photo because she thinks its the only way she can take a good photo. Of course, maybe Carano just doesn't really know how to act, and the look on her face is muted confusion.<br /><br />The story might be partly to blame for that. Characters toss out vague references to being spies and such, and there's dozens of references to foreign places as if they were events. \\"Did he tell you about Barcelona? I'll never forget Dublin! Don't tell me you were behind Madrid!\\" The meat and potatoes of the plot work in the same overly general way. It's hard to understand much of what's going on, and when all is made (somewhat) clear, it turns out to be your basic spy-by-numbers plot. Even more disappointing than that is that the final revelations are made in true, clunky, B-movie style by having one character explain everything in a drawn-out monologue.<br /><br />The weirdest example of this happens near the very beginning, when Carano steals a man's car, but then politely tells him all about her jaded history as a private spy before crashing the car into Act Two. It's never fully explained why she sweetly reveals everything to this total stranger -- maybe he was supposed to go to the cops with his second-hand info from a wanted criminal? -- and when the topic is brushed over, it's dismissed without fanfare. Because who cares, right? Character actions and motivations be dammed! What people really want is Carano beating the snot out of Michael Fassbender for ten minutes.<br /><br />Well, I didn't want that. Soderbergh apparently did. If you do, too, then you might enjoy this film. If you're looking for someone to tell you a story with something other than their fists, though, you might want to look elsewherend much of what's going on, and when all is made (somewhat) clear, it turns out to be your basic spy-by-numbers plot.

B007HJ91HU|2.0|While I'm not opposed to remakes of teen classics, this one misses on several key marks, most notably a lack of acting chops in the main teen characters. The two leads come off as flat and are easily outshone by the supporting teen and adult actors (both very good). The main fault for this lies with the director, who seemed to be more concerned with the music selection (also good) than the acting or flow of the movie. Read one of his clunky interviews and you can see how he produces such a clunky movie.<br /><br />Although I support the idea of casting \\"unknowns\\", I think Zac Efron would have done much better in the role. Both leads look more like 30 year olds than teens, which is further emphasized by the more youthful supporting actors. What's more, the heroes are made slutty and mean and the \\"bad guys\\" are more sympathetic, creating a big ole mess for the audience. Partying, drinking and sex seem to be more of a daily lifestyle choice for these teens, rather than an occasional way to blow off steam. Perhaps this reflects the reality of today's culture, but it undermines the theme of the movie.<br /><br />The whole bit plays like the mocked up set piece that it is. You half expect to see 2x4s holding up the back of the buildings and I'd really like to know where in Georgia they grow enough cotton to operate a cotton gin for anything more than historical purposes. Gone is the fire and brimstone father of the original movie and in his place a benevolent but misguided Dennis Quaid with a Victoria's Secret model for a daughter. Black Americans are patronizingly presented as the friendly natives in much the same way they were in Mel Gibson's defeatist The Patriot.<br /><br />Throw in dancing that is more flailing and spinning than rhythmic and you wish you could not only have back that $1 from the rental but the time you spent watching. Your money is better spent on the soundtrack of this new Footloose rather than the movie itself.

I have purchased the next two books in this series and look forward to reading them.
0345803485|1.0|I am a lover of books.  I love to read and try to as often as possible.  I like many others, I'm sure, bought these books because it was compared to the Twilight books.  This book is so NOT a Twilight book.  Ok, I admit I didn't read the reviews of previous readers but I did read the blurb on the back of the books and some of the recommendations online.  At this moment in time I am a little over half way through the first book (I would be further along if I didn't have to stop and look up what half the \\"punishments\\" in this book are).  One thing I can tell you at this point is The Twilight Saga and The Fifty Shades Trilogy are nothing alike, they don't even belong in the same universe.  The Twilight Saga was a  Young Adults series, that had the added bonus of being appealing to adults.  Twilight had a virgin that waited until marriage, (4th book) to have sex (even though she was only 18) ...Fifty shades goes all of about two days.  The Fifty Shades Trilogy doesn't belong in the same house as anyone who would be considered a YOUNG ADULT.  I heard there was a romantic novel about a handsome, mysterious man and his deep dark secret.  I assumed secret agent, bounty hunter, vampire...not secret sex room!  This book is not my first romance novel.  I'll admit it I am a sucker for a good romance novel every now and again, but this book is SO NOT what I was looking for or wanted to find.  The difference between this novel and other romance novels is...THERE'S NO ROMANCE.  Most romance novels have a a romantic story line, some hardship or dilemma that has to be overcome for love to win, with a sprinkle, perhaps a dash of sex.  However, Fifty Shades reads more like a really graphic and detailed script to a really bad, low budget PORNO. I am not sure if I will bother finishing the first book or read the second and third, if the first 250 pages is an indication of whats in store I highly doubt I will finish it.<br /><br />I also have to point out that the books are deceptive inappearance.  The covers only add to the belief that they are similiar to the Twilight novels...look at the covers!! These covers are specifically designed to grab the attention of Twilight fans...I unfortunately bought into it.  After the first 100 pages I shut the book and examined the cover, and wow there is a warning \\"Exotic Romance/Mature Audience\\"...but it is unlikely that anyone purchasing these books would see this warning unless specifically looking for it. The only thing that is probably worse than the plot, content and dialogue of this book is that some YOUNG ADULT, a fan of Twilight or similiar book, will purchase this book and actually read it.

It is also written by an 'expert' in the field of deception detection, making some of his anecdotes interesting. But overall, this book is REPETITIVE, BORING, and HARD TO GET THROUGH.

B004LZRSBY|5.0|I like many people here in the U.S. missed out on a-ha for the last 25 years.  Hunting High and Low was the first album I ever bought, sadly, it took me until now to rediscover them.  This is definitely one of the top five concert blu-rays that I own.  The only one I would definitely put ahead of this is Queen Rock Montreal & Live Aid (that film is incredible in itself considering how long ago it was shot).  Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scott's is a great concert blu-ray, but comparing that to this concert is like comparing apples to oranges.  The performance here is stellar.  All the band members are at the peak of their game.  The sound mixing is excellent.  Stage setup and visuals at the concert are incredible.  Cinematography and visual mixing is excellent.  Can't give this enough stars.  Now I'm going back and buying all the albums that I missed out on!  Hopefully a-ha will see how much they are missed and somehow see to unretire at some point (30th anniverary tour?), and hopefully make one last visit to the U.S.A. for all the stupid people like me who missed out on them all these years...<br /><br />As an aside, when I first heard the song \\"We're Looking for the Whales\\", the song sounded so fresh, I thought it must have been from one of a-ha's last albums...I was shocked when I found out the song was on the album Scoundrel Days...a 26 year old album!!!<br /><br />I've also come to realize one of the factors in a-ha deciding to retire is that for someone Morten's age to continue singing all those impossible high notes...it just can't be done forever...

B007549W62|5.0|\\"The Divide\\" was supossed to be horror, or it was marketed as such, but more suspense/drama.  The actors/actresses really impressed me with what they had to work with.<br />It starts literally with the apocolypse and your general group of survivors including the super of the apartment complex Michael Biehn all racing down the stairs to take cover in the basement of their apartment building. There are so many different personalities and this movie really gets down to the nitty gritty of how they felt and the madness that creeps up on them in many forms...from torture, to violence, and very disturbing sex scenes with Rosanna Arquette as the woman being used by several of the men.  I was totally hooked from the start and its a movie that you either love it or hate it, I loved it.  Its worth a rent.

However, this same film was No.1 across Europe for 2-3 weeks, breaking box office records in several countries, so the European marketing team certainly knew what draws people into theaters (and it is not posters of white apes and silhouetted Tharks of all things)! People want to see the winsome Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) and the handsome hero, Taylor Kitsch (the incorrigibly charming \\"Gambit\\" from \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\").<br /><br />There's no denying that Taylor Kitsch is THE action star of the year, what with three starring film roles in the first half of 2012. There's also no debate that \\"John Carter\\" has more heart, excitement, action and thrills than any other adventure film in many years. I've seen this film 38 times in the cinema (yep!) during the theatrical release and I couldn't wait to have it to watch any time I please. All of the performances are fabulous, from our world-weary yet bound-by-honor ex-Cavalryman (Kitsch) who is transported to the world of 1863 Mars (locals call it \\"Barsoom\\"), to the merciless plunderer, Sab Than (Dominic West), to the villainous mystic, Matai Shang (Mark Strong). There's also Lynn Collins as the most intelligent, valiant and lovely Disney princess of all, Dejah Thoris, a worthy Princess Of Mars, and the clever and dashing Kantos Kan, played by James Purefoy. Willem Dafoe is wonderfully warm as the Tharks' Jeddak (ruler) Tars Tarkas, played in perfect opposition to the cold and ruthless Tal Hajus (Thomas Haden-Church); this tandem is matched on the feminine side by the pure-hearted Sola (Samantha Morton) plagued by her evil nemesis Sarkoja (Polly Walker). And then there's everyone's favorite lizard-meets-dog, the playful Woola, who lavishes his protection (and slobbering) on his beloved John Carter.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating is mainly for a brief scene of torture which might upset small children, but while it might be unsettling, it is handled quickly and is there solely to advance the subplot. There is a very minor amount of cursing (nothing by comparison to most films these days) and, for any squeamish boys in your home, very little of the mushy stuff. \\"John Carter\\" is truly a most perfect action/adventure film for the entire family, beautifully translated from the novel of 100 years ago. Here's hoping for a couple of sequels because viewers will want to travel back to Barsoom along with Captain John Carter again and again.

0345803485|2.0|Holy Crap I´m \\"biting my lip\\" it´s repetitive and I can´t add much more to what the other negative reviewers have already said.  The girl seems more like 15 than 21 considering how naive she is.  Graduating from university and she´s \\"never held hands\\", \\"only been kissed once or twice\\", \\"has never masturbated\\" and \\"is incredibly worried because she´s never stayed out all night before and what´s her roommate going to think\\".....come on, who is going to believe this?  I mean even the girls who go to Bob Jones Jesus University have more sexual prowess than the soon to be BDSM slave of this book.  All that being said, and despite the poor writing, I did somehow manage to finish it and if it brings out the \\"inner goddess\\" in more women out there that can´t be bad news for us guys....so two stars..

1451627289|5.0|Absolutely King's best!!!! Be ready to use your imagination!  I haven't picked up one of his books in quite a while and glad I did. From page one till page 842, I couldn't get enough. I have always been intrigued by the JFK assassination, but this novel is off the charts! One afternoon I read almost 300 pages of this bad boy and wish I could have read more. King has a way of grabbing the reader and holding on. I didn't want this story to end, but end it did and it was awesome. The last chapter was totally unexpected. I had a lot of thoughts of how this story was going to end as I read on and none what happened is what I expected. This is one King book you need to pick up, especially if you grew up in the late 50's and early 60's. The cars, the music, the styles, the simple life.<br />Next on the docket, Under the Dome. Thanks, Mr. King

I highly recommend reading it for anyone who wants to learn more about the way the economy works.

0062082353|4.0|\\"American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History\\" by Navy SEAL Chris Kyle with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice is an engaging account of Chris Kyle's time as a Navy SEAL, where he became a SEAL sniper and amassed an amazing amount of confirmed kills, and who knows how many probables.  Having been an Army sniper, and having known a number of Vietnam era and more recent snipers, I understand what goes into confirmed kills, and that is why I state that Kyle amassed an amazing number of them.<br /><br />There are many reviews of this book, both good and bad.  I agree, as a shooter, that I'd have liked a little more description and focus on some of the actual sniping.  Yes, I wanted a few more details.  However, what I really liked is that the book allows you to get to know Kyle a bit, as a person, not a cold calculating killing machine that some might think a SEAL sniper is.<br /><br />Obviously, when it comes to a sniper with the confirmed kills that Kyle has, comparisons to Carlos Hathcock, the famed Marine sniper from Vietnam will be made.  I knew Hathcock, and have fond memories of our conversations and exchanges through the mail.  I was very pleased to see Kyle honor him in the pages of this book.  According to Kyle, \\"he was and always will be the greatest sniper ever.\\"<br /><br />Some might not have liked the passages written by Kyle's wife, Taya, but I found them to add some of the personality of the book.  The fact is, when people in the military are deployed, there are those at home who are impacted.  It was good to see this, and how the relationship was effected by Kyle's deployments and his feelings toward country and family, and how those feelings matured and why he finally got out of the military and devoted time to his family.  (Even if he did feel some guilt over this.)<br /><br />I was working security the other night and couldn't help but think of Kyle when a number of people didn't stop walking around the stadium when the National Anthem was playing.  I liked Kyle's passage about speaking up to people like that, and I myself have done the same.  It was these little things that made my like Kyle more, and that added to the book.<br /><br />This is not an action packed account of sniper missions, but rather a mildly sanitized account of one man's (and his wife's) story of become a Navy SEAL sniper and what that journey encompassed, and how it effected him, and where he went next.  I enjoyed reading his story, and I feel I'd enjoy getting to know Chris Kyle.  I'd have liked to have had more detail on certain sniping missions and tactics, and I can understand how some people might not like this straight forward attitude on things.  I'm glad I read this book, but I give it four stars when compared to Hatchcock's story's five.  I thank Chris Kyle for his service, and I thank him for sharing his tale.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the Ben Baker sniper novel Lost Conscience to be released in 2012.n the National Anthem was playing.

B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Hello, this chip was for an HP multi-function printer. You really need the extra memory so that print jobs leave your pc and are accepted by the printer memory. Otherwise, big jobs (usually with lots of graphics in color) can hold up your processor while the printer formats each page with the memory it has.<br /><br />HP charges $599 for the 256 Mb chip while Kingston (thru Amazon) sells it for about $11.00. This is like the hospital charging $5.00 for an aspirin -- because they can. My machine runs fine. By the way, the HP printer only costs about $650. In the last 25 years I have never purchased extra printer memory from HP - always from a third party and have never had a problem. Hp might tell you that their warranty is no valid with external parts, but that is bogus...dm

B001HNE3NO|5.0|I loved this book! It was well written and a page turner. The storyline does go back in forth from past to present and that's what kept me wanting to keep reading. The ending was really good too. It is a sad plotline because it does talk a lot about what happened to the Jews. Overall-- a great book that I would recommend!

0307592731|5.0|This is a book of loss and redemption, about the 'Pilgrim's way' as the Swiss woman who massages Cheryl's feet, about a holy pilgrimage as the stranger who gives her a \\"sacred\\" Rastafarian T-shirt emblazoned with Marley's portrait. Her end point is the \\"Bridge of Gods\\"--an actual place, so please travel with her as she weaves past and present; inner life and the hard and unrelenting physicality of lugging a heavy pack through the woods. For the record, it is not about hiking, wilderness adventure, how to pack correctly, or what to take with you on the Pacific Crest trail.<br /><br />The apparent artlessness of the story-telling should not lull the reader; it is as carefully crafted as a writer's art can make it. Literal it is not--although I'm sure the journal she kept was invaluable when it came time to write this.<br /><br />There are passages that reduced me to tears (like the NYTimes reviewer, and like him I like to think of myself as a tough nut); there are sentences that are as fine as anyone has managed to get down on paper.<br /><br />Simply a wonderful book and a sterling example of why memoir which has been 'done' still has legs.
0307592731|5.0|A few weeks ago I was skiing with my brother and his family at Mount Bachelor when he mentioned that he was in a book about the PCT. He completed the thru hike the year Cheryl hiked portions of it and appears as Josh one of three \\"young bucks.\\"  I enjoyed the first piece Strayed's writing I read years ago, a raucous and raunchy essay that appeared in America's Best Essays. \\"Wild,\\" my second Strayed read, is an emotionally raw and honest book.  It is more of catharsis and a rebirth than an adventure book.  The process of completing a long hike is simply putting one foot after the other. Almost anyone can do it.  That alone is not so sexy, interesting, or even adventurous to make a book I would want to read.  So I am thankful that Cheryl shared what was going on in her thoughts and part of her history in a self effacing manner. I especially enjoyed her discussion of songs stuck in her head because my brother had \\"Poisoning the Pigeons in the park\\" by Tom Lehrer stuck in his head for three full days on the trail and I can still, at 39, get him into a fighting mood by humming a few verses.  Also growing up in a backpacking family I could relate to all of the fantasies about food.  The moving and mixed way Cheryl writes about her mother will make you want to call your mom and tell her that you love her. I am giving this book to my office landlady and I think it will be book club fodder in Albany, Ca. If you're not in touch with your emotions, are judgmental about sexuality or drugs, or do not like to hear about how other's work out difficult life issues, then this is not the book for you.  If you're a puritan and righteous indignation is your thing you will love this book.  But if you have struggled, lived as a deviant in order to process life, or just like to read some interesting perspectives on life this book well worth reading.

B0000028UK|5.0|It's overall heavier and less radio friendly than Ten. It has a lot more diversity and ranges from hard rock and metal like \\"Blood\\" to folk/acoustic ballads like \\"Elderly Woman behind the Counter In A Small Town\\" which you're probably familiar with. It covers more ground and has a better variety. Animal, Dissident, Rats and Rearviewmirror are also some of my favorites but the whole CD's good and there's absolutely no filler. Although Ten is also a very consistent album and more popular, VS is just as good.
0749942169|2.0|I enjoyed Sister but thought this smacked of a barely thought through speed to market follow up book - an interesting conceit but great swathes of tedious comings and goings between a fairly two dimensional and implausible bunch of characters.  The mother/teenage daughter relationship didnt ring true at all and the narrator's self contained middle class mommy world held little appeal.<br />Judicious pruning from the editor would have helped a lot - I forced myself on to find out whodunnit but ultimately the characters' motivations were all too thin.

B0052GACNM|5.0|If you're a Tony Bennett Fan, regardless what's said about this sequel follow-up to his extremely popular \\"Duets\\" CD from 2006, you're gonna still get this \\"Duets 2\\" no matter what.  But for a non-diehard fan like myself, I was surprised upon hearing the performances how truly wonderful most of them are.  To my naked ears, Tony's vocals are stronger than his performance on the \\"Duets\\" CD. Perhaps due to his comfort level and familiarity with the songs and his partners, he truly excels in this setting the second time around.<br /><br />There are some stellar performances here, for sure.  You cannot mention this \\"Duets 2\\" CD without first mentioning the talented (and very misunderstood) Amy Winehouse, someone who could've left an indelible mark on the jazz world had she been around long enough to tackle it.  Her performance with Tony on the jazz classic \\"Body and Soul\\" is a stunning, stellar performance.  It is perhaps the most haunting track on this entire CD, the one performance that will stay with you for hours after the disc has stopped playing.<br /><br />Winehouse's \\"Billie Holiday on Acid\\" vocals and interpretative abilities are second to none.  She knows when to insert her distinctive personality on the material and when to pull back and stay true to the melody (just like Billie Holiday).  It is a performance that won her and Tony the 2012 Grammy Award for \\"Best Duo or Vocal Pop Performance\\".  Truly the one track I keep hitting \\"repeat\\" on my CD player.  It's THAT good!<br /><br />There are more great surprises -- Queen Latifah sounds like she was BORN to sing this material (of course she has already put out 2 CD's full of this type of stuff), so she knows her stuff!  She sounds appropriately tender and sentimental on \\"Who Can I Turn To\\", one of Tony's biggest hits from the 1960's.  Her voice is as smooth as molasses.  Keep pumping out this stuff, Queen L., you're great at it!<br /><br />Faith Hill and Norah Jones are another two standout performers in \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" and \\"Speak Low\\", respectively.  Faith shows she knows more than country music with her take and her performance is exquisite!  Norah's voice dips to the lower register, sounding like a sexy vixen (very appropriate) to match the lyrics in \\"Speak Low\\".  Norah is one helluva performer, she knows the material and can adjust her voice, key, tempo, and mood to match the song.  This is one smart kitten!<br /><br />Now some of the ones that didn't quite work out.  Mariah Carey sounds misplaced here in her duet \\"When Do Bells Ring For Me\\", her voice hitting the higher registers which sounds completely out of line with Tony's burnished lower key.  Their duet sounds like they recorded their vocals separately.  It lacks the chemistry and sexiness that Tony generates with his other female duet partners.  \\"The Queen\\" as in Aretha Franklin, is another wasted opportunity.  Aretha totally oversings her part in \\"How Do You Keep the Music Playing\\".  Again, it lacks the chemistry and focus, a total waste of a rare opportunity pairing two irreplaceable vocalists.<br /><br />More lame performances follow in John Mayer's whining \\"One For My Baby\\".  The whining quality really totally dominates his performance and the poor guy sounds like he's totally lost and out of his element with this material.  A good choice for other performers to choose duet partners would be to AVOID John Mayer at all costs.  He totally drags the CD down!<br /><br />Alejandro Sanz is the lone performer who makes a return appearance from the first \\"Duets\\" CD.  As to why Tony chose Sanz to return for a repeat performance is beyond me.  His poor English and grinding voice totally wastes the material.  Anyone who has heard Sanz try to speak English will understand why he wastes this song.  Both Sanz and Mayer are the two biggest losers on this CD.  Please do not choose them for any repeat performances.  They should stick to recording their own CD's.<br /><br />Other than that, the overall quality on\\"Duets 2\\" is a good one and definitely a \\"Buy\\" for Bennett fans and non-fans alike.  Though not quite \\"Five Star\\" quality, it still easily rates \\"Four and a Half\\" stars.
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|This movie is solely about the talents on Meryl Streep.  Although I am not as critical of the movie as a whole as many of you have been, I found her performance to be simply incredible and well worth her third (and long overdue)Oscar.  Now maybe she can focus on the overall quality of the films she chooses to work on and not just about her performance.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I've been with a Rebecca Brandon since she was known as Rebecca Bloomwood.  I never thought I could meet another character that engrossed me like Rebecca with her antics.  That is until I read pages filled with Ms. Poppy Wyatt.  Poppy has definitely given Rebecca a run for her money.<br /><br />From the first 2 chapters, I was beyond hooked.  I had too many laugh out loud moments that I received stares.  Who knew an engagement ring and phone could lead to all that?  But it is hilarious seeing how everything turns out.<br /><br />I held off for a little over 2 months from spending the full price for the book.  Can I admit I was wrong?  This book is worth EVERY penny.  I'm hoping that I do get the opportunity to read a \\"sequel\\", another sequel, and etcetera, etcetera, and etcetera.  (I got a feeling.)<br /><br />I also like the footnotes.
0393088774|5.0|The Great Recession that began in 2007 is now over four years old, and counting. About 24 million Americans are now unemployed or underemployed, and at recent job creation rates we can't be back to normal employment levels until late this decade. Regardless, the way forward is clear - faster growth levels must be our priority. Krugman's objective for the book is to break the hold of destructive conventional wisdom (austerity, balanced budgets during a down cycle).<br /><br />Officially the Great Recession that began 12/07 ended 6/09 - but this has helped the average American little, and citizens in some European nations are doing worse. Research tells us that money isn't that important once you can afford life's necessities. People who want to find work and can't, however, suffer greatly from both the loss of income and a diminished sense of self-worth. Some contend the unemployed are simply 'spoiled,' choosing unemployment benefits instead of work. Krugman's rejoinder - those who tell us this rarely have jobs to offer and don't know of any. They're simply demonstrating how little they know of the world. (Eg. People at the Chicago Board of Trade in 10/11 mocked demonstrators by showering them with McDonald's application forms. Turns out that McDonald's had announced 50,000 new jobs back in 4/11, and about 1 million had already applied.)<br /><br />A 6/11 poll of likely voters found almost 40% of families had suffered from reduced hours, wages, or benefits. Six million Americans, almost 5X that number in 2007, have been out of work for 6 months or more, 4 million for over a year - up from 700,000 prior to the Great Recession. Not since the 1930s have so many found themselves seemingly trapped. The newly educated haven't escaped either - recent reports tell us that about half of new college graduates became unemployed or underemployed upon graduation; many end up living with their parents. Manufacturing capacity has fallen about 5% since the start of the Great Recession. Public investment has fallen sharply, adjusted for inflation. Hitler was brought to power by the German depression of the early 1930s; there's been a clear rise in extremist politics across the Western world.<br /><br />None of this needed to happen - we've learned what to do since the Great Depression, but self-interest and distorted ideology have prevented taking appropriate action. If we have mass unemployment because too many workers lack the right skills (as some claim now, as they also did in the 1930s), we should be able to find a significant number of workers with those skills, and prospering. But we can't. In 1937 the economy suffered a second severe recession, yet the economy was booming in 1939. Why - government war spending. It's that simple.on.

B000VSAEYI|3.0|I bought this pool for my 2 year old son. It looked perfect for him. He was so excited when he saw the box. We got the pool out to blow it up and started with the smaller pieces that came with it (the turtle, whale and ring toss). One of the ring toss pieces had a huge hole right on the lining of it. We were a little bummed but figured there were 2 other ones just like it so why let it bother us? Then as we are blowing up the pool we found another hole at the bottom of the slide! It definitely sucked to know we hadn't even used it yet and already found 2 holes. We were able to use the pool anyway being that the 2nd hole was in the small section at the bottom of the slide that is there for the kids to land on after they slide. It's there for cushion but not necessary to have. My son absolutely loved this pool and played in it for hours. The holes sucked but thankfully they were not in any major areas of the pool.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|LOVE IT!  It's like taking many bibles w u wherever u take your kindle or smartphone! You can view different translations which is a big study help. I love that I can hilight & make notes just as I do in my regular Bible. The best part is bn able to easily find your notes instead of flipping pages trying to remember where u wrote it. I'd recommend this app to anyone on the go but gotta have their Word w them at all times. Great app!

B004HD61KE|5.0|Now, admittedly, I devour thrillers with a technical or historical bent with an ease that sometimes astounds me. I was a little concerned about Rollins setting his latest Sigma novel mostly in the States, but I needn't have worried.<br /><br />From the shocking murders in the opening pages, to the terrorist who wasn't, a villain who fascinated me and acknowledged his weaknesses, and rollicking adventure, taking the reader across the States, into Japan and Iceland briefly, examining Mormon and Native American themes, and tying in a potential worldwide disaster with nanotechnology.<br /><br />Throughout, Rollin's Sigma Force characters anchor the story. He seamlessly moves the characters we've grown to love through new experiences, giving enough of the familiar to ground the reader. Gray's father's worsening health is a theme we've seen before, but Painter as an \\"Uncle\\" figure is new.<br /><br />James Rollins writes women incredibly well and I firmly admit to loving Seichan. The changes we've seen in her, and the way he moderates her connection with Gray, is a delight.<br /><br />And Rollin excels at what he does been--characters the readers love facing man-made and technological dangers.<br /><br />Nobody does it better than James Rollins!

B0042J6VUS|5.0|This is a great little tripod for the iPhone, or any smartphone.  It holds the iPhone (what I have) very securely/tight.  The little tripod legs are a bit light, but it gets the job done, overall.<br /><br />A great deal for a few bucks...maybe $4.00 or $5.00?!  Definitely worth it if you CAN NOT stand holding up your iPhone with books or whatever while you film.  We're not talking about some high end expensive tripod here.  Just your basic simple tripod.  I recommend!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Those familiar with the book, [[ASIN:0060746394 Nine and a Half Weeks: A Memoir of a Love Affair]] will probably be disappointed. Ana and Christian are younger and less mature (agewise, emotionally and sexually) than the couple in 9-1/2. Fifty Shades is not shocking, though I think some people will be \\"shocked\\". \\"Fifty Shades\\" is to Generation Y what \\"Forever\\" (by Judy Blume) was to Generation X when we were in Junior HS. After the smoke clears, people will wonder \\"what the hype was that all about?\\". The ending of \\"Fifty\\" was definitely expected and rather \\"store-brand vanilla icecream.\\" At 100%, I was thinking \\"What? That's it?\\". If I had been reading a paper book, I would have flipped the back cover over to make sure I wasn't missing something else.
B007Q2N0HA|3.0|I purchased this book based on reviews that it's better than Fifty. Well, it is not. This book has intensity and dark secrets that will need to be revealed, but the main characters do not have the same all consuming passion or intensity as Christian and Anna. I don't like how this book ended, it seems that it just cut off without a conclusion  or a well developed set up for the next book. I am however, intrigued and will probably purchase the 2nd book just to<br />see how things will unfold.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|OK..it's no classic, but I gotta say, I liked it .  (i'm 40ish and enjoyed the Twlilght series also..call me immature..) I have read all three books, and found them entertaining and somewhat addicting. If you are looking for deep literature, this is not the book for you, but if you enjoy a raunchy romance with some messed up personalities, these are shockingly fun books (with kinda stupid plot twists at times). Summer's coming and these are great beach reads (just make sure your kids are not reading over your shoulder!)

B002VECM4A|1.0|I was a public health nurse. Yes, in fact, people do live this way, surprise surprise. Unfortunately this film inspires more racism than sympathy, my opinion only. I am not sure what the purpose of this movie was, but it was not entertaining. Also,too melodramatic, as others have said.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I picked up this novel as a recommendation from a Goodreads forum for \\"New Adult\\" fiction. \\"New Adult\\"--or \\"Upper-YA\\"--involves characters in their early twenties, in college, their first job, or first serious relationship etc... Jamie McGuire classified the novel as 'Contemporary Romance', not YA (due to the language and sexual content).<br /><br />I might start with what I liked `less' (emphasis below on 'IMHO', standing for 'In My Humble Opinion').<br /><br />The quality of the writing was slightly inconsistent (IMHO), and I also agree with another reviewer: the dialogue wasn't maybe as sharply or, at other times, as smoothly drawn as I would have expected from such a successful book.<br /><br />The ending was hasty and a bit corny, and would benefit from a rewrite (again IMHO).<br /><br />Finally the plot became repetitive in the second half of the book, with the on/off-relationship between Abby and Travis moving into roller-coasting mode. As always, IMHO.<br /><br />Now, what did I like?<br /><br />Travis... He is SO NOT the clean-shaven, preppy hero you have come to expect from YA fictions (or make it adult romance, as well... ). There's something so rough and edgy about him, you can't helped being intrigued. Jamie McGuire took a risk with such a hero. He could easily be not likeable at all. And yet, she managed to make him the most appealing character in the book. That, in itself, is a huge achievement.<br /><br />I read other reviewers said that the relationship was abusive. I won't go that far, but it is certainly kind of unhealthy. Again, I respect the author for exploring that angle because it makes Abby and Travis' love story more realistic than most. I'm not saying that a relationship has to be unhealthy to be real. But, come on, it often happens, especially at that age. Travis and Abby have left their homes, their families, the past that has defined them so far... and they're now looking for themselves. In the process, they find each other. But in building their relationship, they're also building themselves. Follows a story of trials and errors.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster may be an uncomfortable read at times, but it's definitely worth giving it a chance. I'm looking forward to reading the story told from Travis' point-of-view. So check Jamie's website for the latest news ;-)ding their relationship, they're also building themselves.

0345803485|1.0|My boyfriend and I laughed while reading this out loud to each other at night in bed. The author's language style was distracting (,e.g., \\"crapola,\\"). I hardly ever read fiction--much less erotic romance--and I was excited to read this, but I have to say that this is a very poorly written book. The ending was not satisfying in the least; what did the reader learn? What was gained? What was the point? The sex scenes were drab and predictable. Grey was not appealing to me at all. The author's incessant nagging about his appearance really pointed out the superficiality of the whole book. I still fail to see how a man like Grey could have any desire for somebody like Ana...The dialogue was trite and immature most of the time. One thing I hate is cuss words during a sex scene, but that's just me. Her friend Kate had no appeal either. All in all, I really think that this book is one of the worst I've read. I only finished it because I thought there might be a good ending, but it ended as dull as it began. I will not be reading the sequels.

B007JWKLMO|5.0|Following on from his outstanding 2005 documentary of Bob Dylan's early career `No Direction Home' and his excellent series on the blues, Martin Scorsese again proves himself to be a master of the craft of in-depth bio-pic documentary film-making with this glorious, colourful, warts-and-all portrait of George Harrison.<br /><br />The film is available either on two separate DVDs with the Beatles break-up as the divider, or as one single uninterrupted DVD - if you can take a three-and-a-half hour film in one sitting. Despite its 210-minute running time it never drags and holds the viewer's attention throughout.<br /><br />The format is a roughly chronological narrative which follows Scorsese's usual `fly-on-the-wall' style of no-voiceover-commentary, allowing for the interviewees - Paul McCartney, Ringo, Eric Clapton, Phil Spector, Jackie Stewart, Klaus Voorman, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Olivia and Dhani Harrison and George himself (not a complete list by any means) - to do the talking. The memories are poignant, honest, heartfelt and engaging, offering a mostly sympathetic portrait of this most introspective of Beatles juxtaposed with archive footage and stills from George's long career, plus some live concert and studio sessions.<br /><br />Some of the most arresting moments explore George's rejection of the trappings of fame, lack of interest in awards and quest for deeper self-knowledge and `spirituality'. Harrison's long friendship with Ravi Shankar and interest in Indian mysticism, his wicked sense of humour and his warm generosity, his love of privacy in his Surrey home which he carefully re-landscaped himself with spade in hand, all reveal a man who strove, sometimes in small ways and sometimes on a big canvas - like his 1971 visionary project to raise money for victims of the Bangladesh famine, a blueprint for Bob Geldof's `Live Aid' project 15 years later - to make the world a better place; to make a difference.<br /><br />George Harrison was in so many ways an exceptional and atypical rock star, and Martin Scorsese has done him proud with this superb film.

0451228375|5.0|Pillars of the Earth was unforgetable and stands as one of the greatest books I've  read in my lifetime; and World Without End equals or even surpasses the standard of excellence set by that work.  World Without End is neither a sequel, nor a stand-alone novel.  It's the best of both.  It portrays a new cast of characters, but continues the competence and professional excellence established in the first novel.  If you have not yet read these masterpieces of historical fiction, you are fortunate to have that pleasure still lying in your future.  You will be entertained; you will be educated and you will be enthralled by the rich characterization that will leave you loving some cast members and wanting to throttle some others.  Many of the reviews of World Without End mention that the story is too long.  However, the story's richness stems from getting to know the people, as well as the political, religious and scientific environment in which they lived and depiction of these facets requires detail.  I loved this story and would have been quite happy for it to never end.  I felt deflated when I did reach the end of the story and clicked the key that sent it to archive.

0345803485|3.0|This is Twilight - for Adults.  This author owes Meyer royalties for stealing a good part of Bella's and Edward's character.  Let go with the similarities...Anastasia Steele vs. Isabella Swann or Ana vs. Bella.  The flow of the names - spot on.  Both virgins, both clumsy, both have mother's that are rather ditzy and father's that are awkward/stoic.  Both feel \\"lost\\" until they meet him. Both believe they are less attractive then they are. Both are fair skinned brunettes from modest backgrounds.  Both like and quote classic literature. Both are good students, good cooks and home bodies.  Until they meet \\"him\\". Edward Cullen vs. Christian Steele - at least the name flows are not identical.  Both are crazy handsome with thick hair and smoldering eyes.  Neither has been in a successful relationship - until they meet her.  Both have a dark secret.  Both are excellent piano players and sharp dressers.  Both are dominant, jealous, controlling, possessive and over protective.  Both are adopted with adopted siblings.  Each has a parent that is a doctor.  Both are crazy wealthy. Both drive fancy, fast cars.  Both take their girl flying - in Twilight it's jumping tree to tree - but still there.  Both warn their girls that they are monsters and she should stay away.  But darn it - they both are just two smitten with their girl so can't stay away.  Both stories take place in Washington State.  Even their lodging is similar - lots of glass with great views, and modern/white furniture.  So other than the sex scenes - the romance part of the story line is almost identical.  At least in Twilight you get Vampires and Wolves and some plots that are not just about the one relationship.  So if you like Twilight - you should like this book.  I actually had a harder time putting down the Twilight books, than I did this one.

0345803485|1.0|I'm not going to go into a long drawn out reason as to why I was beyond disappointed....Actually you can read all the negative articles prior to my review. Each of them hit it right on the head what was wrong with this book.  I love an erotic novel and have read a few that gives you those butterflies in funny places.  HOWEVER, this book was incredibly off for me...I found that by Book 2 I was flipping over the sex scenes which became so repetitive and  frequent (pretty much every 5th paragraph or so it seemed) that I became annoyed and irritated by them.  I feel like this book could have been condensed to ONE Book had they taken out only Half of the sex scenes, they weren't that great anyway!  And if they called each other Mr and Mrs. ONE MORE TIME!!  UGH....I forced myself to finish Book 2 was curious how it ended and started Book 3 but honestly I became so angry feeling like I had been made a fool of for purchasing these books that I simply walked away from it.  As I watch the media storm about this book and know that my wasted $30 is making a mediocre (at best) writer a millionaire, I have to just shake my head!! As Public Enemy sang oh so many years ago....\\"Don't Don't Don't Believe the Hype\\"  Heck their songs are dirtier than this book!!  Save your money AND your time!!

B007NYODBS|4.0|After seeing \\"Carnage\\", I sat back and thought, \\"Wow. Was that a Roman Polanski movie?\\"  It doesn't really resemble anything Polanski has done previously.<br /><br />However, I think it works.  Polanski has always been interested in human nature, particularly the darker side of it-- the side that people don't openly acknowledge.  So the notion of four people scrapping it out in a flat like rats in a cage, I think, must have had a certain mordant fascination for the filmmaker.<br /><br />People who found it boring should consider the preparation and precision of timing and camerawork that this kind of drama requires.  It's really kind of exhilarating to see the characters/actors sizing each other up in the beginning, and progressing to flurries of jabs, punches and odd protective alliances.  It's like watching a prize fight, or maybe tag team wrestling in the lower moments.  Jodie Foster was brave to take a role that satirizes the politically correct, since many have hung that label around her neck as an actress/celebrity.<br /><br />The current state of America is on display here, too, because the play/movie has undercurrents of class warfare, bullying in the schoolyard, snobbery, and corporate manipulation and indifference.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Polanski is standing to the side and giving America a one-fingered salute.  But he was called \\"Ferret-Face\\" or something like that when he was growing up, and there is that happy hamster running free at the end of the movie... make up your own mind.
B0050PYNN0|2.0|Long ago, in a land far away, an evil sorcerer Leezar kidnaps Belladonna, a beautiful bride of a brave warrior Fabious. Noble Fabious and his \\"useless\\" young brother Thadeous set out to retrieve the bride now locked up in a tower.<br /><br />This is a parody fantasy with some A-list actors and lots of vulgar jokes. The brave warrior is played by James Franco; his slacker brother Danny McBride; the abducted bride by Zooey Deschanel and the sorcerer by Justin Theroux. Oscar winner Natalie Portman appears as Isabel, a mysterious warrior. Rounding out the cast are veterans Charles Dance and Toby Jones.<br /><br />\\"Your Highness\\" should be much funnier. Or something more outlandish. With so many sex jokes, four-letter words and violent deaths, \\"Your Highness\\" is just boring. The film's jokes are not just unfunny; they are weak, repetitive and predictable. When the film runs out of jokes, it changes its tone, turning into an action movie. The action sequences - chases, sword fights and everything - are also weak and repetitive, nothing thrilling. Do we need them?<br /><br />Or do we need Zooey Deschanel and Natalie Portman for the roles that are so dull? Both players, hugely talented, have nothing to do in the film's lame plot that consists of a string of hackneyed jokes. Let them do something and the film could be much better.

B007BVJZ0C|5.0|First of all if you are expecting LotR, then you probably will not enjoy this series. It is gritty (very), it is dark (very), and (very) bad things happen to pretty much everyone, often violently. Those that get ahead are those willing to do anything to do so. That said, once you get past the fact that it doesn't follow the \\"the good guys always win\\" model, it is brilliant. The plot is rich, complicated,and surprisingly believable. The characters are equally complex (even if some of them are downright despicable). The acting is fantastic, even if the special effects are a little lacking, and most of the episodes leave you wondering what is going to happen next (Unless you've read the book, many scenes are word for word the same) It is a great series, but not for the faint of heart.

B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|Haywire is a mainstream action movie the likes of which you'll rarely see.  Directed by Steven Soderbergh, Haywire is also unique for featuring gorgeous MMA fighter Gina Carano in her first starring role as Mallory Kane, a freelance covert op that finds herself double-crossed, betrayed, on the run, and looking for a little payback.  The premise of Haywire is simple, but Soderbergh's deft handling makes what would be an otherwise so-so action flick and makes it something unique thanks to his style.  Carano's line delivery could use some work, but her action sequences are wonderful, and it doesn't hurt that she's quite easy on the eyes.  Also featuring Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton, and Channing Tatum; Haywire is a unique mainstream action flick that deserves your attention.  If flashy, fast-edit action flicks are your thing, you're not going to dig Haywire, but if you're looking for something different, give this a look.

B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I wanted to upgrade my HP P2055dn network Laserjet printer to 384 MB of memory.  This enhances its ability to print complicated forms and documents, speeds up the process of doing dual sided printing and large size printing jobs.  I looked at HP and they wanted $599 for the memory stick (CB423A) for a printer I got on sale for $289.  I purchased this Kingston memory stick for $10.69 and got free shipping as I had purchased another item along with it. That is a savings of over $588!<br /><br />This memory worked perfectly in the new printer.  It literally takes 60 seconds to add the memory and you are done.  You simply turn off the printer, unplug the power cord and the communications cable, open the easy access side door, insert the memory stick, reinstall the door, reconnect the cables and turn on the printer.  Print out a Self-Test/Configuration report and your printer memory should have gone from 128 MB to 384 MB.<br /><br />As a check on Windows 7 Professional I also started Internet Explorer and typed in the IP address of my HP Network printer, I selected Device Configuration and it shows the Total Memory as 384 MB and the Available Memory as 363 MB.  It also shows the DIMM Slot as having installed a 256 MB RAM DIMM.<br /><br />You should also check the settings in your operating system and in my case I selected the Windows Start Button in the lower LH corner and selected Devices and Printers, right clicked on the printer that I had installed the memory into, Select Printer Properties, Select the Device Settings tab, Selected Printer Memory and set it to 320 MB as this was the highest allowed setting and then clicked apply.  You can now click OK and back all the way out of the printer setup.<br /><br />This memory is a great buy and Kingston is a first class company.  I have used some of their other products and they have all been good.  I recommend this memory as a fantastic buy that you cannot pass up on!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Laughed out loud throughout the read.  Quick read that's easy and enjoyable.<br /><br />Have recommended this to many moms.  Tina Fey does a great job of intertwining the hard and wonderful parts of parenting while telling funny (really funny) stories. It's great to laugh along with her.  She also has such a funny way of talking about being a woman, being a working mom, and the challenges she's experienced throughout her career.<br /><br />There's a side benefit of leadership lessons in the book.  The wisdom she imparts (learning from the Improv rule of \\"Yes, and...\\" and lessons learned from Lorne Michaels for example) are interesting (and did I mention FUNNY?).<br /><br />Would recommend to all my mom friends (including my own mom!).
B006VFLIYK|4.0|A good one I read in two days and can't wait for the next installment.  And this is NOT a Lee Child rip-off.
B000YABIQ6|1.0|After enjoying the Sopranos for a few years I was hungry for something of equal quality. Rich, true, complex story telling. I'm sure like many others I was led to Mad Men. Indeed as anyone can see it has lavish, rich, tip-top professional production values. I didn't like Don Draper 1/4th as much as Tony Soprano but you can't have everything. It's like they combed the world to find a Jack Kerouac clone but this one is in advertising. No matter. He has his fans. Still there is the enchanting and beautiful Christina Hendricks playing Joan Harris and the, \\"you can't keep your eyes off her\\" beautiful January Jones playing Betty Draper. But here's the thing. I have read how the creator of this show, Matthew Weiner says it would just be a joke if smoking were not included in this retro show. But this is 2012 not 1963 and we know that such relentless use and glamorizing of smoking (to say nothing of drinking the hard stuff at every possible turn) will, when seen my millions of people will greatly promote smoking which we know very well will lead to grisly miserable death of hundreds if not thousands if not tens of thousands. Yes there is smoking on the Sopranos but the brilliant David Chase has one character nearly coughing to death as he gets another cigarette driving a car and Mr. Sack the New York boss is dying of cancer and says how he had just quit. Mad Men? Well there is Betty Draper very, very pregnant (in season 3) smoking and her father says for her to stop, he doesn't want to see her commit suicide. Then a moment later he says for her to go ahead. Meanwhile, later, he is seen shaking salt on his ice cream and drops dead the every next episode. As if, look! See! People do all kinds of risky behaviors like salting ice cream. I'm merely saying they can have all the smoking they wish but it could be presented in such a way that would discourage people from smoking rather then what this show does. There is no excuse for this \\"willful blindness\\". This is a huge promotion and love song to cigarette smoking and hard drinking and there is a net effect. Profits for them, very happy tobacco executives and a lot of dead people that merely flipped on the T.V. one day. Matthew Weiner, Scott Hornbacher, Maria and Andre Jacquemetton, Black McCormick, Christopher Manley, Jon Mamm, January Jones and the rest that directly showcase smoking belong in jail not on TV.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|I read this book because of the hype and glowing reviews. I really liked the book and I wanted to see what happened at the end, which is really what any good writer should do, but I could not really connect with the characters. Chrissie, the main character has to relive the horror of not remembering her past every time she goes to sleep. She keeps a journal which she updates before she goes to sleep so that she can retain some of her past the next day. The question arises, what is her husband Ben's real motives? I liked some of the twists, one or two of which I worked out. The 'baddie' of the story (whom I won't name so not to spoil the plot) seemed a little wooden and seemed to behave to order. However, I enjoyed the book and finished it in a couple of days.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Both of the Quell games are great fun and have worked flawlessly on all my devices. I highly recommend them both!
0345803485|3.0|ByLorraine KD<br />This review is from: Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy (Paperback)<br />OK the good points. Let's remember that this is a love story and perfectly captures the incredible highs and lows of a first love.  One minute you are unbelievably happy, the next you feel so low.  A young first love (well I know they are both not that young but they are both very immature) can be all consuming, couples often neglecting friendships, work, family etc.  The downside of this book, quite frankly the endless repetition of phrases, Are there too many sex scenes?? Well at first I quite enjoyed them but after the first book, it was a case of \\"here we go again\\" so I  began skipping them, they bored me, and made me want to scream every time she said \\"holy cow\\"!  And for a man with so much money and so many clothes, why does he wear the same grey pants, hanging off his hips, so annoying.  And he is so immature, I wanted to hit him with his ever changing moods (oh yes his mercurial moods, again this was repeated over and over) and his childish<br />jealousy, I just wanted Ana to grow up and stick up for herself but all this simpering \\"Oh my poor damaged Christian I will never leave you\\", crap really bugged me. But then again, this is true to life, it happens so often , a girl becomes besotted with a guy and starts to lose herself, taking on the identity of her man, and putting up with so much crap in the name of love.  well they do say love is blind. Actually it makes my feel a bit sick everytime he says \\"You belong to me, or you're mine\\", come on girl own yourself.<br />Whilst I enjoyed the first book and learning about the sub/dom scene was interesting, I am on the third book and now getting bored, although I will stick with it as I want to know what happens.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I cant understand why they don't have more games like this. fire maple needs to step up and see the demand. this game is amazing. its entertaining, interesting,  the graphics are just a pleasure to look at. its just the best as us the manor game by fire maple. we NEED MORE!!!

0345803485|3.0|I, too, was drawn in by the hype for these books, and they were decent, under-the-sun, beach reading for a summer's day. Not nearly as good as Diana Gabaldon's Outlander books, or even as unique and uplifting as a new, nontraditional, sexy sort-of-romance I just finished reading called King Perry, by a new author, Edmond Manning. Not sure I understand what people are getting out of these.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|adult and kids find it fun,  they love to play . works well on kindle fire.  good distraction in car lol really
B007FH9GT2|5.0|I recently used my Amazon Prime account and rented a movie on line, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Renting the movie on line was easy, fast, and less expensive than the Pay per View I get with AT&T.  I didn't have to go out in the rain to the video rental store either.  I LOVE this service! The movie was great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You love the characters...too much sex but very hard to put down....women will love it..and parts of it are funny.....don't want to see the movie...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely loved this app. I would recommend this to anyone! some of these games can be kind of hard but it also challenges your mind also in a way.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this game is ok. I would like it to be a little more challenging though.  but if you like Mario then yes I think you will like this game.  that's really what this reminds me of.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this app is so fun. I love it! everyone should get this app. its a fun game to play with your friends or a random opponent. you don't even have to be good at drawing. you just have to use your creativity. its fun to guess what your friends are trying to tell you! I completely recommend this awesome app!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got this app over my spring break and I love it if you get it you will play with it a whole lot because you will not get enough of it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|look above. its very fun. the only thing is getting all those points to unlock other games.  its a very fun game.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Ransom Rigg's intriguing tale captivates readers with this tale that bridges from reality into a past that is both real and fantastical.  The blending of worlds and times helps to keep readers questioning what they think they know about the book.  The terrifying portions are made all the more so when the monsters turn up in the real world.<br /><br />Jacob Portman has just the right amount of courage to make him a believable hero, but Riggs doesn't elevate him to an epic level.  Jacob remains accessible to readers because he has moments of cowardice in actions and in thoughts that we can completely understand.  Readers have a hard time coping with the alteration of reality that Jacob discovers just as Jacob himself struggles with it.<br /><br />The writing style increases readers' ability to relate, as Riggs steps into the persona of Jacob with his first person telling of the story.  The incorporation of photographs with the texts lends validity to the story while breaking up the usual expectations.  This layering of two styles coincides nicely with the integration of the real world and the alternate reality that Jacob discovers.<br /><br />The end of this book is the perfect setup for a sequel.  There is enough resolution to warrant the end of one book, but plenty of questions asked that beg for at least one more book to answer them.  In a movie, this would upset me and appear to be a commercial scheme.  This kind of cliff hanger at the end of a book just makes me hungry for the continuation of the story.
B007N85POS|5.0|This game is a great stress release a.d at the same time stresses you out its the game that you lo sand hate.
0793542049|5.0|Great book.  I noticed some other reviews about not being tabs.  I'm a guitar player and have read treble clef my whole life (48yo), so getting used to bass clef isn't easy.  Doing the example exercises is the hardest thing for me, but the author gives you the freedom to use his examples to create your own bass lines and play along with the cd - which is a GOOD TIME! Sometimes I stop to make sure I'm playing and not the CD - I did not expect this.  So my advice is learn your bass clef (online flash cards, practice, etc.) but don't let it prohibit you.  If you know you basics - where the 3rds, 5ths, 7ths, ect.. are in a chord you will enjoy this book!
B005DOKL3E|1.0|I do not recommend this product I think there are better ones out there. It was not easy to put the Kindle Fire inside it.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|You don't have to be someone who has read literally thousands of comic books, and had the nerdy arguments about whether Thor could shatter Captain America's shield with a well-struck blow from his hammer, Mjolnir, to understand just how awe inspiring a movie like Marvel's The Avengers is. That type of person describes me to a tee, but even if that wasn't the case, seeing the likes of Captain America(Chris Evans), Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) and Thor(Chris Hemsworth) all together in one film is enough to make anybody start quoting Joe Biden: \\"This is a big effing deal!!!!\\". The Avengers puts any fanboy fears to rest, and gets the geek juices goin' in a way no other superhero film has ever done. So why even bother trying to be subtle about this? The Avengers is flat out incredible! It is the jaw-dropping, powerhouse comic book movie we all hoped it would be and more!<br /><br />Marvel deserve a ton of credit for the amount of time and precise care they've put into building to this point, properly stoking the fires of the fanbase when necessary, but also playing coy as they dropped hints about where the film might go. They've been building to this moment since we were introduced to the billionaire genius, Tony Stark, back in 2008's Iron Man, where everybody surely remembers that heart stopping moment when cool as ice Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) turned up talking about the 'Avengers Initiative'. As perfect of a job as they did introducing us to the many heroes who make up The Avengers, the smartest move Marvel made, by a very large margin, was in hiring Joss Whedon as director and co-writer. It's largely in part due to him and his technical brilliance, goofy humor, and obvious love for these characters that makes The Avengers the peerless film it turned out to be. Anybody could have come on board and churned out a great looking film with awesome, wide-scale special effects, but few have that intimate knowledge of these characters and how they relate that Whedon clearly has. He was like a kid in a candy store, and all the lollipops were shaped like the superhero favorites from his childhood.<br /><br />A complaint that has been lodged against the film by some is the simplicity of the plot, but those people fail to understand just how necessary that is to accommodate for so many characters who many folks don't know all that well. Most people have no clue who Maria Hill(Cobie Smulders) is, or why she's important in the larger scheme of things. They don't know why Loki(Tom Hiddleston) has such a mad on for his brother, Thor. These things must be addressed in a way that everyone can understand, and to make room for the inevitable, and desperately wanted sequels. Can we get a fast track on those, please? The irony that such a simple but perfect plot could have been written by Zak Penn, the guy who gave us the convoluted mess that was X-men 3, isn't totally lost on me.<br /><br />The film starts out with an image of the Tesseract, and if you don't know what that is don't bother stressing out. It's also known as the Cosmic Cube, and was the MacGuffin of Captain America: The First Avenger, basically a mystical object with unlimited power. It's one of those items that is so insanely ludicrous in what it could do, that in movies like this it never actually does anything. People just fight over it. Nick Fury and the spy guys at S.H.I.E.L.D. have it, and Loki wants it back to become the all-powerful ruler he thinks himself to be. Setting his sights on their HQ, Loki cuts a destructive path through Fury's forces, stealing the Tesseract and possessing the minds of agent Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye(Clint Barton), and Dr. Erik Selvig(Stellen Skarsgard). With the country now at war from a super-powered threat, Fury is forced to try and pull together all the heroes he knows to combat the threat. Good luck with that. But wait...how can Loki possibly stand against the combined might of The Avengers all by himself? Easy. By employing the alien Chitauri to be his back-up. There's a perfectly calibrated, comical yet intense verbal throwdown between Loki and Tony Stark that sums up their characters on the nose. To sum it up: both are pompous asses.<br /><br />One of the trademarks of The Avengers is the combination of volatile personalities, and it quickly becomes apparent that they are their own worst enemy. A team made up of loners with their own personal agendas, conflict is unavoidable, and Whedon mines it for all that it's worth. Iron Man's flashy, indulgent personality rubs the modest, conservative Captain America the wrong way. Actually, Iron Man doesn't seem to get along with anybody, brawling with Thor and trying to provoke Bruce Banner into revealing his meaner, greener side. Whedon does a fantastic job of giving everyone their moment to shine, especially the characters who could have easily been lost in the shuffle: Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye.  In fact, Black Widow is the catalyst for much of what happens in the film's opening hour, tracking down Banner and revealing her deep, personal feelings towards Hawkeye. Having him taken over by Loki was a smart move, as it gives his character a reason to stand out from the pack....besides looking really cool with a bow and arrow.<br /><br />The biggest stand out amongst the cast is a new addition, and that's Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. Marvel has been trying to get the Hulk perfect for years, starting with Erica Bana in Ang Lee's underrated 2003 film, then with Edward Norton in 2008's The Incredible Hulk. Both were successful in their own way, but Ruffalo hits the nail right on the head in every respect. What Norton and Bana missed was that they tried to play Banner as too depressed, too passive. That has never been the character. He's a guy who understands his rages, and the nervous ticks he shows, such as his inability to ever be completely still, aren't so much for his own sake as they are out of concern for everybody else. Some of the film's best moments come as Banner and Stark, two technological and scientific marvels, banter back and forth in a language way too smart for anybody to totally understand. Plus, this version of the Hulk is just a heck of a lot more fun, as Whedon builds up the anticipation to his inevitable transformation in much the same way he toyed with us in The Cabin in the Woods. When the crap finally hits the fan and the Jade Giant emerges, he's the destructive force of nature Banner had done such a marvelous job warning everybody about.<br /><br />Whedon adds all the little touches that you know he's been dying to show on the silver screen for ages. One that fanboys will appreciate is the fate of the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, always the first casualty of any major event. And you know, as we see the entire team locked in an enclosed office, bickering like schoolchildren, that Whedon has been dreaming up exactly how that little family squabble would go for years. There are so many ingenious moments that to list them all would take longer than the film's 2 1/2 hour runtime. Nobody balances humor with genuine stakes better than Whedon does.<br /><br />As gifted as Whedon and Penn prove to be with the dialogue, the special effects also prove to be something extraordinary. Cities get destroyed, powers fly, and Hulks smash with reckless abandon. In IMAX 3D it's especially impressive. Whedon has been a director capable of making the most with sometimes limited resources, and given the ample backing of Marvel and Paramount, he's free to cut loose, and it's an opportunity he simply doesn't waste.<br /><br />Ok, so this is basically a gush fest, but that's exactly what The Avengers inspires. There will be other superhero movies coming out this year, and they all will scratch a very specific kind of itch. The Avengers is the summer movie to end all summer movies, and probably the only one we'll see this year that not only meets our lofty expectations, but far and awaysurpasses them!else.

B003EYVXUU|5.0|I like the foreign version, \\"Let The Right One In\\", but seeing \\"Let Me In\\" was way better. \\"Let The Right One In\\" was pretty good, but it was a very low budget film. The humor was okay, but some of it I didn't get. I also didn't know what was going on at times, as I didn't understand what the movie was trying to explain.<br /><br />Now for the movie, \\"Let Me In\\" is a better American adaptation of the foreign movie. I found that I could relate to the movie more and understand what was happening better.  I also thought the star Chloe Moretz had awesome performance. And really showed of her acting skills. The graphics in this movie was great, as they were fast pace and realistic. I like how this movie ended compared to the original movie as it explained more to what happens to them after the movie.<br /><br />I recommend this movie over the original.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I picked up this second book the day I finished Book 1.  I had this book done in 2 days.  Something about these books just draw you in.<br /><br />This book picks up days after Book 1 which I really like.  And while the physical chemistry/bedroom action continues, this time around the story isn't solely about them/sex but includes a subplot.  And while book 1 was about Ana experiencing new things, this time Christian is the one experiencing a new way of life and many firsts.<br /><br />While in Book 1 I didn't really feel the writing was bad, now I have to agree with some of the reviewers that have complained about the repetition in the writing.  In Book 1 she had my complete attention the entire time, where in this one after countless rounds of sex, I found myself thinking, \\"here we go again, sex time\\" and not really into what was going on. I was more interested in the plot and what was going to happen that involved what was outside of their relationship. This time it was another scene, another panty drop.  One of my friends that is reading the same book said she's getting tired of reading \\"I'm going to take you now\\" which I found hilarious. While some things changed, it was pretty much written as \\"sexual trigger, kiss, pant, pant, tease, foil packet and bliss in unison\\".  Nobody has that kind of moment EVERY time.  And much of the general dialogue is repetitive.  But not so much that I couldn't enjoy the story.<br /><br />The emails are in this and continue to be enjoyable.<br /><br />For repetitive writing, I'd give this a 3 star.  But since the plot was about more than just their sex life and it was engaging, I gave this book 4 stars, because I really did like the overall storyline, which is the main point of reading a book.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the final book.<br /><br />NOTE:<br />I also agree with the readers that have complained about the Kindle book costing more than the paperback. What a joke!  We pay more for digital format than those thatbuy books that use actual materials and printing costs?? Cmon publisher!<br /><br />I read that Ian Somerhalder from Vampire Diaries said he would be interested in playing Christian in the movie.  He would be PERFECT in my book.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters first and loved it! Then, I bought this on Amazon when it came out! It has awesome storyline. Great characters and much character development! . Great humor and the reason why I loved it so much.<br /><br />There's a lot of extra contain that came with the Blu-Ray version that I liked and that's why I got the Blu-Ray and not the DVD version.<br /><br />Everyone should watch this movie, if they want to see something that has great humor and way out there.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Many games are blatant rip-offs of classic games, most compromise quality, and several are pretty similar to other games in the collection.  Ads pop up after games and could easily give problems to children.  But overall playability and concepts are worthwhile.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Heard so much about this book - had to get it!  Did not disappoint!  Couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.  Didn't have to wait for pages to go by to get action, it happened quickly.  LOVE the characters, and how they handle a difficult relationship.  Yes - learned a lot about a world not familiar with.  Could not put it down at times - been a long time since I've enjoyed such a journey!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|keeps the kids busy while traveling! no more of that ...(are we there yet!) nice peaceful trips. also keeps them occupied on those rainy days!
0812992792|5.0|Amazon got it right. This was an excellent book. I found myself getting up in the middle of the night to read it. It is a thriller and a love story. The violence and corruption was at times hard to read, but certainly brings home the truth about ignoring individual freedoms, dictatorships and the things we take for granted here in the US.<br /><br />I am recommending this book to friends and relatives.<br />A great story that stays with you long after the last paragraph.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this cooler to replace the stock CPU fan/heatsink for an old Core 2 Quad Q9550.  It was getting really hot on stock cooling, where it can go up to 65 C!  This was with Artic Silver 5 too!  I have it sitting on a EVGA nforce 790i ultra.<br /><br />I put the hyper 212+ with Artic Silver 5, and now my cores idle around 38-44C while the CPU temp reads 32 C, compare to 40 C + before on stock cooling.  I'd say on average, it dropped 8-12 C degrees.<br /><br />212+ is big, but it actually fits even with my motherboard that had giant heatsinks surrounding all 4 sides of the CPU socket.<br />However, it didn't fit my Cosmos S case (several yrs old), I had to force it just a bit because 212+ is too tall.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great product and I recommend it for those who wants to save some $$ but still not compromise on cooling performance.

Fifty Shades has been my gym read while on a stationary bike and it became difficult to know what was making me sweat more Christian Grey or my effort.

B005I4JG80|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I have tried reading other parenting books and they mostly either drove me nuts with there drivel or were just obnoxiously boring. Pamela Drunkerman has not only written a great parenting book but one that is actually enjoyable to read. I love her comparisons and her personal stories. I find her honesty about her raising children abroad in Paris refreshing. I am using some of the idea's right now with my own daughter. She is 3 and they are working fabulously. We have been complimented numorous times on how well she behaves, eats and enjoys herself in the company of both adults and other children. If you want a great read that may also help your family life. This is a must read.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|If you haven't seen \\"Firelight\\" you are missing a terrific movie.  I hesitated buying this DVD because of the Asian characters on front.  I was afraid it was in Chinese or something.  It's not.  This is an English version that plays great in my DVD [not blueray] and it looks just like every other English speaking movie I have ever seen.  No problems with it.  I highly recommend it.  The casting and the acting are perfection.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|This book did not impress my very inquisitive 3 year old. The art was ok, but really--there are much more interesting and relevant ways to teach the colors of blue, green, red and yellow. There was no story and the rhyming was a bit lame. Sorry to be blunt. Save your $.99.
B007V9YF5E|2.0|This movie is really lousy and is not worth paying full price. I'm not even sure I'd recommend that you pay 99 cents when it goes on sale, but if you really need to see it for yourself, I'd say be patient and wait until it goes on sale, at least you won't be as disappointed as I am.<br /><br />I admit, I've never even heard of this film or this new action star Gina Carano before I stumbled across this title in the Amazon lineup today. And if you didn't know about any previous reviews, which I didn't, yet wish that I did...well, the trailer makes it seem like it will be an exciting action film. Unfortunately, the trailer severely misrepresents the film. It's very slow to start, and the action sequences are few and far between. Now, in a film with a better story, and better acting, well, that would not necessarily be too bad, however, this new action star cannot act to save her life and the story is weak. She can fight, she's got a pretty face and a sultry voice, I will give her that, but that is not enough to make a good actress nor is it enough to make this film even remotely entertaining. Carano basically has two expressions throughout the entire film, which are - the determined to catch my guy and kick his ass face, and the slight smile, annoying biting her lip face which she does way too often to make it cute. She also stumbled on some lines a bit, which they actually allowed to remain in the film, and I can only think they allowed it to remain because she probably botched the line so many times that they just gave up so as not to waste any more time or film.<br /><br />To make matters worse, they put this newbie in a cast with top actors like Douglas, Banderas and McGregor which makes her horrendous acting stand out all the more. I'm not meaning to be harsh here, but to explain it best just how bad her acting is, well...I've seen made for the Sci-Fi channel B movies with better acting, and that is not really saying much. She really needs to take some classes before doing her next film, and if she already has had a small bit of drama lessons, she needs to look into a better acting school.ore doing her next film, and if she already has had a small bit of drama lessons, she needs to look into a better acting school.

B00024I2Z4|4.0|MULAN is another good animation from the DISNEY studios...it´s not one of my favorites, but is nice with great graphics and beautiful songs! NICE!
B0039PPW60|4.0|Has many features for a rather low price, but it is hard to know how to use all the features because the documentation is lacking.<br /><br />The manual does not describe how to use all the mixer buttons, sends & returns; (seems like they assume you have been a sound engineer for a long time, or won't use all the features).<br /><br />Behringer has not yet published the USB version of the Schematic drawing, but does have the non-USB version (nearly identical) on their website, to show how everything is internally connected with a simplified drawing. [Google search 1204FX_P0554_V3_YY.pdf ]<br /><br />This mixer is also close to the Mackie Mixer, which explained some of the similar functions very well in their manual at:  [Google 1202VLZ3_OM.pdf, or download at Mackie web site]<br /><br />The effects are nice (they are programmable, I use weaker settings than the defaults for reverb & Chorus).<br /><br />The main attraction for me of this mixer was the built in compressors, (one of my singers doesn't consistently move away from the mic for loud passages).  However, the compressor sound wasn't pleasing when turned up very high.  (So I ended up getting the FMR Audio RNC 1773 \\"REALLY NICE COMPRESSOR\\", which cost as much as the mixer).  If you don't need all 4 mic inputs, you can patch the channels to run several Behringer compressors serially at low settings, which does sound nicer).<br /><br />The Pre-amplifiers worked well with my sensitive Condenser mics (w/ 48V phantom),  but my dynamic mic needed more gain and didn't sound as good (pre-amps seem to have more noise at maximum settings). So I use an external standalone pre-amp for mics needing more gain.<br /><br />Some of the sliders/fadders and buttons have wiggle in them, but work well enough.<br /><br />Since this has just one headphone output, I also got (and am happy with) the low cost Behringer HA400 Microamp 4 Channel Stereo Headphone Amp, with individual volume controls for each singer/musician.<br /><br />All-in-all, you get a lot for the money.  Similar units are made by Yamaha (also good value), and Mackie (sturdier but more expensive).
B000YMJA7I|3.0|this GREATEST HITS compilation got a lot of great cool rock songs, for sure...but SO MANY GEMS are missing!!!!GUNS got only 4 albuns, and i trully think that buying APPETITTE FOR DESTRUCTION, GUNS debut, is WAY better than this compilation...The 2 USE YOUR ILUSION too...Both got only great rockers!!!GUNS was a gifted band until AXL´s EGO destroys everything...DO yourself a music favour and buy APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION and both USE YOUR ILUSION...
0545265355|5.0|The book Hunger Games is by far one of my favorite books ever. I think the author did a very well job on writing this book. This book made a lot of teens want to read this book, and want to go see the movie. I like how the author described a lot of the outline of all of the districts, and how their lives were, before really starting the book. Also, I absolutely love the battle scene. All the weapons in the middle, and the descriptions of all the weapons and the surrounding landscape, I thought was a very great part of the book. This is a fantastic book, and I recommend this book to everyone who loves adventure, and fighting books. Also, if you like this book, I recommend the book Legend. I hope you enjoyed this review, and have a great day. I hope you chose to read this book, because it is AMAZING!!!
B00002Z88D|3.0|the 2 songs written for SeM are nice, but i gotta say that ALL the METALLICA songs are WAY WAY better without the simphony harmonies...of course i can enjoy the violins and the new harmonica, but for my taste that  destroyed the brutal raw fast feeling that i love from METALLICA!!Anyway, this is a decent album...but i will stick with the brutal ones without the orchestra
0545425115|5.0|Last year around Halloween, I read this book. It had me suck in from the beginning. Suzanne Collins has struck gold with this book. I've heard that it was on the New York Times Best Sellers List for weeks on end, after it came out. I love how it has action but with underlying romance. Katniss is such a strong character and a great role model. And then you have Peeta who is so sweet and kind and loving, but strong. You also have Gale who will do anything to protect his family and friends. This love triangle I have to say is way better than the one in twilight. All through the book you will be captivated. Plus at the end there's this twist that you could never see coming. Not even in a million years. Also when you finish it you will have to rush out and get the second one. And I have to say Team Peeta all the way! I give this book 5 stars
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Clearly is the best action movie of the year.<br />A lot of action. Better than Captain America, and MUCH better than Thor and Iron Man 2.<br />It is really good. Here in my country it was sold out by 5 straight days, every hour, every movie theater, literally from 11 am to midnight.<br />I saw it two times, and I wanted to see it a third time, but I did not found an available ticket.

B007QRWXJG|1.0|Lame, lame, lame, why am I even watching this POS? I used to like it, I guess that's why. I just couldn't believe that it could get worse than the opening episode but it did. Ten minutes on \\"filler\\" at a dinner party presumably attended by Timothy O'Leary where Spencer indulges in LSD. Twenty minutes spent on Spencer's babbling under LSD - who cares? Twenty minutes spent on Don looking for what's her face after leaving her in a Howard Johnson's parking lot; ho-humm; blah; lame, lame, lame. It did get worse.<br /><br />It's as if the writer just couldn't come up with anything and just wrote and wrote and wrote, hoping that something good would come out - id didn't.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I actually started reading the Hunger Game Series because of my teenage daughter.  We always read the same book simultaneously so that we can have discussions about the book.  I am GLAD that she asked to read the series.  I read when I walk on the treadmill.  This book kept me walking farther because I didn't want to put the book down.  Excellent book and I would recommend it for anyone over 13 years old.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Its is a very addicting game that surprisingly doesn't require u to pay real money to get to last lvl (especial the fact that glu made it). I had reached Lvl 50 yesterday and tried to play today but for some reason out of nowhere the game will no longer start. after pressing 'start game'  It will go in loading screen and wont stop only way to exit the app is to force close it (on kindle)<br /><br />If it wasn't for that id rate it a 4 because if u wish to reach the end of the game without paying u need to grind for money nonstop for hours. I like the game cause some levels require strategy and u need to make the best with what u got on u to win. Hopefully they resolve the Freeze problem until then I cant play

B004MPESSY|1.0|Despite gory disturbing films usually being blacklisted as trash, there are some genuinely good movies with graphic scenes of violence and rape, Irreversible, Martyrs and Ichi the Killer come to mind. So before you say \\"this isn't a Disney flick stupid\\" I know that, I came into this film expecting at least some form of catharsis or gruesome entertainment, which this film has, but what bothered me about this film handles it's graphic material.<br /><br />Let's talk about the rape scene shall we? Oh sorry did I say scene, I meant chunk of the movie, because it lasts for about 40 minutes. 40 minutes of non stop abuse/rape. It almost got comical because when one of the hillbillies or whatever were done having fun with the girl another one jumped right back on her at least five more times, it was like the never-ending ending to Return of the King; until finally she's crawling through the dirt completely naked and nearly comatose in shock. Ok, so we get this long brutal rape scene, maybe they're trying to top Irreversible or whatever so ok, that was disturbing, now the movie has my attention using the cheapest trick in the book, now what do they do?<br /><br />Well the interesting thing about this movie is that it follows the victims only, letting the attackers use the ol' \\"get out of plot inconvieniences free\\" card throughout. So the first half of the movie you see the girl do boring things that no one paid to see until the big rape scene comes, all through the perspective of the victim, the heroine (if you can call her that.) Then the second half the hillbillies realize she's still alive and enacting revenge on them, and it completely follows them around for the last half of the movie.<br /><br />My problem with this is if you're going to show a character go through a long and torturous hell, you better develop the character, otherwise we might as well be watching a high quality snuff film. The woman after her horrific ordeal is never on camera again unless she's torturing someone, *snore*. After she fell into the river I would've been much MUCH more interested in seeing her frantically escape her captors, collect herself again, and then exact revenge. If you take time to develop the character, her motives, and illustrate her mentality more the revenge part has more of an impact than. If you just jump to the violence, skipping all character development than all the meaning is lost, and that's exactly what the director did with this film, he chose the easy way.<br /><br />So instead of the film showing us character development it pads itself out with useless scenes such as the hillbillies arguing and complaining. We don't need to see the hillbillies that much, we know they're bad, we can assume they're probably pissed off they lost the girl, and we know the girl is going to get her revenge just by looking at the cover. The director either A) doesn't know how to film a scene WITHOUT someone getting horribly mutilated/tortured and B) assumes the audience is so rabid with bloodlust that we don't want to have our time wasted by anything else. I'm going to guess the answer is (A) though because even if this was just a splatter flick we still get some boring filler scenes.<br /><br />So finally we get to the part we've been waiting for, the girl's revenge, and I do admit the death scene with the crows was creative and gruesome, but otherwise it's like some cheap SAW knock-off that involves penises and anuses more, basically if you haven't gotten the idea this film's purpose is to be disgusting as possible. One by one the characters are taken captive through the power of plot convienence. This would've been another instance where the narritive should've focused on the girl hunting down her targets, plotting her next move and giving the audience an insight into her character's intellect more, instead we get scenes where the main hillbilly shouts on his front lawn \\"I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE\\". Eventually she takes them all out then sits outside and stares at the camera. The End!<br /><br />So after sitting through a 40 minute rape and watching graphic violence, I wondered why the hell I just sat through I Spit on your Grave. Gore and shock can be great additions to give a movie more of a bite, just look at Robocop; but in this movie the centerpiece IS gore and violence. I Spit on your Grave is boring when people aren't getting tortured and unnecessarily repulsive when they are. If you want yet another Craven remake the Hills Have Eyes and Last House on the Left have much more fleshed out and interesting characters that the audience can grow to care for. If you just want to see how disgusting a movie can get there are countless better ones that spare the boring details such as August Underground Mordum, the Guniea Pig series, or even the recent Human Centipede 2. This movie is like some bastard child between these cult gore-fests and a profitable/appealing hollywood remake, and the whole outcome is just a boring and repulsive mess. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy.e and stares at the camera.

B004GUSG4M|4.0|Once you suspend questions about the underlying premise -- that there's a form of amnesia that causes victim to forget what she learned in a day after a night's sleep -- you will be rapidly drawn into the story that unfolds, day by day, discovery by discovery.<br /><br />From the moment I read about the protagonist looking at her hands and thinking they are her mother's I found it difficult to put this book down.<br /><br />We read Before I Go to Sleep for our book club and all agreed. We were also intrigued by the author's use of initials for a name -- a clue perhaps that it was a man writing in a woman's voice. He nailed it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I picked this book up at the behest of two of my friends.  At first I really didn't have any desire to read it and the media frenzy really didn't help that either.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book.  The most intriguing part of the story were the many, many, many layers of Christian Grey.  I could sing his praises from the rooftops, but I won't. :)  Towards the end of the first book I was so exasperated by Christian that I wanted to throw my iPad across the room several times.  By the end of the third book, I was in love! (Well, I was starting to fall in book 1, but anywho!) There are many who dislike this trilogy for whatever reason (maybe because it started out as Twilight fan fiction), but do yourself a favor and give it a chance.  You might actually enjoy it!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I have to say I really enjoyed this book overall. The first 1/3 of the book is the better part, as he draws you into the world and creates a lot of mystery around what's happening etc. The rest is mostly action, missions, fighting etc which is still well written, but lacked the intrigue I got from the first part. Overall it's pretty fast paced and easy to read. I read it in just two evenings so it's probably on the short side.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it very very fun. although could use a quicker life refill.  thank you for the fun fun fun fun

Thank you to all that contributed to this magnificent film.  By watching it you realize what an impact that George had on music, mysticism, spirituality in our culture of the 60's to the present.  He gave the Beatles a special sound and direction.  His solo career expanded his gift to keep on innovating.  I feel that I have been eternally touched and hope that you will be too.

B006RED4GA|1.0|This was a SNOOZEFEST just like the director Ti West's overrated 'House of the Devil'. I'm sick of seeing people so desperate for 80s style horror that they accept whatever this guy gives them. I love 80s horror movies too and am very familiar with most of them, but there are a LOT better recent 80s style movies that are superior to this sad crap. 80s style doesn't mean 'boring' to me, but obviously it does to the director. Apparently all it takes is retro clothes, 80s set designs and 80s music to win over some people. After this awful garbage (the second boring flick in a row from the same guy) I'm avoiding the so-called 'director' Ti West like the plague.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Game was a lot of fun... until it reset everything to 200+ hours.  I played this game for hours, expanding my little town, healing sick settlers, chopping wood, farming, and moving up the levels.  One day I opened the game to return to play and found that EVERYTHING (crops, buildings, animals, trees) had reset to over 200 hours.  Now it reminds me that my settlers are depressed, but it won't let me do anything.  Even my sick settler was reset.  Had I spent real money purchasing in-game cash, I would be irate.  As it is, I downloaded the game for free and am only miffed.  :)  The game itself is a lot of fun, just keep in mind that you could get stuck at any time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Oh, I wanted to hate this book with its too frequent usage of \\"inner goddess\\" and Twilight copying.  However, it was a FUN read.  I could not put it down.  The story was just original enough that you forgot about Bella and Edward, and romantic enough to forgive the too frequent sex.  I think it is one book that will be a fantastic movie.  NC-17 perhaps.

B0073J9SGS|5.0|Considering Rufus's much flaunted genetic musical pedigree he's always been one of those people I paid more attention to than you might think. I was very much exposed to his early releases such as [[ASIN:B000007SFM Rufus Wainwright]] and [[ASIN:B00005IBGQ Poses]] when they came out. But they were my mothers CD's,not mine. These albums were very orchestrated cabaret influence baroque pop. One thing I instantly appreciated about him was openly and candidly discussing his homosexuality,with all his youthful and lustful blitzes intact. As he grew creatively as a person he began exploring this music and lyrical subject matter more broadly on his [[ASIN:B000BWGEPM Want 1 & 2]],where he had a more mature and sometimes saddening outlook. I must admit while he released other albums after,by 2007 I admit I sort of lost track of him.  When I heard he was making an album that not only included the Dap Kings but a more 70's rock and soul type direction I was very excited. In the end the album is far better than even my wildest expectations.<br /><br />  From the opening title track on it's just impressive. The first part that struck me is Rufus's singing,once a rather whiny and slow drawl I honestly never got too into now has simmered into lyrical and very versatile croon. That opener plus the bouncy \\"Jericho\\" and \\"Rashida\\" definitely where that California pop/rock sound in it's sleeve. The lyrics and songwriting style though are still...Rufus. The soulful \\"Barbara\\" and almost polka pop styled \\"Welcome To The Ball\\" both benefit from the fluttery synthesizers and strong cinematic productions. \\"Montauk\\" is one of the more symphonic tunes here. And the lyric is presented in such a way where you cannot tell if it's about a step father or...a man having a same sex extra marital affair. Well at least I wasn't sure which one. On \\"Bitter Tears\\" the Eurodisco,late 70's ABBA concept is laid on thick but the dance beats don't show up until the send of the song. On the slower and more singer/songwriter type numbers \\"Respectable Dive\\",\\"Sometimes You Need\\",\\"Song For You\\" and the bag pipe powered \\"Candles\\" Rufus goes from exploring one his his sinning/redemption themes. Probably with some tongue in cheek on the redemption part a bit but it's there. \\"Perfect Man\\" a a great combination of soul and pop/rock as this album has too.<br /><br />  Believe it or not this is the first Rufus Wainwright album I ever bought. This has nothing to do with any dislike of him. It's just that even with people I generally always like,there are some stylistic ventures that appeal to me more than others when it comes to music. Upon previewing this and reading descriptions it was clear this album would be the ideal first Wainwright album for someone with my tastes. Is that a little self serving?Sure maybe. But everyone is guided by their own musical tastes to a degree. To say otherwise would be lying to oneself. Anyway I digress. This album has a big 70's pop/soul/rock type production but it's not the theatrical and occasionally over the top cabaret type orchestral productions that were common on some of Rufus's earlier recordings. He's generally chosen to view his musical career as a journey. He'll go through a specific phase and move onto another influenced to a degree by the one before. There's a lot of progression from his beginnings fifteen years ago to what people will find here. Yes he still has a songwriting,lyrical and vocal style you can always tell from a mile away. But he likes to make it go in different directions. His music has basically been liked subdivided parts of one self. And if so I'm liking where this little division is taking him.r/songwriter type numbers \\"Respectable Dive\\",\\"Sometimes You Need\\",\\"Song For You\\" and the bag pipe powered \\"Candles\\" Rufus goes from exploring one his his sinning/redemption themes.

B00723NWJE|4.0|Despite all the easy listening fans who were captivated a decade ago by \\"Don't Know Why\\" and her debut album [[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away With Me]] (the British singer Nellie McKay even made a farce of this phenomenon with her own debut album) one could always rather tell there was a broad range in this singer/songwriter's interest than quiet,jazzy pop. She took plenty of critical acclaim,commercial success and even her meanest detractors who nastily referred to her as \\"Snorah Jones\\" all in very good stride,even admitting there was a certain truth to it all. Creating her own trend paid off for her in more ways than one. At the same time,on scattered occasions on her previous two albums along with her many collaborative projects it was clear her creative energy was by no means one dimensional. How many artists speak again and again of \\"musical changes\\" they plan to make but never in fact make them,right? Well Norah isn't (and never was) that person. So here she is a decade into her career and has decided it was time to make that change.<br /><br />  While not at all a ballad free free album all these songs have more the effect of being stark than sparse. As it apparent with the cover art there's a definite interest in B-Movie/spaghetti western style music effects here such as heavily reverbed slide guitar in minor chords and a very noirish production overall. I must say a couple of these reviewers are fair enough to mention one thing about this. The songwriting isn't particularly consistent. Sometimes music is created more for a textural and lyrical effect than songwriting. That doesn't mean there aren't some good songs here. \\"Good Morning\\" is a good opener as is the more tougher,bass driven soul/rocker \\"Happy Pills\\" and the title songs. These songs also showcase a far darker atmosphere than earlier albums,culminating on this psychopathic murder from a woman scorned on \\"Miriam\\" which, like Paul McCartney's \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" has a deceptive melodic/lyric combination. \\"Say Goodbye\\" is also a darker soul/blues type number with more strong reliance on the groove.<br /><br />  So what does this album represent for Norah Jones? Well primarily it's an instrumental,production and lyrical showcase. The songs themselves don't really reveal themselves as separate entities as much as extensions of a central theme. And that theme,especially if your lucky enough to have got this somewhere that provided you with the separate lyric booklet as I did,is rejection of sort or another. Throughout Norah is playing herself up as the jilted lover. And by the end she actually seems to be living out some type of fantasy where she wins out by extremely drastic means. It does in fact play out almost like an audio sex thriller in a way. Especially combined with the kind of music that's used here. It's not like some of the earlier Norah Jones albums you could make out to on some modern lovers lane. That is,unless your name happens to be Hannibal Lecter or something. The primary change that Jones is making here is more thematic than anything. So if it's mood music your coming to her for,and if that mood you seek is a romantic one this may not be the album for you. If you want to hear Norah in a totally different mind frame your in for a treat.ation. \\"Say Goodbye\\" is also a darker soul/blues type number with more strong reliance on the groove.<br /><br />  So what does this album represent for Norah Jones?

B003UMW68Y|4.0|The item says that it is a 2 disc combo, but it isn't a Blu-Ray and DVD, it's a Blu-Ray and a DVD file that you can download into your iTunes for free. If you're still living in DVD land like I am, this isn't a good idea unless you just want to watch on your computer until you cave and buy a Blu-Ray player. So be warned! If you have a Blu-Ray player, buy it, it's awesome.
B000TRSAAG|5.0|What could be more perfect than the \\"Three Bosses\\" (Bud Powell, Kenny Clarke and Pierre Michelot) backing Dexter?<br /><br />Gordon's chops have always amazed me, and they are evident on this album as is his versatility. He cuts through Bird's Scrapple from the Apple and Dizzy's Night in Tunisia as though he is playing an alto instead of tenor, then adds a wonderful touch to the rest of the standards on the album. I loved every track, but Willow Weep for Me and Our Love Is Here to Stay are my favorites.<br /><br />While Bud Powell may have been in his decline when this was recorded in 1963, it is still a joy to hear him on these tracks. His powers may have greatly diminished, but he still managed to add to the album with his playing in my opinion - if for no other reason than his style and playing were unmistakable and there was something ineffable added to the music just by having him play. As an aside, Bud was a last minute replacement for Kenny Drew, and I've heard that the track selections were based on Bud's abilities to play them versus any new material that Dexter may have wanted.  Michelot and Clarke are favorites of mine as well, and as a drummer I have a soft spot for Clarke since he is the father of bebop drumming. Few people take the time to carefully listen to and study his playing because he has a light touch and a deep understanding of the music itself. His playing here (and Michelot's bass) demonstrate why they were part of the \\"Three Bosses\\".<br /><br />This is among my desert island albums - a handful that I treasure above all others. Every jazz aficionado should own a copy in my opinion, and those new to jazz will find that this is accessible and easy to enjoy.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This book is a must-read.  The beautiful and sensitive prose moves you through a very difficult subject - a subject that cannot be ignored in today's society.  Thought-provoking and heart-wrenching and impossible to put down.  \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" is a book that will inspire all of us to keep talking.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Between the website and my Android phone and now my Kindle Fire, I get a lot of utility out of this app. One thing I did was make an \\"emergency\\" note with who I am, emergency contacts, medical info, etc., and put it as a shortcut on the main homescreen of my phone. This way if I am ever, say, in a car accident or something and not able to communicate (due to being unconscious or--god forbid--dead), if they look at my phone they'll see this \\"Emergency\\" icon and click it and get all this information instantly. I can update it easily from a web browser and keep it up to date. Very handy! I also keep notes for other tidbits of info that you find yourself needing just when you're not in a place to get them, like my husband and son's SSN's and all of my different airline frequent flyer numbers, various account numbers, etc. I have a note with my health insurance info, and a note with a to-do list that I add to all the time... I think I'd say that this is one of the most useful apps I have.

I haven't seen the blueray as I got it for my sister because they have a flat screen HD tv but the regular DVD is excellent quality.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|I am just grateful that Olivia decided to release this CD separately from the DVD that it has been paired with.  This was not the case with the UK release, which only had the CD available with the Deluxe DVD set.  All the songs have been heard before, and, admittedly, the set list is short, but the intimacy provided by the demos and early takes more than makes up for those facts.  In short, an understated, but beautiful album.  I only hope that Olivia will see fit to release more...

B000OIZUW6|5.0|I have read quite a few wwII spy novels & this is one of the best, if not the best. The hero is not a man, but a young woman who plays a cat & mouse game with a German major. The book has so many twists & turns it keeps you wanting to finish the book without putting it down. Just when you think the heroine has the upper hand, there's a twist & turn, and when you think the major has the upper hand, another twist & turn. Excellent spy novel.
B0014JKJJI|5.0|I work in a restaurant kitchen, so non-slip, oil resistant shoes are a requirement. I've had quite a few different brands, and the tread wears down to the point that they start to slip within six months for nearly every pair I've owned. I've had these for around eight months now, and they barely show any signs of wear. That makes them well worth the little extra they cost over other brands.<br /><br />They don't seem to be quite as slip resistant as others I've had, but still more than enough to be safe. I imagine that's the trade-off for them not wearing down as quickly.<br /><br />They do seem to run a bit large, I generally wear a 9 1/2 to a 10 and these have a roomy, but not too loose fit in a size 9. They clean off easily, and they're pretty comfortable. I leave mine closed to protect from spilling hot liquids on my feet, but being able to cut open the air vents on the side is a nice feature.<br /><br />There's only really so much that can be said for kitchen clogs, but these work great.

0767803434|4.0|One of the most memorable scenes for me was when Harrison Ford hid behind one seat but turned the neighboring seat to make it look like he was crouched there instead. So when he jumped out and attacked the hijacker I got a nice jolt. This masculine thriller has good pacing and acting but there were a few amateurish special effects that detracted from its realism.

B004EPYZUS|5.0|I have not been a fan of the Mission: Impossible films starring Tom Cruise, it has nothing to do with Cruise, who is a fine movie star, but that the overbaked storielines and outlandish special effects have always made them seem more mission improbable to me. However, after sitting through three uneventful films, all from first rate directors who seemed to be following studio direction rather than their own exceptional creative skills, I was seriously surprised to actually enjoy the latest installment. It is every pit as preposterous as every other entry in the franchise, but this one has a sharper wit and brighter intellectual integrity. In no way due I mean that this is a brainy film, that just wouldn't work for this sort of series, but it doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence like some of the previous offenders in the ongoing movie franchise.<br /><br />The set up is fast and exciting, with a more authentic feel to it, the first noticeable CGI effects don't rear there facial head until thirty minutes into the story. The set up is as a thriller, the pay off is an adventure. Globe trotting from the Kremlin to Dubai to Mumbai, with an amicable cast of colorful characters played by likable actors. Cruise, as I've already stated is a great movie star, his charisma and screen presance help to make him one of the last remaining classical film stars. The supporting cast is equally strong with [[ASIN:B00275EGWY The Hurt Locker]] star Jeremy Renner nearly stealing the film in a role that is said to be an enventural replacement for Cruise's Ethan Hunt. Simon Pegg is stronger in this entry than he was in the previous film, using a light comic touch, instead of his more broad approach. Sweedish actor Michael Nyquist, best known to American audiences as the original Mikael Blomkvist in [[ASIN:B005JTLTI4 Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition]], makes a good villain, looking like a cross between Mitt Romney and Robert Vaughan. Tom Wilkinson has a rather pointless guest appearance, still he's the type of solid character actor that lends class and durability to anything, and it's good to see him.<br /><br />Director Brad Bird, best known for his excellent work for Pixar, makes his live action directorial debut. He comes out with all the visual stops and delivers where previous directors (De Palma, Woo, Abrahms) failed in the past, stunts and action carry this picture, not computer graphics. Just look at the incredible, breathless thrills of Cruise climbing up the side of the Giorgio Armani Hotel Dubai, no stuntmen where used, no CGI cheats, that is Tom Cruise risking his life for the enjoyment of a paying audience. Electrifying editing by Paul Hirsch, who's credits include [[ASIN:B00003CXCT Star Wars Trilogy (A New Hope / The Empire Strikes Back / Return of the Jedi) (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc)]] and nearly all of Brian De Palma's films, and exhilarating cinematography from Robert Elswit keep the pace and visuals steadfast and exuberant.<br /><br />I left this movie feeling joyed in the same way the best James Bond films or Indiana Jones adventures have left me feeling in the past. The only obvious fault I can find is that the plot is a tad bit overly familiar, but by being the fourth in a franchise it would seem only natural. This is a step up from the usual big budget blockbusters Hollywood dumps on the unsuspecting moviegoers around the holidays (it was originally released around Christmas). I saw this with my father and sister, which I have to be honest, they did not find it as stimulating as I did. While their reaction was positive, it wasn't as overtly enthusiastic as mine was. I will look forward to the next entry in the series, a first for me and like the recent Fast and the Furious movies and Resident Evil, maybe this franchise has found it's footing once more.

1594203334|1.0|As other reviewers have said, this book capitalizes on the fact that it may be selling you the secret to bringing up perfect kids. Naturally, as a new parent I was intrigued and somewhat taken in by the promise of being able to get my baby to sleep through the night. If you've read the book, you'll know that there's no help in that area whatsoever. Furthermore, the idea that French parents just tell their babies to sleep through the night, expect it to happen and - voila! - it does, is just nonsense.<br /><br />I put this book down when the author described how a friend came to visit and miraculously cured her child from pulling books off the bookshelf onto the floor. The friend stopped the child and explained \\"no, we don't do that\\" and showed the child how to put them back. Honestly, if you need someone to tell you that as a parent, as the author did, then yes, maybe this book is for you. But for heaven's sake, where's the author's common sense?<br /><br />My parents live in France. I have spent many years there and I can tell you from my observations, the French do not hold the key to bringing up well behaved children. If any of them do, it's just plain common sense, which some people in other countries have too!

B0040JHL5O|5.0|I bought these for my 15 year old son - who happens to have Type 1 Diabetes and flat feet.  It's hard to find a running shoe with good arch support that doesn't rub blisters on his arches.  This shoe is perfect!  From day one they were very comfortable (not stiff as mentioned in other reviews), extremely lightweight and NO BLISTERS! The White/Black/Silver/Slam color is nice (the shoe is light gray, not white) and they run true to size.  This is his first pair of Brooks, but certainly will not be his last.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I purchased the book I had no idea what I was getting myself into. It hooked me from the very beginning and I couldn't put it down. It was sweet, almost innocent in the naughty parts. I'm not a prude and yet a lot of the story gave me a small startle as to just what I was reading. Now, I may not be able to find a series of books that will want me to read more. I only wish I could lend it to someone...I couldn't stop telling her how she HAS to read it/them!

1592642195|5.0|Spoiler Alert: I got this book because I like books set in Ireland, and the synopsis sounded interesting. I was not expecting to be so profoundly touched by the plot. It will stay with me for a long time. I know it sounds trite, but this book was one of very few I have ever read that had me laughing out loud at Jamie's neighbor Rose or various antics going on in the character's lives, and then sobbing with emotion when it described Jamie's sweet adoption story and his later deep sadness, knowing what he had endured as a child. I have to disagree with reviewers who said the ending was bad or not positive. I thought it was the very best possible ending, and was extremely happy to see it turn out the way it did. After all, Jamie wasn't necessarily wanting a wife; he was wanting love, connection, and an end to his lonely, hopeless existence. Lydia and her truth was just what he needed. Plus, it hinted at another possible love interest for him in the future, leaving his story open-ended and full of hope.Extremely touching and well-written, I would recommend this book highly.

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Throughout the first couple of chapters, my mouth dropped like it did in Fifty Shades of Grey. I found myself reading, reading and couldn't stop reading. There are areas in the book that will remind you (even exact wording) of Fifty, but I thought it had it's differences, too. It's a long few months before Deeper In You comes out in October, but I'm looking forward to rereading this book again in anticipation of the sequel!

006197806X|2.0|I have to admit I was disappointed by PANDEMONIUM.  BEFORE I FALL and DELIRIUM were such amazing books that I could not wait to get my hands on this one, but I thought it fell flat compared to the other two.  There is a certain magic in Lauren Oliver's writing that I just didn't see in this book--her prose is beautiful, but in this book it came off as almost preachy.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />I won't mention BEFORE I FALL because it is such a different type of story, but I thought PANDEMONIUM really was missing the magic of DELIRIUM.  In DELIRIUM, I really felt Lena's issues with society, her immersion in this strange distopian culture, and I thought the growing love between her and Alex was palpable.  Alex never teaches her how to love, he accompanies her while she learns what it is like.  I really thought the message was quite unique: the book of SHH is right--love does make you crazy!  But it is a craziness that you should be unwilling to live without.<br /><br />In PANDEMONIUM, I felt nothing for Julian at all.  This could be because the roles are reversed and Lena is now the instructor, and we can't get inside Julian's head, but I really felt that Julian was a very sterile character.  Lena seems to love him because he is there, and because he has a nice back--honestly, that's the first moment in the book where I actually felt Julian was Lena's age.  Earlier on, he was 12 or 13 to me, although I knew from the text that he was older.  This same sterility goes for his request for Lena to \\"show him what it's like\\" with a kiss--there was no passion, in my opinion, in his request.<br /><br />Finally, Alex.  I have to admit that I read a spoiler before I read the book, and I knew Alex was coming back.  When I got to the last page I realized how late in the game he does return, but I was fine with it, and ready to see my favorite character (and perhaps some of the passion) come back in the next book.  What I saw was just...disheartening.  First, it's impossible to know what Alex has gone through, so obviously his words and thoughts are coming from a very dark place.  But did he not almost die in order to give Lena the chance to live and love?  His burst of \\"don't believe her, she's a liar\\" was just...unnecessary.  No one who loves someone else believes that they are capable of throwing them to the side without an explanation.  If he realizes that Lena thought him dead, he's just being stupidly cruel.  If he doesn't realize that, well...okay, I guess I'm interested.<br /><br />I will read the next book in the series because I love Lauren Oliver's work before this, but I hate that this book was missing the magic.  I sobbed at the end of both BEFORE I FALL and DELIRIUM because of the beautiful way the book came full-circle (the only other author i know who does this is John Irving), but this one didn't do this for me at all--i found myself skipping over endless description, trying to get to the scenes that never came.

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|It has been a really long time since I've read the original Cinderella story, but I've always loved the various book and movie incarnations of it. When I first read the blurb for this book I thought, what could be more brilliant than a cyborg Cinderella, living in a dystopian world, with an impending intergalactic war? Um, nothing! Oh my goodness, this book was completely wonderful and insane.<br /><br />I loved New Bejing and Marissa Meyer did an amazing job at building this world and making it feel like a real place. The market, the palace, Dr. Erland's office and the quarantine warehouse were all described in such a way that I felt like I was standing in them with the characters, even when they weren't very pleasant places to be. I also really liked the droids that were always around for various things. I've always thought it would be pretty cool to have robots around to do things for us, but these droids had personalities and some of them even seemed to have connections with people. That was so much cooler than regular old robots.<br /><br />Now let's talk about Cinder. She was fantastic! So self-depricating and yet, so determined. I liked that we weren't reading the whole story from inside her head, it definitely felt more like a fairytale that way and then we also got to have scenes with some of the other characters when she wasn't around. I thought it might be weird with her cyborg attributes, but it was so easy to fall into and eventually you just feel like she is a regular person. No matter how much more than regular she turns out to be. I am the biggest fan of her droid Iko. Everytime she was around she made me chuckle and I loved the relationship she had with Cinder. They had such a comraderie and even though she had to obey Cinder's evil stepmother, she would be there for Cinder as far as she could. I know you aren't supposed to like the stepmother in this story and Adri was no different. She was so infuriating and I just wanted to reach into the book and smack her. Prince Kai, on the other hand, I wanted to reach into the book and snuggle. He was just so charming and nothing like you would expect a prince to be. From the very beginning he treated Cinder as someone worthy of his time. He may not have known she was a cyborg, but she was still technically beneath him and he never once let that stop him from seeing her. And the tension! I'm glad this isn't an instant love situation, especially since we have a few more books to look forward to, but I just wanted to scream at them to kiss already! Ugh!<br /><br />The story definitely has a slow build to it, we get to gather a lot of information about the characters and the way things in their world work, before we really get into the conflicts of the story. The whole book was fantastic, but those last few chapters were just, wow! Some of the things that happened were a bit predictable, given that it is a take on a well known fairytale, but it didn't matter at all because it was such a fun ride getting there and her final delivery packed a nice bit of wallop. I am so excited to find out what is going to happen next in this wonderful series, I'm sure Marissa Meyer has more than a few surprises up her sleeve for us.

B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Well, haters, I was once like you. I was appalled at the story. How could the Phantom and Christine have a son!? That just doesn't work! It even says so in \\"Down Once More\\"<br /><br />But after watching interview with ALW and the London cast I realized how much respect they had for the first one. I mean the first one is Webber's baby! He must have had good intentions when writing this. I went on youtube and found a recording of the London cast with Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess(love them both). I had such mixed feelings about it; gorgeous music? Check. Great acting? Check. Oddly great story line? Check...<br />After watching it again, I became obsessed!<br />How!? I hated the idea of it so much!<br /><br />You have to go into it with an open mind my friends. I have found it to be a more \\"what if?\\" kind of story. Keep Phantom of the Opera, Phantom of the Opera. And keep Love Never Dies, Love Never Dies. Don't try to make them one.<br /><br />As for the Aussie version. It's great! I prefer the voices of Ramin and Sierra, over Ben and Ana. But the over all staging of this one is much better. There are a few re-writes in this one I'm not as fond of; I preferred Meg coming back at the end rather than Raoul. I don't like the word re-writes in \\"Beneath a Moonless Sky\\" as much either. That's all personal opinion though.<br /><br />Andrew Lloyd Webber has said that this might be one of his best scores. I'm a MAJOR Phan, and I truly believe that if you go into this with the right mind set you'll truly enjoy it.

0061122416|5.0|I picked up this book in a whim as I was shopping at Target. Never did I think this book would inspire me to follow my dreams. I'm back in school because of this book.<br /><br />I though the story was nice and easy to follow. It's a very poetic book with lots of wisdom. The journey the boy takes is a journey we all wish to take at times but never have the courage to do anything about it.<br /><br />Anyway, I think the book is well written, simple, and an imaginative read. I would re-read it over and over. Definitely worth the time!
1451648537|5.0|So what can I add to this discussion of one of the most well-loved people of our time?  Well I suppose the thing that I keep coming back to is not the life Steve Jobs lived, but more the lessons he learned.  I have come back to this book over and over again to re-read sections on how he learned from his mistakes - even though he may have been reluctant to admit them.<br /><br />Steve Jobs was in many ways the polar opposite of myself.  So I take from this book ways of re-thinking my current position in my company and career.  In this regard, Walter Isaacson has written a book for the ages.  Steve's attention to detail, while maintaining a larger picture.  The ways he would start at 'no' and work to 'yes'.  The ways he would always push for what he thought was right regardless of the opposition.  I hope I can learn from and apply some of these lessons in my career.<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this book.  It should be added as a 'must read' to all college management courses.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack White is getting to be the Johnny Depp of the music world:  he's in just about everything, and most of it's really cool in a way that only lightly rubs shoulders with the mainstream.  After The White Stripes, a James Bond theme (duetting with Norah Jones), The Raconteurs, The Dead Weather, and that concept album with Dangermouse (\\"Rome\\"), we shouldn't be surprised he took this long to do his own album.<br /><br />And Blunderbuss is very much Jack White's own album.  It has a lot of the trademark sound you've heard in his other work, but for Blunderbuss, White seems to pull it all together into his own thing.  White says the songs on Blunderbuss, \\"...had nothing to do with anyone or anything else but my own expression, my own colors on my own canvas\\", but fans of his work will still find that canvas stretched over a very familiar frame.  When the sound wanders into White Stripes territory (\\"Missing Pieces\\", \\"Sixteen Saltines\\"), it's not as washed out on the high end.  Guitars have the same crunch, but not as much noise, distortion, and general knocking around as The Dead Weather.<br /><br />Jack White recorded these songs in his Third Man studio in Nashville, Tennessee, so there's a bit more of a country and blues cast to them:  just about every song is dark and sad.  \\"On and On and On\\" is dark and countrified, with slide guitar and soft organ notes walking us across a laid-back percussion line that hisses below the surface.  \\"Love Interruption\\" is an odd track, with lyrics like \\"I want love to/roll me over slowly/stick a knife inside me/and twist me all around.\\"  \\"Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy\\" is very much a Raconteurs-by-way-of-Rocky-Raccoon song, with jangling piano and bouncing folk-country strings and percussion.  \\"Weep Themselves to Sleep\\" charges forward on a wave of piano reminiscent of \\"Carolina Drama\\" (the Raconteurs), and \\"Freedom at 21\\" has an odd disjointed beat that seems to lie somewhere between Korn and Primus...but the painful lyrics still sound very much like a Jack White song.<br /><br />If you're already a fan of Jack White, you won't be disappointed with Blunderbuss.  If you're not familiar with his work, this one is the art album, and while it won't have as much pop appeal, it is musically very rich.  I suggest you start here, then if you like the guitar-heavy parts go back to The White Stripes, and if you prefer the folk/country/blues aspects look into The Raconteurs.  Either way, don't give Blunderbuss a miss.y much like a Jack White song.<br /><br />If you're already a fan of Jack White, you won't be disappointed with Blunderbuss.

0894803123|4.0|I personally am not the biggest fan of ice cream bases where the egg isn't cooked, but sometimes I turn the other cheek because it's good ice cream. This is one of those cases. When my boyfriend gets an idea to make ice cream, this is the cookbook he head for---he is lazy otherwise.<br /><br />I can attest that the chocolate and strawberry are amazing---as is the Cherry Garcia and others.<br /><br />I think of all the ice cream books out there---this is the best for people who have a general interest. It's easy and it always yields great results.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this entire series, although Book 1 was the best of the 3.  I highly recommend it, even for adults.  I found the 3rd book in the series to be the weakest, but still very good.  Not sure I would recommend the series for kids under 13 as a lot of the material is somewhat graphic and violent.  But you have to know your kid to know what they can handle.  I read it in about 2 days, so it is a quick easy read.  Enjoy!

Don't know which one I prefer. If you have seen the episode of HIMYM you'll know what kind of stuff to expect. This book has over 75 different plays and advice.<br />This book is funny from the very start and is such a fun read...if you liked the Bro Code then you'll love this as this is, in my opinion, the better book. A must buy for HIMYM fans like me.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book caused me to write my first review because I enjoyed it so much and wanted to share my experience. The way that it was written and how it pulls you in to the story is startling. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. How the father and mother each in their own way lived with and endured the consequences of their son's life is truly a testament to what each of them were going through. Poignantly written, not contrived at all. Take a chance and do yourself a favor-- read it! You won't be disappointed.  The author seems to have a keen ability to tell a story that you can easily understand and at the same time feel empathy for the characters.
B007X15GRQ|2.0|I was excited to watch Contraband because of the unique subject matter, but the plot wasn't very twisty or unique, and there were few surprises. Felt like a long TV episode rather than a taut thriller.

B00337KM2S|5.0|This movie is hands down my favorite movie ever. Starting with George Clooney, arguably one of the best actors we have right now, and continuing with the rest of this solid cast, and the storyline which I'm still trying to completely figure out, this movie is a true gem.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham (Clooney) goes through life flying from one destination to another, firing people along the way. He's happy, he's content, he's at peace - until a series of disconcerting and unfamiliar events turn his world upside down. As a minimalist and a single middle-aged male, I identify with this character in a very strong way. I also love flying (and airports!) and I also practice a life of non-attachment and personal freedom. I loved his musings about \\"What's in your backpack?\\" and his ideas on letting go of possessions and attachments. He's good, he's on a path, he has a number in mind, he just hasn't hit it yet. But he has no idea what *will* hit him next.<br /><br />This film is full of nuances and little plot developments and phrases that you will remember later in the story and go \\"ahhh, that's what he meant!\\". Every time I see it (yes, I've seen it several times), I catch something I hadn't noticed before. This film is for thinkers, because you cannot see it and not think and ponder and analyze everything that happens and how the characters were profoundly changed. Again, I cannot say enough good things about this film, and every actor in it are cast just right. If you haven't seen it, I assure you, you want to see it!

B0059XTUVI|4.0|I personally knew very little of Margaret Thatcher going into this film.  I remembered seeing her on the news quite a bit during the 80's but beyond that she seemed to vanish from the media in the years after her tenure as Prime Minister.  So, I went into this movie open-minded and without any bias towards her actual life versus this film.  I can say that Meryl Streep is amazing and brings to life many of the memories I do have of Thatcher and her mannerisms.  Streep plays the hard-nosed conservative tough but with the tender delicacies of a proper and ladylike woman as well.  But, do not overlook the performance of Alexandra Roach.  I found her role of the young Margaret at times to be equally sympathetic, even as much as Streep's.  Her surefooted tone of defiance in the face of status quo womanhood are among the best scenes in the film.<br /><br />The movie relies heavily upon not only Thatcher's background in politics, but also her unspoken thoughts of her family - which could be among the highest of conjecture - but still was quite moving.  Her relationship with her husband is among the keys to how this film decided to disect the motives of Thatcher.<br /><br />I found the historical references during her times as PM to be among the most grounded, yet those parts move by quite quickly and lead us back to her internal struggles.  Though the external nature of such a high political position is usually shown equal to the internal, here it seems more dilluted.  I would've preferred to see more of the head of state to state sit downs, international political maneuvering.<br /><br />In the end the film does strike a good balance of showing her as a triumphant giant among men, yet also the humanistic reflection of everyday people.  This film would be very interesting for those that enjoy biographical films, historical time pieces, and political dramas.  I enjoyed this film a lot more than what I expected and what other reviewers had mentioned of it.<br /><br />Streep's performance alone is enough to say this is definitely worth renting, if not buying.performance alone is enough to say this is definitely worth renting, if not buying.

B005LAIGP0|5.0|This movie is a good old fashioned ghost story.  If you are into blood, gore and horror, this is not your movie.  If you love the old hitchcock and tales from the crypt-type shows, this is the one for you.  Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) had lost his wife during childbirth a few years prior.  He must leave his child behind with a nanny in order to sort out a deceased client's copious amount of paperwork at her house.  The house and grounds are haunted by the deceased.  The fury of losing her young child while she was living remains with her in death; so she wreaks vengeance on the community as a ghost.<br /><br />The acting is superb and the effects are chilling.  I was so excited that they gave Daniel Radcliffe a chance to break free of the Harry Potter mold...and boy did he ever deliver.  Wonderfully done.  I highly recommend it.  Caution with children under the age of 13 due to disturbing images and intense creepiness.
1449305172|5.0|Bought the kindle edition and loved it. Been following Ash's blog for a bit and also the lean movement so I knew a little about the subject matter.

Great lessons about love, loss, survival, and taking control of your own life.  Much better than The Notebook and The Vow, in my opinion.  I highly recommend it.

B005G4TJUC|2.0|I recorded this movie from freebie I got from dishNetwork and wow  what a let down,  Acting has really takening a nose drive on this one. Way to many actors in it many of them were flat out goofy and love interest has way to much collagen in her lips makes her look like she has a hockey puck in them and she came across as blond bimbo.  Dialogs,talking was to fast and hard to follow way to much mumbling and confusion going on. Makes me glad I did not shell out some cash for see this dog. Hasbro should be ashamed to have their name link to it.  Lastly hang on to your money  you will find it at here or at some other Online store for less than price of a movie ticket.

Lola and Sam are likable and it is fun to follow their friendship and the beginnings of romance through a lost phone.

0345803485|1.0|I believe the premise for this story is fabricated and does NOT represent women as a whole...making it very difficult to buy into the storyline. Submissive in the bedroom behavior...is being stretched to beyond acceotable here. And, further, i feel this story has the ability to desensitize people what would otherwise be called ABUSE. Men who read this can be tempted into desiring this form of power over women. The storyline, after the premise, is shallow... I had to stop after chapter five... I did noteven find the sex scenes long enough to stimulate sufficiently.  I don't know why all the hooplala over this book, except maybe that the male promoters and reviewers have an alterior motive to promote this behavior and move our culture to further accept this type of deviance.
B007WV05GY|1.0|Liam Neeson is easily one of the best actors of the current generation.  The grey is a good movie, WITH good acting but the ENDING was horrible.  There were so many other possibilities for the end and they had to leave as they did.<br /><br />I am upset that I invested $15 and 2 hours in the movie to see a good story develop and then slip away right before your eyes.  This movie is worth seeing when it is on a non-paid cable network in 9 months or so.

1439156816|3.0|Stephen King is a very admirable writer and is influential to me. This book is a terrific source for people who want to improve their writing capabilities. The reason I give it a three out of five is because I read it in a Kindle version.<br />If you are planning (or just thinking about) buying the Kindle version, I suggest you pay extra shipping for a real copy--or get a used one for cheaper--because THIS BOOK IS NOT GOOD FOR READING ON A KINDLE. As I read it (I used it for a report in school), I constantly regretted buying the Kindle version because as good of a book it is, my opinion is that it is easier to read if you leaf through it. On a Kindle you can only go page to page or use a table of contents with shortcuts to chapters, but I'm pretty sure this one didn't have one. I would have to go page to page to skip to different information for my report. I would rather have it as a book I can pick up, go to a random page, go to another random page, put different pages together, etc., etc. On a Kindle it's not that type of book, so if you buy it on Kindle, plan on reading the whole thing cover to cover.<br />As far as content, it's great. I recommend it...but only in a hard copy edition.

I don't think it matters what kind of metal you like this is a must have.In a time where so many arstist sound so much alike this album is a breathe of fresh air.In one word I would describe this as different. It is dark ,heavy and fast.Sludge Metal,djent,death metal,math metal,proggressive metal and jazz metal can all be used to paint a picture of this albums landscape.From one of the most influential metal bands of this era come another hard hitting and definitive piece of music that will not disappoint.If you have never heard Meshuggah the songs throught their new cd are quite varied enough I can call this a great place to start,and for old fans a great place to finish.

B007IE4DSG|5.0|Remarkable outtakes from George Harrison's early solo career. Like the recent Bob Dylan Bootleg series - one can easily make the argument that these songs in their rawest form; are as good or better than the finished product. This will put to rest any notion that \\"All Things Must Past\\" was successful due to Phil Spector's grand wall of sound.  These songs as presented here in their \\"infancy\\" are brilliant. Highly recommended.  And to the reviewer who is unhappy that there are too few songs - please - just because you can put a lot of music on a disk - doesn't mean you should.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I purchased this for myself with the intent of passing on to my son as he gets older. Even in my late 20s I remain a big fan of LEGO. This has been the largest kit I have tackled. I almost was caught unprepared when the box arrived. The kit took me roughly 12 hours (over the course of 3 days with about 4 hours a night) to build.<br /><br />Price wise, it is right on cue with every other LEGO kit out there. Most kits around 1000 pieces run around $100 dollars. The Death Star has just under 4000 pieces in it.<br /><br />LEGO put a lot of effort in the details into this kit. Every room has plenty of moving parts. There are a bunch of tiny little details that when you spot them, it just amazes you. Especially as a Star Wars fan too. My biggest complaint is that I really wish LEGO would use more printed parts instead of stickers.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase. It was well worth the price of entry. Had a great time building it. Worst part of the build is that sometimes on the instructions it is hard to tell if it is suppose to be a dark gray or a black piece. There were a few instances that I had to go undo a few steps because I realized I had put one or the other in the wrong spot. but that is a minor detail to me that didn't truly affect my overall opinion of the kit. That isn't something exclusive to just this one. And I personally found having the large instruction book that is spiral bound to be awesome. Now I just need to find a place to put it, because let's face it that was the whole point in purchasing it.

B007Z9RAX4|4.0|The fight scenes were actually realistic. You know Gina can fight in real life, so you don't have that \\"she can't do that\\" thing going. Three Hollywood A listers and a bonifide female action star. Gina's acting wasn't bad. It wasn't great either, but this is her first film. And I'm assuming she's had zero acting experience. And the fight scene with young Magnito was awesome! Worth the rent, worth the theater, worth buying as well.

B005MYWZIO|5.0|Michael Kiwanuka's full-length debut \\"Home Again\\" is one of those rare albums that get better each time you listen to it. It has a timeless appeal much like Ray LaMontagne's solo work, but leaning more toward the classic soul sound of the early 1970's. Highly recommended.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|The product itself is REALLY light and sometimes I don't realize it's in my bag.  The casing seems like it's made of cheap plastic, but it hasn't cracked yet.
B007Z9Q97M|5.0|A present day and a 100 years old double murder, family feuds, greed, forbidden love, gourmet truffles and two grandfathers who want peace and love in their families...aaanndd Caroline and Max are back!!! Just can't beat a Bones episode!!!
