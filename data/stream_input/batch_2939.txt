B000W93CHC|5.0|This last book in the trilogy continues to deliver, containing intricate and amazing details of what life was like in the Middle Ages. Follett's large cast of characters are so well developed that the reader cannot help but become enveloped in their lives. You root for the 'good' guys while taking great satisfaction when the 'bad guys' get their due. I found myself feeling outraged by the actions of those who are supposed to be men of God, some of which were as unGodly as the devil. They are priests, monks, bishops etc., with pious attitudes and excuses for all they do, justifying their actions by claiming and actually convincing themselves they can do no wrong, because everything they do MUST be God's will, otherwise the opportunities - for whatever - would not even present themselves. Some are murderers, they plot revenge, commit adultery, and are as ambitious as any snake-in-grass politician alive today. Follett's trilogy awakened in me an acute awareness that though the physical world in which we live today has changed dramatically, human nature has essentially stayed the same. Some good, some bad and everything in between. Follett's writing is extremely graphic, many times extremely gory, with vivid descriptions of death, dying, blood and guts, literally.<br /><br />Whole families living in one room houses (if they were lucky to have a house at all), sleeping on the floor side by side. Peasants having sex under the covers in a room full of other sleeping families because they were homeless, an accepted way of living - very few choices to be made if one was poor. Of course I realize these are novels, but they give pause for thought about then vs now, the vast differences in circumstances, while people themselves remain glaringly the same. His books are very, very, long - but I never thought once about not seeing them through to the end. Amen.

B00ARF93AQ|1.0|I'm not sure who thought this was a good idea but this movie was bad. It has really bad graphics for a movie that is supposed to take place in the future. I watched for as long as I could and then turned it off.

1439181780|5.0|This book is easy to read and has great summaries at the end of each chapter that capture the key takeaways.  It is that book you can give to a friend or coworker that is having some kind of challenge in life and it will help them find a way to turn the challenge into an opportunity.  I will definitely be rereading this book many times and keeping a copy close by for my team members too.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Was late to the 'ebay' game, but I am really enjoying the looking, the saving, and<br />the buying.  Having it accessible is very nice.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|great show that was canceled in the second season.  would love to see another season or two of this show.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is my first review ever for any kind fo a product, so lets begin.<br /><br />First of all i have been using this headset for almoust a year.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I will start with one major and the reason i rated 4 not 5 stars. Sound drops are annoying as hell. They dont appear always but when they do its impossible to game or listen music, sound just dissapears/drops and after couple of seconds appears again and then agai afyter few seconds dissapears. No solution has worked for me even tho they kinda are some ways to fix it.<br /><br />The comnfort isnt the best either but it isnt big issue for me. Icant paly all day with these headsets on, few hours and i need a break. Padding isnt the softest.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Sound is great, batery life is arround 10 hours and even after it starts beeping (low battery) it can hold almoust 2 hours so i would say not bad. Offcoruse there are headsets with better battery life.<br /><br />Not too heavy for me either, feels comfortable. Metal inside plastic frame makes the headet more durable and it doesnt brake if you strech the headset too much :D.<br /><br />Easy to turn off/on the headeet anbd regulate the volume.<br /><br />So thats it for now. Sounds stupoid but i havent use a mic yet because i havent spoke to anyone :D so i cant speak about that.<br />Logitech hasnt dissapointed me yet, looking forward to their products.
B000SW2F80|5.0|Just kidding, but I hope George Romero & Stephen King take the hint! This is one of my very favorite movies. I don't know how many times I've watched it, but I know most of the dialog. This blu ray copy is sharper looking than my trusty dvd, but the film could still use a facelift (Hey George, how 'bout a 3D version!?). The extras are nonexistent (just the trailer), so I would love to see any behind the scenes footage and interviews in future releases. All that said: if you're a fan of either Romero or King, you've gotta get this disc!
B00594XOZU|1.0|it would not let me purchase it<br />and when it did I was horrible I wish I never got it sucks
B00003CX9W|5.0|Over a thirty year period I have seen Fantasia (1940) in theaters on a few occasions. During each showing I witnessed several members of the audience walk out. That is usually a good sign. There is little doubt that this experimental film (yes, Disney once was innovative) has unmitigated moments of lurid kitsch, with equal parts cinematic magic. It's a flawed masterpiece, which begs the questions: does an infallible masterpiece actually exist? Fantasia represents it's creator, Walt Disney, as utterly possessed by obsessive, artistic, and innovative ambition. It may be one of the most stand apart films ever crafted, which is why, seventy plus years later, it still has the power to provoke dumbed-down audiences who still look at artmusic with suspicion. Simultaneously, it also annoys insufferable academic elitists who cannot find it in themselves to embrace the film's tawdrier moments.<br /><br />Another supposed \\"strike\\" the film has against it is its choice of conductor: Leopold Stokowski. Stoki was the P.T. Barnum of transplanted Euro conductors residing in America. Mention him to any \\"serious\\" classical music lover and he'll make a face like he's heard fingernails scraping down a chalkboard. Stokowski was known for his Bach transcriptions, one of which--\\"Toccata and Fugue in D minor\\"--opens the film. Essentially,he romanticized Bach, making him sound more like Tchaikovsky. One wit described such tampering as \\"High Cholesterol Bach.\\" It's a dishonest reaction, molded by unimaginative attachments to \\"historical correctness\\" and hyper-realism. Avoid such persons like the plague (they probably started life by pulling the wings off butterflies). For those of us who have no qualms admitting that we like plenty of syrup on our musical flapjacks, embracing this wizard's transcriptions presents no problems. Seeing only Stokowski's brazen self-promotion amounts to blindness. This former organist had one of the most prodigious gifts in drawing color out of every orchestra he worked with, which made him the quintessential choice for Fantasia. Compare his achievement in this film, awash in personality, to the comparatively monochromatic conducting of James Levine in Fantasia 2000.<br /><br />The meeting of Stokowski and Walt Disney, in 1937 at Chasen's restaurant, is the stuff of legend. Disney was starstruck with the conductor's celebrity, mysterious accent, and fierce mane. The seed of an idea for a \\"concert film\\" sprang from the meeting. At this time Disney had only produced and released one previous feature: Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs (1937). The idea of an animated feature had seemed risky and radical, with the naysayers predicting bankruptcy. The profits and critical acclaim from Snow White forever silenced those constipated doomsday prophets. Now, Disney was ready to take another risk. 1940 saw the release of Disney's second and third feature films. Artistically, it paid off as Pinocchio (1940) and Fantasia are, to date, Disney's two greatest films (yes, I said that), released only nine months apart. The former was a critical, box office hit. The latter did not make money for nearly twenty years. Disney had proven one can go indeed broke overestimating the American public.<br /><br />The Fantasia deal signed, Stokowski was excited and predictably offered numerous ideas about the use of color. A later biographer wrote that the conductor's fascination with color was sincere, describing his various experiments with mixing alcoholic drinks for color effects. Stoki did a similar thing with \\"sound color\\" by incessantly changing the orchestra seating layout. Even visually, \\"Toccata and Fugue\\" is pure Stokowski. The opening piece is introduced via the superb narration of American composer Deems Taylor (to the public he was primarily known as a commentator for the NY Philharmonic Radio Broadcasts). This \\"absolute music\\" is total abstraction. Entirely hand painted, at times the watercolors almost appear to still be wet. Vibrant with texture, this is far removed from contemporary slick and soulless computer animation. Stokowski used no baton, so his beautifully powerful long hands are highlighted, jabbing through the splashing backdrop. The french horns are hauntingly lit in diaphanous color before the violin bows transform into silvery beams of light reaching for infinity. Sound and vision collide, producing crashing tides, ending in a literal fireworks display.<br /><br />For those, like myself, who have overdosed on Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker Suite,\\" Fantasia serves up a refreshing alternate vision, the most incandescent and sensual vignette of the entire program. Naturally, it is abridged and rearranged like one of Stoki's infamous \\"Symphonic Syntheses.\\" Unwittingly, Disney tailored this Nutcracker Suite for the upcoming hippie acidhead generation (who eventually elevated Fantasia to masterpiece status). Darting fairies, spectral spider webs, and psychedelic mushrooms are followed by larger, dew-shaking `shrooms engaged in a Chinese tango. Being a ballet, naturally there is plenty of dancing, but the Disney team imaginatively improve on the yawn-inducing holiday imagery that we have come to associate with Tchaikovsky's most famous music (which, as Taylor reminds us, the composer himself detested). Guaranteed, you will not find blue fairies, Russian Cossacks, pink fairies, waltzing flowers, orange fairies, or rhythmic goldfish mating with fairies (?) and swimming through an erotic Busby Berkeleyesque aquatic Arabic dance sequence at your local ballet company anytime soon.<br /><br />Paul Dukas' The Sorcerer's Apprentice is justifiably Fantasia`s most famous segment. Having a narrative (albeit a wordless one) to work with inspired the team to great heights. It is possibly the last time we will see Mickey Mouse before he succumbs to total blandness.With its narrative of white magic and sorcery, it is remarkable that the evangelical zealots of the day did not hone in on this segment (the way they did more recently with the Harry Potter series). It's either that such types are somehow even more de-evolved than they were seventy years ago (possible, but not likely) or they stayed away from anything with the tag of \\"classical music\\" attached anyway. Since they didn't see it, they didn't know to get their feathers riled. Regardless, Stokowski had no such qualms. This being a tone poem, it is tailored for his bag of tricks. Even the most art-constipated among us can enjoy our once favorite mouse in the expert choreography composed by the Disney team.<br /><br />Igor Stravinsky's ballet \\"Le Sacre du printemps\\" (\\"The Rite of Spring\\") is served up here for the eternal dinosaur-loving eight-year-old boy. Actually, the ballet is about pagan sacrifice and is so dissonant and barbaric that it caused one of the biggest scandals of music history in the form of a violent riot during the 1913 premiere at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees. Regardless of the ballet's narrative change (and the necessary abridgment), the composer (the only living composer chosen for the film) at first loved the Disney/Stokowski version. Years later, he did an about face (as he was apt to do), vilifying it. Still, given the time, the Darwinism included here was a damned provocative decision. This was only fifteen years after the Scopes trial, yet Disney and team are showing us the beginning of life on earth as science has revealed. Fish mutating into amphibious lifeforms show the artists clearly siding with Scopes and Clarance Darrow. Naturally, the dinosaurs come, and no Creation Museum is going to stop them. While the Le Sacre du Printemps (2004) film by the tragically short-lived Oliver Herrmann might be aesthetically truer to the avant-garde nature of Stravinsky's masterpiece, Fantasia`s interpretation is rousing (and exhausting). After carnivorous lizards and the extinction of much life on earth, we deserve an amusing intermission with the soundtrack and, again Taylor is the host for the job.<br /><br />Fantasia`s treatment of Beethoven's \\"Pastorale\\" symphony has always been a point of debate. Skinny dipping centaurettes are lured (by mooning cherubs) to square jawed, beefcake centaurs. Fortunately, the centaurettes do manage to squeeze into their garland bras because their male counterparts don't seem to know what to do next. Confused libidos and a bacchanal (where the wine is pouring) is rudely interrupted by none other than Zeus himself (wielding a lightening bolt forged by Vulcan). This is the famous \\"storm\\" movement of the Pastorale. Helios' chariot brings forth a much-needed sunset, and Selene tucks the Earth in with the night of her cape. Stokowski's reading, like Disney's animation, is anything but subtle.<br /><br />Ponichelli's ballet \\"Dance of the Hours\\" (from the opera \\"La Gioconda\\") becomes what may be the most eccentric burlesque in the history of cinema. This is also a highly debated segment, which is to be expected with an amorous alligator cavorting with a hippo, alligators riding ostriches, and elephants riding alligators. Perhaps the Fantaisa-loving acid heads of the 1960s had a point.<br /><br />Mussorgsky's \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" was part of Stokowski's standard repertoire. He has his own arrangement, as opposed to the Rimsky-Korsakov edition used in most concert programs. The Witches' Sabbath brings out the Satanic Chernobog (modeled, in part, on Bela Lugosi and Wilford Jackson), descending on the town below like the Angel of Death terrorizing Egypt in the Moses narrative. Chernobog's demons join their master in this violent, surreal nightmare, which, unfortunately for the victims, features a fiery pit to rival the worst of the gnostic apocalypses. The sadistic, phantasmagoric mayhem retreats with the chiming of the church bells that herald the segue into Schubert's \\"Ave Maria.\\" Some have held these last two conjoined segments as the film's best.<br /><br />Walt Disney had planned more editions of Fantasia (which included a collaboration with Salvador Dali), but its initial failure laid such plans to rest until sixty year later when Walt Disney Productions released Fantasia 2000. Fantasia 2000 had fleeting moments of brilliance, but was mostly a disappointing sequel; too clean, too crisp, lacking the risk-taking intensity and provocativeness of the original. Pinocchio may have had boys turning into jackasses, and Dumbo (1941) had it's mind boggling \\"pink elephants on parade,\\" but Walt Disney's Fantasia is chock-full of progressive weirdness and an ardent embrace of art for the sake of art.<br /><br />*Review originally published at 366 weird moviesid more recently with the Harry Potter series).

B009RX85N0|5.0|I love this show!!!  I love how they explore all the characters and how they intermingle.  I can't wait to see what characters come to life in the next season.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This show is the British equivalent of Breaking Bad when it comes to trying to figure out how it  will end, and whodunit. The writers have done an incredible job of coming up with more plot twists than a pretzel.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Great book! Heart wrenching  to think of the atrocities that the orphans endured at the hands of \\"God fearing\\" people.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was one of the lucky individuals who was able to purchase a Chromecast in the first wave of orders, before they sold out almost immediately. I purchased it mostly out of excitement and curiosity fueled by my love of consumer gadgets. To be perfectly clear, this product fills absolutely no niche that is not already satisfied by either my smart TV or my Xbox 360, both of which are sufficiently capable of playing back content from numerous sources. The best role to which this dongle could reasonably aspire is to perform these same music/video streaming better or more conveniently than my current solutions. I am happy to say that, for the most part, it accomplishes this role. There are a handful of beneficial reasons for which the Chromecast has become, if not my only streaming device, then at least my primary one of choice for most circumstances.<br /><br />First, it is faster. Considering the time it takes my Xbox 360 to start up, load the Netflix app, browse to a particular TV show, switch episodes (because for some silly reason their design team decided to not let users select an episode first), buffer the introduction and play, it is really not surprising that a tiny device from Google is able to reach the same destination much faster. This is partly due to the simple hardware requiring virtually no start-up time once the TV is turned on. It is also partly due to what I perceive as a faster buffering time to start playing (although initially it performed this task relatively slowly, it has improved significantly since the earlier days). It is also partly due to the fact that it doesn't really have to load an app so much as recognize a streaming source online. The final reason for this significantly reduced wait time is directly tied to the second benefit of the Chromecast.<br /><br />Second, selecting content is easier. The Chromecast is designed entirely as a receiver of instructions from a wide variety of other devices. This means you can use your computer, phone, or tablet to select content for playback. Generally speaking, controlling any of these devices, especially a touchscreen phone or tablet, is much faster for searching for and selecting media content. I certainly have a much easier time finding what I want to watch on my Nexus 7 than I ever did on my Xbox 360. This makes the browsing process both faster and less of a hassle. It also means you don't have to hunt for a particular remote to operate the TV or console; whatever you have at hand will probably do the trick.<br /><br />Third, the available media sources better fits my own device catalogue and service preferences. This reason will vary greatly depending on personal tastes, but until now it has been challenging finding a single service that would work ideally for purchasing movies and TV shows. I've used Amazon's Instant Video in the past, which plays nice with both PC and Xbox 360, but sadly there is no Android support and none forthcoming, which rules out playback on my tablet or phone. Since I'm not plugged into the Apple ecosystem iTunes Video is pretty much useless to me. Finally, with the Chromecast I have found a pair of services that work across all my screens with Google Play Video and Google Play Music. With Chromecast, content that before could make it to my desktop, phone, and tablet can finally play back through the TV as well, the final screen in my house that was previously lacking. This has been a huge relief for me, and helped me decide how I wish to purchase new seasons of upcoming shows.<br /><br />There are two obvious downsides to the functionality of Chromecast at the moment. First, the number of primarily supported sources is very limited. Right now it is mostly just Google services (YouTube, Google Play) and Netflix. There are plenty of other content providers who would add a great deal of value to the service, including but certainly not limited to Amazon, Pandora, Spotify, Hulu, and Vimeo. It seems very likely that Google will getthese other content providers onboard in a reasonably short time frame, but it is risky to rely on such future business decisions, and right now the number of options you have for Chromecast is decidedly spartan. Second, sometimes control of playback can be a challenge. It is not always easy to make one's way back to the control app on a given device, meaning urgently pausing a movie is no longer as simple as snatching up the remote or controller in your lap, but unlocking a device and switching back to the proper app.<br /><br />The good news is that, like most Google products, the first couple releases are always large-scale dogfooding among the general populace. It is highly likely that Google will continue to improve the value and functionality of the Chromecast over the coming months, and I for one very much look forward to seeing how they improve the gadget.
B00632HWOG|5.0|All the metals are heavier than the store models.  Everything fits perfectly and was easy to install.  Grills to expectation.  Wish one thing that grate was a little closer to burners.  Love that it was made in USA.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|The app was downloaded by my son onto his Kindle Fire...unfortunately he did not read the reviews first. As the other reviews mention it says not enough space available but even when you delete other apps to make MORE than enough room it won't finish downloading.<br /><br />The worst part is you CAN'T DELETE IT!! It holds your Kindle hostage.
B009EE1GC4|5.0|For myself, that blames India for taking my customer service job, in these changing times, &#34; I loved knowing the way I pictured life in India, was different than this movie&#34; even when the descriptions were the same.. A movie for all.
B008JFUO36|2.0|This movie was boring--plodding at times.<br />Morgan Freeman did his best to overcome a &#34;cold caramel&#34; plod through an (at times ) confusing attempt to cameo Tom Cruise.<br />The ending was the best part---for many reasons.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I don't like it. I have had problems with my email ever since I installed it. I am having trouble combining with gmail.
B005HGKWLO|4.0|This was for the most part a good story about love lost and found again. Although we (husband and yours truly) questioned why these two let things go so far out in left field in the first place before finally trying to set things right.<br /><br />ALERT - SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER: I personally found John Krasinski's character much more attractive, stable and suitable for Jennifer Goodwin's character than that other guy.<br /><br />&#34;Dex&#34; just came  off as a bit of a wimp and didn't fight for the girl he (reportedly) really loved until the eleventh and a half hour...that would have been 'too late' for me.<br /><br />Still, there  are some laughs and deep sighs to be derived and, Kate Hudson shines in her narcissistic character of Darcy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Best book ever :) it's a great read and I  recommend it for anybody who loves zombie books really great book you'll love it trust me
B00EE3FVSU|3.0|I looked high and low for this series based on Emily Nussbaum's recommendation, only to find that it's not much different from other shows. Compared to The Killing it's oh so tame.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I notice when playing this that the game will randomly slow down and speed up like it is lagging or something. Also, I think the hog goes too fast and needs to be slowed down because I'm sure it's not good for your eyes to try to focus on something moving that fast. Otherwise, awesome game!!!!!:-)
1451639155|5.0|I loved this one! It is funnier if you have read all of the earlier books, but it would still have had me laughing out loud if I had not. She has a sly sense of humor that I very much love. It is at its best when she sneaks in just a word or two in a serious passage. I'm less fond of her attempts at being funny in a more blatent way, but in this book, even that works.
B00A5IYC38|3.0|So IMO it's better than Tommy in that it keeps a coherent plot and has some real sense of angst and history and a broader sound track.
1451695195|5.0|I am a physician and can only be amazed at the medical perspective that Dr. Alexander provides to his near death experience. Others have written of similar feelings and experiences, but Dr. Alexander provides a fascinating discussion of how the medical evidence of his brain dysfunction defies the simplistic explanation that his experience could be a dream or hallucination.  Even the non medically inclined will benefit from this book, but if you have a medical background you will be blown away.
B000002ADT|5.0|Great album for the Miles Davis fan or any lover of jazz music. Good quality recording and pressing. Enough said.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I had never heard of this series, but decided to watch since the father is the same actor that plays Mr. Bates on Downton. Love him, love this series!  Watched all four seasons and wish there were more!
B00CRPZXFI|5.0|Sounds perfect, looks great! Is there anything else to say? I guess no. This is the only way to listen to this album!
B000EHQ57Q|5.0|After picking up most of the 5.1 SACD's of the Moody Blues, this recording stands out in sonic quality. Question is a gem as is Melancholy Man. Anyone with SACD capability should add this to thir collection.
B0073COMUW|1.0|Loved the pricing, but the old adage states you get what you pay for - very true here.  The light was so harsh and silivery that I took it out of the living room and placed it outside on the porch lite - where my neighbors (I'm sorry to say) will suffer from its light output.  No, I would not buy this product again - it is subpar, uncompetitive, and NOT ready to replace my CFL's whatsoever. Hopefully someone will take pity on the leftover stock and recycle all remaining items in stock.  Horrid lighting - and you'll regret it if you buy it unless it truly is used in a &#34;utility&#34; role.
B00BT70J7M|5.0|For those of us who deeply admire the artistry of tenor Jonas Kaufmann for his Wagner roles and his recitals of lieder this recording comes with a bit of trepidation. Will this intensely musical artist make the Verdi roles as convincing as he has those of other composers or will he plunge and lurch into the Verdian style of belting we so often encounter in the opera house?<br /><br />Rest assured. Kaufmann is first and foremost a tenor with a magnificently beautiful voice matched by some of the most intensely musical phrasing and arching of lines that rise seamlessly to the heights of emotion and intensity. His first Verdi encounter was with La Traviata in 2006 here in the US and he was praised at that time for his compleat performance. Though some naysayers will state that according to their ears, instead of throaty tone lower in the range, Kaufmann could bring to every note the same Italianate ping that distinguishes his upper extension.<br /><br />All well and good. But even for those who fear these arias may not offer the dignity of what Kaufmann usually sings, listen carefully and see how he brings a new standard of artistry to the warhorses as well as the less well known arias included on this recording. This recording includes 13 tracks:<br />Rigoletto, Atto III, Canzone: \\"La donna e mobile\\" <br />Aida, Atto I, Scena e romanza: \\"Se quel guerrier io fossi!...Celeste Aida\\" <br />Un Ballo in Maschera, Atto I, Canzone: \\"Di' tu se fedele\\"  and Atto III, Scena e romanza: \\"Forse la soglia attinse... Ma se m'e forza perderti\\" <br />Il Trovatore, Parte III, Scena ed aria: \\"Ah! si, ben mio... Di quella pira <br />Luisa Miller, Atto II, Scena ed aria: \\"Oh! fede negar potessi... Quando le sere al placido\\" <br />Simon Boccanegra, Atto II, Scena ed aria: \\"O inferno! Amelia qui!... Sento avvampar nell'anima... Cielo pietoso, rendila\\" <br />Don Carlo, Atto II, Scena e duetto: \\"E lui! desso, l'Infante!... Dio, che nell'alma infondere\\" <br />La Forza del Destino, Atto III, Scena e romanza: \\"La vita e inferno all'infelice...O tu, che in seno agli angeli\\" <br />I Masnadieri, Atto III, Scena 2: \\"Destatevi, o pietre... Giuri ognun questo canuto\\" <br />Otello, Atto III : \\"Dio! mi potevi scagliar\\" and , Atto IV: \\"Niun mi tema\\" <br />Macbeth, Atto IV, Scena ed aria: \\"O figli, o figli miei!... Ah, la paterna mano\\"<br /><br />For example, listen to his excerpt from Aida, \\"Se quell guerrier io fossi! ... Celeste Aida.\\" In the liner notes, he issues a challenge to every tenor who has sung the final B-flat full-out. \\"On no account should this note be blasted out. If tenors none the less do so, this is usually because they are worried that audiences will think that they are crooning or perhaps that they are not sufficiently masculine. This macho complex is unfortunately widespread. Yet such a piano sound requires at least as much power as a tremendous forte, for physically speaking, the singer should be able to turn up the volume at any moment and transform this piano into a forte.\\" Of course, he sings the final note as written. Not only is his diminuendo almost perfect, but he also tapers to a remarkably sweet sound, which he manages to hold through much of the orchestral close. If he can accomplish this feat onstage, he will surely bring down the house.<br /><br />Pier Giorgio Morandi conducts the Orchestra dell'Opera di Parma: Kaufmann deserves better orchestral collaboration than this rather limp accompanimnet. But is all this is a splendid new jewel in Kaufmann's crown. Highly recommended.

B00F35BV64|5.0|This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be, especially after seeing the advertisement on TV. The advertisement on TV left out a lot of important details. Star Trek Into Darkness was a lot better than I thought it would be.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Although I had heard of \\"Les Miserables\\", watching this movie was my first real exposure to it in any form. It was a big mix of good and no so good all around - the acting, the characters, and the story. By the end I definitely felt the movie was too long.<br /><br />The first third of the movie was great. Despite having high expectations after hearing about Anne Hathaway's performance, her scenes still managed to exceed them. \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was by far the highlight of the film. Her performance is really gut-wrenching. The early scenes with Hugh Jackman were very good as well. Perhaps the most entertaining scene was with Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter at the inn.<br /><br />The middle of the film has its moments such as Samantha Barks playing Éponine. However, this is also when I felt things go downhill. I didn't feel any connection to Cosette as an adult (Amanda Seyfried), so I never got overly concerned about her plight. Playing Marius, Eddie Redmayne seemed to have this dumbfounded look on his face most of the time. I didn't care for his character at all and the whole revolution felt more like grown-up kids acting out than anything noble to support. This isn't meant as a knock on the French Revolution, just the way it was portrayed here.<br /><br />When there were panoramic shots, the cinematography was breathtaking. Unfortunately, as many have noted, many of the film was shot with rather exaggerated close-ups. Yes, it's quite impressive that the cast were filmed doing the actually singing - but we don't need to see it up-close constantly as a reminder. I had heard negative things about Russell Crowe as Javert but felt his singing was good overall and had some really moving moments. All of the singing was good to great in fact. But long before the end I found myself looking at the clock wondering when the revolution was going to be finished already.
B00000K3G8|5.0|I've had the older version of this album for years. This revised version has a bunch of songs on it, that I never heard before. The sound quality is a tad better than the older version too. Definitely recommend this one!
B00DG86ARK|4.0|The concert visuals are truly outstanding. I would rate this 5 stars had they recorded this in DTS HD Master or even Dolby 5.1<br />The caliber of the music here really deserves it. A shame not to use all that available BluRay technology.

B005D4YGRG|5.0|These Newport sandals are my 2nd Keen sandal. I also own a pair of Keen boots which I do not care for ... they are a sandal company and they are the best. These Newports look so nice, especially with a pair of brown socks, that they are my casual footwear, not just a recreational sandal.

1250029465|4.0|Some of you may already by familiar with \\" Bob, the now famous, UK street-cat \\". He's has a YouTube Video, and now even a book about him and his owner James Bowen. Cat lover that I am, I hadn't heard about Bob until I came across this book on Amazon.<br /><br />James Bowen came from a wealthy family, but found himself on a downward spiral. A down and out street musician, he was arrested for petty theft, and addicted to drugs. Trying to turn his life around, he was barely earning enough money to get by. He was living in a run down, supported housing unit in London. He earned money playing his guitar on the streets of London, while tourists and others threw cash into his opened guitar case.<br /><br />One day in 2007, returning to his flat, he noticed a ginger cat inside his building curled on a doormat.  The next day the cat was still there and appeared to be sick and had an injured leg as well. The cat follows James to his flat, and while he tries to nurse the cat back to health, but realizes that the cat needs the expertise of a veterinarian. The local RSPCA  helps to pay for neutering and medical expenses and before long the cat was well and ready to return to the streets where he had come from.<br /><br />The cat, however, wanted no part of the outside cruel world again, and took a liking to James. The cat, named Bob by James, finally had a home, and became like a shadow of James. This cat, honestly, behaved more like a dog than a cat. Extremely loyal, he accompanied his new owner on his daily street gigs, and while James played the guitar, Bob slept in the guitar case in the sun. Other times he posed on his owner's shoulder and entertained tourists on the streets of London. James also saw his daily financial take more than double once Bob was in the picture.<br /><br />Bob and James needed each other and the relationship that developed was truly amazing.  Each gets a second chance at life. This is their story.<br /><br />The book was very enjoyable --- nothing bad happens at the end.  It's a story that will appeal to animal lovers everywhere and not just cat lovers.  At times I felt that certain things about James' life seemed very repetitive, but I was still happy that I got a chance to read their story.  Bob is one unique cat, who has shown his appreciation for his new chance at life in ways that just made me smile.  It's a great story about positive impact an animal can make in our lives - READ IT.ad happens at the end.  It's a story that will appeal to animal lovers everywhere and not just cat lovers.

B001FVV2X2|4.0|Just got started.  Watched first 3 episodes and I'm hooked!  I've five seasons to watch - hope it is this good all the way through!
B005D0TETA|5.0|What can you say? The tracks selected are spot on. The orchestra is a great fit to the performance and the Sound and Visuals are very compelling. If you do ot have this as a Yes fan, you are missing a great performance.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|I felt the price was quite reasonable.  I was amazed at the performances of the lead actors.  Liberace's voice was spot-on.  If I did subscribe to HBO, I probably would not have had access to the extra provided on the DVD and that made the whole experience all the more worthwhile.
B008469DGY|4.0|Found this game fun and challenging. Considering it was free its definitly worth the money! Looking for more like it. Thanks for the freebie!
B00A6L78YE|4.0|Once I got over my initial distrust of a band that could so blatantly rip off what came before (ie: Stones, Stones, Stones) this stuff just got better and better. It's lodged in my head now so I barely even need to refer to the record.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Genius! Dorothy needs her mind, heart, and guts to pursue her quest!  And so do we all. We will find our answers inside ourselves. We don't need a wizard. What a brilliant mythic tale!
B004132HZS|5.0|SHERLOCK is a romp - although I have to say that the first time I saw Benedict Cumberbatch's name on a screen (it was in that lovely film, &#34;Amazing Grace&#34;, also available from Amazon), I told my self, there's an actor who should change his name!  But now I say let him keep it, for he's a fine actor - as is his helpmeet Watson, played admirably by Martin Freeman.  The stories are all there, as Conan Doyle invented them, it's just that Sherlock is using laptops, I-phones, and whizzing (and boy can this man whiz!) about London in taxis and doing his banking in glass palaces as those double decker buses float by.  The film is suspenseful and fun in high degree. due in no small part by some of the most amazing filming these tired old eyes have seen in a month of Sundays.  And, there's a bonus you shouldn't sneeze at - Moriarty as played by Andrew Scott is a tour-de-force.  Amazon usually has a lot of good deals to hand out, so don't let SHERLOCK pass you by - buy it!  P the G
B009RX7IX8|5.0|The 5th season of Castle did a couple things very well.  First, it brought closure to, but did not totally conclude the who killed Beckett's mother storyline.  We finally find out who was behind it all, but the door is left open for more story lines involving that person.  Secondly it finally brought Castle and Beckett together as a couple.<br /><br />Obviously in this kind of show there is always a danger in the series running out of steam when the couple is finally brought together.  That really did not happen this season.  Stana Kanic and Nathan Fillion have very good chemistry, and the writing around the characters did not get stale.  I also liked the fact that they did not go the predictable route and split them up shortly after getting them together.  The writers let the relationship play out over the course of the season.  There was tension in the relationship in the final few episodes, which provided a nice lead up to the cliffhanger ending.<br /><br />The standout episodes of the season to me were the Rear Window spoof, the two-part episode where Alexis is kidnapped, the one where Castle is framed for murder, and the episode where Beckett is caught on a bomb.  That last one shows many of the great moments from the prior seasons through flashbacks.  The show also keeps up the tradition of throwing in references to Firefly, having awesome guest cameos, and overall a great mix of comedy, drama and romance.<br /><br />The show dos not fit into any one specific category.  Like I said above it is a blend.  It is not a comedy but is very funny at times.  It is not a straight up drama, but it does put characters you care about in dramatic situations, and there is romance but it does not dominate the show and is not cheesy.  All in all it is a well written, well acted series and definitely worth checking out. I would advise strongly against just jumping into the show this season if you have not watched the prior seasons.  While there is a story of the week element to the show, there are also multiple arcs that have played out and if you have not seen any of the previous episodes you may be lost at times.<br /><br />For those who do get the DVDs, there are a few bonus features.  There are deleted scenes, commentary on some episodes, a blooper reel and some behind the scenes features.  Not a ton of material, but enough to make those who like to go through that stuff happy.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book is awful.  It is taken me forever to finish because I have no interest.  Would not recommend it to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written. The romance twist was nice. Not a true love story, just love to survive. Clearly different. Excited to read the next book
B001EBYMB2|5.0|This movie captures your attention immediately and never lets you rest. It feels like you are part of the film.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is by far the best traditional country album I have heard in years. Vince Gill and Paul Franklin are phenomenal. The music is all the old traditional music that I grew up on and love. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard songs that you never hear anymore. I love this CD and want to hear more like it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|I did not like the opinions and theories the author expresses under the guise of historical scholarship.<br />I am a follower of the truth.  That truth may be expressed as myth or allegory but the hubris of the author annoys me . He supposedly backs up his opinions with considerable scholarship, but I remain unconvinced.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Works great... very useful, bought one for everyone I know.  Fit the LED flashlight got from Costco.  Got lots of flashlight and each of them is holster with this...
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|Don't find out anything about the plot before you watch.<br />And don't worry about catching every detail the first time through.<br />Just let the thrilling story and superb acting and powerful images carry you away.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Great, Great, Great Music!!!!!!<br /><br />I love One republic they are a very talented band, I am loving every track on this album.  I can't get enough and can't stop dancing everytime I hear Counting Stars.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|Pretty much like angry birds but u can also kill birds with pigs.it's really addicting and I like the star wars concept so I rate it a 3. U may think otherwise but it's a fun game so get it
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Action packed and not at all slow for such a long movie. Highly recommended! Makes me want to watch the others.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I bought this because I like to read the book before I see the movie. Of course, I liked the book better. The series has a lot of potential, and is off to a great start with this one.
B00EVU3S4U|2.0|Brian De Palma took some flack in the 1970's for ripping off Alfred Hitchcock so obviously, but at least he used to be good at it.  After 1984's Body Double he decided to branch out into more serious films with generally disastrous results and he never got his groove back when he attempted to return to the thriller genre that had been his bread and butter for the early part of his career.  Passion is easily his worst thriller since the embarrassing Raising Cain.  This is a remake of the excellent but very cold French thriller Love Crimes about the relationship between a cold as ice business executive who steals her assistant's idea for an ad campaign then humiliates her brutally when higher ups in the company find out and she loses a coveted promotion.  I would simply say save your time, skip this garbage and watch the original but some people have an aversion to movies with English subtitles and would rather watch a terrible English remake than a foreign language film--but this thing is about as terrible as terrible English language remakes get.  Both of the film's stars are horribly miscast--Rachel McAdams is too young and likable to be playing the ice-queen boss who everyone is afraid of and Noomi Rapace is not young or fragile enough to pull off the naive, worshipful assistant.  Brian De Palma throws in some elements from his Hitchcock bag of tricks to try and make the material his own but, like Raising Cain, his stylistic touches descend into silly self-parody pretty quickly.  There's a reason this movie is going straight to video in spite of the name cast and director--it's god-awful.  Brian De Palma has made some really terrible movies since his early winning streak (Raising Cain; Bonfire of the Vanities; The Black Dahlia; Mission to Mars; Snake Eyes) and Passion fits squarely in that camp.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Love this game and as others have said it is so addictive and can be enjoyed without having to spend money as you can wait for an hour or so and the energy builds back up. My only bug bear was as I was so far into the game and was then throw out and it started from the beginning again lost all my coins etc.Frustrating! Still love it though.
B006PIXKVW|4.0|I like this movie - it is nice to watch something that doesn't have a lot of foul language in it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG OMG OMG OMG infighting best game in history of world. Please get so much fun u will never live without it
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|I didnt like it. Its just Imagination movie, and bored one to watch . Other than that nothing to say
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I already own the \\"on the ear\\" Grado SR60 and the wireless Sennheiser RS170.  Both are excellent.  These were my points of reference for comparing my new purchase.<br /><br />I was looking for an \\"over the ear\\" set to listen to short wave AS WELL AS portable MP3's and Pandora without disturbing those around me.<br /><br />Initially thinking that extremely faithful reproduction was not that important for my primary use, I looked at the less than $50 cans.  I learned this was a mistake.  Among the best rated among the less expensive units was the Monoprice, which is what I ordered.  After testing and comparing it with my other phones, I determined they were unacceptable.  They lacked \\"air\\" and sounded like there was excessive harmonic distortion, possibly from reverberation inside the fairly large cans.  Choral lyrics were distorted, not from cone breakup, but from internal resonance, I suspect.  Those were returned and I upped the ante and ordered this Sony.<br /><br />The Sony sound is dryer, not as much low-mid, but cleaner mids and highs.  These phones will rival the two really nice ones I already own, but with a different purpose.<br /><br />The form factor is also better:  lighter, less bulky, and more comfortable than the Monoprice, feeling very much like my Senns but with a wire.

B00EYN3HTA|5.0|While studying English literature, one of our teachers told the class that poetry has the uncanny ability to unveil the truth, even if only as a small mirage. Generally speaking, the reader senses the presence of something else, something that was not said, that was only implied, or perhaps only desired by the reader. Take these two lines from the poem The Cashquar from this book, \\"Peter, Enchantment and Stardust:\\" \\"Wilderness is where I roam / A place where free is my home.\\" When I read things like this, I feel that something has touched my inner self. Well, this `touching of one's soul' is much more difficult with prose; although it can be done by the great masters. This collection is divided into four sections of diverse and intriguing poems. For those of you who have read Mr. O'Brien's \\"Peter: A Darkened Fairytale\\" and are familiar with his incredible metaphors, the reading will be familiar. For those who haven't, well, prepare yourselves for a series of enchanting twists and turns. In The Vaandorg Dragon, the creature, apparently referring to humans, says the following line: \\"Lovely soft flesh makes good soup.\\" Oh, yes, remember that Mr. O'Brien enjoys certain degree of darkness. In his poem Bisquenta, you can read \\"If you're a merman better hide / I need some food and you'll do fine.\\"<br />There are, of course, many other types of poems to be enjoyed, for example in Kipple, you can read: \\"How nice to see you again / To feel your voice / And have a chat / I can't believe you are back.\\" If you have ever longed for someone, you'll know what I mean. This is nice, intriguing poetry, five stars. Jake Taylor
B004LPLU4K|4.0|I believe I may have read the story somewhere else but the move was good and the children played their parts wonderfully.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I am a voracious reader. I love to read books regardless of their genre; if its a good story with unforgettable characters true bliss (at least for me) is achieved. That being said I hate when fans of a series give a book a 5 star rating solely based on their love of the preceding book(s). I pride myself on being a bipartisan and judging everything on its own merit. I liked the first novel and found many elements of the story new and exciting, but honestly thought this book would flop trying to achieve the same appeal of the first book. One word to sum up this book . . . STUNNING! Sanderson's ability to weave a story is boarding on Orson Scott Card and George R.R. Martin level. (trust me I would never say this lightly). The characters feel real and complex. The plot thanks to the psychological and physical conflicts is gripping and the ending while very surprising is realistic and exciting. There are some lose ends with the sub and main plot lines but those are cleared in the the third novel. Overall this novel great and a welcome addition to my collection.

B00D3V85FA|5.0|Excellent Excellent Excellent.  Saw them perform in '78 and just saw them in Irvine, CA.  They are one of the best bands in rock.  See them if you can.  The sound, the set list, and the background video show was A+. Quite a memorable show.
B009HCBCUE|4.0|These recordings are now in the public domain in the European Union which makes it easy for upstart labels like this one to assemble these kinds of compilations and sell them for low prices (no royalties to pay). This also allows the inclusion of the Paul Anka recordings which in the United States would have to be licensed through Paul himself. Quality is pretty good, sources are probably from previously released CDs (but good ones), a couple of tracks may have come from vinyl but were cleaned up nicely. A lot of great music at a low price.
B005544TRQ|5.0|good banter and interesting character development - when I thought it was going to get stale or repetitive, they changed it up. I thought.  I know nothing of legal jargon so I enjoy that aspect too.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a women about to enter the workforce soon, with a vision of management in my future career, Lean In really inspired me! Her stories about the way we, as women, think about ourselves and our accomplishments are right on point. I found myself nodding my head and agreeing to her insights. But her advice on how to break ourselves from these &#34;societal rules&#34; are great! Very eye-opening and leaves me feeling stronger and more passionate about wanting to increase the amount of women in management positions in the US.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I was convinced by a critic's review to acquire this book, yet I don't recall when or where (sorry!), or even what it was that convinced me!  Once I had it on my iPad, it took me awhile to get started...<br /><br />I enjoyed this story; Neil Gaiman has quite a talent for story-telling and possesses a solid ability to write well.<br />His story could get a bit twisted, and even confusing, but I decided to just &#34;go with the flow,&#34; and managed to find a safe way through to the end (I felt inclined to psychoanalyze the story and the writer on several occasions, but chose not to).  Gradually, I came to believe that the twists and confusion were intentional, since Gaiman was mostly narrating with the voice of a young boy and never broke character, so knowing children of that age, it made sense to me  I was able to hear the child's voice and I could hear the grown man's voice. His subtle transition between the adult and the child were impressive and filled with innocence and honesty.<br /><br />Gaiman surprised me with this unique story (and it has been awhile since the last time I felt inclined to say that about a writer); he manages to pull the reader into the story, as though you are sitting across from the boy/man listening as he shares his tale.  But the uniqueness of Gaiman's writing could simply strike you as annoying.<br /><br />I can picture recommending this to about half my friends.<br />Hope this is helpful.

B002U3CCKQ|5.0|There is nothing more to add to the favourable reviews. Dark places is a book that will stay with you for a long time.
B00000JMOF|5.0|FRANKENSTEIN HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE MONSTERS OF ALL TIME. AND BORIS KARLOFF IS DEFINITELY THE BEST ACTOR TO PLAY THIS CHARACTER. IT IS JUST ONE OF THE CLASSICS OF ALL TIME AND IT IS A MUST FOR ALL HORROR FANS TO HAVE IN THEIR COLLECTION.
B00BV5FVR0|4.0|It's wierd, but I liked it . A good read if you've also read the previous books in the series. Scary look at what could be our future .
B0064MPXFA|3.0|Its a bit slow in the beginning, but it did pick up on the last episode. Not sure if I will waste my time to watch Season 2.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|This is not so easy to go through. I don't like the idea of having to go on facebook to see what this wants to show you.
B0063M22QO|4.0|It's a nice presentation and the tiles are attractive. It's been years since I played and this version is a keeper
B0060AY6FO|1.0|This was my first attempt at a PD James novel -- and my last.  I literally gave up after getting 20% of the way through.  It starts with at least 100 pages of dense background story, and none of it was particularly interesting.  In fact there may have been more than 100 pages of background.  I don't know because I just didn't care enough to invest more of my time to absorb all these intricate and uninteresting details of these families' lives and marriages.<br /><br />PD James?  I just don't know what all the fuss is about.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is really improving her style with each new Cd.  Looking forward to the next one.  The CD was in very good condition.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Was very skeptical when I downloaded the game. Free games are usually hit or miss. Love the graphics and its fun and challenging at the same time :) great download!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Very easy installation, up and running in 5 minutes. Not much content, Netflix's and you tube. Maybe Apple TV on the cheap. Waited a looooong time for product.
B00C2C637I|4.0|If you like Ray Bradbury this is one of his best. There's always something supernatural about carnies. Stephen King likes this one too.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|Incredible book. Must read. I stumbled upon it by happenstance and very happy I did. Topics that I've heard over and over are much clearer.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|The complete package and all for free! A great app that not only helps with speaking (normal pronunciation and slow pronunciation for those of us who need it) and reading, it also gets you writing in the language right away. It's both fun and work.
B0018QOIXU|2.0|I did not care for the early recordings by Adele(19).  I feel she got much better as she refined her style.  The CD is in excellent condition.  Did not have any problems with the shipper.
B00640UICA|1.0|I like the game a lot, but it's the second time it wipes my progress and I have to start from the begining. I won't do it for a third time, I'm glad I got it as free app of the day and didn't pay for it. I think it would be worth the price if it wasn't for that glitch.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I'm a fan of both of the stars of this movie and loved the idea of a difference in the times and expectations.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|Highly recommended and fun to read.  This is book one in a series of four and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|great series, love having it on my tablet. So easy just to catch up anywhere and looks great to @
B0026IQYEA|5.0|This version of the reign of Queen Elizabeth is Hollywood at its best.  The story is presented with historical integrity, the political conflicts are brutal without being gratuitous and the struggle she went through to survive in a man's world is very evident. The camera and design work absolutely beautiful.  I also use most of this movie in a couple of my high school history classes to reflect the time period and the students always like it though it takes some explaining.  Watch it first for appropriate scenes.<br /><br />If you need Closed Captions buy the DVD.  Amazon's online version does not have them.  A shortcoming since the DVD version does.<br /><br />This movie can be watched many, many times!
B0093BUVPG|5.0|Jose James is an artist; he's exploring melody, rhythm, collaboration, life, the history of black music, and his own vocal instrument.  Like Erykah Badu, he's a soul artist with a jazz vibe. Like Bill Withers he's an R&B man with a heavy singer/songwriter accent. Like Rene Marie or Bobby McFerrin, he's a jazz artist who's not going to let anyone's definition of jazz limit him.<br /><br />Whatever he is, he's a hell of a compelling singer with a great record.  Socially conscious and sexy.  He's great live, too.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001NU0K3S Mama's Gun]]<br />[[ASIN:B0044JZ93Q Greatest Hits: Lean On Me]]<br />[[ASIN:B004INNRGE Voice of My Beautiful Country]]<br />[[ASIN:B000005H4A Spontaneous Inventions]]
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Excellent! Very good book i like this author alot...cannot waiy to read her other books soon! Thank you much :)
B001FLYYIM|5.0|I was curious about this game for a while and decided to finally pick up the cards after learning some of the rules and have never been happier, cards are made with a hard plastic similar to a thick playing card which is sleeved a few times. So shuffling them is a little tricky but this is a great game to pick up.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|classic film, gotta love fight club man. we are the same decaying organic matter as everything else. the things you own end up owning you.
B004XISI4A|4.0|Good, better than A feast of Crows, but weaker than a Storm of Swords. Lots of new characters and plots slowing the pacing of the original plot strands. Stick with it and you find great moments and surprises.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I absolutely love this series! It shows the ups and downs of a young woman growing up in poverty and landing a job at her cousins post office.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This show is all you would  want in a television show to be! It has a plot, it is entertaining, sex, exciting from begining to end. I wold recommend this show to all who want an adventure right in your living room. You have to get this one in your collection!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun game. Challenging and quite fun. Good graphics and can truly be played for free. I highly recommend this game.<br /><br />Derzwerg73
B0000266T2|5.0|I have looked for this item for a long time and I am thrilled to have found it here, ordered and received on time in perfect, brand new condition! Thank you!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play free mode and, while some are quite simple to solve, I find I've played it for 15-20 minutes without realizing it. Great brain activity!
B001EBV0OY|4.0|Good cast, good story. The story is interesting because it give one a view of what it might be like in a maximum security prison.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This thing has good reviews it looks fun I saw the pictures and it looks cool common I'll try it now!!!
B001AITH50|4.0|From the vampire saga of author Anne Rice, about7 books in total, this on is the first or second book.
B00BZB1ME6|5.0|My whole family loves it!! You can't beat Mr. Miyagi and Daniel Larusso!! My kids range from a four year old boy t a nine and fifteen year old girls. They all love it and we watch it constantly!! BONZAI!!
B000KITQK2|5.0|Worked very well for getting a louder level to my dean markley passive pro mag.  Would recommend for someone in the same situation -- needing a little boost on their sound hole pick-up.
055358202X|1.0|For fans of the series, don't feel bad about skipping this one. It is a mistake to be quietly ignored; by far the weakest entry. It takes a long boring time to read, it involves the least interesting characters and nothing really happens. No, seriously, almost nothing happens. Unbelievable but true. You won't miss any important events necessary for continuity, since it takes place at the same time as A Dance with Dragons. The only interesting part is what happens to Arya, but save yourself some trouble and read about that on Wikipedia.<br /><br />Now, a Dance with Dragons is worth reading. GRR Martin re-found his mojo with that book. It continues where A Storm of Swords left off. It involves all the characters we love and the plotlines we're dying to hear the rest of.<br /><br />Just ignore this book. You'll not miss anything.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Cath is every fangirl! Her college experience felt very real and familiar! I couldn't put this book down! If you ever fell in love with a series or write fanfiction then you really should read this!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for horse owners and lovers as well.  Nice natural motions and movement. Grqceful depiction of eqine love. Never in a million years would i have thought someone woul capture horse love for care giver in an app.  We heart it. Amazing little app.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The author makes this thought provoking subject fun and even laughable.  It will make you think twice about what you think about! I would even go as far as life changing.<br /><br />I have purchased a copy for a friend and have shared some experiments with friends.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Great movie. Action packed. The threat of alien life to destroy the earth. Where would we go and what would we do?
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is amazing. I love it. It makes me want to read all of his Percy Jackson books immediately.
B000Q9IR0A|5.0|Enjoyed very much! Very helpful and beautifully recorded.<br />It has shifted my paradigm on strategy and execution. I wish I'd read it earlier.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The awesomest game ever! There is a lot of things to unlock and it gets faster later on. Its sot of like temple run.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|It seems to me, as is often the case with fiction writing, that the author just had to wrap the book up and that not as much consideration was given to the ending as to the main substance or body of the novel. Thoroughly enjoyable read overall though, and this from someone who generally has an aversion to time travel and time shift. King's attention to detail in the 50s and 60s is remarkable and the whole Kennedy saga never ceases to fascinate.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Takes the new twist and the original shows and first series of movies and ties them together. Wonderful new ideas, nods to the original series and first movies. Action, excitement and some of the old humor and banter. A neat experience
B00008EO0F|5.0|Being in high school when this album was released, I was happy to find a brand-new, unopened pristine jacket cover to display in my music room. Looks like it could've come right out of Sam Goody's Record Store in Crabtree Valley Mall :) (Which is where I got my first Custom Black Gibson Les Paul in 1976).<br /><br />No disappointments here. Shipper delivered as promised - bravo, bravo.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|If you can break this knife, you are doing something very wrong with it. This is a very stout blade. It is a bit heavy, but for general woods use this is a fantastic buy for the money. Mr. Becker likes his knives to be customized and I am still not sure what exactly I am going to do to it yet.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great read moves quickly and is very captivating.  A must read for anyone who enjoys historical fiction.  Many hours of research was put into creating this work and the end result is masterful.
B0041PIJOE|5.0|the 60s were a big time for the king between making his movies and cutting records . all Elvis fans need to have all three boxes sets for their collection
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am torn having read through this book now.  I know so many things and cannot share them.  I have greatly enjoyed the books and am a huge fan of the TV series.  Cannot wait for season 4.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative book. I have struggled for years with stomach and digestive pain. Doctors I saw never gave me any direction including my gastroenterologist. Finally went gluten free on my own...helped a little...still had pain. Then went completely grain free. Finally better!!! Found this book a couple of weeks after going grain free. I wish I had been able to read it years ago. I probably would have branched out on my own long before I did. Thank you for writing this book, Dr. Davis!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I had to reinstall this because it crashed after two months of progress, and I got no support from online help except for stock answer that the tech team was aware of problem and supposedly working on it. Gave up and reinstalled.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game<br /> Beacuse you can clean your horse and buy unicorns and buy a zebra it looks like the real one from africa
B008XBHBX2|5.0|Good performances by the cast.  A good mix of humor and fright.  Local characters seem just a little bigger than life.
B004LR5K0I|5.0|The King back on stage where he belongs , the last box set to close out the music that made him the greatest entertainer of all time . A must for all Elvis fans !!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Has given me the opportunity to have fun with a child that has grown up and moved out.  Quick little words throughout the day keeps us connected :)
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Interesting and easy read about the history of the early church, and one interpretation of how Christian theology evolved and coalesced around a particular set of beliefs versus the alternatives.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is almost like having Sirrus. I have a Bluetooth speaker and the music sounds good. You have lots of choices. It is very easy to navigate to what you wish to hear.

B001W63DXC|5.0|Great band, great cd, and great concert. This was an amazing show. So glad I saw it and they recorded it!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's addicting. Once you start you have to keep playing daily. I love it and so do my kids! A game for people of all ages, boys and girls!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Excellent show from the writing to the acting.  There is not much bad you can say about Game of Thrones.  It's one of those shows you can't stop watching until you run out of episodes to watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Coming from a family  of thinkers this game was highly entertaining. My 4 yr old helped me find clues. Can't wait for more levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super addictive and so entertaining not only for me but for my kids as well! I couldn't have asked for more in a free app!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Although it became more than a bit predictable at times, I still found the character development engaging.  Looking forward to the next installment!
B0006B29Z2|5.0|If you are a Maiden fan, this is a must have! Great dvd with lots of background and good stories and old footage.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|I  really liked this movie, it was entertaining, and that's what I want from a movie. I didn't read the book, so I suspect that if someone is let down by this film it is because they have read the book and it didn't live up to those expectations, as is usually the case when a book is made into a movie. I thought that it was fast paced film, kept me watching from the opening to the end. I recommend it.
B003K1EYM6|2.0|THOUGH IT WAS ALSO FOR COMPAC FLASH CARD ! RETURNED IT FOR REFUND. I DID NOT REALIZED THE THIS PARTICULAR CARD WAS OUT DATED.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Several new twists to the original; mirror bubbles, shining bubbles that must be aligned with gems, and deadly bubbles are just a few of the new challenges in this update.  Definitely worth a look!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|This was a quick and easy read, and I liked the main characters -- Mr Penumbra is delightful, if not entirely believable -- and the way Sloan built up of suspense about the mysterious sect Penumbra belonged to, but I finally found the book silly and overly message-driven.  It is something of a parable about the clash and reconciliation of traditional bibliophilia and the digital age (not to mention a paean to fanboy-dom): not to worry, it all turns out happily ever after -- we CAN all get along!  I think I maybe missed something, or perhaps I'm too old to get it.  The experience of reading it was pleasant enough, but it was not a meaty morsel -- more like Pringles, or cotton candy.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|this is twisted history at best. the anit-american slant is not as good but understandable. still recommend themovie to people
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun. Although I'm a little irritated that it seems to only have 10 levels and makes you rate them to continue.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Sweet but predictable.  When you are in the need for that kind of movie with no big surprises, it is perfect.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Really like it. No setting from state to state, all automatically generated.<br />Would recommend just for the daily forecast, works beautifully.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|This Iron Man was just as good as the first. Some people don't like Iron Man 2, I do. I would rank this as 2nd best in the franchise with Iron Man 1 being the best. The whole Manderin twist was brilliant! Tony without the suit was a good! Buy it Rent it Watch it when comes on regular T.V.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|I can't believe I read the whole thing! I guess one wants to know if the guy is going to go through with the euthanasia, but what a pile of pablum!  The story is sooo  predictable, and the characters are straight out of central casting:  Quick!  Bring me a severely injured young lord-of-the-universe type, a quirky young woman, an uptight wealthy mother, a philandering father and that tea lady's family from Love Actually! I was really surprised it is such a big seller.
1616550414|5.0|Its a little unstructured, just pictures with little explanation. But I loved the content anyway, I'm very happy with it!
B00CWVFPGO|1.0|download this movie twice, once in living room tivo and then bedroom tivo still no luck and payed twice, how do i get refund
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This should be required reading for teens. I will never understand feeling so lost that you think suicide is the only answer.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Great movie for Zombie lovers, and a great movie for those who drool over Brad Pitt. It's a real nail-biter from 2-3 minutes into the show.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Excellent, fantasy story! I started with City of Bones and couldn't wait to read the others in the series. A worthwhile read!
B0009MAO46|3.0|We purchased this item for our son. However, we could not play disc 1 which has the story. The disc 2 is fine, but it only contains bonus tracks. Our DVD player has the right region code, and is not broken as it can play the disc 2 and all other DVDs we have.<br /><br />The seller kindly provided us with a replacement disk later.
0307949508|5.0|This book is No. 2 in the Millennium Trilogy and I haven't read No. 1 yet. I don't usually read this sort of book, but I happened to see the TV-series which inspired me to get hold of the books.<br /><br />The best feature in this book is the character of the protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, who is an original, captivating person. She is highly intelligent, has a photographic memory and reads books on advanced mathematics for pleasure. She is especially gifted as regards computers, having particular skills in hacking, which means she can gain access to whatever information she requires. She is highly moralistic in her own way, but if provoked by evil characters can revert to extreme violence. Abused as a child, she is eccentric and lacking in social skills, but those who get to know her properly grow fond of, and respect, her.<br /><br />In this volume Lisbeth is falsely accused of a triple murder, of two journalists working on exposing guilty parties in the sex-trafficking industry and also her corrupt guardian who has sexually abused her. The press makes her out to be a psychotic, retarded cold-blooded murderer, but her few friends know that this is not true. Her face is on the front page of every newspaper in the country, and everyone is after her. Her old friend Blomkvist, with whom she no longer wishes contact, is nevertheless still a staunch friend to her and works to support her and find out who the real murderers are.<br /><br />This is an exceedingly suspenseful, unputdownable book. The late author, Stieg Larsson, writes well (or at least his English translator does - except for a few anomalies). The book provides us with satisfying detail about Salander's character and doings, and explains the whole business of how and why she has been set up.<br /><br />This is an unusual and engrossing thriller which I strongly advise you to read together with the two other parts of the trilogy.<br /><br />P.S. Like another reviewer, I too noticed the author's mistake regarding the Sicilian Defence, which is a defence for Black and not something decided by the player playing White. But this is a minor detail.rding the Sicilian Defence, which is a defence for Black and not something decided by the player playing White. But this is a minor detail.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|All the kids are addicted to this one. Bonus because I think it really helps build mental agility. Great game.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is a really good book series, I think for those who haven't read it they should they will love it.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Been listening to this since. April and I still include much of it in my playlists. Great upbeat sound, great production values, great all around album
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|Not really a Selleck fan, until now.  And I had no idea what to expect, other than being slightly encouraged by the others' reviews.<br /><br />The acting, direction, music, casting, all sort of weave together to create a story that pulled me in.  There were a couple of predictable elements in the plot and yet they fit. But even there, it was rewarding to watch these very sympathetic characters live out their destinies.  The bad guys were \\"stone cold,\\" but not overdone or over-acted.<br /><br />It's all against a fairly somber world view, and the music seems to mourn with us for the killers' innocent victims, but then hope seems to fight the shadows back.<br /><br />I realize this is poorly composed, but not really trying too hard.  It's late, I'm tired, and I didn't want the lights to go out before I gave this movie - and the series - five stars.  I've only seen two of them, full disclosure, but expecting more fine story telling.<br /><br />Tom Selleck - haven't seen you around for so long.  You were reminding me of Eastwood somehow - not as a type or a caricature, but with your own strength and depth.  So glad you're doing this great work!  Please continue!
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|Having watched twin peaks on tv 23 years ago, my memory of it was that it was quirky and funny and different and memorable! How fun to watch it again! I loved it then, I love it now. The characters are standout. The FBI agent is straight on, played by a younger Kyle McLaughlin of desperate housewives fame. It all centers around the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer. There is innocent goofiness. (Lucy, Andy, Nadine )  There is silliness. (bobby and Shelley taking care of Leo for the insurance money)  There is intrigue. (Josie, Ben and his brother.) There is craziness.(Leland)<br />What a blast from the past!
0399213015|4.0|This mini book was a lot smaller than I expected, but good quality. The size is such that I can slip it into my handbag and have a book for the grand kids when we are out and they need something to keep them occupied.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Like temple run but I thought younger kid friendly. Seems to not be as responsive as temple run so kids got frustrated easily. Think the older kids like it though.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Loved the script!  Problem solving throughout, real possibility with the incurable diseases we face now.  Reality of non-essential personnel when in a crisis.
B00DC8O6T8|4.0|These guys deserve your attention. They are a fun, lighthearted pop band with catchy riffs. If you like bouncy, fun pop songs, this is the band for you.  I'm sure we will be hearing more from them other than their one hit  - Safe and Sound on the radio.
1607963027|5.0|To me, one of the most amazing books that has ever been written.  This tiny book is dense with symbolism and truth.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Works great, I am loving my Samsung more than ever it is so easy to download music thanks I highly recommend.
B008469DGY|4.0|Really fun game, very addicting. One problem is on the world tour mode it some times gives you a silver trophy if you score too many points... And then it stops showing you the points goals and there is no way to get the gold. I  reset the game a couple of times and got the same result. 21284 points on pinewood. Guess I'm too good :-) fix this for 5 starts
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This part of the drama drew us into the series  more deeply and emotionilally. Maked us so anxious for season 4.  the costumes and setting are intreeging and lovely. Actors are  very well cast.  WE enjoyed the series.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|Great little game, I started with the F-18 landings game, this is a nice addition with the historic warbirds. Very nice graphics
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My tablet is a Proscan model. I wanted to try a game on my tablet and this was it. I was amaze that this ran on it but, like with most of this apps are for newer models with the fastest cpu.  Was fun the few times I ran the app but it freezes, skip and other. For games I stick to my 3DS.
B002RKRUEA|3.0|I know this is considered classic literature (which I like as I am older) but I just couldn't make it all the way through.  Fortunately, as this is a book of musings much like a journal, you don't have to make it all the way through all at once.  Though I haven't finished, I did enjoy it enough that I am fairly sure I will return to it one day to finish it.
B0038NN3B4|2.0|Good book, very helpful.  However, for the Kindle version, no pages are listed.  According to Kindle it is up to the publisher to embed page numbers.  I sort of expected more from Adkins.  But, then again, from the all the reviews saying how broke the iPad app is, perhaps profit margin, vs completeness, is the objective here.  Sorta sad.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Really fun game but too short....  thought there would be many more levels... hopefully the creators will be adding levels soon!
B00F91H15W|4.0|A quick scan of rotten tomatoes before this rental showed many criticisms hinged on a lack of character development and unclear meaning.  This is why the film is good.  Among all characters there were no facile attempts to create a plot or dialogue that goes beyond theft and the desire for fashion.  No dumb love story.  No developed background into the families that these kids are brought up in (aside from the mutual detachment of the kids and parents).  This lack of development and depth seems to be an appropriate commentary on the thought processes that accompany this crime, there isn't much regard for forethought or consequence.  Perhaps this is what I liked the most, is as a viewer, we are asked to simply watch and see what happens, which isn't a long shot from what the characters are doing themselves.  It's mindless, but it's fun (and it looks good in the process).  Aren't films allowed to be just that?  If one wishes, there is plenty of substrate here for a commentary on the thinking that modern culture (I'm thinking mostly of social media) produces.<br /><br />As a reference, the last movie I enjoyed watching was amour.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it works well and is free!<br />it has a nice alarm sound to wake up to and is easy to reset.

B000SEGMAU|5.0|I'm a collector of books, and since I got my Kindle, I collect them almost without thought. So when my parents told me about this book they'd read, Tuesdays with Morrie, I pulled out the Kindle and bought it as we talked. Then I promptly forgot about it.<br /><br />Fast forward a couple of months. I was looking for something to read. My eyes fell on that book I'd ordered (one of many, I might add) and I opened it up. A few hours later, I'm done, but I don't think I'll ever be finished with this book. I'll be reading it and reading it for quite awhile.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? Yes, with reservations. I would recommend it only if you want to really take a look at your life, and are willing to face up to some uncomfortable truths.
B004R0WKNE|5.0|This was a cute cute movie!  It was funny and romantic. I could watch it again and again. Certainly worth renting or buying the DVD.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging. A great game for hours of fun. Some of the puzzles are really hard. I have really enjoyed it so far.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|FAOTD Finished the game in 2 days, lots of fun, got perfect scores in every level and got all the upgrades. Didn't see any in game purchases or ads. Not that hard, just takes some patience.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great story about 2 people both facing challenges and how they see each other.  Will make me more aware of how I treat people.
159420411X|3.0|Would like to sell at the end of semester - Only used one chapter, I do not think I need to keep it.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|The reason its awsome the levels are challenging the reason its ok it has bad it makes me do over the levels all the time
1616202416|5.0|One of my favorite books that I've ever read. It is so.... relevant. I love how Adichie gives us an innocent portrayal of such strong themes. Let's just say this book made me cry.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|You will really enjoy this game.  It keeps your mind and eyes active.  You will find it hard to put down.  Enjoy.
B008MVPHNE|5.0|I have several pairs of the old crocs.  Green, yellow, black, blue and brown.  I was able to buy these at an outlet store so they were super cheap.  I noticed the older models were super soft and cushy.  The newer models are harder and not as comfortable.  These duet models are like my originals.  Soft and cushy.  I love them.  I bought my size.  But I like that they fit loose and roomy.  I bought 3 of the duets.  Black, navy blue and now the \\"sea blue\\".  Very cool.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Fascinating, intriguing, creates the desire for the reader to move on to the next page to find answers to childhood trauma!
1118109791|3.0|The cover looks like a new book, but 3 sides of the book tells another story... It's ok in all.
B005DJREJS|4.0|This show is MTV revisiting the success of My So Called Life, but with a new generation. Don't remember that show? Then Awkward is perfect for you. The characters are well rounded and the dialog is great, it really made me remember how wonderful and horrible high school was. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is a bunch of stuff that all together is unrealistic and I have difficulty suspending my disbelief that much.
0140135154|5.0|The product came in a quick and orderly manner. The book itself is one that I used for class and is so good that I bought a second one for my psyc. class.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed solving the many intricate puzzles you are challenged with as you progress through the game and was really disappointed when I reached the end.  The recently released &#34;epilog&#34; chapter was great fun and a teaser of additional chapters to be released soon.  This game features real 3D graphics that allow you to rotate,  elevate and zoom into virtually any area of the cabinets you are trying to gain access to.  If you enjoy solving puzzles, this is a must play game.
B007REAIUE|5.0|best thing to come out of Tulsa in years!  Very catchy and different than alot of music coming out today
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The game is very well detailed an  the animals are amazing, but two things that I think should be taken into account<br /><br />1. You should be able to sell items you don't need or accidentally bought too many of<br />2. When you edit your park, whatever is close to that blue arrow ( to close the edit option) you can't place because it thinks you are trying to close the option, and its quite annoying
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is slick, plug and play, smooth operation and easy to connect devices. Software and flexibility of use is a bit limited at the moment but I am sure the apps will be flowing before to long.
B004X80QNG|3.0|I used this program when I had an IPAD and loved it. So I was happy to see it available on Android. The problem is you now have to have an internet connection to use it. So if I am not at home it is useless.<br /><br />Too many Android programs require connection to the Android store to use. This problem needs to be fixed. Since changing to Android I love many things about it but this could be a deal breaker.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I love this app it's really interesting I just wish you could<br />Get come to the pork side besides that I think it's a great app for kids and<br />Adults
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It works like it does on my PC and I like that. Thank you for another great program for my tablet
0380713802|4.0|Around 1990, Bill Bryson felt a yen to wander lonely as a cloud in Europe. A middle-aged, generally uxurious fella, it irked him that in 17 years of living in Great Britain, he'd only been across the Channel for three brief visits.<br /><br />So off he went, pack on his back, but not alone.  With him were some understandably indelible memories of 20 years earlier when he and his friend, Katz, lit out for the old country. Bryson, 1990, follows mostly in the footsteps of Bryson & Katz, 1970.<br /><br />Readers may recall Katz as his companion on the Appalachian Trail in \\"A Walk Through the Woods.\\"  There, Katz's direct action against whatever ailed him (like lightening his pack by throwing most of their food over cliff) and briskly-to-the-sharp-point complaints played well with Bryson's more positive (or at least determined) spin for really funny, now iconic book.<br /><br />This time, Bryson goes it alone as traveller & writer.  He has to be both Katz & Bryson for the re-run. Now & again, Bryson not only recalls Katz but seems to be channeling Katz's kvetches. However, kvetch or not, much is really, really funny and rarely, rarely dull. This 1990-2 trip seems both the best of times and the worst of times.<br /><br />There were plenty of the best of times and few write as deftly as Bryson.<br /><br />--After 16 days in Hammerfest, selected solely to see the Northern Lights, his magnificent reward for bitter cold & not much to do:  \\"...a display of lights that went on for hours.  There was only one color, that eerie luminous green you see on radar screens, but the activity was frantic. Narrow swirls of light would sweep across the great dome of the sky, then hang there like vapor trails...\\"<br /><br />--In Copenhagen, \\"Is there anything..to beat finding yourself at large in a foreign city on a fair spring evening, loafing along unfamiliar streets in the long shadows of a lazy sunset, pausing to gaze in shop windows or at some church or lovely square...deciding whetherthat cheerful & homey restaurant you will remember fondly for years is likely to lie down this street or that one...?\\"<br /><br />--And in the Netherlands, an exchange between a kind-faced hotel-keeper & his wife, Marta, (in Dutch) about the availability of a room for Bryson, as Bryson heard it.  Many readers may find this episode really, really, REALLY funny. Its' punch line is, \\"Most heartily\\" and the dialog which can not be reproduced in this review may leave susceptible readers, like Marta, most m**st.<br /><br />The worst of times are frequent.<br /><br />\\"I took a place in one of the lines.  Progress was glacial. It was hot.  I was tired, I was sweaty, I was hungry,  My feet hurt.  I wanted a bath.  I wanted a large dinner & several beers.  There wasn't a single part of me that was happy.\\"<br /><br />Bryson calls them as he sees them, with an acerbic comment (or many) a la Katz. Occasionally, the innocents get caught in a blast intended for the guilty.<br />Readers can think of \\"Neither Here Nor There\\" as a sometimes fretful guide to Europe.  Most travellers have had times like that & may admire Bryson's way with words in expressing their own eerie flashes of occasional fury.<br /><br />A lot of skies get changed in this 30 chapter, 240 page book including those over Oslo, Paris, Brussels, Belgium, Aachen & Cologne, Hamburg, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Rome (which delighted our traveller), Naples, Florence, Milan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Bulgaria (which did not delight).<br /><br />Readers approaching these pages knowing what to expect will enjoy \\"Neither Here Nor There\\" most heartily and most m**stly. At the low used book prices, a fine value!
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Great movie for X-Men fans if you're a lover of high-class Si-FY adventures.  A must for any real fan of X-Men
0062124293|5.0|Caitlin Moran is my new hero- she's funny and smart, and not afraid to tell her truth. Highly enjoyable read.
1250006341|4.0|This book is wonderful if you love Downton Abbey the TV program.  It makes the program even more interesting. Have given it as a gift and she was thrilled.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|I played  few maps, it's okay for a while, then it gets kind of boring uncles  you would get into it or buy new maps, but I would try it for sure, off you like it, buy new maps and such to play it more!
0880796863|2.0|On the first shuffle the corner of one of the cards separated from its backing. The design on the outside packaging is the same pattern as the back of the cards but not as nice. The packaging has a metallic gold on violet and the back of the cards has a light blue and white. Looks good in package as a coffee table book but because of the card separating from its backing ON THE FIRST SHUFFLE its not going to last long for multiple tarot spreads... :(
B002PE0HCU|3.0|We watched this movie after seeing \\"The Girl\\". From that historical perspective it was interesting despite the 1960's limited production values,the archaic Hollywood dialogue and the pseudo, stagy British drawl pronunciation of the some of the cast.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|not much action,  lots of people and places I never heard of and cant pronounce glad he is a scholar
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I like a plain bingo game, not one that is always asking you to buy gems.  I would like a plain bingo game. thank you.
B000OHZL1W|1.0|Never seen the film but just really wanted to see it after reading cyberpunk but this copy doesn't even work so he got 99 cents and i lost a buck plus $399. It sucks to be the guy who wights a week to get riped off on the doller menu plus he never offerd to replace it but said to write return to sender for a refund... &#34;Dude U suck!&#34;
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|So if you have neighbours that won't let you use their WiFi you totally need this app. It's a ninja and I works!
B00E193TM2|3.0|Generally the music quality has been downhill since the release of their first album, \\"way of the fist\\". The 1st album was one of the best releases in recent metal history and it would be incredibly hard to see another album with that quality produced. With that said, \\"The Wrong Side..... (annoying long title)is really just a commercial album to make money. It has some gems like \\"lift me up\\" and \\"wrong side of heaven\\", otherwise repetitive and has nothing new to add to the genera. Hope they decide to do quality instead of quantity, kinda like \\"tool\\" only releases an album a couple years but it's ALWAYS awesome.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|It was great to watch season one. I had watched it in 08 but missed everything else  since then. Great show and I can't wait to see the rest of the seasons. I highly recommend to the &#34;adult&#34; audience.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is fabulous and i was so happy to be able to get it for my kindle.  Take it along
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|I don't like the fact that every time I don't want to play anymore I have to start back at the begging!!!
0670026557|3.0|I was very excited to read this book because of the impressive reviews by authors I greatly respect and the basic premise of the book.  Sadly, I have not been more disappointed by a book in some time.  It isn't a bad book per se - it is well researched and well written - but it is just silly on a number of levels.<br /><br />First, the author starts with a premise that people are generally (1) givers (2) takers or (3) matchers - and then tries to jam various round pegs into these square holes of categories.  It doesn't work.  He tries to hard to make it work and it becomes really silly.<br /><br />For example, he devotes a full chapter to some guy who has the most LinkIn connections and suggests he is successful is because he is a true giver - well, ok, it may work for him but I can think of numerous people who have tons of connections who aren't that successful.  Life is much more complicated than that.  Then he spends time comparing Ken Lay to John Huntsman and suggests b/c Lay had a bigger picture in the company profile, he was more of a taker and only cared about himself.  Again, silly argument.  I know numerous very giving people who self-promote themselves.<br /><br />Second, the book really rambles a lot.  It has some interesting anecdotes but also has material that makes little sense.  I really had high hopes for this book but it is quite disappointing.  There are much better books to read.
B003L20IFQ|5.0|Awesome movie! At the edge of my seat tge entire movie. I highly recommend to anybody who loves suspense movies.
9382951008|3.0|It was disappointing after Kite Runner and A Thousand Suns.  It skipped around so much it was a little hard to follow.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have played this game for a long time and was delighted to find it for my kindle! Thank you.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Very good read with great story line.  You can easily put yourself in the small town and story. Minimal graphic sex scenes.
0321886518|5.0|My twenty-five year old version of David Bevington's Complete Works of Shakespeare's is quite worn (and that's an understatement) so I wanted to replace it.  This newer version is more compact and therefore weighs less...nice.
B0073COMKW|4.0|Was impressed with the amount of light that was emitted. Every bulb was individually packaged.<br /><br />Negative : One bulb of eight that I ordered was defective.
B009NSHZLW|5.0|I really appreciate this app and love this app but I wish there was no adds I mean I just want to listen to music without a big pop up
B00F91SCXC|2.0|The movie lacked character development and a solid plot line. Also,Brad as an intellectual UN employee was not believeable to me. If you are looking for special effects,the movie delivers. However, I felt like I was dropped in the middle of a movie that I missed the ending to.  The special effects did pick up the slack for all of the other short-comings of this movie.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I bought it because it was on the best seller.  I like a novel that I can follow and makes sense...I am just all that into sci-fi types and didn't realize this was the genre.  I did finish it, but just because I had paid for it.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Good! I liked it was better than anything other ones I have seen. So I gave a 5 pluss it's
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was hard for me to put this book down...my house cleaning suffered I had to know what was going to happen.I would recommend others to read it.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Great movie, well done, stimulates the imagination.  I am a die hard horror fan and watch a lot of Zombie movies.  This one, I had to purchase as I'm sure I will want to watch many times.  It wasn't as bloody as I had expected but the writer leaves those details to our imaginations which in actuality scared me even more.  I can't wait for part two.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is one of the best hidden objects games I have played. I have not given it the full five stars because its lacking instructions, but that doesn't seem to matter too much. Also, you want to keep playing a bit longer,but you run out of energy too soon.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son loves to grab the money while sucking on the pacifer. The monkey keeps him entertained and very happy.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|The best season of all listening good music and melody. I wondering how Michael Bublé started and who was his inspiration behind it but I  wouldn't say anything negative because each of his CD makes me very happy. Blessings to him and his family!!!
B00EE3KMOI|5.0|Love seeing the relationships of all of the townspeople in this mystery series. It feels authentic - giving you the sensation that you're not watching a show but watching the events unfold in real time. When 11-year-old Danny disappears and his body is found on the beach of this small seaside town in England, the town is devastated. Everyone seems to know his parents as his dad is a popular plumber in town. You meet the police, the reporters and local newspaper editor, the hotel staff, the pastor, the teacher, and neighbors. It unfolds slowly and each week there are new discoveries.<br /><br />David Tennant plays DI Alec Hardy who is gruff to the point of rudeness. He is riveting. He is assisted by DS Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) who thought she was going to get his position. The relationships are complex in this film as they are in life. This isn't a gruesome story, but it is poignant as it involves the death of a child. It is tastefully done. And there is tangible suspense. It is as much character-driven as plot-driven which I like
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I put off reading this series because it was written for teens.  My daughter who works with high school students told me I should read them a long time ago.  I was not disappointed when I read them.  I was worried that perhaps I would not like the ending but I was pleasantly surprised there, too.
B00280LYIM|4.0|So far with this series goes this is the best one so far ready to read the next book in it.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book has changed my life.  &#34;Love yourself, unconditionally.&#34; &#34;Live your life, fearlessly.&#34;<br /><br />Thank you, Anita Moorjani, for sharing your life with us.
B00BPA7U34|5.0|Great music!! Spectacular singer Mr. Bublé. Thanks from bringing good melody to our hearts. Remembering all songs very refreshing in these days.
B0064MT1FI|5.0|A classic! Beautiful movie in all respects. Very sexy too! One of my all time favorites. In my movie archives of must see.
1878424319|5.0|A book that is thought provoking and simple to follow.  Keeps you on track if you choose to apply the principles to living a purposeful life.  This should be required reading for the whole human race
B000NMY7CM|4.0|Good movie, funny, entertaining, enjoyable, it's a movie I may totally forget and watch again and enjoy once more again. Thank you and watch out for the llama
B004GYY714|5.0|I love it, great music available. Haven't had any trouble with buffering. I have installed it on all my devices.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|You really fly with him. You will feel being in another place and time when you listen this music. It keeps you away from difficult moments bringing absolute peace to yiur mind. God bless him!!
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|Very addicting.  Once you start it's hard to stop.  It could be better if there was a way of keeping score.
B003E2UQMS|4.0|I would not lie when I say that I like the movie more. It is probably because I saw the movie first. The book, I felt is more depressing in some respects.<br />It is a page turner nevertheless.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought this game for my kindle fire hd and when I downloaded it it would not show up and you can not get your money back so do not buy it.
1416575464|4.0|The book is beautiful, and I think that people interesting in pursuing a career in Interior Design would benefit from reading this book.  The photos are from the magazine publications with the very same name, &#34;Domino.&#34;  I wish the publishers would bring the magazine back to the public.  It was unique.<br /><br />The book's photos are impressive.  Because the photos were taken years ago, prices of furniture and various decorations could not be included.  It is a bit pricey for what it offers, but as I said before, the photos are beautiful.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Really enjoying the series, can't wait until season 3!  Already have it on my wish list.  Follows the books fairly well
B0027MJU00|4.0|Very good &#34;first&#34; novel by this author.  She definitely goes to the dark side in this book and that makes it a real page turner.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was really good and one of the best books i ever read.<br /><br />Along with the Kane chronicles and Percy Jackson the last Olympian.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I just love this movie. It has a great story. It has great one liners, for example: Loki: That usually works. Stark: Well you know many suffer from performance issues. It is a classic hero's journey for both the hero's individually and collectively.<br /><br />Awesome music/sound to go along with the story spurred my emotions at the high point.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|As others have said: the object finding is relevant to the game and not tedious, nice graphics, not per se supernatu ral story line, it's nice to have difficulty levels.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good plot.  A typically high quality Bosch novel.  Need I say more!  There was a little oddness with the IA investigator at the end.  For instance, why did she follow Harry?  Hmm.  Enquiring minds want to know.  Couldn't figure out her motivation.
B008M87GJK|4.0|Very informative,  world wide news and up to date sport information. Well, a little glitch in the news ... &#34;United States of Texas&#34; ?? I had to laugh so hard. In Texas is everything already bigger ... now this.Keep up the good work and thz nk you.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My Little Pony is an okay game compared to the Simpson's but it is still an enjoyable game if u love twilight sparkle and her friends from ponyville.
B00AC8ZJ6K|3.0|I was basically watching it while blogging. Mostly teenagers involved, but I liked their acting.<br />Nice Computer Generated Graphics. That's all.
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|I purchased the black album when it first came out on CD.  Loved it then, love it now.  When I think Metallica, this album is the stand-out in their excellent line-up.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Every once in a while I like to read popular Fiction to expand my connection with the everyday reader. Dan Browns new work fits all the criterion that I would assign to a work of fiction. Exciting, thoughtful, and captivating.<br /><br />This book has lead me to the decision to pick up the Hebrew Bible, and the New Testament to look for clues that are hidden within its contents.<br /><br />The book is a great read, and I would recommend it for the thinking person, as well as the reader looking for a thrilling ride!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was so encouraging and thought provoking. My husband and I don't have any real struggles other then day to day monotony with work and kids, so it made the book \\"fun\\"to read because I wasn't necessarily looking for answers. That being said, I learned so many things and my husband didn't even need to read the book for our marriage to improve.<br /><br />I started speaking his love language and our patience and communication with each other improved greatly in a very short period of time. Within a couple of weeks, we were bickering less and choosing to be more considerate and responsive to one another's needs. I would recommend this book to any married couple, regardless of whether or not you feel your marriage is in trouble. I would have considered myself happily married prior to reading the book, and after finishing the book and incorporating it in to our lives, I'm excited about our marriage.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First I saw the movie and just loved it then I read the book and it was even better but I found they left some things out of the movie and I was disappointed about that but great book
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I started watching Glee on prime, I watched the first three season in 2 days...I was hooked!!  Waiting impatiently for season 5.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fifty shades darker was a surprise to say the least. Didn't realize Mr. Grey could have a change of heart. It pulls at your heart strings with the bit about him being abused.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Loved playing it.  Can't wait to get more games like this.  Love puzzle  games.  Keeps me busy and entertained daily
B001TH16DI|5.0|as with ST:  TNG bought for husband father's day/birthday.  we both love star trek but he's been watching the VHS versions.  he could not believe the difference between VHS & Blu-Ray.  everything so much clearer and more theater-quality.  the Khan movie still is his favorite but seeing the whales and hearing them in IV was spectacular.  i can't wait until i get a chance to watch them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the hunger games but I have to say this book was better and I just love the characters can't wait for the movie
B00005N6KG|4.0|I love these headphones for running. I've always purchased a few at a time because I have a cat who will chomp on the cord, if I leave them out. For $9 a pop, it didn't really bother me. But now the SAME headphones are almost $40??? That's just ridiculous. I'll miss these headphones.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|So much of the actual novel was not addressed nor could be I suppose in one movie, but I thought overall the movie touched a few highlights. Would love to see this project taken on as a series such as what has been done with Game of Thrones
B0011UGLK6|4.0|A gem. Each character is real, if even just for a few brief pages. This collection feels culled down to just bones and flesh of life's defining , fleeting moments.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has brutally damaged me, it's like we're being punished for reading his own book, nonetheless this is one story that will stay with me until I die. I loved this book very much it has changed me
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|So many plot twists a lot of surprises definitely kept me on the edge of my seat can't wait to read the rest of the series!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just read it for the third time. Two nights per book and I wish they'd never end. My favorites ever.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album is a pure Platinum classic CD, nuff said!  They don't make albums like this anymore...it brings back memories of the 80's and 90's when music was at its best....!!  Lauryn reached the pinnacle of her musical gift with this album.....every song on this album is a number one hit.....loved this album
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|It is a hit !! If you love boz you will love this I love his vocals and I feel like he is singing right in front of me
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I congratulate Mr. Card for writing an interesting and relevant sequel for \\"Enders Game\\", I really enjoyed both books.  It is true that it is a little slow in building up to the climax but not excessively slow.  Mr. Card deals with a really interesting topic of how humans relate to alien interplanetary life forms.  In the first book, humans are afraid and so we blow them up.  In the second, we try to meet them without doing damage to them and also preventing a dangerous war.  In this book it is a bureaucracy trying to do the job until Ender shows up and shows the right way to do it.  An interesting concept and well presented.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that he picked the humans to be represented by Portuguese.  I am fluent in Spanish and so I probably understood a lot more than most readers, nonetheless the names and words are often written in unusual ways with different pronunciations which makes the characters difficult to remember and distinguish.  I think Mr. Card could have achieved exactly the same thing by making it a Spanish colony with Spanish words and names.  This would have made it significantly easy for readers to understand and relate to his book.  This is why I give it a four star rating instead of five stars. The real loser here is Mr. Card because so many readers will give up on the book before getting into it, guaranteeing that they will never get to the next books in the series.  That is money out of his pocket.  Since I got through that difficulty I will continue the journey into his next books.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A fun and thought provoking book. I know I will read it many times.  It's also inspiring and uplifting and has already helped me to shift my thinking in a more empowering direction. It also lends itself beautifully to exploring and working with its principles in a group setting.
B000002H38|5.0|This album is a pure Platinum classic CD, nuff said!  They don't make albums like this anymore...it brings back memories of the 80's and 90's when music was at its best....!!  Every song on this CD is one of a kind.....Anita hit every note and feeling on each song
B000FBFN1U|4.0|There is so much going on it is hard to keep up with all the action. Going on to book 4 now. Can't wait for season 4 on HBO.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A  quick disclaimer that I listened to the audio book which I don't do very often, but I really loved it. This book had it all for me. I am a fan of time travel books as well as some historical fiction, so this covered both. Then a little romance. So really, what's not to like? The story was was very compelling and grabbed me from the start.I can't say I am a huge Stephen King fan as this is only the third King book I have read, but after this, I think I will read more. I would listen on my commute or at the gym, but then found myself so engrossed in the story that I had a hard time putting it down. The narrator was very good. If you are inclined to listen to audio books, I highly recommend. But I would assume reading it is just as good.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series far FAR surpasses the Fifty Shades trilogy with a wider variety of characters and deeper storylines . Instead of leaving you at the brink of crises the Crossfire books take you right over the edge. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a steamy book with vivid characters and intriguing plots.
B00004WX4X|5.0|This album is a pure Platinum classic CD, nuff said!  They don't make albums like this anymore...it brings back memories of the 80's and 90's when music was at its best....!!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I chose this rating because I'm in the age group this book is aimed at and I saw the writing as very elementary, in then sense of foreshadowing and such. The story it self is fine, but it's written so childish that it was a bore to read.
B00E6F155E|5.0|This is the first time I have seen this concert, I can only imagine the difference going from VHS to Blu-Ray, it was excellent. The concert and footage were excellent, I had never seen him perform some of his earlier numbers. I have always loved his band. My one bit of disappointment was him singing both parts (both male and female parts) of Don't Give Up, but for those who may not have already been familiar with the song, he still did it well. I am so glad they included Youssour N'Dour's opening set, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm very glad I bought this Blu-Ray, I definitely recommend it, but I do agree with the other reviewer in that I hope Peter comes out with some new material. I think his orchestral rendition of his material is wonderful, the Scratch My Back is an interesting concept, but I am waiting for some new material, he is such a creative, talented musician and lyricist.

B00C8YOIR2|5.0|A singular, humorous, other-worldly story with a wonderful mix of characters that are excellently developed.  A sequel would be most welcome!
0307719774|4.0|I should have read the dimensions of the journal, because when I opened the package, I was surprised that it was so small.  But, you  don't need much space to write a quick answer to fun daily questions that will help highlight changes in your life and thinking for the next five years.  These questions for adults are simple, some deeply thought-provoking and others as fun as &#34;How clean is your house today?&#34;  The small size is easy to leave out on the end table, or toss in your suitcase.  You know the friend you wish you had that would ask you questions that mattered?  This is a fun alternative - good conversations with yourself!!  LOL.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This application is nice and simple. It's easy to use and quite handy.<br />I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a simple calculator app!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a fascinating peep into the lives of people hiding something (secrets).  It does make you wonder if we need to know every little thing about our friends and family.  A little mystery is quite interesting.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this weather station, I get our state , along with two other states, where our daughter lives and also a granddaughter.  I can check on their weather as well as our own.  It is fun to see and tells so many days ahead. If you are planning a trip, this is just perfect.  Try it.  .Amazon has done it again.  Sunshine lady
B00F91RYL8|4.0|We really enjoyed it! It's a good mix of &#34;I Am Legend&#34; and &#34;Outbreak.&#34; It's not a jump out and scare you movie.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Excellent addition to my GoPro Hero 3. Everything you need is included, A must have - allows to see what your shooting, easily adjust camera settings and replay video or shots. It virtually turns your GoPro into a traditional video recorder or camera.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout has an engaging writing style. The subject matter of the book is of immense interest not only to new-age readers but to all serious thinkers and readers. It is absolutely necessay to keep the reader glued to the book from start to finish in such cases. And this job Pam Grout does very admirably. She has written an eminently readable book.<br /><br />All the experiments in the book are easily doable. In fact, for most new age readers, at least two or three experiments given here must have already been experienced in one form or the other. But we take so many things in our life for granted that we easily miss out on them when they 'happen' to us. When you read the book you will realise that you have already been through that experience. The speciality of that experience will strike you when you read the book and realise that it was not an everyday, routine experience.<br /><br />The book gives hope. Because if the experiments are indeed successful, then probably it is possible to change our lives for the better by right thinking?<br /><br />Buy the book. I am sure you will read it more than once like I did.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|my daughter loves these games! She is four and my oldest daughter 8 my oldest loves helping my youngest and they love working together now!!
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book was good but I just hate that peers was not with katniss at the end, but I'm very eager to start the next book
B000I0XLYO|5.0|What is this, a school for ants. It needs to be at least three times bigger than this. Haha ha
B003WE9TU8|4.0|I am very new to the zombie genre. In fact I had only read [[ASIN:B0070B0JW6 The Remaining]] by DJ Molles and [[ASIN:B00F83EPL4 Ground Zero: A Zombie Apocalypse]] by Nicholas Ryan before downloading my copy of World War Z. I really didn't get it. I thoroughly enjoyed World War Z the movie and so naturally bought the book thinking there would be some shred of similarity. There wasn't. I found this to be a much more difficult read than I expected although I do commend the author for his creative imagination.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie. I watched the unrated version and it was less gory then \\"The Walking Dead\\". The movie is frantic and loud. I think most summer action movies are made like this now and I don't like it. I like the slow pace of \\"The Walking Dead\\". I am also a slow zombie type and in this movie the zombies move at warp speed as well as the virus with a 12 second incubation time. Brad Pitt is very bland in this and all the other characters are just supporting him(also a producer). This movie is far from the best zombie movie but it is about average. A good watch once. The extras are just more advertising for the movie and Brad Pitt. He also made sure to be the only handsome actor in the movie. The cute young doctor was killed off after just 10 minutes.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|I really like this move it was great to watch it and learn from it. My family enjoyed the move!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I have Lindsey's station on my Pandora, and really like the upbeat music which I often listen when working. This is my first album I have bought (in the past five years) of listening Pandora.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Mesmerizing.<br /><br />I was riveted.<br /><br />I think Michael Shannon said it best about working with Jeff Nichols, the director. Paraphrased, he said, \\"One day I'll be able to say I worked with Jeff Nichols in his early days and it will be like saying I worked with Scorsese.<br /><br />Jeff Nichols power of film making is phenomenal.<br /><br />For instance, in his Movie Take Shelter. It could have been done on a low budget in a house in Iowa, yet it was riveting until the final seconds. I told people this who didn't believe me, but later confirmed it. Until the final seconds!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Love the songs on this album!  If I don't play it our teens request that I do when we drive.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|A classic! Great selection of caracters. Hilarious. Being plump can still be sexy. Great friends. Definately a chick flick. Listening to gossip can get you into trouble.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Its not normal that I like both a movie and its sequel - but this sequel does very well.  I like how they made certain twists to the plot.  Khan is more outwardly evil than in the original but the actor who plays him does an excellent job of paralleling the two movies.  It was a great all around action packed film with some dark humor.  Loved Spock and Uhura throughout the film. Wished there was more Scotty but still enjoyed what little there was of him.  Great film altogether!  :D :D :D
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Even after paying $0.99 for this app you'll have to endure ads for a calculator program made by same team. That's reason enough to rate as 1 star.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 7 year old daughter loves playing it on her Android tablet.  Now if I could just get her to put the thing down!
B00006LLNV|5.0|Great history of two leading early 20 th century Mexican artists. Through  the eyes and love of Frida, we get a good look at Diego Rivera. We also get a good insight into Mexican culture........
B00ET47USI|5.0|fun to watch, the animation.  Fun to play quick fun or play it over and over to fill more time and have more fun.<br />.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Great read. Everything just so.<br /><br />Lee Child does a helluva fine job. Story is beautifully developed, characters are finely crafted. It doesn't get much better than this in this genre.
B0053O89Z6|4.0|Without a doubt the show has shifted away from Ted to BARNEY and why not, he's AWESOME!  This is a must have for collectors.
B000002MUN|5.0|Lost my first copy of this CD and was very sad. For some reason, I associate this CD along with Bob Marley's &#34;Legend&#34; CD as festive music to listen to over the Holidays.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I just received my headphones yesterday and I'm liking them a lot, good quality sound. They headset itself is big, not saying this as a bad thing I mean that they will fit pretty much everybody, they have very large extending capabilities to fit comfortably. The 7.1 is great, but so far it only seems that it would be useful for movies. The programmable 'G' keys have already proven useful for my needs in confusing my friends by changing my voice mid-game at the touch of a button.<br /><br />Ok, the one problem I'm finding with these: They fall short when handling deep/heavy bass, I tried using the software from Logitech for this device and turned up the bass slider just a few clicks up and bass was quickly distorted and ripped. That being said, bass is still present but for those of you who a just completely HUGE bass buffs it's kind of a let down. I'm not completely sure if the bass reacts differently for different apps that I'm using (game, music, movies, etc.) where the bass sounds pure while listening to music it might rip when there is a blast in a game.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is a must read, even if you've already seen the movie.  I finally got around to reading it because I want to enjoy the sequel, Doctor Sleep.
0316069906|5.0|Officially a vegetarian, do not attempt to read this book unless you really want to know. Society makes it so easy to stay uneducated about the food we put into our bodies. Shouldn't we know exactly what goes into our food?
B008P76UKE|2.0|I already commented in my other review,but I don't &#34;dig&#34; Maazel's conducting.I find it bland and boring.<br />Compare it with La fura dels baús with Zubin Mehta conducting and you will see what I mean !
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have enjoyed all three quells.  Relaxing background music, great graphics, unique puzzles, what's not to like.<br />Bla, bla, bla.
B00004RF9G|5.0|I have wanted this movie for a long time.  I've seen parts of it but never the whole thing.  Actually I think I saw part of the made for TV version w/Peter Faulk and Sally Anne Howes.  Can't wait to see this.
B00BOL126U|5.0|this series I hope is continued on for many seasons to come.<br /><br />IT  contains all elements of great writing , story line and  history combined .<br /><br />The portrayal of depth of character and colors actors put in , is evidenced in how audience feels as if they are there along for the beat down or the dinner or the raidsLOL<br /><br />Puts fantastic visualization to the reality of a culture that most all  Americans couldn't imagine as well if this series wan not created.<br /><br />BRAVO TO u History Channel id take this over any of our MAJOR NETWORK Hot shows airing now,<br /><br />This is better  or AS good as \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" FX, sorry Sutter , still love ya too!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very good read, kept me totally engrossed.  I liked all the characters as well.  Would totally recommend this book to friends
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I had to pre-order this to make sure we got it as soon as possible for my little ones (well, 11 isn't so little). They watched it 2-3 times the first day and every day for at least a week. I just found it left out yesterday or the day before from where they had it out again.<br /><br />The idea to turn the ponies into more girl-like characters for a movie was brilliant!
B004TJ1GVK|5.0|I had this movie on VHS but finally broke down and got it on DVD.  I've seen it so many times and really enjoy the story line.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I was questionable about this game at first, but after playing it only one time, I was hooked. I encourage everyone to get Minion Rush! :)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show, is smart and funny and will keep you watching.  You will want to binge watch it like I did.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Beatifully written story that will force you to examine abilities you take for granted, as well as the meaning of life
B00B9366VO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. If you are a fan of those little snippets of information about a song a DJ will share before or after playing one, then you will enjoy this movie.
B001L5U15M|5.0|i started a few years ago with the 8x and fell in love with the way these sling bags work.  Then I acquired a bigger camera and lens.  So it was upgrade to the 9x. bag. . . .ooooooo. .. I love this bag.  It was able to carry my 7d with 70-200 attached, a 24-105, a 100mm macro and a 580 EX II flash, plus batteries, cards, my eye glasses,  a couple of dish towel to keep things wiped down.  This was and is a great, wonderful camera bag.  Perfect,. . . well some slight drawbacks. . .I wished the shoulder strap was wider and more comfortable.  Then I upgraded my camera again to a 5D mark III.  So - upgrade the bag to a 10X.  . .so glad I did.  Now with two cameras with lens attached, two extra lenses, flash, macro flash ring, cards, batteries and manuals.  Guess what, i do not need to go to the gym. . .this is a muscle builder, lots of equipment equals lots of weight.  To me, being an active photographer, moving all the time, this is perfect. . . easy access to the cameras, the bag acts as a shelf or platform to change lenses.. . easy to carry. . I love this bag.  I have other regular camera bags that just get dusty. . not these bags. . they get used. . . .hope this helps you. . . .
B002NV8KGU|3.0|Madmen Season One is fun, mainly on a stylistic level.  I love the opening credits sequence. The series is an almost-faithful recreation of the visual style and culture of the early 1960s.<br /><br />I say almost-faithful because the inaccuracies can be a little jarring.  I lived through the 60s and remember the decade clearly. The errors are a little irritating, and were bad enough to keep taking me out of the reality of the storyline.<br /><br />The timeline is a little loopy.  It's 1960, then it seems to be years later, in terms of what's going on culturally in the U.S., then it's 1960 again.  They really needed a consultant who lived through the decade, connect the dots of what happened when and what caused what to happen, because the first season at least was a mishmash with some things out of order.  And they were important things.  It's as if someone were making a movie about the first decade of the 21st century, and set the events of 9-11 after, not before, the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, or showed Obama elected before George Bush, or showed texting preceding email.<br /><br />Beatniks were not hippies.  The first season was set in 1960, before Kennedy's election, and shows the main character meeting a bunch of beatniks, but most of them are portrayed as hippies, not beatniks.  But hippies of the type portayed were a reaction to the Vietnam war and the Kennedy assassination, which did not occur, obviously, before Kennedy was elected to office. Nixon lost partly because he didn't listen to admen.  Marshall McLuhan published \\"The media is the message\\" in the mid 60s, so people would not be talking about it years earlier. The visual style of the ads the admen are creating, is more reminiscent of the mid 50s than the 60s.  The problem is that \\"one thing leads to another,\\" so getting the order wrong makes the show lose its sense of reality on a certain level.  The producers went to such trouble to get some things right, the things they got wrong are a little jarring.le jarring.
B00770KR7W|5.0|Bought this for my younger who happens to be a huge HALO fan. I loved McFarlane figures when I was growing up. The figure is great and looks nice. Great for any Halo fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movies 1&amp; 2 they are so fun the are also good for kids who have problems  but it is ok if you have problems. What is wrong with Jesse she is not a teenager Emma is the only one who is so funny and luck is so cute but he was even funnier than he was on grown ups 2 I like one and two . I definitely don't like Hannah Montana she is just wrong. My dad likes Rob  me and my dad like bleed lines. Were life I know you want it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Really good book, kept me interested. I do however wonder if when the movie is released will it be rated X...gigiti...
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of my favorites. I think that it explores a wonderful new world as well as the mind of a child. This is a fun read for anyone.
B00DQVST76|1.0|For those wondering if the DVD is defective I can assure you that it unfortunately is. The video quality is fine but the sound is defective.  The 5.1 sound does not work! What a disappointment. I just could not enjoy the concert.  Which is a shame because it is an amazing tour. I can't believe that we are given such bad quality products. And Madonna herself kept posting on Facebook & Instagram that they were working extremely hard to get this done. Well I simply don't believe it. I don't see that so-called hard work.<br />What I saw was mostly great but I did have some issues with the editing. It simply was not the best compared to Confessions or Sticky & Sweet. It seemed to jump from one frame to another frame to another too quickly. If you look at the Turn Up The Radio performance, in one frame she has long sleeves and in another frame she has no sleeves?!?! The editing was not consistent. I just kept thinking about Confessions and how beautifully that was done.<br /><br />I love the MDNA era but it simply is not being handled properly. The number of singles chosen (and yes I am aware that usually only 2 or 3 singles are usually chosen for Madonna) but I was hoping for more this time around. The lack of physical CD singles available. I'm in America, why must I keep having to purchase from the UK or Japan? I thought Madonna leaving Warner Bros. was gonna bring a change in the handling of Madonna's career but it seems like not much has changed.<br /><br />I am a huge Madonna fan and I will always be. But I just dislike the people who are handling her career. This means you Guy Oseary!<br /><br />UPDATE: I returned my DVD and received a new one. SAME ISSUE! This 2nd DVD I received is also faulty. And I just noticed that Amazon is no longer selling the DVD anymore. Only through third-party sellers. We'll see how long it takes to fix these Blu-rays/DVDs. Madonna herself has addressed the issue as well as Interscope. Although they are quickly blaming the settings & firmware. Do I have to spend my hard earned money & purchase a new Blu-ray player? According to Interscope, YES. Best solution is for them to stop releasing faulty products.<br />Hopefully this issue is resolved quickly but I'm sure they will make us wait another 6 months.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I liked the game but after awhile it wouldn't work and it said I had to re download it and I did but there were still problems so I went to a different solitaire.

B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Nice game to play on a road trip. I play at the doctor office, Time flies by so fast! You will enjoy it!
B008DVJMAW|2.0|The sound quality is not even 2nd rate.The music was good,but the recording,mixing,all the sound,comes out like mush.Do all there recordings sound like this?
B0063IH60K|5.0|a good choice of solitaire game if you like only one type, there are many others that are out there which have way more choices of games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always loved playing this game. This is a very fun game and I have been playing it every since my early adulthood. I rate it four stars.This is one of my favorite games.
B00009QG73|5.0|There was no album to promote. This tour was put together (by the piano player) simply for the love of the music of this great band. With a fine selection of tunes & a terrific group of extra musicians (the violin solo on &#34;Out Of The Blue&#34; is spot-on), the performance is wonderful. If I have a complaint at all it's that I had to buy a used copy (but it was in excellent condition). Be cautious of the dvd/cd combo-the dvd is in PAL format & won't play in NTSC players (though the cd works fine). THIS is a show to share with the entire family; Grandparents will like the dance quality of songs, youngsters will enjoy the spectacle of a classy rock show,  newcomers will recognize some of it (THIS was by THESE guys?) & the fans will be happy to have a definitive concert of this fine band.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Probably the only show that will keep me interested. The characters are great and its cool how they have changed the background of the characters but it still works. Its really entertaining
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Although this film was not your usual Tom Cruise blockbuster movie at the boxoffice, it can be further from the truth.  I loved this movie, and the story was very interesting, intelligent, just right on.  Tom Cruise was just great as Jack Reacher, along with his other co-stars especially Rosamund Pike.  Robert Duvall is always a sure thing in any film.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|I love this game  !!!! I would like for other peple to get it !!!! You will have fun !!! Love It !!!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!<br />Game is broken and crashes frequently. Wizards of the Coast and the developer, Stainless Games, have been aware of the problems for months and have made no effort to fix them or even communicate with their customers. Many customers have paid good money for the game on all the versions (Android, iTunes, Xbox, PSN, and Steam) and can't play it. Take a look at WotC's own forum thread on the problems - [...] .
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Not sure if it was a good read when I started but oh my, I was soon caught up in the story. Wonderfully written. Intreguiging.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This is a very cute game for kids and very addicting for adults also. Great way to kill some time.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My son has been counting down the days to the app release so he can teleport his figures into it and play!  He woke up the morning of the 19th and his first words were &#34;the new app can be downloaded today!&#34;  He can hardly be pulled away from it. He loves the teleport option, (Jar-Jar Binks is hilarious!) and being able to &#34;join the pork side&#34; is a new twist he can't get enough of.  Great graphics, very creative.
159562015X|5.0|Very good program to ferret out info about yourself. Highly recommend. Gets through the small stuff and helps set a program.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|As a big Sci-Fi fan, I always look for &#34;coming attractions&#34;........Max Brooks book  covers the before during and after, while the movie skims over and concentrates on the Pitt maneuver. Good action, a story line that may leave some scratching, and fast zombies!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Who doesn't like Downton Abbey?  I am already counting the weeks until Season 4 is released!  The only reason I have to give it a 4-Star rating is that I did not understand how difficult it would be for me to understand the King's English...instead of the American version.  I wish I had known what &#34;Original U.K. Version&#34; implied.<br /><br />A wonderful DVD nonetheless.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|I love this app me and my friend make a ton of keep calm posters we both LOVE LOVE LOVE this app it's worth the money!!!!!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This season was so shocking.  I can not wait to watch season 5 over again.  Great action and story line.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|I've been playing it since I received in the mail from Amazon a week ago.  True Sheryl Crow for sure, you will not be disappointed if you are a fan of her style & lyrics. Little country here & there.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Plot twists and turns and great action sequences. Not exactly your typical sic fi movie.Acting is much better than I expected.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|I love this cd so much didn't realize I already had one, untill the cd came in. Gave my extra cs to e very nice co worker.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I rated this book high because it was intriguing.  I had it on my mind when not reading it.  There is much likeness to the Book of Job.  It also shows how important God is in our lives.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I like this game. I play it as soon as I can get new lives other wise you have to pay which I'd rather wait 30 minutes for. I've had issues where this game would freeze and I have to delete and reinstall, loose all mypoints, levels and everything else. It gets kind of annoying but I love this game that I can't find any other one that I like so much. Great time killer too.

B00CL0J99K|2.0|Iron Man was my favorite comic as a kid.<br />Growing up I always wondered if technology would develop to the point to realistically bring IRON MAN to the big screen.<br /><br />Well computers and CGI has technologically made it possible ---- BUT ---- unfortunately that is about all that can be said for the IRON MAN movies.<br /><br />Impressive Computer and CGI skills ........ but weak stories, changing Tony Stark's character too much, and bad campy humor.<br /><br />The first half of the first Iron Man movie was ok, but then it collapsed to a predictable plot formula that Marvel used on all their hero films that year.<br /><br />Then IRON MAN 2 came out.<br />Ughhh ......... we won't say anymore about that one.<br /><br />NOW we have Iron Man 3.<br />The Disney stamp is all over this movie.<br />Especially with the kid who helps Tony Stark ------------ cheesy --------- classic Disney thing all the way.<br /><br />This is NOT IRON MAN !!<br /><br />yeah the CGI is impressive and I am sure that many long hard hours of work went into making this movie, but the result is a major dissapointment<br /><br />Special Effects alone DO NOT carry a movie.<br />OR maybe I am wrong and modern audiences only care about flashy eye candy and no substance.<br /><br />And they pay Downey $50 million per film for this ?<br />Tony Stark was not a smart mouthed comical wisecracking comedian --- he was a tragic character.<br /><br />Downey should say his thanks every day of his life for being blessed to be so overpaid for so little actual work.<br /><br />In the average Iron Man movie, Downey has less than 20 minutes of screen time<br />Reports are he works on site for 6 weeks making these films<br /><br />So $50 million for 6 weeks of work ?<br /><br />Insane !<br />And we have people complaining corporate executives in business make too much money<br /><br />Hmmmpphh
B00985E3UG|5.0|We all know the food industry spends millions studying the best ways to use marketing to reel us in and entice us to buy their food, but this book is a fascinating (and scary) look at how much money and energy they put into knowingly addicting us to sugar, fat and salt by making sure their foods stimulate our &#34;bliss point&#34;. There is no doubt that this country is addicted to sugar, fat and salt, and we need to get a handle on these addictions very quickly if we are to reverse the obesity and other chronic disease epidemics. Reminds me all too much of the tobacco industry, and as such we must all fight for stricter regulations on marketing to children, and most importantly, fight the Farm Bill that has contributed so much to the obesity epidemic. We simply cannot afford to continue to subsidize the products that become processed food at the expense of fruits and vegetables that could literally save our lives. Read this book and get angry and DO SOMETHING! Obesity, diabetes, heart disease (the list goes one) are killing us and are going to kill our kids if we don't do something right now, today. Write your congress people and encourage them to do away with the Farm Bill and also to implement stricter regulations to control marketing of unhealthy food to kids.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I purchased this because of a review on a local news station.  They had an interview with a person who the station said was from Google.  That person said that Google was constantly upgrading the software on this item so that it works with an ever expanding group of services.<br /><br />After I got it I found out that it did not work with Amazon videos.  Google's information about when they will add services was useless.  Amazon will only say they are working on it.<br /><br />Amazon should be even more specific about this item not working with their videos.  I am sure I am not the only customer that was fooled by this item.<br /><br />It does work well but just not as i was lead to believe.  Spend a little more money and get something that works with more services.<br /><br />Right now, this is a rip off.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Challenging and Lots of fun, really like the amount of options that you can purchase with points.  I love the Pork Side!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A great inspirational book and guideline as to how to bring thoughts into reality. I keep refering back to it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Brilliant writing taking the reader along through the beginning the end of the second war.  Living the Times in Europe and the USA the reader has a first hand account of the daily life during those years. I would highly recommend this to my 8th graders except for the sex.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Interesting bit of history brought beautifully to life. I was sorry to finish it. Every age will respond to the warmth and clear depiction of our recent past.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Wonderful story. I loved spending time in the land of Oz with Dorothy and her friends. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Awesome show, I am anxious to see all of Season 3  when it is available and pick where it left off!!!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is fast paced and will keep you on your toes!  The levels keep you motivated to move forward in the game to reach a new prize.  Best  game to stimulate the mind.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was the best book I ever read and the first I liked the movie but the book was a little bit better.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A Review by Anthony T. Riggio of \\"Proof of Heaven\\" (A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife)<br />by Eben Alexander, MD, September 21, 2013<br /><br />My wife recommended this book that she purchased from Amazon and thought I would enjoy it.  I was skeptical about reading a book on this subject primarily because everything I heard about Near Death Experiences (NDE) have pointed to chemical or neurological events in the affected person's brain.  While I believe that there is an existence after death and a part of me agrees that \\"we are spiritual beings living a human existence\\", I still have some doubts because the evidence is not completely provable, i.e., as in a Court of Law.  Paradoxically, as a believer, I have faith that God loves me and will embrace me after I die but still in one little corner of my thinking, I harbor doubts that I hope God will forgive me for when I meet Him.<br /><br />I read this book with a very open mind and the credentials of the author are not one bit in doubt.  I believe he is a most rational person who had the same questions, before his experience, we all share.<br /><br />When I read some of the reviews on both Amazon and Goodreads, I was surprised how many negative ones there were, but out of almost 6,500  reviews almost 5,000 were positive, i.e., 4 stars or better and less than 1,500 were 3stars or less.  I am not sure what this spread of reviews points out but I do believe that every reader must make up his own mind based on his experiences.  I believe that this book presentation outlines, unabashedly, his firm belief. The authors medical arguments seem plausible and certainly by writing this book he leaves his self open to greater scrutiny from his peers in the medical profession.<br /><br />I do believe that anything we say or write is open for all to take their pot shots.  I have to say, I believe his writing style was very readable and enjoyable and I did not sense condescension from him one iota.  I did not sense a self loving narcissism as one critic did.  On the contrary, I found the author to be a very humble man who knew he was going to go out on a limb both professionally and socially.  His life's experiences, being adopted and then much later in life seeking answers, did not warp his sense of being.  I truly believe he was and is a dedicated scientist/physician and has undertaken a field of study in the medical profession that is not for the timid and yes if that requires a big ego, so be it.<br /><br />In reading this short, informative as well as entertaining book, I believe that he experienced something like a NDE, though not typical of other NDE reports, and I will not take issue either way.  After all, these were his experiences and he was willing to share it with all who will read his book; the reader believing it, was not his intent but rather that he believes it.  I do believe we will never have all the answers and that is the reason we have belief systems.  I can tell you, I do feel better about the unknown because I do believe in a \\"Loving\\" God.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and give it, unhesitatingly, five stars.loving narcissism as one critic did.

B0063M22QO|4.0|So far it has been a really good game.  Interesting and keeps the mind busy during an otherwise boring time (such as airport lay over).<br /><br />  Would recommend.
0670026638|5.0|I bought this book on a whim while I was living in London. It wasn't released in the U.S yet, and I had't heard any press about it, I just knew that I read the first couple pages and was entirely in love with the narrator, a teenager named Nao writing, somewhat neurotically, in her journal while sitting at a &#34;love cafe&#34; in Tokyo. Orzeki writes Nao's voice beautifully, her anxieties and worries a piece with what every adolescent feels as they try to navigate what it means to be a grown up. But this is not at it's core a Bildungsroman, or at least not a traditional one, which becomes obvious when the narration switches to Ruth, an author living on an obscure island in Canada, a character that reminds us that it's not only teenagers who struggle with moving into an &#34;adult life,&#34; whatever that means, and the ways it can fall short of our expectations.<br /><br />To appreciate this book, you probably have to be at least a causal fan of magical realism. Her story structure reminds me most directly of David Mitchell, with it's rotating narrators and a predilection for, let's say otherworldly intervention. It is a novel about how people come in and out of our lives, and what their stories mean to us, as well as the power of narrative, the written word. So as much as it's grounded in city life vs quiet meditation, finding happiness and what it means to live in the moment, it's also about how stories choose us, and how we influence them in return.<br /><br />A real gem, one that I will treasure for many, many years. I can't wait to reread and discover more.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|As much as I love to read, I've never (knowingly) read fan fiction (although someone informed me that 50 shades is actually Twilight fan fiction...thoughts on that another time).  At any rate, this glimpse into fan fiction through Rainbow Rowell's book 'Fangirl' was a great introduction.  I've gotten so invested in fictional characters to the point where I've spun off into various 'what if' scenarios in my head, but the main character Cath actually brings these stories to life to the point where she has loyal readers awaiting her next installment.  Awkward, anxious and quirky, she is completely at ease writing about the lives of fictional characters instead of living her own.  Rowell does a great job of taking us through the challenges of this college freshman as she tries to cope with many jarring changes in her life with fan fiction as her one constant and primary source of comfort.  My one issue with Rowell's work in Fangirl and Eleanor & Park is that she does not tie up her stories in a nice neat bow.  I realize life doesn't always give us defined closure and the exact HEA we're looking for - but this is why I read fiction! :-)  So, in Fangirl we have 3 stories (Cath's, the real Simon Snow and Caths' Fan Fic Simon Snow) and I was left wondering exactly where we landed with all 3!  Maybe this is Rowell's invitation to her readers to spin off into fan fic of their own.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I've owned several mid-high end headphones over the years, and a moderate audio enthusiast. I didn't mind spending a good chunk of cash, if it really made a difference. These are easily the best headphones I've owned, or heard in the price range. Comfortable and easy to wear for hours on end. I plug mine into an M-stage amplifier, and the sound is phenomenal. As with most things in this price range, though, if you're interested you should really try out all options available. Listen to some sennheiser or beyerdynamic models in comparable price ranges and see what works best for you.
0345803485|5.0|I am very appreciative for 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy.  It opened my eyes to a world that I knew existed, but never ventured into.  Still won't, but at least she was able to take the subject matter of what used to be called S & M and shed an objective light on it.  Plus, her storyline, the part without the sex, also kept you riveted to the book.  I read the trilogy in three weeks.  Book three was the least enjoyable, more about wrapping up book 1 & 2, and I didn't find it as satisfying as the other two.  It was predictable, but good.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Brilliant brilliant brilliant. A very great story to tell how some of the greatest albums were made and where to go from there. We'll done!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Although I think John's &#34;Continuum&#34; album will never be topped, this album has well written acoustic guitar based songs.  Mellow, folky and country, the cover photo of the album is a perfect visual depiction of the mood of the album.  Enjoy.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I downloaded this for my three year old because she LOVES my little pony.....needless to say mommy has taken over and is absolutely crazy about it!!!!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Angry Birds Star Wars II - is excellent.  This version really takes it up a notch - a whole new level with multiple characters and players.  This version also lets you choose to play as the &#34;pigs&#34; instead of the birds!  Very nice -  I recommend Star Wars II for anyone that likes Angry Birds.
B00EEN7CAK|5.0|This is a quote from one of the members of the bling ring at her trial for felony breaking and entering.  I am a fan of Sofia Coppola, and I have to place this film in the context of her work.  These kids are the entitled offspring of the American autocracy, the rich.  Their aspirations are the &#34;stuff&#34; of the richer and the famous.  They have come of age as the peers of Paris Hilton whose claim to fame is in fact fame.  In taking her belongings, they become a step closer to her notoriety.  When the bill comes due, they point to each other as the leader.  Hate the world that created these kids, but do not turn away.  If we do not understand them, they will haunt us.  If we do face their reality, it mandates us to change.<br /><br />Just as in &#34;Marie Antoinette&#34;, this movie has major &#34;stuff porn&#34;.  If you recognize the brand labels, turn the mirror on yourself.  The acting could not be more &#34;spot on&#34;.  No one who has been to high school, or still does, can fail to recognize these kids with self esteem to spare, that nonetheless takes a hefty price tag to support.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My favorite book so far on the series! It is amazing! I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|Not the greatest Brad Pitt movie. Great suspense in this story though. Good for lovers of Brad Pitt, but not the only reason to see it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this all the time and I can get to play with my bro. But could use a little faster updates but anyway, it's AWESOME!!!!!!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I have already seen the 3rd season numerous times but am in the process of purchasing all three seasons of this show. This set has five discs, deleted scenes and endless hours of Zombies!!!!! Must have.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love this show was in my mommy lawyer mode when I watch this  and I am not a lawyer ...
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Great action movie with Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren.Great storyline about retired CIA operatives, fans of all these great stars will really like it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really loved this book and the characters. The story line is starting to go in so many ways it is starting to get hard keeping up with so many different characters and problems associated with each character. Still love the book but it needs to end.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|My wife and I watched this movie over and over...good to see George Clooney doing comedy, shows his versatility and talent. The song &#34;A man of many sorrows&#34; stayed in our heads for days.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I RECENTLY DOWNLOADED DUMB WAYS TO DIE AND I LOVED IT ALSO THE SONG EVERYTHING IS SO FUN AND CATCHY I RECOMEND YOU TO DWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!!!
1594746036|5.0|This is an odd, compelling book. Suddenly you are transported to the school and are mired in the same drama and terror as the characters.  And the photos set the bizarre tone for the book.  You MUST read this book!
B0010SKUYM|2.0|Downloaded this thinking it was (and appeared to be) a complete free novella.  It wasn't.  I don't like incomplete readings and even though I wasn't impressed at that point in the story I am a victim of the compulsion to see things through.  It obviously makes the author and publisher money.
B00008NG5V|4.0|Very pleasant album. Could really be considered a b-side to the first album. Well worth buying and happy to have it on my shelf
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is fun to use. It is right at my fingertips. Very simple to read and operate. It lights up your whole screen. I love the memory that display right after your finish. This is great and its free.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show always keeps me on my toes. When ever you think your done with the suspense something else is right around the corner
B00DAABKQK|4.0|It's an interesting movie, but one you HAVE to see again, as there's too much in it, too complex, and too much to understand the first time through.  If you believe in reincarnation, this is for you.
1611748755|5.0|I got this as a gift and it was a really good choice. She said that she really enjoyed it.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|Don't compare it to the book.  Its better to consider a movie all its own.  But, having given that break, its simply too much about one man.  The un-super superman who flies the world and does it all.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Does an OK job trying to separate real history from religious myths created by the Christian Churches to sell their brand to the great unwashed.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I have no idea what people are praising this for. This thing is nothing more than a basic streamer but has been given a fancy name -chromecast.<br />I tossed this in the trash and went back to my Apple TV.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I like white noise - there are several to pick from depending on what mood I'm in - wouldn't mind a few more
B0042RJWTM|5.0|What a story,What acting This is Lee Marvin at his best they could not have picked  another actor to play this part,
B003OUXECE|5.0|I will admit, I was a little late to the Bioshock universe. I just finished playing the first two games earlier this summer (almost six years after the release of the original), but I really loved the \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" like story in the games. Bioshock: Rapture uses the audio recordings from the game as a skeleton for a wonderful narrative on how Rapture was founded, built, and how it eventually disintegrated into the house of horrors that it would become. It's a complex story of how one man's idealistic vision can be so easily corrupted by human nature. If you've played the games, you'll really enjoy how Shirley fleshes out the characters - some of which you only knew through their audio diaries. One word of warning...if you are planning on playing the game...do not read this book first. It will spoil the \\"surprise\\" ending of the first Bioshock. It does create some spoilers for Bioshock 2, but nothing of consequence. A must read for Bioshock fans.
B003GAFA8S|5.0|Amazing! Love watching this movie. Wish it was free for amazon prime though! I dont think you should have to pay for it.
B005544V6A|5.0|I stumbled upon this on amazon prime instant video and instantly fell in love with it. The premise of the show along with the depth of the characters made it a very enjoyable experience.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I love doing Kakuro (Cross Sums) puzzles.  Now I have one that is as good as the book and pencil version.  No complaints, just great software!  If you love the puzzles, get this!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|It is impossible to criticize anything about this movie.  There is no reason to even rate it. A true classic.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Late at night, couldn't sleep.  so, what's a girl to do?  Find a movie and I chose this one.  Wasn't expecting it to be such a good watch, but it was.  I really loved the different story lines and how they all came together.  I'd watch it again which is a good sign I liked it.  Have a watch, you might get more than you expected too.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Never expected to love this one.  I am way out of high school, college and beyond but found this show to have wonderful, fully developed characters and a lot of social commentary.  Eric Damon did a fantastic job with the fashion and jewelry and the casting was impeccable.  It rang true and was a fun ride-now I am sorry that I finished the series-I want more!
B004TI1WME|5.0|I have used calculators since 1977 or so.  I have always had one with me and this is the best I have tested for android.  I tried lots before this, but only 1 or 2 since, I don't think I can beat this one.  All basic functions right in front of me with a 'tape' display to make sure I typed things right... Perfect.<br /><br />My favorites have been...<br />Texas Instruments SR52<br />Texas Instruments TI59<br />Radio Shack PC-1<br />Sony Clie PEG-T615C<br />Sony Clie PEG-T665C<br />Now it is &#34;Office Calculator Pro&#34; on more Phone and Tablet!!!

B00EI6E17A|5.0|This new album has proven to be as creative and amazing as all of her albums so far. Highly recommended!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game and without spending any money! The game is fun and entertaining. Building a park the way you like, without getting to a point where it says, 'want to keep playing? Buy full version.' Love this game.

B001HN697M|5.0|This movie is great! It has action, romance, and explains the back story from the 1st and 2nd movie. I highly recommend it to anyone!
B00FAJI116|5.0|This review is really for the whole series. It's great. I look forward to watching each week. The  writing is superb and the acting is so well done. I'm a huge David Tennet fan and he delivers a wonderful performance as the complicated, honorable but emotionally tortured detective trying to make peace with the case that haunts him, while trying to solve this one. In America, he would win a best actor Emmy award. This series is worth buying.  Love it

B008EKMB82|5.0|Her books are amazing! Every time I read one I get lost in the characters and their completely plausible, yet astoundingly absurd situations. I sometimes wonder if she lives in the walls of my life!!
B000K4WPCC|5.0|I have watched it 100 times and it never gets old! It's got action, romance, and comedy. Something for everyone! Highly recommend it!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Movie was excellent acting was great one heck of an entertaining movie. I'm not sure why it would stop every five minutes though to buffer?
B003VW8GT6|4.0|A good movie for sitting around and just having fun, no fancy effects or over the top on sense. Just a good romp of a western.
B0093QHWLC|1.0|It doesn't look like I can see any of your movies on my new Smart TV that I bought from you
B000W746GK|5.0|I love all the Harry Potter books and movies! Such a great story that's been translated into film. Highly recommend this movie to everyone! :)
B009IQ0TGM|2.0|I've liked some of Goulding's other stuff.  But much of this album was somewhat disappointing. The mellower and slower tunes on the track actually point out that perhaps her voice isn't as great as I had imagined.  She should stick to faster dance tunes.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|My favorite Wayne movie , classic story with great supporting actors . The ladies are strong in they're roles and James Kahn is actually funny in his first role.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I'm not quite finished yet, but I am so thankful for this book and the timing couldn't have been more perfect. The very first experiement proved these results.....  $5 found so my daughter could have a pony ride and some fresh apple cider.  An offer to buy my family groceries,  $100 worth of gift certificates to varies resteraunt along with 2 free movie tickets and so much more.  All of these unexpected blessings all happened within 48 hours.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|Fast pace for sure, action scene jump around but never a dull moment love brad Pitt plays a great hero!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Everything everyone had said it would be and more. It was an easy and fun read that held my attention. Could not put it down!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Fantastic book. Good &#34;clif notes&#34; version of how the world stole Teslas ideas and patents, but that didn't sway him from chasing after his dreams. Tesla gives me hope that there are misunderstood other geniuses out there that just need a proverbial leg up to get their ideas heard. Great read...
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Piper Kerman's account of going from Yuppie to inmate because of a youthful indiscretion that that she committed 10 years prior is fascinating!  The cast of characters in this book are as colorful as any I have ever encountered in a book.  Laugh out loud funny to a tear forming in the eye would describe the range of emotions I had as I read of the trials and tribulations that her fellow cellmates endure.  A real eye opener for anyone who doesn't know anything about the flaws of the correctional system in the U.S. Couldn't put it down!
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|The best soundtrack on the best medium! Packaging was excellent.  The LP is a very vibrant red!  The artwork on the album cover is simply outstanding!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The story is woven together beautifully and the ending did not disappoint. This is a book that envelopes you from page one.

B00EEXST2K|4.0|The movie was ok, it got the story across very well. I just would of liked to have seen the complete story versus reading about it at the end of the movie.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Great product, love it. My daughter loves this little piano, now she wants to take piano lessons. Thank ypu for this product.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This was a very well written book. Its a very difficult subject. Reading a novel about life in a cruel and restricted society is not pleasant. However the main character was able to live an honorable life in an inspiring way.  the book is also a page turner. The author let the story evolve in a way that kept me engrossed. I recommend it.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was really so interesting to see how the author  set up and developed the story in such a clean and inspirational story - not of real life today- but I was caught up in the story from the opening and enjoyed it so much.  Our children of today are much too sophisticated,  but the beauty of friends, the trust, and the lessons in life were just beautiful.  In a way, it makes one sad to think about our world today and what our kids miss out on.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Mouse is amazing. It has a crap ton of settings and options. Best of all it glows red! So good.
B000QCS9NM|5.0|I would definitely recommend reading this book and watching the movie, not necessarily in that order, but they are both hilarious, and one doesn't ruin the other.

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Found many choices for the pineapple design decor that I was looking for while redecorating my kitchen and dining area
B0009RCPY8|5.0|This two movies set was must have for this Ghostbusters fan. Not only does it contain both Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2, but also some wonderful extras, including deleted scenes and two of the episodes from the animated series. My favorite deleted scene was omitted from the end of the movie, in which Rick Moranis asks Sigourney Weaver repeatedly if they had been making out while posessed by Zuul. Too funny!
B00DDZ5ML6|5.0|Puss in Boots is a great movie and keeps the funny sense of humor from the Shrek movie series. My two year old daughter watches this movie over and over, it's her favorite and one of mine as well.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|My boss asked me to read this book and join a book club involving all of the big wigs in my company and I was petrified. After reading this book and only one meeting so far, it is amazing to me how many powerful woman were just as scared as I am now. It has been a life changing opportunity to realize, I doubt myself because I was raised that way and I have the opportunity to change it! I have an amazing man that supports me, and after reading this I realize I support his choices to enjoy,cooking,cleaning and staying home a lot less that I should ! I am part of the problem and vow to help fix it!

044022425X|5.0|One of the 7 \\"big books\\" in the Outlander series.  Diana does an unbelievable job of sharing this period of history through the Frasers of Fraser's Ridge, NC.  Beautifully written fiction with a non-fictional look at this historical period.

B007LYB4BC|5.0|Vinyl:<br />Another reviewer claimed that the record loses its vibe when heard on vinyl, I am here today to tell you that is patently wrong. This is probably the best brand-new music I've heard in years. In fact I am having a very hard time concentrating because of how hard my head is bopping.<br />I'm that cheap guy who buys old records from thrift stores and considers $3.00 too much for pretty much anything, but I have not regretted this purchase once. This is a very good record, filled with beats and bepop's and soul.  The fact that it comes with a free digital copy of the whole album is pretty much just icing.<br /><br />If you are a person who enjoys life or music, this is the record for you.<br />And if you're on the fence, listen to it on spotify of pandora or whatever you have. That's what I did.<br /><br />--Jacob
B008RJFRTK|5.0|This works great on Kindle Fire HD. The full version is well worth the price. I'm in Europe for an extended time and it will be so helpful as I travel. I especially like the search and pin features, and the public transportation info is nicely detailed - it's great to be able to see individual train and bus stops on this map.  The maps load very fast when zooming and searching.

B003IDMUVI|2.0|Compared to the many other Grisham novels I have read, this one is a flop. A true story, but spoilt in my opinon  far too much extraneous detail which doesn't add to the story line.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|When I started reading this book, I set it down after chapter 3 and store it was the worst book I had ever picked up. However, I had to keep going to see if it started to make sense......and I'm so glad I did!<br />At first the book is nothing short of confusing, as every chapter is like the start of an entirely different story. As you continue to read, things begin to connect and fall into this exciting and crazy web these characters have spun.<br />I couldn't put the book down!! The events keep coming, just filling in more of the mystery!  The characters and their respective stories/backgrounds are wonderfully well developed and you can't help but feel as if you know them and may relate to some of their troubles.<br />I can't say enough about this book!! It was a fantastic read and the ending was a perfect close. I would recommend this book over and over again!!
B00063EMJG|5.0|Best cd ever video is disappointing since all it is a record player spinning records was hoping to see Neil perform but still worth it

B004RKXHZY|4.0|3.5/5 Stars<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door was a cute, light, fun read. While it didn't take my breath away, I found myself grinning a lot during certain portions of the book and I really enjoyed it overall. I'm still definitely happily awaiting book number three in this \\"trilogy\\" (the books aren't exactly sequels - more like a series of companion novels) and can't wait to see what else Perkins has in store for us.<br /><br />The negatives:<br /><br />The comparisons.<br />Unfortunately, there's no way around the fact that any second book in a series is going to be compared to the beloved first book. This is definitely the case with Lola. Honestly, if I had read this book with no expectations whatsoever, it might have earned 4 stars from me. Or, possibly, if I had read Anna a bit longer ago. But, neither of those things were true and I just couldn't help but compare. While this second book was good, it just didn't quite measure up to my expectations. I felt a little bit like I was reading a story very similar to Anna, but from the other perspective. In this case it is Lola herself who is in a serious relationship and finds herself falling for another boy. Which brings me to the other boy...<br /><br />Max.<br />Okay, so you know right from the start that this book is about Lola and Cricket, so you know that Max is out the door no matter what. But, Max actually seemed like a really cool, put-together, reasonable character until toward the end of the book when he suddenly seemed to transform. I mean, he put up with a lot for Lola and I had to give him credit. And Lola did nothing but lie to him, so even when he turned into a jerk, you almost couldn't blame him. (Almost).<br /><br />Almost too cool.<br />This sounds a bit strange, I know, but I felt like Perkins tried just a little too hard to make her characters cool and edgy. The rock-star boyfriend, the girl who dresses crazily and marches to the beat of a different drummer, the hip-dressing yet geeky boy next door with a kooky name, the gay dads - all together it felt like just a bit too much. Maybe it's a generational thing (since I'm older than the target audience), but I couldn't relate to most of these people and I don't know a lot of teens who would.<br /><br />Neutral:<br /><br />Lola.<br />Unfortunately, I didn't always think that Lola herself was the most likable of characters. She whined a lot and she lied to get what she wanted (or to avoid figuring out what it was she wanted). I was very happy that other characters sometimes called her out on her behavior - We were supposed to dislike Calliope during most of the book, but I couldn't help but agree with her when she reamed Lola out. Lola's dad was also a good voice of reason and called her out on her lying and the way that she treated Max and I was glad that someone did it. I do think that Lola grew and I liked the message that the book sent about accepting yourself and not trying to change to suit others, but I can't say that Lola was my favorite character.<br /><br />What I loved:<br /><br />Cricket.<br />I really loved Cricket - maybe because he reminds me of a grown-up version of my son - an extremely smart kid who can't stop moving and might be a teensy bit behind the curve socially. Cricket is the perfect example of a gifted teen boy - not the type who typically gets the girl. And I loved him!! He was amazingly supportive of Lola (even when she didn't really deserve his support) and sweet and completely lovable. I rooted for Cricket every step of the way and wanted nothing more than happiness for him.<br /><br />The romance.<br />Like I already said, I LOVED Cricket, so it's no surprise that I loved the idea of Cricket and Lola together. I found myself grinning through practically every scene where Cricket and Lola were together - and luckily there were lots of them.<br /><br />Anna and Etienne.<br />Yay! It was so fun to see these two again. While the book didn't revolve around them, they were big enough characters that we were able to get our Anna and Etienne fix without them stealing focus from the main plot.<br /><br />I thought that Lola was a really good follow-up to Anna and the French Kiss, but it just doesn't quite live up to the original. Still, it was a sweet book in its own right and taught some good lessons about being yourself. Overall, I would give this book 3.5/5 Stars.gh characters that we were able to get our Anna and Etienne fix without them stealing focus from the main plot.<br /><br />I thought that Lola was a really good follow-up to Anna and the French Kiss, but it just doesn't quite live up to the original.

B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|There is something special about \\"Downton Abbey\\". It has all the trappings of a typical British costume drama, but it's got an extra spark that's allowed it to travel overseas and find great success here in the United States. I am a male in his 20s who enjoys dark TV shows like \\"Dexter\\" and \\"Breaking Bad\\" - on the surface, I'm not exactly in the demographic you'd think would be interested in \\"Downton Abbey\\". But I gave the show a chance, and I really enjoy it. So I'd encourage you to give it a chance too. Between \\"Downton Abbey\\" and the BBC's \\"Sherlock\\", I think Britain has two of the best shows of recent years.<br /><br />As with any great TV show, \\"Downton Abbey\\" has a strong narrative and well-written characters. One thing that sounded a bit off-putting about the show was the idea of rich folks living in their castle with a bunch of servants. But as you watch, its obvious that the Crawleys (who own the estate) care very much for their staff. And when financial troubles hit the family, they do their very best to keep all their staff on payroll. They consider it their duty, and even their honor, to employ as many people as possible and treat them well (this is something that large companies today could learn from).<br /><br />One of the most fun aspects is that this world is unfamiliar to most of us. The show's timeline so far spans from 1912 to the early 1920s. People spoke, dressed, and acted differently than they do now. Various world events from the time period are referenced in the show - the sinking of the Titanic and the British campaigns of World War I are two in particular that greatly affect the series and its characters.<br /><br />This show feels very cinematic - the locations, the costumes, the sound design and the music are all fantastic. Despite TV programs having limited resources, this show is an example of what talented directors can achieve on a modest budget - the show feels every bit as grand in scope as a Hollywood feature film.<br /><br />** If you're a Prime member, you can stream all three seasons for free right now on Amazon Instant Video.If you're a Prime member, you can stream all three seasons for free right now on Amazon Instant Video.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Being a fan of Louise Hay's books, I took her advice and read this book, and just loved it! It's filled with truth and proven methods. Anyone who wants to learn about the Law of Attraction and how it works must read this wonderful book. Being a Law of Attraction author myself (I wrote \\"MANIFEST YOUR MILLIONS: A Lottery Winner Shares his Law of Attraction Secrets\\" on Kindle and paperback), I could relate to everything in this book. It was clear, easy-to-read and filled with helpful information and does a great job of explaining how quantum energy works in our day-to-day lives. I would definitely recommend this book!
B004XWLN20|2.0|Like the other reviewers say, this is the worst packing of a dvd set ever.  For over two hundred dollars, there shouldn't be a single scratch on any disc surface.  Sadly, this is not the case.  About half the discs in my set have scratches, from minor to moderate.  Fortunately they all play, but I spent over FOUR hours hand buffing said scratches.  Luckily, I know what I'm doing.  Warner Brothers should have done a recall on this set.  One of my pet peeves is how poorly manufacturers treat the all important disc surface.  I have yet to encounter a nick on the label side of any disc from any purchase, but far too often disc surfaces look like they've been used for roller skating.  This could have been a nice set, but the packaging is sadly deficient.  And I am concerned that the label side with the disc numbers are imprinted on the discs in such a way that you can actually see the numbers on the reverse side by holding them up to the light.  I hope this \\"bleed over\\" does not cause playback problems in the future.  Manufacturers, quit trying to be so fancy.  Just give us unscratched discs in simple packing that's easy to access.  The Smallville discs are bunched up tighter than Barbara Stanwyck's corset in some old '30s flick.  I removed all my discs from the tight packaging and put them in single envelope sleeves.  What a nightmare.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Best book of the series thus far, I can't wait for the new volumes to come out. A great read!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|The intertwining stories of struggle, love and life combined with breathtaking cinematography makes this seemingly too long film a spectacular movie experience. I highly recommend it.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|At first glance, John Scalzi's Old Man's War could have easily been just a loose remake of Starship Troopers with one intriguing wrinkle to it. To be sure, that wrinkle is a great one - Scalzi posits a future in which senior citizens are volunteering for the chance to join a fighting force dedicated to intergalactic colonization in exchange for new youth (of a sort) - but the book could easily have been about nothing more than people coming to appreciate the power of the military and understanding the impact of combat. Instead, though, Scalzi makes his book much more, using his characters - and at all times, this is a book driven by characters - to explore this universe, using their eyes to filter our perceptions, and using their lives to shape our emotions. These are not blank slates, or combat-ready young people looking for meaning; instead, as the title suggests, these are old men (and women), and that fact isn't just used as a gimmick for the story - it's used as one of the central points, as their past lives and their experiences shape how they interact with each other and the universe. And then, just when you have a handle on Old Man's War, the book transforms into something very different in its final third, as Scalzi expands his world in a wholly unexpected direction that allows him to explore ideas about destiny, memory, and what it means to be human. Of course, me going on and on about all of these themes might leave you feeling like this is a heavy, dense book, but that couldn't be further from the case. Old Man's War is a blast to read - it's fun, enjoyable, witty, effective, and wonderfully paced in such a way that kept me ripping through the pages. It's great science fiction in the vein of someone like Asimov or Clarke, who could take these ideas and marry them to a wholly human story and create something more than the sum of those parts. I'm eager to read more John Scalzi - if this is any indication, I've got a lot of good reading ahead of me.

B0028IDXDS|1.0|I thought this would be a great idea for a young baby that can not hold his pacifier. It turned out to be a terrible idea and a waste of money. Directions are to wash the pacifier in warm soapy water and wash the monkey in the machine (see the issue?). The pacifier is sewn into the monkey's mouth so if you want to change the pacifier it can't be done unless you want to remove the stitching and sew in a new one.<br /><br />Also, the monkey looked much larger in the pictures; it's actually very small.<br /><br />This is a good idea that needs some imagination to make it workable.

B002QFYJF4|5.0|Do you like great characters (&#34;Better Call Saul&#34; comes to mind), great writing and great acting? You're sure to find someone in this ensemble cast you can relate too. Cruise,Philip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Macy and others are superb in a movie that relies on the theme rather than one or two characters. It's like watching a group therapy session that challenges you to connect them all together. From the same guy that gave you Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood. Amie Mann's songs add to the mood. This is about real people not super heroes with a twist of fantasy.

0393324818|4.0|I liked numbers and economics, and Lewis is a great storyteller, so this book is recommended for lay readers of both the sporty and nerdy persuasions.<br /><br />Reading this book, however, made me think of the Lucas critique: \\" Given that the structure of an econometric model consists of optimal decision rules of economic agents, and that optimal decision rules vary systematically with changes in the structure of series relevant to the decision maker, it follows that any change in policy will systematically alter the structure of econometric models.\\"<br /><br />Basically, there was a very small window where changing the paradigm on what is important in a baseball player and his statistics would give a team an advantage on the field.  Unlike the market twhere you have 250 trading days a year, you only have one draft a year, so there is a chance that the underdog can win.<br /><br />The Oakland baseball organization had some success with this smarts and analytics over just looking at guys.  But they didn't win the ultimate prize, and then a more powerful organization came and took the methods and leveraged their money plus the analytics into a championship.  Once this happened, the methods have spread and become utilized much more widely so there is no longer an edge to looking at a player's defensive WAR because everyone looks at that and it is discussed in the sports pages.

1400069289|5.0|I have first remark, before anything else, at how well this book is written.  Subject matter aside, I read a fair number of books by economists and social scientists and writers writing about those subjects and most are passable.  This book, however, is written by a writer who has full command of the language and his own voice.<br /><br />The rest is just gravy - which I ate up.  The Power of Habit as a book blurs the line through science and self-help without being too heavy-handed in either direction.  Duhigg breaks down stories about how habits are created and reinforced at both a personal an institutional level, and described people who were able to break negative habit loops and create positive habits of being in their place.<br /><br />I offer no specifics here, but I recommend this book, and I do so giving it high praise.  I often read these sorts of books in a vacuum, a dispassionate observer that I imagine myself to be.  This book, has made me rethink some of my own routines, and made me wonder how I can change the payoff from some of my negative customs.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely recommend. So much truth brought to light devils advocate style. John green is an author I look forward to
1781162646|5.0|This book is one of the best I have read from Stephen King. He has had some good books in the last decade, but this one is a masterpiece of story telling. A must read for the lovers of the genre!
0807014273|4.0|Within the covers of this book is a very moving, powerful story about survival and creating a reason to go on even when the worst is facing you.  That there were any survivors from the camps shows the resilience of the human soul.  That part is very, very good.  You should read it and be prepared to feel conflicted about your fellow man, who is capable of such highs and lows.<br /><br />Also in the pages of the edition I have are two addendums.  One is an introduction to Logotherapy, a therapeutic method that Frankl was instrumental in developing.  Another is a \\"Case for tragic optimism\\".  I don't know what to make of these so much.  The narrative that is the core of the book is only 99 pages.  The other two sections feel like filler, and I don't think they aided my understanding of the narrative any better.  I'm most concerned about the Logotherapy section.  It seems to have been highly influenced by Frankl's life experiences, but I don't know how useful it is.  The section was written in 1980, over thirty years ago now, and I worry that what was written then has perhaps been superseded by subsequent research and work.  The problem here is that I have no background in the discipline, so I can't know.<br /><br />Basically, stop at this sentence: \\"The crowning experience of all, for the homecoming man, is the wonderful feeling that, after all he has suffered, there is nothing he need fear any more - except his God.\\"  Then  you will be just fine.
B00AYB0SQQ|4.0|This movie is very good.  The cast is pretty to look at and there are some young 'stars' in this film who bloomed.<br /><br />It's a solid film guaranteed to be enjoyable (*actual guarantee does not exist).<br /><br />If you have any interest in sci-fi or horror, you are really gonna like this.  It's not a stunning film but it wasn't meant to be.  It's not going to make you think or ponder the meaning of life, but it's not meant to be.<br /><br />It's a standard, high-quality hollywood production that you will enjoy and forget about a day later.  While it does have somewhat a predictable plot, it's still high-energy and.. well.. it's a popcorn flick.<br /><br />So make your Orville Redenbacher's popcorn, sit back and enjoy.  It's worth it.

B00F88U4J6|2.0|The problem with the free version of Moon+ Reader is that it doesn't allow you to bookmark a page. This should be a standard feature on ANY reader program, free or not. The limitations on the free version kept me from doing any in-depth work with the app. Apparently the pro version gives you lots of useful bells and whistles, but with the abundance of free ereader apps out there, I don't see any reason to pay for this one. I currently use Aldiko, and it's not bad, but my preferred program is FBreader
B000002IO1|5.0|Actually, I was only interested in the song, &#34;Black Velvet&#34;, but I am enjoying the whole CD.  I heard her on my Siruis radio while in the car, and loved the song.  She has a very different voice, and the instrumentals are wonderful, especially the electric guitars.
B000002H7I|5.0|The first and last tracks of this album are simply superb. The title track with its infectious rhythm and righteous-tone is balanced by the final song with its slowly-building, deep-felt regret for moral failings. \\"Fast Cars,\\" Tracy Chapman's career-defining hit single from the album prior to \\"Crossroads\\" seems to overshadow everything that she has released in subsequent decades and made it impossible for her next album to exceed expectations. But in the absence of those heightened expectations, this album must be seen as a songwriting tour-de-force.

B008JEJPSC|5.0|My 3 year old grand daughter loves this classical movie.  We watch together at the end of the day to settle down and she usually ends up falling asleep because she is mesmerized by the singing and dancing.  Great family favorite!<br /><br />Oh and it is wide screen and the sing along is in the special features ... it doesn't interfere with the movie at all.

1489559396|5.0|Beyond Oria Falls (Dwellers of Ahwahnee - Volume 2) by Author Sheryl Seals<br /><br />Having recently read and reviewed Beyond Bridalveil Fall (Dwellers of Ahwahnee), I was quickly drawn into the story line of this second novel as the main characters were so familiar to me.  Oria previously discovered on her eighteenth birthday that she is the Golden Queen Fairy who has been endowed with many special gifts. In a battle between good versus evil, Oria leads the Dwellers of this quaint village to victory over the evil Ala. At this time, her soul mate Grey Wolf mysteriously vanishes and is thought to be dead. Oria never gives up hope of finding him alive.<br /><br />\\"Beyond Oria Falls\\" starts off in one fluid stroke going from the first book right into the second one with Oria catching site of Grey Wolf. This is only the second time she has spotted him since his disappearance and both times he flees from her. It is beyond her comprehension as to why he would do this but she listens to \\"her soul instead of her heart\\" and does not pursue him.  Oria needs the guidance of the Great Spirit in order to follow through with his plans for her.<br /><br />I am an absolute lover of quotes and the wisdom that many of them denote. I can sense deep wisdom in this fictional novel and also an appreciation for the sagacity of others. The desire to learn and benefit from the experience of others is the belief of the elders in this quaint village. When Oria describes her biological Grandmother and Elsu her accepted Grandfather, she adeptly states...\\"They both like to hang onto a good quote they've heard in their past somewhere, then give them to me when they feel it will help me understand the situation better.\\"  Oria highly regards and respects both of them and the influence and guidance they offer her in shaping her character in order for her to assume her full role as the Golden Queen Fairy and all that it entails...<br /><br />White Bear, her dear and precious friend who has taught her much about ancient healing, does not appear to be himself when Oria meets him on the path to Oria Falls. He encourages her to come to the cave behind the falls to see some strange paintings on the walls but Oria is not comfortable with this idea. She is plagued by a negative feeling that she just can't shake. She must talk to Grandfather to better understand Great Bear's motives and to receive his advice.  Grandfather encourages her to stay clear of the cave until he meets with the elders to get to the bottom of things. White Bear takes things into his own hands and does what he must do...<br />.<br /><br />Once again, talented Author Sheryl Seals takes her readers on a magical journey as they travel with Oria on her enthralling and enchanting quest.  If you've read the first novel in this series, you will not be disappointed with the second installment. The first one left me wanting more and the second one delivered. With an expert hand, this author captivates her readers right from the get go and has them hanging on to the last page. I certainly had every desire to see the final outcome and I'm sure \\"Beyond Oria Falls\\" will entice and captivate many other readers as well.  One should always try to remember that \\"The Great Spirit speaks to those who silence their minds long enough to hear him\\".  Yes...there is much wisdom in this incredible novel filled with ancient beliefs and symbolisms that enhance the storyline and draw in the discerning reader who is eager to learn from our ancestors.  It is fitting to end this review with another quote from this book filled with wisdom. \\"You have to master the past in the present, or your past will master your future...and the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past.\\" Once again, just as in the first novel, there is a cliff-hanger in the final chapter which has left me wanting more. Thank you to this author for sharing her \\"gift\\" with all of us!<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00F6YPFAU Growing Up & Liking It]]tte<br />[[ASIN:B00F6YPFAU Growing Up & Liking It]]

B000HF6XV8|5.0|This is a classic story.  I love the book more than the movie, but having read the book so many times to children and grandchildren I bow to the beauty of this video.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easy to access unlike Yahoo Mail on the Kindle Fire.  Plus, I am able to send, retriveve, and read all of the content without fail.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|GREAT movie!  Action packed, little scary.  Can't beat Brad Pitt  If you liked &#34;I Am Legend&#34; you will LOVE this movie  ( not for small children)
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|First, I have to say how happy I am to have reached the end of this tale. I started with the first book in what I thought would be a trilogy 23 years ago. I am grateful to Mr. Sanderson, Mrs.  Jordan,  and the publisher for bringing this to completion. Robert Jordan was like an old friend to many of us who knew him only through his writing.<br /><br />Fans will be familiar with the &#34;leaping&#34; style in which this story is presented. Just as the drama builds in one character's story line, we jump to another character. This practice is familiar to anyone who watches television series these days.<br /><br />The authors did a fine job of weaving the loose ends of the previous books together. Some underlying events occured in volumes I read so long ago that I didn't remember, but were easy enough to follow.<br /><br />The final tale brings the multitude of characters into a single event at last, as they fight the Final Battle. As a retired soldier, I saw flaws in the premise of some battle plans, but as it served to heighten the drama,  it worked out for the best. I won't spoil the ending for you, but I did see a spin off in the making!<br /><br />I am a Sanderson fan, and look forward to his future endeavors.
B00B2270P8|5.0|One of the best movies of the series!!<br />You can go wrong with this movie,  Great chick flick!!<br />LOVED IT!!
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I thought this was a free app. I've been using it for weeks and suddenly without warning it stopped settling off the alarm sound. It appears I now have to pay to continue using it. It's a good thing I woke up on my own this morning or I would have been late to work and it would have been the fault of this app. I am looking for another alarm clock app that I can depend on.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|It hangs up and hoses up your Kindle when you pause it and try to start play later.  Pretty frustrating!
B00D2CYV9E|5.0|I've seen the movie on HBO and it's excellent which is why I give it 5 stars.  However, there is a major problem the blu-ray disc version of this movie.  At least BOTH copies of the disc I received ARE DEFECTIVE.  THEY WILL NOT EVEN LOAD IN TO 5 BLU-RAY PLAYERS I'VE TRIED (2 Oppos, a Momitsu, a Panasonic and a Samsung).<br /><br />This is annoying as hell.  Amazon has allowed me 2 returns and hopefully the next copy they send me will play.  But I have this feeling the third will amount to the same thing.  Yet I have seen where anyone else is having a problem with this disc playing.<br /><br />Please SHOUT if you're having the same problem as me.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was book 3 in the &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; series. The book opens up with Ana and Christian on their honeymoon in the south of France. Christian is having problems letting go and his need for control. Ana is also having a hard time dealing with Christians control problems when they come home from their honeymoon after leaving Christian's parents house they are followed and end up in a high speed chase. Christian gets upset because Ana wants to keep her name at work she is now also an editor at SIP. Jack Hyde breaks into the apartment to kidnap Ana but she is out with Kate and gets in trouble for it. Two of Christian's exs pay her a visit at work. The couple went through a lot in this book. Christian who use's sex to deal with it all and it was hot I loved the sex scenes in this series. Ana's Dad Ray was in a serious car accident and had a heart attack during surgery. Ana forgets her shot and she freaks out when the doctor tells her she is pregnant. Christian doesn't take the news well at all he runs into Mrs. Robinson and comes home drunk and Ana is pissed and she has every write to be. Jack gets out on bail and he has Elizabeth kidnap Mia so he calls Ana and demands money and in doing that she tells Christian that she is leaving him. Ana puts a stop to Jack and Elizabeth after Jack hits her she shoots him. This was a good book and a good series that I was sad to see it end. Christian and Ana have both come along way I was also happy for Kate and Elliott. This book opened up a whole new genre for me BDSM and since my first reading of this book I have read a lot of really good books in this genre. I think that for me this series opened up something personally for me in my sex life. This is a series that I will also want to reread or listen to it on audio.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Storyline is similar to past original and sequel and sometimes you can't tell which bots are the bad guys during the fighting sequences.  Some of the bot characters are humorous and keeps the scenes moving.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed this book because of the different perspective that it offers. I honestly couldn't agree with the way the characters handled situations yet it was intriguing to see the story unfold. It reaches the limit of what a person will do to preserve the life they are living.<br />A great read that challenges the reader to look at things upside down, inside out and backwards.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book it's one of my favorites. Christian Grey is hot and sexy and rich he is also dark and a sadist he is also a broken and abused soul who used BDSM to manage his anger. He was used by Elena at 15 Ana who I still found it hard to believe she was a virgin she put up with his ex Mistress and his ex sub and her crazy boss and Christian wall came down I loved it
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Nicely written novel. Descriptive language, lovely imagery, sharply drawn characters that came to life on the pages. At times it felt like it was written for young readers, other times it felt more like a regular grown-up novel. If you enjoy a well-crafted story with some magic sprinkled in, you'll like this book.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Great story, easy read. Makes you think about love, life and gratitude. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain some perspective.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved this book this is my first BDSM book and I was hooked. I did find it a little hard to believe that a virgin would consider doing this and I know that Christian has some demons in his closet. I really liked this book

B0000CDLA7|5.0|Excellent album, not for beginners, their heavier album and contains in my opinion two of the best songs the band has released, Stream of Consciounesss and In The Name Of God .... the second best album of the decade DT , 2000.

So I couldnt answer all, which makes me feel probably the result could be different.<br />In general im happy with the book and test.
B004WO774M|5.0|I love it. I love the whole Harry Potter series. I think it's time for another movie night! I love it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just beautiful. I loved every word. It touched me so deeply. I am looking forward to reading more by John Green.
B008GODP04|2.0|This was a recent book club selection. I started reading and had a very hard time to continue. Just no interest in the main character, or any of the characters she writes about,  run on sentences that would last a page,  and although I finished it,  thought that there was really no character development, and I ended up thinking why did I even bother? How was that for a run-on sentence? That was nothing compared to what you'll find in the book!<br />Don't recommend unless you are stuck on a desert island with only one book.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Excellent read. Awesome book.<br /><br />Thanks for enlightening us on the life and times of the greatest minds of the 20th century.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|If you enjoy Sudoku you'll enjoy this app. It's not quite as challenging as some of the more difficult Sudoku puzzles, but it still makes you use problem solving and pattern recognition skills. My only complaint would be the leaderboard appears to be hacked our someone found a way to cheat themselves to the top and it's never been corrected or reset.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|I'm not a huge Deadhead, but I'm a HUGE fan of this set.  The CDs are well done and the band was on it's game that night. Bob was singing in tune the whole night!  The Dark Star, which other reviews rave about, is awesome. Cohesive, tight, and seems to go somewhere.  Somewhere I wanted to go.  I'm not a fan of some of the sloppy, nonsensical Dark Stars that are around.  But this one is worth hearing.  The 'cat is a good one too. Uptempo and funky.<br /><br />The highlight for me is the \\"Sing me back home\\".  On the DVD it's pure magic.  The grainy footage of a young Jerry looks so cool.  Donna sounds so soulful.  Jerry's solo nearly brings me to tears.<br /><br />The other thing that really comes through in this set is what a great bass player Phil is.  His playing is key to many songs.  He's really the \\"Jerry Garcia of bass guitar\\".
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game played for one hour  straight  totally recommend for any age  the next day I played it after six hours straight
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Does not exactly follow the fairy tale but contains familiarity with lots of new twists and turns. Special effects are believable and action keeps you on your toes to the very end.
B006CHML4I|4.0|Very Good timepiece from Seiko plus at the price it is a steal for an automatic watch.....A little small but a good sport or outdoor watch...all materials are first class!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Good opportunity to watch all episodes in sequence without commercials...thanks...looking forward to the continuing saga of The Goodwife in the future .
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is one of the best puzzle games available.  I like that when I have to  leave it I can come back and have not  lost any work. There is a wide variety of puzzles to add to this, your enjoyment can be never ending. Then you can change the size and turn on or off the ability to turn the pieces around which can make it more difficult. I also like that there is not the &quot;shadow&quot; of the picture there on the board, you can look at the picture, but you can delete it away.  I always felt it was like cheating with something to copy right there, it adds to the challenge without it there.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was surprised at the ease of setup for this remarkably inexpensive TV add-on. Once it has more streaming options, this will be a five-star accessory. Still it's a bargain I recommend strongly.
B008476HBM|5.0|Always love the classics, the length is tedious and sometimes hardtop follow after you lay it down for day or 2,
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Angry birds is fun and Star Wars adds more fun to it. And it's easy to learn how to play.
B007456F3U|4.0|When my son in law got this gift in the mail from the third party company that sent it through amazon, the receipt had some strange man's name on it and nothing indicating that it was from us.  When he googled the name, it turned out that the person had died so they probably returned the package and never removed the old invoice and just reshipped it out to the next person without including us as the purchaser.  How creepy was that!!!??
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This was very heartwarming story, which capivated the the kids.  A important lesson in friendship and love was actually picked up by the kids.  Highly recommended for the entire family.  Bring tissue...
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Never thought of a what a \\"normal\\" woman might experience in prison? That 's what makes this a pretty good read.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Rio is a wonderful family movie with a fun story about dealing with obstacles, determination and conquering your fears, and of course two sweet love stories.  Bright colors, festive music and cute characters.  My two year old has been addicted to this movie for a year, we've definitely watched it over 150 times.  And honestly, as an adult who enjoys animated films, I never get sick of watching/listening to Rio.  Highly recommended.  We are super excited for Rio 2 which comes out in 2014.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Its so cool that everybody has to buy it in the whole wide world.  It is so cool thateverybody has to buy it.
1847946240|4.0|This is a very nicely written, researched, readable, night stand work with a positive message. The information explores the process and creation of habits on many levels from individuals in their personal lives to how individuals have re-shaped corporations like Alcoa all by changing keystone aspects of habits. There's a lot about the foibles and good hearted-ness of humanity here.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|So I bought this with little hopes in liking it but I really enjoyed reading it!!!!  Of course the zombie dreams I had after reading was not something.  I would say I love it but it did drag at parts.  Especially near the end.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is amazing.  It's awesome, fantastic, and I recommend it to EVERYONE (over the age of like 5).  It has great quests and plenty to cook.  This is the best lava game ever!!
0061537969|5.0|Can I rate this book 6-Stars? 7-Stars? I wish. This is the third time I've read it, and I am still impressed with the ease that a reader can believe that Enzo, the dog-as-narrator, is human. And Enzo tells a great, compelling story.<br /><br />One-sentence synopsis: As a puppy, Enzo watches his owner transition from bachelor to husband, all while juggling a racing career and a family.<br /><br />Voice is authentic to that of a dog and a human. Because everyone's actions ring true, you root for families to stay together and cars to win.  You also mourn the heroes' poor judgments just as you wish villains' evil plots will fail miserably.  You praise the dog and suffer with his frustrations.<br /><br />Because of the author's strong writing, Enzo could be anyone of us.  Pointing out human frailties is easy and safe to do because its from the perspective of a dog.  We can learn a lot from Enzo, some great insights into human behavior.  My favorite is 'humans don't listen, they are always in a rush to interrupt and talk, take time to pause and really listen so a story is just a story and not about you.'  It's a seamless combination of human thoughts and dog reactions or imagined reactions and thoughts.  Much like Erin Hunter's \\"Warriors\\" series, you will never look at dogs the same way again.<br /><br />The ending is satisfying.  It's not a \\"Hollywood Ending,\\" thank goodness, but it's the way you want the book to end.  Because of that, you'll want to read it again.  And again....
B008Y768XO|5.0|For the entire family - everyone liked it. Surprised to know it was based on a true story. Highly recommend!
0143113100|5.0|This work describes in detail the marvelous<br />plasticity of the brain in healing and<br />compensating for residual damages from<br />serious injuries. Doidge describes ways<br />stroke victims learn to move unmovable limbs<br />after making new connecting pathways.<br /><br />Doidge indicates that pain is the dark side<br />of plasticity. Senses have a plastic nature<br />which implies that when one is damaged-another<br />takes over in a process called sensory substitution.<br /><br />A related concept is that the brain can reorganize<br />itself to make substitutions and recover functionality.<br />There are specific modalities like tracing exercises<br />to improve speaking, writing and reading. In addition,<br />the cerebral cortex is a center which learns how to<br />learn. The author explains that brain topology is<br />ordered.<br /><br />The book explains that the loss of part of the body<br />triggers the surviving brain map into seeking<br />stimulation such that nerve growth factors are released<br />inviting neutrons from nearby maps to send new sprouts<br />to take hold. In addition, Doidge explains how the<br />neuronal stem cells play a key role in rejuvenating the<br />brain.<br /><br />The author documents the existence of the Taub Therapy<br />Clinic for stroke victims. In this clinic, patients do<br />things like stretching variable sized rubber bands to<br />simulate renewed plasticity in the fingers of stroke<br />victims. In closing, \\"The Brain That Changes Itself\\"<br />is an important contribution to brain science. The<br />author describes some cutting-edge research like<br />\\"Basic Problems of Neurolinguistics\\" by Luria to<br />provide foundations for further discussion.
1401233376|4.0|is a good comic but ther could be  better if  a format more bigger like a absolute edition and beter size
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|So far this is the only app I've found that can edit large rtf files. When I first bought it, that was only just barely true. Since then, the interface has improved and more formatting features are  available. Saveng large files is still very slow, but the program is very stable so I'm losing my urgeto save often.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the tablet version is nice. worthgetting but ultimately you should get he computer version. it has a lot lore stuff and regular updates
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thank you, a  lifesaver for our kindle. Daughter now happy that her kindle can be charged fully now. Good job!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I picked this up for free here after buying &#34;Cut the Rope:Experiments&#34; before. But it's a very fun puzzle game with simple mechanics, but really fun and challenging puzzles. They aren't frustrating by any means. But they will definitely get you to have to try four or five times on some of the harder ones. I absolutely recommend for ages 5/7+
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Great for kindle fire documents that you want to underline / highlight. It's also free- so there's nothing better than that.
1401907725|5.0|This has really become one of my favorite sets. There are days where I just wake up in a fog and unsure of so many things. And although I'm keen on prayer it just doesn't always make me feel better right away. Being able to grab this set and have guidance from my Angels is a great way of at least knowing where to start and what direction I should head in. I Love this set and highly recommend it to anyone who's curious to the realm of Oracle cards and would like to see how it all works. Love and Light, Maria
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|What's not to like.  Saw this one at the theater.  Awesome!! One of the best Star Trek movies yet.  Must have for the serious Trekie.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|This one started off in a strange way....sort of The Adventures of Tom the Torturer...and I really wondered if I would end up pitching it.  But as it went on, you realize there are layers to the world  and strange things beneath the surface.  And you get interested in some of the characters, who have complex levels of emotion that sets this book off from other fantasies. I'm hooked now, and want to know more, so now it's on to the next volume.
B00005JL1C|5.0|Love this movie. One of my favorites!!!! takes me back to good old movies. thank you so much its wonderful
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS SO AWSOME!!!!  I'M A MINECRAFT LOVER!!!!  IT IS SO AWSOME WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!!!!!  I VOTE 5STARS FOR THIS REVIEW CUZ IT IS SOOOOO AWSOMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns and really enjoyed them.  I couldn't wait to read this one.  He weaves together the lives of the characters in this book and switches back and forth to past and present time periods.  For me it was a little difficult to follow due to the short periods of time that I have to read.  This is a gifted writer!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wonderful game that is additive. I use this gave to increase coordination and quick thinking skills for my students and they enjoy it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I almost never award five stars to anything, but this is one that deserves it. Terrific plot, characters, imagination. Bravo!
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I think one of the things that has been lacking in some films is a masculine exploration of the depths a man can reach emotionally. This movie demonstrates the emotional heart of a man that has gone from confused, to hurt, to burying it, to eventually... well, no spoilers.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|This is such a well done funny movie. It arrived in great condition and works well. I recommend it for yourself or as a gift.
B0039NEINA|5.0|Accurate portrayal of the impact of PTSD on our returning veterans and their families. Violence is not portrayed directly, but this film will give you second thoughts about war.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for Android is quite simply the  best book store and reading app available.  Is there a tablet owner alive who hasn't installed this priceless app?  Smooth as butter!!!!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|It draws you in to another world, most people would never see or expierence. You see a gritty harder side of a whole subculture
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is pure genius!  The sound and graphics are astounding as you all know and it is endlessly entertaining.  Feeding this frog will keep you coming back for months and months.  Get it!
6305949980|5.0|a movie you can watch for both Christmas and Halloween.  funny wonderful seasonal movie.  some features.  this movie if i am not mistaken is made from clay full of action.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Another wonderful addition to your tablet.  The voice recognition on this app is near perfect.  Ask for the definition of any word and it promptly displays it for you.  No typing and entering, just speak to it.  Wonderful!
B00BWWS81S|5.0|This album in my opinion is really great.  I am really pleased that Amazon has the autorip feature so that you can get high quality recording off of the CD, but also have the album to listen to instantly, very smart marketing decision in my opinion.<br /><br />KT Tunstall has some really beautiful lyrics and I really fell in love with the accessibility of the album, she has understandable lyrics with deep meaning so there is the immediate satisfaction of &#34;oh this is good&#34; and then the pleasure of on the second and third listen still discovering new things.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love the game best ever is amazing graphics are awesome.  really should buy it is fun horses look so real.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Works well, you can see the ship and it adds some cool spice to the beaten to death space invaders game type
B00ELD19OI|5.0|A great addition to Visions. A mature album then previous ones. Did not disappoint even with high expectations.<br />&#34;Falling Back to Earth&#34; is one of the most epic and rich tracks I've ever laid ears on.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|It is a futuristic movie that balances with sci-fii and reality.  Recommend to all audiences and would watch again tomorrow
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Listening to this I sometimes forgot it was Vince and not Buck Owens singing.  A real tribute to Vince and the outstanding steel guitar playing.  A keeper!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book makes you laugh, cry, and think deeply.  Touching story, wonderful characters. I didn't want to put it down, and didn't want it to end.
1582701709|5.0|This book if phenomenal.  Constantly wondering about life, I would have truly never known that the secret to living a great life is to have aenough positive mind andand do good or what you believe is good.  This is unbelievebly ground breaking and could result in world peace if another of this level is written.  I seriously may write a book, likely title it something very arcane and kick some real knowledge and who knows...maybe save the universe
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This app makes it easy to locate files and downloaded content. I recommend it for everyone to use. Solid application
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It works perfectly for kindle fire and I love it so much you should really get it for your kids
0316743003|5.0|This was a gift.  I first got the book as a gift.  No one has ever not liked it.  I don't recall anyone not raving about it.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Let's face it, Dexter ended in Season 7. That was it. Ten-four, over and out...<br /><br />Season 8 is just an \\"expansion pack\\" or cheesey \\"add-on\\" of a season. It really has no relevance to anything that was going on in the series, whatsoever. It reminds me of a really, really BAD sequel to a great movie that bears no resemblance to the original.<br /><br />Here's the rundown of every episode in season 8:<br /><br />First, they talk about stuff at Dexter's house.<br />Then, they talk about stuff at the beach.<br />Later that day, they talk about even more stuff at the police station.<br />Ancillary character dies...<br />Then they talk about stuff at a Cuban restaurant.<br />Que useless excuse of a plot twist that nobody cares about to add suspense that just isn't there anymore.<br /><br />Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />Season 8 really is just a typical boring soap opera. Nothing happens. Nobody really does anything. They just sit or stand around talking about \\"stuff & things\\" the entire time. No \\"edge of your seat\\" suspense. No clever plot twists. Nadda. The cast just hangs out and talks about newly introduced prop characters and relationships of third string characters who are so useless, most people still can't remember their names after 8 seasons.<br /><br />And yes, I'm writing this just before the last episode airs. The fact is though, I don't care anymore. I really didn't care if Gilbert's wedding went off without a hitch in \\"Revenge of the Nerds part 2: Nerds in Love\\". I didn't really care how Jason Bateman's dating status would be at the end of \\"Teen Wolf Too\\" either. And I really don't care where the pawned off, watered down and excruciatingly boring version of Dexter will be at the end of this \\"bonus season\\".<br /><br />Season 8 introduces so many wooden, disposable characters like Dr. Vogul, Zack and \\"that brain surgeon guy\\" and so many ridiculous, out of character plot twists (Deb's a crack head wait, no she's not... Argentina? Seriously?) that it's not even fit for -- NBC. Yea, it's that bad...<br /><br />Season 8 could not have been any worse if it were done entirely with sock puppets. At least then, it may have been mildly entertaining; if only for a few minutes.<br /><br />Season 8 really is one of the biggest let downs in television history. I never though a 5 star show like Dexter would end like this. A serial killer who ends the story by boring everyone to death.even fit for -- NBC. Yea, it's that bad...<br /><br />Season 8 could not have been any worse if it were done entirely with sock puppets.

B005LAIIHG|3.0|I was disappointed.  It did not keep my interest.  Was expecting more from an Ang Lee film.  Should watch it again but can't get the motivation to do it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The book is romantic, sexy, crazy like the tea cups at Disney land sometimes. I loved it!!! Keep them coming!
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Good Fellas, Casino, A Bronx Tale, Meet The Parents, and Heat.<br /><br />Your complete Robert DeNiro collection and all you'll ever need.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fabulous and intense. I couldn't put it down. It's a story of intrigue, sex, love, despair, fear and control. I couldn't get enough of Christian
1416955070|5.0|This is one of my favorite book (and series) that i highly recommend to anyone who loves to read and adventure with the supernatural world.
0307474259|5.0|Gary Taubes convincingly describes why it isn't eating too much that makes us fat - it's eating foods which make us fat (i.e. refined carbs & sugar) that make us fat.  This book changed my eating habits,  and I lost 10 pounds, and cut my triglycerides in half.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I LOVE it! It's one of my favorite tv series that i could watch constantly without getting tired of it.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|I think I got this app as a free app of the day. The game is fun to play, when you have a bit of time to pass. I don't think I would pay for the app.
B0060MYM3S|3.0|Haven't started it yet. Im sure its really good but i have other series that i love more. Can't wait though!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|It is easy to get lost in playing this game. Each time I began to play with the intent to play for a few minutes, I stop after about an hour. Great for long trips but not before bed. :-)
B008CLI4N4|3.0|It's alright, but i'm not a fan of the series like my sister and friends are. But if you like HBO series than yes i suggest to look into it.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|After reading so much about this knife, I picked up one. Fortunately or fortunately, my days of roughing it in the woods, deserts, and fields are hopefully in my past, but I wanted a solid knife that I'd be using for utility, put on my gear and the one I should have had back in the Marines.<br /><br />This is a stout, well made, well thought out knife. It's just about perfect for many of the usual bushcraft tasks, but I also noted, as did a friend with some experience, it's precisely the right length, heft and form for not turning on you in various wrist angle thrusts when you're doing some of the really critical knife work that Ray Maers and Les Stroud would never think of, but Marines and combat Army MOS Army definitely would consider.<br /><br />I work leather so making a sheath I'd like wouldn't be a problem, but I've no complaints with the scabbard it came with after I did a few of the usual mods.
1402270275|5.0|Can't wait to read this book and the second one! Read the summary and it sounds really good. Can't wait!
B005DJREGQ|1.0|Tasteless show that pushes the envelope beyond appropriateness! Didn't even find the humor beyond the lack of morals in your face.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|My other game addiction. It has slowed me down on playing candy crush. Really like this game. Try it for yourself
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|This film was epically disappointing. It's set at a military academy right before humans encounter the covenant and follows a squad of cadets as they go through training. It starts out in a documentary style with interviews from each of the cadets, and then proceeds to spend the first half of the movie doing character development. Unfortunately this mostly consists of us watching them watch newsreels, video letters, etc, and talk about what a recalcitrant moron the protagonist is; there's very little action in either the physical or dramatic sense. Scrolling text on screen with character bios would have been better; at least I would have had something to read. If you want to see this done right go watch Full Metal Jacket.<br /><br />Fortunately the action picks up in the second half when things suddenly go off the rails, and we get to see some actual battles and the characters we've come to know painfully well put into some stressful situations. The costume design and special effects are actually pretty decent here, but the cinematography is awful. It leans really heavily on slow motion, which when used sparingly can really enhance action scenes, but when literally every significant action that happens on screen takes 20 times longer than it should you start checking your phone for new emails. It also gives you a lot of time to see all the stupid mistakes they made, e.g. the gatling gun on the warthog not rotating as it fires.<br /><br />Overall it's a complete mess. The set design, script, cinematography, and plot are all terrible, the acting varies from mediocre to abysmal, and the action would be decent if it weren't so painfully slow. It's only saving grace is it's costume design and special effects. The real dealbreaker though is between the first half where nothing happens and the second half where everything happens in slow motion the movie ends up being downright boring, which is a real shame given its source material. Speaking as someone who played throughthe first three games and read several of the books - all of which I thoroughly enjoyed - I'd highly recommend not wasting your time with this.
0064430227|5.0|When I read it to my three year old grandson for the first time he was spellbound, hanging on every word. Then he took it home and insisted on sleeping with it. It is now his new favorite book.
B00911UQAS|5.0|this kit is (as other reviewers have put it) one for the pros. you're going to want at least a few high-grade or real-grade gundam kits under your belt before attempting to build this model. assembly requires patience, but it does not require a degree in engineering. pay close attention to instructions and you'll do fine. i've only found a select few pieces i needed to glue down, but aside from then the whole thing comes together beautifully. as for paint; it's not required, but if you're talented, go for it.<br /><br />my package shipped from japan to the USA in a few days, and in about 3 weeks i received it. i was charged no tariffs (due to the product being a model), and it cleared customs like a breeze, arriving a full 11 days earlier than the estimated time.<br /><br />if you liked metal gear solid, (and you especially liked driving REX in MGS4) you'll love this kit. (i planned on getting it 18 months ago!)
B002RHL8DC|5.0|I liked SGU and just when it was getting good into season 2 the Syfy channel canceled it to make room for Wrestling and 10 varieties of Ghost hunters garbage. I haven't watched Syfy since and I do not intend too. I'm also not going to buy this, I'll wait to buy it second hand to make sure Syfy doesn't make a dime from me. I wish someone would create a good Science fiction channel for us fans
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Her performance at the Royal Albert Hall tops any other performances in my view.  She has accomplished her dream of performing there in her lifetime.  The recording is superb capturing moments from the audiences and on stage.  That's all I can say about this.<br />Adele will be with us along time, and hope to see her performance more and more.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|I'm not going to rate the movie other than to say I found it to be better than expected.<br />My issue is that the color on the 3D disc was absolutely awful; washed out and very yellow flesh tones. I had to give up on the 3D disc about a quarter of the way through the movie and switch to the 2D Blu-ray disc... much better.<br />I returned the whole set, for a replacement, but it was no different from the first.<br />I'll give the movie 4 stars, but the 3D disc, only because of the color issues, 1 star.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|A very clever story of a murder and how the very wise Anthony Hopkins attempting to plan how to get rid of his wife.  If you like the perfect crime and you like the Lecter role.  You will like this.<br /><br />Forrest
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Every song on album is great. So happy to have purchased this album<br />I can relive their concert every day
B00005JLKN|5.0|You need to see Anthony Hopkins again behind his plastic jail scene.  Watching it again after several years ago and I think this is one of the best H. Lecter series.<br /><br />Forrest
0062238868|5.0|Chris Kyle's humble & honest portrayal of his military service, while including the reality of the affects it had on his personal life is eye opening and just makes you appreciate our silent warriors even more after you read his book.  Also, anyway I can support him and his family now that he is gone is least that I can do to thank him and his family for their sacrifice.  Remember to support the family against the egomanic Jesse Ventura and his attorneys for Chris being honest about dropping Mr. Ventura on his a** for running his mouth while others were mourning a lost comrade in arms.
B00BVMXBDO|4.0|I like the new faces in this story but it often jumped from on part to another that often had little connection between parts of the story.  I got lost often.<br /><br />Forrest
B005K17RU0|5.0|I get instant weather for my city, plus two or three other cities that I follow...and as a whole it is a very accurate forecast.  Works well on my Kindle Fire HD.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|If you liked Gone Girl, I believe you will enjoy this book. Once the letter is read the book moves fast (ay be a little too fast) and I would have referred a different ending. Definitely read the epilogue...very interesting!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like it very much. Simple card game but its lots of fun if you like any type of card games

B001NLL93W|5.0|This is a great series to read!! I was hooked on Jace and Clary with the first book!! I'm not a big fan of vampire/werewolf type stories but these have me captivated. All the books are well written and very descriptive. I have a hard time putting them down as I'm continually anticipating what comes next!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very interesting all the way through!  Author did a great job of peaking my interest with some interesting twists and turns.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the horses in this game! Not much costs money,so this is wonderful! I have never played a better game on the kindle!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works so well, it's beyond amazing! I was actually surprised at the high quality of the video, it's such a tiny thing. It will be even better when more apps support it, but I was delighted when I found out that even my first-generation Kindle Fire can send Netflix videos to it! Also pleased that it's compatible with my 4th gen iPod Touch. It's definitely a ground-breaking gadget!
B0009UC810|5.0|This is a classic movie.  One you can watch over and over again.  Jake and  Elwood Blues.  The epitome of cool.  If you have never seen it,  you need too.  And you will again - and again.  It will become a favorite.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book and interested that a movie is being made based on it.  As a St Louis native, it was interesting to read all of the Missouri/St Louis references.

Am interested in other works by this same author

B008AK8FHM|2.0|Although I have no doubt Dr. Alexander experienced an NDE as he described, in the end this book left me feeling unhappy and heavy, unusual for me after reading about Near Death Experiences (NDE's). Other books I've read about experiencing heaven while nearly dead described heaven as a beautiful place where the &#34;dead&#34; person wanted to stay forever, described Christ Jesus as being tender and loving with beautiful penetrating eyes, described God as a glorious Being, brilliant with light and and sitting on His throne surrounded by rainbows of colors.This is similar to what we read in the Bible. Other books of this type, and I've read quite a few, actually left me looking forward to heaven! However, Dr. Alexander's experience seemed to encompass ALL of the afterlife, not heaven alone. He was given an overview of what exists for the people of the earth to face eternally. From a murky, dark and suffocating underground sort of place with heavy, pounding, deafening sounds and grotesque faces which groaned and screeched, a place which he entered first and returned to last before &#34;returning to awareness&#34;, he was led to a beautiful  place he called a &#34;gateway&#34; (to heaven?).  It was green and lush with trees, fields, streams and waterfalls and happy laughing people and music. He flew over it with a girl on the wing of a butterfly and under clouds where shimmering beings arced across the sky. Above &#34;a sound, huge and booming like a glorious chant&#34; was heard and he wondered if the joyful winged creatures were making it. (This lines up with Revelation, chapter 19 where we're told that those who dwell in heaven will shout praises to God forever and ever like a roar of rushing waters). From there he moved into &#34;an immense void,... an inky darkness that was also brimming with light&#34; which he sensed &#34;was God, the Creator, the Source Who is responsible for making the universe and all in it.&#34; (Although I have not found God in scripture described as darkness, the rest of his description does line up with scripture). I believe that God showed him two important things: that there IS an afterlife, and that there are different places in the afterlife where we can end up spending eternity: the horrible, suffocating Hades (whose occupants later will join the devil in the lake of burning fire, or hell)  and the gloriously brilliant and beautiful heaven, brimming with light, music, praise and joy. (How we live according to God's specific instructions in the Bible will ultimately determine our place of destination, but the author never appeared to glean that from his experience. Although Dr. Alexander obviously is a brilliant neurosurgeon and scientist, in this book he never mentioned the Bible or sought to read it in later months, nor did he attempt to discover the many things which God has already taught us in His Word regarding how to live our years on earth or about our eternal destiny. That is why I felt the book was so sad).<br />Dr. Alexander used a dramatic and traumatic NDE to prove to the scientific world, specifically other doctors, that there is an afterlife. He does that well. He alternates later chapters in the book between his personal coma experience and scientific back-up  for why he could not have dreamed his experience. It becomes quite technical with details about phiosiology, cells and fluids and the functioning of the brain. In my views, he could have been using his time better to read and study God's Word  FIRST, then to write a book that INCLUDED showing others that there is indeed an afterlife, and that if we believe what God has been telling mankind for over 4,000 years and we obey Him, we will live eternally in heaven with Him. Why would anyone want to experience the horrors of hell?!<br />Dr. Alexander seems to assume that he will go to heaven when he dies since he has been shown a glimpse of it. He does not address the fact that he also has been shown the underworld of Hades. In God's Word, Jesus clearly says, &#34;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&#34; (John 14:6). Yet there was no mention of seeing Jesus or of seeking to know about Him later. Eben Alexander has the audacity to say, after travelling into a blackness outlined with a bright light (which he says was God), that when he awoke, he not only believed in God, but he knew God. I disagree! I say that, possibly, he EXPERIENCED God. Certainly, nobody KNOWS God unless they study His character in the Love Letter He wrote to every person who has ever lived. And still, we can't KNOW God until we learn to commune with Him in prayer, coming to Him in the name of Jesus.<br />In my view, Dr. Alexander missed the main point of his NDE because he missed the opportunity God gave him to learn of Himself in later Bible study and to tell others how to have eternal life in heaven as a result of this study following his personal NDE. In Jeremiah 29:11-14 God says,<br />' &#34;For I know the plans I have for you,&#34; declares the Lord, &#34;plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you,&#34; declares the Lord.'  Did Dr. Alexander miss God's plan to prosper him and give him hope of heaven and a future in eternity there with Him because he failed to seek Him with all of his heart after his NDE? I believe that he did.<br />Although this book missed the point that God appeared to be making to Eben Alexander when he was chosen to experience a nearness to death, it is well written, descriptive, and informative.'s Word, Jesus clearly says, &#34;I am the way and the truth and the life.

B00CH26TL8|1.0|I am taking the time to write this review, because I feel it is necessary. I already have bubble Witch Saga, candy crush saga, and even the Pets Saga. I got all of these apps from the Google Play Store, and they worked correctly. I have an Asus Transformer Prime quad core tablet, and I have a Toshiba 10 inch tablet, also with a quad core processor. both of my super tablets are capable of running any app that is currently developed.the problem that I have yes, why does my quad core tablet report that bubble Witch Saga from the Amazon store is not compatible. It is ridiculous my tegra processors would literally run circles around any kindle tablet. I install the Amazon app store on both of my quad core tablet, because I wanted the function ability of the Amazon app store. Well I'm seriously going to delete it now, I have noticed that the apps are completely different versions on Amazon and they are on Google. I believe the Amazon store is rigged. If an app is compatible on the Google Play Store, for once device, it should be available on the other app store. I feel that Amazon is trying to corner the market, by deceptive dirty practices. And I do not feel that the free app of the day is worth keeping the Amazon app store if they are going to have second rate chopped versions of apps that you could get from the Google Play Store.I also feel that Amazon will probably not even let me publish this unless I say something about the game. So here goes it runs very well on both of my quad core tablet unfortunately I had to download it from another app store so they will not be receiving any of the in app purchases that I purchased frequently. I bet you feel stupid now. You know how many people on a galaxy s4, you know how many people on tablets with Tegra processors. I guess you won't be receiving any of that money and now you know why the Google Play Store is the number one. The Amazon app store is just second rate..... one last funny thing to mention. My quad core tablet sodefinitely compatible with grand theft auto vice city. Yet bubble Witch Saga is not. Really?

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|First, it gets +1 star for coolness. Put what's on your phone onto the TV, wirelessly, after just a few minutes of setup, for only 35 dollars. Yes, that's cool.<br /><br />What it does, it does well.<br /><br />What it doesn't do is why I returned it.<br /><br />It doesn't do anything, except for coolness.<br /><br />And except for Netflix and YouTube, both of which are available in better resolution via the computer that's plugged into my TV. Netflix and YouTube are the only things from my iPhone that I can display via Chromecast on my TV. I was going to rig the iPad to display via Chromecast, too, but that will work no better than the iPhone according to the Chromecast online help.<br /><br />I had expected to display a much wider range of things, like a PowerPoint presentation, or http://LeMonde.fr, or my FaceTime conversation with my girlfriend.<br /><br />Maybe I'll try the AppleTV/Airplay ($$!) option. My neighbor's teenage kid had rigged that up at their house, playing recorded music on the TV while the screen gave a slideshow of various photos. That was cool, of course. See first paragraph. My old Windows XP computer, with Winamp and Picasa Screensaver, has spent most of every day doing the same thing since 2010 on the attached monitor and stereo speakers. It can wirefully do the same thing as the AirTV/AirPlay demo, if I plug the computer into the TV.<br /><br />Maybe in two or three years the technology will have expanded my choices, or leapfrogged the issue entirely, and I'll look into it again.

0753827662|5.0|Fiendishly clever and constantly surprising, this novel is the blackest comedy about marriage imaginable (actually it's unimaginable).  As it winds toward its close, the satire becomes more and more obvious and acid-tinged, and while the comedy certainly makes you cringe rather than laugh, anyone who doesn't catch a distorted disconcerting carnival funhouse glimpse of him or herself and spouse is fooling themselves. GONE GIRL breaks every contract that usually exists between author and reader and does so with panache; it's as manipulative as either of its main characters, and the reading experience may just help explain what it is that Nick and Amy see in one another.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|In a time where high tech effects, loud piercing sounds, robotic actors, violence, foul language, and sex is involved in a movie or tv show (series), Downton Abbey continues to be successful without any of the above. The scenery, clothing, and history of the period is beautifully seen and heard through the wonderfully detailed writing and superb acting. Season Three continues to excite and keep the anxious feeling of &#34;what will happen next&#34;. I thought the &#34;Christmas Season&#34; from Season 2 was spectacular until both Mary and Matthew's wedding (in Season 3), and the last episode where there is elation from the birth of their son to the loving scenes of seeing Mary and Matthew as loving, glowing parents. The bombshell, without any glorified special effects, was seeing Matthew joyfully drive to tell all the relatives the wonderful news, then dying in the car accident. I can't wait to see what happens in Season 4.

B00B4VXQC8|1.0|Bon Jovi abandoned their original fans when they released Crush. Since the release of Crush Bon Jovi has continued to release un-Bon Jovi like material. Their first six albums compared to their last six albums sounds like two completely different bands. Even their live sets contain less and less of the great stuff from their glory days. I just watched a tribute band by the name Blaze of Glory and they sound more like Bon Jovi than Bon Jovi does today. Classic fans should avoid buying this recording. It is a major disappointment from start to finish. Put the older ones on and remember the good old days. This one blows!!!!!

B00DJYJPLO|5.0|The Before films never previously dealt with relationships.  Or at least they never dealt with the day in, day out labor of maintaining a relationship over the course of years.  Before Sunrise lovingly details the opening stages of romance, and Before Sunset reignites this relationship while including the added pressures of growing older.  Before Midnight, then, is the first of this series to actually investigate how Jessie and Celine might function as a married couple entering into middle age together.<br /><br />As its impossibly gorgeous European locale, Before Midnight takes Greece.  Jessie has been invited to a kind of summer writers program at the home of a Grecian author.  Jessie's son from his first marriage, Hank, has spent his summer in Greece with Jessie and Celine.  The film's opening sees Jessie sending Hank back home, and it captures the nice dynamic between an inarticulate early teen and his loquacious father.  Jessie keeps on trying to engage his son in conversation, but Hank doesn't bite, and you start to think that maybe the relationship between the two is strained.  But before passing through security, Hank blurts out that this has been the best summer of his life.  Jessie returns to Celine and their twin blonde headed moppets who are waiting outside the airport, but it is clear that the geographical divide between he and his son weighs on Jessie, a problem that has subtly torn at Celine and Jessie's relationship.<br /><br />Like the two prior films, Before Midnight could easily have been produced as a stage play.  The film can be divided into at least four distinct parts: the drive home from the airport, the Grecian dinner party, the walk to the hotel, and the confrontation at the hotel.  In each section, the camera maintains long shots that hold for what I would imagine are at least ten minutes at a time.  The drive home appears to be nearly one long shot.  But Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have developed such charisma and so easily inhabit thesecharacters that their back and forth creates a kind of suspense.  We wish to know what each character will say next.<br /><br />The movie's fulcrum is a playful dinner scene where several generations of diners discuss the possibilities and permutations of relationships.  A twenty-something couple who are clearly infatuated with each other at the same time deny that monogamy is even possible.  A couple, around the same age as Jessie and Celine, clearly takes a cynical view of their relationship and never really take it seriously.  The elderly host, meanwhile, speaks to the necessity of always being two in a relationship, of never fully melding your identity with that of your husband or wife.  In one story that's bandied about, a guest recounts a lengthy autobiography/letter left behind by her grandmother where her husband only takes up a grand total of a few pages.  For this woman, her female friends were the relationships she truly cherished.<br /><br />The entire film culminates with a confrontation in a hotel room.  As a present, Jessie and Celine were given a hotel room for the night so that they could get away from their two daughters and have a romantic evening.  This eventually results in a truly epic fight.  But on their walk to the hotel, the two engage in the kinds of conversations that we have come to expect from these two.  At the same time it is clear that after nine years, these little tete-a-tete's have become increasingly rare.  After reaching the hotel, their romantic evening is stymied by an argument that begins with an off handed comment Jessie made earlier about wanting to move back to the States in order to be closer to his son, a comment which resulted in a number of subtle and not so subtle jabs by Celine over the course of the day.  But soon the argument veers off in a number of directions, building on nine years of issues left unresolved.<br /><br />Perhaps the closest cinematic equivalent to the blow up between Celine and Jessie is the Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor drama Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?  But despite the level of anger and the deep wounds Celine and Jessie inflict on one another over the course of this argument, it never quite veers into the bleak cynicism of Wolf.  Burton and Taylor's characters love seemed to manifest only when they were tearing at one another.  It knew no other form.  We know that Celine and Jessie are capable of transcending all of the every day difficulties of life.  Hawke, Delpy, and Linklater also manage to stage the fight in such a way that it veers from raw to humorous.  A combatant might spew an argument ending decree only to come back with an \\"And another thing...\\"  The filmmakers are also careful to take the complaints of disappointments and unmet needs seriously.  Neither character is fully right nor wrong.  When Celine engages in a typical feminist argument that she is burdened with the childcare, we might not fully agree with the degree of her claims.  But at the same time it's clear that Jessie is attempting to position her as the irrational female.  No doubt, there is some truth in Celine's critique that sexism affects their relationship.<br /><br />Before entering the hotel, Jessie and Celine sit by the Mediterranean watching the sunset.  Jessie narrates the sun's disappearance over some seaside cliffs: \\"Still there. Still there. Still there. It's gone.\\"  The fight in the hotel room is at times so mean spirited, so vicious that it could easily be the end.  Their relationship might one day be there and the next gone.  And like the previous two films, things end somewhat ambiguously.  We are not given full closure on the story of Jessie and Celine, because as an audience, we must leave before their narrative is truly over.  But call me an optimist, because I think these two will stay together long into old age.  Despite it all, they are just too interesting together to break up.<br /><br />It's hard to overstate what the trio of Hawke, Delpy, and Linklater have accomplished with the Before Trilogy.  Each successive movie only deepens these characters.  And the themes have become more nuanced, more multifaceted with time.  If Before Midnight isn't the most enjoyable of the three movies (and that's not to say it is ever dull), it is perhaps the best of the trilogy.  My guess is that Midnight marks the end of this series, but without a doubt the relationship between Jessie and Celine lives on in the minds of their fans.  The characters seem to live outside of the screen.

B004I744AS|4.0|I have used a variety of apps like this one but this seems to be easier to use and the layout is great. Definitely one to add to hour collection.
B001AACEP8|5.0|I love Katy, I have other albums of hers and they are great, a couple songs here and there that I don't care for but nothing hindering me from listening to the songs over and over.
0738711500|5.0|To be honest, I was only interested in these cards because I played video games where they kept using tarot cards as their gimmick (mostly Persona 3); however, as I read the book and tried the cards out for myself I was interested in how these cards represented how people may feel or behave and what they may experience.<br /><br />I'm not very knowledgeable about how people view tarot cards, but I've noticed that there are mixed feelings up and about where some people may see them as some sort of game whereas others may see them as a &#34;satanic art,&#34; and I use this term in no offensive or biased manner whatsoever. There are certainly cards such as &#34;the Devil&#34; and &#34;Death&#34; card that seem intimidating. This doesn't necessarily mean that if someone gets an ominous card that incredibly bad things will happen to them or that they'll die. It merely gives them something to think about. That's the fun that comes from using these cards: being able to think about how much you can relate to the events and feelings that these cards describe.
B00136JT3Y|5.0|I love Pink, I have other albums of hers and they are great, a couple songs here and there that I don't care for but nothing hindering me from listening to the songs over and over.
B00479SVBU|4.0|This is my second purchase of this player (bought one for my son).  It works great, just like most reviewers have said. Only issues are small: sometimes I get interference from fm radio stations. There is no perfect frequency to select but if one has lots of trouble I just change to another; sound is a little low compared to cd. radio, etc. even with unit volume up to highest; the remote seems superfluous.<br />Overall the Soundfly has better sound quality than either fm or XM radio in my cars and works with all media. I like it very much and use it in three cars and two motorcycles with a 32 gb flash drive mostly. Had one for 9 months and this one three.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|simple challenge for an a adult but a good logic puzzle for kids.  can't wait for more levels! should be good.
0156034026|5.0|This is the book that made me a Hamid fan.  Hamid's first person narrative is engrossing and the approach, a conversation in a Lahore cafe, is unique. I could barely put the book down; the insight and depth of characters leaves one torn between wanting to counsel them and wondering about how life's path can be altered via small and often insignificant encounters, conversations, and reflection.  I was left wondering what happened to the characters... a true sign of becoming highly involved in a novel.
1423141997|5.0|My son devoured this book.  He just couldn't put it down.  Any book that draws him away from electronic games is a winner to me!
0142501123|5.0|We love all books by Julia Donaldson- seriously we have not read any we didn't like.  Our favorite is the Gruffalo series, with the Tabby McCat a close second!
B0060V1WJ6|2.0|I felt a better title would have been \\"Crazy & Stupid\\". Although a bit humorous at times, didn't make up for the yawner of a script.  Couldn't make it through, and gave up about half way....fell asleep! (age 65+ may be the problem)
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|It crashed my kindle...I had to restart it. It didnt even go off at the time that i set the alarm.
B005LAII4E|2.0|I bought this not expecting much but I love the fight scenes. The acting was horrible. I feel asleep! that is how bad this movie is.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good read, Ana is finally going to smarten up.  Maybe so will Mr. Christopher Grey.<br /><br />  The potential is there, hopefully.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|The information is very informative. I felt like I was reading a textbook. I read it for my book club and due to the length, very few of use had been able to finish.  Should have been two separate books.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|The series moves pretty slow, and this book (I would think) kinda rounds out the major set-up.  I'm enjoying the series so far
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I was pretty excited to see a big budget zombie movie, but was totally disappointed by this movie.  If you happen to like very shallow movies then you might like this.  If you want a nice in-depth zombie movie then you will want to skip this one.  I found myself getting bored with it but forced my way through to the end.  Was I glad I watched to the end?  No way...what a waste of time.<br /><br />When it was over I was thinking &#34;Meh....glad I didn't buy it.&#34;  This movie was basically a cash grab capitalizing on the zombie genre.
B002AF4Y96|5.0|very happy to have gotten the actual directors cut. some directors cut editions are missing scenes from the prison riot
B009G41CG2|4.0|I like this one because you  have a lot of different shapes to choose from instead of the basic one.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I have enjoyed fantasy books in the past, and Graceling seemed to have a compelling plot, so I picked it up. It was great. Katsa and Po are great characters, and the concept of people being \\"graced\\" continued to be intriguing. My only real complaint was that it wasn't long enough. Some of the plot twists were rather abrupt, and just about every part of the story could have been fleshed out a little more. I wish it would have been longer, because I didn't want it to end!
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I love James Franco in a &#34;I want to be friends with him&#34; kind of way, but he was totally wrong for this movie. I didn't have high expectations for this movie, having heard all the terrible reviews before we watched it, so I wasn't expecting much. Like every other child of America, I grew up loving the Wizard of Oz. I'm not sure if the people who made this movie thought they wanted to change the dynamic of cinema forever like the original did, but I'm hoping they at least made it with good intentions. Whatever the case, they didn't quite hit the mark. It almost felt like they made a mockery of Oz, going beyond the dream world to a world of ridiculousness. I think kids will like this movie but as an adult who initially (before I heard the reviews after it came out) wanted to be able to experience the awesomeness that Wizard of Oz made me feel as a kid, instead I shook my head and sighed with disappointment.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|It is so welll written and keeps you guessing to the end. It is an emotional roller coaster, portrayed so well, the actual characters are so real. We all know people like them. I had eight hours to fill in at Barcelona airport, I was so pleased I had this book on Kindle. I couldn't put it down.
B00DURGZHW|4.0|Let's preface this with a I'm not a film watcher who follows directors or producers and can name every film or project those types have done. I'm your average married 9-5er, recently graduated from happy hours and fun, to laying on the couch and watching movies so I don't feel like crap the next morning.  I really enjoyed this one, not because it had notable leading actors but because I thought the kids did a great job. This movie is as slow as the grand ole Mississippi on which it is based, up til the end, as the pace picks up and there's finally a little excitement. Call me crazy in my ripe old age of 32, but the PG13 rating seemed off, not because it's too violent or there's too many swears, but because I think the content of the film will bore any kid. So not a family film, I don't think, but a good film, with good acting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just when you thought that there were no more original stories to tell ... This one comes along.  Lots of great themes about humanity, leadership, and courage.  Kudos to the author.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Wasn't the best, wasn't the worst. Good movie for renting at home when you don't feel like going out. I can't remember but I think they were going for a pg 13? I wouldn't watch it with the kids. I didn't read the book but I've heard it didn't follow anywhere close, so if you did, you're going to be disappointed.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Fantastic album. A nice blend of r&b, funk, and some rap. Electric lady proves that there are still some young artists working to make a unique sound. it's just a shame that so few have big hits.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I always get nervous when I see movies based on previous movies or tv series, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Action packed and true to the story line of Star Trek as far as I can tell (I'm definitely no Trekkie), I thought this was an enjoyable film, and I think the actors they picked for the characters did a great job. It's actually good enough that, on nights where we can't find anything on tv, we've reached for this one once already, and I wouldn't hate to watch it again.
B001BANK32|5.0|Just finished re-reading it before doctor sleep comes out.  Still creepy and scary over 30 years later.  I can understand shy Stephen King did not like the Stanley Kubrick movie version of his book.  They are so different and the book is so much scarier!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I thought this movie was ok, my husband thought it was terrible and predictable, but he is also a self proclaimed movie aficionado and drives me crazy trying to guess where the movie is going. I every movie, out loud, so most of the time he ruins my viewing experience. But I digress. I thought this movie was ok, it was a little weird, a little silly, and used an idea that seems to be a hot topic these days. I'm not a huge tom cruise fan, but I think that's more of a personal thing, and so when I watch his movies I can't help but think &#34;he just thinks he's so awesome&#34; the whole time. I state in my profile that I don't watch movies based on their cinematography so that fact that I'm bringing it up is saying something. This movie looked cool, esthetically. Aside from that, it was pretty predictable and the ending left me with more questions than answers.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Really I can be SO NERDY when it comes to great books!  In my job as a middle school librarian I'm constantly searching for what I think and what the kids will think is the next big novel.  Well, this is it!  Actually, this is a sequel to another great read - The Selection by Kiera Cass.  You don't have to read the first book before this one but you might want to think about it.  The Elite gives enough background info to get the reader to where she or he needs to be to understand how America, the main character, got into this situation.  I love the story and feel like it is kind of a teen/dystopian version of the Bachelor.  One Prince must choose from the selection, a group of girls, to be his Princess.  America is torn between her growing love for the Prince and her long lost love from home.  When her old love shows up as a guard at the palace things get VERY INTERESTING!  You're just going to need to order this book as soon as possible to find out what happens.  I LOVED it!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|As with any series, I recommend you read the books in order.  Because this is how I read, I can't remember where this particular book begins and where the previous one ends. A Song of Fire And Ice is an exceptional story, and I recommend it to anyone who will listen. The only thing that is difficult is it is SO detailed and there are SO many characters, it's easy to get lost and feel like you need some sort of reference guide. (Which you actually have, in the back of the book) I've never been much of a fantasy reader, but my sister is, and this has been her favorite series since the 1990's when she first discovered A Clash of Kings. (The first book) I will warn you tho; this series has yet to be completed, and with the author continuing to write and publish other stories right now, it's easy to start feeling an inappropriate hatred and annoyance for the author, as it seems he knows about and is therefore flaunting the power he has over his readers.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|This show just keeps getting better and better. Can't wait to see what happens next. Alicia needs to loosen up.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|The acting, singing, costumes etc. were all perfectly splendid.  I can watch this over and over again. I loved it each time.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I love it and watched this movie at least a dozen times since its release.  My kid loves it too.  Get the blu ray version.  The difference in detail is mind blowing.
B005I0DLXK|5.0|This is a great cd and I love it.  This is a great cd and I love it.  Yes in the face.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|I did not enjoy one page of the book. I found it disjointed and unpleasant actually.<br />Would not recommend it to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app one of the best apps ever. I play this app a lot.  And it was very fun to play
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It's a really good game to pass the time... it's really fun if you like guessing games =) in my opinion it's awesome
B00E193TM2|5.0|5FDP's fourth album will not disappoint. Definitely stuck to the formula that has add the band a success haven't stopped listening.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|They have been the case for example is a few weeks of a new comment by the year award in this blog
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the best book I ever read, had me laughing and crying.  You will not regret buying this book.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was one of the best books I have EVER read!!!  I can't wait to read her next book and the next...!!!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|What I really love about this game is that it is fun for all ages. I love how the levels get harder. I like to be challenged when having fun. One thing I do not like is that you have to pay to get more coins to get hints. You should be able to have unlimited hins for free.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|Nothing new here--guess what happens next, and you'll be right.Very light quick read.  Was hoping for more, but read it through.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've tried several other apps of this type but have deleted them all - except for this one. There are a multitude of sounds that you can mix and match, raising the volume of one sound while lowering the volume of one or more of the others. A favorite mix of mine is ocean sounds with frogs ribbiting, forest birds singing and quiet rain - not a mix you would ever hear in nature, but it's very relaxing!<br /><br />One other nice feature is that you can raise or lower the volume with a slider right on the screen. The look of the app is very playing as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended! (and no, I have no connection with the developer!)
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very well done.  A neutral account of a Historical figure that has been created into a God.  Whenever we think on the Romans or the Greeks and their mythology, think of this work and how Jesus (God or Man) has been mythologized.<br /><br />Thought provoking and well presented.  Very highly recommended!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Let's get one thing straight right off the bat:  \\"World War Z\\" the movie bears no relation to \\"World War Z\\" the book except the title.  So be it.  \\"World War Z\\" the book is pretty much unfilmable as written.  Great book, especially the audio version but that's another review.  Other reviewers have critiqued the movie saying many parts are not plausible or don't make sense or just plain stupid.  They don't mention the most implausible part which is that there are no such things as zombies.  The movie is a thriller and it stars Brad Pitt.  Thriller rules mean that there needs to be a hero.  Pitt fills that role admirably without super hero heroics.  He is very competent given his backstory but he is also an ordinary guy.  He does a great job in the part.  Let's face it, zombie fans may not dig that it's a PG-13 movie.  Before I saw it I felt the same.  I'm a big zombie fan in the George Romero tradition.  I could not see how you could stay true to the genre in PG-13.  WWZ is remarkably bloodless and there are no prolonged close-ups of flesh getting rendered and eaten.  Regardless it is one edge of the seat movie.  It has a bunch of intense, thrilling and scary set pieces.  Starting in a traffic jam in Philly, moving on an apartment building in Newark, on to a remote base in Korea, then on to Jerusalem, mayhem on an airplane and finally a WHO facility in Wales.  Non stop action with a few breaks with Pitt's movie family to let you catch your breath and to remind you of the stakes that Pitt's character faces.  All in all a fine movie that gives its money's worth.  This review is based on a 3D viewing in a theater with my daughter and watching it on demand.  As with all movies of this type, it loses a little transferring from the big screen and I imagine the same is true for the DVD.  Still, a rousing action movie well worth both the cost to see it and the time spent watching it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Well written, brilliant cast. There is nothing negative to say about this show except that you will get addicted so be prepared for that
B004W2UBYW|3.0|this has not been a fun read and with such a fascinating subject I expected better. this could have been so much better but it's too cut and dried, reads like a magazine article.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|Challenging.  When are new levels coming. I am hooked and want more. Lots of concentration and observation skills.<br />Well done.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I must confess that I read this many years ago - it is even better that I remembered!  I think with the current &#34;addiction&#34; to games online, it is even more relevant.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|I don't really see this as a child's cartoon, but as an adult (knitter) I love it.  Fun, enjoyable & entertaining.
0694003611|5.0|When my daughter was little (less than 6 months) and very colicky, this is the book I would read to her and it would calm her every time. Now she's 2 years old and she still loves the book!!
1475143389|4.0|Has alot of usefully information. It gives u what you need to know cuts out alot of the bs ,much better to buy this book then spend 8 bucks on a muscle mag thats filled with adds and bs.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|A sentimental return to a favorite.<br /><br />(I REALLY FEEL THAT REQUIRING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WORDS DIS cOURAGES 'RE IEWS) I don't mean for this title particularly. This has been bothering me for a while.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The writing was not wonderful. But I liked the story. There was not as much repetition...still very interesting way to end the book....
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this story and found myself laughing throughout.  A cold drink and a rainy afternoon and a fast read, what more could you want.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|Truly excellent special effects, great acting, great writing and directing! Anybody who likes hi energy slap stick movies will like this.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is truly one of the best works of scifi I have read in a long time. Couldn't put it down, somehow got glue on my hands. I am eagerly awaiting his next book so I will keep hitting refresh on the amazon site. Thank you
B0096CDG0O|5.0|So much fun, my friends and family can't stop playing it. One of the best games out there. Bought the no-ad, so worth it!<br />Great game, thank you!!!!!!!
B0035JNTA6|1.0|Typically all Stiller's movies are funny in a cult style.  This one was like pulling teeth. But too I shut it off after 15 minutes.
B0099114WO|5.0|I'm sure there are few in this film's target audience who aren't at least aware of Tommy Lee Jones's exploits as Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, MIB Agent Kay, and other such action-based roles.  So to see him portray a husband living a quiet life in a nice house would certainly be surprising.  One could only wonder how he'd do.       But Mr. Jones does as fine a job as ever as he is forced into marriage counseling by his wife.  Speaking of his wife...Meryl Streep is as brilliant as ever as a woman wanting to bring a spark back into her marriage now that she and her beloved are empty-nesters...you can tell right away when she is trying to convince everyone, including herself, of the value of the new cable subscription that she and her husband got each other for their anniversary.         However, the scene-stealer of the film was Steve Carell.  When I heard that Mr. Carell was playing the marriage counselor/relationship therapist in this film, I had expected a comedic version of the profession...not too different from Robin Williams's performance in [[ASIN:B004SIP7ZS Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)]].  But Mr. Carell delivered yet another of the film's pleasant surprises.  While having the occasional witty line, he played this role very seriously, making me feel comfortable enough to talk to him...in fact, his performance reminded me of a counselor I once saw (that is a compliment.)         What made this film even better was that it won't end quite the way you expect...you will get a satisfying ending, but the journey won't be quite as you expect it.  So, strap in and take the ride.  Enjoy.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I generally avoid musicals but there are some exceptions. This is definitely one of them. Les Miserables is a masterful blend of cinema, music, and literature. Beautifully done.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Wonderful kid movie. As with most Disney movies now a days they have something for all ages not just the kids! And the fact that Disneyland was able to duplicate it into real life for the theme park is amazing!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The challenge of this novel was to skip from character to character while making each of them believable. The author did that beautifully. Each character has a distinctive and authentic voice. Each one contributes a piece to the puzzle of what happened to the world.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Great and very inspiring! A must for every startup. Should solve allot of failed it-projects on any scale. Read it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use, like having access to the history & being able to reopen a prior calculation Free is GOOOOD
B005544TRQ|5.0|A must watch show! Another hit by the USA network. They keep producing these amazing shows and I keep watching! Hats off!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Useful and funny! As a fan of tim's work I got to say you won't be dissapointed! Enjoy at your own risk!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Well it's definitely a tear jerker, but it's a wonderfully written book. The characters are very likeable, and its a very easy read. There's some great quotes and interesting perspectives on life and illness and the marks we leave on this world. I've already recommended it to friends and let my mother steal it on her iPad.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|Saw it in theaters, but it was definitely worth a second watch. Lots of twists and turns, this movie is anything but predictable!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|While I have enjoyed other books by this author more, this is a great story, well told.  It is definitely worth the read.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Great story line.  The book was at times a little confusing because of who was the narrator.  All and all a good book.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Don't be mislead by the ratings for this book.  It was a piece of ridiculous jumble.  Absolute nonsense.  .  .
B003TOMAPC|4.0|At first I was hesitant but my husband urged me to watch it. I loved it! Good story. Funny. Dramatic and sad too. Best I've ever seen of Nicholas Cage. I totally would recommend.
B003VANOFY|2.0|They are fairly comfortable<br />The volume control is conveniently placed, you don't have to \\"hunt\\" for it<br />The mic rotates conveniently away from your face and auto-mutes itself<br /><br />Unfortunately I have so many technical issues with them that I cannot recommend them<br />Since I got them in 2012 I have had several issues:<br />* The biggest issue is that they randomly turn themselves off while I'm wearing them, even when plugged in.  Sometimes the sound comes back but only at about 25% of the regular volume.<br />* They only seem to hold a charge for about an hour<br />* I routinely receive a pop-up telling me the Logitech G930 has encountered a problem.
B005PK1G76|5.0|We bought this for our trip to Disneyland.  Held our maps, drinks, etc.  It's attached to an umbrella stroller, and we don't have to take it apart when we fold it.  It kinda adjusts itself when we fold the stroller.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I watched the movie on my Kindle Fire HD and the picture quality was awesome! I really enjoyed the movie as I am a huge fan of Marvel Comics. The action in the movie was breathtaking, but some of the oneliners were not so good. Overall, great movie and it is definitely a must see if you are a comic book fan.
0671042858|1.0|Similar to other reviewers, I found this book to be incredibly disappointing. I had high hopes that Mr King would once again deliver on a suspense-filled thriller, like so many other of his titles I've enjoyed. Not so, this time around. Very, very slow to get started, I nevertheless soldiered on, waiting for that gotcha! moment when your heart's racing, adrenaline pumping as you quickly flip through the pages to discover how it will end. This ended up being like flat Coke. A total disappointment, not what I ordered, and no matter the name on the outside, it still sucked. Yes, it's certainly shorter than many of his other books--Thank heaven! Can't imagine wasting any more time than I already had. I felt cheated, wished I had my time back. One of the few books I actually threw at the wall when I was done, I was so ticked.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, and grab one of his other incredible books instead. And even if you're looking for an account of what it's like to be lost in the woods, that's been better written elsewhere, too.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|How well do we know those we love?  That is the question answered in this story.  A wife who appears to have it all together is completely blindsided by her husband's secret.  Fast read, quirky humor, interesting characters.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I cannot wait for the last season. We have watched all of those available now and just love this show. One of the best ever done I think. Walt gets more evil as time progresses, but all the actors are great. This was well worth the money and we will watch it again.... it has been a great ride seeing the change in all the characters. The writing, the actors, the story take you in and don't let you go. I am 66 and I think this has been one of the best series I remember watching. Buy it, you will love it
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|there isn't anything else like it. creative, beautiful.<br /><br />super cheap but worth way more because content is one of a kind.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I Can't wait until season 4.  Absolutely love this series.  One of the most riveting stories I have seen.  Love love love it.
B0038BBA4I|4.0|the lyrics are great, the music is great. i can listen to their songs over and over. and great price
B00F2362IE|3.0|Now I love the turtles, and I was really excited when this came to the kindle fire. but, I do wish that it ran smoother, and I would probably play it more often and buy coins. but otherwise its a great app.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Is this not brilliant or what?  Best use of lyrics with a new beat...ec you did it again and that is why we love you! Can you hear me? Thank you. Radio silence. Re/invent with the roots. Like it!...if I hold my hand outstretched....long time fans are digging it. He delivers again! Thank you all.
B00428CPUY|5.0|If you enjoy great music, go ahead and invest in this footage. It was great to see Eric in the back taking pictures during the show! I enjoyed every minute, and just can't wait until the next Crossroads is released!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Awesome!!!&#34; Incredible writing and no bad song. Ffdp best band, in years. Interesting on every level. Love it!!!!&#34; Can't wait for Vol. 2
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is sad... but truly a great love story that is based on reality not a vampire flying into your bedroom window. I absolutely loved it, I will really miss these characters.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The quality of script & acting continued to be superb.  The storyline was great.  It is unfortunate that one of the lead actors has decided to leave the series!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Found it very entertaining and can't wait for the following season. Chose to see it back to back, rather than on TV on the history channel.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|I'm not big into sci-fi type movies but I really enjoyed this movie a lot, as well as the kids!
B001BKV9TE|5.0|Awesome movie of the pyramid era kinda touches on theories on how the pyramids were constructed , fake gods and the power of the masses
B00EJB44VW|3.0|The first third of the book was enjoyable and interesting. Information here was new to me in many ways. The bibliography was necessary, but too long for continued enjoyment of the book.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|Great buy! Our daughter loved it. Definitely worth the price since it includes furniture! Would recommend for all mh fans!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I can't believe people didn't like this movie. Just because it didn't follow the book. It was a strong story on its own.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The movie sucked but there was plenty of eye candy to make up for the crappy parts!! I watched it on my kindle. Dnt think i will ever rent another movie on such a small screen. I switched to my laptop and the picture was low quality. Oh well!! Channing tatum is still hot
B0052Z0MJW|4.0|Good read although somewhat drawn out and repetitive at times. I would recommend this to all Dan Brown fans and even those who like a bit of intrigue and pondering moral dilemmas.
B00DQVST76|1.0|I got the DVD today and tried to play it on a Dell Inspiron using Windows Media Player and it crashed my computer! The root menu screen showed disjointed images with broken sound and then the display went black and Windows Media Player crashed. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD until they fix the problem!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|What do I mean by hiccups as well as the positives?<br /><br />1. Setup - Requires another wireless device to set it up. I couldn't set it up from a device/computer hardwired to my router....the setup device MUST also be a router connected wireless device.<br /><br />2. Setup - To set up chromecast using a MS Windows wireless device, the device CAN'T be an Win XP device (at least I couldn't get it setup with my Win XP netbook). I only had a XP wireless netbook so I had to borrow my wireless laptop from work which runs Win 7. If you run iOS/android/Win 7 wireless devices you can set up no problem. Heck I even have a Chromebook and couldn't set it up with that. But when I was able to final do the setup, it was very quick...less than 2 minutes.<br /><br />3. The good - AFTER I setup my Chromecast with my the Win 7 laptop I borrowed from work, my Win XP netbook worked fine as far as casting youtube videos from Chromecast (haven't tried Google Play or Netflix yet). So it seems that only setup requires a Win 7 device (or iOS/Android). I haven't tried my Chromebook yet but I believe it will work since the main issue I had was the correct wireless device needed to do the actual setup process. Also not sure about my wired desktop...but the chrome browser and youtube shows that I do have a \\"cast\\" icon.<br /><br />4. The good -  You do NOT need to have a USB port on your TV. You MUST have a free HDMI port on your TV. Chromecast simply uses USB to power the device. Chromecast comes with a USB cord PLUS a USB power outlet adapter plug. So if you don't have a USB on your TV, you can just plug the USB into the power adapter which then plugs into a standard electrical wall outlet.<br /><br />It was a bit frustrating that I couldn't set up the Chromecast with a Win XP device or a hardwired (non-wireless device directly connected to my router). I had to wait to set up my Chromecast until the next evening when I brought my work Win 7 wireless laptop home. Not sure what's up with that,but that is the way it goes I guess.<br /><br />Anyway, after the Chromecast was finally set up it has worked flawlessly to cast youtube videos. And the videos are crisp without any stutter. I do own a Roku and mainly want to be able to cast youtube, which Roku has completely failed to implement for some strange reason. I also love the fact that I can use a freaking keyboard (using my little old netbook) - another thing that Roku has completely failed to incorporating into their product - which I am in complete disbelief of (the search method with their remote it truly cumbersome, slow, and down right annoying. But as a caveat, I love the freedom from cable that Roku brings to TV).<br /><br />I do hope other streaming organizations support Chromecast. I particularly want Vimeo to support chromecast. Roku has it...but again without a keyboard, searching for video's is beyond terrible IMO. It is Sept 21st and the last real report back on July 31st indicated Vimeo and Redbox would support Chromecast. Not sure why it is taking them so long to implement casting through Chromecast.<br /><br />Anyway, for $35 bucks this little thing can't be beat for youtube, play, and netflix. Just make sure you have access to an appropriate wireless device on your network that you can use to setup the Chromecast.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game absolutely amazing awesome so cool  can't wait for updates<br />this game is beautiful you can make dinosaurs and mammoths. it's awesome
B005LAII62|4.0|I Thought this movie was funny and unique. Yes it is a dark animated comedy with some slight language and very slight sexual innuendos, but that makes it funnier for adults and teens. Parents complaining about sex, violence and language should research movies before allowing their kids to watch them (IMDB anyone?) or watch them first before letting the kiddos see them. Just because a film is animated doesn't mean it's Blue Clues.
B00BP0O7QW|2.0|I specifically ordered the book with the Original cover.  When I received it, it was the New cover with the picture of The Movie on the cover.  I was not happy since I specifically asked for the original Cover. I paid more the the &#34;Edition Original&#34;.
1611761808|3.0|Khaled Hosseini has set the bar very high with his storytelling ability and I had hoped to be blown away by this novel.  I really felt like it  would have been better as a collection of short stories.  I found myself reading them as short stories, some better than others.  I had trouble reading it as a novel and found myself tempted to skip ahead to the next story to see if those characters were more interesting, etc.  There is still brilliant writing here, definitely worthy of your time to read.
0064410935|5.0|I have always loved this story and was happy to pass it onto my daughters. It is still somewhat hard to find good children's books with strong female leads so this is a must in our house.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved all the fifty shades books - its twisted and some of it is dark but it is a great story and I love the characters
B002JXK5VU|5.0|All 5 seasons are really good fun with real science mixed in. You will laugh and think at the same time
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all the fifty shades books - its twisted and some of it is dark but it is a great story and I love the characters
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Tons of fun! Puzzles are intriguing and hidden objects games are addicting. Only down part is the amount of time it takes to reload.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Do not buy coins!  This game is kind of a joke. It's fun but tries to rip you off. Notice how when you can get double or triple coins none drop!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is by far the best book ever aside from the first one!! I am aching to read the next one! I have seen both movies and my favorite character has to be peeta!! I just love the series even more that twilight just so much suspension!!! This is a book I definitely would recommend to anyone!!!!!!!!!&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
B004A8ZX28|1.0|Could not even watch, very disappointed. My husband is dying of cancer, hospice has been called in, and was trying to buy a few movies to spend some quiet time with him.... That was ruined.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As you can see I have reviewed every hunger games book and am just now coming back  to review this one...

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was a really good book, I love the fact that she keeps adding more and more twists and turns in it! Looking forward to the next one
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Epic collaboration of artists! Jimmy Paige needs this respect which it portrays which earlier generations haven't been able to experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its the best you could connect with your facebook and everything you could get in  to it and if you get it soon you could get the world tour its the best
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I Loved this book so much it was AMAZING!<br /><br />I liked how detailed it was, and I also liked how much Roald Dahl made the Trunchbull sound like a wicked witch
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is so inspiring. At first I looked at it from a negative perspective so I couldn't really enjoy it as much in the beginning. But the development of the story getting to the middle is fantastic.
1476733953|5.0|Could not put it down.  Can't wait for Ridley Scott to make the movie.  But he will probably change the title.  I would have liked the characters to be more fully developed and described.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game for passing the time while you are waiting for something or even if you have nothing to do! Recommend it to anyone!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|has that new product smell. perfect. all the movies in one box. now i dont have to buy each movie individually
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Cute but I had a hard time exiting. Not clearly marked onscreen. I really tried it to check out my microphone which wasn't working.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It keeps you entertained. You want to just keep looking for clues to get to next level. Not difficult but it keeps you guessing and looking for all the clues.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this game and now it's out and I was the 5th person to get it but yeah great game look at the creatures thinking outside the box
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice during travel. Good at bedtime.  Works well.  A lot of fun. I am glad that I found this nice game.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I think the acting is great and story lines great. Now on that note I do not appreciate wasting my time being told to write a certain amount of words. I get that enough at work!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a riveting story and I really loved it!  I couldn't stop reading until finding out what the husband's secret was, and even though it was shocking, I could still feel sympathy.  I also loved the ending and thinking about &#34;what could have been&#34;.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this hidden objects game. Very challenging yet not too difficult. It is hard for me to put down once I pick it up. One if the best hidden objects games I have played!
B006LSZECO|3.0|It ended as it must; no way around that. I liked the &#34;He says, she says&#34; aspect of it. I didn't throw it across the room like I did &#34;The Collector&#34;
B0089LOG02|5.0|Beautifully written book; I've never read anything on this subject matter before, but I will not forget it.  The best way I can describe this book is &#34;haunting&#34;.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great tv series to watch if you are looking for a show that has a interesting plot line and fantastic actors!
B004ADH1RI|3.0|Good story but crude language is not appropriate for kids.  The story could have stood on its own merits.  It is too bad the language is so poor.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Now we are ready for the next three movies. This one was entertaining but some things did not make sense for the year this was supposed to have taken place. Good job connecting the dots at the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great character development in beautiful settings, good historical perspective  And you realize afterwards that you're thinking about what happened as if they were real people.  So much fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|good anytime of the day  most funnest game ever i love it you should totally get the app plz dont judge me if i spelled wrong im only 9 1/2
B00846REIS|3.0|I wanted a book to read after 50 shades. There are many similarities, but has its differences. I was satisfied with the book and I am going to read the next. I had not read a book since high school,20 years, so 50 shades was my first. The shock was what hooked me, so when I read \\"bared to you\\" I was sort of used to it. I'm hoping the second book gives me more drama and less sex. I gave a 3 because it kept me interested but found my self skimming through the last third of the books sex parts, I got it already.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. Will keep downloading every time it quits. I play winning game and 95% of the time i win.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|This book is filled with pure awesomeness. It is a must read and you will never guess who the murderer is until the very end.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Great app love the new telepods! I cant wait for the new update to come out,because i already beat the game.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|So awesome and its first person shooter too.this is just great I don't have to worry about taking a Xbox any where I have my own awesome greatest greatest first person shooter game here.
B008AX1HD8|2.0|Very weird novel... the author has used the folklore of Australia and chewed it until it becomes a very stale, boring, dragging old chewing gum... I suggest to skip it unless you are really interested in knowing a little bit about Hole's history and his drinking problem...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I loved this game while I had a iPhone. I was pretty happy to find it had been ported over to android. It's fairly easy at first, then it slowly gets harder, which is great for a puzzle game. But it doesn't get so hard you'll never beat it though.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend it to those who like puzzle games.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Note to all the lip-synching, auto-tuned and computer programmed \\"musicians\\" raking in all those big bucks out there: this magical release shows you how it's done. No choreography, fog machines or shooting flames, just REAL, unadulterated American music, performed without pretense or hyperbole (or pay, for that matter). As pure and genuine as an infant's smile.<br /><br />THIS is why God created music.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is such an amazing book. It's the first start off to this amazingly well put and well said story and series. The story line is deliberately well written. I recommend this book to any young adults.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Great movie and would suggest everyone I know to what. Learned a great deal about my faith and the power of forgiveness
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Beautifully crafted, attention to the tiniest detail, extremely believable characters with rich depth... I feel as if I am actually there, observing, and I don't want to go home...
B004K58GSO|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars because its among my favorite boyhood movies. It has it all...comedy, western shootouts, drama, action, and even a hint at romance and backstory that preceeds the film. One of John Wayne's best films in my opinion.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fantastic! Love the instant streaming. No commercials...makes it easy to catch up on past seasons without paying extra to do so.
B00E00RB5I|4.0|Good CD have great tunes like what they did should go up on the current status! Love what they did.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My kids love this game, and it does promote creativity, but sometimes they get carried away- the minecraft videos on youtube are not for kids, and are full of profane language.  I have had problems with my nine year old in regards to that.  Be mindful of the people your kids are playing with online, also.  My kids only hook up together among themselves via wifi.  It is a very popular game- I don't understand it since the graphics are no better than Mario Bro's on Nintendo, and the concepts are pretty simple, too.  Also, the game does have a tendency to be violent- depending on the player, of course.
B004X80QNG|1.0|product has many addons which need to be bought, its not complete, and looks very cluttered all over, its a small screen a good GUI is important which i dont believe this APP has.
0143038583|5.0|Mr. Pollan is a good writer who does proper research and doesn't insult his readers  I love the first person narrative. Great read!
B0057R5G6E|5.0|This was a gift for my son who is very much into the Jurassic park theme. Great deal for all three movies and a neat looking statue. My son loved it.
030789701X|5.0|This book is massive and extremely impressive. If you're a Skyrim fanatic, you definitely need to purchase this book. It includes Skyrim and all three DLC's. It's over 1100 pages of awesome. Get it now.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of his best.  Great story.  Intelligent,  witty,  what a background on prisons &  witness protection.  Script is great.  What a writer!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Whattt?? From about 80% on, I kept thinking &#34;How could Sylvia possibly wrap this story up?!&#34; Well, she didn't. Fortunately for us readers, Eva and Gideon's tale will continue with another installment. Entwined with You had me captivated from beginning to end. 5/5!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had heard about this series for so long until I decided to try it.  It's wonderful!  I will hate to see it end.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book has been hanging out on Wish-list for some time now. I feel as if I've been starving for weeks, when all along there was this deliciously fulfilling story just 8 bucks away. Brilliant. Heartfelt. Gut retching. Inspiring. A story that will remain with you long after you have read the final page.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Enjoy the Lord of the Rings?  You will love the Hobbit!  Get this video and features ... get ready for the second installation &#34;The Desolation of Smaug&#34; coming out in December.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|&#34;That's the thing about pain, it demands to be felt.&#34; This beautifully, raw story lets us see through the eyes of living with cancer. We see the physical pain and the internal struggle of guilt of having the disease, but also unconditional love and acceptance. There is no doubt in my mind, no matter what type of book you enjoy, you will fall in love with Hazel, Augustus, and their story.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Ive seen most of the series 1-5 and continuing, and think this one is by far the best season out of them all.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|When this came out in the movies, I went the first time a  alone, I brought a friend the second time, and a member of my family the third time; that was all in one week, and we all loved it. Now I have the DVD of Hamlet and will probably watch/rewatch it a lot -  Branagh's performance is wonderful. Wish I had this particular version/performance for my English class in high school.
0330345052|1.0|This book was definitely not worthy of Ken Follett's magnificent writing skills.  It was pretty boring, not much plot.  Tries to make a point, but it isn't worth it.
B003UYV08E|4.0|Now, I know the hero is usually the favorite but I am going to flip it. My favorite character was Mickey Rourke's Whiplash. His Russian accent was flawless. And he scared the heck out of me with the cracking whips. He can do anything, I am convinced. It takes a lot to scare me. This is not usually my kind of movie but I really enjoyed the heck out of it. Thank you Amazon.com. You came through for me yet once again.
0525951652|5.0|This book gives a solid foundation of world culture pre-WW 1 and the events leading us into the war. Through following the lives of individuals in the various class systems, Mr. Follet gives us a great understanding of an age that preceded ours.  It is interesting, suspensful, and very well written.
B00BESCJII|4.0|Enjoyed this well-acted, funny and sentimental coming of age movie.  Would like to own it.  Not recommended for small children.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I enjoyed this book from a historical perspective and Reza Asian is quite factitious about reminding the reader it is history not faith based.  My only complaint is that he is so conscious about making that point that at times it seems to draw the narrative out.  People who think the world is 6,000 years old are going to pan this book anyway, often without reading it based on some of the other reviews, so why not just tell it as history for the interested lay people like me who find the historical Jesus more interesting than the mystical.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I have the entire collection and still can't wait every season to order it when it comes out.  All purchased through Amazon.  Service is good, same quality as anywhere else and It comes to my door.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Disc two of this set will not play.  So I was very disappointed.  First time I ever had a problem with a dvd that I ordered from amazon.
B00915G6NK|5.0|Action, comedy, drama?  Who could ask for more? Now adding a bit of romance makes it why it's the perfect show for all.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|A bigger budget from the original. However, something is lost. Not that scary but extremely gory.  The original had humor of which this remake is lacking.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|This is a sweet little weather app that makes checking all weather info simple to read!  I really like it.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Make sure that you use a cord that is properly matched to your phone, and that you connect to the correct USB port (Apple or Android).
B00003CXCQ|3.0|I only bought it because my grand daughter asked for it. I don't recommend fairy tales for girls. We need stories of empowerment for them.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is really a great app.  Easy to use.  It will remember where is last stop page.  I really love this app
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great.  It is absolutely wonderful and has many different reading plans, bible versions and options such as highlighting that help you maintain a good reading plan.  Additionally, you can download the bible so you do not have to be connected to the internet to read it.  Another function that is amazing is the ability for the app to &#34;read&#34; the bible out loud to you.  This is great when you are laying in bed and have headphones in while trying to go to sleep.  I love this app!!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I was more confused by this fanciful tale than anything else.<br />The story did hold my interest, but it may be more suited to the tastes of teens.<br />The story was so implausible that I almost gave up reading it.<br />The characters were dull and the little boy/grown man who was the main character did nothing to solicit my empathy.<br />I wanted to shake him and tell him to get a grip!<br />Though this book wasn't at all what I expected, I did finish it.<br />It does have some lessons, though subtle, about bullying.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|My son loved this book. He thought it was funny and held his attention. He has recently started 3rd grade
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's great I have been playing it for almost a year and I love it. Recommend it.you will love it. You will never be board.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Great movie!!! Diffidently one of my families favorites!!! No bad words.. Or anything of that sort... A must see for all!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Unlike other free games, you can get pretty far without spending real money. I like the realistic graphics and the variety of tasks to perform. You can only compete so much before you have to groom or feed your horse or clean the paddock. I think it would be best for ages 10 to adult due to the complexity of the game.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I've watched this ten times.  Never ceases to amaze me.  Tears and smiles!  Everybody I share it with is hooked
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|This was a seriously bad movie. I had never seen a Zombie movie before -- not my thing -- but I allowed the opinions of others to entice me with raves about Brad Pitt (whom I like) and that this was not bloody. Well, it was bloody - bloody bad. No more zombies for me. I'll stick to vampires. They sparkle and are more romantic. Mostly, this just bored me.
