B00132D808|5.0|When I first heard that Panic's new album was based off The Beatles and the music of the 60's I didn't believe it, not that they would not do it, but that it wouldn't work. I mean think about it. Here's a band that previous work includes techno-y dance rock and some odd mix between folk and pop-punk. Now they're trying to explore 60's pop and psychedelic rock?! It's hard to believe. Either way I got the album the day it came out only being familiar with the single \\"Nine in the Afternoon'. As I was driving home with my friend we popped it in. I told him it was based on The Beatles, he was skeptical. In minutes, we were both blown away. Is it possible to be nostalgic and fresh at the same time, because that's what this is. I personally love The Beatles, and find this album absolutely amazing! The Beatles took create years creating the immense sprawling albums like Abbey Road, and it seems that by the second album. Panic has been able to create that same sound. That's not to say that they \\"ripped off\\" The Beatles, but wow! Even if you don't appreciate the Beatles, Dylan, and the music that was channeled into this wonderful creation, just the evolution of the band is amazing. Panic is done being Fall Out Boy's little sidekick, They're headlining their own shows, and now they have their own sound to go along with it.
B000007NYS|5.0|I saw her recently on the David Letterman Show perform a song from her new disc and I can't say I wanted to run out and buy it. But this CD has something for everyone; rock, blues, great lyrics... There are two versions of \\"Side of the Road\\" on it. One is a studio recording and another is live. I go back and forth between which one I like better. She is a very good song writer who speaks from the heart. Her voice can be a little edgy at times but she is original. I also like \\"Something about what happens\\" as a ballad with great lyrics and acoustic guitar playing. My friend Jim and I did a backpacking trip and drove 10 hours to get to the trailhead. He had this tape in his car and I was hooked after the first time he popped it in. A great album and association with it.
B000NYT1M6|3.0|Shiny & very handsome; what I always wanted as a kid but never got. However, swiveling doors & mirrors are very flimsy plastic, had to be reworked to open easily & are too delicate for 4 or 5 yr. old. Must yank on truck bed to open. Tires & body sturdy but more suitable for indoor play. Front wheels do not turn so truck has to be skidded around curves. Definitely not for child who likes to ride on or crash his trucks. A bit smaller than advertised: 20\\" L, 6.75\\" W, 9\\" Ht. Too bad it isn't made out of metal.Overall more luxurious than practical.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|First of all, as everyone who is looking at this album knows, GNR unleashed some kick a** rock, and are an icon of the 80's, despite their early flameout and general lack of albums. This set cherry picks the cream of the crop hits, like Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, Sweet Child O' Mine, November Rain, and You Could Be Mine.   What I could have done without was everything from their Spaghetti Incident album - where the band performed covers of songs it was clearly not designed for, and axl seems to be mocking the original artists with his renditions. Post - modern expressionism? Maybe. Social Commentary on how much society has changed? Perhaps. Good music? NO! What is especially sad is that they fit these atrocities on here, yet they couldn't find room for some of their second - tier classics, like Night Train, Mr. Brownstone, and My Michelle?   If you're a casual fan who only knows of Guns N' Roses by what you heard on the radio, this should suffice. However, the better option is to get Appetite for Destruction and download the MP3's of their best songs not included on that album.

B0010X73ZG|4.0|..then give this movie a shot. I didn't read the Stephen King Novella, so I  assumed a story about some supernatural force.. like a ghost ship, looking to wipe out a small group of townsfolk. I was wrong, it's much more than that. Suspenseful movie throughout, and the ending scenes took me by surprise.<br /><br />Without spoiling much of the plot, I'll stop here, and let you see it yourself. Although we have some unanswered questions, I think this movie puts the overly-hyped Cloverfield to shame.
0375757856|4.0|Wilkie Collins was an English writer who penned one of the first and greatest detective stories with his novel, The Moonstone in 1868.  He not only portrayed suspense, excitement, and doubt all at the same time, but he also created a great mystery with his story of a stolen diamond.    While writing The Moonstone, Collins was grieving the loss of his mother and was also sick with rheumatic gout.  His grief and illness crippled him and caused him great pain.  In The Moonstone, Collins includes a character burdened with a similar illness, and thus portrays the type of pain he himself was going through.  However, Collins persevered through his illness and pain to continue publishing parts of his story each week in the newspapers so he would not disappoint his English and American readers.    The mystery in The Moonstone draws the reader into exotic settings and characters which spice up the story that begins in India in 1799.  An English Colonel steals a breath-taking yellow diamond from the forehead of the moon-god statue and returns to England.  However, there is a curse on the person who takes the sacred gem from its intended purpose, and the curse extends to the person's family.  Upon the Colonel's death, the diamond is passed on to his niece in England in 1848 on her eighteenth birthday.  The diamond is stolen the very night it is presented to her at her birthday party with many guests and servants in attendance.  From here on, through narratives written from the points of view of different characters, the story falls deeper into mystery, and the characters are not who they seem to be on the surface.  The reader keeps wondering who took the diamond and why.  The mystery is many-sided and is truly not entirely revealed until the very end, certainly not disappointing the reader, who has been taken on a long but fascinating ride.  The Moonstone definitely stands out because it is written in nineteenth century English.  For an American reader, it is almost like stepping into a different time and culture.  However, the old-fashioned English often times causes the reader to reread some of the words and phrasing in the sentences, lengthening the reading process.  But overall, the mystery and its unraveling are fascinating, methodical and well-organized.  The only drawback is that it takes the reader 552 pages before his curiosity is finally satisfied.     A.C.
B000N3Q1VG|5.0|I have one of the original copies from 1977. It is a great and scary story. A true classic. A must read for thrill fans. This is an American treasure of psychological thrill literature.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|A wonderful animated film, Ratatouille, brings to the screen the story of a rat that loves cooking and a young man that is hopeless at it. When the two meet they will team up and take the world of refined cuisine by surprise...  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come alive)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.    The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all excellent!  In short, Ratatouille is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Antz, The Ant Bully, Cars, Flushed Away, Hoodwinked, Madagascar, Monsters Inc., and Over the Hedge. 4.5 Stars
B0002STNQ2|5.0|This is one of M.C.'s very best in terms of a page-turner. I literally couldn't put this book down because the story was so engaging and the plot was arranged so smoothly.<br /><br />The idea is very interesting...nanotech beings becoming slef-aware and acting live a swarm. I would recommend this as the first Crichton book for new readers that want to try this author out.

B000002KD9|5.0|Oh my people, I have been very busy of late. Aside from the daunting task of saving humanity, I have been asked by reknown editors to submit my reviews for a book they are considering. It will be called, \\"Metamorpho: The Seering Stone Reviews\\". Catchy title, ey? And, many of them will be culled from the very reviews my fanatical fans have read on these very pages! Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking why you should pay for old, retread reviews? Not so my people! Proofreaders will be on hand to spice things up and apply the honored Hemingway method of economical writing (still popular in Florida and France) to my masterpieces. Of course, I will have final approval. Don't I always? ;)<br /><br />But, to the point, this is about Neil Young's folk-rock paragon \\"After the Gold Rush\\". This one stands out and is notable for the obvious growth in songwriting and lyrics. In this offering, Neil Young discovers the piano, and how that instrument can augment his compositions in many wonderous ways. He utilizes this for quiet, reflective mood. But also, as an integral part for his externalized topics. We have varying degrees of emotion in love. We have dismay and elevation. We cover the gamut of human concerns here. This is what makes it so extraordinary.<br /><br />There are many interpretations of the title. Ask yourself what comes after the \\"gold rush\\"? Certainly that could apply to the depletion of mother earth, but also to what comes after that initial fascination and \\"rush\\" of emotions with new love. A clever title. And Neil is more than competent to deal with these issues.<br /><br />He begins with \\"Tell Me Why\\", a straight on folk tune. But I am taken with the lyrics here. The imagery and superb lyric of \\"sailing hardships, through broken harbors\\" is a wordplay of the highest form. But then, a familar Neil Young dilemma enters, \\"Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself? When you're old enough to repay but young enough to sell\\"? Again, Neil's constant challenge: that old netherworld between childhood and adulthood. This theme plays out in many of his songs.<br /><br />Next is \\"After the Gold Rush\\", a mournful piano excursion dream that encompasses medieval times, the apocalypse, and leaving a dying planet. \\"Look at mother nature on the run\\". Indeed. Next up is \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\". A beautiful soft folk-rock ballad that, for all it's simplicity, conveys the wisdom of mature truth. How true. Only love can, and does, break one's heart.<br /><br />\\"Southern Man\\" then gives Neil a chance to not only express his outrage towards historic treatment of the black man in the south, but also gives him a chance to qualify that transgression with blistering lead. Notice here how his admonitions change voice. He takes on the voice of a southern bossman. But, taking liberties such as this makes the whole song work on a visionary level.<br /><br />Next, Neil asks us to wait \\"Till the Morning Comes\\". A very, short bouncy tune, it begs further investigation. Obviously, not telling you who, what, where and why, leaves it up to your mind to interpret what it means. Artistry at work folks! We then proceed onwards to that Don Gibson classic \\"Oh Lonesome Me\\", which conveys lost love and loneliness perfectly with slow moving piano and harmonica. All the gold miners have long gone home after this composition.<br /><br />Next song is a gem. Depressing signs and ominous situations beg an inner reflection of truth. \\"Com'on down to the river of sight\\", Neil urges. The truth, finally revealed -<br /><br />\\"Don't let it bring you down,<br />it's only castles burning,<br />find someone who's turning,<br />and you will come around\\".<br /><br />\\"Birds\\" is a beautiful piano and chorus composition. It's about love that has died and the need to fly away. It is in a song like this that Neil has the ability to show courage, compassion and the strength to move on. This is why he is such a superb songwriter. He then rocks, just a bit, with \\"When You Dance You Can Really Love\\", a romantic joy romp which leads into the plea of a dissolving relationship with the waltz-like \\"I Believe in You\\". A last stand perhaps?<br /><br />Neil then returns to the south with \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\".  A short snippet that conveys so much about relationships. In his own way, Neil knows that he is a gambler in love, just as we all are. The gold rush is over. It is the second half of the cruise. He hates to lose but, after all, he is on a \\"cripple\\" boat at best. With Neil, all these connections and visions come into play. I think this is one of the reasons he is the artist he is today.<br /><br />In many ways, this was an overwhelming and gigantic step in Neil Young's career. I have loved it from the moment I heard it, and it has lost nothing over the years. If you like folk rock, even tempered and balanced with reflection in full supply, then this is definitely one of the very best. Beautiful and one of a kind, I recommend it highly! Now I must get back to the proofreaders about my reviews. We are fighting about the inclusion or exclusion of the word \\"the\\" in one of my reviews. I fear this may be a long process and you might see my book in, hmmmmm.... maybe five years?

0321525655|5.0|'Presentation Zen' starts with a very bold proposal, you have to change and stop following the way everyone uses PowerPoint, forget bullet points, use of too much text, lot of ideas cramped in one slide, not to use presentation as contents holder, etc.<br />Like in Zen philosophy, the first things you need to recognize are the flaws in your reality, and then embrace a new way of thinking and doing. In the case of presentations and keynotes, you need to understand how to effectively share ideas (read 'Made To Stick'), and the logic of a changing world (read 'A Whole New Mind'), and apply this to build, simple, emotional, easy to follow presentations.<br />This book applies, through a lot of analogies, elements of the japanese culture because it stands out about thinking and executing everyday things.<br />It's not just a book that teaches you a new technique, it encourages your heart and mind to be creative, innovative and free. And the latter its what makes this book even more valuable.

If you want to success in nowadays environment, you really need to have clear ideas, with strong basis, easy to understand by others and with minimal possibility to get lost in the execution stage.<br />Heath brothers made a profound research about the 'ingredients' of successful ideas, and in this book they share their findings, moreover, they teach you how to apply this principles in you daily life so your ideas can reach a high level of achievement.<br />I believe that this book will become a classic and a it will be a basic reading, just because good ideas increasingly rules who wins.
0143038419|1.0|There are already over 200 negative reviews of this book, so I don't know that I have much to add, except that my main reason for disliking the book is that I didn't find the author very likable.  First off, this trip is all expenses paid by her book publisher, so that took away some of her credibility for me.  Secondly, I just found her a bit too braggy and self absorbed to truly appreciate her stories.  I hope the author is a nicer, more humble person in reality than she comes across in this book.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|omg i love this set i loved this series ever since my girlfriend made me watch it! at first i hate dthis show i thought it was too girly and had no real plot. boy was i wrong! i absolutly love this show im flying through it i got it a couple days ago and already am on the fifth disk of the first season!! the packaging was nice but a lil too girly i have to hide the fact that i have this set from my friends cuz if they saw it i'd never live it down! but i absolutly love this set and any fan or newbie to the series would love this set i must say that my only concern is the fact that since they crammed this set together with every episode they put each season in a paper folder thing that im afraid will scratch the disks after a while and the extras aside from wehats on each disk arent that important. i mean it comes with 2 books. one is an episode guide that shows a lot of photos of the cast and a synopsis of each episode and its orginal release date which was fun to read but the other book is useless and no fun. it is a book of pop culture referencesthat were brought up in the show so i dont think its important because if you didnt get them when they were relevent then its just stupid to get them now. its like getting a joke long after it was told.

B000TZCSE2|5.0|What would you do, if a mysterious plague swept throughout the world, literally killing everyone off, but leaving in its place something new, something frightening, something downright horrible, while leaving you alive, immune and seemingly alone? What would you do, if the undead now walked the earth looking for you, the last man alive...the last vestige of the human race? What if what they wanted was the taste of your blood on their lips? Just what on earth would you do?<br /><br />These are the questions that faced Robert Neville. It is he who is Legend. How he answers them is what makes this a book to remember and a classic within its genre. It is a book of profound hope and despair. It is a book that demands to be read. Read it. You will not be disappointed.
B00078807U|1.0|I purchased this movie some time ago, but was disappointed because there is no English voice track.  Since then, I have seen clips of this movie on the Internet with English.  When I saw this product with the discription of languages both Japanese and English; I thought I found a new product.  I was more disappointed when I found that I had just purchase the same movie again.<br />This is a great movie, and I know if I knew Japanese I would enjoy it even more, but I am just a dumb country boy that would like to watch it in my own language.<br />Sure would like to know where those clips are coming from...
B000WS4PCY|5.0|Bon Jovi does a country album?  Huh?  I really didn't know what to expect when I listened to it.  To tell the truth, it's a \\"Bon Jovi album\\" with steel guitar and a fiddle!  There is really no difference!  Country music has turned more rock 'n roll in the last decade that it doesn't really sound like \\"country\\".<br /><br />This isn't traditional country...this is a rock 'n roll album with a country nod.  A perfect collaboration!  Buy this, you won't regret it!
B000QUCNP4|3.0|Here's my problem with \\"Zodiac\\". We know going in that the case of the Zodiac Killer was never solved so basically this is a movie about people looking for something they're never going to find. And I don't know how you define dull? But for me, that's right up there. The performances are all fine. Jake Gyllenhaal is good, Anthony Edwards is good, Robert Downey Jr is always good. And the movie has a nice dark authentic look to it. The trouble is, it's just not scary. David Fincher stays true to his material here and, while that's admirable, it means that we never see the killer, never get into his head and never come to understand his need to kill. So what we're left with is simply a shadowy figure with a gun. A cardboard cutout of a killer. And while if you actually lived through the Zodiac era, that uncertainty, the knowledge that anyone you pass on the street might in fact have blood on his hands might be terrifying, that terror doesn't transfer to the screen. This film received a lot of praise when it came out and was nominated for several awards (Jake Gyllenhaal: \\"Teen Choice Award\\" for Actor: Horror/Thriller?) and maybe as a sort of documentary it deserved it. But as pure entertainment (And I have to admit here, I am a fan of pure entertainment.) it falls flat.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|Full of romance, comedy, and fantastical adventure, this is a great fairytale for adults as well as children. It's rated PG-13 but I think it's appropriate for kids younger than 13. If you liked Willow or Princess Bride you'll love this movie.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|This movie is aptly named Babel for its inability to convey what it is trying to say, if it is trying to say anything substantial at all. I am surprised at all the positive reviews. It seems the movie is so empty of meaningful content that it gives smug, brown-nosing, spineless movie experts much room make good with other movie elite.  People are afraid to say how bad this movie is because they might look dumb because they really don't know of anything substantial the movie is really about. You can't prove a negative. A real catch 22.

I really dont think he was palying his best music at this time, too much pressure from all the people around him and record companies wanting albums from him, the man was doing heroin too.... his mind was really going  in circles trying to please everybody... what a waste of talent to die so young, his best work was behind him I think, he was pushed in the wrong direction... too bad, best guitarest EVER by far....
B0010X745K|3.0|I've always been touchy about the idea of a film version of The Mist considering it's my favorite Stephen King story.  Plus, it's a story I'd rather remember the way I visualized it while reading it than anything that would end up on film.  I wouldn't have given this movie a second thought if it hadn't been directed by Frank Darabont, who's probably the best at sticking to King's books.<br />The Mist is a story of a group of people stranded in a grocery store surrounded by a thick mist full of Lovecraftian beasties.  Of course when you get a group of people together in this kind of horror movie situation, they tend to fall into the usual cliched categories of good guys and bad guys.  It then becomes more of a character study of human behavior, and the outside threat becomes secondary.  It's a premise as old as Night of the Living Dead, but it's a premise I've always found fascinating.<br />All in all I thought the movie was good.  With a few minor exceptions, Darabont is pretty much letter perfect with the King story.  The acting was all around decent and the pacing was good.  My only real complaints come with the creatures.  I don't care what anyone says, fully computer generated monsters do not look good.  They look like something from a video game, and I think it's a cop out to use them.  Animatronic creatures with computer enhancements would have been good because it would at least look like something was actually there with the actors, yet fluid moving enough so it didn't look totally fake.<br />The big controversy about The Mist is the ending.  No one will shut up about, so I guess I won't either.  This is the biggest difference between the novella and the movie.  King left us with an open, \\"choose your own ending\\" type of ending for the story.  Darabont leaves us with a grim Twilight Zone type of ending.  Darabont's ending left a real bad taste in a lot of people's mouths(including my wife who complained about it for the rest of the friggin night, totally ruining her mood and depriving me of the nookie I thought I'd be receiving.  Thanks, Frank!).  Of course if Darabont had used King's ending, people would have been whining about that too coz it robs the audience of the closure they so desperately need.  It's a true case of \\"damned if you do, damned if you don't\\".  I didn't hate Darabont's ending as much as most people did, though I didn't love it either.  I love the flipping of the bird to a Hollywood ending, we certainly need more of that kind of spirit in big budget movies.  It does have it's lapses in logic though.  NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE SPOILER THAT YOU NO DOUBT ALREADY KNOW:  A suicide pact is formed and carried out way too abruptly.  Sure the situation seemed hopeless, but it could have been much more hopeless.  You think you'd hold off on such a life changing decision until it's absolutely down to the wire, especially if your friggin' son is concerned!!  Oh, well.  The film had already been on for about 2 hours at that point, so I guess Darabont just wanted to cut to the chase.  But I do like the suicide and what came afterwards, it's the final slap in the audience's face.  It was just way too abrupt to be remotely realistic.<br />Stephen King writes in his notes in Skeleton Crew that if The Mist were a film, it'd be low budget, in black and white and shown on a drive-in screen.  What a wonderful thought, what a wonderful dream.  Unfortunately in this day and age it will never happen that way.  But I do have to say that for today's state of horror films, The Mist is one of the best we'll see, and Darabont made this great King story probably the best it could have been made.d and depriving me of the nookie I thought I'd be receiving.  Thanks, Frank!).  Of course if Darabont had used King's ending, people would have been whining about that too coz it robs the audience of the closure they so desperately need.  It's a true case of \\"damned if you do, damned if you don't\\".  I didn't hate Darabont's ending as much as most people did, though I didn't love it either.  I love the flipping of the bird to a Hollywood ending, we certainly need more of that kind of spirit in big budget movies.  It does have it's lapses in logic though.  NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE SPOILER THAT YOU NO DOUBT ALREADY KNOW:  A suicide pact is formed and carried out way too abruptly.  Sure the situation seemed hopeless, but it could have been much more hopeless.  You think you'd hold off on such a life changing decision until it's absolutely down to the wire, especially if your friggin' son is concerned!!  Oh, well.  The film had already been on for about 2 hours at that point, so I guess Darabont just wanted to cut to the chase.  But I do like the suicide and what came afterwards, it's the final slap in the audience's face.  It was just way too abrupt to be remotely realistic.  Stephen King writes in his notes in Skeleton Crew that if The Mist were a film, it'd be low budget, in black and white and shown on a drive-in screen.

0452286751|4.0|The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand tells the story of Howard Roark, an architect who struggles in his career in New York City. Roark is a strong believer in creating for oneself, which is basically the theme of the book: stay true to oneself and do not submit to collectivism. For example, he refuses to design buildings modeled after historical buildings such as the Parthenon. However, this historical style is greatly desired, and Roark meets hardships that come along with refusing to conform to society's norms.     In the book, Howard Roark is expelled from architectural school because he designs are so unorthodox. He moves to New York City, where he finds work in an architecture firm with a man whose buildings are similar to his. Roark's companion, Peter Keating, also moves to New York to be an architect. However, he builds buildings that are well-liked and popular. Roark struggles for a long time, trying to give his creations to the world, but they are rejected by most people.    Peter Keating is a popular guy, and everyone is drawn to him. He uses people to get ahead, which is kind of a not nice thing. He even uses Roark's talent to win a contest designing a building. Peter befriends a journalist named Ellsworth Toohey, who hates Roark and all forms of egoism. Toohey believes in being completely unselfish because that is the only way to be happy. But I think that's really stupid. Anyway, Roark goes to work at a granite quarry because he needs money. He meets there a woman named Dominique. She is really attracted to Roark, but he leaves before she knows his name.    Keating really wants Dominique because she's beautiful, but she is pretty much disgusted by him. Then Dominique and Roark meet again at a party in New York, and they fall in love all over again. But Dominique doesn't like that she submitted to love, so she punishes herself by marrying Keating. Roark is sad.     Gail Wynand is a crazy powerful man. He owns a newspaper called The Banner, for which Toohey writes. Gail is all about power and making money. He likes things to be efficient. He meets Dominique and wants her too. So he trades Peter for Dominique by offering him a lot of money. Dominique and Gail get married. Gail Wynand befriends Roark because they are both very similar. Roark builds a building for Gail, and they go on his yacht a lot.    Keating goes to Toohey because no one wants his buildings anymore. Toohey tells him to design an efficient housing project called Cortlandt Homes. Keating is a failure, and he can't do it. He goes to Roark for help. Roark agrees to build the homes, but he requires that they not be altered in any way. Keating agrees. The plans are changed by fellow developers, and Roark is upset because the contract was broken. He goes and blows up the construction site.    At the trial, Roark explains that he did so because he gave the world a gift, and by changing it, the gift was no longer his and it must be destroyed by its creator. He gives a really long speech about being true to oneself and that altruism is not a good thing. Toohey really hates Roark because of this belief. To see if he is proclaimed guilty or not-guilty, you'll have to read the book.    I really enjoyed The Fountainhead for the most part, but toward the end I had a hard time motivating myself to finish because I already knew the ending. A daunting thing is the fact that it is about 700 pages, but it is well worth the read. I highly recommend this for anyone if they like a challenge and really want to think about Ayn Rand's philosophy, objectivism. It really opens one's eyes.

0790737345|3.0|City of Angels isn't a bad movie like everyone said it was but it's not perfect either. This movie has flaws but the chemistry between Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan is sensual and extremely powerful. The supporting cast is electric as well, the story is a bit weepy which makes City of Angels a bit of a letdown. Great soundtrack so with that in mind, give this tearjerker a try.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I'd vaguely heard of this series and knew it was about a serial killer, which was a real turn off for me, so I never watched it on TV. However, I was assured by other people who had seen it that it was actually very good.  On that basis I picked up this box set when it became available to watch.  I'm glad I did.    Dexter is disturbed to put it mildly.  He's a monster who is only too well away of how different he is from other people and spends his life concealing, as much as possible his differences from other people. However, he can't escape his urge to kill but he has managed to channel it in such a way so that it is \\"productive\\". He works for the police and knows how to think like a cop and stay one step ahead of them from discovery till another serial killer comes to town and disturbs his carefully built up façade and his nice, neat killing schedule that works almost flawlessly for him.    This is a disturbing, but nevertheless compelling series to watch.  Dexter is a sociopath and knows it - what he doesn't know is what led him to end up like that and this series is as much about life - and discovery - as it is about death and dismemberment.  Despite my disgust at Dexter's actions this is a series I'll be getting season 2 of when it becomes available.    [[ASIN:0307277887 Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]    [[ASIN:B000V86OKG Dexter - Season 2]]

NOW IF YOU GOING WITH THE IDEAL THAT THIS MOVIE ISANYTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL VERSION WITH VINCENT PRICE LAST MAN ON EARTH FORGET THAT THIS IS OVERALL THE SAME IDEAL BUT THE FOCUS WAS MORE ON THE SCI-FI THEN THE STORY BUT ITS STILL FUN TO WATCH
B000XA5K48|1.0|This was by far one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. First time, I had to turn it off after 5 minutes; second time around (my boyfriend wanted to watch it) I stayed for the whole thing and was that a mistake! Was the scenario written by a 16-year-old? Waste of time - pick something else.
0142405787|4.0|I have read all of the Alex Rider books up to this one and think that this was one of the best.  The author has an amazing way with coming up with interesting villains and diabolical (if not sometimes ridiculous)plots for them to put to the test.  This was the first book in the series that I thought had some genuinely suspenseful moments (namely the landing of the plane with the sports team).  It also had quite a few multidimensional characters.  However, there were a few negative aspects to this book.  These include the fact that villians have something seriously against just shooting Alex and being done with it(with the exception of the sniper of course)and the second to last chapter.  I mean was it really necessary to make *SPOILERS AHEAD* John Rider such a good guy?  And if so, I find it very unrealistic that Mrs. Jones persisted in lying to Alex and making him believe that his father worked for Scorpia!  Even so, this was a well written book with a good plot and in my opinion, is worth 4 (or 4.5) stars out of 5.

A lot of his theories are spoken of in the bible but he elaborates and puts his own spin on bible passages.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|This is the best movie directed by Ridley Scott since Gladiator. First good idea: the opposition Crowe/Washington, it's unforgettable. Playing a tenacious cop and a smart gangster, both charismatic, they give outstanding performances. Second good idea: this true story is captivating, we follow with a great pleasure the evolution of these amazing characters. They show everything: style, honor, courage, charisma, respect, leadership. The film is just brilliant. Already a classic.
B000003N7K|5.0|Recognized for years as a Jazz Classic, an Essential Recording . . .  there is very little regarding this special recording that can be added that has not already been written. The qualities of these two great artists came together on this very special recording. It is simply that good. The technology through the years has improved and fortunately the remastering of this classic has been done well enough to give much deserved honor to the original vinyl rendering.     Hartman voice sounds as if he were in your room, while John Coltrane simplifies his music to support the \\"other instrument\\", the vocal (his only recording to do so). It takes genius and great self esteem to keep it within the boundaries of the entire ensemble; Coltrane did just this on this recording to his credit / genius.     This recording is a \\"must have\\" for any serious music fan. I have recommended it to a number of people and have never been told they were ever disappointed.    A wonderful start (or finish) to any evening.

'American Gangster' has a great cast, excellent production, interesting story, but for all it has going for it, the film didn't completely draw me in. It's certainly worth seeing, but I don't see myself watching this movie more than one or two more times......once to see the extended addition. I rate it 3 1/2 stars. Rent it before you buy it.

B0010X745K|5.0|As a huge fan of The Mist story by Stephen King, which I read in his Skeleton Crew [[ASIN:0451168615 Skeleton Crew (Signet)]] collection years ago, I was pleasantly surprised by the film version. It is a great movie that stays faithful to its source material while actually enhancing it with a bold, shocking ending.    For those unfamiliar with the story, The Mist is a dense, mysterious fog that envelops a small New England town following a violent storm. The plot centers around Drayton, a local artist, and his struggle to survive against both the inhabitants of the Mist and the skeptical townspeople who, like himself and his young son, are trapped inside a local supermarket. SPOILER: In the Stephen King tale, Drayton, his son, and a few others manage to escape the store, but the result is inconclusive; the story ends with them hearing the word HOPE on the radio as they drive, towards an unknown future, through the Mist.    Pros: The movie stays very close to the original story. The setting, the plot, the pacing, the characters, the mysterious mist and the creatures within...all is virtually the same, meaning most of the tension and fear you get from the story are retained in the film. The script does the job well enough, the special effects are excellent, and, for the most part, the actors give solid performances.    The ending, though, is really what sets this movie apart. It is the only significant part of the film that is decidedly different from the story, but that is a good thing. There is no resolution in King's original tale...the reader is just left wondering what will happen. I really admire the filmmakers for taking a chance and providing an ending that not only offers a resolution, but also provides the audience with a thought-provoking course of events that actually enhances the story and the overall theme. This is a story about fear, and how people react to that fear...the ending just captures that so well. Too many times, the viewer is left with an underwhelming resolution that feels more like a cop-out than anything else (3:10 to Yuma, for example)..this isn't one of those cases. SPOILER: I've read others complain that the ending just isn't realistic, that Drayton would've waited longer before doing what he did. Why? They drove until they ran out of gas...they hadn't seen anyone along the way, and the mist was still present. What would make him believe that getting out of the vehicle and continuing on foot was a good solution? And when they stopped, there were no other cars nearby from which to siphon gas. And, even if there were, why would he believe he'd survive outside long enough to do that?     Cons: The character of Mrs. Carmody is probably a little overdone, at least compared to the original story. Yes, she's a religious fanatic who becomes just as dangerous as the creatures in the Mist, but the character was a little too over the top. (I think the filmmakers felt the same way...in the commentary with the deleted scenes, the director explains a deleted scene with Mrs. Carmody by saying less was more.) Also, I thought the Norton character could've used a bit more fleshing out. You get the idea that he and Drayton don't care for each other, but the anatagonism in the original story comes though much better than it does in the movie.     All in all, this is a film not to be missed, especially if you're a fan of the story.
0385338724|3.0|This is a fun and quick read. However, in my opinion it is not the best from the author. Having read all of her other books this one is my least favorite, and I feel the most forgettable.  But, if you are looking for something fun to take to the beach or read on an weekend. This book is for you!!    Lexi wakes up and has forgotten the last 3 years of her life.  She is now married, lives in a posh apartment, has a handsome husband and is an ambitious career woman. She struggles to live in her \\"new\\" life but she finds it isn't really the way she wants to live anymore.  Her family is not very supportive nor is her \\"new\\" but actually not new, husband.  But in the end it is all good- leaving the reader with a nice feeling b/c it almost all works out!
B00132D808|5.0|I'm really rating it 4.5.    I loved Panic's first album, and couldn't wait for their sophomore album to hit stores.  I loved it.  It is slower than their last album, but that's not a bad thing.  Ryan's amazing lyrics are still very sarcastic, and brilliant.  Brendon even writes 2 of his own songs.    I've read most of the reviews on here, and I think I know the problem.  If you, who are reading this review, are a fan of Panic for their music and smart lyrics than you will love this album.  If you are a fan of Panic because they are easy to dance to, hot, and have some pretty catchy lyrics that don't seem to make sense, this album is not for you.    Some things I enjoyed:    I loved how 'We're So Starving' blended into 'Nine in the Afternoon' (much like BIBIYD and IWSNT blended together on their first album.)  I loved It when 'Do You Know What I'm Seeing?' came on, and Ryan's voice accented Brendon's.  I loved 'That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)' all together.  It's definately a stand out on the album.  I love how the title of the album is included in this song as part of the lyrics, and how it fades out at the end.  I LOVE Northern Downpour.  It is my favorite song.  The lyrics are the most beautiful I have heard in a while--\\"For diamonds do appear to be more than just broken glass to me\\".  Ryan's voice during the chorus is great.  I love how Ryan is singing.  His voice compliments Brendon's amazingly.  I love Pas De Cheval.  It's my second favorite song.  I hate the beginning of The Piano Knows Something I Don't Know, but after you get past the bad beginning you have an awesome song.  Beautiful lyrics.  This one gets stuck in my head the most.  I loved how 'Folkin' Around' isn't as bad as it sounds like it is going to be.  In fact it is a pretty good song.  I love 'She Had the World'.  It is a great song.  I love the line \\"you could love me if I knew how to lie.\\"   I love how they start 'Mad as Rabbits' off with saxophones, and it reminds me of a classic episode of SNL with The Blues Brothers.    All in all this is a great album.  Panic's witty lyrics are still intact.  Yes, they remind me of The Beatles, but big deal...The Beatles rock.    This album is a great follow up to A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.  No, it's not perfect, but what is?  There are a about 2 songs that I want to skip everytime I listen to it, but out of a 15 track CD that's not that bad.  Sorry my review was so long.  I hope I helped you a little.

B000AADYYO|5.0|(This was written around the time of the 2005 release)    Ghost Reveries is an amazing album. Those worried about a streamlined Opeth due to their signing by a major label can rest easy. This record defies categorization and is worthy of any album of the year title that may eventually be thrown its way. The superb songwriting, excellent instrumentation and extraordinary creativity is remarkable. For the sake of simplicity, this review will focus on the band members first, followed by a track by track overview as the second half.    Mikael Akerfeldt's singing here is top notch. His clean vocals have improved again, with even more styles and tones used throughout. He does much more clean singing for this album, making the point that Opeth aren't anything close to a straight death metal band anymore, though this has been true for years. When he does growl and shout, he demonstrates outstanding clarity and control despite his rage. Opeth's music just wouldn't be the same without his aggressive side. It makes some parts so powerful that it'll leave you stunned.     Of course, not everyone enjoys this aggressive style of singing. It's well known that Opeth have converted new fans who have had an extreme loathing of it before. Their progressive side makes them much more than \\"some death metal band with acoustics,\\" as some people are quick to say.    Akerfeld's guitar work, along with fellow axe slinger Peter Lindgren, is top notch. Their riffs, acoustic playing, clean and distorted solos, diversity and general interaction with each other are all impressive. They can manage everything from extreme death grinds to sad acoustic progressions to uplifting lead lines with exciting results. With Ghost Reveries, they've expanded their palette to include some doom metal influence, machine-like rhythms a la Meshuggah, and even some straight up rock and roll.    The drumming of Martin Lopez has reverted back to a more supportive roll this time around, but he still handles a variety of tasks without missing a beat. He's not as \\"up front\\" as on the previous album, Deliverance, but his pummeling double bass, complex rolls, tribal beats, and soft reserved navigation of his kit during quiet moments make him a perfect companion to the demanding guitars. It's a shame he's been forced to take a temporary hiatus from touring in order to tend to a health issue.    Martin Mendez still provides solid bass playing for his fifth album with the band. He complements the guitars and drums greatly, moving from speedy, technical sections to slow, calm bass lines as easily as Akerfeldt shifts from chaotic growling to mournful crooning. At this point in the band's career, Mendez fits like a glove.    The big news with Ghost Reveries is the addition of Per Wiberg on keyboards. Opeth have experimented with keys in the past, but a full-time participant lends the band even more depth than before. He's doesn't take the lead such as someone like Jordan Rudess of Dream Theater, but Wiberg's role gives him opportunities for many tasteful contributions. He lends aggressive sections a new level of drama, but he really shines during the quieter moments. Throughout the softer parts of the album, he plays a big part in setting an atmospheric mood that the band couldn't have accomplished without him. Along with the synthesizer sounds, he also integrates the mellotron and acoustic piano in several songs with results that can best be described as magical.    In the lyrics department, Akerfeldt still stick to lines such as \\"Nocturnally helpless / And weak in the light / Depending on a prayer,\\" meaning that he uses his words as an imagery tool rather than vague poetry up for interpretation. The lyrics are much darker than in the past, but they are employed in an artistic manner to seemingly tell the story of possession, destruction, and escape. There's debate on the internet rather or not this is a concept album, but it appears to be so. It's interesting stuff, so it's worth readingalong to the album if you have trouble deciphering what is being said.    The songs themselves are some of the best the band has ever written, but it's hard to describe them in such a short space because of their complexity and length. The opener, \\"Ghost of Perdition,\\" goes through several phases and is probably one of the best songs the band has ever written. They throw away any conventional verse-chorus-verse structure and constantly build up the song during its many peaks and valleys. This sets the tone for the rest of the album. The band has gotten rid of unnecessary things and kept what works, while incorporating new ideas and Wiberg's keyboard experiments with admirable results.    \\"The Baying of the Hounds\\" sounds like something off Deliverance or Blackwater Park. It's full of great riffs and solos, with plenty of quiet yet tense parts in between the occasional outbursts of fury. A fine song, but it's nothing revolutionary for Opeth.    After that track, Ghost Reveries is unlike any other Opeth album. \\"Beneath the Mire\\" incorporates some peculiar, almost ancient-Egyptian sounding keyboards over jagged guitars and a bouncy drum beat in the intro before a heavy middle section and a calm outro, which bleeds into the next track, \\"Atonement.\\"    Here is a song that pushes new ground for the band. Some slow, almost joyful lines, guitar lines backed by lush soundscapes and acoustics, give way to Akerfeldt's effect-laden vocals. It is a unique tune that is a nice, mellow departure you can relax to. After a brief intro into the next track, you are treated to the longest song on the CD.    \\"Reverie / Harlequin Forest\\" gets by on excellent riffs and some of Akerfeldt's best vocal melodies on the album. It stays relatively calm most of the time, even though there is a lot of distortion throughout half the song. It doesn't get heavy until the last quarter, ending in an odd rhythmic pattern where the guitars, bass and drums coordinate together like a machine, similar to the end of the song \\"Deliverance\\" from albums past.    After that epic, we get \\"Hours of Wealth.\\" The first half is a build up of clean guitars, piano and synthesizers. Then everything stops and Akerfeldt gives his most expressive singing to date over sparse piano chords, followed by a tranquil blues solo. If you start to tear up, it's best to take a break before moving on. Otherwise, \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" will rip you to pieces.    It starts off with an irregular riff before moving into a dramatic sequence of variations on a single theme. It goes into a quiet, evil-sounding interlude before erupting in death growls and a flurry of aggressive rhythm work from nearly every member of the band. The song moves between the two moods for about ten minutes, but there's enough change to keep it interesting. At about the six minute mark, Akerfeldt screams \\"The grand conjuration\\" during one of the heaviest moments in Opeth history. It can literally make your head explode.    This song is the basis for the band's first video. Unfortunately, it's creepy, confusing and half as long as the full song. You're better off listening to the album version and making up your own \\"video\\" using your imagination.    The final song is \\"Isolation Years,\\" another subdued song. It deals with the separation of two lovers. It's a simple and beautiful song that is a good way to regain your composure after the mayhem of the preceding track.    There you have it. This quick summary of \\"Ghost Reveries\\" does the album no justice. You're better off using the review as a guide, since any progressive fan or metal head should definitely add this to his or her library. It'll hopefully influence some modern bands to evolve their sound somewhat. This was the band's first test as a mass-marketed (relatively speaking) metal group in America, and they pass with flying colors while losing none of their edge.    Opeth are here to stay.
B000069HJI|5.0|Depois de ouvir muito esse álbum em vinil, adquiri, recentemente o CD lançado aqui no Brasil, acreditando tratar-se de versão atual, pois a versão remasterizada fora lançada em 2002. Insatisfeito com a qualidade do CD brasileiro, resolvi adquirir essa versão \\"REMASTERED\\", e ela é simplesmente FANTÁSTICA, infinitamente superior, deliciosa de se ouvir.

B000BYA5GO|4.0|\\"Lord of War\\" follows the story of a young immigrant who becomes a dealer in a shady business, rises to the top and eventually faces tragedy and loss. Sound Familiar?    Comparisons to \\"Scarface,\\" in which a Cuban immigrant gains prominence as a drug lord, are not far off the mark. \\"Traffic\\" is another obvious influence. \\"Lord of War\\" also takes us deep into a business where money takes precedence over morals.     Nicolas Cage is Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian immigrant raised in Brooklyn. After witnessing a shooting, he decides that guns are his calling. With help from his troubled brother, Vitaly (excellently played by Jared Leto), he eventually surpasses international arms dealers who shrugged him off as an \\"amateur\\" only years before. He puts it best when he says, \\"I sold to every army but the Salvation Army.\\"    Cage's performance is great and drives home the fact that Yuri is just a man doing his job, and what his buyers do with his product is none of his business. He's collected and professional on the outside, but it seems that he knows what he's doing is immoral. He basically ignores that thought and continues fulfilling his purpose, although he witness events that can only occur because of people like him, such as village massacres in Africa and the use of child soldiers (since an AK-47 is so easy to use that a child can handle it).     Cage portrays a man who enjoys what he does, even if he is full of inner turbulence because of his occupation. He grows weary by the end of the 20 year period in which the movie is set, yet he's come too far to stop. Pleas from his trophy wife, Ava (Bridget Maynahan), and Vitaly do no good in the long run. Yuri becomes a lost cause, and an arrogant one at that. It's necessary to go into such detail about Yuri, since he's such a complex and charismatic character who carries the film along much of the time.    The movie is rather dark, with humor that may cause a nervous chuckle instead of uncontrollable laugher. It's more of a satire than a comedy, as some people seem to label it. Rebellions are seen as business opportunities while peace agreements are viewed as obstacles. Yuri cheers and kisses Mikhail Gorbachev's head on his television at the fall of the Berlin Wall, which opened the floodgates in the Third World black arms market. Interpol officer Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) catches Yuri transporting his merchandise several times, but no one is arrested because of a loophole, technicality or obvious cover up. The U.S. president is called the biggest arms dealer of them all and potshots are taken at democracy. This list goes on.    \\"Lord of War\\" paints a bleak and cynical view of the world. Yuri sums up the theme of the movie when he says, \\"They say evil prevails when good men fail to act. What they ought to say is that evil prevails.\\"    There are times when the movie falters. It takes awhile to really get going and sometimes the characters seem a little too upbeat, given their circumstances. Despite any minor shortcomings, the movie is still intriguing, entertaining, thought-provoking, moving, and borderline brilliant at times. The strong performances and plot, plus a unique style, make \\"Lord of War\\" one of the better movies of 2005.    Highly recommended.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Being a fan of Stephen King, I had read \\"The Mist\\", his novella, some years back and enjoyed it.  The sense of terror and what can happen to people's psychological states when trapped and desperately seeking escape and reason came across very well.    I was excited to hear of a film adaptation, then was intrigued when I heard of a shocker of an ending that differed from King's novella.  So I took a chance and bought it.    First of all, this is a combination science fiction/horror film, but with emphasis not so much on the monsters (which are very send \\"chills down the spine type\\" of monsters, especially the smaller buzzing, stinging, acid-web shooting ones).  Rather, the director chooses to explore the depths to which people can change given desperate situations.      Starting out simply enough,(warning-some spoilers here) a freak thunderstorm brings then a mist which traps a group of people in a supermarket.  I found this very effective with the town siren going off, police cars racing by, and the first victim to get away running into the store claiming \\"there's something in the mist!\\"    What then follows is a character study of how people react. This is to me the horror element. Thomas Jane, in my opinion a good and too often overlooked gifted actor, does very well in his role as the artist trying to get others to understand the seriousness of the situation, but more importantly, as a devoted father determined to protect his son at whatever cost.  Marcia Gay Harden (bless her heart, that role had to have drained her emotionally) soars into orbit with her almost campy, over the top role as the religious individual who turns her beliefs into more irrational and insane thought patterns and tries (and succeeds) in bringing many others wanting answers to her side.      Others on the good and \\"bad\\" side do well in their roles, but I do agree with what one critic said-that is the waste of actor Andre Baugher.  The fact he was a stubborn lawyer was one thing, but to believe others in the store were playing a joke on him when told there was blood and a remaining part of one of the monsters in the store room, even when the store manager also went back and saw it and came back and reiterated the truth-that was dissapointing.  Baugher's early demise in the film was also a dissapointment, whereas the film would have been more effective and involving with him working with Jane's character and coming to believe something in fact WAS out there in the mist. He would have been an asset to the closing sequence with his own stubborn beliefs being challenged through.    It is true, the monsters and creatures don't make numerous appearances, but when they do, I was riveted, especially (spoiler) when the store window broke and they started getting in.  Yikes.  The pharmacy scene too with creatures of a different type was creepy.    The ending is really the most powerful factor on how one looks at this film. I see the view point in that it is one of the darkest, most depressing, bleakest, all hope is gone type of movie endings I've seen.  Wow.  That's all I can say. In all honesty, I read other reviews here to find the ending and I'm glad I did, or I might have been more upset.  We go to the movies to see sometimes scary movies and we're used to the \\"oh, the monster isn't dead after all\\" or ending like that.  The director here takes an entirely different approach and wow, it packs a wallop.  It is unsettling and shocking.    In defense, though, the ending does portray sacrifice (how far would we go to spare a loved one from possible suffering-it's about a father's love for his son) and it also portrays a sense of reality in that life doesn't always have happy endings and what cruel twists of fate there can be.  Many reviewers have stated Jane's character never would have done that.  In all honesty, how do we really know?  How would we truly react if something bizarre like that happened and a loved one was at risk at any moment?  It's a sobering concept!!    I credit the director, actors, and special effects wizards behind this movie in that if you look at it as a straight monster-science fiction/horror movie (monsters both creature and some human!), it does work.  If it doesn't for you, turn off the movie when the few that escape drive off into the mist and leave it at that....     Sincerely,  William
B00005QG9J|4.0|\\"Morningview\\" is an album that is perfect to listen to while watching the sun go down on a beautiful beach during the summer. It's very mellow, and even catchier than \\"Make Yourself.\\" Most of the album is carried along by the vocals with the instruments becoming a little more subdued and relaxed.     It's built on atmosphere and keeping a calm vibe, and it's basically a world apart from the unrestrained funk metal of \\"Fungus Amongus.\\" There are still some heavier songs such as \\"Nice to Know You,\\" \\"Circles\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" but the best parts of the album are the quieter tunes like \\"Mexico,\\" \\"Echo,\\" \\"11am\\" and \\"Aqueous Transmission.\\" The latter three are great songs to play while driving around with a significant other, or to settle down after a long day. There isn't a weak track here.
0689877692|5.0|This is such a beautiful book. I recommend everyone to add a copy of this book to their library. I picked up this book in the classroom I work in to engage a 3 year old child with autism. She didn't take her eyes off this book and wanted to play with it again and again. I am now getting one for my three year old son. Every child and adult will love this book. It is truly amazing. Never have I seen such wonderful pop up art done.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" is one of those films whose success depends entirely on the performances of the actors. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are brought in to portray two icons in the world of music whose personal lives are just as fascinating as their work on stage. Fortunately, they succeed on every level, just as Russell Crowe (Phoenix's rival from 2000's \\"Gladiator\\") and Renee Zellweger did in the character-driven \\"Cinderella Man\\" earlier that year.    The music of the late Johnny Cash (Phoenix) is timeless, and so is his story. He comes from a working-class southern family, joins the Air Force and becomes a terrible salesman. His ambition was music, and he pursued it despite objections from his family and his wife. He succeeds and becomes a nationwide phenomenon, touring with the likes of Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis when they first started out. The movie covers the highs and the unbelievable lows.    The bulk of the film is set in the time period from 1954-1965. It focuses on Cash's rise to prominence and his pursuit of the love of his life, singer/entertainer June Carter (Witherspoon), even if he was already married with children. Phoenix shows Cash as a talented but troubled man, while Witherspoon delivers a duel performance, one as a sassy June Carter when she's on stage and a compassionate one everywhere else. They work together stunningly, and the rest of the cast is great as well.    The love story becomes the main focus of the film, which would be a disappointment if it wasn't for the chemistry and brilliant performances of the two. Unfortunately, the second half of Cash's life is summed up in a paragraph at the end of the movie, which doesn't do the man justice. Someone stated that it's the only musical biopic that deserves a sequel, and that person is right on the money.    Regardless, the pacing of the film and the development of the characters is excellent. Even if you've never heard of Johnny Cash before he released his cover of Nine Inch Nails' \\"Hurt\\" a few years back, it's really captivating. Even the performances of some of his greatest hits can appeal to anyone, from the indie rock aficionado to the death metalhead. Phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing, with incredibly impressive results.    As stated before, the main focus of the film becomes the love story. It's a rather unique and alluring one, spanning many years and tons peaks and valleys. It shows both the positive and destructive aspects of love, and you watch the effect of the relationship on Cash and Carter. Too bad the end of the love story is the end of the film.    \\"Walk The Line\\" is a great movie. The story is full of bliss and tragedy and really makes you appreciate the work of Johnny Cash. It may be a little too serious for some people, but it's still a splendid film that anyone can enjoy.
B0006BD9EC|5.0|This book is an incredible read and has completely changed how I look at life.  Everything's a negotiation, right?  It makes complete and total sense; from convincing yourself to wake up each morning, debating whether or not to have that dessert with lunch; life all about little negotiations and getting that \\"yes\\" we want out of any given situation.  After reading this book, I see all those little negotiations life has to offer so clearly now, it's like they're starring me in the face; and what's better, I know how to tackle them now and get exactly what I want, I know how to get that \\"yes\\".   I've already started using these negotiating techniques; everything from me and my wife deciding what we're going to watch, to how we eat.  And you know what, we decided to eat better, because we both decided that a healthy body was the yes we wanted in the long run; and in our own little negotiation, we figured out how to make that happen. I've recommended this book to all of my friends; every single one of them loved it.
0451196716|4.0|I think King's greatest gift as a writer is that he often comes across as a good buddy telling you a wild story.  The Long Walk is a perfect example of this.  He excels at the detail level of character carmaraderie which pulls you into the story regardless of where it is headed.  Here, it seems pretty clear, but we still don't want to stop listening.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I read the John Adams book by David McCullough first.  I enjoyed the book very much and was eager to see how it translated to television.  I have really enjoyed the way the mini-series has been able to capture the book.  The series and the book helps me to realize how amazing our founding fathers were and how they were all such visionaries.  Every American should either see the series or read the book to either re-capture their sense of patriotism, or experience it for the first time.  Our forefathers and their families made many sacrifices for us to be able to live in the United States.  We should never forget how fortunate we all are to be born in this country.

B000ZN802W|5.0|Who are you? (who,who? who, who?)<br />It seems the hero of this beautiful and sad film did not get the chance to find out, nature killed him before he made it.<br />Don't blame nature alone, the man clearly had a death wish and provoked the danger that beat him in the end.<br />A young man from a well to do but not entirely harmonious family decides to drop out and become a hippy, a tramp, a hobo, a hermit. He hates society but finds friends wherever he goes. Well, apart from Alaska. He hates the concept of 'people', but people seem to love him and hate to lose him. In other words, he is one heck of a selfish monster, this nice guy.<br />He calls himself Alexander Supertramp and even makes a half-hearted and obviously brainless effort at getting new ID papers with that name. Purpose is to make himself unfindable to his folks. He ends up as an Alaskan hermit in an abandoned old bus wreck.<br />His mind is formed by Thoreau, Jack London, Tolstoy. The time is early 90s. I have not read the book, which was a 'non-fiction bestseller', so I would not know if the movie could have been better. As it is, I liked it a lot.
076780421X|5.0|On the surface this looks like just another superficial formulatic Hollywood movie, and while that is true, Matthew Perry and Salma Hyek really make it work well.  This movie rises above all expectations.  When she finds herself pregnancy after a one-night stand, and they decide to be together despite the odds, they have so many issues to overcome.  Perry is from New York and Hyek makes her home in Nevada.  He is Presbyterian and she is Catholic.  Not to mention the many cultural differences.  They have terrific chemistry, and wonderful on screen presence together.  Wonderful movie.

B0002WZTOI|5.0|This is probably the best film every made about the navy.  Navy pilots were brought to the forefront and characterized in this highly popular movie.  There was a lot of dramatic license taken because a lot of scenes were far from being factual.  That does not in any way take anything away from the enjoyment because it is highly entertaining and suspenseful.  The soundtrack from this film is phenomenal, and is also a must buy.  It is one you will never tire of watching time and time again.

B00004YA66|5.0|Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel are so good in this movie.  They play father and son able to communicate via an old ham radio even though his father passed away some thirty years ago.  The explanation for this is due to unusual auroral activity and the effect it has on electronics.  They discover they have the ability to change history by sharing information when John tells Frank how he died in the line of duty, so many years ago.  They work together to stop a serial killer that was never caught, and that now threatens their family in both the past and present.  Very on the edge of your seat suspenseful, and entertaining!
B00133KFGW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater at Thanksgiving with my cousins and we all really enjoyed it. A wonderful story of three people trying to find one another and the music that brings them together. I bought the soundtrack on iTunes the day after I saw the movie and I've already listened to it dozens of times. I bought the movie the week it came out on DVD and we've already seen it a couple of times. Thanks for the entertainment...
B000WQWPJQ|4.0|Tom Hanks in this movie is the best when he is by himself on the island. His acting range is great for this role. I compare it to Saving Private Ryan, Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. Picture/Audio quality are just above average on blu-ray. Worth a buy because of him.

That is, I don't have a single feeling about it but many.  Taking everything into account (acting, dialogue, cinematography), it's quite good as a film.  The story left me dismayed and disturbed.  The man behind the story, Chris McCandless, in my view, was more flawed than hero.  Some may see his adventures and his views on life as romantic or noble.  I found him to be naive, selfish, immature and ignorant of the power of nature.  The things he saw, though, must have been incredible.  In the two years in which all the action takes place, \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" lived two or three lifetimes, putting into action the old rock n' roll cliche, \\"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\\"

B0013D8LOK|4.0|Sweeney Todd is one of my favorite musicals and, after Porgy and Bess, my second-favorite American opera.  I've seen a production at New York City Opera, plus filmed versions of the stage production with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn and the concert version with Hearn and Patti Lupone.  Unfortunately, I waited too long and missed the film version on the big screen, but now I've seen the Tim Burton movie on computer.<br /><br />The film creates a dark, brooding mood, without the boisterousness of the stage versions.  Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, as Sweeney Todd and Nellie Lovett, deliver subdued performances, looking like a pair of demonized grown-up orphans.  Their \\"A Little Priest\\" is hilarious.  They lack the rounded voices of their stage predecessors, but their more everyday vocals fit the mood of this version.<br /><br />Alan Rickman's Judge Turpin is more of a frustrated lover than the more obvious tyrant of the stage.  Timothy Spall's Beadle Bamford, Turpin's engratiating toady, is less the nobleman and more the \\"rat\\"--appropriate for the guy who played Peter Pettigrew in the Harry Potter films.  Johanna is pretty but underused, and Anthony looks more like a 1970s rock star than an 1840's sailor.  The pivotal role of the Beggar Woman also appears not often enough.<br /><br />One surprise is the casting of a preteen male alto, Ed Sanders, as the orphan boy Toby.  Usually played on stage as an adolescent tenor with a somewhat addled brain, the film's Toby comes across as just a normal young boy caught up in some tenuous circumstances.  Considering the mother-son relationship that develops between Mrs. Lovett and Toby, perhaps in the more intimate film version, a younger boy is a better choice.<br /><br />Much of the music is gutted; we don't hear \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\\" (except as an instrumental), \\"Kiss Me\\", \\"Parlor Songs\\", and only half of \\"God, That's Good\\".  Quite a few remaining songs are pared down.  I don't think we get to hear the chorus sing once!  With such drastic cuts in music, the operatic quality is lost.<br /><br />Still, taken on its own merits, the film Sweeney Todd is still a gripping, engrossing story, enhanced by the music of Stephen Sondheim.  I'm sure it will be worth seeing more than once.cuts in music, the operatic quality is lost.

Please those of us who have children or grandchildren or anyone who says they are bored, get them to watch this, it should be a mandate in every household and school.
006135323X|3.0|I am just starting the book. Chapter one is ok. Good approach to what the author names relativity. Some irrationality is hidden in this decision mechanism and can be exploited by a clever guy.   In chapter two, the author presents the concept of anchor and an example to demonstrate how an initial and sometimes irrational information can influence future decisions. I think the concept of anchor, as presented by the author, is limited, its use is rational and the experiment is apparently misinterpreted.   Some products are very difficult to valuate. Gems are a classical example. It is not possible for a median consumer to estimate the value of a gem. The black pearl dealer was very smart in associating it to expensive products. For such products, suggested prices work very well. The sounds used by the author in his experiment are a fantastic example of a difficult-to-valuate product. The author used two groups of participants. All participants heard the same annoying sound. The first group was asked whether they accepted to hear again the sound for 10 cents (first anchor for this group). The second group had 90 cents as the anchor. Each participant had to say yes or no. The author did not report the result. It is easy to accept that the participants would adopt the suggested values as the prices of such exotic products. Then both groups were asked to bid how much they would accept for hearing again the sound. The first group (10cents anchor) offered in average 33 cents. The second group (90 cents anchor) offered 73 cents. It demonstrates that both groups accepted the anchors. Those of each group who bid the lowest values won the auction. With this, they learned that they had to offer low bids. But what is a low bid? This depends on the reference value they have for the product.  A second round of the experiment was run. The author played a second annoying sound to both groups and asked whether they accepted to hear it again for 50 cents (second anchor - the same for all). The participants had to say yes or no. The author did not mention the result. I guess that the first group accepted better than the second one because this was a better offer than the first one. The second group had a worse offer. This would be a rational decision. Then both groups were asked to bid how much they would accept for hearing again the second sound. The result was that the first group bade less than the second one, but the values were not mentioned. The author concluded that the first anchor had surpassed the second one. This would be a proof that initial information could influence future decisions even if they are not rational.   I think this conclusion is too much simple. In my opinion, the groups could have behaved very rationally. This depends on the hidden information. That is why I said that this experiment was apparently misinterpreted. I think the participants can hold or change the anchors as many times as they see an advantage in it. I think that the first group accepted much better the 50 cents anchor than the second group, because this was an advantage for this group and a disadvantage for the second group. But the first group held the old 10 cents anchor when they bid for the second auction because they learned that to win they had to bid low, and this group had a very low reference value, while the second group had not. I guess that the second group bade less than the 73 cents of the first auction. This would indicate that part of this group accepted the second anchor and used it to make the second bid because it was the lowest reference they had. The experiment had a third round that is just a repetition of the second one. The results confirmed those ones of the second round.   In conclusion, I think that anchors are accepted irrationally only if it is difficult for the person to valuate the product. The anchors can held or change for future decisions only if this brings advantage. This is a very rational behavior.  The authors did not mention an interesting result. Although the price of sounds is very difficult to estimate, the participants developed a mechanism for doing so. In the first auction, the first group bade in average 33 cents, higher than the first anchor. The second group bade 75 cents, lower than the first anchor. Thus, the groups developed a way to estimate value, even though based on initial anchors.
B000NA1XSA|5.0|This book by Geoff Emerick, the Beatles' recording engineer for most of their career is one of the best I've read about this seminal group. His behind the scene look at how they created their audio magic with inventive, innovative, daring techniques never tried before by anyone, is absolutely fascinating. Even if you aren't a musician or recordist, but sinmply a Beatles fan or fan of rock music, these insight and perspectives are totally unique. Anyone can write a book, but to have actually been there day in and day out and participated in making \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", \\"Abbey Road\\", etc. gives Mr. Emerick a huge advantage of being interesting than a casual researcher or biographer. Reading this book made me run to my record collection to relisten and reexamine this music anew. It is some of the most groundbreaking in all of pop history and very few have reached these heights since. The alternative view offered of the various personalities, working styles and musical roles of each Beatle also shed some new light not offered in other books on the Fab Four. This book was released with much ado, but it doesn;t disappoint and is even better than I expected. I recommend it with the highest enthusiasm.
B000H0MKOC|3.0|I found Thank You For Smoking funny, clever, interesting, and  generally entertaining.  But I'd rather talk about what I didn't like  about it.    One might think, from some of the publicity, that the film is a  satiric sermon against the ability of lobbyists for big business to  spin public opinion however they want.  In fact, the movie, based on a  novel by former Bush I speechwriter Christopher Buckley, is something  of a tribute to the unsung work of the lobbyists.    The hero is Nick Naylor, hired gun for the tobacco industry.  We see  him plotting to reglamorize cigarettes in movies, boasting to his  friends about how many people cigarettes kill, brow-beating a little  girl about smoking, etc.  Some reviewers have taken these to be signs  of a liberal agenda against big tobacco or big business, but the whole  logic of the movie works the other way.  This is all part of Nick's  job, and his job isn't so bad because really Nick is a good guy.    How do we know he's a good guy?  Well, first of all, he has a nice,  friendly smile.  The actor (Aaron Eckhart) even mentioned (on the  Charlie Rose show) that the director kept telling him to smile more.  Naylor has two close lobbyist friends who stick with him even after he  nearly destroys their careers through his own carelessness.  He smiles  because he enjoys his job and he is so good at it.  He is also a great  dad, struggling to stay connected to his son.  And you immediately see  that his curmugeonly old boss down in North Carolina is a good guy too  despite his stream of amoral rhetoric.    These nice industry flacks contrast with the sad liberals around them.  Naylor's uptight ex-wife tries to keep him from his son.  A nasty,  sanctimonious congressman and the congressman's fawning, whining aid  keep losing debates with Naylor.  There is even some Hispanic guy who  testifies in favor of skull-and-crossbones labels on cigarettes  because written warnings discriminate against people who can't read  English.  Haha, political correctness is everywhere, next thing you  know some bleeding heart will claim tobacco companies are targetting  poorer and less educated people...    Naylor even gets to earnestly lecture his son on how it's an essential  part of our freedom as Americans to have lobbyists defend cigarettes  (and by extension, environmental destruction, animal cruelty, and any  other nasty things that make money).    How much you swallow Naylor's argument on his own behalf depends on  your politics.  If you think that big business in the United States is  too restrained by government regulation, I guess Naylor can be your  hero.  If you're more worried about, say lead poisoning from  underinspected toys or mistreatment of low wage workers or bad air  quality from coal plants, then your sympathy for tobacco lobbyists and  the like may be somewhat more limited.    In either case, it's nice to be aware of the point of view a movie is  selling.  This movie inserts a pro-greed point of view so subtly and  persuasively that it would surely make Nick Naylor himself proud.
0385522401|5.0|Yes, I'm already a fan, but his writing in this book is so spare, so delicate, that it is even more powerful than Atonement. And for someone who remembers these times as I do, as described by McEwan, it is also a clear reflection of this strange period of transition from post-war to the sixties that were just arriving with all their baggage. Great writing.
1596912855|5.0|I love Jane Austen stuff, the books, the movies, and am a huge fan of the BBC Pride and Prejudice series that starred Collin Firth.  This book is so much fun and you can relate to our main character Jayne and her journey.  What fun!  Well worth the expense to own the book, well worth your time reading it.  You'll smile and find it delightful.
B001041JKU|5.0|I enjoyed all the original tracks as for the updates/duets I didn't care for them but that is me. I have the original album and cassette so now I have the remastered CD and video of Thriller and love it. A great memory from when I was in high school.
0452289963|5.0|Good book by Tolle. Read it following along with Oprah's online/tv class. Thought it was a good read and a positive way to practice staying in the 'here and now'. I still find myself noticing 'my ego' getting in the way of myself after reading Tolle's description of ego vs. self. I never finished the last couple chapters but do plan to one of these days!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I thought this was a noce addition to a variety of collections I have and I love a few of the songs here. Not all of them but the Long and Winding Road and Let It Be are two of my favs and it was interesting to hear them this way as they are all different from the released songs from back in the 60's to 1970. Just such great writers they were and Paul still is.
B00000J6AG|5.0|In an era dominated by Grunge and Hip-hop, Moby managed to create an album which will arguably be placed on the best list of the 90's. He introduced the Blues to Electronica and made it commercially trendy.
B000056BOR|5.0|Doris Day made some many wonderfully fun films and I recall as a child watching these filsm and enjoying them just as I do today. These aren't suppose to be acclaimed films either, they are simple and fun stories.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Usually when you're looking through reviews online there are so many mixed messages and you're wondering who to actually listen to. (Well at least that's how I am.) Maybe this will help some.. This is an absolutely amazing CD, every song is great, a little different from the one before it but they flow nicely together. (Not one of those cds were u wish you'd just downloaded two songs and skipped the actual purchase itself.) I think the only people who felt negatively toward this album were those that didn't understand that the Apologize Remix they may have heard on the radio is not what this CD mainly consists of.      I have this cd on in my car all of the time and everytime someone new is in my car they ask \\"Who is this... they're really good!\\" and then they're surprised when they hear One Republic's CD is so different from the Timbaland Remix (Don't get me wrong I love that song as well, the CD is just a little more chill.) Lots of my friends have gone out and bought the cd after hearing it in my car and they've all been glad they bought it too.
6304143184|5.0|I was nine years old when I first this movie and it was great seeing again after 25 years.<br />The classic mega sci-fi hit about the lonely 10 year old boy who finds and befriends a gentle alien, is as wonderful as the classic ever was.<br />Elliot (Henry Thomas) stumbles across the alien who soon names himself ET, and soon his oldere brother Michael (Robert Macnaughton)  and his absolutely adorable 7 year old mischeivous sister Gertie (played by a vey young Drew Barrymore in her heartstealing debut performance).<br /><br />Some very memorable  secenes include the part where Gertie teaches ET to talk, where the kid's mother (Dee Wallace)  opens Elliot's cupboard and passes ET off as one of his toys, the tearjerking scenes of ET dying in the scientists medical facility, and of course the psychical connection of ET and Elliot, leading Elliot to experience the symptoms of being drunk in science class when ET is drinking the beer at home.

B0010ZR160|3.0|This movie is a mixed bag for me -- hence the three-star rating.  Specifically ...    Pro's    * Strong cast that includes heavyweights like Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and Amy Madigan  * Powerful cinematography portraying the grittiness of Dorchester and the human \\"characters\\" who populate this working class world    Con's    * Casey Affleck and his hot girlfriend (Monaghan) seem just too pretty and callow for us to believe they possess the \\"street cred\\" that we're supposed to think they have  * The plot has more twists than an origami sculpture and can be a bit demanding on and confusing to viewers to take it all in in real time and follow what's going on    Interesting!  A close call between a three- or four-star rating.

B000001GQB|5.0|Pardon my self-indulgence here, but I bought the vinyl of 40 & 41 in 1973 when I was in college.  I \\"knew\\" classical music from piano lessons through most of grade school, but with this recording, plus Vivaldi and \\"Clockwork Orange,\\" I had just started truly discovering it, psychedelically enhanced.      To this day, for me, nothing in the entire classical repertoire compares to the 41st.      I have listened to many other recordings of the 41st since, and seen it performed several times.  A classical music mentor of mine shamed me for owning Bohm's in the early 80s, and now, reading all the reviews here, I can see both his point, and why my soul cannot let go of Bohm's.      Bohm, relatively speaking, is heavy, ponderous, grandiose, weighty -- and so less accurate perhaps.  This is not a flaw though per se.  Bohm grew up in the Romantic tradition, and is grounded in the perspective of that time in history.  He does not Romanticize Mozart, rather, he feels Mozart as a Romantic.  What Mozart in his last symphonies has to say to us, who are in part Romantics, is sublime.    You owe it to yourself to hear what Bohm hears and conveys, to allow yourself to be touched this deeply.  No other conductor I have ever heard achieves this.  If you allow yourself only a historically accurate interpretation, you will miss out on how Mozart touches us deeper with the passage of centuries.  Discover new places in your soul and let the tears flow.    On the vinyl, at the end of the 41st, very faintly but clearly, if you listen with headphones, you hear maniacal happy laughter.  I wonder if it has survived the years, and if anyone has heard it or can explain it.
B000A2IPP0|4.0|E.T. is the warmest story of Sci Fi since The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). This amazing story of a 10-years-old boy (Thomas) who meets a creature of other planet. The film shows love, warmth, friendship and courage in a Sci Fi movie which calls the attention and likes both of children and adults. The sound and the visual effects are excellent. And the audience really learn to love ET through the sensibility of this extra-terrestrial.                       Apart from Henry Thomas, all the cast of the young children are superb, specially Drew Barrymore and Robert MacNaughton. The end is terrific. Great creation and direction of Steven Spielberg.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Wow.  I just bought this.  This is Depeche Mode's best work since Violator, IMHO.  No weak tracks.    The first few seconds of the first song (A Pain that I'm used to) are rather annoying, but it winds up being a very good track.  Precious, Macro, Nothing's Impossible, and Lilian are my favorite songs, but they're all quite good.  I'd like to give this 4.5 stars, but since that isn't an option here, I'll be generous and round up to 5, mainly because there aren't any bad songs on this CD.    This seems to me a mix between their 80's electronic sound and their more recent darker music.  I think that most Depeche Mode fans will enjoy this album.
B000AA4IJE|5.0|There are very few albums I would recommend as completely as this one. Satire, humour, creativity and dead on musicianship simmer up this rich cultural stew of the late 1960s. Great basic rock informed by a deep and practiced knowledge of jam jazz underlay lyrics that are witty, satirical and antisocial. A healthy antidote to both social conformity, and naive idealism, you can put this one up on a shelf with the likes of Gene Cruppa, Spike Jones, Tex Avery & Walter Lantz, Jackson Pollock and Hunter S. Thompson. If I could give ten stars I would.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|It was terrific. A good heart felt movie about discovering oneself in a seemingly hopeless situation. My two brothers and I plan on going on a cross country road trip this summer because of this movie. Its also very funny.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This cd is fabulous. It is rare to purchase a cd and like every song on it. This one is just that good, and I was never a John Mayer fan before. I didn't hear his music until the radio played Change the World so much that I asked someone who is this? I am a new fan. The lyrics are brilliant.  Stephanie in Virginia
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I've only seen the first four of the series so far. I'm an average viewer, not a critic who receives advanced screenings, so I don't feel obligated to pick a movie apart and force myself to either hate it or love it. Believe me, being overly critical can make a simple and beautiful movie look awful, and a bland movie look like a masterpiece. Seeing as the vast majority of those who will be watching this are, as myself, average viewers seeking a good entertaining and heartfelt movie, not someone who dislikes it because it disagrees with their 'liberal arts' education, then this review is for them. Besides, the success of this film lies in the hands of the average viewer (the majority).<br /><br />The first thing that struck me was the acting. There are parts were I was thinking to myself, \\"Man, Mr Adams just politically slapped everyone and did it with style.\\"  It made me feel good, all warm and fuzzy inside :-) I wanted to stomp a staff on the floor in agreement with Mr. Adams, and boo the opposition off the floor.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was how authentic the people look.  It scares me and makes me grateful I don't have to live in that time.  The common-folk appear to be rather grungy and I could imagine quite smelly.  Some seem malnourished or just plain unhealthy.<br /><br />What I like most is that this series is able to capture some of the most significant events in American history and leave me with that warm fuzzy feeling as the events unfold.<br /><br />One thing that I don't like, but at the same time it's okay, is that it doesn't capture how vast of an area this covered. Each scene seemed rather staged and enclosed.  But I say that's \\"okay\\" because I believe by putting it in more of a staged setting it helps tell the historical story a bit more efficiently that way.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|If you've seen any part of Season 9 or 10 of Stargate, then you need to see this.  If you haven't seen any part of Season 9 or 10, you need to get those DVD's and THEN you need to see this.  It takes all the action and drama and heroism that made the show great, and takes it to a grander scale.  The orchestral score, the sweeping panoramas, and the harrowing fight to the finish make it a fitting conclusion to the show's biggest story arc.  The only thing marring it is the resurrection of a thrice-eradicated nemesis, but it lives up to the challenge of concluding the greatest sci-fi show since Star Trek.
0425068013|4.0|An Agatha Christie courtroom drama - this is the first book of hers I've read that takes place mainly in a courtroom.  And there is NOT the usual dramatic scene where Poirot speaks to all the suspects and reveals the killer.  That was a surprise.  This is one of my favorites so far.  Poirot is his usual self.  There is a damsel in distress of course.  But the plot has dramatic twists and complexities.  I did have a hunch as to who the killer was, but did not know how or why.  The love story is more developed than in other works, which I liked.  The depth and complexity made me enjoy the story more and I could not put it down.
159102594X|5.0|Praise is far too meager a word, much too weak a definition, for my thoughts on this novel.  Joe Abercrombie has crafted a story that at once feels eerily familiar yet deftly rushes your mind with images vivid and brutish so as to make the next page come ever too slowly.  The characters of this fiction are not the honest, touching, celebrated heroes of stories told; these are the characters who should inhabit dire times and commit dark deeds.  Mr. Abercrombie has siezed upon his characters to present his awe-struck readers with a much more insightful view of the realms of fantasy fiction.  It is quite an honor to read a refreshing tale, wherein the characters are brutally adult in this words and actions, and the world itself is at once beautiful and horrifying.      Readers are truly gifted to receive such a well-made story; I cannot give enough praise for this work, but I can say 'The Blade Itself' is one of the finest novels to find its way into my hands since I first sat down with R. A. Salvatore's masterpiece trilogy.
0739334085|5.0|I purchased the audio version of this book to listen to during my commute to work. But, I had no idea what a treat this experience was going to be for me. When I begun listing to \\"Audacity of Hope\\" I did not want to get out of my car! What a pleasant experience it was to listen to this book. Barack Obama deserved the awards he received for reading this book. But, more than that, it was the great language and the fantastic message which captivated me the entire time. A pure joy! Thank you senator.
B000ZN8036|5.0|The movie tells me that getting an educational degree or a driving license isn't enough to serve as a rite of passage to real life where you feel being more than a product of your nearest environment, composed by your family and its history or your schooling and the relationships you experience within or around your school life.    Definitely Shawn Penn is a great director and Emile Hirsch who plays Chris McCandless is just captivating.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|As a long time Jane Austen fan, I bought this thinking it couldn't be as bad as some of the reviews suggest. Boy, was I wrong.    I don't know what the producers could have been thinking. They turned Anne into a weepy dishrag! And their Captain Wentworth may look nice but he doesn't look like a sailor. He looks more like a rich landowner's son who never had to do a day's hard labor in his life. He would have made a good Mr. Elliot actually. The rest of the character's in the story have been similarly skewed. And I was horrified by the changes that were made to the plot. They actually took out the most romantic scene in the whole story!    If you want to see the real story of [[ASIN:B00003JRCQ Persuasion]], please get the 1995 version starring Amanda Root. It is a far superior adaptation in every way. Don't bother with this travesty.
B00005JPLW|4.0|Taken for what it is, 300 is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment.  Masterpiece Theatre it's not, but that isn't the point.  Fantastic special effects, good acting, decent plot, and gory battle scenes make this a winner!!
0743554434|4.0|This was a well written story about sad facts of life in that region of the word. These are facts that most of us would rather not even know about, let alone live them! I am an artist and not a critique. So, the best way I can express myself is to say that this book was similar to an impressionistic painting to me...although every painful detail was not presented, enough was said to provide the complete picture to me. Well done!
0307237702|5.0|Obama has written a highly intelligent and very informed book.  It ranges very widely and shows both his varied background and his erudition.  A fine book by a very intelligent young man.
B000YABYLA|4.0|There's a lot of crappy teen movies out there- this is not one of them. In fact it's one of the great teen movies like the breakfast club and ferris bueler's day off. (And adults will definatly like it, too.) You know what's funny? Nobody ever pegs The Breakfast Club or Ferris Bueler as being \\"unrealistic\\". But that's what's happening with Juno. Juno is a movie. It is a MOVIE. Not a documentary. I think if people can remember that they can enjoy the movie for what it is.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|While reading the low-star reviews about this movie here on Amazon and wondering why there is such an outburst of hatred, I had a revelation:  people who cannot open up their minds and actually view something objectively instead of forcing their two-bit, old-fashioned opinions on the rest of us will jump at the chance to spout off negative viewpoints at any opportunity.    \\"Juno\\" is a fantastic movie - it is well-written, surprisingly realistic, and despite what many have said:  ORIGINAL.  Whether people want to believe it or not, teen pregnancy is an issue in America today, and it will not be going away anytime soon.  Does \\"Juno\\" condone this behavior?  No.  Rather, it presents the events in an edgy way that seems to be too confrontational to all of the nun-types that overpopulate the Amazon reviews.  The people who despise this movie so much all appear to have the same thing in common, and that is their ability to become appalled at the idea of an unwed teen taking on the responsibility of facing her mistake and deciding what is best for her unborn.  Personally, I feel that the title character handled the situation well and demonstrated more of a sense of responsibility than most real-life teen mothers.  What's the problem here?  \\"Juno\\" is not endorsing unprotected sex, young pregnancy, or child abuse.  The people who hate this movie based on these opinions are more than likely part of the problem in our country; they are  probably the ones who are adamant about promoting abstinence-only sex education in our schools.  Do you know what happens when you ignore the problem of premarital sex and teen sexual activity?  You get pregnant, ignorant teenagers who wouldn't have a clue how to face any of their problems, let alone raise a child effectively.    As for the dialogue, I didn't feel it was anything out of the ordinary that a high school student wouldn't say.  Many found it to be unbelievable and boring, but I found it to be very refreshing.  It was a pleasant change from the usual teen dialogue that consists mostly of \\"yo\\", \\"ya'll\\", \\"omg\\", \\"lol\\", and various strings of over the top obscenities.  There actually are young people out there who talk the way Juno and her friends do - if you don't believe me, read some of the MySpace blogs out there that are written by teens.  It does happen, and much more frequently than you would think.    This movie is undoubtedly not for the overly religious, pious, closed-minded, or self-righteous.  If you are open-minded or you were once an awkward, nerdy teenager that not only felt out of place but completely hated in high school, then you just might enjoy this innovative and heartwarming film.
B0011ZNAIC|1.0|***** THIS WILL HAVE SPOILERS *****  Wow. This was...amazing. I don't know why people love this movie. There was so much wrong with this.  1. Factual errors. Now, someone before me said that it's the FEMALE bees who work, not the MALES as we see in so much abundance here. I don't care if the movie is about animated talking bees, I still expect some amount of realism and facts. Bees sting and don't die, they use machines to get nectar, they have four legs...the list goes on. And they aren't bees--they're miniature humans in bee costumes. If you think about it, it's true. They have cars, jobs, humanoid faces, even Larry King! Later on, Barry talks about coffee. Um...coffee?  2. The storyline. None of the plots or side-plots or whatever are any good. Barry doesn't want a lifelong job, and no one questions this. He leaves the hive, meets a girl, sees humans have been taking their honey and sues the world. It is completely illogical, captain! Why did the court even accept the form? To an outsider it's nonsense. Then everyone accepts talking bees, sides with Barry himself, despite this is something that's been going on for I don't know how long. And apparantly, the WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD sides with the bees. What is the message behind this? Humans are evil for getting food? That's how it makes us out--the beekeepers brag about bees \\"making the honey while we get the money.\\" Barry later says they live off two cups of honey BUT, they have swimming pools. It's like saying you have only a few gallons of water left and demanding a quick shower. And what's with the world dying, eh? And they shot WINNIE-THE-POOH! This and more is just too much belief for me to suspend!  3. Vanessa. This romance plotline between Vanessa the florist and Barry is really unbelievable. He is a BUG falling for a HUMAN, and she's hankerin' for him too! She accepts a talking bee suprisingly fast, making me wonder if the Mosquito hasn't gotten to her, too. Then, many people suggest him and her either makingout or that comment by the lawyer about \\"bed bugs.\\" This is pretty adult stuff for a kid's movie, not to mention weird. Please pardon this comment, but how could a bee make out with a human woman, let alone give her a good time? Seems to me Vanessa's boyfriend is the smartest of the bunch--he's allergic to bees, so he wants to kill it. I would too. Allergies can be serious! Then he finds out it's cheating on his girlfriend. I admit he was a little violent about it, but I would be pretty pissed too if I was him.  All this amounts to a pretty poor movie. The jokes are unfunny, so me and my friend had to amuse ourselves with our own. The animation is fantastic, sure, but that isn't everything. It's biggest flaw lies in it's unforgettability, because it's such an empty movie. It's so forgettable, it doesn't amount to any of the previous bug-centered movies at all, like Bugs Life or even Antz. I don't care if it's Jerry Seinfeld, I don't like him, and frankly, this movie fails on loads of marks. Just skip this stinker and move on.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|This film in its original version is entirely or nearly entirely sung and the music is probably the best part of the film. It is thus a musical tragedy, mind you, not drama.<br /><br />First, Tim Burton recreates in color the bleak black and white vision we can have of London in Dickens’s time among others. Oliver Twist is there in front of us all over again, and his world of coal, smoke and dirt. And the house of this barber is a lot bleaker than any bleak house in Dickens. In fact it goes as deep in squalor as D.H. Lawrence’s early autobiographical novels like Sons and Lovers. The only real color Tim Burton uses is red, the color of blood and nothing else, but all its possible shades and intensities. That is already a piece of art and a masterpiece at that, a film in black, red and grey. Nothing white of course.<br /><br />Second, the actors are so great in their roles and characters that we do believe they are what they pretend to be. Sweeney Todd is really a monster at first look, at first sight, and he will not vary from that identification one single iota. He may be justified in his monstrosity or monster-ness, but he is a monster through and through. And he drags everyone around him into that ugliness. He is only motivated by vengeance and he finds in the pie-maker a perfect accomplice though she would stop at the meat of Sweeney Todd’s victims and may forget about the vengeance itself. But circumstances are never what you can control entirely and Sweeney Todd will have his own vengeance fully and totally, though he made a few mistakes.<br /><br />Third, there is no hope whatsoever. In the film at least. He abandons the younger ones behind, the youngest has just killed Sweeney, the two others, the sailor and Todd's daughter are just abandoned alone and frightened, though they should not be too much since the preying predator of a judge has disappeared in Sweeney’s Todd meat grinder. You can also imagine what the good old English Victorian society is going to do to them when they are discovered or captured in that vast cemetery of corpses and cadavers. At the same time you may imagine some kind of clemency for the sailor since he committed no crime, well, except at the “loony-bin” where he kidnapped Johanna. As for the girl her fate is more obscure since she is a girl and has to be protected and she comes from Bedlam. So, this is this and back to Bedlam.<br /><br />Fourth, the speaking is voluntarily fuzzy, misty, dark, difficult to follow, often too low, and that is done on purpose. The dialogue is not so much important, apart from a few sentences now and then. It is an atmosphere that is created as if everyone was more or less whispering or mumbling in order not to be overheard or understood, misunderstood maybe. And the cockney of the actors is not always cockney, some pale and fuzzy imitation. But this linguistic opaque texture creates the atmos-fear of angst and fright.<br /><br />But fifth, in this atmos-fear the most important element is the music and the singing. It is in no way attractive, charming, harmonious or whatever you may expect from music and singing. It is always the same tone, even when the tune is changing, a very minor dirge that stretches out without any kind of harmony or even attractive rhythm. It is a slow tempo for a very flat music and a minimal singing. A dirge I said, maybe even more than that, the complaint of surviving undead living-dead ghosts. We are in the deepest most sinister cul-de-sac blind alley you can imagine in full darkness, with no public light, just a smidgeon of moonlight between two heavy clouds and a lot of dark ill-smelling if not foul smoke coming out of the chimney of this diabolical barbershop-cum-pie-factory.<br /><br />And Sweeney Todd is so much engulfed in his vengeance that he does not see anything any more. He is made blind by his desire, impulse and need to kill in order to alleviate his conviction that he was convicted for no reason at all and eliminated for the only sake of stealing his wife Lucy. And that leads him to the supreme killing: he kills his own wife who has become a deranged, hallucinating and totally mental beggar roaming around the judge’s house, her own predator. Sweeney Todd does not recognize his own wife except when it is too late. He nearly performs the same crime of oblivion and blindness with his own daughter, though he is distracted just in time, at the last moment when the razor was just going to hit her throat. He even gets rid of his main accomplice, Mrs. Lovett who loves it too much to accept it all, probably out of pure blind vanity and addiction, the addiction to his own vengeance and killing, and she will burn in the furnace before burning in hell for all eternity. And his unaware – well, at least for a short while – child accomplice is getting just like him at the end and the final razor cut sinks deep in our sensitive mind. Nothing to save that Sweeney Todd and his world! Victorian it is to the very last second and even right into the credits.<br /><br />If you believe in love, stay away. If you believe in the beauty of man's heart somewhere, at least the hearts of a few people, stay away: there is not one single beautiful heart in this film, not even Johanna who has been warped by her detention in the soiled hands of Judge Turpin who has the mind of a turnip merged with terpenoids that have the soul of a rubber tire and the taste or turpentine. But what is Tim Burton trying to do? To scare us witless out of our pants and frocks with what the world really is behind the shiny and sparkling façade of a fake and hypocritical vicious court of justice with wigs and potbellied rotten beadles, white ermine fur and red robes? Probably, but maybe it is his vision of the world and that is very frightening.<br /><br />A pessimistic film to make us feel relieved when we get out of it because Tim Burton has read his Aristotle and he sings his cathartic faith every morning while shaving with an electric razor, which is a lot less dangerous that the foldable machete we call a barber’s straight razor: after all, the world is not that bleak.<br /><br />But is it or is it not? Maybe it is after all. Maybe it is not all in all.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUt leads him to the supreme killing: he kills his own wife who has become a deranged, hallucinating and totally mental beggar roaming around the judge’s house, her own predator.

B0011HOEY4|4.0|We opted to watch the \\"Director's Cut\\" of this film and whilst just under three hours, we found it enthralling and were riveted.  Initially slow off the mark, this extended version takes the time to develop the characters and the slow pace  - in the end - makes for great viewing.  The performances of both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are outstanding and given it's based on a true story, makes the story all the more facanating.    We are now keen to see the \\"theatrical version\\" and compare.
0743298039|5.0|Our neighborhood book club read this book, and we all just loved it! Great writing style, fascinating story, intricate plot that keeps you guessing until the end.  The kind of book that you just fall into, are sad when you're done, and think about for days afterward.
B000000WA4|4.0|Can't say I'm a huge fan of the \\"fuzzy\\" guitars they use on the heavier tracks - to me, it kind of spoils the power of those tracks. At least it's original. But by hell this band can knock out a ballad like no one else. No wonder they're a flagship 90s band ... no one's making music these days like they did back then (unfortunately this includes the Pumpkins, by all accounts ...) Nonetheless, good stuff.
B0010X8NF0|2.0|I was excited to see this movie however walked away very dissapointed. Unlike many of Wes Anderson's movies watching this one again will not make it better.    As a fan of the last few Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson films, this movie had very little of the dry, witty elements of movies like \\"Life Aquatic..\\", \\"Royal Tenenbaums\\", etc.      This film has a few little laughs along the way, however always veers back into drama, leaving you wanting more humor. However, the attempts at humor break up the drama, leaving you in the middle.       Good performances from Owen Wilson & Adrien Brody, however Jason Schwartzman adds little.    Bill Murray makes a quick cameo in the first 45 seconds and maybe he was exactly what was missing.     Unfortunately, this film gets stuck between a drama and a comedy and satisfies neither.  I'll look fwd to the next Wes Anderson film but I can't reccomend this one in good faith.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is a series that you can't believe how much you like all the characters. And it's hard to pull yourself away from the TV screen, so fair warning, only watch when you have the weekend free. That's how good this series is.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|My husband brought this DVD home from the video store this weekend.  He sometimes brings home odd things and certainly the title and cover of this DVD were no exception.  I took one look at it, turned up my nose and said \\"Uggh, I have no interest in seeing this.  What in the world caused you to pick it out?\\"  He said, \\"Oh, it's some British movie and it's supposed to be funny.\\" I gave him a good eyeroll.    I actually missed the first 15 minutes of the movie because I wasn't interested in watching it at all, much less being there from the beginning.  Within a minute of sitting down with him though I was laughing hysterically.  So hysterically in fact, that our daughter came in from the next room where she was sitting with headphones on, music blaring in her ears, because she could hear us screaming with laughter.  When she came in to the room, my husband and I were balled up in fits of tearful laughter and couldn't even talk to her.    When the movie was over, all I could say was \\"Oh - my - gosh!  That was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe and thought I was going to throw up.  Then I couldn't sleep because I kept laughing.    Of course, it's not a movie you can talk about at the water cooler because people just won't understand why playing with toilet paper, talking to a deceased man's dwarf lover, or walking on a roof naked are funny.  You just have to see it to understand.
1590171993|5.0|This book topped my expectations.  Not only was the story riveting but the writing tight.

0452286751|4.0|The Fountainhead is one of those rare books that actually make one question one's own life. This intriguing novel by Ayn Rand is based on her life's philosophy of objectivism, the belief that the individual is more important than the whole, the antithesis of collectivism, objectivism holds that to be selfish is not bad, but in fact the best thing one can be.      The plot of this book centers around a New York architect named Howard Roark who refuses to compromise on his work. He exemplifies, in Ayn Rand's point of view, the perfect man. In his struggle against the society that seeks to assimilate him into their unopinioned masses, Roark interacts with many other complex characters. Characters such as Peter Keating, who is the epitome of someone ruled by the masses; Dominique Francon, the female who tries to be the equal to Roark's Greatness; Ellsworth Toheey, the evil leader of the masses; and Gail Wynand, an individual who has the potential to be great but fails.         The interactions of these well-developed characters sets an interesting background for a story that challenges the value of altruism and touts the value of the ego. All in all a very interesting, though quite lengthy, novel that is worth reading.                                                                  -Casey C.

0307388840|1.0|This book fails to live up to expectations. The novel is so dull and dreary and worse, the characters lack the necessary spine for this reader to have any sympathy with them. The characters are all too typical - the man of the man working to the point he has little contact with his family, the wife, a 'migraine' sufferer; read invalid of the type one finds in the Pre-Raphaelite Era. So bad was this book, I never completed it because I simply didn't care what happened or didn't happen. My suggestion to potential buyers of this book is to spend the money on another book and leave this one where I did, in with the trash.
B00005JN0T|4.0|An action/police procedual movie \\"inspired\\" by the work of Issac Asimov, and starring Will Smith.<br /><br />I was reluctant to see this movie for a long time, until my friend Bridgette convinced me that it was worth watching. My reluctance came from the fact that the movie is very unlike the original Asimov stories, with only the Laws of Robotics and a few names making the transition.<br /><br />The movie stars Smith as Del Spooner, Chicago police officer who has a real grudge against robots.  This is hinted at in the opening title sequence, and is later explained in full detail just why Del has a problem with robots that no one else seems to share or understand.  His boss at the precinct can't control him, his beloved grandmother chides him for his attitude, and he rubs everyone and everything raw, especially when it comes to the mechanical entities which now dominate Chicago and the rest of the U.S. in 2034.<br /><br />So when Robot inventor Dr. Alfred Lanning (played in holograms by James Cromwell) dies in an apparent suicide, but asking for Del in his death message, Del's dislike for robots is put to the test as he visits the gargantuan building that holds US Robotics.  Del's abrasive personality and style are matched against the cool and collected Dr. Calvin (Bridget Moynihan).  It seems at first that Del's presence is useless and worse than useless. However, the apperance of Sonny (Alan Tudyk) and evidence suggesting that Lanning could not have committed suicide starts a chain of action sequences and investigations that reveal an audacious plan involving the latest model of robot to be released...<br /><br />While the movie is 65% action and police procedural, and 30% science fiction, the movie does have a small dose of philosophy and the spirit of the original Asimov work  As a minor spoiler, I will reveal here that, while not put directly in those terms, the movie's plot revolves around the \\"0th law\\".  The first time I saw the movie, I recognized this immediately, and on this re-viewing, I appreciate that Proyas (who also directed [[ASIN:0780622553 Dark City (New Line Platinum Series)]] subtly inserted this distillation of the three laws.  Proyas is a great director even if this movie, with its car chases and pyrotechnics does not play to his greatest strengths.<br /><br />Cromwell does fine as a hologram, Moynihan does okay as Calvin.  Tudyk provides a human face to Sonny the robot. Still, this movie, like many of his movies, belongs to Smith's Del Spooner. Smith is as always a protagonist which the viewers can follow. Even if, unlike many of his roles, Del's personality and history have a dark edge that (until this movie) Smith had never really explored before in movie roles.  I note wryly that this is the second SF movie he has been in that he has been a police officer. ([[ASIN:B0000640SB Men in Black (Deluxe Edition)]] being the first).<br /><br />The movie IS a summer blockbuster type movie, but definitely in the upper tier of that subset of movies.  The movie doesn't fail to entertain and I enjoyed it a lot.g, I appreciate that Proyas (who also directed [[ASIN:0780622553 Dark City (New Line Platinum Series)]] subtly inserted this distillation of the three laws.

B000002GYR|5.0|It came out in 1973, but Tom Waits' debut doesn't really sound like it comes from any particular time. In its smokey corridors we can hear strains of everything from Howlin' Wolf to Frank Sinatra to Hank Williams to Randy Newman, we can hear the Great American Songbook quivering under desolate country melodies, with bleary strains of blues and folk and jazz wriggling their way through the mix, with warm, cracked vocals and spare lyrics, all of it evoking raw twilights and quiet fall afternoons and solitary sunset drives and an endless succession of long, lonely nights among seedy bars and half-lit bedrooms and still streets twisting through a sleeping city under a pale moon. Ever had a night like that? Waits has clearly had more than his share. As such, Closing Time is the sound of a state of mind, an aesthetic, a feeling, an entire world that exists between dreamscape and consciousness, between life and ether. It's the national anthem of the sleepless night, the muttering, beating heart of loneliness and quiet desperation. As old as time, and as immediate as the pangs of lost love. It's a gorgeous, gorgeous album,  and one that everybody should hear.

4770030096|4.0|When you begin learning Japanese, you'll hear the \\"Japanese for Busy People\\" book series mentioned quite a bit. It is hailed by many as the best learning tool for learning Japanese, and more specifically for JLPT.<br /><br />Though I have been studying Japanese for a few months, I decided to pick up this and volume II at a Barnes and Nobles a week ago.<br /><br />First of all, I love that this version is all kana. Kana need to be learned and used as early as possible in your Japanese learning experience. I like that they also have a Romanized version, for people who may be using \\"Japanese for Busy People\\" as their first tool. I do wish that they would include a better description of Kana and Romanji in the description though. I can see how it would be easy for someone to purchase this version online without knowing that they needed to be able to read kana.<br /><br />The book first introduces a series of nine characters, all of which are somehow connected to the fictional \\"ABC Foods\\" store. These characters are rather pointless however, as there really seems to be no ongoing story or any reason why the reader needs to know about these nine characters. It's just a little thing that bugged me.<br /><br />The twenty-five lessons span across eleven units, each unit sort of piecing together similar grammatical ideas. Each lesson contains a script of a short conversation between two people and a translation at the bottom. This is followed by a series of notes that explain certain concepts in the conversation. After this, the book delves into some vocab terms and finally it tests your knowledge by asking for you to write example sentences. Each unit is ended by taking a test, the answers to which are in the back of the book. The overall layout is good, but I was excited to hear about the \\"Culture notes\\" at the beginning of each unit. I was disappointed to see that the notes are about two paragraphs describing VERY basic information (Talks about bowing in one unit, another describes Sushi and Tenpura). If you want an idea of Japanese culture, you will need to get a book specifically aimed at that.<br /><br />Let me say this: If you hate taking classes and reading textbooks then this book is NOT for you. This is basically a watered downed school textbook, in fact I understand it is often used as a textbook for Japanese classes.<br /><br />But if you a truly committed to learning the Japanese language, then this textbook is a great way to do it. If you pull your hair out at the thought of taking a Japanese class to do it, you should probably find another method of learning :).<br /><br />Positives:<br />-Twenty-five lessons that cover nearly all the needed grammatical information.<br /><br />-Example sentences and tests that help the reader test their abilities to write and speak Japanese.<br /><br />-Glossary, index of particles, and sentence structures make it easy to find exactly what you're looking for.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-Reads like a textbook. Not for users who are looking to learn Japanese but hesitant to go to a classroom.<br /><br />-So-called \\"Culture notes\\" are really just a few paragraphs that talk about very basic info that most people probably already know.<br /><br />-The blank spaces they give you to write example sentences are often much to short to fit the whole sentence in.

0143113100|5.0|Brain research has made breakthroughs that can benefit just about everyone. Most individuals can benefit enormously by simply changing the kinds of inputs they provide their minds. This book discusses what some of those changes and inputs would be. Other benefits can also arise with other things people can do (also discussed in this book).    On a larger scale, this research holds the answer to the stupidity epidemic that is presently overwhelming our society. We see colossal stupidity on a massive scale in many ways, such as the $9 trillion USA federal debt that is growing even faster this year than last because Congress has increased the level of irrational spending. The book doesn't explore the idea of reversing aggregate stupidity, but it's one that struck me again and again as I read the book. If a critical mass of people engaged in purposeful brain input management, that could start a trend of diminishing stupidity. Maybe the book leaves this idea alone in an effort to avoid political commentary.    The Brain That Changes Itself sheds light on why so many people can't filter information, focus, or use the tools of reasoning--and why others can. Consequently, it provides us with insight on the effects of brain retraining--plus the how, what, and why. We also learn who some of the key players have been in the long battle to bring the concept of brain plasticity into the medical mainstream.    This is not really a self-help book, but it does give the reader a good overview of where brain science is today and how it might be personally useful. Most people are unwitting participants in the wrong kind of brain training (for example, watching television), as evidenced by many metrics of mental performance (such as the \\"sound bite attention spans\\" of today). You are always training your brain, whether you are trying to or not--that's a \\"between the lines\\" point that frequently emerges while reading this book.    Dr. Doidge brings us the latest brain research with reallife accounts that are both informative and inspiring. The main principle he illustrates is the brain rewires itself based on a \\"use it or lose it\\" model. A related principle is \\"neurons that fire together wire together.\\" The various accounts that demonstrate or prove these principles are fascinating.    The book shows conclusively how wrong some long-held beliefs are (for example, that people can't become smarter or learn new skills when they are older). It also justifies other beliefs (for example, talk therapy works--and it does so because it causes the physical structure of the brain to change). The book mostly does that with detailed accounts of individuals who have pushed the frontiers of brain science forward--often despite powerful opposition or hardships.    The brain, as Doidge repeatedly points out with evidence, logic, and anecdotes, is plastic (malleable). It adapts to its inputs, forming new neural connections, new structures (arrangements of cells), and even new cells as needed. We do not yet know the limits of this plasticity or how to drive the brain all the way to its limits. But we have some amazing examples of where limits that would seem \\"fixed\\" don't actually exist. Two such examples are the woman with half a brain (meaning not that she's a member of Congress but that she physically has only one hemisphere--the other half of her skull is empty) and the Sea Gypsies who have developed extreme control over their eyes so they can see clearly even thirty feet under water.    Unlike many works that are in the nonfiction section today, this one actually is nonfiction. It contains no political agenda, and it doesn't stray off topic. Clues to how authoritative The Brain That Changes Itself is may be found by perusing the notes and references section--which, at over 80 pages, makes up about 20% of the book.    This book contains 11 chapters and two Appendices. The first two chapters are inspiring stories of people who had seemingly insurmountable afflictions but used brain training to almost completely overcome them.    Chapter Three is more for \\"normal\\" people who are interested in becoming smarter. It details the research of Michael Merzenich on sharpening perception, improving memory, and increasing the speed of thought. Merzenich also delved into solving learning problems. The next chapter should hook just about everybody, as it explains the role of neuroplasticity in love and sexual attraction.    The next two chapters go into specific problems and how brain plasticity relieved them or even provided a total cure. Chapter Seven explores the dark side of plasticity, looking at such things as how brainwashing works. The flipside of that is the subject of Chapter Eight.    In Chapter Nine, research shows how and why \\"talk therapy\\" causes beneficial structural changes to the brain. These changes are more effective than drugs or surgery, because they solve the root problem rather than masking or muting the symptoms. There has long been a close-minded, one-sided \\"debate\\" in the medical profession as to the merits of psychoanalysis (or alleged lack thereof). The research explained in this chapter would appear to settle the \\"question\\" with finality.    It has long been canonical in medical literature that, while the liver and other organs can self-repair, the brain can't. Chapter Ten discusses why this isn't the case and what the implications are for a wide variety of conditions.    The eleventh chapter is the story of a woman who has only her right hemisphere. Her left hemisphere just never developed, leaving her with half a brain. The rich detail of this account makes for fascinating, page-turning reading. But the real value lies in the lessons we can take away from it, and those lesson are profound. Doidge highlights some of the implications of this case study, but just thinking about it later is a real mind-bender.    I'm a bit puzzled as to why the two Appendices aren't simply Chapter Twelve and Thirteen, especially since Appendix One is chapter-length. It could be because in the Appendices the author has inserted his own views and speculations, whereas in the eleven Chapters he took the role of reporter rather than commentator.    In any case, Appendix One looks at the interplay of brain plasticity and culture. Appendix Two is short, and it discusses the double-edged sword aspect of \\"progress\\" and \\"perfectibility\\" in regard to brain plasticity.    This book is on my \\"must read\\" list. A book that dovetails nicely with this one is The New Brain.

B0010X73ZG|4.0|This was a very good horror. The people involved most definitely had loads to be scared of. Lots of tension. Great special effects. Most of the deaths appeared to be excruciating. I love when a group destabilizes into a mob. It's always fascinating for me to watch civility drop away and mob mentality kick in. Many Steven King movies are not worth your time but this one is. There were a handful of moments when I was practically screaming, \\"Why is nobody saying the clear truth?! Why aren't they already running?! What are they waiting for?! How are they failing to see the obvious?!\\" But I think that's the curse of most horror films. There are gaps in logic either in the plot or the characters themselves. But then, I've actually been in many very bad, crisis situations in life so I suppose I'm cursed to nitpick. You have to let that roll off so you can enjoy the show. As a father, I found the ending to be utterly horrific. It was a mental kick in the teeth for me as I tried to imagine myself in the hero's place. The music in the end credits was very haunting and soulful. I've never felt the need to rate the music before but this time it was suitable. This was a heavy story.

B0013F2LSK|4.0|Prime Cuts:  I Thought I'd Seen It All, Tonight We Have the Stars, We Found What We Were Looking For<br /><br />\\"11,\\" Bryan Adams' 11th eleven album containing 11 tracks, may not break any creative bounds but it's still consummate Adams.  Perhaps lethargy is the rearing its head for this 48-year-old vegan rocker, this new release finds Adams charting the same territory of rock anthems and love ballads, a tuff he has had been loitering for the last 25 years.  Even though these are newly composed paeans, the lack of originality is apparent in its worn-and-out overused song titles \\"Walk on By,\\" \\"We Found What We Were Looking For\\"(think U2), \\"Mysterious Ways\\" (U2 again), \\"Broken Wings\\" and \\"Oxygen.\\" Further, clich&eacute;s abound, \\"she comes to me like rain falls down my window,\\" \\"the world is full of mysteries/full of magic and of wonder,\\" and \\"we found our wings and now we fly above the wind.\\" Nevertheless, with all that said, why in the world would Adams re-invent himself after all this success he has garnered?

B000PFU7OO|5.0|As a music lover from the age of rock and roll to today's eclectic range, I found this soundtrack both lyrically and musically captivating, soothing, original, and very, very real...The simple piano background and the unique vocal quality of the lead singers Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova can be listened to over and over...especially the first two songs.  I play it every day and never tire of the beauty and simplicity of the words and the music.  Don't miss the DVD \\"Once\\", either.  My favorite movie of 2007, by far.....and emotional,timeless, musical journey....
B0013N8VWW|4.0|Prime Cuts:  I Thought I'd Seen It All, Tonight We Have the Stars, We Found What We Were Looking For<br /><br />\\"11,\\" Bryan Adams' 11th eleven album containing 11 tracks, may not break any creative bounds but it's still consummate Adams.  Perhaps lethargy is the rearing its head for this 48-year-old vegan rocker, this new release finds Adams charting the same territory of rock anthems and love ballads, a tuff he has had been loitering for the last 25 years.  Even though these are newly composed paeans, the lack of originality is apparent in its worn-and-out overused song titles \\"Walk on By,\\" \\"We Found What We Were Looking For\\"(think U2), \\"Mysterious Ways\\" (U2 again), \\"Broken Wings\\" and \\"Oxygen.\\" Further, clich&eacute;s abound, \\"she comes to me like rain falls down my window,\\" \\"the world is full of mysteries/full of magic and of wonder,\\" and \\"we found our wings and now we fly above the wind.\\" Nevertheless, with all that said, why in the world would Adams re-invent himself after all this success he has garnered?

B000RW3YYA|5.0|I certainly enjoy this show.  I think it's fun and the effects are enjoyable to watch.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|LOVED this movie.  Tracy Turnblad gives hope and inspiration.  Nikki Blonsky was PERFECTLY cast for the movie.  Actually the only person I would have recast is John Travolta.  He is neither funny, nor believable, and I think he ruins the movie.    Everyone else in the movie, in my humble opinion, works great.  Very talented group.  Queen Latifah is perfectly cast, too!!  As are the characters Seaweed & Corny Collins.    John Travolta was a HORRIBLE choice, and I love most of Travolta's stuff, just not here.  Wrong, all wrong for this part.    The movie is uplifting though, if you can look past the character of Edna.  I recommend the movie as a whole!  OVERWHELMINGLY- and for the record I don't like musicals.  Just this one and Grease.  (Where Travolta was perfectly cast as Danny Zucco.)
0805211063|5.0|Hearing about Kafka's work is not enough: you really need to read it and experience it yourself.  It's hilarious, and unfortunately all too true.<br /><br />In this book, a surveyor, named K., arrives in a village and tries to get in to the castle in order to get permission to stay there and do his work, but falls into a quagmire of disfunctional bureaucracy.  This may sound like a dreary read, but the book is really very funny, and reminded me too much of the real world.  K spends most of the book on a fruitless quest to meet an official named Klamm who might be able to help him get into the castle.  I laughed out loud at some of the ridiculous conversations he has with some of the villagers, and later I gasped in amusement and dismay as I learned more about this twisted world.<br /><br />Kafka never finished writing this book, and the restored text, of which this is a translation, ends in the middle of a sentence.  However this doesn't really make it any less satisfying to read.  While it is not clear where the last couple of pages are going, just before that there is a long paranoid rant by one of the villagers which is great.<br /><br />This translation seems to be more accurate than the older, Muir translation.  There are some things that sound kind of weird here, but they sound weird in the original too.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Live Free, Die Hard had me grinning from ear to ear.  Because of the overblown trailers, I feared the movie would contain only explosions and car crashes, with no plot.  Thankfully, this movie is well done, with a good story, good enough acting, fantastic lighting, and good sets.  And how refreshing to see a movie not reliant on computer-generated special effects.  This film is a testosterone feast a la 300.  Highly recommended for old school action movie buffs.  This is a classic.<br /><br />Through the whole movie, one thing drove me crazy.  For the life of me, I could not recall where I had seen the actor who played the young hacker.  He looked so familiar.  My husband came down to watch the last part with me.  He pointed the actor out as the Mac in the Mac & PC ads!
B000ZN802W|5.0|I read Into the Wild almost immediately after it came out. The story profoundly affected me as I could see myself in the lead character. I spent a wayward, peripatetic youth similar to McCandless, but I never had the will or folly to give it all up and become the Supertramp that McCandless became. Sometimes film adaptations of books are disappointing, but when the movie was released on pay per view I finally decided to watch it. Sean Penn is the kind of writer/director that can take on a story like this because he obviously can relate to the character's iconoclastic nature and powerful willpower that sent him on a tragic, almost Quixotic quest. I was very happy with the job he did creating and directing this film.<br /><br />I'd never heard of Emile Hirsch but I think he put in a DeNiro type performance in this film. Its almost eerie in the way he was able to physically transform himself into an almost spitting image of the story's tragic protagonist. In the end when McCandless's self portrait was displayed it looked so much like Hirsch that initially I didn't realize the difference. The bottom line, this guy is a great character actor, able to transform himself physically-incredible performance.<br /><br />The Cinematography in the film is incredible in the way it depicts the wide open spaces of the west in contrast to the rat race of the East coast. Go west young man is an age old theme in American literature and culture. Being a Coloradan, I have met many McCandlesses', disaffected East coasters inebriated by the wide open space and sunshine of the American west. The camera work is incredible and at times haunting as it creates a powerful mood for the story. The quiet and desolation of the Alaskan wilderness is very well portrayed. The scenes of the under-prepared adventurer trudging off into the spring melt down resonate for me. I never made it any farther north than Juneau,Alaska in my early wanderings but I have done some backpacking in Canada and I know what its like to walk off into the forest with a rifle knowing that if anything happens, rescuers are far away. Luckily I had companions and years of outdoor experience under my belt. Seeing CM go off by himself is a haunting vision.<br /><br />A few years ago I did one hundred miles on the Colorado trail solo, hiking from Denver to Breckinridge in the early season and crossed the divide at midnight, under a full moon, in waist deep snow. Along the way I saw only about a half a dozen people although I did have rendez-vous points and half way through the journey I was resupplied by my parents on top of a mountain pass and had a nice hot meal before taking on the rest of my challenge. I had a satellite cell phone and check-in points as well as a good topo and lots and lots of experience in the wilderness. The loneliness and fine line between euphoria and a type of lonely insanity of solo-ing in the wilderness is very well portrayed by the actor and director. There is a dividing line between the ideal of the wilderness retreat that we imagine when sitting inside our dwellings with running water and central heating and the actual hardship of living in the dirt. I didn't try to live off the land like CM, I brought dehydrated rations and sophisticated water purification equipment. I could see the folly of his pursuit in a way many others couldn't. This wasn't explicitly outlined in the movie but any Outdoors man who talked to Christopher probably would have wondered about him and been worried by his lack of logistics for a solo outing in the harshness of the Alaskan wilderness.<br /><br />The greatest tradgedy of this quest is that this man rejected all those who loved and cared about him in his quest to find himself. The way the story is narrated by his sister leaves a horrible undertone of melancholy. In the end of the movie when the final self-portrait of the tragic protagonist is displayed, I was moved to tears. This was a like-able young man, not some alienated dead-ender, and that is very well portrayed by Hirsch. Alaska is a kind of end of the road place for a lot of society's outcasts. McCandless wasn't one of those people, you got the profound impression that if he would of made it back he would have been able to successfully re-enter society. The tragedy is in the that this was a misguided rite of passage, a liminal experience that ended in death. The movie and all the supporting actors did great justice to this theme. This is actually one of the better movies I've seen in quite awhile and I recommend both the book and movie. The former should become part of the reading curriculum for high school & college English courses-similar to Catcher in the Rye but with a more contemporary theme that many of us peripatetic wanderers; alienated intellectual seekers can relate to.ed by Hirsch.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|Will Smith carries this movie by himself, except for the talented German Shepard who actually shows emotions(played by 2 different dogs). My family and I read the book first, actually a short story printed along with some other stories in the same paperback... obviously, shadows of the original written work gave the screenwriters the idea for the movie but it ends there. It's a TOTALLY different story up there on the screen. I bought the 2 disc version, each disc with a different ending. Glad I did because my family and I much preferred the 2nd disc. I always hate clicking in the menu of a movie to see just the \\"alternate ending\\" tucked in by itself, out of context. Having the complete movie run right to and through the alternate ending was much better. And about the free enclosed digital copy, you have to download it from the internet before the expiration date inside the case.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|I was very pleased with the item. It has given us many hours of enjoyment and I would recomend it to any fan of Andrea Bocelli.
B0010X745K|3.0|I bought this film, sight unseen, because Frank Darabont has done flawless work with 2 other King adaptations (Shawshank & Green Mile). Aside from being a rip-off of John Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\", I expected a whole lot more. I simply didn't find any originality in the goings-on, with the exception of the excellent, ironic ending. After reading previous reviews, I must say I thought Andre Braugher played his annoying character fairly well, and the usually reliable Marcia Gay Harden was, indeed, over the top. (Piper Laurie might've done it better, since it's what she does well). Thomas Jane was fine, as was Laurie Holden; there are other King connections, too, with fine performances from Jeffrey deMunn (Green Mile) and Frances Sternhagen (Misery). The monsters weren't terribly original, and it just seemed like the film was lacking focus during the middle part. The ending, however, was so totally devastating that I'm glad I stuck it out. I await Mr. Darabont's next film, which I hope will be his redemption.

B00132D808|5.0|First and foremost before you listen to this album you must understand: THIS IS NOTHING LIKE PANIC'S FIRST ALBUM.  If you are looking for the same thing as on \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" then don't even bother with this album.  HOWEVER, if you claim to be a fan of music in general this album is an absolute must.    Now that's said, this album is AMAZING.  It's obvious that Panic has became very heavily influenced by the Beatles (specifically their later work: Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's, Yellow Submarine, Magical Mystery Tour, etc.)  This has helped Panic to create an album that is nothing short of a musical odyssey.  Each song has its own unique sound and creates its own individual feeling in the listener.  So if you let this album totally absorb you, its a complete mind trip that you won't soon forget.   A lot of people are going to bash this album because it's not only completely different from what Panic did on their first album, but its also completely different from what most musicians have been doing in the last 20+ years.  Give this album a chance though because honestly this is one of craziest albums I have listened to in a long time.

0143038419|2.0|Pros: At times Gilbert writes in an interesting and funny way making SMALL PARTS of this book entertaining to read.    Cons: The rest of the book (a majority of it) is painful to read. The book is more of a pity party for Gilbert's failed marriage than it is a deep look into these amazing cultures.    It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but I would recommend spending your money on something else.
B000005ALN|5.0|This post \\"FAITH\\" CD suffers the same fate as \\"Listen Without Prejudice\\".  After the smash success of \\"Faith\\" most of GM's fans wanted and demanded another remake.  Like his previous CD release, \\"Listen Without Prejudice\\", George Michael went down a different path.  On the first few listens, \\"OLDER\\" doesn't grab you the same way as \\"FAITH\\" did.    But this is one of those rare CD's that rewards the listener APLENTY if they're willing to give the songs some time.  With each repeated listen, layers of instrumentation and subtle shadings start to come thru the mix.  George Michael has NEVER sounded as subtle as he does here.  He shows maturity, growth, and depth not only in his songwriting, but also in his singing.  He does not go for the jugular like he did almost a decade earlier (nine years separated the two CD's releases) with his still best-selling \\"FAITH\\" CD.  When this CD was released in 1996, GM was almost a decade older (hmmm.....maybe thus the title's name?).      I can only applaud his courage and willingness to take risks, even if it means taking a dive commercially.  I don't think CD sales for \\"OLDER\\" were as bad as \\"Listen Without Prejudice\\".  Many fans have speculated if \\"OLDER\\" might be \\"Listen Without Prejudice, Volume TWO\\", but George Michael has never admitted or confirmed this, so we will keep guessing.  Parts of \\"OLDER\\" are so moving that I am almost close to tears, especially listening to it late at night when the world is asleep.  This is one CD to be savored and enjoyed for its painstaking attention to details.  It shows what great care George Michael has gone to present a product that is close to his heart.  It also shows what a great artist George Michael really is and how we've taken his name and dragged it thru the mud just because of a careless indiscretion in a Hollywood men's restroom, a fact he will probably never live down (a sad shame).  I wish his longtime fans will give \\"OLDER\\" a chance and get grooved to the beautiful songs George Michael has presented us.  Hell, he even throws in \\"FAST LOVE\\" which sounds like a carry over from \\"FAITH\\".  All in all, a beautiful work of art from \\"Curious George\\".  Well done.

1400063515|4.0|A few years ago \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" did open my eyes and fascinate me.

B0001GMIOE|4.0|This lasts for a longer time than I though possible on a Canon 30D, taking say 100 shots over a couple of hours per day it has lasted for about a week... I haven't really used the built-in flash but I do review every shot on the built in screen. It recharges in a couple of hours.    It's still a good idea to get a spare battery, just in case... I didn't feel comfortable buying a no-name battery for such a great camera; the bottom line is I did get over the initial sticker shock and this will prove to be good value for money if it continues like this in the medium and longer term.

It's supposed to be simple - but the numerous innovative guitar riffs by Tony Iommi that are sprinkled throughout these songs cannot be denied.  And I like Ozzy's singing style - it's clear but distant and without emotion.    The poor sound quality is not just the fault of the CD - I remember buying this record when it first came out in 1971 the year I graduated from HS and was disappointed in the sound quality back then in comparison to many other hard rock LPs at the time such as Led Zep II, III & IV, The Who \\"Who's Next\\", Deep Purple \\"In Rock\\", The Stones \\"Sticky Fingers\\",  etc.  It had the same muted sound quality as Blue Oyster Cult's first LP that came out in 1972.  So I can't give it 5 stars but the 4 songs mentioned above literally changed the heavy metal world and that is worth 4 stars alone.    My personal favorite \\"War Pigs\\" has one of the greatest sequences of lead guitar \\"ideas\\" that I've heard and ends with a heart wrenching melody that to me symbolized the tragedy of war, whereas the style of music in the rest of the song dealt with the brutality and and idiocy of war.    As for the other big 4 songs, my second favorite is \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" which like \\"War Pigs\\" ends with a great high end guitar riff, similar to the end of Dire Straits \\"Sultans of Swing\\" that came out many years later.  The counter-play between guitar riffs and drums in \\"Fairies..\\" is simply excellent.  Ozzy's vocals are perfectly brilliant in this song - even though I don't know what the hell it means.  But who cares!  It's the music and \\"sound\\" of the vocals, not the lyrics, that are important in these songs.  The guitar riff in \\"Fairies..\\" that begins at 2:40 is just classic.  It is this riff that transitions into the higher end riff at the end of the song at5:40 that is just spectacular.  I don't care if it's simple - it works!    When it first came out, I remember the song \\"Paranoid\\" got alot of AM Top 40 airplay. I remember sitting in the High School cafeteria when this song would come on the radio over the PA system mixed in with songs like Three Dog Night's \\"Joy to the World\\", Nilsson's \\"Without You\\" and Isaac Hayes \\"Theme from Shaft\\"!  Hilarious!  All of us nerds in the back corner would start bobbing our heads up and down while everyone else looked on in shock!  But the repetitive guitar riff takes the song only so far and it has never been one of my favorite 3 minute songs.  As a part of an album it's great but it's not a strong enough song to carry an album by itself.    As for the fourth of the BIG 4, I've never warmed to \\"Iron Man\\" - the robotic vocal and ultra slow guitar riff at the beginning turns me off the same way BOC's \\"Godzilla\\" did, even though BOC is one of my favorite rock bands.  The song gets better later on but I can't get past the beginning.    So PARANOID has to be ranked at least 4 stars and shame on those who give it less.  But I can't give it 5 stars because it's not great all the way through and the sound quality is bad.  Also, I would say that at least 2 of Black Sabbath's songs, \\"Sweet Leaf\\" and \\"N.I.B.\\", that are on other albums are better than any song on PARANOID.    I would definitely put PARANOID in the top 20 of albums that came out in 1971, but there was alot of competition in this year that included all styles of rock music.  Black Sabbath along with Led Zep, Deep Purple, Blue Oyster Cult, UFO, Mountain, Uriah Heep, Atomic Rooster and several other groups moved rock into a heavier, more mystical direction that split off from the blues/rock of the Stones, the Who, Fleetwood Mac (pre-Stevie), Savoy Brown, Wishbone Ash, Free, Trapeze, and pre-disco Rod Stewart.  All great stuff.
B000P12LWY|5.0|After reading The Other Bolyn Girl I was so excited to watch these DVDs.  I was not disappointed.  My husband even likes the show!
B000YABYLA|5.0|My wife and I loved this movie so much we subsequently saw it three more times, the fourth time with me sitting in the theater with the Shooting Script book in one hand, and my cell phone in the other to illuminate its pages. I'd watch/listen to the movie, and scribble in the script where the movie on screen differed from what was written. (For the record, the movie is about 40% different from what appears in the Shooting Script.) I did that because I'm a budding screenwriter myself and I wanted to understand how this superb movie was created. So I took it apart the way someone would disassemble a watch or a car engine, examining every part to see why the whole worked so well.    In the end, what I concluded is that Juno is the perfect marriage of a well-crafted script by Diablo Cody, brilliant directing by Jason Reitman, and sublime acting by everyone, but especially Ellen Page, Michael Cera, and Jason Bateman. This is how Hollywood *should* work -- with no one aspect of the film process dominating another.    I don't know what to say about Juno that hasn't already been noted in all these reviews. You know what the story is about: a 16-year-old who gets pregnant, decides to keep the baby and put it up for adoption, and what happens to her life given her decision. Ellen Page deserved the Oscar for her performance, but an Oscar nomination is equally as impressive for an actress who just turned 21.    Yet, if you want to see a study in absolutely sublime acting, watch Michael Cera, who plays her boyfriend Paulie Bleeker. His mannerisms, facial expressions, and dialog delivery are so totally spot-on that he doesn't appear to be acting at all. He truly looks like Paulie Bleeker, a high-school student who discovers his girlfriend is pregnant.    The reason why Juno received so much attention (including a well-deserved Oscar win for screenwriter Diablo Cody) is because this is the freshest, most intelligent, most endearing movie to come along in decades. There's nothing not to love about Juno. Even the quirky soundtrack is perfect. (And I bought it the minute it was released.)    Juno is now nestled in my all-time Top Five movies. True, it's not as \\"important\\" as Casablanca, Chinatown, The Godfather, or even When Harry Met Sally. But it represents what I hope is a new level of excellence to which Hollywood should aspire. This is a very funny, heartwarming movie that bears up to many repeated viewings. (Try that with 75% of the movies Hollywood releases each year.)    Lest you think I'm a Juno fanboy (which I am), I will admit this slight criticism of the movie: at times, the dialog is too witty and too quick to come from the mouth of a 16 year old. At times, Juno seems so precocious that you just know she's reading lines. Yet, that can be forgiven with a movie as good as this because the story is just so darn good.    I absolutely, totally, unabashedly love this movie.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|SPOILERS AHEAD....    Stargate has always had its homages to other genre shows and they are clearly on display here -- the opening caption paraphrasing \\"a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\\", the peak-to-peak aeral shot just beging for Gondor outposts to light the signal fires, a Terminator-like rise from an explosion, ... (I'm sure folks can spot more).    The visual effects were lovely, and there were some really good bits of characterization. The converation between Teal'c and Tomin was wonderful, as was Tomin's final scene with Vala.    As for the rest...  While many a Stargate villain comes direct from Central Casting, Marrick (the IOA guy) is particularly ill-written in a series that brought us Senator Kinsey, Colonel Maybourne, and even the briefly-referenced Mr. Woolsey. In prior episodes where the IOA, NID, or Senator Kinsey were challenging the SGC often they had a legitimate PoV, even if they were wrong. Here, they are just wrong and profoundly stupid.    Similarly, Adria mostly gets to chew scenery in her scenes with Vala rather than have some character development before her inevitable defeat. (Itself a solution borrowed from Oma Desala's final battle with Anubis.)    Others have commented on problems with the Replicator subplot and Repli-terminator -- one other aside -- what did they make the walls and BLUs (blinkie-light-units, per the commentaries) out of?! Thousands of high-power rounds blasted around them, and not one bit of damage? Yet they bend when Mitchell is tossed into them? Yes, limits of CGIs, but might have been nice to show some collateral damage on a movie-scale budget.    The wounded Teal'c walking montage eventually blew my suspension of disbelief -- particularly when it is apparently occuring at the same time as Carter and Mitchell's battle with the Replicators (who knew Teal'c could walk that fast!).
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This series by itself was brilliant, one of the best documentaries of the last ten years.  But putting it on HD-DVD really gave the watcher a special experience.  Everyone who has a HD TV and Player should have this movie just to show it off.
B00122FYMO|5.0|Now, the version of \\"Holiday\\" I'm listening to is NOT from the remastered CD. That version's only 3:51 minutes long. The original version is a little over six minutes long. This is the one I love. And the song that comes after it on the album (definition of the word \\"album\\": a compilation of songs by an artist or group of artists, no matter what format it's on, whether it be on a CD or cassette tape or vinyl record), \\"Think Of Me,\\" has been a favorite of mine since I first heard it, when I bought both \\"[[ASIN:B00005J6SZ Like a Virgin]]\\" and the album \\"Madonna\\" on the same day.<br /><br />My version of \\"Madonna\\" had the original black and white cover on it, and it was called \\"Madonna,\\" with the picture of her staring straight at the camera and a fistful of necklaces and whatever else around her neck. The inside cover had her staring hopefully up, with a wistful smile on her face and her hands at the back of her head. Now, does that prove I bought them both in 1984? I was 11.<br /><br />I listen to all the songs on \\"Madonna\\" and it takes me to a happy place, where I'd sit on the wheels of my father's truck (known to all you non-truck-driver's-kids as an \\"eighteen wheeler\\") and listen to this album (on cassette) and enjoy the nice evening weather, balanced between two sets of two wheels each, side by side.<br /><br />I was never a big dance fan per se, it was the music I loved. It was happy, upbeat, and had a great beat and bass to it that couldn't be beat by anyone at the time. Also, the songs which most of the reviewers on this site have panned, \\"I Know It\\" and \\"Think Of Me,\\" were my favorite songs off the album. I'd listen to each one, over and over. Especially \\"Think Of Me.\\" The lyrics made sense to me.<br /><br />\\"Physical Attraction\\" alway bored me to death (it was stupid and went on way too long) and I was very disappointed when I got \\"You Can Dance\\" and found it included with absolutely nothing done to it to improve it (like shorten it by at least by three minutes). \\"Everybody\\" was cute with its almost-electric flute-sounding synth and the admonition to \\"come on, dance and sing, everybody, get up and do your thing!\\" I secretly loved \\"Burning Up\\" (secretly because my parents really hated Madonna anyway and if they'd heard those lyrics it would've been bye-bye Madonna tape).<br /><br />I want to warn the people who are thinking of buying this remastered version of the original album CD: some of the songs are simply remastered for better sound clarity. Others are not only remastered for better sound clarity but somewhat remixed with sounds that were NOT in the original song on the album version, such as \\"Borderline,\\" which has been, to put it politely, messed with. After the drum solo that was never in the song to begin with is when you begin to hear what the song originally sounded like. \\"Holiday\\" is also messed with in this manner as well: not only is it chopped (a song that was originally six minutes, six seconds long mysteriously going to three minutes, fifty-one seconds long), it has a bunch of instruments in it that weren't in the six-minute original.<br /><br />Now, if you can deal with the things I just pointed out, buy this CD brand new. If not, try to get a copy that came out before the remaster.

B000VWYJ8Q|4.0|Since all of the reviews on this excellent spy thriller have been on the Standard Def edition, this one is on the HD-DVD version. This edition is probably the best of the series and it's further enhanced by being in HD!! I first rented it from Netflix after seeing it in the theatres 3 months ago and their copy was so scratched that it froze in several spots that I wound up flipping it over (it's an HD/SD combo) and finishing it in Standard Def. Bought it in HD from you and the copy was in excellent shape. The disc is reference quality and keep in mind that it's only available in HD not Blu-ray.  Perhaps that will change with the demise of HD and blu-ray being the winner but if you have a HD player and an action buff, I strongly recommend adding this to your collection along with \\"Shooter\\" ,\\"King Kong\\" and \\"The Matrix\\" series.
0452286751|5.0|amazing. This book is completely worth your time. It's quite slow in the beginning, but keep reading; it gets much better.      The Fountainhead takes the reader on a journey through the life of a young architect, Howard Roark. He is the perfect archetype of Ayn Rand's ideal man: independant, idealisic, and completely selfish. He lives for himself and what he beleives in and lets no one come between that.        Rand contrasts Roark so vividly through the lives of Peter Keating and, the antagonist, Ellsworth Toohey. Keating lives for others. He constantly worries about what others might think of him, and his drive for sucess pushes him over the edge in the long run. Toohey seeks to control the public. He tells them what to think, and they listen. His goal is to destroy the creator, and to build a united world of one colletive brain.        And, of course, what's a good story without a bit of romance? Well, the readers of this novel are in for a surprise when Dominique Francon steps on the sceen. She is the perfect match for Howard Roark. She loves him with all of her being, and becasue of this, she tries to destoy him.         Sound like something you'd enjoy? If not, order it anyway. You'll thank me later. :)
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was a gift for my husband who is a huge fan of the West Wing.  We are addicted!  Watching a couple of episodes turned out to be a weekly weekend ritual.  A must buy for West Wing fans!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I watched this movie over and over again while on deployment, never tiring of it.  It is so good, I've bought it three times (the first copy was stolen, the second copy was played so much it was destroyed).  It's a must have for my collection.
B0013FSVES|4.0|The above review covers the Scotto field well, but of course obsessives can find other live recordings. And the performance with Carreras (looking like a teenager) is actually a video taped from Japanese TV and can be found from the usual sources. I can't decide if in this instance Scotto is better heard than seen, but she was an interesting and eventually distinctive artist.    My interest is in Muti. I have a hard time accepting Toscanini and Kleiber despite the profound reverence accorded both Traviata recordings (Toscanini cut as was usual at the time). Anyone who can read a piano score can see that Traviata is filled with music in waltz time (including the moving act two duet, 'dite alla giovane') -- why do we need to have this pounded into our heads? And are those the tempos and rhythmic articulations that Verdi would have heard in his head or in the early performances? Muti takes the 'pathetic' scenes, act 2, scene 1, and act 3 much more slowly. He handles agogics (the way rhythm is articulated) subtly and interestingly; suddenly one is more aware of emotion, less of the inclination to dance. He also supports these singers superbly in their serious moments, not all of which are sweetly sung, but all of which are keenly felt. Muti's choice to push the party scenes hard makes sense -- Violetta's public life is wild and dangerous.    Scotto doesn't sound young and lovely, but her authority in the part is compelling, the real thing and worth hearing. Kraus and Bruson sound old, but both really know how these parts should go (though as the other review suggests Bruson doesn't try for much nuance).    I think the sound is very good, with some distance from the voices (not a bad thing).    I gave it four stars for there will always be those who can't get around Scotto's sound, or who dislike Muti's approach, which is unusual.
B000001F3N|5.0|You remember back in the 70's when it seemed like side one of a record always contained the most memorable songs?  Well in this case it's the second side that has the best songs, specifically the final three- the emotionally brilliant \\"Let it Grow\\" with its ending you don't want to EVER end, the funky and bluesy \\"Steady Rollin' Man\\", and the poppy goodness that is \\"Mainline Florida\\".  People can take their \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" but it's NOT the best song on the album.  Remember- hit songs don't equal best songs.  Never has and never will.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Constantine is my favorite comic book movie of all time. Not only does the character display REAL FLAWS, which is refreshing, but he also has power without physically changing. In other words, he is a hero, without a flashy suit. He is cursed, and as an anti-hero that makes him earn our trust, and admiration.<br /><br />If you are watching this movie and are trying to figure it out from a Catholic point of view....okay, it's a movie. So stop the shenanigans, and enjoy the bug guy, the twin psychics, the voodoo priest, the ability to send anything to hell and to call upon the angels.<br /><br />If you are watching this movie and you have already hated Mr Reeves, please note that you are biased. He plays the character of Constantine as he was depicted in the comics well. In fact there are not too many others in Hollywood that I could imagine as irreverent and brooding as Keanu Reeves. To boot, my favorite devil portrayal makes an appearence near the end.
0140277447|3.0|I have read other accounts of Japan's  barbaric behaviour in China but this one is as nightmarish as the accounts of Germanys' entry into Poland and Russia in WW2 .  .Japan still does not acknowledge its culpability for the atrocities it committed,whereas Germany  has compensated those most  affected by their action.Whereas Germany has exhibiter  remorse Japan's history books do not acknowledge their involvement.The author serves to remind us those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it.
B0006GANN2|5.0|The French connection is a superbly cast and directed film from the early 1970s.  A hard as nails Gene Hackman cuts his way through all of the back alley dirt, and the facade of a police force gone dirtier on his way to busting one of the biggest heroin rings of all time.  The film includes a gut wrenching car chase that rivals Steve McQueen's \\"Bullet\\".  A must see film, I give it a solid two thumbs up!
B00132D808|5.0|If you were expecting another A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, you will be disappointed.  Panic is a dynamic band and it fits that this album is different than their first.  I'll admit I wasn't sure what to expect, and what I heard when I first listened through the album surprised me.  It's definitely a break from the sound and critical sarcasm of their first album.  I have continued to listen and continued to be impressed.  Ryan joins Brendon in vocals in many of the songs, and sings lead in \\"Behind the Sea.\\"  His voice harmonizes well with Brendon's and definitely has its own charm.    Some of my favorites are: \\"Nine in the Afternoon,\\" \\"She's a Handsome Woman,\\" \\"That Green Gentleman,\\" \\"Northern Downpour,\\" \\"Pas De Cheval,\\" \\"She Had the World,\\" and \\"Mad as Rabbits.\\"      I've read several reviews of Panic's Pretty. Odd.  There seems to be confusion with some people about what Panic is trying to do here.  This album is supposed to be influenced by the Beatles, and thus may be considered a tribute to the Beatles.     Some people do not realize this and criticize them for sounding like the Beatles, or not having the witty and observant lyrics of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.  The Beatles are not known for their sarcastic wit.  Their songs are generally light-hearted, often nonsensical, and occasionally romantic.    Many rock bands attempt what Panic has done with what I consider huge success on this album.  The songs and lyrics are dynamic, light-hearted, occasionally nonsensical, and sometimes romantic.  The connection between their sound on this album and the Beatles is unmistakable, yet Panic retains its uniqueness.  This could be in part due to Brendon's distinctive voice, but it is not hard to hear the similarities between songs on their first album and songs on Pretty. Odd.    Overall:  I am extremely impressed with what Panic at the Disco has done here, and would recommend it to anyone.  However, I am a huge fan of Panic at the Disco to begin with, so if you didn't like them the first time, give them a chance, and if you don't like them this time, continue on your way.
0060578793|5.0|That's what the hero in Terminator one and two said to Sarah Conner and that's what this book is saying to anyone that purchases it.  I have lived off the land for several years, seen it all and this book still covers things I've not encountered.  A most excellent book for the serious survivalist, or the guy/gal that just wants to mess around for a few days all alone in the wilderness.  It's written plainly and easily so as to not confuse the issue at hand......especially when that issue may be causing a bit of panic.  Put this in your backpack and take care knowing you've got a good friend coming along for the ride.  wolfgang
B000ASDFJU|3.0|It was great to get my collection, but once i started watching it i found out that the 30% of the CD's where scratched...and i could not see them in my TV, or computer.  I don't know if its because of the packing, but i was very desapointed after this... the rest of the product was ok after this point..
B000WCBPOG|5.0|The soundtract itself is great, with almost all of the songs on there (unfortunatly \\"I Want You (Shes So Heavy)\\" is not on there, but pretty much everything else is!) I heard the real version of \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" the other day and its really different, but the young people on this soundtract (especially Jim Sturgess) are amazing!! and are able to pull off all those great Beatles songs. I got the soundtract and the dvd at the same time (and very quickly I might add) and its great to watch the movie, and then listen to all the amazing songs. Definately for any Beatles lover!!
B0010X745K|4.0|First of all, I haven't read the Stephen King novella so my review will be based on the movie and not a comparison of the big screen adaptation.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer for The Mist, I assumed it would be a more expensive remake of John Carpenter's The Fog. Within the first ten minutes of the movie, I was convinced this was the case but then my opinion changed. It became a monster flick, and a pretty good one at that.<br /><br />Stephen King's character types remain constant from the hero to the overly insane religious figure that creates added tension beyond the creatures.<br /><br />The only thing that did irritate me and force me to remove one star from the review was the stupidity of the characters. There were way too many scenes of creature interaction when all anyone really did was stand around and make cliched comments. I could believe one character being the token idiot, but not the entire cast. No one would step up (not even the hero) and snap people into action.<br /><br />And now to the controversial ending; for me the ending was a welcomed piece of cinematography and challenging directing. All too many movies force out the happy ending to conform to the myth that people need the feel good factor when they leave the theater. I'm a big fan of movies that break such trends so when the credits rolled for the mist, the hairs on the back of my neck were left standing. I applaud Frank Darabont's direction on this and it's nice to know there are directors out there that are willing to take risks.<br /><br />If you're the type of person that likes to feel all warm and fuzzy after a movie knowing that the World is put to right again, you're not going to like the last thirty minutes.<br /><br />If however, you enjoy movies that just flat out shock you with dramatic conclusions (or lack of), then wait no more. Go buy or rent The Mist.
0525950079|3.0|I enjoyed this page-turning beach read set in the 14th century.  Good clashes with evil in entertaining if predictably fashion, with everyone having sex along the way.  There is plot, plot and more plot.  The 14th century setting adds the necessary novelty and interest to keep me mildly engaged.  This should make an excellent mini-series.  If that sounds good to you, you will not be disappointed.        On the other hand, anyone looking for serious historical or a literary thriller had better take a pass.  There is plenty of plot, but nothing below the surface.   And the characters thoughts and actions are thoroughly anachronistic, particularly the heros.  It is 21st century actors on a 14th century stage.  Moreover, one is repeatedly struck by the way everyone in the story aside from the main characters seem as simple and manipulable as children.  Finally, those of a religious bent may be upset--particularly in comparison to the predecessor novel, [[ASIN:0451225244 The Pillars of the Earth (Deluxe Edition) (Oprah's Book Club)]].  That book showed a great reverance for church architecture and some for spirituality; this book has nothing good to say about organized religion.
0452289963|3.0|What Eckhart Tolle has written here, is an intrepretation or melding of the many spirtual teachings from Buddhism, Hinduism, Zen and century old eastern philosophies into something accessible. And Oprah, is his conduit. The trouble is, as with any one interpretation he gets a few things muddled. His definitions of consciousness is left open for speculation.     Many people have devoted their entire lives in the search of the path to true consciousness. Although this book offers some gems to take with you, and does well to help awaken us to seek the deeper questions of our collective and our souls purpose, it fails to help to find your own road to consciousness. Every path to consciousness as Thich Naht Hahn, Krishnamurti, or many other spirtual teachers state, is individual, and therefore, up to each person in finding their own way. It is through meditation or as Tolle's version, in \\"the stillness of the mind\\" that we discover it for ourself.     This is an interesting book, but as most self help books, offer some things to take with you, and other things to leave behind. I urge anyone who has felt an awakening from this book, to delve into spiritual teachings further by reading some of the sources Mr. Tolle names in his book. Still, I recommend this book as opening the doorway to enlightenment.
B00008GKEG|5.0|When I borrowed this DVD set from our Bass player, I couldn't believe the treasure of music and information about the most innovative music group of the last century. It's simply awesome! Get it now while it can be had.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I can tell you that this movie is a rarity that not only it did it have a great story that made sense, but it was a great match for the music. I know that they designed the plot to go w/ the music and they did a fantastic job. It's a must-have for Beatles fans also, they picked a great cast for the music.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|I recommend this movie highly, although certain historical criticisms apply. The essential truth is there: People with conscience (mostly white Christians)in England put it on-the-line to stop the slave trade to England, setting the example to follow for like-minded Americans. Good acting and drama from all involved. but the romantic diversion for Wilberforce seems awkward.  There are still slaves traded today in some parts of the world! The navel-gazers in America should look somewhere else to find fault instead of dwelling in the 18-19th centuries. Really examine, see how much better in every single way it is for people of all races and creeds here than the Islamic Middle East, or much of Africa.
B00132D808|3.0|To put it frankly... if you loved A Fever You Can't Sweat Out you're in for a complete 180. Not to say that the new album is bad or anything, it simply lives up to its name... Pretty. Odd. I was very excited by the first track which leads me to believe that I was listening to another great album filled with toe tappin' tunes and clever lyrics. After listening to the album a few times I was saddened that these guys had to abandon a great sound in order to copy a sound that has been done already. Though the music shows talent and writing skill, but it is a textbook example of a group that is trying way too hard to avoid the hole called the sophomore slump when they fall into another... Identity Crisis. I recommend that you find ways to hear this album before purchasing to avoid playing the disk and screaming WTF.
0810994739|5.0|I recommend that you should read this book because the hand written diary style fits in well with the pages of the book. He includes every day things like going to a party or swimming, but puts a humorous twist on it. Gregory's (the wimpy kid) older brother Rodrick who is a lazy under achiever is in a band that can't play. He is either making Gregory's life hell, or playing with his band in the basement. As well as having a teasing older brother he has a snitching younger brother called Manny who tells on him constantly. His best friend Rowley is a bit of an idiot and can be quite annoying he also knows something that Gregory doesn't want people to know, could his best friend tell?<br />Personally I think that Gregory is most certainly not a wimpy kid.

0671042858|3.0|I enjoyed this book and I wish that people who don't normally care for Mr. King would read this one.  This one is well written without the gore, terror and intensity that so many of us love.  ( myself included )  If I am being honest though I must say that my rating was probably a little affected by the Red Sox theme as I am a hard core YANKEES fan.  Even considering that I would recommend this one.

B00104QSOM|5.0|Actors can be divided up into two categories: Of coarse there are good actors. More interestingly, there are actors that are generally considered to be good, maybe really are good, and then the category in which Daniel Day-Lewis belongs.<br /><br />Indeed there is many a fine actor that has worked in the movies and are famous and loved for their great performances. Often these actors are always quite recognizable in whatever role, however different from the last, that we find them in. No doubt you can come up with your own very long list of these performers! I don't know that there is anything all that wrong with that. There is this much smaller group of performers out there that achieve what is actually the ultimate goal of their particular craft. These performers disappear into the role and what you see on the screen is only the character. Your attention goes to the character and to such an extent that you find yourself amazed that this is the same actor that you'd seen in previous roles.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis actually reminds me of the great director Stanley Kubrick. They are masters of their art. You could at times not help but wish they'd give us more in terms of their output because they're just so damn good -- and by *good* I mean about as perfect as a person can be in doing what they do. You realize though, that your maybe getting a little greedy because when they worked they put *everything* they had into it. Kubrick is gone and we have to live with the fact that we'll not get anymore more Kubrick films. But in all probability we will see -albeit barely recognizably, Daniel Day-Lewis practicing his craft, taking the form of another  character.<br /><br />Watch MY LEFT FOOT, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, GANGS OF NEW YORK, THERE WILL BE BLOOD and tell me there is a better actor in the world now.

0739334085|5.0|Let me cite what Obama says in chapter one (typed from the audio book):  ___  And everywhere I went I get some version of the same two questions:    'Where did you get that funny name?'  And then: 'You seem like a nice enough guy. Why do you want to go into something dirty and nasty like politics?'    In response I would usually smile and nod and say that I understood the  scepticism, but that there was and always had been another tradition of  politics:  a tradition that stretched from the days of the countrys foundings to the glories of the civil rights movements. A tradition based on the simple idea, that we have a stake in each other, and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart.    And that if enough people believe in the truth of that proposition - and act on it - we might not solve every problem, but we can get something meaningful done.  ___  The remainder of the book is as impressive as this introduction. Read it!
0375846735|1.0|You'd think that after 10 years the publisher would have invested in a rewrite, lord knows that it would have taken that long to fix this beast.<br /><br />I had heard all the hype about these books and this volume in particular being anti-Catholic, etc, so rather than listening to the \\"do not read\\" uber religious chatter, I read all 3 books.<br /><br />Forget his agenda -- Phillip Pullman or whomever ghostwrote this book was a very lazy writer here, unlike in the earlier 2 volumes.  I was ready to quit after the first third of the Spyglass book out of boredom but was curious to hear how everything resolved.  He doesn't even follow his story telling rules which he expounded in his earlier volumes.  Basically he lies to the reader by promising something he doesn't deliver on.<br /><br />The big show was to be the death match b/w Lord Asriel and God,<br />tag teamed by Will \\"the Knife\\".<br /><br />I think Pullman's sendup to Armageddon into thin air was his way of saying that since Judeo/Christianity is a human invention, he didn't have to have a big fight to kill it off, that he could let it feebly fade away, which he did.  Almost like it wasn't worth writing any more about.<br /><br />As I trudged through the last book, the worlds and characters ended up being made out of and as important as cardboard.  Pullman would reiterate a lot of the same detail when describing the world(s) and it was totally amazing to me that Will knew which worlds to cut into ... especially given the infinite potential for connecting worlds.<br /><br />Contrast this to Tolkein, who spend most of his life not only further detailing his worlds, but inventing the mythos, language and geography as to be believable.<br /><br />Pullman's naming of the characters was particularly trite.<br />Lyra (\\"Liar, Liar\\", the harpie exclaimed).<br />Will ((free) will, the desire to accomplish a goal, such as using the knife)<br />Mary (archetypical female figure, 2nd Eve, Jesus' mother, tempter, a nun -- voice of the church and the now new way of thinking).<br />Lord Asriel (Israel, rising up)<br />Give me a break ....<br /><br />The various soliloquys were pandering and while I enjoyed thinking about some of the ideas, it was so heavy handed that I just had to wryly smile and wonder how the author could live with his lack of discipline in this work.<br /><br />The Mulefa world was god-awful boring and he could have covered the whole evolutionary piece in 1 chapter.  Mary's existence there and elsewhere seemed only to deliver the summary of a form of ethics w/o a god-head and how god-lessness does not equate to moral-lessness.<br /><br />There was a major logical inconsistency ... if there was no God or supernatural like beings, then how could the witches fly, how could the grey Purgatory exist, how could the Specters and harpies end up being?  For as much as the author attempts to justify everything through science, he didn't even bother to apply the same treatment to his fantasy trappings.  Goofy.<br /><br />I would rather have had this broken up into 2 books and him invested more time to bring this home.  The whole book reminds me of my 6 year old randomly and messily sketching out ream after ream of characters and worlds on scrap paper and just letting them lay all over the house.  Of course a 6 year old has to clean up his messes, but Pullman somehow got away w/ not doing the same.<br /><br />Free Choice is a cornerstone of Christianity and also in these books.  My only regret was that I chose to read them when I could have invested time reading books about evolution, history of religion or atheism for that matter rather than this tortured attempt at writing.<br /><br />For all you 5 star assigners (Pullman apologists), your zealous defenses  sound as narrow minded as the alleged narrow thinking religious folks that you are condemning ... this 3rd volume is weak writing no matter how you slice it -- even with a dull yet not so subtle knife.<br /><br />Read it foryourself if you've got free time to waste and form your own conclusion!  (Just make sure you don't waste your money and instead borrow from the library  : )rrow from the library  : )

0385338724|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Kinsella's shopaholic series, and with a little hesitation tried out her newest release.  As in her other series, I was sucked in by the realistic emotions and thoughts of her main character.  As you begin the book, you find the main character wakes up, has amnesia, and has lost the last three years of her life.  I loved watching her freak out over the perfect life she has seemed to move into, with her perfect new body, perfect new teeth, perfect new home, and perfect new husband!  You feel for her though as she tries to grasp what happened to the more \\"real\\" person she once was.  Even though I sometimes thought I knew what was going to happen, I appreciated being fooled by the varied ways Kinsella brought the story together.  I have to say, I want a sequel so that I know what happens once she puts her life back together!
B0010X745K|4.0|So, first of all, let me say that if you haven't seen this movie and don't want spoilers, you probably want to skip this review. The Mist is a very faithful adaptation of Stephen King's novella up until the ending. It's good, character-driven, popcorn entertainment that makes you wonder what you'd do if you were in that situation, until the ending comes along and truly blows your mind..   In a nutshell, a freak storm devastates a lakeside community in New England, and the next day the townsfolk are all at the supermarket collecting supplies. However, a strange mist appears and envelopes everything in its path. It isn't too long until the people in the market realize that hiding within the mist are hordes of prehistoric, Lovecraftian-type monsters. There's giant mosquito-like bugs with deadly stingers, giant spiders that spin webs of acid and lay their eggs in the cocooned bodies of their victims, giant tentacles, lobster-like things, and huge behemoths that wander around the countryside.   Anyways, as the fear inside the supermarket mounts, the battle lines get drawn between a religious fundamentalist woman who says that they are all experiencing God's punishment and the more rational, level-headed members of the group. Before too long, more people are drawn to the religious zealot out of fear, and begin demanding human sacrifce to appease the angry God who punishment they have wrought.   In the end, a group of brave people decide to clear out and leave the zealots to their fate. They drive for what seems like a long time through the mist, and when their car runs out of gas, they make a decision to kill themselves rather than face the painful death that the creatures in the mist can offer them. The problem with this plan is that the only gun they have has four bullets in it, and there are five of them. The protagonist shoots the other four in the head, including his only son, a young child. In his despair and grief, he stumbles outside the car and waits for themonsters to take him. Only the rumbling and noise we hear in the background turns out not to be the monsters at all, but rather the U.S. Army coming to the rescue. It's the least they can do considering they caused the problem in the first place by ripping a hole into another dimension which then came spilling out into our own, but I digress. If the poor man had waited only a few more minutes, or if their car had gone just a little farther, or...well, you get the idea. It's a real bummer of an ending, and it elevates this film from simple popcorn entertainment to one that leaves you seriously thinking and seriously disturbed. I'd say that not since the original Night of the Living Dead has a horror movie come up with an ending that is so shocking and so dark.    If you can handle the ending, you may very well like this film and appreciate it's boldness. In King's original story, there is no resolution. It ends with the characters still trying to find a way out of the mist, and the father hearing the word \\"hope\\" on the radio, implying that the world may not be finished yet. But we never get an answer to that question in the book. In the movie, we get what should be a happy ending. The army has come to save the day, the world has not been taken over by the mist, all should be well. Except all we're left with is the image of the luckless father screaming in agony over what he had just done. It didn't matter that he was rescued, his life is now pretty much over. He will live wondering \\"what if\\" for the rest of his life.   My attitude towards the ending is mixed. I admire it's boldness, it's willingness to challenge us and make us think. My problem with it isn't that it's dark and depressing. My problem is that I felt it was unrealistic. There is a scene after they have made their escape from the supermarket where they are passing numerous abandoned cars on the highway. I think it's a safe bet that some of those cars have gas in them, and given the circumstances of howthey were abandoned in the first place, it's possible that they might still have their keys in them too.  Why not at least try to get in one of them? I think a devoted, loving father like the man in this movie would exhaust all possibilities before resorting to killing his son and then himself. There's even a moment in the book where he discusses the possibility of going outside for some gas and the potential dangers in entails. But at least the book character was willing to try. In the movie, it's basically, well, we're out of gas, let's kill ourselves.   In the end, I felt they gave up too soon. Some people might say that that is a point the filmmakers are trying to make, about not giving up hope. About the frailty of human beings under stress, and about how we succumb to our fears too easily. But I don't buy it. I don't buy that they would give up so soon, not after everything we had already seen them do.   So, all in all, a good horror movie that makes you think. And even though I didn't like the conclusions that it drew, I applaud it for even making me think enough about it to write this rather long review. If you like scary movies and can handle depressing endings, then definitely give this one a shot.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|Too many highlights to list them all here. It's a shame that Paul Di'Anno chose partying over significance, but Bruce Dickinson is a much stronger performer and frontman, so everybody won (except, of course, Di'Anno).    \\"Beast Over Hammersmith\\" is unbelievably raw and vital, and it doesn't let up. The performance of \\"The Prisoner\\" is a real jaw-dropper...the band just CRANKS.    I'm glad that we have the Dickinson lineup of Maiden still rocking in 2008, but this DVD gives you a rare glimpse into the history of a band who set out to conquer the world...and DID.

0743486285|5.0|This book is an eye opening look into addiction. I was blown away by some of the first hand accounts of Nikki's struggle with substance abuse. If you take nothing from this book except how hard it is to struggle with your inner demons and kick the habit of drugs and drinking than that is enough. This book is like a warning sign to all those that are thinkin of/or have already started down the path of substance abuse.
B000J0UD94|5.0|This is my favourite movie. Hated by the critics, derided on grounds of puny political correctness, and on Depardieu's strangled English, the film has enormous failings. It's at least 45 minutes too long, the plot lines meander, dialogue is creaky and the ending is anticlimacteric. The perfunctory nod to political correctness didn't help either. (Neither did Sigourney Weaver as an unlikely Catherine of Aragon in a post Aliens role)  And yet.. this is a fabulous movie. Depardieu eschews all sissy \\"method acting\\" and takes the role of Columbus by the scruff of the neck. He dominates the screen without needing to act. But it's the sheer loveliness of the movie that makes you gasp- every frame is a deliciously composed Ridleygram- who could forget the spectacle of an ancient caravel full sail between two steamy tropical islets, or the clip of overdressed functionaries in tiny landing craft, pennents and banners aloft, about to land on the New World. The fantastic score by Vangelis sets the atmosphere throughout. It's a feast for the eye even at every viewing- this is what movie making should be about; it's what sets film apart as a separate art form.
159102594X|5.0|Told from multiple points of view, The Blade Itself is very much a character study, yet it reads like fast-action pulp.  Each character can be summarily described by a D&D character sheet, yet Abercrombie takes all of your fantasy cliches and dumps them by the wayside, bloody and battered.    This is simply the best fantasy I've read since discovering Scott Lynch.
0061186422|5.0|This collection, like Smoke and Mirrors before it, is both a wonderful introduction to Neil Gaiman and a delightful treat for those who already know him.  The short stories collected here are not all brand new (Chivalry, Troll Bridge), but there's some 2006 and 2007 short stories you may not have read before.<br /><br />Regardless, the tone and style provides a great example of this master writer's skill and range.

B00104QSOM|5.0|Film is quite an interesting art form. At times it can show quite alot on screen and say absolutely nothing, sometimes it can show very little on screen but make what little that is say quite a bit. Sometimes film can take a fairly simple premise of an oil tycoon trying to rise in his business and make something of true artistic value. But it doesn't only take reels of a film, it also takes a well rounded full plot to give the film the substance it needs to be true art.<br /><br />Let me begin with the character of Daniel Plainview; within the first few scenes, which are almost completely silent, Daniel Day-Lewis has transformed into a desperate, poor gold miner trying to make something of his life. Then that character is taken to be the working man, just trying to make a living. With a steady pace into the future, you find a wealthy, upper-class entrepreneur. But throughout the film, as his social status and wealth grew higher, the character that is truly inside him has grown lower and lower; he is never satisfied, and doesn't know how to satisfy himself other than trying to buy more land and creating a monopoly for himself. But as he buys more land and further builds his empire, his character sinks lower and lower. Daniel Plainview is a truly developed character in a film which is, essentially, a character study. This enough makes the film an intellectual fiesta. I could go into further analysis of this character, but I would be giving far too much away.<br /><br />Johnny Greenwood's score is fantastic; combined with the masterful cinematography, it is very well part of the story. As Daniel builds his first well in California, cheerful music plays which fools the audience into thinking this is a good thing, as Daniel has fooled the residents into thinking what he was doing was good.<br /><br />All this combined creates a simply majestic story which can be rivaled by only a few films. I can imagine 20 years into the future; this will be among the few films from this decade that will be discussed at film schools across the nation.<br /><br />(p.s. Like No Country For Old Men, there has been quite a bit of speculation about the ending of this film; some were confused, some were annoyed, some were unsatisfied; if you ask me, it had to end this way, and this truly was the perfect ending for this film; for people saying it was a terrible ending, how else would you have it end?)scussed at film schools across the nation.

0151013047|2.0|Without doubt this book has an intriguing plot, however it the writing that lets it down. The book is in the form of a first-person narrative, but is so  amateurish and so jarring that I had to struggle to hold on to the plot. The writing really put me off.    The book begins in a cafe in Lahore, Pakistan where the narrator who is Pakistani is telling his story to an American visitor.   I also got the feeling that the author also shares some of the \\"hatred and despise\\" that the protagonist is supposed to have. There was a line in the book where the narrator asks the American guy if he has a lover back home \\"male/female\\". While to a western audience this may seem a non-issue, homosexuality is still considered taboo in South Asia. Only a South Asian reader can detect the mock in this line. The same question posed to the narrator would have been considered offensive! Maybe is wasn't the narrator, it was the author mocking the Americans.  In my opinion, the praise lavished on this book is out of a sense of being politically correct.
B000002H6C|5.0|Another great metallica release. songs are long and drawn out,but that's what makes it great.\\"Justice\\" though, once it captures you, will never let you go. The lyrics are meaningful, poetic and very intelligent. The music is very raw and powerful stuff- fantsatic guitars and drums. Songs on this album go from being melodic to down right energetic. Hetfield's voice adds to the atmosphere of energy. The album is dark but also uplifting in it's power and energy.
0141301104|5.0|I really love this book. It's basically a book for children or young adults but I don't care. Ronald Dahl is such a vivid writer who is very descriptive and thought-provoking. This book's almost like a sci-fi fairytale. I still love \\"The Witches\\" because it was one of my very favorite books as a child. And what's wrong with that? People hold close their favorite movies or television programs as youngsters, why not books, too? There should be a new section of books, comfort reading. If you liked the book, I also recommend the movie as well. Remember, only bad witches are ugly!

0691131511|4.0|This not a history of the Byzantine Empire - rather it's a series of essays on different aspects of the Byzantine Empire with an overriding defensive attitude about the derogatory way the empire has been portrayed throughout history.  The idea, apparently, is to try to present the important facets or characteristics of the empire in such a way that perhaps people who would not be interested in a straight history of the subject might be challenged to read about it, and change the attitude, which still prevails to a large extent, that there wasn't much to admire or even be interested in about the late Roman Empire which was ruled from Constantinople from the fourth to the fifteenth centuries.  Basically, it's a highbrow Complete Idiot's Guide to the Byzantine Empire.   That having been said, I like the strategy and I like the book.  By skipping the chronological history of the empire (which at 1100 years takes a while to tell and buries anything really interesting) it picks and chooses aspects of the history, telling you why the empire was important.  Whether it was Hagia Sophia, or iconoclasm, or eunuchs, or the siege of 1453, the two dozen or so things that are important are highlighted and given a chance to breathe.  My favorite (largely I think because of the music) history of Byzantium is still John Romer's TV series from about 1998, but this book adds quite a bit to it by providing if less poetic, more persuasive analysis of many issues.   For example, I never really understood before what the driving force behind iconoclasm was - Romer makes it seem just another random bizarre theological dispute - something the Byzantines were always prone to.  Its advocates' motives are never really explained, and it's presented largely as the sort of tyrannical invasion on freedom of worship that we can be expected to abhore.  Herrin, however, explains that it arose when the empire was sustaining repeated military defeats, and since God obviously would not allow his chosen to be defeated, there had to be some reason behind it - something the Byzantines were doing that they were being punished by God for.  The emperor eventually decided that it had to be divine displeasure with the common practice of venerating or \\"worshiping\\" idols, which did admittedly have strong roots in pagan practice.  From their perspective, iconoclasm made perfect sense as an attempt to get back into God's good graces.  Far from a tyrannical whim, it was, from their perspective a responsible, and even a courageous act.  All in all, a good book, and a good addition to my growing library on Byzantium.

0143038419|5.0|I definitely recommend Eat Pray Love.  I found it to be delightful, humorous, and touching.  The journey of a woman to find her solid ground and love after her life had been shook by tremors.... it's a novel that every woman can relate to.  I actually gifted this book to about 5 people for Christmas, and they too are loving it!    I just loved the style of her writing.... her jokes were hilarious!  A success.  Buy this book and make your own decision.     I promise you won't be disappointed.
B000002HMH|5.0|i like all metallica cd's some better than others - some worse , but still like them all. outside of SANITARUM off of PUPPETS my fav METALLICA song has always been AIN'T MY B*TCH.this album is more or less a continuation of where they were headed with the BLACK ALBUM.It really gets old when I hear so called Metallica \\"fans\\" spouting on about how bad this album is and how they haven't made a decent one since Master Of Puppets and how the band have been crap ever since Cliff died and blah blah blah. It gets very monotonous. The truth is, if you were a true fan (you don't have to love everything they've produced) but you'd stick by them and acknowledge that they've gone through different stages and have had to adjust accordingly. That's what Load is. It's different and it's a reflection on where the band were in the nineties. It's not \\"metal up your ass\\" like Kill 'em all and it hasn't got the power of Master of puppets but it's still a  good record - packed with a mix of very good rock songs (Until It Sleeps) and a few deeper, softer tunes (Hero Of the Day, Mama Said)...all brilliant to listen to and distinctly Metallica.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I have to admit, the second season of \\"Lost\\" is pretty hard to review.  Thing is, its pretty much the same animal as the [[ASIN:B00005JNOG first season]].  The only difference is that there's more characters involved and the mystery just keeps growing.  The basic conclusion I've come to is that anyone who enjoyed the places that the story was taken to in the first season will be pleased with this season.    Those who criticize this show as never solving the many mysteries that create the backbone of \\"Lost\\" are very simply wrong.  This season answers more in the first episode than you'd expect would happen until episode twelve.  Throughout the season, you'll find out answers to questions such as this:    + What is in the mysterious hatch?  What does it have to do with the island, and what makes Locke think his fate is inside this hatch?    + What ever happened to the tail section of the plane?  Was Rose right to have faith that her husband (who was in the tail section) is alive, or are they all dead?    + What happened to Claire when she was kidnapped?  Was it the Others that let her go and, if so, why?  Or did she escape on her own?    + Is there more significance to Hurley's 'lotto numbers' than everyone seems to believe?    Those who weren't convinced by the first season of \\"Lost\\" won't find many differences between this season and the first.  There are still a lot of mysteries by the time this season finishes--if there weren't, it wouldn't be \\"Lost\\"--but the creative force behind this show gives us just enough to keep us satisfied.  As far as I'm concerned, \\"Lost\\" is one of the best acted, best written, and best directed series on television.  It's visually astonishingly... and it also knows how to play your heartstrings.  It may not have been the best show of the year--that goes to [[ASIN:B000FL7CAK Veronica Mars]], which \\"Lost\\" fans would very much enjoy--but it easily makes any television fan's top five of the '05-'06 season.    9/10

Being lost in a bureaucratic maze is a theme that Kafka has milked to perfection before, as it was also used in his other novels, \\"Metamorphosis,\\" in particular.<br /><br />Once he is arrested, the \\"bill of particulars\\" of the crime for which he is \\"being held over\\" for is never given to him; no judgment is made against him; he waits interminably to be seen by the courts but only tricky lawyer appear to give him information that invariably is useless to his case. His frustration mounts but is never completely resolved. Until in the end, where a priests offers him a parable about a man who waits his whole life to enter the doorway of the law, K seems completely lost. He interprets the parable to mean that the state itself is but one big lie made into the rule of the world.<br /><br />The novel is scary in the almost imperceptible and seamless way that the faceless state apparatus snags, sucks one into, and then takes over, and entraps Mr. K's life. Kafka makes it seem that it is possible for it to happen to any one in almost any society, including in our \\"so-called\\" safe democracy. All one has to do is look at what has happened to many of the innocent people arrested as \\"suspected terrorists,\\" and who were not allowed to contact their families or see lawyers, some of whom are still kept incommunicado even today. It is a cautionary tale that freedom must be defended everyday, and then defended some more.<br /><br />Five starsmust be defended everyday, and then defended some more.<br /><br />Five stars
B000002H33|5.0|The cd all metallica fanboys wish all metallica cd's sounded like- reguardless, still a great cd -no fan of hard rock/heavy metal. This genre of music has produced some excellent, adrenaline-pumping metal, but it can also produce an array of over-complex and sketchy music. However, 'Master of Puppets' gives you everything you could possibly want from a thrash metal CD. The complexity of each song is incredible, yet the music still retains a radio-friendly sound. Don't get me wrong, this is 'thrash' in it's purest form, but Metallica's music is deceptively catchy. Very rarely do you get such an aggressive sound which is kind on the ear. 'Disposable Heroes' is an utter masterpiece of rhythm, speed and texture - words can't describe the sheer variety within the song. Other classics include 'Damage INC.', 'Battery', 'Master of Puppets' and 'Leper Messiah'.
1570628033|5.0|This fictional account of a young Indian nobleman's journey to enlightenment became the 1960's radicals Manifesto and Handbook. Whether intended to or not, this book along with another by Hesse, his \\"Steppenwolf,\\" written the same year, and \\"The Tales of Don Juan\\" by Carlos Castenada, ushered in the era of the hippies, recreational drug use, and the \\"Beat\\" generation in the U.S. And while they all had a distinctively Buddhist flavoring, worldview and outlook to them, together they changed not just the U.S. but a large part of the thinking of the youth of the Western world.<br /><br />The story is set in the sixth century, the era when Buddha himself is believed to have lived. After many years of living a worldly life as a trader, and a father, Siddartha began his search for enlightenment in earnest. As is the case with Don Juan, Siddartha's journey is an inner solitary one, an attempt, as it were, to use his maturity and awareness of the world to gain better insight and awareness of himself and to better understand how he fits into the world around him.<br /><br />At the end of the novel he is captain of a small boat where he sees the river on which he traveled as an allegory of the passage of life's cycles from birth to death, and thorough various other phases of life. The ultimate goal of awareness and the ultimate message of the book are to become one with the cycles of the universe. His search ends with the understanding that we are all part of the same oneness, whether it is called god or just the universe or the cosmos: Change does not matter nearly as much as the fact that we are all connected.<br /><br />It is a good and uplifting message.<br /><br />Five stars.

B000001FY9|5.0|Bob Marley & The Wailers-Legend *****<br /><br />Well when Bob Marley & The Wailers' albums are placed up against other albums from their time, or genre, or period for that matter, they seem to be better, this greatest hits collection is the same but only up against other hit collections.<br /><br />It shows all the things that The Wailers did in their short time with Marley to bring Reggae to the masses. This really instilled reggae in America. The English always knew about it but it wasn't until songs like 'I Shot The Sheriff' 'Waiting In Vain' and the epic 'Exodus' that reggae became recognized as a true musical form.<br /><br />Singing songs of Praise, songs of change, of acceptance, of the downtrodden, of love and friendship, and of faith, Marley was true, honest, and more importantly rare, and this collection is a sad reminder of what we lost far too soon, and far too fast.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Great Collection of high quality nature oriented programming. My friends  couldn't  wait to watch it with me.
B00005KB9R|5.0|Bob Marley & The Wailers-Burnin' *****<br /><br />Released in 1973, the same year as the bands debut Catch A Fire was released, and while many consider one significantly greater then the other, which varies who you ask, I must say they both go hand in hand. Catch A Fire and this, Burnin' are sort of like a ying, and yang thing, not to sound too cliche. Catch A Fire seems to be more about peace and togetherness while Burnin' is the opposite spectrum, more empowering, and more about overcoming and getting yours. Marley was always an activist through his lyrics, you could say he was to reggae what Johnny Cash was to country as far as civil justice and spirituality is concerned.<br /><br />Containing two of the groups biggest hits, the great opener 'Get Up, Stand Up' and the immortal 'I Shot The Sheriff' which is far better then the Clapton cover, and also shows the vicious side of Marleys lyrics. But it's 'Rasta Man Chant' 'Small Axe' 'Pass It On' and the vehement 'Burnin And Lootin' that make this album a classic.<br /><br />The new release of the album contains three bonus tracks. 'Reincarnated Souls' being the best, and one that would have perfectly complimented the original album. The other two being less impressive but still great, 'No Symphony' and the chilling 'The Oppressed Song.'<br /><br />After Burin' Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh would both leave to form solo projects, Tosh being the most successful of the two. His album Legalize It is another classic. The departure of those two members would forever change the sound of the band. They would aim for a more commercial appeal while that isn't a bad thing it did seem to loose something. Though I did enjoy the later background vocals they were not as good as the first two albums, and neither was the musicianship which is something Burnin' has an amazing amount of. Burnin' is an album which I would recommend to anyone who is interested in more then Bob Marley & The Wailers hits.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I have used Amazon and their distributors on many occasions, and I have always been quite satisfied. My purchases, including this one, arrive on time and in the conditon that I expect...good. I also appreciate the low prices that amazon offers. I will continue to use their services and would recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a book or cd.
B00005KB9T|5.0|The opening to the first track on the album 'Concrete Jungle' is sort of a metaphor for the groups career with Marley. They slowly gained power and notoriety then exploded for a seemingly long groove then came to a sudden stop. 'Concrete Jungle' sets the pace for the rest of the album which happens to be the groups first. This is the ying to the yang that was the bands second album Burnin.' While that album was much darker and angrier Catch A Fire is more about peace and togetherness.<br /><br />Songs like the opener, along side 'Slave Driver' and 'No More Trouble' are the kind of classic social commentary Marley became known for in his lyrics. The hit 'Stir It Up' along side 'Kinky Reggae' and 'Baby We've Got A Date' show a different side however, they show the lover that Marley was and his love for women.<br /><br />The over all music on Catch A Fire is among the best Bob Marley & The Wailers ever released, if not the best. The musicianship of Tosh and Bunny Wailer propel this from just a good album to a masterpiece of reggae music. Sadly those two would leave the Wailers after the next album Burnin' drastically changing the bands sounds forever. The band went on to massive popularity with their later releases such as Uprising and Exodus but it is Catch A Fire that remains Marley & The Wailers' best and most consistent album.
1400097029|4.0|Only this month have I had a chance to read John Banville's The Sea.   I had been waiting for the proper moment to read it, something like a quiet, rainy weekend, for I have been acquainted with some of his earlier works --  which I truly enjoyed - and I knew how reflexive his style was.  I rightly imagined it would require my undivided attention and careful reading.   In addition I confess that I came to this book with great expectations:  I am a lover of English books and have systematically been in agreement with the Man Booker prize selections and winners for several years.     I first got acquainted with John Banville's work in the late 80s, when I had the opportunity to spend a couple of years in Europe.  At that time John Banville was not as well known a writer and I had that delightful feeling of \\"discovering a new talent that no one else knew about.\\"  Of course he had already been well discovered, but among my group of friends I was the first.  My introduction to his work was Newton's Letter, which, though a small masterpiece, gave me the opportunity to brag about his talents with friends.  He had won me over.  I then read Kepler and later on I read The Book of Evidence.  Since neither of the last two compared with Newton's Letter, I took a vacation from his work for I feared I had just overdosed on the writer.    So I was doubly disappointed after finishing The Sea.  First, for disagreeing with the 2005 choice of the Man Booker prize.  Not that Banville didn't deserve it.  Of course he did; but not for this book.  Second, I was disappointed with the book itself, whose narrative I found to be self-indulgent and manipulative, despite the beautifully crafted language.  I thought the story rather common, with foreseeable consequences and I felt that the narrator was deliberately circuitous, his stream-of-consciousness style a mere excuse to transform what should have been a short story into a small novel.      Of course John Banville is a fine craftsman and great master of the English language, which he has always used with precision and this novel is no exception. There are throughout the text precious phrases, poetic pearls, clever observations that could easily outlast the book.   Not known for particularly endearing characters, John Banville in this novel has given time and space to a despicable main narrator; something that further distanced me from the pure enjoyment of his style.  He is still, however, an excellent writer despite all his efforts to antagonize the reader with his characters.  It becomes impossible therefore not to give him four out of a maximum of five stars.  But I would not recommend this book as an introduction to Banville's work.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|Although different than his other movies, Will Ferrell is a great actor in Stranger than Fiction. His character is really boring, and I think anyone knows someone who is similar to his character. This movie has a more broad spectrum audience than his other more silly movies. Anyone will like it; it is a cute movie with many other stars including Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah.

I would have liked to have been there are the time, but this performance puts you right there and you are part of it.  There's something about a live concert that makes it a simply joyous affair.  Attending a live concert on DVD is a great way to spend an evening. I loved every one of these singers and they just get better as the performance goes on. Note: The Picture Format is 16:9, not 1:33 and fills up your Widescreen.

I don't know how anyone can really awaken to their life's purpose either...unless friends, family, co-workers, lovers and enemies slap them in the face and set out a plan in their face.

0141182865|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. I f I ever wrote a book, I would want it to be this one. I have been buying copies since I first read it in New Orleans in 1980. A must-have for anyone who loves a great laugh!
0060557818|5.0|My brother gave me this book for christmas and said that some of his friends recomended the author. After starting this book I found that I was greatly enjoying it. Although it was sometimes difficult to keep the realities that they were in straight. Neverwhere is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Having been to London and having been in the area that the book takes place in made it especially appealing to me. The imagery that he uses throughout the book is exceptional. He weaves together a story that keeps you glued to the pages. After having read this book I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read an amazing book.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I recently watched this film intending to view an episode at a time. I did not expect to watch the entire film in one sitting but that is just what I did!    The acting was incredible and Richard Armitage's John Thornton is up there with Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy. I enjoyed the strong heroine Margaret played by Daniela Denby-Ashe. The story was absolutely compelling.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film! I strongly recommend it!
B0013FBS20|3.0|The other reviews capture some of the pitfalls of this movies that I would want to echo.  Will Smith gives an excellent performance but as he started to talk to mannequins I started to loose the character.  The zombies of the original movies were not monsters that could perform amazing feats (walk on ceilings, etc.) and this movie should have stuck to what was possible. It started to loose me at the end.
B0012YYZYK|4.0|UPDATE: This flaw was corrected in a silent replacement of the title.  It took over a year for Warner to fix it, but they did fix it.  I have changed my rating of the disc as a result.  I realize some were not happy I was critical of this because the gap is only 7 seconds, but a 7 second dropout during a drum solo is pretty bad IMO.  Some also may not have experienced the glitch due to getting a fixed copy (again, a year after release) or were not streaming TrueHD.<br /><br />Anyway, good that the glitch is fixed, however it would have been better if Warner had an official replacement program instead of just silently fixing the problem in an unlabelled 2nd pressing.<br /><br />BELOW IS ORIGINAL REVIEW TEXT:<br /><br />Unfortunately the Blu-ray version of this concert has a 7-second long sound dropout in the TrueHD soundtrack at timecode 1:40:45 - all copies of the Blu-ray currently available are affected.  The TrueHD soundtrack of the previously released HD DVD does not suffer from this dropout (nor does the Blu-ray's lower quality DD soundtrack), so it is clear this was an encoding goof-up on Warner's part.<br /><br />This type of QC problem is unacceptable for a product that costs $20, yet Warner has not mentioned any intention of fixing the issue.  Hopefully they get on the ball and set up a replacement program for those who buy this defective disc.<br /><br />Note that the recent re-release of this disc still suffers from the dropout problem.  Maybe the third time will be the charm... :\
B000R7HY0K|5.0|The dialogue so rich and fulfilling typical Quentin tarantino, the action over the top and just awesome all around.  The violence sickening and shocking.  I am in awe this is yet another example of great directing prowess and smart writing skills.  Throw in...legendary...cult classic...I am crying at this point.  To watch this movie you have to be smart and witty to catch the jokes...too much to ask?  Then go watch Alvin and the Chipmunks then you pansy...this is for grown folk.

The characters were fabulous. Thank you Robin Williams, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Freddie Highmore.    I need to review the name of the artists who created the music for August Rush but now I need to own the sound track. WOW, fabulous guitar (and cello) music! I love to hear about new Keri Russell projects so keep 'em coming Keri!     And .. Happy 32nd Birthday!
B0010X745K|4.0|This film is chilling and a superb horror film from all the crap from past years.  I enjoyed the whole aspect of myst with something hiding inside that is killing people...awesome premise.  The crazy bible-wielding hag who is calling for blood gets her due...brilliant.  The creatures who are by the way terrifying (I couldn't get to sleep at night)...same on the director for scaring me.  So with that said I am going to say...creatures again?  I thought that what was in the Myst was cool, menacing, not freaking bugs.  The ending was vicious in it's execution, cruel, chilling, reminded me of the punisher. Look, I apologize I was going to give it a three but it is a four star review.  This is a great horror film and it deserves praise.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|This was a great great album!  It is one that you can insert heavily in your rotation for a long time and not get tired of it.  I catch myself thinking \\"I really like this song\\" and then I realize that I am saying that at one time or another about every song on the album.  I am impressed!!  If you like artists like Andrew Bird or Josh Ritter you will probably like this album.  I think it is a classic and one that I will continue to listen to for a long time to come.  I highly recommend this album.
B000ZN802W|3.0|I have a brother with a wild spirit who once took off on a hitchhiking trip from Ca. to Montana. He was 17 at the time. He's 52 now and hasn't changed much, but takes his wife in tow and instead of his thumb, has chosen rental cars and airplanes.   The young man in \\"into the Wild\\" was looking for something in himself, but he forgot to watch along the way. He missed seeing all the love, the admiration, the need that others have and instead, chose to seek only for his own gratification. It's life's journey that makes this life worth living. It's others that we allow into our lives that complete us. And it was difficult to feel anything for the movie's subject, since he hurt a lot of people along his path to self discovery. Had he lived to be an old man, he would have learned that we are \\"herd\\" animals, and is we stray too far from the herd, we are alone....eternally.   This was a profound story and I recommend either reading the book or buying the video, but expect to feel empty when the story ends.
B000063DFQ|5.0|One doesn't have to say much about the \\"Piece\\" - it's just Maiden at their best. Besides famous hits like The Trooper and Flight of Icarus especially Die with Your Boots On is my favourite song when I have a difficult piece of work to complete. Because this Piece of Mind adds energy and joy to MY mind.    The only poor but neglectible thing is, that the \\"Special Multimedia Section\\" isn't running on my PC, for me that's irrelevant, as I'm rather a listener than a watcher of CD's, but those, who want to watch should ensure that they will be capable to.
0452289963|3.0|This is not a book I would have chosen on my own.  It needs to be read slowly & at times, I had to re-read paragraphs to completely understand what the author is trying to convey. Since I haven't finished it yet I'll reserve a recommendation but to date, there's enough food for thought to keep me reading.
B00132D808|4.0|If you are expecting 'A fever you can't sweat out 2', DO NOT buy this album.  This is totally new, refreshing, and has the right qualities to make this one a classic.  With such poppy, easy listening sounds of 'A fever', in my opinion, it was really easy to enjoy, but impossible to enjoy for an extended period of time.  This new album takes a few listens before you finally get it, but once you do, it makes it all worth it.  With a hint of 'A Fever', and a hint of the Beatles, and mostly a new style, it makes this album very enjoyable.  I would recommend this album to anybody who was a fan of 'A Fever', but who is also willing to not hear what they expect.  You need to throw your expectations out the window and listen to this album with a clear mind.  You will not be disappointed.
B00005MP58|5.0|There are  many versions of Pride & Prejudice.  This one is the best.  Excellent quality (HD DVD player).  Although I haven't seen all of the previous versions, and having just reread the book, this version is very true to the original text, with lengthy quotes from the book.  Darcy is enhanced for the ladie's sake, and I freely admit I now have a thing for Colin Firth.
1577314808|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Eckhardt Tolle's The Power of Now.   In a clear and engaging manner, Tolle provides the fundamentals of spiritual enlightenment and answers the questions most commonly asked by those learning to be present in their lives.  The book provides a great foundation for getting into the current moment and noticing the ways the mind can easily take you away from where you are.  While reading The Power of Now, I discovered many ways in which my mind resists the current moment, or what is.      Two other books I found to be incredibly inspirational and supportive are [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]] and [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]], both by Ariel and Shya Kane.  In contrast to Tolle's focus on spiritual enlightenment, the Kanes take an anthropological approach to living life directly in the moment and dissolving life-long mechanical behaviors.  I recommend all three books: The Power Of Now, Working On Yourself Doesn't Work and Being Here, to anyone who is interested in enlightenment and experiencing a magical life.

B000P0J09W|5.0|A while back I bought this movie for a friend of mines, four year old daughter. It was such a success, that I decided this time around to buy it for my own three year old. I figured he may be a little too young, but sometimes, for my own sake, I need to put on something different than the usual cast of cartoons. Within the first five minutes of the film, I thought I was in trouble when Chunk drops the S-H bomb, and my three year old instantly repeated it. At which point his mother yelled from the other room...  \\"did he just say...?\\"  I quickly dodged that bullet though, and, am pleased to say, that the kid really dug the film.  As for me, I find this film to be as enjoyable now, as I ever have. I don't really know why for sure, but I always feel like I did the first time around (was probably seven or eight) digging this cool adventure, where little Mikey gets to make out with Andi. Oh yeah Andi. She could be part of my group of Goonies anyday...I'd be like \\"F*** this inhaler!\\"<br />The bonus features also include the two part video from Cyndi Lauper, which is absolutely a treat, ...even for the kids. It has a few of Cyndis wrestling buddies, Captain Lou, Roddy Piper, and Andre The Giant, as well as a few other familiar faces, in a fun, two part serial, Cyndi Lauper type twist on the Goonies story. Which, probably could have developed into a popular Saturday Morning cartoon if you ask me... Pretty cool.  I recommend this, again, for a good family viewing... just explain to your kids if they are real young, that Sloth is a good guy, and be sure to cuff the ears when Chunk spills his ICEE during the opening credits... K?

0452286751|5.0|Brilliance  I first received The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand as an English assignment for class.  Seeing that it consisted of approximately 700 pages, the dreadful task of reading it came to mind.  However, after my teacher shared with the class her views upon this book and how insightful it will be to us, I was a little interested but still put it off.  How interesting could a book be that is 700 pages long (with the exception of Harry Potter)?  To my surprise, within the first twenty-five pages, I was hooked to the lengthy novel.  Ayn Rand is able to paint a vivid picture for the imagination of the characters, setting, emotions, and context.  In the novel, she clearly states her opinion of the essence of an ego within an individual through her main character Howard Roark; he is the great architect who lives for no one but himself.  Although he is intriguing, other characters interested me; Peter Keating, a parasitic human being whose creativity consists of nothing more than the copying of others for his \\"originality\\"; Dominique Francon, the beautiful woman whose will to love none is disbarred with her meeting of Roark; Ellsworth Toohey, the antagonist of the story who appears to be great with his \\"selfless\\" acts but only seeks power; and Gail Wynand, one who worked his way from the slums for control but loses himself along the way, until the very end.  These characters keep me entertained throughout the story of Roark's perseverance as an architect and his ability to express his individualism.  Even though this book is based upon the great work of an architect, when I looked deeper within Ayn Rand's words, I understand the philosophical statement behind the buildings and people.  This book is enjoyable from beginning to end, and my teacher is right: this book is insightful and gives people a reason and hope as to why they should always be true to themselves.  After reading 700 pages, I decided that I love Ayn Rand's philosophy within the words and the moral behind the story.  The Fountainhead is one of brilliance and remembrance.
B000ZN802W|5.0|It is difficult to speak negatively about a guy who is portrayed with such likable attributes as Chris McCandless. Truthfully speaking though you can both like AND dislike certain qualities in a single individual, though you may like them in general, even admiring them - and McCandless is no exception here.<br /><br />To those who've seen 'Grizzly Man' there is no denying the emotional similarities of Chris McCandless and Timothy Treadwell. I won't go into great detail concerning Treadwell's story, suffice to say that Treadwell and McCandless both turned their backs (or wanted to) on society, which they both disdained as well. Both sought escape in the Alaskan wilderness, Treadwell at Katmai National Park, and McCandless in the Alaskan interior. Both displayed reckless behavior, and in the end died because of it! To be fair, of the two Treadwell is the most obviously nuts.<br /><br />Conversely McCandless seems like a relatively sane, immensely likable fellow, albeit extremely impulsive. Impulsiveness aside I had no problem with most of his adventures - until he crosses over into Alaska! At this point I have to ask myself how could a guy read Jack London and NOT be more respectful of the Alaskan wilderness? McCandless' decision to trek into the interior of Alaska with just the barest of necessities showed just how delusional this young man was. This guy thought he could somehow beat the odds with just a knife and a bic lighter, and lost! Like Treadwell, McCandless died an early, senseless, death.

B000LPS3B2|3.0|First off, let me say I believe I'm the victim of being too hyped up for this film. You know how someone says, \\"You want to hear a hilarious joke?\\" Then when you hear the joke it's not as funny as if they just would have told you the joke first.<br /><br />Anticipation ruins jokes just as it does horror films. I heard from numerous people this was one of the scariest films out of Asia and sadly I have to beg to differ. Although in all fairness, I guess by default, I would have to say it's the scariest out of Thailand (as no others come to mind). I'm just getting tired of seeing the same creepy-crawly Ringu girl in every film as of late.<br /><br />All ranting aside, I wont bother to create another plot synopsis as many other reviewers have already done that part. I'll be brief as I don't want the viewer to anticipate any scenes.<br /><br />Downsides-<br />Poor picture quality (reminiscent of a bad soap opera episode).<br />Not enough effective lighting (personally I like my horror films to have that generally dark feel to them).<br />Much like this one, too many films are capitalizing off of the creepy Ringu-girl.<br />Fairly predictable but definitely not 100% predictable.<br /><br />Upsides-<br />Decent plot (with exception to the *main \\"picture\\"* scene, that didn't make sense to me).<br />Some genuinely good creep-outs.<br />I really liked the general idea of the movie.<br />The closing scene was very good.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Shutter\\" was a decent movie. I never got bored or felt that the film was dragging on. It may have been better had I not expected so much. It's not that \\"Shutter\\" was a bad film, it just wasn't fantastic. If I were going to recommend an Asian horror, I'd still have to say the original [[ASIN:B000E0OE4O Pulse]] is my favorite.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie was excellent and the condition it came in was great.  I have absolutely no issues, and it came in a timely manner! Also cheaper then some stores locally!

B000X418UE|4.0|What a great film. The star of the show is the role played by Sean Connery. Great copy of the film on Blu Ray. Great to able to watch this US Blu Ray disc on European Blu Ray players.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I love this movie. My daughter-in-law loves this movie. My son loves this movie. It's just too much fun to miss. Others have already waxed poetic about the acting, writing, etc., so I won't repeat. Let me just say that only a scrooge wouldn't enjoy it. I know a few of those, but I wouldn't try to watch a feel-good movie with them anyway. Otherwise, I highly recommend it, and not just at Christmas. (So, why did I rate it only 4 stars? Simply because I save the 5-star ratings for movies I consider classics, such as 'Casablance,' the original Star Wars trilogy (4-6), BBC's 'The Blue Planet' documentary, etc.)
B000068IEU|3.0|I remember as a teenager me and my buddies used to check out the latest slasher flicks du jour.  These flicks were pretty generic and formulaic with the possible exception of John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\".  The plots usually consisted of placing a group of teens in a remote setting and watching the most promiscuous ones systematically get picked off by a demented and/or deformed psycho.  Usually the lone survivor was the group virgin.  \\"The Last House on the Left\\" doesn't deviate much from this formula.  Instead of sex our unsuspecting teens are in search of marijuana and they have the misfortune of trying to score from a group of escaped psychotics.  Having come out in 1972, there's not much to distinguish this flick from those that followed.  Our young unfortunates are subsequently raped, tortured and subjected to other deviant behaviors.  The difference here is the perpetrators aren't faceless hockey-masked lunatics.  And comeuppance is dished out in the end.  Despite this being a low budget affair director Wes Craven at times does display some semblance of artistry.  In the end, though, you say so what because this is still a slasher flick.
B00009ATIX|4.0|If you haven't watched the film yet, you probably won't want to read this review. I'm going to get into spoilers and meanings and demystify the ending for you.<br /><br />Kelvin (played by Clooney) is a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist (not really sure, but it doesn't matter) who is sent to a space ship that is docked near a planet named Solaris to determine what has happened to the crew and if the mission can be salvaged or the crew returned home. While onboard the ship, Kelvin flashes back a few years prior to memories of his ex-wife who committed suicide after they had a fight about her having an abortion without telling him. Angry about her having the abortion without telling him, Kelvin tells her he is leaving her, she replies \\"I won't make it without you\\" to which he responds coldly \\"then you won't make it.\\" She commits suicide. Kelvin returns some hours later to their apartment to find that she has taken her own life.<br /><br />Kelvin is haunted by this guilt and has never really gotten over the suicide of his wife.<br /><br />Onboard the space ship Kelvin dreams about his ex-wife and to his surprise she has appeared on the ship. At least someone that looks exactly like her. What has actually happened is that by dreaming about her, Kelvin has manifested a clone of her onto the ship, but the clone has no real emotional connection to the memories that Kelvin has of his ex-wife. The clone keeps attempting suicide because that is how Kelvin remembers her, as suicidal. But since she really isn't alive in the first place, she can't die.<br /><br />The remaining crew discuss whether to return to Earth or not. At first it appears that Kelvin has been transported back to Earth and resumes his life in his New York apartment but later we learn Kelvin actually chooses to stay on the ship and dream of himself as being back in the New York apartment with his ex-wife. He in essence chooses a fantasy life over a reality life, though this is a concept that the film maker would like you to think about. What is fantasy and what is reality and isn't our perception really more important than \\"reality\\" anyway.<br /><br />I liked the film. I've watched it twice now. Vanilla Sky (2001) covers similar ground but that movie was  visually and auditorally stunning whereas Solaris has more of a literary feel to it. Like someone is reading the story to you, and you are looking at some illustrations on a page. That probably appeals to some, and doesn't appeal to others. I feel, however, that the film is responsible for not only putting forth the premise of fantasy v. reality, but also to move that discussion forward with some original insight. But this film doesn't deliver on that. And that to me is where the film falls short.<br /><br />FINAL GRADE: Br would like you to think about.

B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|Even in an age when the studios placed restrictions on what would appear on screen director John Huston was a highly individual and uncomprosing auteur.  Despite the film's ostensible setting in the gaiety of Paris' Moulin Rouge the film is front-and-center a portrait of a brooding cognac besotted artist Henri de Latrouse-Lautrec(Jose Ferrer).  Born of French nobility, Latrouse-Lautrec was left crippled and deformed at an early age by a freak household accident.  Embittered, Latrouse-Lautrec felt incapable or unworthy of being loved by a woman.  Instead, he channels his passion into his painting with the Paris streets and primarily the notorious Moulin Rouge being his main subject matters.  And what a thing of beauty his visions are!  Despite salving his pain in alcohol Latrouse-Lautrec was still able to channel his passion into his indelible works of art.  Including \\"Lust for Life\\", \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is probably the best biography of a painter I've ever seen on screen.  Jose Ferrer, a lead actor who had the misfortune of being typecast in supporting roles for most of his career, is nothing less than wondrous as Latrouse-Lautrec.  He embodies all the conflicts and contradictions of the man with few histrionics.  \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is a work for the ages.
0812974611|4.0|I had to read this for my class and I ended up liking it. The book is historically accurate for the most part and the story is engaging for the reader. The main character is very human and easy to identify with. He has a background that isn't over done.<br /><br />The story really picks up in the last hundred pages!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|You don't have to be a Beatles fan to love this movie - it is so original in concept. The music enhances the story and vividly portrays life in the 60's and all the turmoil surrounding the times, drugs, integration and the Vietnam war. The special effects are amazing - psychedlic - and really startling. I loved this film and recommend it highly.
B0010X745K|4.0|This is a movie that is both cool and unsettling all at the same time.Although after a freak storm this mist appears across the lake.Why? Nobody knows and you think Steven King will tell you.Wrong again! If you've seen Shawshank Redemption or the Green Mile,Frank Darabont doesn't use excessive blood flow but relies heavily on the suspense.Its called Macabe people.Anyway Thomas Jane was ok but a little soft spoken which gave him an eerie persona to begin with.It seems the normal down to earth people get oft quickly.I was beginning to wonder if it was safer in the store or trying to get to their vechicles.I was going to rent this but they were out.....So I bought it...good investment.
0452289963|5.0|I have read many books in the past about positive thinking and such, but this book actually explains it in a way you can understand.  After every page, you are like, \\"I got it now.\\"  I would recommend it to anyone.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I guarentee you've never seen a movie quite like this.  Bounderies are definately pushed in this movie about people in New York City dealing with finding themselves in a post-9/11 America.<br /><br />If you like sex unfiltered in your movies that further a story as opposed to detract from it, then this is the movie for you.  You must be extremely open minded.  The sex performed is real and the acting is intense.  The emotions that the characters have to deal with are universal and everyone can connect with someone in this movie.<br /><br />Very enjoyable!  :-D
B0013FBS20|3.0|If you have seen the two previous film incarnations of this story then you cannot help but notice the glaring inadequacies.  This film chose to ignore nuances of the story line that would have allowed viewers to connect with these characters on a more personal level.  While the latest graphic technologies allowed for scarier representations of the mutants, it does not make up for the missing depth that would have been provided by increased character development of the mutants, and the surviving scientist.  My personal favorite film version of this story is \\"Omega Man\\" with Charlton Heston released in 1971.  There is also \\"The Last Man On Earth\\"  with Vincent Price released in 1964.  It is interesting how each of these films took different in avenues in interpreting Richard Mathesons' novel.  Check them out!
B0007Y08QA|1.0|The cinematography was great but unfortunately that alone a worthy movie does not make. I was hoping perhaps the ending might make up for the terrible film but I was badly dissatisfied. I understand some people may view this film as some sort of high art but as for I it did not connect.
0563214546|5.0|This book has been with me since my teens. I learned to cook with Delia and love the detail she gives so you're not left hanging wondering what a certain term means or what size cake tin to use. I have her to thank for my reputation as a good cook. She has changed the world's impression of English cooking to one where we rank with the best.  If you only buy one book for your new wife, cook, would be entertainer or family culinary provider this is it! Enjoy!
B00008GKEG|5.0|This series was done under the supervision of the surviving Beatles at the time (mid 90's) and is basically the story of The Beatles from their perspective.  There are lots of interviews with Paul, George, and Ringo with footage from interviews with John.  There is a lot of insight into why things happened the way they did.  (i.e. their decision to stop touring, Brian Epstein's death, etc.) It starts from their Liverpool roots and follows their fame to Abbey Road.  There is lots of excellent footage and I was particularly pleased that they included the \\"videos\\" that the band created some twenty years ahead of MTV.  Because of the involvment of the surviving Beatles in the production, some of the conflict that happened within the band isn't mentioned or is mentioned briefly.  The strongest things about this series are the interviews and the music.  I highly recommend it, especially if you're a Beatles fan.
B00005R5G9|5.0|This product arrived fast and in great condition.  I love this movie!  I have not seen it since I was a child so it was a trip down memory lane.
B000XRG9IW|5.0|I heard this yesterday at the local record store and immediately grabbed it. This is one of those rare gems you infrequently get turned on to. Just one more reason to lament the demise of CD stores in favor of online downloading, eh? For everyone over 50, picture this: What if Grace Slick had been the lead singer of 70s era King Crimson? Great stuff!! A truly unique mixture of influences. Like the retro synth, B3 and acoustic sounds!!
B00005JPMZ|2.0|I just borrowed this from the library for free and it has absolutely nothing to do with the original theatrical movies which where live action movies and this one looks fake because it actually looks like a computer video game with animation added, nothing original about it and the story is not complete so I can't believe that people wasted tier money at the movie houses to see it, the extras only tell a little about the actual creation of hos the turtles came to be.
B000E6UWE4|4.0|I found the book to be very slow going the first couple chapters, and constantly found myself looking up places and names in the index to try and figure out what was happening, but if you keep with it and stick it through it is an entirely worthwile book.     Pros:      Unique writing style     Descriptions are vastly detailed     Even though based in another world with magic it feels realistic     Doesn't spoon feed you every little scrap of information and leaves your imagination to do some work  Cons:      The final battle with the Jaghunt is built up and dissapointing      You do get confused about names and places     The map at the beginning of the book can be more confusing than the book       Overal: I enjoyed reading the book, but it can be a little confusing at times. Make sure if you buy it to get past the first couple chapters and dont get too frustrated if you dont know every name or race. Do not buy if you like to be spoon fed every little detail in the book. It is not Tolkein nor does it strive to be.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|I love Clutch's \\"Clutch\\" CD, and I was looking for another one to add to my collection. I bought \\"Robot Hive\\" based solely on the glowing reviews posted here. Amazing music as advertised. It's a must own for anyone into heavy rock with a sense of humor and brains to burn.
0452289963|5.0|I just finished this book last night and loved it.  I have been following along with Oprah and Eckart in the weekly programs and it has been very helpful to hear a discussion about this deeply moving book.  I think I was ready for this discussion and agree with the content.  It is a book that will make a difference in the shape of the world to come.
B000056N8X|5.0|This DVD epitomizes the best of the best from the Highlander series.  There were a few cheesy moments and a touch of overacting here and there, but over all it was a solid hit.  If the story were to stop here this would be a good way to wrap it all up.
B00122OCGI|5.0|I bought this album way before the price jumped to $200. Because I've been a long time fan of British Heavy Metal, and most importantly, Diamond Head. You just can't beat the Tatler/Harris songwriting team. This is their 'unofficial/offical' debut album. I guess their 1979 Four Cuts EP doesn't count?...Anyway, every song on this is a Diamond Head classic. From the title track, with it's big opening, to Helpless. The near nine-minute sexual epic Sucking My Love also is a classic. Diamond Head somehow got lost in the NWOBHM movement of the late 70's-early 80's. Theirs is ultimately a tragic story, however, as after this album they would only release two more with the classic lineup. 1982's Borrowed Time, and 1983's Canterbury, each one noticeably weaker than it's predecessor. In many an opinion, Diamond Head were the natural musical successors to Led Zeppelin. They influenced many Hard Rock/Metal bands, Metallica just to name one. If you really like early British Metal, then this album is for you.

B000H2EJSK|4.0|By Yenna Buchay<br />I've eaten frogs and tadpoles (raw) all week. Tadpoles slide down easier. But a tadpole-full stomach can't accommodate frogs!<br />My tadpoles require little thought; sweep floors, do laundry, read the newspaper-- all these my brain performs on automatic.<br /> But I avoid several important frogs: Where did the frog/tadpole metaphor come from? Tracy's book!<br />This delightful (except for one point) book labels as frogs important jobs we avoid. I slogged from my pond of indifference when Tracy said we'll never catch up on everything we have to do.<br />We ned to complete important tasks (the frogs) first. Tracy advises Eat those ugly frogs, then swallow tadpoles.<br />He assigns frog status by an ABCDE plan. The A jobs produce the most, are urgent--and we dread them. Poor planning results in procrastination. B jobs, less urgent, tackle after completing A's. C jobs (tadpoles) save for free time. D jobs, delegate and E jobs, eliminate.<br />We relish tadpoles because finished work creates self-worth, raises feel-good hormones, fills us with an empowering sense of success.<br />I love the frog idea and have produced far more since reading this book. My `A level frog still hops off, but I'll soon organize a snare-that-frog-hunt.<br />Other Tracy's ideas will increase my output, except for one: \\"Develop a sense of urgency about A tasks.\\" I was exhausted for two hours by that chapter. I've never been a high-energy person, but my snail-paced life slides me forward.<br />I'll maybe exchange my snail for a sedate toad, but not a racing-manic frog
B000002UUX|4.0|After buying the whole Megadeth collection in the last few weeks I thought I would write my first review.  After listening to music for the last 30 years, I'm 38 now, I got into Thrash metal about a year ago after getting into all the early Metallica albums which I love. I had to try the next biggest metal selling band.  I made the mistake of buying Rust in Peace - Remastered which didn't really grab me. Luckily I gave Peace Sells a try and loved it.   After buying all Megadeth albums I realized how great they were. I know a lot of fans prefer their 80s work the best, but I don't think they have made one bad album. By bad I mean Metallica \\"St Anger\\" bad which I can't even listen to.   I finally got a copy of the original Rust in Peace and it blew me away. The 1st 2 songs are incredible. The pace and musicianship are mindblowing. From the 3rd song down the pace slows but the songs are still catchy. I wouldn't say it's my favourite Deth album as I like them all but do yourself a favour if you like this type of music, just buy it.  It is one of the best Heavy metal albums of all time.  I hope my review helped.
B0012K1ILW|4.0|Some of the songs have a nice smooth 70's feel.  A nice retro vibe.  Very \\"Erykah\\".

B0010X745K|4.0|This is another great Stephen King story.  You cannot be a King fan and not like this movie.  It isn't as good as The Green Mile, but it does create an atmosphere similar to Dreamcatcher.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I even enjoyed all the special features.<br /><br />I read the novella years ago and was not disappointed in the movie.
B000YEK6AG|5.0|The Dr. Ebbett's Centered Stereo Remixes of this album (The Vocals) just blows any other remaster/remix out of the water! It's just as simple as that.I would give this a 10 out of 10\\" rating.It is so enjoyable to listen to Ebbett has really done a great job here. Very natural sounding. In fact, it sounds like it was recorded yesterday, not 40 years ago.<br />These recordings are spectacular in stereo, here is the proof.
B0012QE4OO|5.0|I found this movie so entertaining, I was not disappointed.  The concept is good, even though it was treated very juvenile.  One thing I liked is that violence was very low, allowing the movie to be seen by a general public.  I've seen some comments about the acting, but I found very interesting the way Hayden Christensen performed his roll.  There was some kind of a mysterious look on his face with little expression, revealing that there is some kind of uncomforting secret he is hiding and a power like that; you just can't tell anyone.  He looks like he wishes to be honest with everyone but then he knows it is dangerous, so he needs to hide it from the people he cares about; it's not easy.  His roll was managed in a very mysterious way, which in my opinion gave a very special touch to the movie.  There's a lot of action, fights, car race, jumping, etc... even romance, what else do you want from a science fiction movie? 6 stars in total.
B000022TSW|5.0|The South Park movie was done at the alleged height of South Park's popularity.  It was done during South Park's early seasons when it had become a big merchandising machine where people everywhere were proclaiming \\"OMG, you killed Kenny!\\"  For this reason, \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut\\" seemed destined to merely be a longer version of the show and mild diversion from getting your 30 minute weekly fix.<br /><br />This was not to be.  While the animation was basically the same as the cheaply made tv show (with a few minor exceptions, such as the animation of Hell), the film set the bar higher for humor, plot, and overall relevance.  This film wears its message on its sleeve and probably set the standard for how South Park would venture further into satire and social relevance into the present day.  Yes, it's full of curse words they can't say on TV and it's not for kids and that's exactly what they tell you when you watch the movie.  This film does some very sly finger pointing, and no, the devil is not to blame.<br /><br />But satire aside, this film is very funny poking fun at everything from celebrity, saddam, and Broadway of all things.  The Academy Award-nominated music is both funny and fantastic.  It's the anti-Disney movie. The irony, the music may actually be better than the Disney lot these days.  It's the music's quality, in fact, that helps the quality of this film rise above merely giving a TV show a full length motion picture makeover.  The songs are funny and catchy.  Watch it enough, you'll start singing along.<br /><br />But there's a telling scene in the film that had me sold from the first time I watched the movie.  Early on, the boys' parents are assembling the people of South Park and speaking about the filth their kids are watching.  The kids try to talk to their parents while being all but ignored by them.  It's a cleverly done scene that speaks volumes, driving its message home.<br /><br />South Park has become something of a culturalinstitution.  While this was done in South Park's heyday, it's continued to rise again and again in the spotlight as it continualy prys and pokes at society with subversive humor.  At nearly 10 years in age, the movie's themes are still timeless and the humor still seems edgy.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll think - It's provocative and funny.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Tim Burton's cinematic version of Sondheim's macabre tale is magnificent, wondrous, brilliant and all them other words. Sondheim has suffered gravely toiling in Hollywood's fields; A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum bore slight resemblance to the original stage work, and the less said about the film of A Little Night Music, the better. In Sweeney, we have a film in total service to the music and lyrics, yet very different from the live show. The sexual relationships are bit easier to understand due to the greatly reduced ages of the performers. More than that, Sweeney Todd is a movie that has in its background a stage show. It can be called artificial in the sense that to a greater or lesser extent, all of Burton's films are laid in an incredibly tightly controlled world ruled by the director and his designers. Artificial, maybe, but never stagy. The piece has been totally reimagined for the movie, songs cut and re-arranged, shortened, lengthened and rethought to work in a completely cinematic way. With homage to the Hammer horror films, Burton moves swiftly and smoothly through a Victorian London created only for this world of Sweeney. The cast is fine, with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter acting and singing the murderous couple with calm and calculating competence. Alan Rickman could perhaps be a little more seedy and pervy as the Judge, and a non-Borat Sacha Baron Cohen is properly slimy as Pirelli, Sweeney's first victim. This movie is the first really good movie musical in years. Buy the DVD, you will enjoy the genius of the performers, the director, and, most importantly, finally, a fine movie by the musical genius of the twentieth century.
0452289963|5.0|I would highly recommend Eckhart Tolle's book \\"A New Earth\\", for any one who thinks of themselves as a 'seeker'. It is thought provoking, awakening one to feelings they might not know are in them. Reading this book, along with taking Oprah's online class is an adventure not to be missed. It is not a 'religious' book per say, but a book that takes you along paths you might not otherwise walk. It puts you in touch with the earth around you, things you see every day but don't really 'see'. Like being a child and watching an ant crawling along a blade of grass. It makes you look at the world like you might have as a child and have forgotten as an adult.
1400034205|5.0|The book and audio detail exquisite conversations and journeys apropos of what many are currently going through now. Lovely vignettes and snapshots of a bygone era-however it seems the issues of enlightment and self examination are universal. Wonderfully written and always refreshing to reread. I love Maughn-he captures so much in each scene.
0385522401|2.0|This is a very short, very pointless novella in my opinion.  It is in no way comparable to Atonement.  The prose is in McEwan's usual excellent style, but I was left with the feeling, \\"Is that all?\\"
0525950079|1.0|Perhaps the failing of WWE is due to the promise of being the sequel of Pillars of the Earth.      Whatever the reason, the book fails for many reasons.  It is much too long, does not flow and is certainly predictable.  And as other reviewers have noted, Follett's anti-Christian or at least anit-Catholic bias leaps from the pages so blatantly one almost has to laugh.  And if this work were the only one you read on the time period you would assume that almost all in the church are gay.    Read Pillars of the Earth, skip WWE and move on to some of his better works.
B00000IYWH|5.0|I received this CD for Xmas after researching and boy did it live up to the reviews!  Elvis's voice is magnificant; it had matured while in the Army for two years and is pure joy to hear.  It is a little depressing to hear what he was capable of at that time, but was mis-managed into the dreadful movies. Even my 14 years old son loves this CD.  It is just about all we have listened to in the car since Xmas.  Everyone has their favorite time of Elvis, but it would be hard to argue that this was Elvis's voice at its best.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|Glad I bought it and my kid and I will certainly watch this again and again but...I have to agree with the issues previously stated. Still, great production values and an entertaining video. I do think they did a credible job of killing off this story line which was a poor substitute for those nasty Goauld. Looking forward to the next one, with Baal and the bad guy (I think) and I hope they make enough cash on these to keep them coming.(If the cast are still into it)
0553582445|4.0|The first 200 pages are filled with flashbacks/recollections of what happened in the Assassin's Quest series to get the reader up to speed, with little plot.  I just read the Assassin's Quest series, so I skimmed through that fairly quickly.  After that the story picked up pace and was a fairly good ride through to the end.  There's something that happens on a beach, that I felt stuck out rather strongly and took me out of the story.  Hobb is usually quite deft in her planting of seeds and it was rather sad to read this obvious plant that will undoubtedly pop up in the rest of the series.  I'm not a fan of characters doing things that are obviously stupid to the average person.  So, I was quite surprised about that.  Other than that, it was a fairly fun book to read and continue Fitz's life.
B000Y7U98W|2.0|Although it had been recommended by a very sophisticated friend, I found Sunshine to be derivative and annoying.  It drives me up the wall when characters make decisions that seem implausible, out of character, or just plain stupid.  The plot of Sunshine is driven by such decisions.  Add to that unnecessarily gruesome scenes, weak physics, and a predictable plot and you get a teeth-gritting experience.    That said, the visuals are stunning, and as much as I was irritated, at the end my heart was pounding.  If you are looking for a sci-fi thriller and can maintain suspension of disbelief for a couple of hours, you might love it.
B0002EQ7EC|4.0|I have always liked this album and so there is no surprise on why i rate it so much .. but why just a 4 and not a 5? the music is great but i am not happy about the quality of the CD i received .. the sound quality is ok, but the CD looks like a cheap quality and not like an original one .. the edge has some black shades or marks and it does look like a cheap imitation .. i wish that that i had purchased from music shop.. but i may not have got this price .. anyway, i should have checked first ..

B000FFJYCU|5.0|great to finally see this film on DVD.  typical 60's style cinema. it does do a good job of documenting this great era of auto racing, and is a must for any F-1 fan. the extras are nice, too.

B000Z6MIQS|5.0|I am not really sure what the problem is with the music being different.  I guess you can't please everyone because if they keep playing the same songs then people won't like them because they keep playing the same music and not differentiating themselves.  Anyway I think it is a great step for them, they took a big risk but I feel it paid off.  Their songs are unique, great lyrics, and just sound really good.  I definitely think this is worth a purchase.

B00005JPTI|5.0|Well, most zombie/mutant movies are repetitive (therefore boring over time) but I Am Legend is different. It's very interesting, will keep you in your seat the whole time, and it has a really good regular dog- against- zombie dog fight.       Special Features suck, though: Most people probably wouldn't care, but I myself am big on commentaries and enjoy watching them, (and to my dismay) this doesn't have one, NOT ONE, no director commentaries, no cast commentaries (one with Will Smith \\"Dr. Neville\\" himself would've been AWESOME), and not even one with a damn photographer, NONE!      Also for Special features: No matter what edition you BUY, all include 4 boring, 3 minute animated shorts that have NOTHING AT ALL to do with the movie (I honestly don't know why they're there). If you BUY the 2-disc special edition with digital copy (what i own) you get a DVD specifically designed for a Windows XP or higher to import the Movie into your computer so you can get a digital copy of sorts, and it also includes a 2nd disc with the alternate \\"controversial\\" ending. I don't know what's so \\"controversial\\" about it and also, I don't think it's all that great (I prefer the the featured one over the alternate).    OVERALL:: BUY THIS TODAY, IT'S WORTH THE MONEY!    Also, just because it's pg-13 doesnt mean it's not scary as hell, it's not as gory as say resident Evil or Dawn of the Dead, but it will jump you numerous times because there is no music to build up suspense. things just jump out.    GOOD MOVIE!
0743298020|5.0|Every so often, a book will touch you so that you know it will become one of your cherished favorites, something that, in the event of a fire, you would save. I loved The Thirteenth Tale - every bit of it - and didn't want to put it down. I was sad when I reached the end but only because I was so into this story, I didn't want to separate myself. I look forward to more intriguing writing from this exciting author. As the author of a first novel myself, I am in awe of Diane Setterfield's writing.
B0000X61VE|5.0|The product that I bought was properly packaged, in good working order, and was recieved in a timely manner.  I would recommend the seller and would buy from them in the future if the oppurtunity arises.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I want to add my applause for Once. It combines an enjoyable movie with stimulating music. The story revolves around likable, believable characters struggling through lives teetering on brokenness.  They suffer from the pain of hurtful, neglectful loved ones yet they are pressing on and fighting on and finding strength and expression in their music that nobody has seemed to hear until they meet one another.. In the midst of their friendship, they create passionate, moving music and find inspiration for reconciliation and purpose.<br /><br />I think you will want to watch this one more than once.
B0009VRHLK|2.0|by Dane Youssef<br /><br />\\"THE BROWN BUNNY\\" plays out like an Andy Warhol-inspired exercise that was warped into a vanity project. It's like a home movie on a family road trip where nothing is really going on and whoever has the camera is just killing time out of boredom<br /><br />Some moments are quietly effective and inspire little musings in our heads. But far too much feels like something little that a brown bunny left behind... that's also brown.<br /><br />Either the bunny or Gallo. He serves as writer, director, producer, composer and cinematographer. I think there's more, but I just don't have time.<br /><br />The film stars Gallo as Bud Clay, a professional motorcycle racer going on one big long odyssey on the road to his old haunts to rediscover himself.<br /><br />He will uncover a lot of things along the way, particularly that he is trapped inside a movie that just plain isn't very good.<br /><br />Vincent Gallo's \\"The Brown Bunny\\" is a self-indulgent exercise in futility. Although Gallo may consider this a compliment, I mean the making of the film itself, not this hero's story. So masturbatory, I actually wished I was blind before I was even 1/4 of the way through.<br /><br />But it could have been. If Gallo had cut more of the scenes (and I don't just mean a few), put some music down on the soundtrack, shown more of the beautiful outdoor landscapes... and less of the interior of the car, Gallo himself just sitting there, preening. Striking a model-like pose in long, long, unbroken shots that feel endless.<br /><br />Like they're a half-hour long. Gallo is a strikingly good-looking European man, but not nearly so that we can watch him for that long without getting itchy and restless.<br /><br />You kind of wish the filmmaker (and there's only one--Gallo himself) had conjured up more music and put it on the soundtrack. Some more music might have helped pump up a lot stillborn scenes.<br /><br />My description of the the first 3/4's of the film torturous boredom doesn't even begin to do it justice. Gallo keeps the entire \\"Brown Bunny\\" moving at the pace of moss growing on a tree or rock.<br /><br />There's a lot of flat, still dialouge with a lot of dramatic pauses (in a pathetic attempt to pump it up), the acting isn't much (except for Gallo and Sevigny) and the long, unbroken static shots with Gallo is staring off into the distance (which there are more than TOO MUCH of) inspired me to itch so much, I thought I came down with a horrible rash.<br /><br />Hell, at one point, I actually wanted to throw things right at the screen. No lie, it actually came to mind--I would rather see some of the lowest points of \\"Howard The Duck\\" than look at Gallo's god dammed face for three more seconds.<br /><br />Yes, that's how bad it got.<br /><br />I know that the cut of the movie that was screened at Cannes (the film was not finished yet, but Gallo was pushed into releasing it) was indefinitely worse. But although I think that much of the editing was for the better (from what I've heard, it was vital), Gallo still needed to cut a few more scenes out of the movie and lay some more music here and there.<br /><br />Despite talent on Gallo's part and some ambition to tell a worthwhile story, \\"Brown Bunny\\" moves at the pace of moss growing, no one throughout the film as a character is particularly intriguing or well-developed, not even Gallo's own character (the exception is Chloe Sevigny) and there are too many slow spot where we're just waiting for something, anything to happen.<br /><br />We don't have any idea exactly what Bud is thinking most of the time (or God help us, Gallo even). Maybe we're supposed to figure it out for ourselves. Perhaps Gallo wants our minds to speculate and wander. Is he leaving the thoughts of this odyssey up to our imagination? Or did he just not think this one through.<br /><br />I was often bored and shifting back-and-forth in my seat, all throughout (except for the ending). I thought the movie needed more scenes of dialouge, more moments where Bud and those he encounters on his journey interact.<br /><br />Also, much of the dialouge throughout every scene throughout the film was written is so badly recorded, I couldn't understand a word they were saying. I had to turn on the SUBTITLES just to understand what the hell they were saying.<br /><br />I'm capable of appreciating a deep, slow-paced movie. But this one isn't just slow, it's d.o.a.<br /><br />Many European filmmakers know how to make a slow movie work like a chess match or a staring contest, so that even when nothing is happening, it FEELS like Hell itself is breaking loose. Gallo obviously hasn't mastered that himself. He should have seen more of their work and studied it before putting \\"The Brown Bunny\\" into effect.<br /><br />The late, great Stanley Kubrick himself defined and cornered the market on quietly brooding, suspenseful films. I would suggest Gallo pop in some of HIS movies in if he ever wants to make another movie in this vein.<br /><br />But Gallo himself has admitted he is no filmmaker--or artist. In any sense of the word. He is a hustler. A Midnight Cowboy of sorts. He has acted, modeled, directed, wrote, painted... have I painted enough of a picture myself?<br /><br />He is a man of innumerable talents. But he has no major. He hawks his skills to whatever at any given moment. He may not be a household name, but those that do know his name... look at him as something a little more than mortal.<br /><br />Ted Curson, Jackson C. Frank, Vincent Gallo are credited for the musical score. At least Gallo admitted he needed some outside help there.<br /><br />Reformed supermodel Cheryl Diggs doesn't really provide anything else but filler to kill the static. Hey, maybe she serves a vital purpose after all.<br /><br />Chloe Sevigny (\\"Kids\\" and \\"Trees Lounge\\") is such a good actress and has such a touching character, it's a damn crime against cinema she doesn't have more scenes. She should have been such a more sustantial part of the film. She is a part of the fourth act where the comatose \\"Brown Bunny\\" almost bursts to life.<br /><br />At the end of it all, there is the smallest ray of hope. Not just for Gallo's character, but for Gallo. And us. And his film. And what of that brown bunny that sits in the cage? That holds the film's prominent title? What of it? What's it's story?<br /><br />I would have loved to see this world through it's eyes. What would it have to say? Do you wonder... ?<br /><br />--For That Poor Damn Bunny, Dane Youssef<br /><br />danessf@yahoo.comteract.

0689865384|4.0|This book was such a great read! I'm a sophomore in high school and it was really easy for me to connect with a lot of the themes that came up in this novel.  The story and plot was very suspenseful and it kept my attention and made me never want to put it down.  However, in my opinion the book had a little too much science fiction in it than was necessary but it was still a captivating story.  I think the author did a really good job of conveying the thoughts of a teenage girl who just wanted to be pretty.  I know that a lot of girls can probably relate and that's why I really liked this book.  It really makes you think about our society today and how fixed we are on this idea of beauty and vanity.  I give this book 4 stars for being a well written novel that was also fun and interesting to read.
6304779356|3.0|I Love this Movie, But! This Movie was not in tip top shape. The cover was poorly taken care of. Looks like it was torn and had tape on it. I wanted it for my collection. It's appearance was not collection material. So i gave it to my kids. I guess you get what you pay for. All in all the movie was in good condition. I just wished it was all in good condition.
0307387178|4.0|In reading this fascinating and intriguing book, I found myself admiring this foolhardy young man, hoping he would succeed in finding whatever he was looking for, and, in the end, survive and tell us his own story What a book that would be...what a story that would be..    As anyone reading this review probably knows, this is the story of a young man rebelling you might say against his parents, society and the world around him. Seeking to find himself, seeking to show that it can be done and, perhaps, running from whatever demons haunted his soul, the young man goes to Alaska, seeks to cut off all ties with the world as he has known it, and live in the Wild, off the land. (Jeremiah Johnson, as portrayed by Robert Redford could have been his hero and example.)     Expertly researched and superb in detail, this book is the story of not only a lonely, perhaps mixed up young man, but of the land and those he encountered. Say what you will for Chris--or Alex--the young man had the ability to affect people, mainly for the good.     No matter what his problems may have been, his story, had he survived, might well have been a Putlizer Prize winner--especially if Krakauer had written. He's good. Very good.
1932907009|5.0|Great book that really gives you the nuts and bolts of the Hollywood method of giving them what they want.  Completely spells out the the whole script for you, what should happen on what page etc.  If your only goal is to sell a script to Hollywood then this is probably the last book on screenwriting you will ever need.<br /><br />  The author subscribes to the notion that all Hollywood wants is the same exact thing only diiferent.  Which is true, sad but true.<br /><br />I learned a lot about the basic structure of telling a story and about character growth and lots more.<br /><br />Even if you want to be a rebel and make the movie Hollywood never had the balls to make, read this book!  It will help you write a better script!

B0010X745K|3.0|I have not read the King novella in many, many years and planned to do so before seeing the movie.  However, after reading so much controversy over the ending, I decided to see it without first refreshing myself by reading the story.  I had remembered only the main gist of the story so I felt going into the movie I had fairly few preconceptions.  I wanted to do this so I didn't bias my opinion of the movie towards the original story.    The bulk of the movie is very good, it's suspenseful, and it follows King's story as much as I remember it; no complaints.  In fact, I thought it was great!    Then comes the ending.  All the controversy is around what the main character, David Drayton, \\"does\\".  I agree with those that say that what he does is not in line with his character.  It just simply isn't, and therefore from that point on the movie slides downhill rapidly.  I won't say that what he does is either good or bad, because frankly it's subjective.  I simply think it was not a plausible act by that character.  But I don't really have too much of a problem with it.  The problem I have is that this is NOT the very ending of the movie.  It continues.  And it's what happens after this that really turns a would-be great movie into just a \\"good\\" movie.    King left the story open at the end leaving us with a thought inspiring idea.  That is, if you open Pandora's box, you are going to have to live with the consequences.  The movie, on the other hand, cops out and in typical Hollywood fashion presumes that if you open the box you don't have to worry because human kind always wins and there is always a happy ending.      I will never understand two things about Hollywood:  First, why do they always have to mess with a good thing?  This was one of King's best stories, why change it?  And second, why does Hollywood always have to have the \\"everything is going to be alright\\" ending?  This is a perfect example of when the \\"happy ending\\" just doesn't make sense considering the magnitude of how badly the humans messed up.  I guess it boils down to the fact that there are two kinds of people in the world: \\"those who need closure and.\\"  Hollywood is the first kind of people, King is the second.    So, in summary I think it was primarily a good movie.  I don't think what David Drayton does at the end makes sense but I also don't really care.  I do think that the VERY end is neither good nor bad...but simply WRONG and it's because of that that my review loses a couple of stars.    BTW...if you want the \\"real\\" Stephen King vision of the story, I recommend that you watch right up to point where Drayton's SUV runs out of gas then SHUT IT OFF and do not watch any more.  If I had done that, I would have given the movie five stars!!!
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|I needed an extra throttle to go with my Saitek Yoke and Throttle. I purchased my second one from Amazon. They told everything needed to know to purchase the product. It was shipped quickly, and works without any flaws. Would recommend anyone buying from Amazon, and I would recommend buying this product, and would buy it or anything from Amazon. GREAT PRODUCT.

0452289963|5.0|This book is very interesting and makes you think about your \\"inner state of being\\", and how we are all connected human beings.  I find it fasinating and thought-provoking. It stays on my bedside table, so I can refer back to it, time and again. No wonder Oprah and people across the world are reading this book.  If all of us can understand and practice these concepts, then we would all be better off! Maybe it could even lead to \\"World Peace\\"!!
0307386864|5.0|This book is truly a love story classic. I enjoy all of Jane Austen's work, but this one has always been my favorite. It is beautifully written and has a wonderful ensemble of characters that give real life to the story. Their loss is your loss, and their joy is your joy.<br /><br />A must to read and cherish forever.
B0000640VN|5.0|I'm into romantic comedies BIG TIME, and so far my favorite is Just like Heaven. This movie though, is a VERY close second!! It's dreamy! It's magical! And it's romantic! I'd say this movie is the closest to Cinderella any movie can get. There seemed not much wrong with the acting of Meg Ryan (I read reviews where people complained about it). She definitely looked good. She looked beautiful. And the romance portrayed between her and Jackman was better than I remember seeing in any romantic comedy recently. Veryyy highly recommended. One of the best love stories you'll ever come across.<br /><br />As I expect of any 'love story' with a happy ending, this one made me laugh, cry, dream...and completely convinced me all over again that true love really is true. :)
B000001FFJ|5.0|I consider \\"Rain Dogs\\", \\"Swordfishtrombones\\", and \\"Heartattack and Vine\\" the three core albums that any Tom Waits fan must have.  While his earlier albums have an an aesthetic that some fans enjoy--I don't as much--these three show him finding his new footing as an artist.  They are the three that I simply could not do without.  The subsequent albums are treasures as well, but are, to a certain degree, fine tuning of his style, with a few variations.  \\"Rain Dogs\\" contains a perfect balance of sentimentality and noir callousness in brilliant poetry that any artist can achieve once in a lifetime if they're lucky.

B000YCLRBA|4.0|REVIEW OF PUSHKIN'S ONEGIN    The very talented cast is up to performing with passion Pushkin's Onegin, however Elena Zaremba would have been much better suited playing Tatiania's Mother and the more youthful looking Mother, Olga.     I do feel that Carsen's staging is a big disappointment to both the cast and certainly to the audience as well.  It was a great distraction from the performances. One has to ask if Michael Levine has a prejudice against presenting Russian culture in his stage scenes.  Two steel pipes and a stage strewn with leaves, does not make a birch forest in a Russian countryside.  And what would it have cost production to have two pillars in the backdrop and a chandelier hanging from the center stage to convey a ballroom scene in St. Petersburg?  The stark eclectic staging of Onegin is something only a Stalinist could appreciate.    I had considered seeing Onegin when it came to Chicago in March but after noting it was a Carsen-Levine staging I opted to buy the DVD and am so very glad I did so.  I saved over $280.  The performances are great despite the drab setting they were compelled to perform in.  Supreme talent outshines a mediocre production.     J. Ray
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I've attended the live show, and I'd had to try the DVD to check out the sound quality. What a wonderful surprise, it's great. I felt almost like in the Mirage's LOVE Theater.

The production: Sir George Martin - what a wonderful job!!! Congratulations.
B000003TA4|1.0|I can't say i've ever heard of this band, they must be really unpopular.  What the heck is this, is the guy chewing on a peanut butter smothered bologna sandwich during those verses?  At least i can understand that hippie song cover, but, good cinco de mayo what has he done to it?  Apparently the man called butch vig was smoking left over feta cheese or something, it sounds like a window pane being cleaned.  And how about that smells like beer nuts song or whatever it is, that can't be easily marketed, must have been a doosy of a release party.  I think there's like two notes in the whole song.  I suppose that's all kids need these days to bob their heads to, one for up, two for down.  Up, down, up, down, hellow, hellow, (inaudible sandwich chewing), i'm mufasa, it's less flavorous, we're nirvana, end the hat dance, and then he says something about \\"i'm done flossing\\".  If that guy has dentures, i guess that would make a lot of sense, a lot more then \\"as an old phlegmery\\".
B000UBMSB8|5.0|After buying three different 'definitive' versions of \\"Blade Runner\\", I was gun-shy about purchasing yet another...but this is an excellent investment, as you'll never find a more comprehensive look at the creation of a groundbreaking SF classic, with insights from virtually all of the major creative people involved.<br /><br />Be warned; if you aren't already a \\"Blade Runner\\" fan, this new collection will probably not change your opinion of the film. The \\"Blade Runner\\" vision of the future is not happy, or upbeat, but of a dying world choking in it's own overpopulation and pollution, where a multitude of cultures compete for space, and life is grim, at best. The sheer power of the visual elements, alone (done, amazingly, without CGI) would forever change how filmmakers would visualize cities...but Scott's relentlessly grim vision, and the noir drama of tenacious lawman Harrison Ford hunting down four androids desperately trying to survive, is not one that appeals to everyone!<br /><br />Wisely, this collection offers four versions of the film; the voice-over narration 'happy ending' 1982 theatrical release, the longer, more graphic 1982 'international' release, Ridley Scott's initial 'Director's Cut' (eliminating the 'voice-overs', and adding the famous 'unicorn' sequence), and a new, 'final' edition, cleaning up and tweaking several scenes that time and money constraints prevented, at the time of release. Each version has it's own admirers, and even Scott himself acknowledges all have merit.<br /><br />The real 'bonus' of this collection is, certainly, the feature-length documentary, \\"DANGEROUS DAYS: MAKING BLADE RUNNER\\", one of the most comprehensive histories of a film, from inception to re-birth as a cult masterpiece, that I've ever seen. Pulling no punches, the cast and crew candidly discuss the troubled production, on-and-off-set misadventures, and the constant war between vision and budget.<br /><br />Finally, the fourth disc offers a wide variety of features delving deeper into the creative forces that produced what would ultimately become \\"Blade Runner\\", and how an 'art house' science fiction film was marketed at a time of more upbeat, audience-friendly productions.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with \\"Blade Runner (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)\\"...but I DO hope this WILL be the last version released!ve forces that produced what would ultimately become \\"Blade Runner\\", and how an 'art house' science fiction film was marketed at a time of more upbeat, audience-friendly productions.

B000J10ERO|2.0|Much discuss has raised around whether or not this is the movie we've have been waiting for. Bryan Singer is an amazing director, no question about that and his approach to the Man of Steel is very good, putting it ''back on track'' as the writers stated. Brandon Routh although not as charismatic as Chris Reeve, does the job and he is actually cool, thou the cape is still too big for him. Very cool special effects but...not outstanding!    The movie did not live up to the studio's expectations so what went wrong? The problem is very simple: The difference between Singer's style and Michael Bay's for example is obvious: Singer shows slow paced action and Bay shows super high speed paced action. When we see Superman in action in the animated series and Justice League fighting and providing excitement you get entertainment. This movie fails to provide exactly that: action!!! That cheap talk about the sequel being that fast paced is just an excuse to say: ''sorry! We missed that here''. Being that we already had Superman-Doomsday where we see kicking butts this movie is all but disappointing. There is too much romance, cheesy, boring, and swamping. A boy who distracts Superman for what he really is: Earth's greatest hero. !! Oh and by the way: Is there another movie where the super hero had a son taking into account Supergirl, Reeve's Superman saga, X-Men, Dare Devil, Hulk, Electra, Wonder Woman, Flash or any other? No!!!! Simply no! That is nothing but stupid. Superman is defeated TWICE by Lex and by the huge landmass. He was treated by doctors in a hospital. I mean, give me a break! If this happened to him in this movie, Darkseid or Brainiac would simply clean the floor with him.     They tried to humanize the hero, which is ok but too much melodrama and not action which leads to this: annoying. Actors playing fools like Kitty (in resemblance to miss Teschmacher) and betraying Lex...c'mon...the Lex from Smallville simply wipes them out of Earth but here this one justplays funny. A criminal mastermind playing funny! That is but absurd. There are many elements (like Cyclops) that are annoying, distracting and boring, just because they are friends with Singer. Singer owns to the fans, not to his friends. So my Superman fans, kudos to Bryan Singer for his interpretation but we demand ACTION, FAST SECUENCES! That is why it failed with the studio. If you see X-MEN III although not the best of the trilogy it has action and fights. Because a super hero movie in a drama format simply does not work. So if you are a Superman fan as well as I am go and get it, it has some entertainment and good subjects but if you are waiting for THE MOVIE, that it still has to come. They thought they got the movie but did not take into account how much the animated movies have developed the character, not to mention Smallville too. Hopefully they will exploit what this is really about in the sequel; otherwise the Superman character will be, as in the movie, defeated. Even worse the heroe, for the fans and generations to come, might be forgotten due to a boring ultra romantic stupid movie.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|There are so many things I could say about Sara Bareilles, but really, there isn't a lot that needs to be said; especially when you present her music. I remember the first time that I heard her, when she opened for Marc Broussard back in early 2005, and I had never heard of her. I am not exaggerating in the least when I say that I was completely moved. To this day, I have never seen such raw talent as this displayed so effortlessly on stage. Sara completely owned her element, and delivered song after song.     After a few years of eagerly waiting, she finally released this gem of a debut, and I will fully admit, that it cemented her as one of my favorite artists. This is a record that comes along maybe once in a decade; a record that is moving, poignant, well written, masterfully produced, and wholly enjoyable. From the first note of Love Song, to the last emphatic emotion of Gravity, Sara completely pours herself into her craft, and the result is music that very few are capable of making.    If you are looking for the definition of amazing, you have found it. I have been listening for a while now, and I am not stopping any time soon.
0743554450|5.0|I'm not sure how Amazon categorizes their reviews here, I see a lot of reviews for the actual book and not the audio book.  I just want to be clear that I listened to the book and didn't read it.  That being said, I loved it.  I didn't know what the book was about at all before I hit play on my Ipod, I just knew it had gotten a lot of acclaim and was free from the library.  If you had told me it was about oppressed Afghani women I wouldn't have even bothered, I'm usually not into that kind of stuff.  I'm glad no one told me, I was engaged by the story and the characters situations.  I found myself getting emotionally charged a number of times while listening to it.  I have no idea how well this represents the \\"real\\" Afghanistan or compares to any of his other books.  I do know that what I thought would take a week to listen to took two days.  The narration was great, the woman read very smoothly and it was sooting to the ears to listen to.  My fiancee probably got a little annoyed with me sitting with my head phones on all weekend.  Coming from someone who would normally consider this subject matter a little too Politically Correct (for lack of a better description) I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'm looking forward to listening to the Kite Runner in the future now.
B000UJ48U4|1.0|Usually, my husband and I disagree on films, but when it came to this one, we both wholeheartedly agree it was nothing but a load of crappola!    Once again, I am shocked by all the glowing reviews.    We think Stanley Kubrick was just having a laugh.  The story was ridiculous, slow moving and eventually uninteresting.    The acting was laugh inducing...Tom Cruise wasn't too bad, but Nicole Kidmans performance was truly embarrasing! Her rendition of someone high from pot was so bad, and so funny it made the whole thing worth watching because we laughed our heads off.    Truly bad film, anyone who thinks this is something it's not is very gullable.  BTW - it's not even erotic!
0143038419|3.0|My book club chose this book and I was really excited about it after reading some initial reviews.  People who travel the world and have a sense of humor always appeal to me.  I must admit, however, that it took me a while to get into the book.  If it weren't for the club, I might have abandoned it.    I'm fascinated by her journey and identify with her, as she battles depression.  A lot of people seem to resent her for the blessings in her life and belittle her struggles.  There are a variety of reasons why she may have chosen not to elaborate on the problems in her marriage.    The purpose of this story is to chronicle a journey of healing, not justify a divorce.  Gilbert does this with honesty and humor.  Yes, she can be shallow, but I don't know anyone who isn't shallow to some degree.  If taken as a memoir or travelogue, rather than a guidebook or advice column, it accomplishes that task quite well.  Whether you find her to be an enjoyable companion is another matter.  Personally, I believe that she would be an enjoyable aquaintence, as she claims: an entertaining conversation partner who puts you at ease from the get-go.    That said, I enjoyed her account of her time in India, mostly enjoyed her time in Italy, and was ready to part ways in Bali.  I did not like the people she met there and found little value in what she accomplished.  Ending the book with her Brazilian lover felt superficial, like a dissatisfying romance novel.  I understand it's difficult to wrap up a significant year in one's life, and perhaps that was truly the best note to end on.  Life does not always offer the perfect, meaningful event for our narrative.    A Chacun Son Gout!  I liked it, but this is not likely to join my re-read list.
1416914293|5.0|The sequel to City of Bones (Mortal Instruments) is great!  I thought this book was great, in it's character development and story line.  In this first book, you were only privied to Clary's point of view.  However, in the second book you get story told from Jace, Clary, Simon, and newcomer Maia.  I think this was fantastic, because you were able to see how Jace saw Valentine and how hard it is for him to turn his back on his father.  You are also able to see how feels about Clary.  In the first, you knew how she felt about him and you figured he felt the same, especially in the end, but in the second, you knew exactly how he felt.<br /><br />The chapter with the Seelie Court, the next 3 chapters, and the ending chapters are the best of the whole book and leaves you with many questions.  I can't wait to see if some of my ideas turn out to be true or if they, like all my other ideas, fall flat.  A must read for any paranormal fan.
B0002IQEHI|1.0|When I tried to watch this DVD, once it got to about half way through, it began to skip badly.  It never got past the skip and I was not able to watch the movie until the end.  I took the DVD out of the player and saw that it had a big scratch in it.  I knew it was used when I bought it, but I guess I had hoped I would be able to actually watch the movie.  I'm going to try and run it through a scratch repair machine.  If that doesn't fix it, I guess I'll have to send it back.
1591841992|5.0|Roam does a solid job of walking you through the visual learning using \\"the back of the napkin\\" as a useful metaphor. Many of us have used \\"the back of a napkin\\" to make a point. Roam examines the efficiency of communication using diagrams, drawings, illustrations and other visual aids. Worth reading and even more - worth practicing!
B000K4WPCC|2.0|This movie aspires to be a current \\"Lost Boys\\" but the acting is not on the par of Sutherland and Haim. Although it is watchable I found myself wanting to fast forward through a couple points wanting it to get more interesting. The storyline of Warlocks and Witches with magical powers living around one of the old colonizing areas is not new. There take on it wasn't bad, just not original. The acting was fair but not good or outstanding. So overall if you enjoy this type movie I highly recommend you rent it before dropping any money on it. Good quality DVD with very low replayability.
6305428220|4.0|The 90s were an interesting time for the horror genre; the 90s started off on a down note for horror flicks, while there were plenty of one that were successful it seemed like there were more misses. The days of the franchises were all, but over as they finally ran out of steam and the audience weren't really responding to them as well. The filmmakers who shaped the genre in the 70s and 80s were now falling on tough times. New franchises started and most ended up going direct to video. But than Kevin Williamson came along and bought horror back big time. Like his work or not at one point this guy was the biggest thing in horror and really shook things up. Suddenly well known TV actors were now starring in horror flicks something that was never possible in the 80s and even some well known film stars did horror. While I prefer a cast of unknowns or cult actors, point is Williamson changed a lot in the genre.<br /><br />The Faculty is the typical horror flick from this point in the 90s; the stylized hey look at us we're so smart and cool era made famous by Kevin Williamson. At this point in his career Kevin Williamson was red hot. All the screenplays he wrote were huge hits and spawned several knock offs and his TV work like Dawson's Creek became the latest teen sensation. I'll confess Kevin Williamson's movies are sort of guilty pleasures. In particular they aren't my kind of horror, but I do enjoy watching his movies again his flicks are my guilty pleasures. He found a formula that worked and rode it out until the end.<br /><br />The Faculty is a high school version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and there are many references to the Body Snatcher movies and novel as well. I'm a sucker for the Body Snatcher movies I love them all and no many how many remakes come I'll watch them. Most people will cite Scream as Williamson's best work as a writer, but I'm going with The Faculty. All that made Scream so popular is here, but at times it felt a little forced where as The Faculty it doesn't seem so forced. I thought this was well written and with excellent if not clich&eacute;d characters, which I believe was intentional.<br /><br />Besides Invasion of the Body Snatchers there is also a homage to The Thing as well. If Scream was his homage to slasher flicks, The Faculty was Williamson's homage to Alien Invasion movies. The characters as stated are clich&eacute;d, but they work well actually and are all quite likeable. They are well developed and in some ways all add to the plot. Again most people will cite Scream as his best, but I have to go with The Faculty. In a sense all of Williamson's scripts are almost a rewrite of each other. They all follow the same formula, but they were all mostly well written.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez is one of my favorite directors and he does an excellent job here. The pacing of the film is very well done. The plot or characters always move forward and honestly there is never really a dull moment. Something is always happening to keep the viewer hooked on the movie. The Faculty does lack the thrills and chills of the Body Snatcher movies, but there is some decent suspense and tension to be found. At this time in horror everything was very Hollywood stylized made for a new crowd and people like me were pretty much left out, but The Faculty is one of the very best from the Williamson era.<br /><br />The Faculty is a slight letdown is the sense I did expect more from Robert Rodriguez in the thrills and chills department, but that is actually the one real fault in the script. Everything is so hip and cool I suppose that is why it gets lost so for me that is the only flaw in the script. But there is some decent suspense and tension at times and probably better than most of these Hollywood horror flicks at the time, but I did expect more from Robert Rodriguez, but regardless he does do an excellent job at keeping the pace moving and always keeps the movie a lot of fun.<br /><br />About my only complaintis in the final act when we find out who the main alien is we see him or her out of human form. I don't know for me it just didn't work. The saying sometimes what you don't see is better and in this case I think that's true. For me the alien out of human form just didn't fully work. But it's not something that ruins the movie. The Faculty is still enjoyable, but I would have preferred the alien to stay in human form.<br /><br />The Faculty is a product of it's time. Every element of 90s horror is here though a lot has changed since this type of flick is a thing of the past now. But despite my problem with the movies of this era, The Faculty is in my opinion one of the better flicks from that time. The casting is solid and all the actors provide solid performances. I actually liked all the characters and found myself rooting for them to survive.<br /><br />Who knew this would mark the end of the Kevin Williamson era? While it may not have lasted long it did revive the horror genre and start a new trend even if what in spawned was mostly lousy with some exceptions. After this, Williamson would fail at the box office as a writer and producer and his TV shows didn't make it out of their first season. Kind of weird how at one moment he's box office gold and TV ratings gold and the next moment everything is a flop. Overall The Faculty despite being Hollywood stylized is in my opinion a very enjoyable take on Invasion of the Body Snatchers.we see him or her out of human form.

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|If you enjoy epic battles then this movie should move you. The fact there is a good storyline with it won't hide the fact this is a movie about epic men and women and great bloody battles. I must say though the gore was not overdone as in some movies. This is no worse than \\"Ben Hur\\" or some other of that caliber. I enjoyed it thoroughly since I thought the casting and acting was great. The love stories and tradgedies follow the true stories fairly well. The timeline is a bit askew but we are no worse off for that. We get the overall story and see where the lines \\"Beware Greeks Bearing Gifts\\" and \\"Achilles Heel\\" come from.<br /><br />There are those that would think Brad Pitt was not right for the part of Achilles, but if that was so, he did a fine job of making it his part. His fights were choregraphed meticuously and are worth seeing the movie for alone. The detailed methods of fighting showed me some moves that I had not seen in this type movie before but make perfect since to me. Afterall a moving target is hard to hit, and Achilles moves very well. I recommend it if you enjoy this type movie. Personally I like these real people movies over the CGI types. You can feel their sweat and blood. I think most the family can watch this as it is no different in theme than many of the classic sword and sandal movies. Excellent quality DVD with good replayability.

0452289963|5.0|This is one of the best spiritual and enlightening books of our times.  Eckhart Tolles \\"A New Earth\\" describes what it is like to be an ego driven society on the brink of disaster and therefore much change to secure our survival of as a species.  But it's more then that, it teaches us how to deal with our painful existence and to be just present in the moment, not looking towards our future our past, just be in the now.  It's a wonderful book, that has awakened me to enjoy my life right now!

B000ZN802W|5.0|I wanted a break from reading and found this at Blockbuster.  Initially I was amused because it seemed to embody every cliche from the top ten feel good movies I have watched over the last 30 years, but I ended up taking notes and two in particular stand out:<br /><br />WOW when he cuts into the wild<br /><br />I truly respect and even *love* this movie.<br /><br />It never occurred to me that it was Sean Penn doing the acting until I read some of the other reviews--so a complement: Sean Penn the actor was completely obscured by the actual protagonist.<br /><br />There are lines of poetry throughout the movie that I imagine must be credited to the original creative spirit that crafted the story, although Sean Penn himself did the screenplay, so one cannot be certain where the original work ended and Sean Penn's own brand of magic began.<br /><br />Here are a few lines that I noted down:<br /><br />When he encounters an older hippie couple:<br /><br />\\"This hippie thing is not working--some people feel they don't deserve love.\\"<br /><br />\\"When you kill (a wild animal) get to it fast, once the flies and creepy crawlers are on it....\\"<br /><br />\\"A murder of truth....\\"<br /><br />Now, *without disdain* but rather with appreciation, here are the movies from the past that I found lightly inter-mingled in spirit within this one:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000059TEQ Love Story]]<br />[[ASIN:B0001GF2H4 Dances with Wolves (Full Screen Theatrical Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000062XGD Cast Away (Full-Screen Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00000F798 The Graduate (40th Anniversary Collector's Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005U2KD Summer of '42]]<br />[[ASIN:B000AU9UYC Batman Begins (Full Screen Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000062XG0 The Man From Snowy River]]<br />[[ASIN:6305144168 Dead Poets Society]]<br />[[ASIN:B00008CMR5 A Man Called Horse]]<br />[[ASIN:B00003CWL6 American Beauty (Widescreen Edition)]]<br /><br />My last word on this movie:  Poetry!

B000UNYJXQ|3.0|I like The work of Mickael Moore, but it's not documentaries where you expose different points of view...<br />His piece is mainly about one point of view, that's a little awkward<br />I'm ok with the idea of universal social security but it's good in a documentary to hear from both sides, the ones who are for it and the ones who are against it (is there any??).<br />And not all the french have a 8000 euros monthly income...so be careful about the foreign examples...they are not wrong but that's an easy example, it's like asking Paris Hilton if she can afford surgery!!!<br />But beside that, i think the demonstration is quite good...

159562015X|3.0|Of the 175 pages, the first 30 are intro/overview fluff. Then you're instructed to complete a 30-minute online assessment, for which you'll need the unique, one-use-only code in the back of your book. This assessment will leave you with your top 5 strengths.     For each strength, you'll also see (online) an overview of that strength, brief testimonials from people with that strength, 10 ideas for action, and a few tips on how to work with others who have that strength.      There are 34 strengths, overall - and the remaining 145 pages of the book go through each strength, with the same exact overview/ testimonials/ ideas for action/ tips that you'd see online.     So, purchasing the book is worth it for the quiz - but really, they should just charge you for the online code and leave it at that. The book itself is kind of a waste.
B000A6T262|5.0|This review is short and to the point - if you are looking to obtain all the Star Trek movies, this is the way to do it.  It is cost-effective and you get all the Star Trek movies made to date.  I haven't looked at the second disc of any of the movies, but they all come with the main movie disc and a second features disc.  I bought it for the movies themselves and didn't care about special features discs.  Each movie comes in its own DVD case.  At $7.20 per movie, the price and convenience of an all-in-one set is hard to beat.

B0009HARUW|3.0|Review by Sherry North, Author, [[ASIN:0810994828 Because You Are My Baby]]<br /><br />Eric Carle is a favorite in our house, but this is one of his weaker titles. The illustration of the spider spinning her web barely changes from one page to the next, and there's no clever twist that \\"makes\\" the book, like in A Very Hungry Caterpillar. After reading it to our son once, he never seemed interested in looking at it again - but he does ask for Carle's other books often.
B000O599WG|5.0|This is a Western (Waynestern) that people either love or dismiss.  I love it.  For me, many of the things people complain about are its virtues.  John Wayne has an important role as Sheriff John T. Chance, but there is plenty of room for the other stars.  Dean Martin gives one of his better performances as Dude.  Martin shows some real depth as a drunk trying to find his way back.  Ricky Nelson was such a youngster, but he pulls off the role of the outsider who finally has to pick a side and joins the right team.  I have to tell you, though, that seeing him light all those cigarettes, well, I can imagine that it caused a bit of a scandal back then.  While I don't have any direct memory of it, he was such a teen idol that I can't imagine that parents were seeing him smoking at 18.<br /><br />Angie Dickinson was spectacular as Feathers.  She was amazingly beautiful, but not in a model or dollhouse way.  In many ways, Feathers is Slim Browning from \\"To Have and Have Not\\" and more than a few of her scenes are obviously based on scenes from that movie.  Howard Hawks admits it, many critics have noted it, and even Angie Dickinson has commented on her discovering it years later when watching the movie on TV.<br /><br />Remember, back in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, movies were not brought back to the theaters very often and were not yet played on television (at least not much) until the 60s.  So, reusing effective plots and dialogue would only make sense.  Many have noted that Hawks tweaked the plot of this movie in \\"El Dorado\\" and \\"Rio Lobo\\".  The similarities are easy to spot.  Does this make them lesser movies?  I don't think so.  Does Handel's having reused earlier compositions to create \\"Messiah\\" so quickly diminish the majesty, beauty, and popularity of that oratorio?  Of course not!  They are just products of a certain time and set of cultural expectations.<br /><br />The opening scene of the movie (almost five minutes long) has not a single word and is wonderfully effective.  Dude (Dean Martin) is obviously sick for some whiskey and thinks he is being offered a drink, but the vicious Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) mocks him by throwing a dollar coin in a spittoon.  As Dude gets down to reach into the slop inside the spittoon to get the dollar, Chance (Wayne) kicks it away.  In the ensuing fight, a man is killed and Burdette is taken into custody.  The central plot of the movie is how Chance, Dude, and Stumpy (Walter Brennan in a marvelous performance) have to hold Joe in the jail while his rich and powerful brother, Nathan (John Russell) tries to spring him.  The several side plots are Dudes struggle with withdrawal from booze, Feathers and Wayne developing a romance, Whether Colorado will join the right side or view the struggle as someone else's problem.<br /><br />Another famous performance from the movie was from the diminutive Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez as Carlos.  Some find his performance too caricatured and politically incorrect, but I think he was just a charming guy that people related to.  I don't see anything in the character to laugh at except his predicaments.  The sight of him against Wayne (more than foot taller) is always a hoot, as well.  There is one more serious scene where Wayne is off the porch and Pedro is on it, so they carry on the dialog more or less eye to eye without any patronization whatsoever.  The Carlos character doesn't run from the fight, either.  He shows up at the last battle with his shotgun and some extra rifle shells for Chance.  That kind of loyalty and bravery is praising the character rather than diminishing him.  Gonzalez Gonzalez just had a special charm and he should be credited for it.<br /><br />The pace of the movie seems slow to modern audiences, but I really enjoy the way the movie develops it characters with conversations not directly tied to the action.  When the action scenes do come the fury and quickness gives them great power without having to resort to gore or extreme violence (although characters are killed in the movie).  Most of the emotional tension comes in scenes setting up the action scenes, which tend to be over quickly.  The final confrontation is a classic and is always fun to watch.<br /><br />A good family film, too.  While the relationship between Feathers and Chance caused some concerns in 1959, but people today would be hard pressed to figure out why.  Besides, it is the way all loner men and their women get along in Westerns, isn't it?<br /><br />The extras on the second disk are quite good.  There is a tribute to the works of Howard Hawks that is most interesting.  Another feature on this movie that I quite enjoyed, and a short on the way Old Tucson has been used in many Westerns past and present.<br /><br />The voice over commentary has Richard Schickel and John Carpenter.  They are not speaking together, but their comments are edited in as appropriate.  Carpenter's comments are more interesting and to the point than Schickel's.  Schickel seems to be talking off the cuff and gets several things wrong.  For example, he says this movie was Hawks' reaction to \\"3:10 to Yuma\\", but Hawks says in the other extras that it was the Sheriff running around for help in \\"High Noon\\" that he disliked so much.  He also says that it is Glenn Ford as the Sheriff in that movie trying to get help to move his prisoner that upset Hawks.  But it is Glenn Ford who is the bad guy and Van Heflin, a failing rancher trying to save his ranch, his marriage, the respect of his boys and himself that leads him to take the risks.  Schickel also notes that Wayne uses a pump action rifle in \\"Rio Bravo\\", but it is obviously a lever action rifle.  I believe it was a Winchester with a short barrel, but I am not a gun hobbyist.  These are small things, but they affect that value of the commentary.  It sounds as if he was just talking off the top of his head without preparation.  My advice; don't do that.<br /><br />The color of the movie looks great and I recommend this movie and extras very much.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MIlthough characters are killed in the movie).

Missed this one during school and read all three of Herriot's books in my 40's.  Truly lovely, wise, and transporting.  I will make sure my children don't wait as long as I did to discover these classics.
0452286751|5.0|The Fountainhead is an epic story between good and evil. It details the life of the unrecognized genius of protagonist Howard Roark and his struggle against the cunning and evil Ellsworth Toohey. Howard Roark is an unconventional and creative architect whose style is not commonly accepted among the masses. The book eloquently recounts his battle to make people see beyond the materialistic opinions of others and think for themselves. Ayn Rand truly highlights her controversial philosophy in a way that truly envelopes you in her world. However, this book is not just a philosophical revelation. It also recounts the turbulent relationship between him and Dominique, a beautiful yet violent daughter of one the most successful architects in New York City. This book has captured one of the most twisted and exciting love triangles of all time. Though heavy and slow - going at times I truly enjoyed The Fountainhead. It has achieved its ultimate purpose - to change the way I think about the world and the purpose of my life. I would recommend this book to nearly everybody. For if you cannot extract life long lessons from this novel, you will at least walk away with the ultimate story of evil, romance, and the triumph of the human will.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien series got better than ever in this deluxe collection that remastered and extended the saga; I don't know if it was the enhacements, the benefit of seeing all four movies in close proximity to one another, or just being able to appreciate certain aspects more now than in the mid-80s thru mid-90s, but when I saw the movies from this collected edition they were, as a whole, significantly better this time around.  The only one to come off slightly Lesser than on previous views was, ironically, \\"Aliens\\" - often hailed as the best of the lot - although that had more to do with certain points that were easy to miss in among all the action but, on subsequent viewings, show up a couple of inconsistencies.  More on that later.      The original \\"Alien\\" was great the first time around, but is one of those movies that gets even better with the hindsight provided by the sequels.  One noticable upon the rewatch is that \\"Alien Vs. Predator\\" actually patched its prequel status in very well with the hints way back in 1979's original that the company that owned the salvage ship had been looking for something specific all along, and already knew what the Xenomorphs were.  Alien was revolutionary in the scale and realism of its effects, in its own way as groundbreaking as fellow 70s space smash \\"Star Wars\\", and revolutionary in blending the science fiction movie and the horror movie more perfectly than ever before.  The single alien creature immediately established itself as one of moviedom's most memorable monsters, and nothing about the deadly potency of that one creature has been diminished by follow-ups that featured swarms of the Xenomorphs.  All the previously excised bits that have been added back in fit extremely well and make the whole better.  The only potential quibble to be found is this: of all the remarkable traits displayed by the Alien, perhaps the most stunning was its phenomenal growth rate (I mean, how long did it take it to go from burstling stage to full-grown armored adult?).  And yet I can't remember any of the characters even really noticing the seeming impossibility of this, although a lot of time is spent covering such aspects as the Xenomoph's possession of acid for blood.  I'm not saying they should have taken that characteristic out, or necessarily even extended its time frame, but at least having some comments by the characters on the most extraordinary of the creature's lifecycle characteristics would have been a help.  Overall, it didn't do much to detract from the overall movie though.       \\"Aliens\\" amps the whole thing up.  After the original had a single alien take on a small salvage crew, this one has an entire space colony threatened by a veritable army of the creatures.  Ripley, having returned to Earth after 57 years in deep-sleep,attempts to settle into as normal a life as possible.  Some time later, the company officials who initially were very disbelieving about her claims of aliens and a crashed mothership out on that barren planet, comes to her.  A colony is located on that very world, and all contact has very abruptly broken off, and they want her, purely as a 'precaution', to accompany the team they're sending off to check it out.  \\"Aliens\\" smartly contrasted the overwhelming prescence of the Xenomorphs in the second half of the movie by an almost total lack of the creatures in the first hour or so, allowing everything time to build up nicely.  \\"Aliens\\" introduced some of the series's most memorable characters, including perrennial fan favorites Newt (the little girl survivor, played by Carrie Henn) and Bishop (Lance Henrikson).  The Cpl. Hicks character (action-sf stalwart Michael Biehn) also added a lot to the show.  Awesome special effects are a high point.  Biggest flaw: inconsistency.  Take the acidic blood of the Xenomorphs.  There are times when even a small amount can do hideous, lethal damage to a human, but at other times when the battles are raging and the heavy machine guns are firing all over the place, you've got multiple aliens exploding in close proximity to various characters and they don't seem to suffer significant damage.  You could counterargue that different 'castes' or whatever of Xenomorphs have different bloodtypes, but that seems a bit contrived; and that situation is symbolic of inconsistencies that crop up a couple of times to mildly hinder an otherwise excellent movie.      \\"Alien 3\\" is the most under-rated of the original quadrilogy, crashing a ship from the previous film on a remote prison planet where a bizarre socity complete with its own religion has sprung up.  It heads in the opposite direction of \\"Aliens\\", drastically reducing the Xenomorphs's numbers and leaving the human characters with only makeshift weapons (compared to the large high-tech arsenals of the space marines from \\"Aliens\\").  All the Alien movies are hybrids of various genres and styles, but if the first is the most 'science fiction'-al of them and the second fits neatest under the action movie banner, \\"Alien 3\\" is the most horror movie oriented of the collection.  Phenomenal effects, high-caliber acting and characterization and a whopper of a finale.      \\"Alien: Resurrection\\" is the most flawed of the lot but still a very good movie; I enjoyed it much more when I saw it again than when I first saw the VHS a couple weeks afer its release. Fewer people have seen Alien 3 than the first two and therefore might not know the ending, making it harder to comment on this one without giving away Part 3's surprises.  The movie focuses on the corporation finally getting hold of actual Xenomorphs to begin work on their ultimate goal of turning them into biological weapons.  It's probably not giving anything away to say that the project doesn't go as the company had hoped.  Instead of going more into the plot I'll focus on the movie's strengths and weaknesses.  Strengths: a continued pattern of strong acting and well-done characters, with Annalee (Winona Ryder) being especially effective; tremendous effects for the creatures (including a radically new breed); an unexpectedly potent follow-up to the thread from the 'hive' scene in \\"Aliens\\" that implied that there actually is an emotional bond between at least some of the Xenomorphs.  Weaknesses: pretty glaring inconsistencies and implausibilities in the action, much more so than in \\"Aliens\\" (I'd cite examples but I'm running out of wordcount).       Overall, Alien is 4.5 stars, maybe even 5; \\"Aliens\\" is four stars, \\"Alien 3\\" a 5-star, and \\"Alien: Resurrection\\" 3-and-a-half stars.  I should round my mark to four but it's hard to resist giving this a five.  Having them all together like this makes the whole even greater than the sum of its parts.  The packaging is great, there's tonnes of bonus features for those who like them (personally I don't like going behind the scenes and seeing how something is made, although I did enjoy the short director introductions before each film), and it's currently going for $30 for NINE discs, which is pretty bloody impressive.  An essential for fans of horror, science fiction and action.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Every philosophy student should watch this movie!!  The characters can be seen as dialectic interlocutors representing different shades of morality.  This film is definitely among the more unique in our time.  It is as exciting as Indiana Jones, but is layered with deep philosophical complexities and moral ambiguities that many modern art house films don't even get quite right.    As most people know, this film grew out of a short-lived series called Firefly, which, admittedly, I didn't know about before this film but have since watched in its entirety.  It is set in the future, in a post-war Reconstruction-esque Era where several worlds are run by the Alliance, a Sino-American, culturally fused mega-government that is, after all, just trying to make a better world.  The numerous system of worlds governed by the Alliance have forced them to spread their presence thin, leaving wiggle room for fringe settlers to live by their own laws (or lack thereof), similar to the American frontier era.    Malcolm Reynolds is captain of the Serenity, a firefly class space vessel that is as iconic as the Millennium Falcon or the Black Pearl.  He fought for the browncoats, a resistance group who fought against the Alliance in the Unification War.  I'd coin the term \\"vicarious schizophrenic\\" just for Mal.  He's that complicated a character!  For the crew with which Mal has surrounded himself, I would make the argument, are a complex of Mal's many manifested personalities:    Zoe - the Spartan who never diverts from her sense of purpose.  Wash - the light-hearted adventurous pirate, filled with wanderlust.  Kaylee - the suppressed inner child, innocent but adaptable and capable.  Jayne - the churlish brigand, always calculating his advantages in any situation.  Simon Tam - a man of moral purpose with a deep hatred for the Alliance, who abandoned a potentially comfortable life to resist the Alliance, who victimized his sister.  River Tam - an otherwise gifted individual, twisted into something dark by the Alliance.  Shepherd Book - warrior/preacher searching for cosmic purpose, who explores a realm where Mal himself won't venture, but who comes to teach Mal that belief doesn't necessarily have to involve something spiritual.  Inara - a high class courtesan and Mal's soul mate, whom he petulantly alienates (implying Mal's self-hatred).    The dialogue in this movie rivals some of the best I've ever seen on film.  It delves so deeply into the fabric of humanity and all of its moral dilemmas.  Here are a few examples (disclaimers: I did my best to be exact.  I've only seen this movie three times, so please forgive any inaccuracies):    (my personal favorite!)  Mal: Half of writing history is hiding the truth.    (while experiencing a rough landing)  Mal: Just get us on the ground!    Wash: That part will happen pretty definitely!    (before the payroll robbery)  Mal: I don't plan on any shooting taking place on this job.    Jayne: Yeah, but what you plan and what takes place ain't exactly been similar.    (Simon protesting River's involvement in the payroll robbery)  Simon: Do you understand what I've gone through to protect River from the Alliance?    Mal: I do.  It's a fact we here have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves.    Simon: Are you threatening me?    Mal: I look out for me and mine. That don't include you unless I conjure it does.  Now you stuck a thorn in the Alliance's paw.  That tickles me a bit.  But it also means I have to step twice as fast to avoid them.  And that means turning down plenty of jobs.  Even honest ones.  Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us to slip about at all.  This job goes south, there well may not be another.  So here is us, on the raggedy edge.  Don't push me, and I won't push you.    (during the payroll robbery)  Mal: I see a head rise, violence is going to ensue. Probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we're after here is not yours. So, let's have no undue fuss.(after rescuing Inara from the Operative)  Inara: This isn't a war, Mal.  You came to that training house looking for a fight.                     Mal: I came looking for you.                       Inara: I just want to know who I'm dealing with.  I've seen too many versions of you to be sure.                       Mal: I start fighting a war, I guarantee you'll see something new.    (after realizing the Alliance is hunting River Tam)  Shepherd: You have a plan?    Mal: What, hiding ain't a plan?    (Later in that conversation)  Mal: I could've left her there.  I had an out.  Hell, I had every reason in the `verse to haul anchor.    Shepherd: it's not your way, Mal.    Mal: I have a way?  Is that better than having a plan?    (before the story's climax)  Mal: You all got on this boat for different reasons, but you all come to the same place.  So now I'm asking more of you than I have before.  Sure as I know anything, I know this.  They will try again. Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean.  A year from now.  Maybe ten.  They'll swing back to the belief that they can make people better.  And I do not hold to that.  So no more running.  I aim to misbehave.    There are many, many more that I have omitted.  This story could be used as a study on human nature and a makeshift morality achieved through dialectic.  There is nobody here that is essentially good or essentially bad.  Instead evil is represented by the Alliance, which is really no more than a metaphor for how badly a seemingly benevolent ideology can be twisted.  A core belief held by the Alliance is that, as Mal stated, they can make people better, the opposing viewpoint being that humanity should be free from such intervention, no matter how bad it might get.  We have been seeing a similar struggle play out globally since the Cold War in the two forms of state governance that have dominated the world since then, and in our attempts to spread the ideals therein by force when deemed necessary.  Exactly who is right has not been determined, and I don't think ever will be.  Atrocities have been perpetrated by all sides.  Mankind will continue ever to find its moral equilibrium within the many shades between right and wrong, and struggles such as Mal's and the crew of Serenity will be those that punctuate the very essence of it all.  The story of Serenity always was and always will be the story of mankind, in its largeness and its smallness.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|I am a huge fan of the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder, so I was skeptical about this 2005 remake.  While Burton's film doesn't match the brilliance of Stuart's classic it does have its moments and there are many redeeming qualities.  It does differ drastically from the `71 film, which is probably a good thing in that it can't find itself chastised too much for failing to live up, for in the end it views like a completely different movie.  Both films were based on Roald Dahl's book, although it was made clear that Dahl disapproved of the `71 film.<br /><br />The basis or foundation of this film is the same as the previous.  A young poor boy finds a golden ticket that gives him the chance to tour the Chocolate Factory of one Willy Wonka.  He's accompanied by his grandfather as well as four other children and their parents, all of which have some very undesirable personality traits.  Their `flaws' so-to-speak end up costing them a great deal in the long run as they make their way through the wacky and crazy factory.<br /><br />`Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is considerably lighter fare than `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. This has a lot to do with the difference in approach that both Depp and Wilder took to the character of Willy Wonka.  Depp is much more comical and slapstick than Wilder was.  I much prefer Wilder's performance for he added layers of darkness and I think in the end it was his performance that elevated the true morale that this story sets out to embrace.  Depp, looking scarily like Michael Jackson (don't even begin to try and say that he wasn't an inspiration), is hilarious and he proves yet again he is a true chameleon, but I just don't think that his performance is as iconic as Wilder's.<br /><br />What was a nice improvement were the performances given by the child actors here.  All five of them really shine.  We all know that young Freddie Highmore can act; just watch his marvelous performance in `Finding Neverland' (can you say OSCAR SNUB).  Here he is charming and sweet.  AnnaSophia Robb, dubbed the next Dakota Fanning, delivers a very strong performance that sets her apart as `best in show' in my opinion as far as the child actors go.  Julia Winter is also on point and convincing.  Jordan Fry is supremely obnoxious, truly commanding and while Philip Wiegratz isn't really given much to work with, he works well with it.  The parts of the parents are also played well.  Missi Pyle (hilarious), James Fox, Adam Godley and Franziska Troegner are all decent here.  David Kelly is good as Grandpa Joe, although I just loved Jack Albertson's performance.  I wish that Helena Bonham Carter would have had a heftier role, but just looking at her is enough for me sometimes.<br /><br />What can't be denied is the fact that Tim Burton's imagination is boundless.  Visually `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is flawless.  Everything is lush and rich.  That is the biggest draw to this remake; it is a visual masterpiece.  The sets, the costumes, the candy; it is all marvelously created and embellished.  It reminds me in parts of what `Alice in Wonderland' would look like brought to the big screen once again (let's pitch that idea to Tim Burton...with maybe AnnaSophia Robb as Alice...).<br /><br />The biggest drawback to `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' though is the horrendous new songs and musical numbers.  What I found so irritating is the fact that you can't understand a single word Deep Roy is uttering.  I loved the original songs.  I was depressed they had changed them.  They were messy and sloppy and horrendous.<br /><br />In the end I think that `Charlie and Chocolate Factory' may delight more children then the original film did.  This is much lighter and more campy that the Stuart masterpiece.  While Stuart's vision I feel was much more mature and controversial and in the end elicits much more conversation I feel that Burton and Depp understood their audience here and created an above-average familyfilm that is delightful to say the least.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|I'm a big sci-fi fan and a huge Stargate fan ... have watched it from day one. I agree completely with the review written by Captain Hornblower \\"captainhornblower\\", so I won't repeat what the Captain said. I will add a little though. Since this was a made-for-DVD movie, one would have expected something more than what ended up being a 1hr 40min TV show without commercials. All the acting was terrific as usual, and the special affects were great, and the subtle humor moments were classic Stargate, but the plot was just gone. It was as if the writers handed over the job of writing the plot as a 9th-grade class assignment. As the Captain said, \\"too simple\\"! The whole Ori problem has been a really cool idea in the last season of SG1, and this movie was the perfect opportunity to continue the cool Ori story, but it just fizzled out.
1892005034|4.0|I received this book for free at a communication studies conference, and didn't think much of it.  Then I started reading it.    The book is meant to be a handbook for carring on day to day communication with people in your life in a nonviolent way, which is defined as not passing judgment, making accusations, etc.      The downside?  The formula the book describes can seem a bit cheesy and mechanical at first. The scripts suggested are fairly specific and involve some langauge that will strike many as sort of garden-variety touchy-feely stuff (\\"When you say that, what I hear you saying is that . . .\\").    But the underlying ideas about the importance of empathy, the unproductive nature of approaching communication (even argument) as adversarial, and the basic human decency that lies beneath the concepts are more important and can't be trivialized by what might seem like hokey language.    Thorough-going cynics will not enjoy the book, but others will find some new ideas (and reminders of some basic common sense) that are useful.    BTW, thre are a number of books that make some similar points, but do so using a martial arts analogy (which might seem odd, but is actually in keeping with the \\"nonviolent\\" ethos of this book).  You might look at \\"Aikido for Everyday Life\\" and/or \\"Verbal Judo,\\" particularly if \\"Nonviolent Communication\\" sounds like it's just a bit too, well, wussy for you.
B00008FRMM|5.0|This arrived exactly like the description said very well preserved record and it sounds great not a problem with it.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I am thoroughly confused by the abundance of negative comments directed towards this film.  Yes, the ending was shocking and maybe a little too much for some.  My response to \\"ticked off Mom\\" with her disturbed teenagers, as well as many others is simply this: \\"Don't watch hard \\"R\\" material and stick to Disney films or whatever is safe for you in your Mr. Rogers land of make-believe. I am not trying to insult anyone here, it just seems to me that it is pointless to watch a Rated R or NC17 film and then whine because it doesn't have a nice, neat, HAPPY ending. Real life is not like that, so what do we want filmmakers to do, Lie?  Art is only a projection of our own screwed up psyche and violent world.    The Special Effects were excellent and I am pleased to see that KNB and CafeFX were able to meld both of their talents to create some of the most bizarre and horrifying creatures ever put on film.  The acting was right on and I was happy to see that Darabont did not ruin the film by placing teeny bopper Television and Music stars in various roles.  Honestly, I can think of nothing but praise to extend to Darabont, KNB, CafeFX, all the actors and actresses, producers, crew people, etc. and of course Stephen King, the greatest writer of all time.  Thanks guys!  [[ASIN:B0010X73ZG The Mist (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]

B0013D8LOU|5.0|An R rated musical about a vengeful barber who kills his victims only to serve them up as meat pies must've made the studio a little nervous to bankroll a big budget adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's award-winning Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Although, they must've been reassured that Tim Burton would be helming the project with his long-time collaborator Johnny Depp stepping in to play Todd. Burton, with his affinity for all things dark and gothic (see [[ASIN:6305949980 The Nightmare Before Christmas (Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000C3L27U Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition)]]), seems like an obvious choice to take on such dark subject matter and Sondheim agreed, giving the filmmaker his blessing.<br /><br />The first disc has a featurette entitled, \\"Burton + Depp + Carter = Todd.\\" Tim Burton had always been a fan of Stephen Sondheim's musical and had contemplated a film version for years. Helena Bonham Carter was also a fan and had always wanted to play Mrs. Lovett. Burton liked the idea of her and Depp as this \\"weird\\" couple. The director and his leading man talk about their long-standing relationship in this excellent featurette.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with the \\"Sweeney Todd Press Conference, November 2007\\" which features Burton, producer Richard Zanuck and his main cast answering questions from the press. Not surprisingly, Burton and Depp tend to dominate the bulk of the questions. Both men are very charming and joke good naturedly with each other.<br /><br />\\"Musical Mayhem: Sondheim's Sweeney Todd\\" features Sondheim talking about the origins of his take on Sweeney Todd and what drew him to the story. He also talks about how he adapted it into a musical and speaks eloquently about the story and the predominant theme of revenge.<br /><br />\\"Sweeney's London\\" provides historical background to 18th and 19th century London including the social and economical conditions with historians talking about how harsh life was back then. This is fascinating stuff and excellent insight the world that acts as a backdrop to the story.<br /><br />\\"The Making of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" takes a look at how the film came together.

B00168ML4I|5.0|Tim Burton: Hollywood's undisputed champion of gothic horror.<br />Sweeney Todd: a psycho barber and famous purveyor of dodgy pies.<br />Hmmmm... what took you so long?<br /><br />It was screamingly obvious what a gorgeous team they would make. Rarely have we seen a film director so perfectly matched to a musical. And the black magic begins when Johnny Depp's white-faced Sweeney steals up the Thames at the dead of night. As the boat slips under a spooky London Bridge it becomes quite clear that Burton was put on earth to shoot this glorious melodrama.<br /><br />The film unfolds like the Grimmest of fairy tales. Depp's bitter Sweeney returns to London after 15 years of hurt. His painful story emerges in hollow songs with haunting off-key melodies. He wears his grievances like armour. His plan to murder the men who condemned him to a penal colony in order to rape his wife hinges around the dismal apartment above Mrs Lovett's ailing pie shop. The atmosphere is vintage Hammer Studios. The gleaming monochrome shots of cobbled streets are drained of color. Effectively overwrought and excellent, Sweeney Todd is a movie of bombastic, impossible camera moves and rhapsodic yuckiness. Burton can't resist filling the screen with scuttling vermin or surges of splatterific violence.<br /><br />Depp's Sweeney is a fiery-eyed, razor-brandishing cadaver with a mad Pagliacci glare. Bonham Carter is comparably corpse-like--a matched composition in bird-nest hairdo, death-pallor complexion, and heavily shadowed eyes. The musical chemistry between Depp and Helena Bonham Carter's genial cockney pie shop mistress is terrific. Sondheim approved the casting, and, surprisingly, Depp has a pleasing, if untrained, tenor. Alongside Bonham Carter's sweetly tentative voice, the numbers are inventively staged. Especially the cannibal waltz \\"A Little Priest\\" and the grotesquely wistful \\"By the Sea\\". Lovett's unreciprocated passion for Sweeney is the heart of the film and her bright idea of stuffing Sweeney's clients into meat pies seems almost perfectly sensible under the circumstances.<br /><br />The film's pace is a surprise. Burton has pruned Sondheim's arias to fit the tempo of a real thriller -- brilliant editing - and the villains are far less stocky. Yes, the ghoulishly attractive couple is supported by a suitable gang of gargoyles; Sacha Baron Cohen delivers a priceless cameo as a jealous unisex rival with plans to blackmail Sweeney. Alan Rickman is a sinister pleasure as Judge Turpin. And Timothy Spall is equally effective as his ultra-violent slithery enforcer, Beadle Bamford.<br /><br />Burton has never been one to spare the gore. The sound of skulls cracking open when Sweeney tosses his victims head first into the basement is not for the faint-of-heart. The director's knack of finding comedy in these ghastly scenes is tested to the limit. And the haunting final shot of the film, the details of which we must keep to ourselves so not to spoil the plot, is a masterful shot, painterly in its composition of framing, detail, and color.<br /><br />There is so much that can be said about Sweeney Todd, but we must insist that you stop reading and simply experience this wonderous film for yourself. A mad serial killer, a helpful, adoring woman, a vile judge, and a barber's chair - all elements that combine to form much more than this simple review can encapsulate. It is masterful cinema, art and entertainment, vision and sound combined for a truly riveting experience.at pies seems almost perfectly sensible under the circumstances.

B000VECAC6|5.0|Monty Python's Life of Brian is one of the funniest films of all time.  It arose much fear, anger and suspicion in the religious world when the film was released in the late 70s, but the film is in no way blasphemous towards God, Jesus, or the Bible.  Now that this film is available in full 1080p HD you simply cannot miss watching it again or for the first time! Enjoy!
0143113100|1.0|If you think that you're getting another \\"Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain\\" type book, think again:  you will NOT.  Some portions of the book were rather hopeful, but there are portions of this book that should be RATED X.  There is some rather graphic, down-right vulgar information contained in this book.  Instead of showing the good of people, these portions displayed the dark side of humanity, the depravity of how far into \\"evil\\" someone could go.  I do not recommend this book if you are a highly visual person.  You've heard the saying \\"hate well;\\" in fact, I do hate this book rather well. The book is going back to the library rather quickly.

1400082773|5.0|As a Republican, I do not support Obama's principles, but, I have to admit - after reading this book - that he is a fascinating person. There were hardships in his life, but he shows no self-pity, he is an optimist and an achiever. it's no wonder he accomplished what most Americans only dream of: candidate for presidency (maybe even president!) This is a man of substance.<br />WARNING: this comment may upset Democrats [I just hope one day he will realize that the only way for prosperity; the only way to solve the nation's economic problems is pure capitalism, and the Republican way.]

0761145613|2.0|I bought the 2008 calendar based on other reviews and I was disappointed. We have 2 young kids, but even with their activities (and mom's & dad's), the vertical column set-up leaves really small squares to write a few basic words. The stickers are cute but there's no room to put them because the squares are so small - and there weren't that many \\"sports\\" stickers suprisingly. Plus, I don't know if you're supposed to use a special pen with the glossy paper, but if you use a regular ballpoint, the impressions bleed onto the next page. The monthly pictures are cute because we really like the Boynton books, but other than that, I'm sorry to say that I'm going to look for a different calendar.

I am extremely happy with my purchase and the process it took to get it.  Thank you Amazon!
0452289963|3.0|I have gotten about half way thru the book.  It is interesting read  but, some of it is a bit strange.  It really wasn't what I thought it would be.  I had planned to follow Oprah and Eckhart on line but, got frustrated with the web cutting out.  As fate would have it my computer crashed when I was going to look at another webcast.    I guess I am not really into this ego examination process at this time.

B000EDWKXI|4.0|This is a fun story about Casanova and his pursuit of the one women that he can't have.  She is intellectual, and thinks that he is a complete womanizer.  Casanova is just passing the time waiting for his mother to return after a promise when he was quite young.  He has been burning bridges everywhere he goes and the Cathlic church is knocking on the door for all of his transgressions.  With time running out, he pulls out all of the stops to win the heart of his love.
B000P7V45S|3.0|Listen to the over the top saturation and additional reverb and treble added to these Rhino mixes before you decide to unload your old Atco or 1994 Definitive remastered versions of Genesis albums in order to be replaced by these Rhino reissues.     Rhino apparently felt they needed to fix something that was not broken. They 'fixed' it alright. They fixed it so that it is overly loud and almost unlistenable to any long time Genesis fan who is familiar with how these albums should actually sound.    The saving grace is the bonus DVD with the surround mix of the album, the videos from the album and the awesome Genesis Live 1976 concert footage.    Buy it for the DVD, but not if you're just looking for a better remaster of the original album. Because the 94 reissues still sound best.
B0009RJUVE|5.0|I picked this up @ a table booksale @ the library & could not tear myself away.  I admit, I thought it was a little lengthy, but what an emotional, \\"love-tragedy!\\" The suffocation that both of the characters felt at trying to live up to their parents' expectation. But then trying to live up to the expectations of each other under the pressures of being an \\"arranged couple\\" since their birth is another thing. After I finished reading, I thought 'these kids never got a chance to explore their lives without one another.' Throw in sexual abuse & pregnancy & you have quite a messy situation. A situation that grew until it exploded.  Jodi Picoult is such an intense writer!
B000127LW2|5.0|After reading the reviews, I made sure not to get the bootlegged version, and was really happy with what I received. I don't think it should be as much as some of the other seasons since it's got fewer disks, but at least the quality was excellent. I'm not knocking any stars for that.
B000NDIAWO|4.0|Definitely an \\"Upgrade\\" and necessary revision of her previous load of scraps album B'day the original! I didn't purchase the original B'Day because I knew I would be ripped off paying 10+ dollars for a ~9 track album that Beyonce finished in two weeks! However, this revised copy was not too bad, and should've been the original B'day.    The album is overall VERY consistent, but at the same time it doesn't really have any groundbreaking masterpiece song that boasts the quality of Beyonce's previous \\"Crazy In Love\\", \\"Speechless\\", Be With You\\", \\"Me Myself and I\\" masterpiece tunes featured in \\"Dangerously In Love\\". The only ones that come to mind is \\"Listen\\", \\"Irreplaceable\\", and \\"Amor Gitano\\". \\"Listen\\" basically exposes Beyonce's voice for what it is, moderately powerful when it needs to be, and a good depiction of her necessary emotion and shades of soul and impressive range(she belts out an Eb5 in FULL VOICE!). Her voice truly does shine on this piece, and definitely solidifies her as one of the top five singing divas of today's modern age. The lyrics are also virtually immaculate, which always helps tons in a ballad! It is overall, one of Beyonce's better songs in her inventory, and quite possibly, her best ballad. \\"Irreplaceable\\" was milked to death over the radio, but it was a huge hit for Beyonce, and for good reason. A very catchy pop tune where Beyonce's voice soars with its attitude and supporting guitar sounds in the back. \\"Amor Gitano\\" is a fierce duet between Alejandro Fernandez and Beyonce. An upbeat, infectious Spanish tune. The rest of the album is tolerable, very consistent, and filled with mostly third and fourth single potential songs that are spread evenly throughout track list. However, some of the songs don't have the necessary hook or production that are necessary to catch the listener's ear upon first hearing. The beats are loud, chaotic, and work well for clubs, but in a more reserved audio or speaker system, the some of the songs' weaknesses and lack of melodic production might appear stale at times. It would also be nice if Beyonce could showcase that melodic voice of hers from time to time! The only song in here that showcases her impressive vocals and range is pretty much, \\"Listen\\" and \\"Resentment\\".    One thing about this is the overall new sound Beyonce took. Not an innovative sound by any means, and pretty much absent of the robotic, futuristic sounds of Justin Timberlake's Futuresex/Lovesounds, but it's a far cry from Beyonce's previous \\"Dangerously In Love\\". While \\"Dangerously In Love\\" focused more on R&B, slow sultry sounds, this album's focus was more on chaotic, dance tunes, without the electronica tint. So fans who are expecting R&B sounds or electronically dance infused pop music should be warned right now. 4/5 stars.
B000VLE3GA|4.0|Actually, Robert's voice sounds pretty good, too... So maybe I should rephrase it like this: I never had to hear so much of Jimmy Page's guitar! Since I am not a big fan of his playing and believe everything that I like in LZ music was coming from Robert Plant, you'll understand I was not particularly thrilled, and up until the last moment was going to give this release 3 stars. But then... - hey, these are some great songs, an excellent collection!     Which brings me to address the younger audience, those curious about LZ and considering Mothership as a way to sample the music: *buy it*! Don't listen to the reviews here critisizing the sound. Because you haven't heard the old versions, they won't be in your head to spoil the impression. And the music is great. It is unique and has influenced many, many of the later bands and artists.       Now to the old-timers, my age (I'm 39) and older, those wondering whether this new remaster indeed sounds as horrible as some describe: well, it is not disastrous, but it does sound kinda loud. I honestly thought this wouldn't be an issue with me, and perhaps I wouldn't even notice, but I did notice. There is an excellent earlier review here, describing how the reviewer compared this remaster to the older one by bringing the loudness of Robert's vocal to the same, comfortably loud, level. As a result, everything else on the new remaster got overpowering, in-your-ear loud. I confirm that, and I wholeheartedly join those who disapprove. On the other hand, isn't that what the band themselves wanted?.. Isn't this *their* own remaster?.. And I do have two good guesses why they would have wanted it this way:   (1) Our 60-year old gods want to be liked by the younger audience. Nothing wrong wih that, who are we to judge.  (2) Wasn't LZ always a loud band? I was born in '68, but those older will perhaps remember, what were the early audiences impressions of their playing? - Loud! I really believe they would've likely be recording just like this in their days, had it been technically possible. Annoyingly loud.     My favorite LZ song, if I had to pick just one, has been Since I've Been Loving You. Listening to the Mothership version, I do hear quite a bit more detail. It does not, however, breathe with nearly as much emotion as the much rougher Since I've Been Loving You on my old LZ III vinyl LP.    ADDED 4/6/08: this album really *is* louder than others! I recently bought wonderful AKG K701 headphones [[ASIN:B000FOU51A AKG K701 Open-Back Studio Headphones with Flat-Wire Voice Coil]] , and these require long burn-in for their sound to fully develop. So I made a long playlist, set it on repeat, and have been playing it through the headphones the last several days. Because K701s are open design, you can hear the music very well across the room. Whenever Mothership's turn comes, it is *significantly\\" louder than the rest, including Metallica, recent live Black Sabbath album (just to give you an idea the rest is not all Mark Knopfler). Nothing subtle in this album, unlike so many of the Robert's tracks I love.

B00011KHTM|5.0|I use my macbook 90% of the time as a desktop replacement system with the DVI to mini-dvi adapter. However, I would recommend purchasing both the mini-dvi and the vga adapters.<br /><br />First, the next lcd you buy your probably going to be using DVI, so you will have it on hand. Second, if you already use DVI, its nice to have the VGA adapter in your laptop case. Why? When you go into the field you can easily connect up your macbook to a clients monitor or better yet, to an overhead projection system...in addition, if your DVI lcd ever goes out you can pull out an old CRT or LCD and hook up the VGA adapter and not lose any downtime.<br /><br />Again, purchase both the DVI to mini-dvi and the DVI to VGA at the same time, here on amazon, and you will save some money.<br /><br />Lastly, don't purchase this on amazon from Circuit City! I did and they sent me the DVI to S-VIDEO adapter instead.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I was introduced to this movie 20+ years ago in a college film class.  I watch it every Christmas season 2-3 times, and even though I know almost every line and everything that is going to happen, it never fails to bring me to tears of joy.  This is truely the greatest movie ever made.  Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reid are outstanding.  You cannot go wrong with this purchase.
B00132D808|5.0|When I first heard the sound of Panic at  the Disco, I fell in love with their music. Their first album is quite lively, very punk-like and pumps you up without the help of any illegal substance. Pretty Odd, however is very different from PATD's first CD. If you're looking for more of the same or a Part II of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, then you'll end up disappointed. However, if you are a true music enthusiast and take this second album for what it is, \\"Pretty Odd\\" is more musically enthralling and ambitious too. Panic has been able to keep their carnivalesque image, but with a more subtle outreach. Actually if you listen to it closely, Pretty Odd seems to be divided in two. The first 6 songs seem to introduce the other half of the CD, which begins with \\"Northern Downpour\\" featuring Brendon Urie's melodic sweet voice.   I hope this review helps!
B000MR9D5E|1.0|I never received the product. Sent an email to the seller but they never answered me, I'm very dissapointed. Already contacted Amazon for a reimbursement.
B000EK76K8|5.0|This adapter is a must have for any macbook owner. I use my macbook as a desktop system with a 20\\" lcd, wireless keyboard & mouse etc, around 90% of the time...the other 10% I just grab the macbook and go in the field to use it during consultations.    It would be wise to also purchase the DVI to VGA adapter as well if your a road warrior. Having it in your laptop case is really great when you need to connect to a large display on-site, or even better when you need to plug into a projection system. Another reason is if your lcd goes out, you can always plug into a vga only monitor or LCD and not lose downtime.    In conclusion, again, I would buy both the DVI to mini DVI and the DVI to VGA connectors. Both are manufactured by the same company and very durable, nicely designed products.

B0010V4TZU|4.0|\\"Vampire Weekend\\" is one of those rare debut CDs that will make even the most jaded ear sit up and take notice. I had heard so much about this young band before downloading their debut album, with people calling it \\"the first important disc of 2008\\". Naturally my curiosity peaked, and perhaps for the first time in a while, I downloaded an entire album without having heard even a single track beforehand.<br /><br />What a revelation! Each song here is unique, and a winner. Many critics have trouble defining the actual sound of the music here, and so many definitions I've read are vague pastiches that don't make any real sense to a novice. At their best, this group sounds like an obscure folk-rock German group trying to go pop. At their worst, they sound like a regular all-American indie band that gets high on a Saturday night and sit around jamming out half-hearted tunes.<br /><br />Either way, the hype is valid. And thats because of the variety here. This is quite an intelligent record because it dispenses altogether with the need for cohesiveness or length (its barely more than 30 minutes altogether) and instead go for variety. Baroque influences, reggae-tinged rhythms, coupled with orchestral passages ripped from some obscure Dvorak recording go hand in hand with a modern 'Fall Out Boy' sounding ambience, that really I don't think has been done before. I think that this band is going to have trouble on their second album though, because this 'freshness' can't always be replicated.<br /><br />The much talked-about song \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" is a winner, primarily because it starts with a Hawaiian influenced guitar pick that is SO infectious (its currently my phone's ringtone). Most of these songs are short little anthems that burst out and get over just as fast as they begun. Very Weezer-sounding in places, as well.<br /><br />If you haven't heard anything by Vampire Weekend, then just get this album blindly. Its one of those rare instances where an album can please all demographics - its reach far outdoes its' inherent musical worth - and despite that minor quibble, this is fantastic music for a morning while getting ready for work, or a trip in your car.ch far outdoes its' inherent musical worth - and despite that minor quibble, this is fantastic music for a morning while getting ready for work, or a trip in your car.
0810994739|5.0|I bought this book for my son who has always struggled with reading.  He read the first book in the series and raved about it.  When I discovered there was a second book published, I immediately bought it.  My son was delighted and started reading it straight away.  It took him a couple of weeks to read.  He loved it and can't wait for the third book in the series to be published. Well done to Jeff Kinney, please keep writing as you have found the ideal book for boys who struggle with reading.

0689105657|5.0|I bought this book for my boyfriend because I destroyed his copy.  I carried this book around with me EVERYWHERE for 2 months.  It starts out a little slow, but James Clavell provides amazing insights into ancient Japanese culture. If you're interested in Japan, this is a very fun book.     It has a very sad ending though.  I actually went into a 3 day period of mourning when my favorite character died.    It is a very long book (1152 pages) but it will keep you entertained for months.  But overall, I highly recommend this book.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|Caligula was an interesting film no dought.  So interesting that there was one thing I had to question about it.  If Caligula was that nuts, then bravo to Malcom McDowell!      WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS     It all starts out with Caligula (Played brillainty and not so brillainty by Malcom McDowell) lying under a tree with his lover, who actually happens to be his sister Drusilla (Played by the hot unknown Teresa Ann Savory).  And a note to those who are offended by this, insest wasn't uncommon back then, the Egyptians did it too.  But they didn't know back then that when a brother got a sister pregnant that the baby would be deformed.  But back to the movie.  Drusilla is married to a fat guy, and Caligula wants her all for himself.  But the real trouble isn't the insest going on, it's the fact that the really perverted Tiberius (Played maginificanty by Peter O'Toole), Caligula's adoptive grandfather, is a tyrant.  Caligula goes through certain stages that Tiberius tries to kill him.      Then as the film goes on Tiberius is strangled by Macro.  Later Caligula is crowned emperor of Rome!  Later on he has Macro killed.  Then he must find a wife, since Drusilla is already taken.  He finds the most promiscuos woman in all of Rome, Caesonia (Played by the Oscar winning Helen Murrin).  After he marries Caesonia he gets her pregnant, it turns out to be a girl rather then a boy, and not suprisingly he names her after the true love of his life, Drusilla!      Now for the bad part, Caligula rapes a girl who he wanted to marry originally, talk about humiliation, and he puts his fist up her new husband's butt!  How is that possible?!  Later on he kills her husband and a bunch of sex slaves have sex with his dead body.  Then later on Drusilla dies, and Caligula is crushed, no he didn't have sex with her dead body, he was kissing it, but that's it, they pretty much editied the infamous sex scene when Caligula has sex with his dead sister's body. Then things go from bad to worst.He starts pimping the senitor's wives, and everyone as we can tell isn't happy about Caligula.  And for those prono lovers and haters, yes people were really that sluty back then, after all Rome was a promicuous sociaty.      Then at the end of the movie, they kill Caligula and his wife and infant daughter.  And to think that his daughter had to suffer for the sins of her father, what a shame!      Well other then that there were some goofs with the movie.      A. Some historical goofs, Caligula married his wife Caesonia only after Drusilla died in real life.  Macro is rumored to have committed suicide, not been beheaded which leaves me to goof number B.    B. When they beheaded Macro it wasn't your average ancient execution, no it was some kind of beheading machine which didn't exist at all back then!  So that part was kind of stupid.     C.  When they smashed Caligula's daughter's head into the cement at the end, it appeared to me that her head was already smashed before it hit the ground, then again it could just be me.      So while there is some truth to the film, it's all just Hollywood to me.  On a positive note, excillent cast, costums, scenery and sex!  The acting was ok, but not very great, Malcom McDowell should have gotten an acadamy award, however it seemed like he tried too hard to act like a villian.  He was good at acting like a nut, but nobody sounds like a villian in real life.  But if I had to chose watching this and watching Waterworld, it would defently be this film!  It's the best flop ever!

B000VNMMR0|4.0|The original Diehard was a groundbreaking movie. It featured an breakout performance by Bruce Willis, it had great action, a fun plot, and a romantic twist. Diehard had two unique characteristics that I believe made the first two films so successful, and hindered the third in the series. First, there was a problem only John McClain could solve. In the skyscraper, and then in the airport, the police, FBI and military were on the scene, but for whatever reason, only John McClain could be the hero. If it wasn't for McClain, the bad guys would win. Second, McClain was motivated by love. In the first film, his wife was being held hostage, in the second, she was in a jet that was about to run out of fuel. McClain acted not only to save others, but to save his wife. The third Die Hard abandoned both of those plot points and wasn't as good because of it.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard is out some 13 years after the third movie. Willis still looks great. The action is great. The dialogue (in the unrated version) is what you'd expect. The movie opens with McClain being asked to escort a computer hacker to the FBI for questioning. McClain shows up and must immediately fight off heavily armed thugs. From there on, its action scene after action scene as McClain and the hacker (played by Justin Long) must avoid the bad guys. The bad guys, led by Timothy Oliphant have shut down the entire East Coast. They've disrupted traffic lights, trains, Wall Street, and power grids. No one knows what is going on. Except perhaps John McCain, who is sitll escorting the hacker that just might have a clue as to what is going on, and how to stop it. This movie succeeds because McClain is once again forced to be the hero.<br /><br />While the FBI and Homeland Security have to deal with the larger problems of the entire computer systems of the country being disrupted, McClain has the advantage of being with a guy that might just know what was going on. McClain charges on, never one to stop and wait for help. The movie sets up action scenes after action scenes, and after awhile they become repetitive. Even so, they do actually get better and better. McClain's daughter Lucy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, substitutes for the wife as the damsel in distress McClain must save. Having to save his daughter adds just enough of emotion and depth to counter all of the non-stop testosterone.<br /><br />This movie won't go down as one of the best ever. How can it when it is the fourth in the series? But it features one of the best action heroes of the last twenty years showing that he is still on top of his games. Justin Long is solid as the wise cracking computer hacker that is with Willis for the ENTIRE movie. Oliphant is menancing as a bad guy even if his motivation isn't clear until the end. The rest of the cast doesn't make an impression. Fans of Die Hard and Willis should enjoy this movie. It is fun, fast-paced and violent.movie sets up action scenes after action scenes, and after awhile they become repetitive. Even so, they do actually get better and better.

B0013F2LPS|5.0|Here's a minor prediction for the musical year -- the Foals just might be the Next Really Big Thing in indie-rock.<br /><br />Yeah, someone says that about a fledgling band every year, sometimes more than once. But this little Oxford band has what it takes, and \\"Antidotes\\" is a gloriously energetic debut album -- mellow, bright rock'n'roll that makes you dance and bounce, yet has some postrock spaciness, nimble electronics and clever funky twists to keep things interesting. And it actually gets better as it goes on.<br /><br />It opens on a relatively simple note -- \\"The French Open,\\" an jazzy-funky little pop intro that periodically erupts into solid dancy rock. \\"Un peu d'air sur la terre/D'air sur la/D'air sur la/D'air sur la terre!\\"<br /><br />With that as the intro, they leap wholeheartedly into the cocky, rollicking \\"Cassius,\\" with its muscular riffs and confusingly jabby lyrics (\\"Cassius, it's over! You're second best!\\"). And with \\"Red Sock Pugie,\\" we get another catchy indie-rock melody -- but wrapped in a shimmering post-rock blanket, riddled with kettle drums.<br /><br />And most of the songs that follow linger somewhere between those two styles -- ringing circling pop with convulsing violins, moody rock tunes, fast funky dance music, fast-moving spacey tunes with airy fantastical lyrics, and a shimmering pop anthem in \\"Big Big Love (Fig. 2).\\"<br /><br />The Foals seem to wind down the album with the catchy \\"Like Swimming,\\" a little instrumental that sounds like eavesdropping on a tropical pool party. Then they yank you back up for the final song \\"Tron,\\" a dark little rocker with tight, muscular instrumentation and chirruping guitars.<br /><br />The Foals don't seem satisfied just by making music that makes you dance -- they seem to be striving for something cool yet fun, clever yet not pretentious. And they apparently want a mishmash style -- if you listen carefully, the indie-rock sound is infused with elements of funk, dance, and shimmering hazy spaciness. All this, and it's fun too.<br /><br />Part of what makes their music so appealing is the versatility -- we've got powerful bouncy riffs, undercurrents of grainy bass, and solid, hollow-sounding drums keeping the music energetic. But they can also make those instruments do some very odd things -- their guitars alone are a sonic circus, chirping or creaking or spiraling around in glittering loops.<br /><br />And then you get the really out-there stuff -- blares of Afrobeat brass, the occasional kettle drums, shimmers of keyboard, and some pedal guita to, as it's been reported around the Web, \\"mimic the sound of the solar system.\\" I don't really know what a solar system sounds like, but I presume that's the gloriously spacey, shimmery sound that wafts through most of these songs.<br /><br />Yannis Philippakis always sounds like he's about to run out of breath, but his flexible voice has enough energy to keep up with the music. And for a beginner band, the Foals have a knack for lyrics, filled with \\"butcher birds,\\" falling towers, nameless fuels, exploding hearts, and eating clouds to pass the time when you're not fighting vampires. Isn't that great?<br /><br />The Foals at first sound like just another art-rock band, but these guys have a special knack for effortlessly mixing elaborate cross-genre indie-rock with energetic dance. Keep an eye on these lads.makes their music so appealing is the versatility -- we've got powerful bouncy riffs, undercurrents of grainy bass, and solid, hollow-sounding drums keeping the music energetic.

B0009RJUVE|4.0|Picoult offers up another dramatic plot thick with moral dilemmas and grave consequences.  Chris and Emily have known each other since birth, and now they are teenagers in love, much to the delight of their parents.  Then one night, Emily is killed by a gunshot wound to the head and Chris is left alive after what he claims was a suicide pact gone wrong.  There is much more to the details than meets the eye, however.  This delves into the criminal and legal investigations more so than any of Picoult's other books that I have read (so far).  One huge difference was Chris's experience in prison while awaiting his trial.  It was a grim portrayal that I felt was delivered skillfully.  The story in general was very good, but a few of the characters could have been developed more.  I think the only problems lie with the parents of both Emily and Chris.  In the beginning of the book, we are thrust into their world and at first it is hard to discern Melanie from Gus and Michael from James and who Chris and Emily belonged to, they were so interchangeable.  It progressed better about a third of the way into the plot, but I felt there were more avenues and dimensions Picoult could have explored through the grief-ravaged parents.  In all, though, a thoroughly enjoyable book with a few twists and turns that will keep any Picoult fan engaged.
0811729117|5.0|This is a great book since first page.    The narrative is precise and exciting, you can feel yourself inside the tiger tank with guns blazing across the eastern front.     Mr.Otto Carius is very inteligent and has a great point of view about the war to share with the readers.    It is definitely a must have book.

B0007GBBVO|3.0|wonderfully cheesy movie. i was looking for something special for movie night (since it can get a bit repetative around here) and this caught my eye. haven't seen it in years, thought it would be fun to see it again.<br /><br />i placed my order (thru amazon seller tinnman) 3.27.08 & recv'd it earlier today, so shipping time was great. seller gets only 3 stars because i was misled by the seller's note. says comes with 3 pairs of 3D glasses, but they were the cheap (red & blue anaglyph) ones. disc requires the 3D shutter glasses for viewing. VERY DISAPPOINTING. seller's note really should have specified this.<br /><br />my purchase came with 3 pairs of 3D glasses alright. they were the anaglyph style ones (you know, red & blue lenses), and worse... they were pulled off of someone's copy of Spy Kids 3. whoever purchases that disc will be unhappy since now i've got the glasses that were supposed to belong to their movie (and i have no use for them).<br /><br />the movie itself is great (if you like terrible cheesy movies - and i do). don't know about this copy since the proper glasses aren't included.<br /><br />oh well. next time i'll just buy it new from somewhere else. lesson learned, i guess.
B000ZN802W|3.0|What ev er. Yeah, let's take a 10 pound bag of rice and a .22 into the Alaskan wilderness and see how long we can survive. Seek out the Men's Journal article if you want to read the truth about Chris. But do it after you see Into the Wild. It'll really blow the entire integrity of the movie for you.  That being said, if your prepared to view this movie as strictly fiction, a story, then it's an awesome film. The performances are award worthy, especially Holbrook and Keener. Watching this film, I felt that Hollywood magic thing happen, where you feel possibilities open up in your own life. The only other bad thing was that at the end of the film, Alex Supertramp looked an awful lot like one of the Geico Cavemen, which made it a little difficult to fully embrace what was happening to the character. Oh yeah, and all Vedders music sounded the same to me. Cat Stevens he aint.
B000YKE87W|4.0|Jonas Kauffman may not be the most familiar name in opera, since he's relatively new on the international scene. While I vaguely remembered hearing his name mentioned a few times, no doubt form listening to radio broadcasts from New York's Metropolitan Opera, it was only after reading a  review of this CD in OPERA NEWS that my interest was piqued in his artistry.  The reviewer could not speak highly enough of him. He was being hailed as in the tradition of the greats, so I decided to see if the collection was worthy of such praise. I certainly enjoyed the collection and it is my guess is that he's at the beginning of a wonderful career.<br /><br />In this collection, Kaufmann tackles some of operas best known tenor arias. This in itself is a challenge. Since listeners are so familiar with Pavarotti, Domingo, Corelli, and di Stefano performing, and in some case all but owning many of the arias in this set, comparisons would be natural. While he is not yet in the same category as some of the legendary tenors, he could well be on his way. He has a full voice with wonderful expression. Most of the arias are the standard 19th century arias. and he is adept in the Italian, French, and German repertoire. His strongest arias are those from LA BOHEME, CARMEN, MEISTERSINGER, DER FREISCHUTZ, and MARTHA.  Overall the French repertoire may not be his strongest suit since the two weakest arias are from FAUST and WERTHER where he tends to strain a bit in both..<br /><br />My guess is that this is just the first Kauffman recording. His voice is appealing, it has the full sound we associate with tenors such as Pavarotti et al, and he's at home in a wide variety of roles. This is a worthwhile collection to own, but I think it's safe to predict that as good as this collection is, the best may be yet to come.
B000VBP38C|4.0|This production felt rushed through many scenes.  It definetely doesn't bother with the finer points of Jane Austen's story.  I would have preferred a little bit more characture and story development but what the film makers decided to include is so well done all is forgiven.  A very beautiful version of a classic story.
B00012FXAE|3.0|When I was a kid, it just blew my mind to see this movie. However, as an adult, it really fell short of what I needed to be fully entertained. It is an \\"ok\\" movie at best.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Hands down this is the best adaptation of Jane Austin's Masterpiece \\"Persuasion\\". All the actors and the sets costumes ect...The new Persuasion is excellent too, but if you want a version faithful to the book you need to buy this one. It is absolutley breathtaking. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds were born for the roles. They have wonderful chemestry. Your heart beats with Ann's when she sees Captain Wentworth for the 1st time in 7 years you can hardly breath! You can feel his pain when he expresses himself at the dinner at her home over his disappointment 7 years eariler. The conversation is public but it's really a private message from him to her. I cannot reccomend this movie enough. If you have read the book you must see this movie. It is the book!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Like many others, I am seeing the series as they come out on HBO, and have yet to read the book (which I intend to at some point). The series features great acting, poignant scenes, and memorable oratory. But what really got me was how it transported you to that time, when life was a series of great heroics, but was also harsh, gritty, and so unforgiving. The series kept sending me to try and research different historial events that I remembered fleetingly reading about, in one line or a few paragraphs during unfortunately uninspiring history classes of many years ago. The concept of being \\"tarred and feathered\\" took a whole new dimension for me, as the brutality of that era touched everyone, rightly or wrongly. I am sure I would have more to say once I have finished seeing the series, but I cannot stop thinking about the different scenes. I recommend it to everyone very highly, and can't wait for the DVD to come out.
B00005MAM2|5.0|One of the best Japanese animation projects ever made, Akira is a true classic. The story does tend to get just a little silly at the end, but the movie as a whole is extremely entertaining, and the quality of the animation still holds a standard over today's sci-fi movies.    A note on the \\"New\\" English Dialog: It actually makes the story easier to understand. For those of you who were hoping to find the \\"Original English\\" dub, its not provided on the Special Edition, contrary to some false info I have read on forums claiming it is. I missed the old voices, especially from the first time I saw this movie in a theater in NYC. None the less, the nostalgia holds faithful. Akira is fantastic.
0618918248|3.0|There has been a great deal of noise over this book. To my mind, it mostly amounts to the proverbial tempest in a teapot.<br /><br />First, despite the right of religious liberty people in advanced countries supposedly enjoy, we are regularly immersed, willy-nilly, in religious muck. The last couple of decades in America, the nightly news has featured everything from endless demands for prayer in public institutions and the creation myth being taught in schools to attacks on doctors doing legal abortions and silly fights over displaying the ten commandments in public courts. What's so terrible about the other side getting a little publicity for a change?<br /><br />Richard Dawkins is a pleasant and clear writer. The first part of his book is genuinely funny, hilarious in places, as he pokes fun at the absurd stories and rules of the Bible. At his best, he reminds me of Mark Twain in Letters from the Earth.<br /><br />I think he is much less successful in the middle part of the book in trying to establish a logical framework for thinking about religion. Religion simply is not logical, none of it, ever, and just as the scholastic fathers tried over and over to \\"prove\\" the existence of God - Dawkins entertainingly goes through some of this - this effort seems futile.<br /><br />There is an aspect of religion that I believe Dawkins misses. It is the cultural dimension of much of religion. We know many Jews, as in Israel for example, are quite worldly and not believers, yet something binds them to the heritage of their religion. That something is what Dawkins misses.<br /><br />Religion works very much like prejudice: there are simply attitudes and perspectives that groups of people share together as a cultural inheritance, and the attitudes are generally detrimental to, and disparaging of, others.<br /><br />I share the belief that religion has been responsible for many of humanity's miseries. The record of Christianity has likely been the bloodiest of any religion, despite all the blubbering today about Islam. Christianity has been at the root of crusades, inquisitions, religious wars, mass murders, civil wars, torture, destruction of aboriginal people, slavery, and countless other horrors and abuses.<br /><br />But I do not believe for an instant that religion and its abuses will stop any time soon, and I certainly do not believe that any words I can say will change the views of the religiously-minded. But Dawkins does appear to believe this, which I think is a little naïve for a man of such exceptional talent.<br /><br />I believe it quite likely that we inherit our tendency for religion, just as we likely do for our politics. If that is true, we will only see the superstition and prejudice of religion disappear as humans evolve.<br /><br />Most people who do not take their religion too seriously will enjoy at least a good portion of this provocative book, but the seriously religious would best avoid it.ristianity has been at the root of crusades, inquisitions, religious wars, mass murders, civil wars, torture, destruction of aboriginal people, slavery, and countless other horrors and abuses.

006135323X|5.0|In this delightful exercise into the human mind, Professor Ariely seeks to answer the question which has bedevilled philosophers and social scientists forever: why do we act irrationally?    Using experiments, frequently utilizing MIT and Harvard students as guinea pigs, Professor Ariely shows the human mind at work. The process of coming up with a hypothesis, testing it, and then the followup experienments reads like a fun mini novel each time: complete with climax, and a few after thoughts.    Experiments showing how merely thinking of the Ten Commandments increases honesty, or mulling the word \\"elderly\\" slows one down are fascinating, both as cocktail party conversation starters, as as self-help nuggets.    Highly recommended.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|As I sat and watched this I found myself continually asking, how in the world did they get that shot?  The amount of work that went into producing this series is phenomenal, and it certainly shows in each and every breathtaking episode.  On a 1080p TV you will find yourself wondering if what you're viewing is animated or real, and if it's taking place right outside your house!  I felt like I was standing in an aquarium looking at live fish during the freshwater episode.  If you love our planet earth, then don't pass up this opportunity to see the beauty of our earth in ways you could never imagine!  5 Stars!
B0010X73ZG|4.0|With the exception of Carrie (Sissie Spacek version) and Misery, most adaptations of Stephen King stories have been disappointing. The Mist however, must be added to the short list of good ones. It is scary, suspenseful, and unpredictable. While the film features some great monsters, one could easily replace them with a terrorist attack or nuclear disaster. The film is really about how thin the veneer of civilization is when humans are faced with catastrophe. I particularly liked Marcia Gay Harden's character, the town \\"crackpot\\" who becomes a charismatic (and allegedly psychic) religious leader when things begin to go very badly. Some reviewers complained about the ending. While grim, I thought it was perfect, suggesting one should fight to the end and never give up hope prematurely.
0374530718|5.0|Take the plunge.  This really is a great introduction to philosophy--If that is what you want to read this book for, then as of yet I have not found a better book.  The plot can be gimmicky, but you won't care if you'll realize it is just a little flavor to move the book along while tackling certain philosophical questions outside of history and instead inside the actual novel.  There are over 500 reviews written on this book. It currently has a four star review and the only real criticism I see is that people say that it is not 'real literature.'  Well I just find that elitist humbug of people  who are too proud to admit that this is a wonderful introduction to philosophy.
B0010X745K|5.0|\\"The Mist\\" was a great entertaining movie......keep you wondering what's going to happen next....the ending was a shocker
B00005JPUN|4.0|I wavered between 3 and 4 stars and decided on 4 because I will be recommending this film to friends and family.  It was never an Oscar contender or high art but in my Drive-in days, this would have been a winner. We've seen various iterations of Invasion of the Body Snatchers over the past 50 years so there's no suspense in the basic premise.  This version quickly hones in on a mother and son caught up in this horror and their battle to survive. Their battle to survive is very suspenseful.  The child actor does a nice job as the son and Nicole Kidman is convincingly fierce as his mother who will do anything to protect him.  I'm reminded of Ripley in Aliens, going up against the monster to save the little girl.  This film nicely captures the heebie-jeebie factor of being forced to blend in as humans suddenly becoming souless, emotionless killers, in a sense, as the aliens' quest is to take over Earth by killing the humanity inside of us.  I liked the ending. And I like that the movie is not gory.  Makes it easier to sleep.
B00000G3I2|5.0|Yes, there's a funeral, which is the basis for the background story for this film -- but the dead guy would have been fine with his associates' activities over this \\"going back\\" weekend.<br /><br />The story is essentially this: A gregarious assemblage of Baby Boomers (now mostly successful and semi-rich) come together for a weekend reunion when a friend, (drug-crazed, who never left the 60s), dies. The post-funeral activities range from philosophical meanderings to reefer smoking to carnal intercourse. The corpse's young girlfriend stays on throughout the weekend for additional comic relief.<br /><br />I could watch this one over and over, (and I do). They say that, \\"You can never go back,\\" but this film returns one to the 60s for just a little re-peek. Here are the great things about this movie, at least for Baby Boomers:<br /><br />1. The music. This film features one of the great 60s soundtracks of all time:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001JXQCE The Big Chill - Deluxe Edition]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000DLW8 The Big Chill: More Songs from the Original Soundtrack]]<br /><br />2. The story -- the interactions of these characters absolutely reminded me of the humorous hipocracy of my pals and myself as well.<br /><br />3. The cinematography of this film is second to none. The locations and sets are also superb.<br /><br />4. The casting in this film is so perfect I can't think of one change that I would have made.<br /><br />I don't know that this movie would mean a lot (or have any meaning whatever) for younger generations of people -- you sort of had to be there. It's a comedy film in a sense, (falling into a category of films which I would normally avoid), but this is a MUST SEE for any Baby Boomer who participated in the nefarious, free-love-society of the '60s.<br /><br />Highly recommended to appropriate viewers.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|i got this just because i felt like it, hoping i would like the other songs besides \\"stop and stare\\" and \\"apologize\\".    boy, i sure did. all the songs are really great. this cd even includes the orignal version of \\"apologize\\", which i like better than the remix (which is what is played on the radio).    get the cd, its really amazing! and instant love.
0525950079|5.0|Until this was published, I had no idea there would be a sequel to \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  I can now state conclusively that I have read two of the best epic novels recently published.  Both of these books rank right up there with Taylor Caldwell's best (i.e. Tale of Two Men, Captains and Kings, Great Lion of God, etc., etc.).  The 1300's historical setting could have been moved to the 21st century and the tale would have still been great, and relevant.  Even at a 1000 plus pages, I hated to see it end, but couldn't put it down.  Great book ... great read ... highly recommended!!!!
1400063515|3.0|I'll keep this short, as NNT certainly didn't with this book. The essence of this text is really quite neat and interesting: social dynamics + cognitive biases result in events which follow power law distributions.     While not a particularly long book, it isn't a quick read as you have to plod along with the authors ego sucking any levity from the text (despite his small jokes along the way.) If you are familiar with his previous book, or any work from behavioral economics you can certainly see where he is going from the get go. It just takes a while for him to get there.    If you are in a rush, I'd read all of the first part, the last chapter of the second part and then call it a day. There is nothing interesting of note from the 'technical' portion of part three that you couldn't have seen coming in chapter one.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|The guy who lent me this said he liked its look.  I found its look extremely distracting because it gave me eye strain.  But if we cut through that, we find that, in fact, this movie sucks.  Well, I admit that I only watched 2 of its 20 (I think) segments.  It's a loving tribute to 30s radio sci-fi serials and 50s sci-fi TV, but I see no reason to pay tribute to either of those formats, because they're full of bad writing, bad acting, and bad science.  As was this movie.  Life's too short.  Go watch THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  This particular movie is strictly for stupid people.
B000UJ48XG|5.0|So I was on YouTube one day and this band was featured as one of the \\"playing\\" videos on the homepage. I checked them out and fell in love! I had never shopped with Amazon before now - but I am going to do it again in the future. I was very pleased with the shipping time and the c.d. is great!
B00004YC2F|5.0|At first listening, I didn't like the interpretation at all - Volodos' excessive effort to bring all detail to attention impedes flow of music at times. But the more I listen the more I was amazed by his enormous capacity to articulate every detail, not only in right-hand, but also in left-hand part, and to dig deeper into heart of the music. The cadenza in the middle movement is incredibly vivid. I still prefer Horowitz' earlier accounts, but this one has something very special, more depth and dignity perhaps.    Volodos' own transcription of the slow movement from Rachmaninov's Cello Sonata, played with breath-taking delicacy, is just magical and apt encore piece after the incandescent finale of the concerto.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|THE POINT OF VIEW REVIEW: POPCORN TIME with \\"American Gangster\\"    American Gangster. Fantastic.     The team that made this film has successfully delivered a wonderfully engrossing true story of two very fascinating men.     This is the amazing story of a genius of a crime boss named Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washinton) and the cop who wouldn't let him go (played by Russell Crowe).    What is particularly impressive is that the American Gangster presents both the glamour and the grit of the life of crime, but somehow does it in such a way that neither side out weighs the other. It is simply one very complete story with excellent writing and great execution.    Is it violent? Yes, but not at all in a gratuitous manner. It's a gangster movie.    Is it long? Yes and no. Its two and a half hours long, but I only say that so you have the right amount of snacks to get you through. The film doesn't feel long, it's simply an interesting story that takes longer than average to tell.     This is a movie for those who love film, a good story, gangster movies, historically based dramas or just great entertainment.    Enjoy!    [...]

Love the way peace emanates from you. It's transformational, and I bow to you with utmost respect and say thanks which I cannot convey enough. I will start my second reading of the book, and I cannot wait. The time when I first picked up the book, I was in the \\"midst\\" of suffering over a loss. I started feeling \\"light\\" almost instantaneously as I absorbed your words. I am still grieving, but I know I have an amazing resource I can turn to anytime. I have been practicing all that you recommend and I see lots of hope for me.    Thank you Eckhart. For those who have not given this book a chance, I highly recommend you do. It's a gem. A great resource to keep for life, not just for the trying times, but for EVERYDAY living. Nothing would be \\"ordinary\\" anymore after you read the book.     Love and peace to all,  galintx.
B000002TQB|5.0|Quite honestly, playing this album makes you want to like... Walk through the streets of the UK toting your guitar case headed towards band practice while wearing your union jack bearing leather jacket in the chilly november air. It's inspiring. While listening to it, you're wishing you could make music like this. I love blur. I think it's always been a close tie between them and oasis, but blur always comes out on top because of Albarn's voice. Definitely one of the best albums of the 90s, definitely one of the best in my personal collection, and definitely one of blur's best. you get this, you won't regret it and you'll play it everyday for about 2 months.
0452289963|5.0|\\"A New Earth\\" is a wonderful extension of Eckhart Tolle's first book,\\"The Power of Now\\". It is so exciting that Eckhart and Oprah are teaming<br />up and sharing the content of this amazing book on their worldwide web event! I love how Eckhart writes \\"how the voice in the head has a life of its own.\\"There is a great freedom understanding that I am not my thoughts. I woke up this morning worrying about my busy schedule and if I would accomplish what needed to get done. Then I relaxed when I remembered Eckhart's words. I simply saw this thought process without judging it, realizing that this voice is not me. And I had a very productive day!<br /><br />If you find Eckhart's book enlightening, you'll love reading Ariel & Shya Kane's books, \\"[[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]]\\", and \\"[[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]]\\". As Eckhart beautifully describes living in the moment, the Kanes give the \\"how to\\" in their books. The Kanes also have an awesome radio show called \\"Being Here\\" via their website. I love that authors like Eckhart Tolle and Ariel and Shya Kane are providing internet access to their discoveries, accelerating and strengthening the life style of enlightenment for all of us!
B0013J559S|4.0|I thought going in that this would turn out to be just another in the long line of generic bank heist movies that came before it; it wasn't.  The heist is essentially completed by the halfway point and the rest of the movie deals with the machinations that lead to it and its repercussions.  The mix of intrigue, action and interesting characters left me very satisfied when it was time for the credits to roll.

Everything she said about this book made you want to read it and know there would be wonderful insightfull information to improve your way of life.

It is a great book.  I would advise everyone to read it.

0060530839|5.0|Mr. Lewis' whimsical style creates a fast paced, fast read fairy tale.  Woven throughout the book are Christian themes, however, I believe you can still thoroughly enjoy this book even if you are not a Christian.  I believe it can be enjoyed by all ages and would be a wonderful book to read to young children.  I look forward to reading the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia series.      The story is about four siblings that are sent away from London during the Nazi Germany bombing campaigns during WWII.  They go to live with a professor at his large and strange house in the country.  During a rainy day it is discovered that a wardrobe in an empty room leads to the new and strange land of Narnia.  The four siblings then go on the adventure of their lives.       I'm a 35 years old male and I don't know why, but I had never read any of The Chronicles of Narnia books by Mr. C.S. Lewis.  After reading The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe what a shame it has been to not have read them before.  My wife and I saw a trailer for the upcoming `Chronicles' movie by Disney, Prince Caspian.  We both thought it looked interesting and decided we should watch the first movie being The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe before seeing Prince Caspian.  After reading some of the reviews of the book I decided it would be worth the time to actually read each of the books before seeing the corresponding movie which brings me to the place of reading The Lion... this weekend.  Books are almost always better than their corresponding movies and I think it's important, if possible, to read the books first so your imagination can take over and you are not placing the faces and voices of the movie characters into the reading realm.  I highly recommend this book and will be reading the rest Mr. Lewis' Chronicles series.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|The sad element here is that this majestic piece of musical artistry will go largely ignored in the U.S. Mike Oldfield has created an expansive and inspirational work of great impact here.  My first listen was in my car where I was struck by the tone and range of the work.  At home, through my surround system (hey, why no 5.1 release???), the music naturally came fully to life and elicited many emotions and feelings.  Oddly enough, at times I felt I was hearing the score to an epic film, yet one with quiet and contemplative moments.  This is music with purpose, context, and meaning.  If Tubular Bells was the prologue, this, then, is the masterwork. I will be buying more than a few copies for my friends.    Mr. Oldfield should \\"hook-up\\" with P.B.S. to present this work to a wider audience which may not be aware of its availability (although I could not find it in any store in the hinterland of Pittsburgh) and accessibility (for mature and focused listening pleasure).  If P.B.S. can elevate \\"Celtic Woman\\" and other third rate warblers to big-seller-status, surely the same promotional effort can be put forth to genius.    Thanks, Mike, for an essential piece of music for the 21st century!!
B0010X745K|3.0|I bought the movie last Friday and I was going to rate it five stars until the ending. The ending was very disappointing and not the ending I read in the book nor heard in the audio adaptation of the novella. If it had stayed truer to the storyline, I would have rated it higher. It's a shame. The graphics and moodiness of the movie were excellent.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|I was so excited when I heard this movie was being made.  It is one of my favorite Stephen King short stories.  His imagination and attention to details has always brought his books to life for me and they did a great job on the special effects that made this movie exactly how I imagined it to be.  That said I hated the ending, that is the reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves.  I think one of the things I enjoyed about the story is it never had a definite ending and it made you think and wonder.  All in all I am glad I saw it and would recommend it to others.

0374280967|5.0|This whimsical and insightful novella, all 120 short pages of it, is easy to get through and at the same time thoroughly amusing and thought-provoking.  It offers an intriguing scenario for the potential power of literature and a persuasive account of what it must be like to be the Queen of England.  For better or worse it is all fiction, but that doesn't make it any less believable.  Alan Bennett is a skilled writer and a master of humor, who in this case is able both to make us laugh out loud and to persuade us that what he relates truly could happen.  If you decide to read this book you can look forward to three or so hours of sheer delight.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|When Radiohead released IN RAINBOWS in October of 2007, expectations were high. Five years had passed since their last effort, 2003's [[ASIN:B000092ZYX Hail to the Thief]], the longest hiatus the band had yet taken. They also chose a novel method of distribution, letting the customer pay what he wished for digital copies, which often eclipsed discussion of the band's musical evolution. Like many listeners, I first heard the album through the low-quality audio files on the Internet, later switching to lossless files once the box set was released. After a few months of listening to IN RAINBOWS, I think I've gotten to grips with the album.<br /><br />The band has moved a long way from the confrontational political and social themes of 1997's [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]] and 2000's [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]]. While such lyrics were part of the following two albums, they begin to alternate with increasingly personal and hermetic songwriting, and it is the latter type that are prevalent in IN RAINBOWS. There's even a tender love song, something rare to this angsty team.<br /><br />Musically the band continues their retreat from the IDM stylings of their millennium-year work, yet they have sought to further integrate electronics into their rock sound. Regardless of the buzz about how Radiohead is the most innovative major band around, they continue to produce music based on common-practice Western tonality and lasting only the traditional rock song span, so there's only so far they are willing to go. Nonetheless, there are a couple of fresh features here, including a turn to bipartite form (\\"Bodysnatchers\\", \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\") and a prominent interest in arpeggi (\\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\", \\"Faust Arp\\"). Thom Yorke shows a great variety in his vocals here, gruff spoken-style delivery in \\"Jigsaw Falling into Place\\", his typical \\"whining\\" style in \\"15 Step\\", and steady, sweeping singing in \\"Reckoner\\". Even if they restrain themselves to the rules of the rock genre, they are still willing to bend them, which is a lot more than you could say for most major label acts.<br /><br />The good songs here are very good indeed and lead me to give the song a high average rating. Unfortunately, however, nearly half the album seems to be dead weight. \\"Nude\\" and the closing \\"Videotape\\" are musically and lyrically disappointing, and the latter ballad seems to retread with its talk of mortality and the afterlife over where KID A's \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" already went. \\"All I Need\\" and \\"House of Cards\\" are uninspired.<br /><br />In spite of the weak songs, however, the very best of IN RAINBOWS towers over the best of most of the band's other albums. I'd recommend it if you are already a fan, or if you at least suspect you'd like this kind of music.to bend them, which is a lot more than you could say for most major label acts.

0143038419|4.0|There are so many wonderful reviews on the contents of this book already. I can understand the spectrum of opinions as I share some of them. What I find is this book is, if you will forgive me, like box of chocolates: you wouldn't want to eat them all in one sitting or you would tire of the taste of chocolate. I found that, as I read this book over a period of two months, it felt more genuine as real time had passed - and Gilbert's journey had also passed. She is a talented writer, no doubt about it. But the subject matter demands objectivity gleaned through time. Keep it on your nightstand and pick it up the way you might a book about practical encouragement or support. Then, you will not be disappointed, but rather feel you are catching up with an old friend.
0930289234|5.0|I have seen several articles about the new generation of graphic novels, the increasing acceptance of them in literary circles, and also many guides that claim to help turn you into a fan of comics. Invariably these have cited several major works, and Watchmen is one of them. I have only read it once, but plan on reading it several more times. Watchmen has so many connections,  so many story arcs and sub-arcs, and because all of them are nearly flawlessly crafted to fit together, I know this is a novel that no one can fully grasp with one reading. Many say that the drawing style was revolutionary. But, I don't feel like I can comment on that, being that it was published before I was born. I enjoyed the contrasts and almost harshness of some panels, but it might not be palatable for all. This graphic novel was an interesting read, contained perplexing moral conundrums (for me), and was beautifully drawn. I will enjoy this novel for years to come, and encourage all others to give it a try.

B000683VI4|5.0|I sat on this dvd for almost two years before finally deciding it was time to enjoy it, like a bottle of wine you let age in the cellar.  I am glad I watched it. Ok, there are some parts that are not completely credible, but relegate them to the fact that it IS a movie and it doesn't have to be 100% crude-headlines real. Gena Rowlands is one of my favorite actresses and that was my only reason for buying the movie. I am now a fan of Ryan Gosling as well, Rachel McAdams I have only seen in Mean Girls and I have to say she was pretty good here, as well as good old James Garner.   I cannot put into words what the final act of the movie did to me. Sadness, joy, surprise, shock, happyness. Tears, a lot of tears. Of happyness, of sadness, of shock....well. Wow. I loved it.  And Gena Rowlands is still beautiful as ever.  I am glad that movies of this kind are still being done, once in a while.  I think I have only seen one other movie of Nick Cassavetes and it's not even comparable to this one but I will definitely add him to the directors whose work is worth looking out for. I guess he must have inherited something from his wonderful parents :)
B000001GQR|5.0|This very well could be the best Schubert No.9 on disc. It's only real competition comes from Szell, Munch & Krips. The Haydn is equally satisfying. But it is the same recording that is paired with Schumann's 4th, also on DG. I just wish they would have chosen something else (maybe his Tchaikovsky 6th or Brahms 2nd) on one of these two fine discs. I guess that's beside the point, and this is an excellent recording, both in interpretation and sound quality.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|When I saw a short clip of Ellen Burstyn's performance while she was in the run for the Academy Awards I said to myself I had to have that movie, and after hearing how many versions there were and how to find the \\"original\\" one I kinda laugh at myself now.  I expected yes a totally screwed-up movie about drugs etc, but I didn't expect it to be so boring. I was ready to take the disc out several times but then decided something good had to happen.  I didn't understand several things, also Jennifer Connelly's characte was very unsympathetic. Even though Ellen Burstyn must have nightmares thinking of her own brilliant performance, I don't think I will even watch this movie again. It was really hard to get through, not because of the subject, but because it was boring. And the refrigerator scenes were the most dull.  At least I think that if I didn't already have any wish to ever do any kind of drug, I certainly would not have it after seeing this movie. But that's just me.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|Excellent- heard Skinny Love on NPR when Bon Iver was playing SXSW and fell for the whole 'I'm an angsty artist whose band left him and girlfriend dumped him so I went to live in the woods.' I'm a sucker like that-- for the whole Thoreau, Alexander Supertramp deal. Anyhoo- the guy actually made an awesome CD. It is introspective, but not neurotic. It is quiet but not all melodramatic emo. When you listen to it- remember every voice is his and he's playing every instrument. I guess there isn't a whole helluva lot to do in the dead of winter in a hunting cabin in Wisconsin except to create beautiful, magical music. :-)
0671042858|5.0|One of the few King novels in the horror genre that maintains a logical consistency throughout, this work contains one of the most remarkable extended descriptions of the American wilderness ever attempted in literature in English.  A masterful work, and probably the only King novel I will read more than once.  Oh, and by the way, it's scary as hell.  Far and away King's best work.
0452287588|5.0|Theme and Purpose:<br /><br />This is a book about awakening to your life's purpose.<br /><br />\\"To see one's predicament clearly is the first step toward going beyond it. ... Your purpose is to awaken. It is as simple as that,\\" Tolle says, and, \\"If you are not taking responsibility for your state of consciousness, you are not taking responsibility for life.\\"<br /><br />What You Will Hear About:<br /><br />You will hear about how you strengthen your ego through reactivity, addiction, and attachment to complaining, to being right, to belief, to resentment, to drama, to your body, to happiness, to fame, superiority, inferiority, to your job, to illness, to being important, to TV, to entertainment, religions, tribes, groups, nations. Basically, to emotion.<br /><br />Tolle quotes a well known spiritual teacher: \\"If you think you are so enlightened,\\" Ram Dass said, \\"go and spend a week with your parents.\\"<br /><br />But What You Have To Face Isn't You:<br /><br />\\"You may not want to know yourself because you are afraid of what you might find out. ... But nothing you can find out about yourself is you,\\" writes Tolle.<br /><br />This book clearly packs your problems into huge tablets, makes you see them, and gives you a glass of water so they dissolve like Alka Seltzer.<br /><br />There are many glasses of water. Here's a sip:<br /><br />\\"Before you ask any other question, first ask the most fundamental question of your life: Who am I?\\" ... Who you are requires no belief. In fact, every belief is an obstacle. It does not even require your realization, since you are already who you are. But without realization, who you are does not shine forth into this world.\\"<br /><br />Book's Foundation:<br /><br />The spiritual foundation and references consist primarily of the teachings of Jesus and Buddhism, especially Zen. Hindu, Sufi, and western thinkers and philosophers are significant components, as well.<br /><br />Practices on perception and breathing, which you can do in the midst of reading the book, are important ways of imparting the teachings about ego and awareness. So are a number of very human stories.<br /><br />Beyond Tolle:<br /><br />Eckhart Tolle isn't the only guy talking about ego and how to be free of its control so that you would awaken to your true nature. Deepak Chopra's teachings are more crisp. There is a substantial literature on the topic and many brand new books that few know about. Those books fall under a new version of spirituality called nonduality.<br /><br />Jerry Katzo are a number of very human stories.

B000PMGS8G|5.0|It's funny that I just saw this movie yesterday on T.V. and it happens to be one of my favorite movies. Since I missed most of it, I popped in the DVD player and was in the mood to watch it. The picture was good (I have a upconverting DVD player to 1080p and I'm waiting to see the new Aquos Blu-ray player due out in May). The extras are not really appealing but then again that's just me. When I think of extras I like to see deleted scenes, extended versions, interviews with the cast and crew, and bloopers. Check out what's included by clicking on the picture that shows the back of the DVD case here on Amazon.<br /><br />The soundtrack by Queen, is fantastic. The battle scenes are great and the acting was good. It stars Sam Jones, Topol (007: For Your Eyes Only), Timothy Dalton (007: License to Kill and The Living Daylights), Max Von Sydow (The Exorcist and Judge Dredd), and Brian Blessed (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves). Vultan (Blessed), the leader of the hawk men is my favorite. He's hillarious; especially when Flash Gordon (Sam Jones) was playing football with Ming's (Max Von Sydow) guards on Mongo and he happens to hit a guard on their head and then look up into the air and whistle as to look innocent.<br /><br />Flash Gordon is basically on the planet of Mongo which is lead by a tyrannical leader named Ming the Merciless. Ming was bored and is \\"playing \\" with the planet earth before he destroys it. When the scientist Dr. Hans Zarkov traces where the destruction of earth is coming from, he takes Flash Gordon and Dale Harden hostage and on a nice little trip out of the universe and onto the planet Mongo. Can Flash Gordon save earth before it's too late?<br /><br />Even though I was able to buy this DVD on sale, the price is a little steep. You would think there would be more extras. I've bought other DVD's for $20 and yes, there was a lot of extras. As of now, there is only this DVD available as the older one that was released a while ago is no longer available.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you enjoy the Beatles than this is the movie for you, characters  such as Prudence, Lucy, and Jude make this the one to buy. The actors have  voices that will make one cry, \\"Let it Be\\" was amazing! I bought this   movie and I have already seen it seven times, the time line is the sixties  with all the issues of that time, the movie also deals with issues that  can be somewhat contraversial such as recreational drug use and sexual situations, some nudity.
B001041JLE|3.0|There's no doubt that reissuing yet ANOTHER special edition of Thriller could have been more complete. And the fact the the bonus track Got The Hots is ONLY on the Japanese edition is ridiculous. If the record company wants to really make this a start at a 'comeback' for Michael, then they should start by giving fans what they want. What DO we want? How about this. Include the DVD, but also make this a TWO disc set. Include all the bonus tracks from this edition PLUS the bonus tracks from the previous special edition of Thriller (which are DIFFERENT bonus tracks than these) and FINALLY put the long versions of Billie Jean and Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' ON the Thriller album, as Michael originally intended them to be, but was forced to shorten them due to the lack of room on a vinyl LP back in 1982.<br /><br />Anyway, skipping over all the modern remakes--which are mostly the vocals of the new artists, so they aren't so much Michael's songs anymore--the track \\"For All Time\\" is a ballad that sounds very much like Human Nature, which would explain why they both weren't included on the original LP.<br /><br />The reason to buy the Japanese edition instead of this US edition is because \\"Got the Hots\\" is the better track. It's a standard Michael/Quincey upbeat R&B groove from the early 80s, but it is much better than For All Time. It isn't, however, in my opinion, up to the standards of the Thriller that it was rejected from years ago. Maybe that's just because of the passage of time and it sounding sort of dated, while the Thriller songs still sound fresh and familiar. Even so, for hardcore collectors, the Japanese edition is more bang for your buck.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Being a fairly young Pearl Jam fan (I was 4 when they released their classic album \\"Ten\\"), I have had to do a lot of catching up with the many moods and styles of Pearl Jam.  Initially, I strongly disliked some of their slower tracks (Garden, Oceans, Indifference, etc.), but having had some time to listen to them more closely, and having seen five concerts over some 8 years, I have seen how diverse, and truly special, PJ's music can be once Eddie takes center stage and just sits down with his guitar.    The soundtrack here for \\"Into the Wild\\" is a great example of Eddie letting go of all the corporate distractions that he and PJ have had to dodge for over 15 years as one of the more longstanding rock bands of our time.  This album is a wonderful listen, especially if you are a fan of PJ's slower songs.  Done in all acoustics, this albums creates a more intimate connection with the listener, as most of the songs are populated with simply Eddie, his guitar, and you.      Although it is a bit short, the songs are great to listen to many times in a row, and they have yet to tire me out, and I've listened to the album 10 times in the past 3 days.  Pop it in, sit back, and relax to this great example of the older, more matured Eddie Vedder that so many Pearl Jam fans have to come to adore.
0765357151|5.0|For many, this will be the only taste of Matheson.... this story is a good example of his style.  He is very descriptive of scene - If you were around in the 50s/60s you can immediately picture the den, the mural on the wall, the bar!!! Even the colors come through...  In addition to his ability to draw us into his environment, the flow of the story and the thoughtfulness of his science... getting from point A to B is just awesome!!  There is very little need to extrapolate.  He puts the framework right there - and in as spare a style as possible. The shock of realization and the wave of understanding at the end of the story are indescribable.<br /><br />Obviously, the main story is why most folks buy the book, but I highly recommend that you give the other shorter stories a try also.  I guarantee that they will stick with you.  The fetish doll story is a classic and my personal favorite was 'Witch War', a three page story that still haunts me! Oh yes, 'I am Legend' is a great story, but don't forget the rest of the book - you will not regret it.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay
B00132D808|2.0|Panic at the Disco's first effort shined with originality. Including the ingenious hit \\"I Write Sins, Not Tragedies\\". Each single they released off their first CD had a unique quality and personality of its own.    We now have \\"Pretty Odd\\", and I wish it was just that, because their first effort was pretty odd, unusual, different, and fantastic.    Their first single, though catchy \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\", alerted me that if this is the first single off the album, then somethings up.    It was, ...each song is kind of from the same cutout character. Kind of Beatlesque, Folksy and just kind of boring.    I am not looking for hard rocking, screaming songs, but these songs just don't pop out. They just lay there. The production, and instrumentals are very good, as well as of course the vocals, however the songs need stronger presence of hooks, and melodies.    Panic at the Disco has met the horrible fret of the sophmore slump. I am sorry Panic I really like you, however this album sits like a lump of coal.    Get back into the studio quick before you fade into the woodwork. Your first CD shined with so many great songs. What happened?
B0010X73ZG|4.0|One of the greatest Stephen King adaptations ever made, but my GOD, the ending of this one was brutal. I mean heartbreakingly, almost-ruining-the-movie-for-me brutal. Geez. I mean, just... just GEEZ, Darabont.<br /><br />The story, about a group of people trapped in a supermarket when a mysterious mist encompasses their town, works on a lot of levels. It's part monster movie, part psychological horror, part sci-fi tale and part thriller. It's a harsh, unforgiving look at the human condition, and it works, right up until an ending that, in my opinion, goes just a little too far. Still, it's a good film, and a definite recommendation to all Stephen King fans.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|This is a great movie, very entertaining. My wife & I loved it. I'm so glad they made this Stephen King short story into a book. The ending is classic.

0321544080|5.0|This book is a rare glimpse into the heart and mind of a fine artist.  If you are looking for a recipe book, this isn't it.  There are many fine photographic cookbooks out there that we have all learned from, but this book goes way beyond them.  Enjoy the journey and you will gain insights far more valuable than \\"steps 1, 2, 3.\\"  Many of Joe's images are famous or memorable and I found it fascinating to learn how he approached his assignments and subjects, while overcoming seemingly impossible obstacles.  I now view those images with even greater admiration after learning how much preparation and creativity went into them.  Photography is all about light...and Joe is the Jedi Master of Light, seamlessly blending in what nature provides and humans create.  Each complements the other without competing for space within his images.  Most professionals design their work around fairly narrow slices of the field....and they are great at it.  Joe takes us on a journey that is stunning in the sheer range of demanding assignments.  I found myself wanting to have been at Star City, fly with the Blue Angels, dive in that submarine, talk with Linus Pauling and bask in the beauty of Michelle Pfeiffer.  This experiential book took me on a journey that I will never be able to live myself, which is the essence of all great books.  I have often purchased stunningly beautiful portrait books with only the subject's name as a footnote.  I always wonder....What are they really like?  How did you shoot it?  What did the photographer learn from the experience?  Joe provided all that in a humorous, humble and insightful manner.  Thanks, Joe, for the ride!  John C. Bruckman
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a perfect gift for an WW II buff.  The heroism and the horror of war are no better displayed than in the story of Easy Company, 506 PIR, 101st Airborne.  After watching this, you might just begin to understand, through the experiences of this \\"band of brothers\\", what it really means to be a hero.
B00133KFGW|4.0|I didn't expect this movie to be much.  I was wrong.  It actually was quite good.  I only got it because of Jonathan Rhys Meyers.  It was a very nice movie(plus a hot guy!!!).  Defintely recommend.
B000002MNL|5.0|5 star album by Moz, mellow and sweet!  My top tracks: Now My Heart Is Full, Billy Budd, Why Don't You Find Out..., I Am Hated For Loving, The Lazy Sunbathers. The rest are also good.  This may be Morrissey's best work!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Each track on \\"Absolution\\" is powerful and beautiful and flows together to create a unique and emotional punch in the gut album. The songs pulse, build, swell, and explode...leaving you satisfied and pressing replay. The lyrics run the gamut of emotion and are delivered with a raw and honest voice by Matthew Bellamy. Christopher Wolstenholme and Dominic Howard add their own individual style and point of view, and it blends together perfectly. This is not your run-of-the-mill indie rock album. It feels larger, more ambitious, and free of any pretension. A true rock gem.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|The two disks of actual greatest hits are the reason to buy this set.  They trace Bruce from the days when he was more of a songwriter for others (Manfred Mann \\"For You\\" and \\"Blinded by the Light\\") to his first major hit \\"Born To Run\\" where you get the unpolished Bruce, to \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" where you get the same gravelly voice but with a certain fluidity to the songs, up though \\"Born in the USA\\" and \\"Human Touch\\" after which his career begins to fade and he rests on his earlier laurels.  Disk three is one of those typical \\"bonus\\" disks that make you realize there is nothing special about any of these songs other than you now know why they were left off the original releases.    But Bruce has been an influence for thirty plus years, and in his heyday he could capture the essence of small-town and blue collar America akin to Don Henley, Bob Dylan, Bob Seger, and John Prine.  His songs resonate with casual listeners but moreso with those who actually read the lyrics.  When you read the lyrics, you see a side of Bruce that recognizes personal struggles with daily issues: war, divorce, job loss, and religion to name a few.  No one person can put all of life's struggles into verse, but Bruce does a pretty good job of raising the bar for others to follow.
0375703764|5.0|This is no easy journey, but well worth the trip. So may layers to peel away, but the story is fascinating, and eerie, and unexpected, and utterly original, and written in a truly original and stunning style. You will be haunted by this book....in a very good way, hopefully.
B000PAU032|4.0|le tracce contenute spazziano da composizioni tipicamente orchestrali a brani di stampo più moderne..molto emotivo..fa scaturire varie sensazioni..dalla gioa all'amore, dalla riflessione alla tristezza.  non comprensibile da molti al primo impatto ma dentro c'è tutto il nostro essere.
0786869143|1.0|This is one of the most amateurish books I have ever come across. The content as well as the writing style are just bad and almost childish. A highschool student would write better than this. I was totally dismayed at such a poor treatment of the subject especially by a professional doctor.
0061544493|1.0|I have to say on the outset that I really, really wished that this was a wonderful book. I am not the sort of person who shells out my hard earned dollars on a book that is just mediocre.<br /><br />But the sad truth is this book is worse than just mediocre, it is a total rip off of all the best fashion tip bibles around (and I should know, given that I collect fashion books - there was not one piece of fashion advice included within this book by Posh Spice that I had not read elsewhere before and my honest recommendation is that you purchase instead the bible \\"The Pocket Stylist by Kendall Farr\\", which is simply THE BEST).<br /><br />I do not know why but honestly thought there was a chance Posh Spice could be nice but reading this book has only proven to me that she is the fakest, most shallow and detached from reality person around. For Gods sake, she WEARS FAKE TOENAILS, SHE'S WORN HAIR EXTENSIONS, SHE SAYS SHE REFUSES TO GO ON A TREADMILL BECAUSE SHE CANT IMAGINE WEARING JOGGERS YET REFUSES TO TAKE OFF HER REQUISITE HIGH HEELS (this made me wonder, is she really that short? Only a very short person could be that obsessed with heels...)<br /><br />Buying this book was like purchasing a book from the fake desperate gold digger Imelda Marcos - it left me feeling shocked, embarrassed and disgusted (at myself) all at the same that I could purchase something written by someone so fake and contrived. (Was I too fake and contrived? Is that why she appealed to me?)<br /><br />Honestly her best asset is her super hot husband David Beckham and if he left her the worlds eyes would be on the next young sexy thing he chose to be with and the world would finally see how cheap Posh looks in comparison.<br /><br />I am now torn between keeping this book so as to remind me of the fake person I hope I NEVER, EVER become or selling it on e-bay in order to recoup some of my dignity and respect. I think I might go for the latter and put it towards the purchase of the classic and very expensive photo book of Kate Moss who is the true style queen.<br /><br />Honestly compare the two ladies Kate and Posh and it will be quite evident who is real guru of fashion:<br /><br />Kate always looks relaxed and that in itself is beautiful and highly stylish. It also looks as though it took minimal effort, as though she could join in an impromptu game of soccer in the park or have a good rough and tumble with the kids. She is simple, effortlessly stylish and best of all NATURAL. So why not steal her style tips instead?<br /><br />Whereas Posh, gosh what can I say other than to me now she looks (and the book confirms her to be) truly contrived, like an insecure teenager trying so hard to fit in, but who at night cries herself to sleep because it is all such hard work and the mask that she was hiding behind she can no longer take off because it has become her life.<br /><br />I didn't want Posh to be such a try-hard but that is what the book confirmed her to be...and unfortunately nauseatingly so

B00005LANG|5.0|Bob Marley & The Wailers-Exodus *****<br /><br />Released in 1977, the year that 'punk broke' Exodus was the most important album to emerge that year, not The Sex Pistols' Never Mind The Bollocks, not The Clash, not L.A.M.F., no, Exodus far passes those in terms of importance, and really in over all quality. The overall spirituality and tone of the album is very different from all the other albums the group had previously released. The same can be said for the production of the album and the band, both of which are tighter and sound better then any other album the band ever recorded, though that does not make this the groups best album.<br /><br />Exodus was released and recorded while Marley was living in England after fleeing his home land due to a assassination attempt on his life. This may explain the sudden change in subject matter. Marley was always known for being very spiritual but it seems as though the hit on his life brought him closer to his faith, songs like the angelic 'One Love' the equaly big hit 'Three Little Birds' and the albums incredible opener 'Natural Mystic' are excellent examples of this. Marley had also been known as some what of a rights activist for his people, but living in another part of the world seemed to have brought peace to his mind about the harsh conditions back home because he was more focused on his universal truths such as fate.<br /><br />Songs like 'Jamming' and the beautiful 'Waiting In Vain' brought Marley & The Wailers to the masses. These songs along with basically the rest of the album made the group giants in the United States and in the U.K. where seven of the albums songs became hit singles, and for that, bringing a whole style of music to the rest of the world on that large of a scale, Exodus is easily one of the most important albums ever made.<br /><br />With such great songs and amazing musicianship in the group Exodus is a instant classic and essential for all those interested in any form of music. Though I must say that this is not the best album by the group, it is a very close second, but with out any question, Catch A Fire, the groups first album is the best. The group plays tighter then ever here, showing that change is not always a bad thing, that it is not something to fear, but also showing once again that Marley never wrote any bad material.t album by the group, it is a very close second, but with out any question, Catch A Fire, the groups first album is the best.

0393324818|5.0|This book is an awesome story of how the Oakland A's produced great teams on little money.  Take baseball out of the story and you will learn some solid business principals!  In the midst of telling the story of how a team can compete with or without much money is the story of some great men fighting to become the best they can be.  Michael Lewis did a incredible job of telling the story of life in business and how sometimes unpopular decisions bring the best results.  Great book for any baseball fan or any business man trying to compete with giants.  Great Book
B000ZLFALI|2.0|I seldom encounter a movie that I cannot watch all the way through. But this was such a film. I almost feel like apologizing for not sticking through to the end. I acquired it in a group of 4 for $20 DVDs offered by a video store, attracted by the title and the nicely done cover.<br /><br />The portion I watched was a bit reminiscent of \\"Hair,\\" a 1979 film that also dealt with the Vietnam war, but was more theatrical and choreographed very differently. Also, \\"Hair\\" was a screen adaptation of a stage production.<br /><br />I just can't put my finger on why I didn't want to watch \\"Across the Universe\\" through to the end, other than that I found it slightly boring. As I think about it I can conjecture that perhaps I really didn't want to revisit the Vietnam era. I thought some of the sequences seemed a bit crowded with performers or groups of people. The production was good, the actors well chosen, dancing excellent. I would have liked to hear a little more punch in the songs ... the actors had good singing voices, but were like many persons with good voices that are not used to projecting a song with pop and intensity. There was just one, other than the guest artists, that had that punch, the girl with long curly hair.<br /><br />I slightly missed some of the Beatles' interpretations of some songs. I really wanted to like this movie. (Maybe I'll give it another go.) In the meantime, I want to say that my opinions are solely mine and I don't intend to argue with those who gave it a five star rating. They saw and heard something engaging and entertaining that I didn't and couldn't ,,, for the moment.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I watched North and South solely because of the reviews on this site.  There was so much positive listed that I couldn't believe so many could be wrong.  They weren't.  This film was fantastic.  Like many have said before this film hooks you and you need to see the next segment and the next until you've completed it and then you don't want it to end because it was so good and you want it to keep going. I don't know the last time I've seen something like this.  The acting is wonderful, you feel what the characters are feeling, you are drawn into what they're going through.  I can't add to what has already been said, only...yes, it is that good
B0002DB52M|1.0|This movie is despicable.  It's full of National Socialist ideology and I AM NOT KIDDING.  Lars \\"von\\" Trier didn't get the nickname \\"von\\" from building model planes.  The guy's buddies in college just couldn't get over his resemblance to certain bad-guys from old World War II movies.     What's horrifying about this monstrosity is how few people understand that this is pure, unrefined hate.  Apparently, most folks just believe that Nazi's were about antisemitism and jazzy uniforms.  Well, no.  Adolf Hitler could have written this.  \\"Mein Kampf\\" and \\"Dogville\\" have the same plot.  A young person is ruthlessly exploited, but then turns on her(his) exploiters and has revenge.      I don't believe in censorship, but this movie should be required, by law, to have a warning label.  The label should explain, in detail, what a National Socialist is and what it means to exploit revenge and hatred and rage.  This movie should be shown to a wide audience, but only to educate them about the nature of the enemy, and how easy it is to be pulled-in by the appeal to raw emotion.    Make no mistake-- this film is propaganda.  The sequel (Manderlay) is just as bad (but emphasizes the racism that always a part of Nazi ideology).  See them both for an education in evil.    So... if you're wondering why this film hasn't been despised for what it is... just read the newspapers and watch FOX News and think for moment.  As the man said, \\"What we have here is failure to communicate.\\"  Our society has failed to teach our children what Adolf Hitler and his pals sold to the German people.  Now, when it's trotted out with a fresh coat of paint, nobody recognizes it--and that makes it dangerous.
1594489505|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this book. I liked it better than the Kite Runner. I did like the Kite Runner also.
1580088694|5.0|This book should, in my opinion, be assigned reading for everyone in so-called first world countries.  What the author manages to accomplish is nothing short of remarkable- chronicling one week of food consumption in a number of families around the world.  The text is well-written and informative, but it's the photographs that speak the loudest.  To compare the weekly food consumption of a US or German family with that of a Sudanese or Mongolian family is haunting and recalibrates what we take for granted.  Highly recommended.
B00002ND77|5.0|Epic films about influential martyrs who die young, whether the subject is Lincoln, JFK, or Malcolm, rarely attract my attention or hold my interest.  The best one can hope for is that a point of view stops short of propaganda, that it doesn't fall prey to a white-washing, or black-washing, of a story that has already taken on the stuff that mythic dreams are made of.  Lee's movie and Washington's performance are both so powerful that one can easily forgive many of the broad strokes, enjoy the film, and evaluate the sum effect--which at least has the potential to bring about a fuller understanding of race and religion than the daily political-media noise to which most of us are otherwise continually exposed.<br /><br />Malcolm comes across as a practicing idealist, a man of the highest integrity and most rigorous discipline capable of realizing his vision of a brotherhood whose awareness of its lineage will bring forth the very best moral intentions and practices.  Although the problematic divisions of Islam into Sunni (Malcolm's alignment) and Shia, along with the distinctions between Islam and the Nation of Islam, are merely suggested and the break with Elijah Muhammad due to the latter's \\"woman problem\\" is glossed over, in the end the movie's importance rises above attention to such details.  Malcolm is a hero, a role model and, most importantly, the inspiration for a meaningful, potentially constructive, mythic legacy that, like similar narratives centered on Lincoln or JFK, cannot outsize its human source beyond the point of credibility.<br /><br />If one accepts the current tendency of the population to bifurcate its citizenry into black and white, the hope has to be that those who see themselves as black will see in Malcolm's separatism not segregation and exclusionary practices but a rallying cry to accept one's identity as a full-fledged member of a human race empowered to pursue and achieve excellence regardless of (not because of) color.  What Malcolm perceived as a flaw (his white genes transmitted by rape through his mother) became, after all, his strength.  As for those members of the audience who identify themselves as white, the hope has to be that the uneasy feelings provoked by Malcolm's stance of separatism will bring about self-recognition of the assault to personal worth brought about not simply by exclusionary practices or the publicized statements of a \\"social radical,\\" but by generations of whites practicing \\"Biblically sanctioned,\\" legislatively licensed segregation.<br /><br />At its best, cinema has the potential to be a reflective screen, a mirror of our social and private lives, exposing the best and worst in us all.  Individually, few figures in America's history have so effectively mirrored \\"white America\\" to itself as Malcolm X.  Together, the two--film and Malcolm--make for a potent mix, a powerful chemistry that, we can only hope, will continue to exert its clarifying powers on the diversely colored stage that is being set for the coming year's test of a nation's ability to practice the democracy that it professes to prize above all else.(his white genes transmitted by rape through his mother) became, after all, his strength.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|Made in the early 70's, this documentary is still the best one available on WWII, augmented by the fact that it was made while many of the participants were still alive.  The documentary includes many interviews with eyewitnesses and actual combatants.  The filmmakers, by their own admission, do not cover every aspect of the war (such an endeavor would require watching 100's of hours of filem) yet it still covers many of the major events and gives the viewer a very clear sense of how the war affected so many (the losses, the victories, the horror and human suffering) and how it shaped history.
0143038419|5.0|I just loved this book and felt like Elizabeth Gilbert was my friend by the end. I was in Costa Rica up in the mountains doing a QiGong course from a grand master and was reading this at the time. It was the part where she was in India. What an ideal place to be when reading this. After I came home and read it again. Everyone should read this. It just warms your heart.

I got this at Amazon for 10s of dollars cheaper than offered at retail stores.  This set will last years, and offer me, my five kids and THEIR kids DAYS of C&H rainy day reading fun.  Cheers to Bill Watterson for creating a rich character and a beautifully-illustrated, boundary-stretching strip.  And thanks to Watterson for validating my own very Calvin-like childhood.

B0010X745K|3.0|I just watched this DVD over the weekend and was sadly disappointed with this adaptation of a really good Stephen King novella.  The CGI was only decent and the huge praying mantis like creature was just goofy.  This story followed King's storyline for the most part, but the ending was so far off that it was like a completely different story.  This is unlike the director's two previous efforts, The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.  They were much more accurate and true to the King stories, from start TO finish, and turned out to be wonderful movies.  This one, not so much.  I should state that I have read everything King has ever written and had the same feeling after watching this one as Kubrick's marginal adaptation of The Shining.  The ending is simply implausible.  People here have applauded it for being outside the normal Hollywood type ending, but it would never happen.  The ending in the novella was much better and actually, would have been far more outside the typical happy Hollywood ending.  Which, aside from the implausible actions of the main character, was still a happy Hollywood ending... woo hoo - humanity created nightmare wreaks havoc for a couple of days, then magically is cleaned up and humanity is saved.  Sorry, but this just doesn't merit anything more than three stars, and I think I'm being generous with that.

Loves to dance to the music and he's never had it fall over when he pulls himself up with it.  Only improvement that can be made, have more balls included. We use it with more balls then the 3 it came with, he loves putting as many in it as possible.
B000002TQV|5.0|This is not only my favorite Radiohead CD of all time, but it may be my favorite album of all time.  Every song is amazing, and flow perfectly into one another (not like that \\"Fitter, Happier\\" track that I would always skip on OK Computer).  This is Radiohead at their best.  Radiohead will never sound like this again.  I keep buying new Radiohead albums hoping that I might catch a glimpse of this Radiohead, but now that they're on top of the world doing what they like and not what the label wants to hear they will never return to this golden age.  I have also bought all the music recorded between Pablo Honey and OK Computer.  I would recommend you do the same.  I was listening to this album my senior year in high school, and I still throw it on on occasion.  It's replay value is amazing..
0684865130|4.0|Catch-22 was unique among the other World War II novels that I have read.  The characters, such as Yossarian, Milo and Major Major Major were quirky and satirical and, though many aspects of the story relating to World War II were embellished and fictionalized, Joseph Heller was still able to convey a powerful message; war is illogical and absurd.  Heller's style of writing often seemed unstructured and many of the events that took place made no logical sense.  Milo, in his enterprise which played a large role in the novel, was able to buy goods and then sell them for less money but still make a profit.  The preposterousness of this situation reflected Heller's overall message about war; war is illogical.     Though Heller used satire and humor to describe a very grim time, he successfully conveyed a sense of hopelessness and despair in the men fighting the war.  Yossarian, the protagonist of the story, remained positive throughout but because of his repeated flashbacks to the death of one of his comrades, Snowden, we see that beneath Yossarian's upbeat exterior, he was in fact severely traumatized. In one of the final chapters of the novel, Heller vividly described Snowden's death.  Because this was such a sharp contrast to the prevailing satirical tone of the novel, this scene becomes much more powerful and imbued a sense of utter despair.     Although I found most of the characters and many parts of the book humorous, I also found the book long winded.  The book was often repetitive and, though this was done intentionally to be humorous, I became bored with the book.  Also, I found some of the dialogue very confusing.  Overall, Catch-22 was intriguing but did not capture my attention.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This album is flawless.  Gish is a close second, but this album is alot more polished than Gish.  This album makes me nostalgic for high school and summers in Upstate NY visiting my cousins.  It was a time where we had no worries and we just played baseball all day and went to parties every night.  Any music that reminds you of a very specific time in your life is timeless in itself..
B000UR9T8C|4.0|I enjoy it very much.  Lots of action. The story moved along well and the villains were outstanding.
B000X5KSWM|5.0|None of the reviews that I read seem to touch on the topic that this is a great album if you like opera/film/ or a big symphonic metal fan. It is a lame album if you want a Gothic rock or heavy metal experience.      As for me it was just what I was looking for. A few songs like lost Northern Star are heavy and resemble Nightwish. Most of the album takes on an atmospheric tone with lots of violins and acoustic sounds and limited drum patterns that are simplistic and in the background when they do occur. The entire album is dripping with emotion and feeling. Strong operatic tones mixed with some more contemporary singing is done in what I would rate as Tarja's best vocal performance to date.     While the song writing is great and the album takes on a much neglected softer side to symphonic metal I must admit that it lacks the complex vocal arrangments of say Therion and even takes a step backwards from the duet stylings of Nightwish. There is one guest appearance of male vocals that sound like Nightwish and one instance of a choir being used, but mostly the entire album is just Tarja singing. Though she sounds very good and puts a lot of feeling into it, she is not the most talented Operatic singer out there and seems to fall a little short (and I know die hard Tarja fans will disagree with me) just a little short of some of the competition (like Liv of Leaves Eyes). There are no guitar solos and what guitars are in the album (some of them acoustic, some rock) they are not bad, but not impressive either. The music is not beat based and the drumming is pretty simplistic as well. The violen scores are probably the most impressive aspect of the album besides the singing. So while I give it 5 stars it has limitations. If you are looking for an atmospheric operatic album heavily influenced by film music with only a few small rock elements for flavor this is a good album. If you are looking for a rock album with opera singing and screeching guitar solos this will disappoint. If you are a classical music fan you will also find it lukewarm because despite what metal fans think tarja is not the greatest opera singer, though she isn't bad either.

B000ULPFH2|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest crime dramas ever. Al Pacino is excellent along with Sean Penn who is a phenomenal actor. I highly recommend this movie.
0793509602|5.0|I bought this for my 14yo, along with Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar.  They must be good because he leaves them all over the house after he's used them.  They keep moving around, so he must be using them.
0375758992|5.0|I found this in audio at an audio rental store.  The front intrigued me so I read the back and decided to give it a go.  I liked it so much that my husband decided he wanted to listen to it too! What an interesting life to have lead at such a young age!
1577312082|5.0|I first got these cd's at the library.  I was so impressed with Mr. Tolle's spiritual teachings that I was led to purchase the audio cds immediately.  I listen to them on my way to work and back home again.  It is so enlightening and explains so much why we feel and do the crazy things we do.  I feel priviledged to have been able to listen and learn from this wonderful presentation.  Mr. Tolle's voice is so peaceful and grounded that I enjoy more listening to him read the book on cd then reading it myself, which I have done also.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking true spirituality and the disciplining of their mind.

0143038419|1.0|Unfortunately, this book was chosen as the book of month for my book club. Let me just say, the moment I picked it up , I despised this woman.     I had a sense that this book was contrived from the first few pages, but then when I found out that she was given an advance before going on this so-called \\"self-journey\\", I shook my head in shame for dishing out money for this shameless account of selfish dribble.

B000002UB6|3.0|\\"Let It Be\\" is final Beatles album released even if it was in fact recorded before Abbey Road during the sessions of January 22 1969 to Jan 31 at Apple Headquaters,their company instead of the Abbey Road studio.There`s no hidding it,at this point of their career,there was a lot of tension and that affected Let It Be.By that time Ringo and George has already left once,tought they would come back soon after things were never the same.It was indeed a job at that point for The Beatles,once a dream it had now severly taken a beating,it wasn`t fun to be in the band anymore.Paul wanted the band to play live again for his own reasons,probably so they could work more as a unit,who knows?I don`t think what he wanted worked very well as the band instead was disfonctional and sadly the material on here suffered from it.<br /><br />The band eventually split in 1970 after Let It Be`s release as Paul announced he quit the band and no one was comfortable staying in a band like this when things were going bad.Its still a little surprising that even if Let It be was recorded before Abbey Road,on Abbey Road they were better and each musician focused on the music and they putted thier differents aside in order to make a great rock album,wich they did.On Let It Be as it can be seen in the movie it was chaos(Paul told George exactly what to be,leaving no place for his creativity you should have seen poor George...),the session wasn`t that good but still someone decided to release it and that might not have been expected.That`s not to say its awfull and its not listenable but its not the greatest Beatles albums,in fact its pretty much at the bottom if you want to know the thruth.Every fan with sense can tell you that.<br /><br />The songs are a mixed bag really,there are some good songs such as \\"I Me Mine\\" that stand out while there are other short meaningless songs such as \\"Maggie May\\"(like the song but its too short to go anywhere)and \\"Dig It\\".A few songs can be considered good and all but its not up to what The Beatles could really do.I do like so songs as stated above,like \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Across The Universe\\",tought I must say this really does feel as if it was the band`s last album.You can`t compare Let It Be to say Revolver or Abbey Road,it doesn`t have the quality either of those two have and its too different.Those 12 songs are definatly not up to other albums in The Beatles catalogue,and there is nothing to hide that its the soundtrack of the film Let It be wich should already make it less of a great album.And this should interest you,the band didn`t give their approval to make of the sessions an album until nearly a year after,even The Beatles themselves don`t really like it that much I guess im not the only one...<br /><br />Since the original Let It Be album there has been an alternate version \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" wich most Beatles fan consider to be better as it has a few differences with this particular versions.That is another interresting story but its another story.Some other reviewers make the comparisons but i won`t.Anyway this is one of the few ocassions where The Beatles did misteps.Its also to note that most tracks if not all of them are live on Let It Be.It was definatly a bad thing to bring Phil Spector in as he mostly messed up the album while there are really few exceptions to that rule.Despite all there is still some good in it and its worth owning as any other Beatles albums,be advised its one of their worst tought there are some good songs and all.It was never intended to be released but it did anyway,its still nice to hear that stuff.Being objective I give it 3 stars,not the best that is five,but neither the worst that is 1 star,its in between.to what The Beatles could really do.I do like so songs as stated above,like \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Across The Universe\\",tought I must say this really does feel as if it was the band`s last album.You can`t compare Let It Be to say Revolver or Abbey Road,it doesn`t have the quality either of those two have and its too different.Those 12 songs are definatly not up to other albums in The Beatles catalogue,and there is nothing to hide that its the soundtrack of the film Let It be wich should already make it less of a great album.And this should interest you,the band didn`t give their approval to make of the sessions an album until nearly a year after,even The Beatles themselves don`t really like it that much I guess im not the only one...

B000Z27HLS|5.0|Scriptwriter Andrew Davies here shows the skill that was so effective in his 1995 adaptation of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  With only 90 minutes at his disposal, he manages to include all essential characterization and plot.  As in any adaptation, a lot of the elements that make a Jane Austen novel what it is -- wit, language, satire -- had to be omitted or given short shrift (her fun with the poseurs in Bath, for instance).  There is some fun with Catherine's vivid imagination, stoked by her avid reading of Gothic novels, but it isn't altogether clear that Austen was making fun of such novels, which were extremely popular at the time she wrote her novel.<br /> On the whole, the cast is adequate, and Felicity Jones as Catherine and JJ Feild as Henry are considerably more than that, followed closely by Catherine Walker as Eleanor and Liam Cunningham as General Tilney.
0525950079|5.0|This is a really great book. I bought it as the sequel to Pillers of the Earth. I was not a bit disappointed in either book, and have recommended them to several other people.

B00005JPLW|2.0|Well, hey, if YOUR into this sort of thing, that's cool. It's cool. You know \\"Different Strokes For Different Folks\\" as they say. I have nothing against homosexuals. Gay porn isn't immoral or whatever. So, enjoy 300 with your buddies. Feel free to be yourself.<br /><br />I think a good idea would be to after the movie is over play like a 300 game. \\"This is Sparta!!!!\\" Clear some space in the living room. Well, do first make sure the parents aren't home and then a good space. Also, no girls. Then divide the guys up into, you know, the two armies. Next -and now, don't be shy about it-YOU ARE A WARRIOR- disrobe. Wear only underwear, preferably \\"huggers\\". If you have speedos, perfect. Next, and this is important, you must have oil. Get some baby oil and apply liberally to yourself. Everyone will of coarse need assistance getting the hard to reach spots. Remember, you are a warrior now, so there is no room for shyness. Finally, get a mat or something to cover the floor with so oil isn't smeared on the carpet. What you then do is wrestle, one on one. To learn the rules of greco-roman wrestling, just make sure to hop online or order a book from Amazon. The winner of each match goes on to play a winner from the opposing side in another match, until you have your champion. The winner will be king, ruler of you all, for the rest of the day. Now, this means that __anything__ he says goes. He is in complete charge and basically everyone are his slaves. Perhaps he will demand that you prove your loyalty by doing exactly what he wants. He may order you to do the most crazy, outrageous things, but this is Sparta now. In Sparta what you normally do does not matter, you don't matter. You either rule or be ruled.

0307383415|3.0|This first autobiography, which was first published in 1995, sheds a lot of light on the early development of Senator Obama. The sections about his first job in Chicago and his trip to Kenya to re-trace his roots are informative. As the title suggests, most of the book is devoted to his search for his father's roots and the considerable influence this mostly-missing father had on his life.

The finale is a treat with 17 Jean ValJean characters from all the productions world wide performing the rousing \\"DO YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SING\\". This is a must see ......!

1556347308|5.0|I've been contemplating the purchase of this book for a couple of years now, and finally broke down to make the purchase.  The physical object itself is a thing of beauty.  It has the lovely full color design and quality printing and binding that past purchasers have come to expect from GURPS products.<br /><br />This isn't a product for somebody who wants to buy it and run a game the next weekend.  GURPS itself is less a game than a toolkit for making your own game.  Once you have the rules, you need to either create your own setting and character archetypes (what GURPS calls templates), or you need to purchase one of the many game world books published for use with the game.  Fortunately the book provides a lot of good guidance and examples.  The published material that describes game worlds is also excellent.  The high quality of this supporting material is what helped me decide to purchase [[ASIN:1556347294 GURPS Basic Set: Characters, Fourth Edition]] and [[ASIN:1556347308 GURPS Basic Set: Campaigns (4th Edition)]].<br /><br />Given that caveat, I recommend this product for any gamer who wants to expand their gaming into new directions.  There's nothing revolutionary here, but this toolkit gives you what you need to produce any other kind of game that you want to play.  You might want to play ghost hunters right now, but in six months you can switch to a space opera, and six months after that to cape-wearing super heroes. And for any of those options, you can purchase additional supporting material, or just wing it on your own.  The number of games you get by purchasing this one set of books makes it an excellent bargain for the serious role player.

B000ZN802W|5.0|I do not see this as a story of man vs wild. It is, in my opinion, the profoundly sad story of a lost soul. This young man set out to learn about himself, and he thought he could do it by leaving behind his family and his life. Through his journey, he encountered people who seemed to need him, and I think they learned something about themselves from having met him. Sadly, however, he left each encounter just when he felt himself getting close...to caring, to love, to the essence of what we all need in life. If only he had paid attention and learned from the people he met on his quest, he might have lived to share his wisdom with others. He found joy in the beauty of the natural world, but too late he realized that joy is meant to be shared. So this is the story of man vs himself and the consequences of a broken spirit without inner resources.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Essentially the TV spinoff of Saving Private Ryan, this series is just incredible.  Not once do I ever feel as though I am watching actors.  Not once do I ever feel withdrawn from the reality of what these soldiers overcame to stop the spread of tyranny.

B000XTLUW0|5.0|The last time Muse toured through my city, they were the opening act for My Chemical Romance. Such a thing doesn't seem fair for a band that can sell out Wembley Stadium, one of the world's largest sports facilities, twice in two days. This CD/DVD set is from those two famous shows and contain almost every great song Muse has ever written.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I've never been a fan of live CDs. Why pay money to hear a band perform something live when you can just pay the same amount and get a better, studio-quality recording? The same holds true for the CD in this set. Though the songs are performed greatly and it has one song that the DVD doesn't (boo), \\"Microcuts,\\" it's just not the same experience as watching the DVD. A live show, especially one on this scale, is equally about visual stimulus as it is audio. That's why I'm focusing this review mainly on the DVD, because it's amazing, awe-inspiring, and it make me wish that I actually went to the Muse show the last time they came through my town.<br /><br />In a word, this performance is massive. The band enters the stage from the middle of the stadium, rising up onto a platform, before making the long walk down to the absolutely gigantic stage. Once there, they embark on a nearly 2-hour long concert that is one of the most mind-blowing spectacles I have ever witnessed on a DVD. The set goes through different phases, opening with huge numbers like \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" and \\"Hysteria\\" and really pumping the crowd up. Matt eventually moves over to a grand piano where he plays \\"Apocalypse Please,\\" \\"Hoodoo,\\" and \\"Feeling Good.\\" Things pick back up soon after and the band plays a couple of their more heavy tunes before leaving the stage for a brief intermission.<br /><br />They reenter shortly after, Matt carrying an acoustic guitar on which he plays \\"Soldier's Poem\\" and \\"Unintended.\\" This is really the most flawed portion of the act, as \\"Soldier's Poem\\" isn't really a crowd pleaser by any means. Fortunately, this section is followed by the performance of \\"Blackout\\" which is truly breathtaking. During this amazing number, there are actually trapeze artists suspended from gigantic orbs overing hundreds of feet over the crowd. It is worth buying this DVD to witness, as it\\"s probably the most beautiful thing I've ever seen at a concert.<br /><br />Overall, I've found Haarp to be an awesome piece of media to add to my collection. Though the experience given on the CD is nowhere near as impressive as that found on the DVD, for the price, you really can't go wrong. Though I'm a little upset that \\"Citizen Erased\\" is nowhere to be found on this set, I'm more than happy with it. After seeing The Flaming Lips live, I was pretty much sure that I would never see a show quite as entertaining. After viewing this DVD, however, I can safely say that they have some stiff competition. If you call yourself a Muse fan, you owe it to yourself to pick up this set. Disappointment is not an option.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Knights of Cydonia\\"<br />2. \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\"<br />3. \\"Invincible\\"<br />4. \\"Microcuts\\"<br />5. \\"Take a Bow\\"<br /><br />CD: 7 out of 10 Stars<br />DVD: 9 out of 10 Starshe performance of \\"Blackout\\" which is truly breathtaking.

0440238609|4.0|I read Pullman's work before any controversy had emerged in the public sphere and I was left breathless.    What I read in his writing was some of the most spiritual fictional writing I have ever encountered.  The adventures of Lyra paralleled my own explorations of the fundamental truth of reality on the spiritual and scientific frontier where the power of the individual lies not in the worship of another but in the empowerment within the unified whole.   While we might not have a physical Dust, we do have a metaphysical Dust - a Force that moves amongst all of life and, when consciously discovered, awakens the individual to his or her full powers as the part of God we all are.    Then my Mom, a devout Catholic and teacher, asked me if I'd heard of these books that her priest had written about in the weekly church bulletin, warning parents to keep from their children while at the same time admitting he had not read them himself.  Soon after, the warnings had gone global and I was being told that I read evil works determined to destroy God within children.    That idea simply comes from people still rooted in dogma and unable to yet see the full human potential.  Certainly these books seek to move beyond the notion of a hierarchical, worship-demanding God.  They also seek to move beyond the limitations of one believing his dogma is the one and only true path.  But, in so doing, they move to a deeper understanding of \\"God\\" or \\"Allah\\" or \\"The Spirit of the East\\" or \\"The Force\\"... just as a child moves beyond dependence on a parent.  These books internalize God in the journey of a single child, and thus use fiction to make the argument of whether or not there even is a God  pretty much irrelevant since all that can be accomplished through worship of an external entity becomes possible within a single child.    Wonderful series that will help your children find the God that is each of them.
B00003CX5P|1.0|This was a terrible movie!  After giving us one of the best trilogies in movie history, Lucas does this???  Confused plot, repulsive characters (especially Jar Jar), and ...did anyone REALLY want to see a baby-faced Darth Vader shouting \\"Yippee!\\"  Barf!  It sort of ruined the whole second trilogy for me.  (Although the second trilogy does get better from here!)  I know Lucas was trying to draw in pre-schoolers who had never seen the first trilogy, but did he need to thumb his nose at his older fan base?  If Lucas really cared for his fans he would come out with his own re-edit of this one (sort of like the newer version of the original series) giving us a movie that is watchable for \\"over pre-school\\" fans.  Or at least, instead of trying the sue the phantom editor, he could have included the phantom edit as a special feature on the DVD as a tribute to his fans who loved his work enough to try to cover his mistakes!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I loved this movie which is driven by fabulous words, music and relationships.  The music and songs blended perfectly with the script and enhanced our emotions.  I could feel the joy, pain and everything in between.    I was appreciative of the effort to develop and grow each participant for their own sakes.  Boy and Girl did not end up together, which would have been very cliche, but ended up where they wanted and perhaps needed to be.  What is wrong with that?    I loved the father/son interplay. Although a small part it was telling of the character of the boy and a big credit to the generosity of the father.    All in all, a great movie and proud to add it to my collection.

B0014DC0AK|5.0|This review is not intended to coerce, persuade, or influence newcomers of Death, Chuck Schuldiner, and the amazingly talented music inbetween the two. If one is interested in the basics of Symbolic, please refer to the original release ('95) page where many others can assist you with an abundance of reviews. My review is for the many fans of Death and/or Symbolic.    I am writing this review today (April 1st) because I managed to acquire a copy 3 days early and have been listening thoroughly, over and over. Symbolic was always a personal favorite; a benchmark of supreme technicality and beautiful melody. There is no other way to say it than with this new remaster release, what was/is great has now become greater.    Basically, compared to the original press, the back case art and the liner notes have been revised. New layout/photos with a special page dedicated to the memory of Chuck, photos courtesy of his mom, Beth. Don Kaye contributes a 3 page editorial covering the life of Death as a group, focusing extensively on Symbolic's development (obviously) while getting Gene Hoglan to comment quite a bit throughout. '\\"There have been countless hundreds with whom I've interacted who have said, 'Symbolic is the whole reason I picked up my instrument.'\\" says Gene proudly.' I myself as a percussionist/drummer look up to Gene and practice his material/methods weekly if not daily; the whole reason why I started playing double bass was listening to his consistency and understanding why he's called Gene \\"The Machine\\". You'll never hear a sloppy note. Don also comments that while we'll never know where Chuck would have gone musically, \\"...his legacy shows every indication of the true artist, craftsman and musician he was.\\"    The new quality of the music is sheer grace. Who better for the remastering job than George Marino, the man who did the original mastering in '95. Mainly, the low and high ends have been polished and raised. Gene's bass drums and cymbal accents are more articulate and present, Chuck's vocals are more intense yet smoother, the bass stands out more than the original, and the solos are packed with more clarity and ear-piercing power. All of this is definitely prevalent within '1,000 Eyes', 'Crystal Mountain', and 'Symbolic'. I noticed the most change in those tracks, but it's apparent in the entire album. I was so overjoyed with the results I couldn't stop smiling to myself as I listened, thinking, \\"I can't believe it sounds this good! I never thought 'Symbolic' could EVER be better.\\"    Ah yes, and the treat for us Death fans; the bonus tracks. Four standard demos without vocals and one 4-track demo made entirely by the man himself. I find them fascinating because done in '94, DiGiorgio contributed his whipping bass and Gene worked out complete drum programming. We get to see how the songs evolved, took form, and were original presented. Plus, they all have some variation of the album versions which is fresh air. 'Symbolic Acts' as it was originally named is actually the closest to the final cut of all, 'Zero Tolerance' helped me realize that the intro riff for the guitar is (a+1+e+&+a+2) that extra 'a' 16th note in front of 1, 'Crystal Mountain' is on fire, faster than the final cut, and even though it's a drum machine, it's still pretty awesome to listen to how fast the drum programming is along with faster guitar work, and 'Misanthrope' finds the greatest variation, treated by an enticing acoustic intro and the slower solo replaced by acoustic as well. These 4 demos also display DiGiorgio's flow and presence as a powerful fretless bassist, which is pretty apparent as well. The 4-track is all Chuck, the very first incarnation of 'Symbolic', which is awesome to hear how it all began...    I don't know what to say other than that 1) If you like/love Death, 2) Are a Schuldiner fan, 3) Want to be inspired by one of the most distinct, unmistakable, and unequalled metal albums, pick up this remaster. The drumming behind Death's albums constantly influences me with machine-like accuracy and perfection. One reason I love this remaster so much is I am able to hear more of what accents and articulations Gene is doing, especially on the cymbals (as I said earlier).    I've never had such a large emotional connection to a certain group ever. Chuck's lyrics can apply and relate to everyone (it's Symbolic to everybody). The true-to-life realistic approach in his words are the best I've heard in metal, and this album is definitely the pinnacle of his thoughts/feelings of life. Chuck deserves no less, this remaster is beautiful and a sentiment to his memory; as a passionate person and pioneering musician who accepted nothing but the best. This remaster represents what Chuck stood for, RIP
0143038419|2.0|I purchased the audio version and really wanted to like it with all the hoopla...I can't waste my time any more trying to get into this book. I tried, just not interested. I found my mind wandering and just wasn't keeping my interest.
080701429X|5.0|This is a terrific book about the meaning of Life. However, it is tough reading! You'll find yourself re-reading many passages just to understand the subtleness of the author. It will have a profound effect on anyone searching for some meaning to their lives. Warning: it is sometimes depressing, but enlightening.
B00005J6T1|3.0|I am not a vinyl junkie by any means, however this remaster is nowhere near as good as the original release. It isn't sound quality so much as it is the mix. To me this CD sounds heavy (especially when it comes to the bass) and nowhere near as exciting.     I am also not an audio expert so I can't explain why my vinyl version sounds faster while the running time on the LP and CD remain the same. By faster I mean more vibrant and uptempo.    The album on the other hand is fantastic and I can see why Madonna became the star of the 80's, great dance tunes and lots of energy make this a 5 star album, the poor reproduction on CD reduces it to 3.    To slightly contradict myself I will say if you have never heard the LP then you will enjoy the CD version and I will recommend it as it isn't a poor album it just doesn't match up or exceed what I have heard on vinyl.    TO UPDATE SPEED/TEMPO QUERY:     I must be blind and deaf, Holiday is chopped in half and has a new \\"mix\\" and Burning Up has been shortened and Borderline has been messed with too, Lucky Star actually is faster, it is 7 seconds faster then the CD.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|I didn't know that this story was deemed 'unfilmable' but even without that prior knowledge, I could see how difficult it would have been to put this story onto film.  The intricate sense of smell basically drives the film - specifically the sense of smell of Jeane-Baptiste. One would think this would be impossible to portray on film but it was quite ingeniusly done through the actors and visual effects.<br /><br />Huge, huge kudos to the casting director who found this actor who played the awkward but genius Jean-Baptiste.  I honestly don't think that any oscar-winning actor could have pulled this off as well as he did.  Jean-Baptiste is socially retarded, perverse, even demonic and yet, the way he is portrayed in the film, you can't quite decide whether to be disgusted by him or feel sorry for this disconnected loner.<br /><br />The ending is quite a twist in the story.  Very unexpected and quite extroardinary.  But it is also, to put it bluntly, kind of gross.  But seriously, if you appreciate a well-made film, this film more than deserves your attention.  I give it five stars without reservations.
B000088E6D|5.0|Having already purchased Michael Bublé's two albums, 'Call me Irresponsible' and 'It's time' I was totally hooked on this great singer. Would this earlier album be up to the standard of the later ones? The answer is a resounding YES! With a smooth, sexy voice like Michael's he just can't lose and as with the other albums, the arrangements are brilliant.  Highly recommended!
B000J103WA|5.0|The HD DVD arrived within several days in perfect condition. The quality of video and sound are superb! You can choose between Dolby 5.1 or Stereo for playback. I chose Dolby and felt like I was at the live concert. The  attention to detail with the multiple camera angles is also amazing. This concert really brought me back. I have played it several times with friends (including musicians) and they're impressed with its live feel.
B000022TSW|5.0|South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is a film version of the Classic Comedy Central series that started the V-Chip revolution. The film is about Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman sneaking into an R-rated movie and instantlly, they picked up on the foul dialogue, when the moms got wind of this, they are ready to fight against the people of Canada. There are some really funny moments like Kenny dies and goes to Hell and sees Satan and Saddam Hussein as gay lovers. Please note that like its TV counterpart, the South Park movie is NOT for children, for it has explicit language, graphic violence and sexual contents!
0060507772|4.0|I love discworld.  This was the only book I hadn't yet read.  I've read the others anywhere from two to five times.<br /><br />This one was... okay.  You had to really like the Leonard da Quirm character and Captain Carrot, two of my least favorite characters.  I like Rincewind but he didn't get to play a very large role.  Even the silver horde only got to re-hash their lines from Interesting Times.<br /><br />Basically, if you've read Jingo and Interesting Times you've read all of the narrative and most of the humor in this book.<br /><br />That said - the humor and narrative are a side show for what the book really is... a picture book for discworld fans.  As someone who prefers books over television for the very reason that I get to see the places and people however I choose (occassionally regardless of what the descriptions list) the picture book didn't do a lot for me.<br /><br />And again - that said - the illustrations are truly marvelous.<br /><br />So overall<br />Discworld Baseline: 5 stars<br />Rehashed narrative and been there done that humor: -2 stars<br />Beautiful illustrations: +1 star<br />Overall rating: 4 stars
1604591625|5.0|A common criticism of Orthodoxy is the format, and while people are entitled to criticize the rambling nature of Chesterton's exploration as aesthetically displeasing, there are plenty of rigidly organized explorations of faith; all neat and tidy with headings even. If you read his introductory comments on why he wrote the book, you should be able to see that the whole work focuses on how he stumbled unintentionally into seeing the beauty and reason of orthodoxy through the accumulation of a thousand little things that all pointed in the same direction: God. The book purposely models this, and frankly I find the joy of the book is how he expresses faith this way.   I admittedly found it very confusing my first read, but each time I read it again more and more of it starts to connect. Give the book a second chance if you stumble at first Soon you'll start to see the pattern of thought in his \\"rambling\\" observations, an intentional metatphor for the divine pattern and purpose that escapes us in our everyday \\"rambling\\" lives.

B000ZG5S4M|5.0|I am so impressed with Marianelli's latest musical creation in Atonement.  I know only a couple of years ago, critics picked apart his score to Pride and Prejudice - a soundtrack I, by the way, love.  Yet Atonement is fleshed out so much more fully, although that may be due to its heavier subject material.  Regardless, Marianelli is proving himself as a talented composer.  Good for him!
1594489505|5.0|Sometimes a book is a flash in the pan, but this author has shown that good writing, as well as good stories, can be produced again and again.  I enjoyed this second book, as I enjoyed the first.  It's nice to read something a little different.

B00133KFGW|4.0|Just like the baseball movie, this is about risk, confidence, and ultimately -- the concept of simply having faith. Being a musician helps -- knowing how music can flow through you; be part of who you are; change your perception of life. After this film I had tears streaming down my face -- as much for the movie experience as for those who will just never \\"get\\" this film. If you are a person who has no faith -- in anything, anyone or in a higher power, you will either hate this movie or be challenged to the max. Ask yourself -- is there anything you believe in enough to cast it all aside on faith? In this film, all three main characters did just that.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I came into this movie not knowing much about the stage play. I, of course, like many Burton/Depp fans decided to see the movie for that pair alone. However, I did soem research, and came into the film with a slight knowledge of what he story was and the tone of the play.<br /><br />The movie was exceptional, to echo many of the reviews here. I cannot conclude that the film adapts from the stage perfectly. I cannot make any grand conclusions on the stage score versus the flm score. But, I can attest to the sheer visionary genuius that Burton presents with this film.<br /><br />A fan of musicals, I feel in love with witty, tongue-in-cheek lyrics. I was not shocked to see Depp carry a tune, but rather amazed at how effortlessly he pulls it. Even Rickman was amazing, as I was only a fan of his from the HArry Potter series.<br /><br />Like I said, I am not an elitist, just a moviegoer who was extremely amazed at the production, score, acting,a nd direction of this film. I highly recommend this film to those who may not know abnout the sotry, and definately to those who normally shun musicals.

0452286751|5.0|Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a sensational novel that illustrates the importance of individuality and ego. The diverse, yet familiar, characters captivate the reader in a tale of love, lust, power, and fame. With twists and surprises that always keep the audience guessing, this book is one that you won't be able to put down.         Howard Roark and Peter Keating are two architects with contrasting moral values. With the help of Ellsworth Toohey, a very influential critic and advocate of collectivism and aitruism, Keating gets fame and money, but quickly realizes that he only achieved success with help from others and can not stand on his own when deserted. Roark does not depend on others and is not motivated by fame or money. He relies on only himself and the integrity of his work to get him places.         Dominique Francon refuses to share things she loves with the world that she deems unworthy. She loves Roark but cannot allow herself to be with him. Instead, she marries Peter Keating and then Gail Wynand, a wealthy newspaper tycoon who sacrificed his soul for power and control.         This novel depicts the complex relationships of these characters and their views of society and the world. Their morals and emotions make them come alive and the way they change and grow throughout the story makes them so real! This book really is a must-read that is entertaining as well as thought-provoking. Pick one up as soon as possible!
B00133KFGW|3.0|Whether or not the implausible plot of director Kirsten Sheridan's 2007 \\"August Rush\\" makes much sense or not, the film moves with its own frenetic momentum; the urgent momentum of the music heard inside the head of its main character Evan Taylor a.k.a. August Rush (played by the serious Freddie Highmore of \\"Finding Neverland\\"), musical genius extraordinaire of the caliber of a latter-day Amadeus Mozart.<br /><br />Ordinary sounds like that of the grass blowing in the breeze and the wind hitting an old brass wind chime filter through this child's brain and transform to melodies of symphonic perfection.  From the first few opening frames of the film, there is no doubt in the mind of the viewer that Evan definitely possesses that quirky quality akin to all masterminds, be it the mathematical autistic savant speaking in logarithms or yet another John Nash hearing aliens speak to him through glimpses of magazine and newspaper text.  Through almost monotonous repetition, Sheridan insures that the audience immerses itself in sensing yet not fully understanding this wondrous creative treat--how often do we get to explore the mind of someone of higher perceptive powers?<br /><br />Making use of his unique gift, Evan, living in a home for boys, decides that hearing his personal compositions will provide the means to bring his parents to him in a lyrical happy-ever-after.  We hear his music too (thanks to Mark Mancina's soundtrack) and like the fairytale rats of Hamlin follow this Pied Piper to the streets of New York City where Evan becomes synonymous with Dicken's Oliver Twist complete with an acoustic guitar toting Artful Dodger and somewhat manic-prone-to-violence Fagan (a cowboy hat wearing mutton-chopped Robin Williams.)<br /><br />As Evan wanders through the arch in Washington Square and the abandoned Filmore East Theatre in pursuit of his music, we flash back and forth from the moment of his conception by rock star Louis (the ever intense Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and classical cellist Lyla (America's sweetheart Keri Russell.) Separated by factions that again seem conjured from a world replete with evil stepmothers, the two live their floundering lives in different cities fully conscious of the black hole created by their estranged existences.<br /><br />As Evan's musical ability purrs into a startling fifth gear, the trio moves steadily towards each other like a convergence of heavenly bodies in the night sky in a somewhat wannabe facsimile of a Christmas miracle exemplified with a hopeful magical star. ZZZZzzzzzzz . . .<br /><br />Bottom line?  Although \\"August Rush\\" assembles a fine group of actors to play out one boy's musical rhapsody with all the trimmings, the overall presentation seems overly slick--dusted with a coating of improbable sweetness that may work for family fare if a double dose of sugar is in order but does not contain enough real poignancy to satisfy an adult viewer.  Instead, the film mirrors a tale out of Dickens with all the convenient serendipity and none of the genuine menace to elicit human response or concern.  Highmore pours on the spacey-ness with an almost beatific grin and glow that the best of the litany of saints cannot duplicate while Russell and Rhys Meyers come together with a too-perfect simplicity that moves like a sticky snowball at the light speed of the music.  Williams plays this one too over the top for me--he tries for three dimensional when only one is needed.

0435123432|5.0|This is a wonderful and highly original novel about a mentally challenged man named Charlie who wanted to be smart. One day, his wish was granted. A group of scientists selected him for an experimental operation that raised his intelligence to genius level. Suddenly, Charlie found himself transformed, and life, as he knew it, changed.<br /><br />His story is told entirely through Charlie's eyes and perceptions in the form of progress reports. The reader actually sees the change in Charlie take place, as his progress reports become more complex, well written, and filled with the angst of personal discovery and growth, as well as with his gradual awareness of his amazing and accelerated intellectual development.<br /><br />The progress reports are a wonderful contrivance for facilitating the story, and the reader is one with Charlie on his voyage of self-discovery. What happens to Charlie in the long run is profoundly moving and thought provoking. It is no wonder that this author was the recipient of the Nebula Award which is given by the Science Fiction Writers of America for having written the Best Novel of the Year. This is definitely a book well worth reading.
B0000549B2|4.0|With Lee's first three films, it is obvious that this man has a passion for music. With his fourth film, \\"Mo' Better Blues\\", Lee takes on this passion fully and it is a treat for us viewers and lovers of Jazz. Interestingly, this is a film about passion, that is the life of a passionate person. Like many prolific scholars, artists, and writers Denzel Washington's character, Bleek, makes everything secondary to his music. He is self-absorbed using two woman, both of whom he seems to love, only when HE needs them.  Anyone out there who has experienced a person like Bleek, whose every move revolves around his or her job, hobby or love, will appreciate this film.     This is Spike Lee's first full-fledged dram. Generally I enjoyed this movie, though not as much as \\"Do the Right Thing\\". (I know, its always dangerous and rarely right to compare a director's films with one another, it's best to take them individually). I enjoyed how closely the music reflected the mood. the  pain as Bleek strained to play a year after he was beat up, the dizzying scene when he could not tell who he was in bed with and the scene when he was lying on the floor with headphones on and scattered albums all around him. I also was happy that Lee went full-circle and went ahead in time at the end of the film to show us how things turn out in the future. This is an very simple and often considered \\"corny\\" technique in film making, however I think it is underused and completes a story.    A last thought, Spike Lee seems to develop one character in each of his films (in this film it is Bleek) so well, that the other characters seem of little importance.
1400082773|3.0|I was drawn to this book because I believe Obama to be one of the best political speakers in my lifetime. As I write this review in April of 2008, Obama is in the middle of a tough presidential election and it is hard for reviewers and readers to merely judge the book and not the presidential candidate. Here, I try to review just the book - not the candidate which can be a difficult task.    The book is divided into 3 sections: 1) Childhood through the end of college 2) the largest portion is dedicated to the two and a half years he spent \\"organizing\\" in Chicago 3) His trip to Kenya before law school. Obama is thoughtful, reflective, unsentimental and refreshingly honest. When he wrote the book he was merely 33 and had not accomplished anything particularly exceptional. I found the middle part about his community activities in Chicago flawed. He repeatedly talks about \\"organizing\\" but fails to make the reader understand what he really was doing and how successful he truly was at it. The Chicago section was the longest and by far the dullest. The other 2 parts were a pleasure to read. The Kenya section was also educational .    I was hoping to understand what his feelings were about various political issues. There is absolutely nothing about that in the book. The reader will not learn where he stands on political issues, but will get to know the author and how he thinks. In the preface, an older Obama admits that perhaps the book should have been 50 pages shorter. I think it needed to be much tighter and perhaps was 200 pages too long. The new edition has a copy of his 2004 speech at the Democratic Convention which was my favorite part. He is truly an amazing speaker.

B0013K6WLM|4.0|On some level I agree with other reviewer. I totally understand why the Black Keys made this album. They are trying to move ahead musically but I feel that there are more weak songs on this album than any of their previous albums. Let me start by saying this is not like any other Black Keys albums. It is the Black Keys playing over some light trip-hop beats (provided by Danger Mouse aka the other half of Gnarls Barkley). The truth is that some of the songs on here are awesome and really capture the essence of what the Black Keys are all about (which as I see it is dirty mid fi rock and roll blues). On every Black Keys release until this one I could listen to the songs all the way through without skipping even one track. I love those albums, but this album I only kind of like. I skip a few songs when they come on. The songs I don't skip I love on this album though. If this is your introduction to the Black Keys I would start with one of their earlier albums. If you own all those, don't hesitate to buy this now. Just be aware that this is different than what you've heard before from The Black Keys.
B000002LUB|5.0|I had read negative reviews about this CD, but after purchasing 'The Dio Years'(I listened to Dio cassettes while studying at Miss State in the mid 80's) and hearing the songs from Dehumanizer from that CD, I was perplexed. I went ahead and purchased Dehumanizer, and have now come to the conclusion that those negative reviewers do not understand true hard rock or are from another planet. Dehumanizer is perhaps one of the best metal CD's I have ever heard, and this is what, 16 years later. Dio's vocals are top notch and the instruments are crisp and tight. The late 80's and early 90's (between glam and grunge) produced some very fine rock albums, and this is definitely one of them.

1594489505|3.0|Hosseini's latest novel evokes the tragedy and chaos of an Afghanistan at war with Russia, then itself.  This backdrop is the canvas upon which the lives of Miriam and Laila are revealed.  Both women endure a violent life at the hands of their husband but rest assured the bad guy loses and the good guy (with his girl) rides off into the sunset. If that sound rather formulaic it's because for the most part the story is.  While that doesn't necessarily make it a bad read - in fact I enjoyed the story - it does make it a predictable one.  The novel's popularity may in large part be the result of its accessibility; for the author produces no literary magic, unfurls no rarely used tricks of the trade; he instead snatches the reader from 1060's to post 911 Afghanistan with a linear efficiency that begs to be either finished in one sitting or labored through in many.  Nothing special about it but nothing really bad about it either.

Also the seeking of spirit in stones and more easily flowers. The statement of \\"truth\\" not standing by itself but the inner consciousness being the correct path, The \\"I am\\".  Example: Pg. 57 end of first para. \\"the ultimate truth  of who you are is not I am this or I am that, but I AM\\". So if you believe all truth lies within you (you are God) then you will totally enjoy this book.All of this teaching was popular in many parts of the country even in the early 1980's and before. Also the integration of all religions etc. is far from new. The statements as to what the real meanings of the words of Biblical quotes and inspiration he gained and passes on to us is less than exciting or new. The statement that we are now ready to accept it may be true.  Now the discussion of ego and love have good feelings to them and would tend to bring out the best from us so I can give a single star for effort. But with Opera's blessing I am sure these remarks will be smothered by the landslide that follows after this very nice lady, who I respect for all the good she does.

0805079831|5.0|This book is great. Naomi Klein provides a coherent analysis of various chaotic events in our time pinpointing the role of Milton Friedman and the extreme 'government is bad' ideology coming out of the University of Chicago. The analysis is new, the book is well written, and is both academic and easy to read.     The analysis could be applied to other events not used as case studies in the book, for example, to explain the 'free market' policies we can expect to be imposed by the `post-crisis government' in Zimbabwe, and why the state labor government of New South Wales will struggle to privatise the electricity generation industry in that democratic Australian state.    One of the major cases studies in the book is the war in Iraq.     After reading \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" one can see that the commonly accepted idea that the war in Iraq has been a disaster with its death tolls, unclear outcomes, and wasteful expenditure is wrong - the war has not been a disaster for the constituency that matters, being the civilian contractors who have picked up the big bucks. For them the war has been a great success, whatever you might think.    George Bush was right to declare victory when he did, because by then the victory was won and there was nothing that could affect the flow of money. \\"Mission accomplished, the money is in the bank thanks be to US tax payers, Iraqi oil revenues, and tax payers in other donating countries. We have won. Ha ha ha\\", he might have said.    More broadly, Ms Klein points out that there is a well organised group of financiers, bankers, and contractors poised to make fantastic profits in short periods during and after any period of crisis. These opportunistic storm chasers are also storm seeders, and their ideology has been Friedman's hyper free market mantra that would exclude government from a meaningful social role in the economy.     Klein's thesis is that without a crisis, these Friedmanic policies would never be accepted by a democratic voting public that relies upon the government for the provision of all kinds of social services from education to health etc. With a crisis, manufactured or otherwise, the assistance of the IMF and World Bank and a good deal of suppression it is possible to apply Friedmanic economic shock therapies.     Putting aside the misery, the bloodshed, the torture, the murders, and the blows against democracy that accompanied the crises in South America, Asia, the former eastern bloc, and now Iraq, and looking at the money that has been made by banks, finances houses and certain connected companies and individuals in the aftermath one can see how successful Friedman's flag carriers have been.    Perhaps Friedman himself should be exhumed to declare a victory on their behalf in the ashes of some ruin, shanty town or morgue. \\"The money is in the bank, ha ha ha\\", he might say.    The disturbing thing is that there is no clear end to this business, as the sudden rush of profits that come from fomenting crises and moving in with solutions based on privatising entire industries, dropping corporate tax rates, cutting government expenditure, blasting open new markets, reducing social and environmental regulations, repressing trade unions and social organisations, etc. is addictive.     The storm seeders are well armed, they are well trained, they are well organised and have friends in government, and they may be coming to a neighbourhood near you, particularly if you live in Tehran. Be very careful.    In summary, Naomi Klein is to be congratulated on this book. The ideas are new and cogent, her analysis makes sense and makes sense of the world, and in my humble opinion once you have finished reading \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" you should lend it to a friend or an ideological enemy or donate it to your local high school.
1845767055|5.0|This review is short and to the point:  a beautifully illustrated and constructed book that I will use frequently for reference and ideas!
0452289963|5.0|Excellent book.  I would recommend, however, you read \\"The Power of Now\\" prior to starting this book.
0393061310|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone interested in human history.  The ideas in the book are innovative and thought provoking -- a look at human history that gives new perspective.  Also very important is the suggestion in the Epilogue that a science of human history should be developed to study the issues raised in the book in more detail.  A great idea.<br /><br />The book is very well written -- well organized and easily understandable.  The author uses many contractions that don't often appear in formal writing, but in the context of this book, that less formal style works.<br /><br />The author incorporates many disciplines into the discussion -- anthropology, biology, history.  The concept of available native food groups and available domesticable animals is well presented, with historical examples from all human civilizations.  Whether you ultimately agree with the author's perspective (and I personally think he mostly got it right), the book raises so many interesting issues that it is required reading.
0061120073|5.0|Since reading Betty Smith's classic A Tree Grows in Brooklyn I keep finding myself thinking about little Francie Nolan growing to young womanhood on the streets of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Just like the \\"Heaven Tree\\" that grew up through the concrete, she too struggled against hard, tough elements to reach the sky. For starters, Francie somehow knew that she had to get into another school if she had any hope of improving her life, and her determination led her take the necessary steps...even if it meant faking her address.<br /><br />Although she lived in poverty, Francie had the good fortune of being surrounded by people who loved her, especially her beloved brother Neely and her handsome, charming father. Unfortunately, the latter had a \\"likin' for the bottle\\" which proved to be part of his undoing. Katie Nolan, Francie's mother was a hard working woman who was forced to do more than her fair share of providing for the struggling family, and the scenes describing her diligently cleaning floors while pregnant are unsettling. So is the one in which young Francie is nearly attacked by a child molester until Katie rescues her. There are funny, lovely, and uplifting  passages too...like those of Francie sitting outside to read while absorbing the sights and sounds of the city. The flowers in the library are pleasant to think about and visualize too, lovely reminders that regardless of poverty, pain, and disappointment, there is also beauty.<br /><br />It's a wonderful coming of age book, one that I plan to read again.
0385338724|3.0|This is the third book that Madeleine Wickman (aka Sophie Kinsella) has written under the Kinsella pseudonym, outside of the Shopaholic series.  She published 7 books under her own name from 1995-2001.<br /><br />Each of the three non-Shopaholic books, this one, Can You Keep a Secret and The Undomestic Goddess, concerns a wild premise, where something very unusual has happened.  In this book it is amnesia where the victim has undergone a complete life change between her last memories and the present.  In Can You Keep a Secret, it was a young lady telling her boss, although she doesn't know he's her boss, all her innermost secrets, when she thinks the plane is crashing.  In The Undomestic Goddess, it was a professional lawyer posing as a maid, because of professional malpractice.<br /><br />All three books are entertaining, but the prior two books are more interesting and develop the unusual situations better and more thoroughly.  So, if you like this kind of literature, this book is worth reading.  But if you haven't read the previous two books, Can You Keep a Secret and the Undomestic Goddess, I'd start with those.

B000TNF7NS|5.0|If ever a classic album needed a re-issue then this is it!. Superbly done to enhance and improve this is tremendous. My original review heaped praise on this as a landmark UFO classic and now we have a quality recording to savour with bonus material thrown in. As a life long fan of the classic line up I ordered all three re-issues and have not been disappointed. Buy them all if you can!
0060763280|5.0|The only way to success  or wealth  is the way of 'knowledge how' and not mere 'knowledge that'. The rich people have almost the same practice route which in almost all cases is reversible and which sustains no matter who follows it, provided it is followed as it is or made better. This is what Mr Eker clearly proved in his book.<br /><br />Just as the bible is to Christians because of its detailed information as regards the things to be done to be saved, The secret of the millionaire Mind is the most detailed book I have ever read about the things to be done to be saved from the net of poverty into the ocean of wealth. Another book that has almost the same power is THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON<br /><br />The secret of the millionaire mind is a book everyone who wants to be rich and remain rich has to read and with maximum commitment too. For me, it could be better called the 'business bible'.<br /><br />Just as he was told, I tell all who will read this book that rich people are committed to their engagements.
B000TNF7OC|5.0|The earliest and probably the best buy of the three albums re-issued this year in my humble opinion. This is due to the package of bonus material which you may not have in your collection and which is stronger than the extra bits on \\"Force It\\" and \\"No Heavy Pettin\\". Again the music has not suffered and benefits from a more powerful upto date mix. One of the six must have 70's albums from the classic UFO line up. You won't regret owning another copy!
B0013D8LOK|4.0|Sweeney Todd is one of those musicals that has to change when it makes the transition from stage to screen.  Most notable is that the violence which is mere squirt of blood on stage is going to gush by the gallons on screen.  So in case you're wondering, that's where the R-rating comes in.    But let's not consider the stage version and consider Burton's film version on its own.  It's definitely one of Burton's more ambitious works, being that it is a musical and all.  But he rides with it and the thing is shot beautifully. There are a lot of neat shots, including one early on that zooms through the dark streets of London.  It sets up the ambience beautifully.    Burton's at home with the subject matter as a vengeful barber gives a very fine shave to his customers before they become one of Mrs. Lovett's meat pies.  Depp surprised me as he really captured the menace of Todd and carries much of the feature.  His voice, though not classically trained, is fit for Todd, which ranges from a good singing voice to an angry growl at times.  The expression exalted by Depp, believe it or not, is absent from some professional productions I've seen of the play.    But where Depp succeeds, Helena Bonham Carter fails.  It's not that she doesn't have a great singing voice (though she really doesn't), rather, it's that it's such a flat performance.  Mrs. Lovett is the second lead, and most of the time she's performing, I'd rather not listen.  Her singing voice is very blah.  It's bearable, but in pieces like \\"A Little Priest,\\" the expression is lost - and it's very key to the success of the piece.    Two supporting players that do a tremendous job are Alan Rickman as the judge (can he do any wrong) and the young Ed Sanders as Toby.  The play usually has an older actor play this role.  I never imagined someone the actual age playing the part, but he pulls it off quite well.  There's a scene in the movie where he doesn't even say anything, yet has an expression on his face that wouldmake Damien cringe.    Yet with all the great performances and great look of the production, I couldn't help but feel that something was missing.  And sorry, this is where I have to compare the film to the play.  Sondheim wrote some sneaky little lines into the original that either aren't expressed well in the film or are completely excised from the film.  Their importance was that they added to the dark humor of the piece.  And as gruesome a tale as it is, dark humor was always intended.  It boggles my mind a bit, as it's something Burton's good at, yet some of the humor that immediately follows Todd's \\"Epiphany\\" seems rather lost, making this a rather gruesome musical throughout, which though good, may come off as just a tad too dark.
B00006DEF9|3.0|I have a feeling I am about to step on a few toes, but I just watched this for the first time, and I was less then impressed.<br /><br />The movie revolves around movie stars during the transition from the silent films to the talkies.  Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood.  But when sound comes in, they begin to face problems.  Not only do they have lines to learn, but they have to deal with microphones and other sound imposed technology.  Even worse, Lina has a truly horrid voice.<br /><br />Fortunately for their careers, Don has some help.  His best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) is an able song man, and he turns their latest effort into a musical.  Working behind the scenes, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) dubs Lina's voice.  But will this be enough to save their careers?<br /><br />Now I will be the first to admit that many of the song and dance numbers were great.  The title song is wonderfully sung, the tap dancing of \\"Good Morning\\" was amazing, and Donald O'Connor's performance in \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" made me laugh.<br /><br />But the story that ties all this together is extremely weak.  It was extremely predictable, yet at the same time several major plot points were just kinda dropped in our lap with no explanation.  And don't get me started on the bloated \\"Broadway Melody\\" that takes up 20 minutes near the end.  I never did see the purpose in either movie.  I was bored with it long before it was over.<br /><br />I realize I am in the minority when it comes to this film.  But I do feel the great musical numbers take up so much room the rest of the film isn't given enough time to develop.  Give it a chance if you are interested since so many people love it.  But personally, I will be steering clear of it in the future.

0743268091|5.0|While I truly enjoyed The End of Faith, it pales in intellectual clarity when compared to David Eller's Natural Atheism. While Mr. Eller's book isn't as easy to read, it is infinitely more relevant for our time. Read Natural Atheism and you won't need to spend (waste) any more time discussing childish religious precepts, concepts, and superstitions.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|Wow, what a spectacular film!  The scene where the British Army assaults the French line during the Seven Year's War, with fifes and drums playing and flags flying, is unbelievably well-done, especially with regards to costuming, location, and casting.  The plodding musical background that weaves throughout the movie keeps it more grim than lighthearted... a nice departure from most historical adventure films.  The duel near the end of the movie (I won't say between whom) is almost painstaking in it's very precise dialog and ominous, drawn-out score!  A real masterpiece, this film is.
006145785X|5.0|If you do not stop and think after reading this book, you are deep in the fog.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|I first should disclose that I have a strong respect for Tinto Brass and Malcolm McDowell.  Brass has directed a significant number of beautiful and playful Euro-teaser films which are very fun and light, and which are educational to us stodgy Americans who sometimes need some guidance in the art of loosening up.  I have seen most of his movies and have loved them.  Meanwhile, McDowell is a certified genius. Clockwork Orange proved that, and this movie furthers that impression. He possesses a strange and strong mettle, and with those piercing cold blue eyes he is the demon-freak to which other actors can only aspire.  Add to this mix: Gore Vidal, who is really not my cup of tea for a couple of reasons, but who is admittedly a high-order intellect; Peter O'Toole, in fine form here; and Bob Guccione, who had, in his prime, fabulous sensibilities as to what is sexy in a woman.  Finally, add in Caligula himself. You now have the synergistic recipe for a cinematic masterpiece which will endure for generations. Endure? No, actually it will appreciate, it will increase in value over the years. Bold, unprecedented works enjoy that reward from time.    That is exactly what these gentlemen built here.  This movie is so shock-rich and taboo-dense that I think it takes considerable time to assimilate it. It needs time to ferment in your psyche.  When I first saw it ten years ago I was a little shocked and confused by the madness and mayhem.  This time around (last night) I was instead stupefied by all the dream-like beautiful sets, the dynamic performance by Mr. McDowell  (seriously: this guy deserved an Academy Award here), all the scrumptuous females, the haunting music, Tinto Brass's elegant photography.....and much, much more.    Yes, this movie is clearly not for persons under 18, (or preferably under 21 in my opinion), or for people with prudish predilections.  But if you can open your mind to some vivid, and sometimes ugly, displays of outrageous vaingloriousness, you are in for a real treat. The depictions of cruelty are not pretty, but they only highlight the arrays of lavish beauty by way of contrast.  This movie is Kubrickian in scope and haunting mood. I loved it.  Let's not make it more complicated than it really is: It is a Celluloid Masterpiece, with some parts which are hard to watch.  In the end, we are amply rewarded, as this is a film about history, and of historical stature in its own right.
B00104QSOM|1.0|I watched this movie twice. The first time I could barely get thru it.<br /><br />The second time was no better. Such poor acting and the music...and I do use that term lightly, was enough to make me want to gouge out my own ear drums.<br /><br />I so rarely give movies one star, but I this one I wish I could give even less than that.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this to attach to a Peg Perego Centro Completo Stroller that only came with one, woefully inadequate cup holder.  The Buggy Buddy attaches easily to the stroller, and can accomodate a 24 oz water bottle, without feeling tippy.  We haven't given it the ultimate Starbucks test yet, but the cupholders look roomy enough to handle a venti.  It has a nice zippered mesh pocket for holding credit card, drivers licence, keys, etc. and a generous area between the cup holders for other necessities. We have been using it a couple of weeks, now, and so far so good.  A big thumbs up on this one!
1416550518|5.0|This book kept me in suspense all the way through I enjoyed the visuals the author gave us as well as the characters.   Very well written novel of a fascinating time in history when women were breaking free of their restrictions to the household as the wife, sister or daughter but were finally begining to make a life for themselves instead of having others decide for them.  I enjoyed the narrator of Grace her history as well as that of Emmeline and Hannah was so well crafted and intertwined it was a facinating to read how each woman dealt with the changes in their worlds, tragic too.  I'm looking forward to more of Kate Morton's books I hope they have as well crafted and interesting characters as this one did.  Well Done!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|The premise of the movie is interesting. A Liverpool ship worker named Jude (Jim Sturgess)goes to the United States during the 1960's to find the father he never knew. He meets up with Max (Joe Anderson) at the college Jude's father works at and they become friends. Jude then falls for Max's sister Lucy while Max gets shipped to Vietnam and Lucy joins the cause as well.<br /><br />What makes the movie extraordinary are the Beatles songs that are interwoven into the story and the way that the characters sing them (especially Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson.)<br /><br />A very powerful movie whose music will stick with you long after you see it.
0553573411|4.0|First of all: the cover-art on this particular edition looks embarassingly ridiculous, but don't let it fool you. This novel, and the whole trilogy, are genuinely well-written: full of detail but never bloated or tedious, and never boring. This second installment in the Farseer Trilogy is a deeply absorbing read. As I wrote in my review of the first book in this triology, the magic in Hobb's world is subtle and very believable. This is not a corny Tolkein knock-off, none of the usual fantasy cliches. It's suspenseful and engrossing. The characters are memorable, distinctive, and sympathetic, and none of them seem unnecessary.      Be aware, though: this is not a \\"light\\" story. The hero undergoes a lot of emotional and physical pain, and a lot of tragedy. In fact, the hardships and the downbeat stuff can seem repetitive or melodramatic, after a while. Yet, somehow, this story does not strike me as depressing or excessively dark. It did not make me too sad, though I wished Fitz would eventually have better luck.      Also, be aware that there are some very violent moments. The violence is always relevant to the story, but I still think the author could have toned it down a bit, while still getting her point across.
B000OV170W|5.0|i loved the book, I even cried at the end, even though I thought it was far too strongly forshadowed. I have an objection to the claim that it addressed the issue but failed to resolve it: I don't think that was the intent. I found the book gripping and realistic.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I have to say I really enjoyed Cloverfield. Going into the film I had a big concern that you wouldn't get to see what brought such disaster to NYC. Thankfully you did get to see a decent amount of the creature by time the film ended. And you have to love that you weren't watching something that looked like godzilla. Instead of a laughable giant toy you get a really strange looking beast that tears apart anything in its' path.<br /><br />The story follows a guy who will be leaving for Japan and some of his freinds. They throw him a good luck suprise party when you get a little background on the characters up until the lights going out with a loud noise to follow. As they run out into the chaotic city streets they see the Statue of Liberty's come crashing down while catching a quick glimpse of the giant creature in between a couple skyskrapers. As the story continues you follow four of the characters as they do anything they can to survive and save a fellow friend trapped in their destroyed building.<br /><br />Overall I say this one deserves 4 stars. I thought for a low budget film they did a tremendous job making it seem as if NYC was in ruins. All the creature action was exciting, very well done and truley terrifying at times. Just the thought of that situation actually happening will give you some chills. Despite the complaints regarding the camera it really isn't that bad. After 10 mins you get completely used to it and should enjoy the show.
B000W1V5VU|3.0|How Does it Look?<br /><br />Color tint changes, split-screen effects, and other aesthetic effects are employed in this movie, making a standalone judgement of picture quality difficult.<br /><br />However, there were a few instances of edge enhancement that were noticeable, but not to a degree where it distracted from the movie in a major way. Considering the type of movie that this is (a crime caper, not an epic), the issues are barely worth mentioning because they do not impact enjoyment of the movie.<br /><br />How Does it Sound?<br /><br />This is primarily a talking movie, so it's not surprising that the center channel gets all the action and the rest aren't used much at all. It is disappointing in a way, though, as Las Vegas is one of the most dynamic environments created by man, and the casino scenes are notably lacking in any ambience.<br /><br />The tremor scene was mildly realistic by lighting up the subwoofer a little, but this is another instance where doing it any better would have stood out when the rest of the movie is so center-heavy.<br /><br />Extras<br /><br />I like to see the theatrical trailer included with movies, so I'm disappointed that they omitted one on this DVD. Considering that the up-front ads included no less than four trailers/ads for other movies, it would have been nice had Warner provided us with one that was connected with the movie on the disc.<br /><br />What we have been given is a feature on what designers in Las Vegas do to influence visitors called Vegas: An Opulent Illusion. It's interesting, but nothing that we haven't been exposed to in other documentaries about Sin City. Much less interesting is the other short video, Jerry Weintraub Walk and Talk. Weintraub looks uncomfortable to be doing it, and he doesn't really provide much insight beyond the fact that most of the props used in the casino are fully operational. The Additional Scenes are largely forgettable, and add nothing to the movie. They serve as a testament tothe skill of the Editor, but not much else.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first two movies, you will enjoy this one. It's definitely the weakest of the bunch, but probably better than a lot of other movies out there. It's disappointing to see so few interesting extras, which makes one believe that a special edition is coming down the line at some point that will include extras that have already been offered online. This isn't sold as a Special Edition, and the street price on this disc is low, so perhaps it's difficult to complain about the lack of decent extras. Still, I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you are a big fan and want to complete your set of the previous movies. It's well worth the rental, though.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie blew me away.  Yes, I am a committed Beatles fan, so go figure that I loved \\"Across the Universe.\\"  The anti-war message is every bit as relevant today as during the movie's setting, so time frames seem superfluous.  The classic, \\"I Want You,\\" no longer expresses the unconsummated, romantic pinings of the Fab Four, but takes on a darker association with Uncle Sam's recruitment and drafting.<br /><br />I can't praise the gorgeous and ingenious arrangements enough.  Elliot Goldenthal deserves THE OSCAR (nevermind mere Oscar considerations) for this musical. He twists and turns familiar tunes, honing new territory, as he explores and exploits (in the good sense of the word) modulations, instrumentation, and harmonies.<br /><br />(The young man who played Maxwell---despite this character's name, we were thankfully spared one of the few duds of the Beatles's oeuvre---looks uncannily like Kurt Cobain, from the coloring, angular features, to the facial stubble.)<br /><br />My one gripe about the film (which my brother and sister-in-law were forced to listen to me go on about after we had finished watching the movie) was the treatment of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\\"  The name of the female protagonist sets us up for some pretty hefty expectations of what Goldenthal would do with this song.  I was more than a little disappointed when this song was relocated to the closing credits with Bono's cover (duh, use a reprise of \\"Across the Universe\\" for the closing credits). Jude and the rest of the cast were primed to serenade \\"the girl with kaleidoscope eyes\\" during the actual movie, not as an afterthought during the closing credits.  I thought some intricate rendition of \\"Lucy\\" with Jude singing lead vocals would have been an appropriate ending to the movie, signalling the reconciliation and long-term commitment of this relationship.  As it turned out, I thought that this otherwise outstanding and creative movie ended too abruptly.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the \\"Lucy in the Sky\\" fiasco (okay, admittedly a harsh word choice), this is one of the most imaginative and stimulating movies I've EVER seen.kay, admittedly a harsh word choice), this is one of the most imaginative and stimulating movies I've EVER seen.
B00005JOHC|5.0|Want to laugh? buy this dvd set. A guranteed good time over and over. Despite buying this set months ago, we watch it whenever there is nothing funny on tv. Pop up some pocorn and enjoy. NB. some of the humor is inappropriate for the younger set...but most of that goes over their heads.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Ok, so I started watching Supernatural because I was looking for a fun genre show to replace Buffy, Angel et al after they'd finished.  The pilot epi of Supernatural was good, but the next few were only ok, and I was thinking of ditching it.  I'm so glad I didn't because about 1/3 of the way through the first season, it suddenly grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  This is true excellence in television - frightening, suspenseful, funny, harrowing, and moving - every episode is like a mini-movie.  There are few horror films/shows that have made me cry the Faith did when Dean has his massive heart attack, or hide behind my hands like Home did during the infamous \\"garbage disposal and monkey\\" scene.      I'd never seen either Jared Padelecki or Jensen Ackles in anything before Supernatural, but those two only get better and better as the show progresses - in a way, it's like they were born to play Sam and Dean, they inhabit their characters so well.  Ackles nails Dean's cocky swagger and the pain that belies his tough exterior so effectively that it's hard to believe that he's acting.  And Jared Padalecki grows so much throughout the first and second seasons that it's a joy to watch - Sam's gentle nature is complemented by a surprising steel on the inside.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan is perfect as the father who did the best he could after the horrific events of the pilot - he's simultaneously sympathetic and infuriating for the way he deals with his boys.      In general, I can't recommend Supernatural more highly - the second season is even better and the third (probably the most frightening of the three), though cut short by the strike, has proven that everyone working on Supernatural is intent on creating hilarious, terrifying and heartwrenching television.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|1st of all, let me say that this film is not a \\"bring me up whe i;m down\\" film.  It is very dark, very sad, extremely depressing...BUT, one of the most well made films i have ever seen.  The acting, the direction, the climax, and (i guess you can call it a) resolution...all of it was absolutly flawless...  2nd of all  I have read a lot of reviews of the film...and a lot of people seem to think that the movie is about drug addiction...  it in fact is not.  The film is about the addiction to what makes a human happy, whether it be a tv show, drugs, girls, family...everything and anything that can make a person feel good about themselves and \\"give them a reason to get up in the morning\\".  It is about the desperation to hold on to a dream of happiness, even when, in reality, there is no hope.    This, as well as the film Pi, is a very good example of how films should be made.  I recommend that if you plan to whatch or purchase this film...pay the few extra dollars to get the two-in-one set that comes with Pi and the uncut version of Requiem.    Enjoy
B000059GEI|4.0|This is a mind-boggling \\"theater\\" movie, a sort of \\"Ozzie and Harriet\\" on steroids. The movie dives right into the  life and times of \\"the Donahues\\" -- the show biz family to end all show biz families. It's unintentionally hysterical, shocking, wild, big, bizarre... for me it really ran straight down the list of adjectives from Capital \\"A!\\" to triple ZZZ! Everything big, bright, fizzy, funny, fine!<br /><br />First: I never really appreciated Marilyn Monroe till I saw her in this movie. She was (perhaps is) the hottest woman on earth! In her \\"Heat Wave\\" song she suddenly kisses one of the dancers. It didn't seem choreographed. It was incredibly hot. The woman was all curves, an endless flowing river of sensuality. Sorry, Madonna, you are a pale, poor imitation. Marilyn had the goods: the looks, the voice, the sex appeal. She is so much fun just to watch. \\"Heat Wave\\" must have been conceived after someone ingested heavy drugs and washed them down with Jamaican rum.<br /><br />Ethel Merman was the original Bette Midler. Big, brassy, ballsy. Every song has to be big, giant, pounding, loud! She's just so much fun to watch. Some of her costumes are eyeball shattering.

What a concept!<br /><br />Donald O'Connor was such a fabu dancer -- they do this whole \\"fountain\\" number, obviously in an attempt to recreate \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" -- Don was such a pleasure to watch and he and Marilyn have one sizzling kiss.

Mr. Vaudeville. The man had to do it all -- Mr. Show Biz Dad! He taps, he sings, he acts, he cries. Wow!<br /><br />His best moment is when he \\"returns\\" from looking for Don (after a year)... wearin' the same ol' hat, coat and tie that he left home in!<br /><br />And then... the final number! How much bigger could they make it!  If they could have only shot it like they shoot music videos today, it would have been a defining moment in musical movies.<br /><br />Three things to note that I found bizarre: Marilyn sings \\"Lazy\\" -- a pointless waste of time song that did not benefit her, Donald or Mitzi. When she sang it, she kept pronouncing the \\"zee\\" as \\"gi\\" as in \\"Gigi.\\" Why? Who the hell knows.<br /><br />Then, Johnnie Ray, who only seemed to come alive when he sang: His song \\"I Believe\\" was questionable at best, and his performance is from some other solar system.

It was clear to ME why he decided to do it, but what was the point for the film?<br /><br />Anyway, it's all a big barrel of everything that could be stuffed into it, but finally, just to see Ethel sing \\"There's No Business...\\" is somethin' to behold.<br /><br />Altogether, a wild, wild insane ride.

B0006D6LDG|5.0|There are very few movies (or books) available to the true Christian believer that demonstrate the life of taking up your cross and following Christ daily.  Of dying to self - so that it is no longer about you but only Christ.  THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BOOKS that will be of benefit to you if you long to submit to Him - NOT THE RITUALS, NOT RELIGION - but the life that is no longer YOU - the death of YOU, of self, of vanity, of pride - of coming out from among the world and being separate.  And even though the main character struggles with obedience, there is a deeper depth (for truly she is rejecting RELIGION AND RITUALS and NOT CHRIST).  It is also a powerful testimony of living your life for Him no matter what - including disappointment; of finding that what HE CHOOSES is best and not that which we could ever dream up for ourselves.  A MUST SEE MOVIE.  WELL DONE.  You won't be disappointed if you truly long for Christ, to live in His perfect will.  THE MOVIE IS JUST AS GOOD - ALSO A MUST SEE!

B000002IAZ|5.0|Buffalo Springfield was neither the first vehicle for nor the first group to record and release works by founding members Richie Furay, Stephen Stills, and Neil Young.  Rather, it was a sounding board and a starting point for a new direction in rock and the beginning of stardom for its aforementioned members (and even later, Jim Messina of Loggins and Messina fame).  Stephen Stills would emerge as the group's main songwriter but, as with Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, he would soon be surpassed for quality of work by peer and colleague Neil Young.  The dynamics between the two are simultaneously famous and infamous, yet the mutual admiration and inspiration is evident on this and all future Stills-Young projects.    Emerging at a time when The Beatles had led the British rock brigade into America, and the US had replied with the Dylan-inspired folk rock of The Byrds and The Mamas and The Papas, The Buffalo Springfield would introduce more of a country flavor to the spectrum (a la The Band, latter-day Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and The Flying Burrito Brothers).  Like The Band, Springfield would include both Americans and Canadians, just as CSNY would add an Englishman and former Hollie to the mix.  Not necessarily making this a melting pot, it does bring to the fore different cultural elements and an innovative blend of ideas.    This release serves as an appropriate crash course to the form, both in its advantages and disadvantages, and as an excellent introduction to the musical careers of Stephen Stills and Neil Young (Furay's light not shining quite as brightly even though he would achieve some standard of success with Poco).  As the saying goes, \\"the best is yet to come!\\"

B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars is a clever detective series following the title character as she navigates the emotional mines of high school while trying to solve assorted crimes (think a cross between Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Encyclopedia Brown).    It is an engaging show. Like BtVS, Mars is almost *too* clever at times, and the show almost crosses from being hip to being trendy, but by mid-season the show knows exactly what it's doing and doesn't look back.    Running through the season is a strong plotline wherein Veronica tries to solve the murder of a friend of hers (and thereby restore her discredited father's reputation). The last few episodes are filled with revelations, and the finale is an absolute thriller.    The regular cast is excellent, especially the father (Enrico Colantoni) and social-nemesis Logan (Jason Dohring) who winds up practically stealing the show. True to its chic-nature, there's also some inspired stunt casting throughout the series, including in this first season Paris Hilton and Alyson Hannigan.    All-in-all, Veronica Mars is a top notch program. While it hasn't found its voice through the first several episodes, it is, by mid-season, a tightly-written, splendidly-acted thrill ride.    Five stars.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Johnny Cash is undoubtedly as essential to American music as Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, and Hank Williams.  His contributions are admired by both country aficionados and rockers alike.  On none of his releases is the reason why as apparent as with his \\"Live At San Quentin\\" release.    Here, we're treated to rousing renditions of early Cash classics \\"Big River,\\" \\"I Still Miss Somone,\\" and \\"I Walk The Line\\" alongside revamped versions of \\"Folsom Prison Blues,\\" \\"Ring Of Fire,\\" and \\"Wreck Of The Old 97.\\"  Needless to say, the addition of Carl Perkins to the list of backing musicians has a great deal to do with the musical quality of this show!  However, the musical highlights don't stop there:    At San Quentin, Cash introduces new numbers / soon to be hits such as \\"A Boy Named Sue\\" and \\"Jackson,\\" as well as the biting \\"San Quentin\\" and \\"Starkville City Jail.\\"  On the double-disc boxed set, Cash also welcomes upcoming act The Statler Brothers and bluegrass favorites The Carter Family (now consisting of Mother Maybelle and her daughters).  No longer limited to merely country or gospel numbers, modern era folk and rock covers include the eclectic and often-covered \\"Break My Mind,\\" the Lovin' Spoonful's \\"Darlin' Companion,\\" Tom Paxton's \\"The Last Thing On My Mind,\\" and Carl Perkins' classic \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" (performed by the master himself)!    Cash's passing would leave an empty space in American music, but the legacy of recordings he left behind and the artists he inspired (and continues to inspire) will deservedly live on as a true American treasure.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Veronica Mars' sophomore effort (or, according to the series, her senior one) is excellent, if it doesn't quite achieve the heights of the first season.    It has a lot to live up to, after all, and the resolution of the bus accident just doesn't have the same punch as finding out who killed Lilly Kane. Also, we've moved past the unexplored romantic tensions between Veronica and Logan that provided so much kick to the mid-to-late parts of the first season, and are stuck instead in a bizarre love pentagon with Veronica, Logan, Meg, Duncan and Kendall.    Some characters, so central to the series initially, leave for a while and sometimes come back (and sometimes, not). While the final few episodes find a spark, again, and provide worthy thrills and chills, it isn't as fulfilling or meaningful as the season that came before it.    Not that this is a crime. The Second Season of Veronica Mars is still well-written, and beautifully acted by most of its regulars. The emergence of \\"Beaver\\" as a main character and his fledgling romance with always-endearing Mac is one of the highlights, as is the continued stunt-casting brilliance, finding roles (among others) for Kevin Smith and Joss Whedon.    On the whole, Veronica Mars is one of the recent bright spots in all of television, and these episodes are no exception to that. A four-and-a-half star season from a five star show: rounds up to five.

0143038419|4.0|I find it so surprising--reading the angry, negative reviews--that the people who hated the book hated it for exactly the reasons why some steer clear away from the the spiritual-journey-memoir genre. Yes, the author is self-absorbed, yes, she seems to think of only trite stuff, yes, she seems self-indulgent with her problems. And yes, she's allowed. It is after all a book that is positioned to address these things in the author's self; who otherwise would not be searching for something more: more meaning and more appreciation in/of her life.   Here is a woman who shows all the possibly-perceived-as-lacking-substance thoughts of hers and we are throwing tomatoes at her. One thing, she obviously wasn't afraid of that. She wasn't aiming to be coming off as some deeply wise woman but a fumbling girl-woman trying to break out of what she felt was imminent disaster (had she had the baby and delayed her need to find out what she truly wants from her life she might have left not only her husband, but their child, or most probably ending up not leaving out of guilt and becoming crazy instead: exposing her family to that for years; not an uncommon reality). She is not one for anti-depressants, remember.  This memoir falls in the same category as the TV show Sex and the City (of which it was compared to in a review here). Both get trampled for being supposedly superficial, covering the silly plights of city girls who don't know what they want and yet have everything. But this book--as the TV show--actually are part of a wider story that is illiciting reactions from the public because it reflects the transition in which women in the modern world are experiencing: now that we have equality with men professionally, now that we are liberated from all the limitations being a woman dictated two generations ago, how does that affect us? From a distance, in a glance, it seems that women have all the cards to play with now. But this book and many other works by women and/or about women of this generation show that having all those cards does not mean Happiness.   There are still things in society--in regards to a woman's role--that grates. And then there are things within our Modernised, Westernized, Individualized, Ambitious selves, that are lacking.   This is what Miss Gilbert's search is about, and what she represents.  On a collective level, much of the modern world is in search of God, Spirituality (one just needs to walk through bookstores in the US and see the plethora of soul searching self help books on the shelves). This is what needs to be observed and understood as a phenomena in the West; the small voices, small cries, here and there by those who come up with the balls to share their journeys and thoughts with us--no matter how trite-sounding, how shallow-seeming--are part of a collective howl for the meaning of life.  Elizabeth Gilbert's voice is just one of many that calls for recognition as part of a chorus for something that firstly, many women are hollering about, and secondly, humanity in general--humanity in the first world--are crying for: some kind of guidance, indication, that the collective paths we fought for and chose (the best education, career ambitions realised, a certain amount of money needed to live that certain kind of magazine-lifestyle life--which is what Liz Gilbert's life is a reflection of, remember--love in the form of marriage and what society dictates) are truly the things that give us peace and happiness in the infinite sense.  Eat, Pray, Love might not be that deep, wise voice representing the deep, wise journey into the deep, wise self. But this book's packaging and tone, hell, its WORDS, never did say it was. It is a fumbling--almost child-like in its guilelessness--show of the ego's awareness and needs, and its attempt at searching for what many people from all walks of life only wish they could go out and find: THEMSELVES. SELF, being the keyword here. And in this memoir, ultimately, God, being in each of our selves.  To the people who were disappointed that the author didn't seem to give a hoot about India's poverty, they must have not read the book through: Miss Gilbert never ventured out of her ashram and the little village it is located in, after making a decision to further develop her meditation skills and thus skipping the rest of India. She also ignored Italy's corruption with her indulging in good food and focus on learning and enjoying the Italian language. Again, the critics missed the  point of this memoir. It's a book about a writer, a New Yorker, a recently-divorced-woman-in-her-early-thirties' journey to heal and find spiritual strength through various means: pleasure first to recover (Italy), spiritual examination and purging (India), combining the two for balance (Bali), which would result hopefully in the kind of substance and depth and balance that so many critics mentioned she lacks.   One doesn't pick this book up to: 1. Be exposed to India's poverty and expect the author to discuss that in depth. 2. Be exposed to Italy's corruption and expect the author to discuss that in depth. 3. Be exposed to Balinese wiles and expect the author to discuss that in depth. (which she actually did in the account of the Balinese woman she raised money for to buy the land the woman needed to build a home).    Next time you pick a book up at the bookstore, call up your powers of perception before purchasing it. A book IS pretty much its cover. Did everyone really expect a book titled \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" A Woman's Search for Everything, to be an experience of religious fervor, one that would reveal the secrets of the universe? It's a story about a girl who thought everything she thought she wanted, would bring her happiness. It didn't. It didn't for her, and possibly not for many other women. If it took this one woman to go to Italy, India, and Indonesia, to get away after a difficult and painful divorce to heal and get perspective--instead of festering  and turning into a pile of flesh in depression--then by all means. Yes, she financed her travels through her book advance--after giving away the suburban home and NYC apartment to her ex-husband. And if she wrote this book for us, it's really for us to appreciate and enjoy the ride with her. Anybody else who got so upset needed only to put the book down and pick another one to their taste. If anything, that's this book's lesson: Do what makes you smile and thankful for life.
B0012219RS|2.0|After watching the DVD I knew this is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  In my rush for instant gratification I skipped the wait for a CD and downloaded the album.  While the clarity itself isn't an issue, the files are full of skips and glitches.  They aren't a RAM issue as they occur at the same place regardless of what other work my system is doing.  I don't know if this is a file problem, a server problem or what, but if I could I would totally ask for my money back as it is basically impossible to listen without being distracted.    On the plus side, amazon's support center was ridiculously fast and helpful with getting me around my work's content filter...

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|After the last album, 2004's \\"Around the Sun\\", I have to admit I had given up on REM as that album marked the lowest and most disappointing point yet in their rich and illustrious career yet. When word came out last year that REM was yet again prepping a new album to be released in 2008, I kinda rolled my eyes. Then a funny thing happened: I heard the first single \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" and boy that song just rocked! Now comes the new album.<br /><br />On \\"Accelerate\\" (11 tracks; 35 min.) REM attacks with a vigor not heard since \\"Monster\\" and \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\" (the last album with original drummer Bill Berry). From the opening sounds of \\"Living Well's the Best Revenge\\", REM sounds completely reinvigorated and rejuvenated, and what a joy it is to hear. The album goes from one highlight to the next. The songs are short and to the point, they make their point and move on. Track 4 \\"Hollow Man\\" is when you think you'll catch your breath, and you do for about 15 seconds, before that songs also crashes in to your speakers. \\"Houston\\" follows and is the only weak track on the album, in my opinion. The second half kicks off with the rousing title track, and we're off to the races again: \\"Until the Day Is Done\\" and \\"Mr Richards\\" are superb. \\"Horse to Water\\" is one of my favorites with an irresistible sing-along chorus of \\"I'm not that easy/I am not your horse to water/I hold my breath I come around\\")  sing-along, and \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\" is a killer track to close this set (with such choice lines of \\"Death is pretty final/I'm collecting vinyl/I'm gonna DJ at the end of the world\\"). It truly is remarkable that some how REM has rediscovered its musical focus and muse. Peter Buck's guitar work is among the best he's ever done, Stipe sounds like he's actually enjoying the songs, and Mills' harmonizing back vocals are really great (check out \\"Living Well\\", for example, but surely some credit of this resurgence must go to producer Jacknife Lee.<br /><br />I can't emphasize enough how pleasantly surprised I am by this album, even shocked. I truly didn't think that REM had another great album in them, but I am more than happy to say that I was flat wrong and in my book \\"Accelerate\\" brings REM back to relevance, after so many disappointing years. I had the opportunity to see REM headline the Langerado Music Festival in early March in South Florida, and they play a bunch of songs from \\"Accelerate\\", and it all sounded fantastic. Welcome back REM, we've missed ya! \\"Accelerate\\" is one of the early favorites for top album of the year. Highly recommended!antly surprised I am by this album, even shocked.

B0012K1ILW|5.0|of what is and what could be on \\"New AmErykah.\\"  After listening to it a couple of times, I get what she's saying.  As someone mentioned, it is the \\"wake up\\" call for 2008.  And while it may not be the masterpiece (Mama's Gun, hands down), it is an important work.  It flows, it's smart, it's on the edge.  I haven't heard something like this, where the artist is making a statement on a whole project, since listening to Gil-Scott Heron, KRS-ONE and Public Enemy(some of my favorites).  And definitely not from a female vocalist.  \\"Honey\\" had to be the first single, to get people to listen; it's smooth, funky, accessible.  After you listen, it's up to you as to where you'll allow Erykah to take you with her vision on this project.  As for myself, I'll be in the crowd, paying attention to one of the most important artist we have now.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|This is it. This really is the one: the killer comeback R.E.M.'s long-suffering original fans have been hoping for since the band detoured into electronic introspection in 1998. Peter Buck's guitars are front and centre, driving the tracks rather than decorating their edges. Mike Mills can finally be heard again on bass and backups. Stipe's vocals are as rich and complex and scathing as ever, but for the first time in a decade he sounds like he believes every word. And finally, at long last, it feels like a human being is manning the drums again. It's exuberant, angry, joyous, wild - everything the last three albums, for all their deep and subtle rewards, were not. Superficially, this feels like the true successor to \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\", or what that album itself might have been had the band bunkered down in the studio for a month rather than putting down tracks on the road. But in reality it's better. Ten years of studio-based experimentation and tweaking a new line-up have paid off. Tight, rich and consummately professional, the immediate loose-and-live feel of \\"Accelerate\\" is deceptive. This really is an exquisitely crafted album that repays close listening, just as the last three did for those of us who bothered. The crucial difference is that it ultimately feels less studied, less worried-over, less cautious - because it doesn't need to be. The band sound present, engaged, completely confident in their direction and abilities. Best of all, they sound like they're enjoying themselves again. And that joy is irresistible. No matter what your view of the last three albums (I liked them all), you've got nothing to complain about here. This kind of music really is what R.E.M. do best, and they deliver it in spades.<br /><br />(P.S. Make sure you grab the non-album track \\"Redhead Walking\\" from iTunes: a great novelty song and surely destined for a Tarantino film soundtrack.)

0743289412|3.0|For about the last 25 years, Stephen King has been my favorite author.  Usually, I devour his books within a week or so of their release.  This one though, was a real struggle to get through.  Not because it was a bad story or an unoriginal plot, but simply because there is SO much material in here that just doesn't add to the story.    Now, I am solidly in the school that more King is a good thing.  After all, the unabridged version of \\"The Stand\\" is one of the best books ever.  But the \\"more is more\\" philosophy just doesn't work here.  In fact, I found myself liking Scott (one of the main characters) less with every word.  And the sort of cutesy expressions King has Scott use in talking about his childhood get downright grating at times.    That said, when something is actually happening, the book gets quite good, and there are substantial chunks which are right up there with King's past page-turners.  It's just that there is simply too much backstory here.  Ironically, in the end notes, King jokes about how his editor really wanted to make this book shorter, but he just couldn't bear to take the advice.  In this case, unfortunately, I think the editor was right.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|This film has a dream cast with Gwyneth Paltrow playing the elegant rich girl Emma, getting into trouble with her foolish over-romantic meddling in the affairs of others. Jeremy Northam is reserved, wise, and handsome as Mr. Knightly, Emma's sister's brother-in-law who is also a neighbor of the Woodhouse family. Toni Collette plays a big-boned Harriet Smith, the village maid that eventually finds the right man. Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax and Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill play the secret lovers who eventually marry when the young Mr. Churchill inherits enough funds to marry a poor but beautiful, reserved, and talented governess. Greta Scacchi plays Frank Churchill's mother, Mrs. Weston and hats off to Sophie Thompson who plays the silly chatterbox Miss Bates. All the actors are superb but it is actually Toni Collette who steals every scene playing the overly impressionable Miss Harriett Smith.     Jane Austen's Emma has always been a favorite of mine.  It is as close to comedy as any of Austen's work. It is basically about a rich beautiful witty and immature young woman who begins to grow up after her endless schemes back-fire and she almost misses a man who adores her. This differs from Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility where the women are not rich and thus marriage to a well situated male makes all the difference in the world in regard to life's trajectory. Late 18th century women in England had to rely on marriage as the prime determination of their social class and fiscal stability. Thus the play between men and women has an edge of economic competition in Austen's more mature works than is evident in Emma. Emma is about maturity and developing character whereas Elizabeth Barrett in Pride and Prejudice already has a high level of character and maturity even as the story begins. Even though Harold Bloom, the literary critic, selects Emma as the best of Austen's work, I find I disagree. This film is beautiful and graceful and funny, exactly as Emmashould be produced. However it is Pride and Prejudice which is the masterpiece. This however does not distract from this charming and well produced interpretation of Austen's Emma.
B00008IHN1|5.0|Drumline was one of the best movies I can recall seeing in 2002. Nick Cannon in his first starring role carrys this movie very well. I took the film for what it was a crowd pleasing movie that makes you root for the underdog. Charles Stone III who directed the very good Paid In Full before this shows he can tell a good story. Zoe Salidana and Orlando Jones also give great performances. I paid to see this film twice and always give repeat viewings on DVD.

B000031WD9|5.0|When this film was first released in the summer of 1999, it was so hilarious that I almost fell out laughing. It's a film everyone can relate when it comes to your first time. Jason Biggs show great comedic genius, but every guy knows that the bedroom scene is the best scene and it's a shame Shannon Elizabeth hasn't showed off her goods again.
B00132D808|4.0|I felt the need to come to the aid of this album...  It seems a lot of people are bashing the album because it's \\"not like the first one\\".  True, it is not, but it's different in a good way.  It's more laid back and \\"musicy\\" and less techno rock like the first one.  I loved the first album, but I'm open to a new direction and this pulls it off nicely.  I even like the country song!
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Live Free or Die Hard (Unrated Edition) is one hell of a fun ride and features all the gritty action from the first three films plus one liners and all the action you can stand !
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Cyberpunk dystopia, existential splendor, postmodern alienation! The final cut of Blade Runner revitalizes a vivid portrayal of urban decay, racial subjugation, and technology at its worst.  Although it may lack the traditional themes of film noir, the mood and atmosphere is there. There is an unsettling resemblance between the world we currently live in, over two decades after the movie's release, and Ridley Scott's dark vision of a future where technology, capitalism, and genetic engineering go awry.  I rank this as one of the greats of science fiction, next to Solyaris, Metropolis, and 2001.
B000053VAF|5.0|Dogma was Kevin Smith's best film until Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. The film did recieve bad press for being constervtial but I don't think it is. These are Smith's beliefs just as The Passion Of The Christ was Mel Gibson's.If you haven't seen it yet check it out. The way Smith just connects his movies is pure genius It's the fourth film in Kevin Smith's intricately interconnected View Askewniverse series (the others being Clerks. (1994), Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) and Clerks II (2006)). The movies are all linked by characters, themes and events and each contains numerous references to the others. The DVD also have GOOD deleted and not crappy ones like most movies.
B0010ZR160|5.0|This film was a real treat, with at least three extra phases of complexity and mystery beyond where I expected to end.<br /><br />More to the point, it held my 13-year-old's attention completely, to the point of pausing it when he wanted to go to the bathroom or get ice cream or whatever.  [Note: lots of four letter words in the first half of the movie, this can freak out the super-strict, but if you believe in helping kids understand reality beyond their sterile little world in the suberbs, I personally believe this movie is outstanding on multiple levels and for multiple purposes.<br /><br />Others have reviewed the details--for me, it's enough to justify the five star rating (beyond the obvious merit of the proven actors and actresses) by simply saying, any film that can hold my 55-year-old *very* demanding attention, and my 13-year-old's rapt attention (with discussion afterwards of ethical dilemmas, moral judgements, and when right is not right and wrong is not wrong, is simply a WOW.
B00005JM4Z|4.0|Out of all the sequels that came out in the summer of 2003 I have to say the one I was the most excited about was 2 Fast 2 Furious. I remeber W]walking out of an advance screening and among the crowd I saw the film many of us were saying better than the first, they didn't need Vin etc etc. John Singleton who for the record is a much better director than Rob Cohen has crafted a film that non race fans, fans of the first and those in in the mood for a good time can all enjoy. The film starts with an nice litte race between four characters in the movie and we then have our plot set up. Brian (Paul Walker) is promised a clean record if he helps the Feds bring down Carter Verone (Cole Hauser). Brian agress only if his old friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibosn) can help him. What then follows is full of eye candy in the form of cars , beautiful women and action sequences. A lot of people don't want to see this moive because it lacks the Diesel but who cares he's gone there isn't one mention of Domonic Toretto or anyone from the first film for that matter. This is Brian's story but once again his costar and sidekick Tyrese steals this movie from him. Ludacris also does a great job in his first big movie and has more than five mintues of screen time unlike Ja Rule in the first film. All in all a fun film that truly is what summer movie are about having fun. Leave your ambitions and doubts at the door and just go in and have fun with this one .
B001437DMA|4.0|Interestingly this is my first ever album review that I've done, and certainly the first on amazon; what can I say this is a Satch album after all ;)    As fair warning, I haven't heard the album extensively, so these are purely first impressions, but I'm going to make them as detailed as possible. I initially thought of avoiding the song by song analysis, but ended up going with it anyway. I'll try and offer a cohesive perspective on the album as a whole.    Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock    The album starts off with an ominous dark vibe as \\"Musterion\\" kicks off. To draw a comparison, it reminded me sort of the song \\"Belly Dancer\\" or \\"Oriental Melody\\" from the SBM album. There are definitely some interesting moments in the song, Satch's playing is quite twisted The song retains a format similar to most of Satch's \\"standard\\" more rock oriented songs - all in all an interesting album opener.    \\"Overdrive\\" continues almost where \\"Musterion\\" left off - however, it gives the listener the feeling of really settling into the album. Heavy rock-solid guitar arrangements over a pretty basic drum and bass groove. However the layering of guitar sounds really thickens up the mix, and Satch is playing those memorable hooks and big sounding chords! This is the first kind of \\"take notice\\" stereotypical Satch solo. A very pronounced minor tonality and some really nice melodies. A pretty guitar heavy and dramatic closure to the song leading straight into...    \\"I Just Wanna Rock\\" - whether a reference to the old Twisted Sister song, I don't know, but it is what it says it is. This is very similar to \\"Crowd Chant\\" off Super Colossal. Straight up bare bones rocker, which is spiced up by Satch using a Talk-Box - this is definitely going to be one for the audience.    And this is where things get real hip ~ from ZZ's dissonant tenor lines which segue into \\"Professor Satchafunkilus\\". It's all about the funk! Satch's layered melodic guitar lines pretty much tell the listener to get off the seat and move one's posterior on the downbeat. Very hip and funky, funkier than \\"The Snake\\" off his first album or \\"Cool#9\\". This is a real funky tune which I have no doubt Satch is going to use to build off to an Satchanormous jam when he plays it live! Some real sneaky and hip soloing going on there too and the song drops out to ZZ repeating his melodies - works just brilliantly.    and \\"Revelation\\". We could have done without this one. Nothing new here at all. Satch doing some soulful soloing over what sounds like a backing track. Without letting my feelings for Satch as one hip dude coming into the way, it's a pretty boring track. Nothing new here, though to its credit the song ends with some really nice soloing from Satch and picks up in intensity. But overall, disappointing given its name, anything but a revelation.    \\"Come on Baby\\" is the trademark love song that is there in every Satch album. Again, it is what is says it is. It has been done before, but there's some inventive and nice soloing in there, and the main melody is really nice almost 60ish hippie sounding.    \\"Out of the Sunrise\\" is yet again something that I personally could've done without on the album. It's pretty much like a nondescript 80s sounding track with Satch soloing on top of it, probably the lowest point of the album. Its only saving grace is when Satch breaks off into the solo halfway into the song, but it still ends with the hateful cheesy melody lines.    Thankfully Satch keeps it real by breaking into \\"Diddle-Y-A-Doo-Dat\\" with a real prog sounding intro in odd time with harmonized guitar lines which quickly segues into a down and dirty drum and bass groove. There's almost a nod to the Jeff Beck group in the way Satch explores the melodies. The shortest song in the album, it almost brings the listener back on track to let us know Satch means business. What's really unique about this song is the presence of a dirty organ arrangement - something that I've neverin the past 6 years of listening to Satriani, ever really heard!    And we're down to the last two songs on the album. Middle eastern percussions and an open stringed melody line lead into \\"Asik Vaysel\\" which is in my opinion the album's highlight. This is pure quintessential Satch doing his thing. The mystical intro leads into a straight up shred fest as only Satch can do it. Reminiscent of a live version of \\"Circles\\" in terms of song structure, but similar to \\"Surfing with the Alien\\" or \\"Flying in a Blue Dream\\" in terms of energy. Insane soloing and some great melodies and grooves.    \\"Andulasia\\" starts off in a similar manner, stripped down acoustic melodies interweaving through each other with some beautiful acoustic soloing before we get hit with this wall of transcendental guitar noise as the band kicks into full flow. Satch takes over the proceedings and blows you away like only he can. Great way to wrap up the album, you gotta listen to it to feel the energy and the vibe.    So that's about it for first impressions on the album. I'd give it a 4 out of 5 rating. The songs which stand out, definitely grab the listener and gets 'em involved into Satch's playing. However I could have done without the fillers in the album. It's not like they are bad songs, but Satch being Satch makes us have rather groovy expectations. However this album has great potential for repeat listens and though Satriani doesn't necessarily break new ground, he does his thing with panache and style. I had secretly hoped for Dave LaRue to be playing bass on the album rather than Matt Bissionette - I do NOT dig his bass playing, and Dave La Rue works incredibly well with Satch. So I was disappointed that Satch enlisted Matt Bissionette still. Therefore even though you have a drum powerhouse like Jeff Campitelli slamming the skins, the energy from the band is not at its optimum. However that said, I'm sure when they play live, the situation would be rectified. This is not Satch's best album, but it's ultimately pure Satch, so it by default makes it something worth getting your hands on.    Professor Satchafunkilus has entered the building
B00023B1LC|5.0|The Bourne Identity is a better film than I thought it would. Matt Damon makes a believeable action hero and Doug Liman does the atcion thing very well. The car chase sequence is one of the best from 2002. If you haven't seen this check it out it's good entertainement.
B0016679JW|2.0|Followed 'em since Chronic Town (that's ME in the corner, buying every album). This was recorded too loud (compare to Monster, a well-produced \\"loud\\" album)--everything is too up front on Accelerate. Lyrics...eh. 35 minutes of formulaic, bang-it-out rock. Maybe all good things come to an end, and perhaps REM should have permutated into different bands after Berry left.
B000PFU9GA|3.0|When 90210 started to lose its momentum in 1997 after the characters left college \\"Dawson's Creek\\" became the new show to watch about high school struggles. I used to idenifty with Dawson wanting to be a sucessful filmmaker because that's what I want. Pacey was the pimp on the show and all the chicks were hot.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|Oh Shakira, Shakira --- Hips don't lie and neither do my ears when I put this one on.... why else would Wyclef Jean and Rick Rubin want to work with her?  OK, OK -- well other than the fact that she is HOT!!! When she sings and pounds out the sounds she make even those of us that don't \\"habla\\" understand that talent has no language barriers. This album definitely deserved every award it earned and the only thing that would have made it better was having the video included.
B000AYELVU|5.0|Not only did X2 set the standard for the five plus sequels that came out in the summer of 2003, it's has replaced Blade 2 as my favortie comic book sequel since Superman II. From the opening action with new mutant Nightcrawler we know we are in for a amazing ride. The action sequences are taken to the next level in the film, the script is witty and there's a few surpises for us hardcore X-Men fans. Bryan Singer has made another great film in this sequel and hopefully he'll reedeem hisself with the Superman sequel.
B000002ITW|5.0|Sometimes you just have to go back to something that brought you to where you are now and enjoy it all over again -- 4 Way Street is exactly that. Live-concert recordings sometimes leave you wanting for sound quality -- but in the case of this CD -- it has been remastered -- and the songs are still THE songs that made it so great when it was first released over 3 decades ago. It has the best of the music that these four musicians made together at their prime - and many of the songs are as timely in their political impact in 2008 as they were when they were first written. This is an album that everybody who has ever listened to CSN&Y's music and loved the unmistakable harmonies these four singularly-talented artists made together must have.
B000E5N684|5.0|Paul Verhoeven has created a masterwork from Joe Eszterhas' controversial script. Several sex scenes become a leitmotif, as the participants appear to pummel, rather than love, one another with their nether parts. But the most rugged and the most erotic scene occurs between Detective Nick Curran, Michael Douglas, and his colleague, Beth Garner, portrayed by Jeanne Tripplehorn. He throws her against a wall and then against the back of a chesterfield. That is only the foreplay. In this film sex is violence, and that is Verhoeven's theme.    But there is more. Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell has a beautiful blonde form in that Beach Boy / California girl manner. She plays her 'flashing' scene in the police interrogation room with wit and a touch of class. Throughout the film she is arch, intelligent, electric. Her foil, Nick Curran, a troubled detective, realizes she might be a murderer, but finds her personality and her allure, irresistible. Douglas' performance is driven, masculine, affecting ... yet he would be well advised to keep his trousers on henceforth, for his sagging bottom is simply too comical.    There are several echoes of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (58). Both pictures have as a setting the picturesque San Francisco area. Jerry Goldsmith's music recalls Bernard Herrmann's symphonic score. The stairwell in Curran's apartment building resembles the vertiginous staircase of the Mission bell tower. And as with Hitchcock the dialogue is often simultaneously risque and humorous, although more vulgar in keeping with the tenor of modern times.    Eszterhas' script is carefully crafted, and it does not cheat. Life proves ambiguous at many levels, and so does art. The mystery is dark; the action, including a car chase, thrills; and the locale continually shifts, from a cop station to Catherine's lovely seaside house to a colorful bar where Catherine's jealous female lover and Curran engage in a sensual battle for her charms.    Day, night, sun, rain, streets, highways, scenery, ocean, sex, emotion, confrontations, death ... the film envelops everything, perhaps even love. Here, Verhoeven, Eszterhas, Douglas, Stone, have achieved some screen magic of the past
0743289692|5.0|I picked up this book after reading about Ayaan Hirsi Ali through the popular press.  What little I knew of her was that she stood as a profile of courage in the Dutch parliament and that she had worked closely with Theo Van Gough on their film \\"Submission\\".  Her book takes you thru her life, from living as a young girl in Somalia to her eventual emigration to the United States.  It is beautifully written and is both heartbreaking and inspiring.
B000O78KW4|5.0|After the so so Die Hard,2O Century Fox brought back the director of the first for the thrid go around. It was a wise choice because it's the second best sequel in the series. Die Hard: With a Vengeance is my  thrid favorite in the series because of the presence of Samuel L. Jackson and that the film is on Mcclane home turf. Bruce Willis is funnier this time around and the action sequences are amazing. Samuel L. Jackson provides a great sidekick to Mcclane and plays his angry black man with ease.
0307387178|5.0|What a sad tale. Having first seen the movie, I wanted to know more and so read Krakauer's book. The book, of course, gives many more essential details the movie never goes into, such as the devious behavior of Chris McCandless's father, and perhaps the real cause of Chris' tragic death.<br /><br />I haven't read any of the over 1000 reviews posted here. I get the sense, though, that some people find this story unworthy of being told, or that Krakauer is somehow biased in the telling of it. I disagree completely. This story is one that is happening every day. At some turning point in our lives, we faced a decision: to join up with society and seek success within it or to rush into the great unknown, for whatever reason. In Chris' case, he turned his inner turmoil into a spiritual quest for the new, the beautiful, the extraordinary, and the natural world which would somehow remove him from the corruption of his own existence, as polluted by his father and mother.<br /><br />I think Krakauer does a fantastic job in immersing us in Chris' passionate life. Almost no detail is spared. And parallels to Chris are given with others who have attempted to live in the wild, away from society's soft pleasures and easy ways. Yet no one was quite like this kid. One cannot help but think what he might have become: a fanatic Obama supporter? A deeply religious monk? A great social worker? A devoted father? A Green Peace leader? It's almost a certainty, however, that whatever he would have done, he would have thrown his heart and soul into it.<br /><br />There's no doubt that his sad, lonely death was an accident. As a father myself, I look on this book as a cautionary tale and a warning. Our children certainly are beyond our control at some point down the line, so all one can do as a parent is just be there for them, as nonjudgmentally as is humanly possible. No one was able to stop Chris from his path to Alaska, but one senses he was gaining much-needed wisdom out there in the wilderness. He was on his way back. That is the overwhelming tragedy here: the finality of his frivolous death.<br /><br />We are reminded again and again in this book of \\"the soul-flights of the adolescent\\" and the glorious ideals harbored within his or her uncompromising being. Extraordinary quotes from the works of Thoreau, Pasternak, Jack London, and others are intermingled with the overwrought writings of Chris himself. How can we not feel empathy for his troubled spirit and his longing heart? Ironically, one of the last stories he read was Tolstoy's \\"Family Matters.\\" Perhaps that title holds more meaning for all of us than we realize.way back.

630460288X|4.0|Demolition Man is a film that can please just about everyone. The film mixes three genre's succesfully and has two great male leads, Stallone and Snipes. Snipes is more fun here because he gives a larger than life performance and Sanda Bullock provides a lot of one liners. Great way to waste a afternoon with the guys.
B000E0VKXW|1.0|The CD as such is just fine. It even came sealed and was not damaged in any way.<br /><br />But if you are looking for a CD of the original LP, you will have to look further if this bothers you as much as it bothers me: in the cut \\"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\\", the two lines starting with \\"While stand the banks of England\\" are missing. Instead, on the CD (not just the MP3 file, but on the CD itself) you get a few moments of silence.<br /><br />Of course, you may not care about this.<br /><br />Another point: the volume of the CD/MP3 files is /much lower/ than usual. This is a \\"digitally remastered\\" recording, which may or may not be related to the low volume level. The low volume level, of course, may or may not matter to you. Since I use a Windows computer, and since turning up the volume for this album makes any sounds Windows choses to emit very very loud, it matters to me.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|This has to be the strongest REM album since their drummer quit.  They weren't a bad band most of the 90s and early 00s, but they weren't a great one either.  It's as if Peter Buck has rejoined the band.  Peter getting front and center on the opening track sets the tone and this continues on through this entire exuberant, downright celebratory album.<br /><br />Stipes got pretty pretentious with his lyrics the last few albums too and his sometimes borderline inane attempts are more tolerable on this one. (I even forgive him another reference to Electron Blue. Enough, Mike...)<br /><br />I'm sure many fans will see this as a return to greatness of some sort.<br /><br />This is may be true, but there just doesn't seem, to me, after you get over the shock of them being a rock band again, that many stand out tracks.  Hopefully, like their stuff in days gone by, it will grow on me and I will change my mind.
0553589059|5.0|I had been wondering if hard SF was dead, but it seems alive and kicking into new worlds and futures in this book.<br /><br />There is a LOT going on, packed into non-stop action.  There's Andre who makes a living as an assassin (someone has to do it--it's just a job, no worse than most).  There's Cricket, Andre's girlfriend, an archinformist (a data-miner of the ubiquitous headsets and data holds).  There are conjures and licensed coincidence engineers, those who can manipulate probabilities by observing them in a certain way, something that runs in Andre's family and something he aspires to rather than his job.  There is the instant transmission of matter, but not of living things (since being able to observe it messes up the transmission).  There's Earth and the Core worlds and then the wild Rim, where Green's World is located--absolutely ruled by the Charter Trade Company with a vested interest in exporting a resource that is mined by the no-tech (and therefore exploitable by law) natives, the water-based ranids or \\"froggies.\\"  There is the floating city of Novo Haven, with its lashed-together barges and wired inhabitants.  There are the wild bayous with the ranids and perhaps some ranid revolutionaries and the Greens and humans who are pro-ranids.  There is ranid physiology and communication and society.  And there is the situation where the Company wants someone with sensitive information to be killed and Andre figures he should do it since it'll be either him or someone else--even though the target turns out to be his lover Cricket's friend, Lucienne, who is the girlfriend of a conjure who Andre had hoped to convince to teach him...<br /><br />If that's not enough to begin with, then don't read this book. It just gets crazier from there.  Add in explosions and agents and rebels and retaliatory massacres and possible genocide and probability storms...  There is not a dull minute in this book.
B001437DMA|5.0|Any true fan of Satch will reluctantly admit that the last 2 satch releases - \\"Supercolossal\\" and \\"Is there love in space ?\\" are subpar in comparison to older albums (although they're still great instumental guitar records). And Mr.Satch has been having a tendency to sound \\"happier\\" than aggressive over the years and a lot of older fans may not appreciate this. This release however is Joe's return to perfection. This is an incredibly powerful record with all the right things that make Joe's music perfect - Melody, balance and perfection. All the songs are brilliant but the ones which I liked the most are :    Musterion - Aggressive, \\"mysterious\\" melody.  Professor Satchafunkilus - Gracious slice of insanely addictive funk.  Overdriver - Good old-fashioned guitar playing.  Revelation - One of the best melodies Satch has written.   Out of the Sunrise - Another \\"happy\\" Satch tune.    I would not give Satch's 2 previous releases more than 4 stars but this one and the rest of Satriani's discography get 5 stars from me !
B00000DG1R|5.0|The CD has all the main hits (pre Astronaut) plus a few lesser known hits. Some songs are edited versions so if that is an issue, beware. This is especially evident on the Rio tracks and Ordinary World. For most people, though, these are the versions they know having heard them on the radio for 20+ years. I could say that such and such song should have been included (OK, Violence of Summer) but can not find any real fault in the selection. The sound quality is fine which should not be a surprise; the sound quality of DD was always top class.
B0016679JW|5.0|R.E.M. rocks it old school         When I first listened to this album, it was like a visit from an old friend. You know how some old friends go away...and you lose touch? Maybe they join a cult, weird church, earth liberation front, political party or whatever. You are not into that stuff, so when they drop by, it is just awkward. You remember the old times, and how cool they used to be...and you feel just a bit sad that your paths diverged so much.          Anyway, that's how I've felt about the last few R.E.M. albums. That is not a comment on the quality of their work - they have always made music from their heart, just like it should be. It is just that it was wildly different from the R.E.M. albums that grabbed me by the ears, shook my booty and screamed \\"THIS IS WHAT HONEST, HEARTFELT POP-ROCK WITH ETHICS SOUNDS LIKE\\".          I also remember Peter Buck and Mike Mills visiting me in a dream to suggest that anyone with a guitar and a willingness to play from the heart could make it. And they could do it on their terms - record company execs be damned!! Man I love those guys. Michael and Bill too.          Ok, back the new album. Accelerate.          From the opening riff of the first song, I knew I was going to love it. Each additional song confirmed it. There were no re-hash, pseudo cover versions of old R.E.M. songs. This is new stuff. The magic here is that the songs on Accelerate manage to recall the sound that built R.E.M.'s empire, and yet stand on their own as current, original works.          I can't tell you the specifics of how they did what they did. All I can tell you is that if you followed R.E.M. back in the day, you are going to like this album.         Enjoy.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I remember the first time I heard the song 'What's Going On'.I was in the kitchen with my dad with the radio playing and the song came on the air.And I was amazed I had never heard a song like that before.With its multi-track vocals.Mr Marvin Gaye would come to use this technique with a lot of his other songs as well.Needless to say I bought the single right away.You know its hard to believe Marvin had to fight real hard to get this album out to the public.The powers at Motown only interest was in playing it safe and not rocking the boat.'What's Going On' is Marvin Gayes masterpiece and surely one of the best R&B recordings ever.It's as if Marvin Gaye was looking into a crystal ball while he was writing this album.And then singing about events that would still be taking place 10,20,40,50, years and maybe even more into the future.This album hits on everything from God,bigotry,taxs,social injustice the environment and the frustrations that sometime come with every day life.Marvin Gaye bought these things up before it became politically correct to do so.With songs like Inner City Blues,What's Going On and Mercy Mercy Me just to name a few.This album reads like today's newspaper headlines and is filled with lyrics just crying out to be heard.'What's Going On' gives us Marvin Gaye at his creative peak.And he will go on to do two more noteworthy albums 'Let's Get It On' and 'I Want You' two albums that are must haves for fans of Marvin Gaye.But to me this album 'What's Going On' is the best.What's Going On would also insprie others like Stevie Wonder,Curtis Mayfield,The Isley Brothers and so many others to take their music to a new level.This is one ablum that really changed the music industry for good.Well,many years have come and gone since that day in the kitchen with my dad.My dad is gone now,Marvin is gone now.But the question this album brings up is still with us today 'WHAT'S GOING ON?'.

B000WMEAKC|5.0|I first heard the song *Apologize* on \\"So You Think You Can Dance\\" last season... the 2 dancers that performed to it were mesmerizing and this song stayed with me after the show. Later I heard it on the radio but it wasn't the version that I had fell in love with it was a mix by Timbaland then all of a sudden EVERYONE is listening to them. I was glad that these artists got the exposure because that was just one of the good songs on this CD.<br /><br />I finally purchased the CD yesterday... am Happy to report/review this is a solid CD at least 5 good songs that I liked enough to burn onto my hard drive at work to listen to. I would say about (to me) 2 different tempo variations.

B0006B2A2E|5.0|First off, I could go on and on about how AMAZING this movie it, let me just tell you that it is really worth seeing. It really makes you think and you will find someway to relate to it. It takes a real look at how relationships are and how people fall in love, not like you see in other movies where you are like; \\"Yeah, right, that would never happen.\\" In fact you could swear it was based off a relationship you are in, or a relationship you had in the past. The actors all play their parts quite well and you really get in to it, you really can understand and feel for the characters. I would suggest this movie to everyone I know ... you wont regret it.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|This isn't really a stand alone movie. It's actually the wrap up for the TV series that SCI FI stupidly cancelled (yet has wrestling, that makes sense). The plot in this movie was actually intended to be the last three episodes of season ten and the first three episodes of season 11. Then the show got cancelled so they held off production and those watching the series never had a wrap-up. What does this mean for the viewer. It means that if you weren't watching the series, you may not get a whole lot out of the movie because it relies heavily on what viewers have been watching for the last 10 seasons. If you're looking for a stand alone wait for the next one.
B000089RVX|2.0|Fallen by Evanescence is a pop/rock album gone wrong. Amy Lee's vocals are good but then after you hear the songs again, her voice gets annoying and over-done, it is all too much to take in. My Immortal, Going Under, and Bring Me To Life just fade with time, I never want to hear those songs again. The only track with meaning is Everybody's Fool. Evanesence is one band I wish would go away!
B000WO251Q|3.0|I started reading this book last year. The beginning was kind of boring, so after a few months I picked up the book again...and finished it in a few days. The book was overall good with very likeable characters, but the ending...o why so sad? I love Nicholas S.! I've read so many books of his and they were all sad...but heartfilling sad. This was just tragicly sad. I didnt like that. I like to know that love conquers all...and even though they loved each other...they just ended up being unhappy...Ah! Just too sad and depressing. This Nicholas S's book did not leave me feeling that love is the greatest thing in the world, like his other books have. So, if i recommend a book of his to anyone...I wont recommend this one.
B000H2NA30|2.0|I would give 2 and a half stars.  This is a good read in that any account of human experiences is important to remind us of the evils in the world, and human resilience nevertheless.  The writing, however, is too rudimentary, and one dimensional.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|The movie is both good and entertaining, the acting is simply superb, the historic reconstruction is very believable.
B0013FXWVU|4.0|Let's start with the conclusion so you won't need to read my ramblings; this is a good family film.  Other than a few mildly scary moments, parents really have nothing to fear from this movie.  The animation is exactly what it should be and the voice actors are nearly perfect (I liked them all, rare for me).  I laughed out loud several times.  I recommend you take your family to see this.  If you are a fan of computer animation I would also recommend it, though it has nothing really new to offer technically speaking.<br /><br />Concerning the title of this review.<br />First, let's address why Dr. Seuss has not been done right on the big screen... ...yet.<br /><br />-\\"Cat in the Hat\\" was a big budget piece of slurry.  Young kids enjoy it for its color and crazy antics.  Perhaps the worst thing Mike Myers has done.  Adults enjoy it because they are out of their minds (or does it just seem that way to me?).<br /><br />-\\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" was only slightly more tolerable than CITH.  Jim Carrey is at his most obnoxious.  This charming tale is dragged through the mud. It's becoming clear that Dr. Seuss does not translate to live-action very well.<br /><br />-None of the TV cartoon efforts were really feature films, though I think they were nearly perfect translations of the books to Small Screen (other than music that often became dated).<br /><br />This brings us to 2008s \\"Horton Hears a Who\\".  Starting with...<br /><br />... what has us closer to enjoying a Dr. Seuss film done \\"right\\":<br /><br />-Computer animation might be the perfect format for translating Dr. Seuss to the big screen.  Graphically, everything looked like a Dr. Seuss book in bright and wonderful 3D.  If the world of Horton were real, this is what it would/should look like in my mind.<br /><br />-The voice actors all did, at least, good jobs.  Jim Carrey was under control and actually quite loveable and funny as the soft spoken Horton.  Steve Carell was equally suited to his role as the Mayor; a bit flighty yet noble.  Carol Burnett as the paranoid and parochial kangaroo was a pure professional.  I love Carol Burnett but hated this Kangaroo.  The narration by Charles Osgood was perfect.  I can't think of anyone better.  The rest of the voice cast of fairly famous people was at best enjoyable and at worst nondescript.<br /><br />-This story needed to be stretched to make it a feature film.  The writers did a good job of adding to the story without actually changing it.  They basically took the scenes from the original and added detail and visual narration to them; very clever and faithful to the original.  There are plenty of funny moments added as well.<br /><br />Why we still have not seen a Dr. Seuss film done \\"right\\".<br /><br />-The original \\"Horton Hears a Who\\" responds to the paranoia of McCarthyism.  Though the theme of paranoia is still present in the 2008 version, it is watered down or translated to represent censorship in general.  Horton is \\"accused\\" of sparking the kid's imaginations with fabrications of people living on a speck.  Most people today believe all voices should have a chance to be heard, so it does not elicit the same emotional response the original did.  I'm not sure this could be fixed in the current environment, but it is a problem that weakened the films impact for me.<br /><br />-The 2008 version almost completely ignores the silly, fabricated \\"Dr. Seuss\\" words.  Charles Osgood's narration is the only element taken word for word from the book.  I'm not sure this is a bad thing (it may have gotten tedious) but a little bit of \\"Seussian\\" jargon might have given the film a better Dr. Seuss feel.  Again, this is something that I debate in my own mind; would \\"Seussian\\" language enhance or hurt the feel of the film?<br /><br />-The Small screen version had many songs.  The 2008 version has one; \\"Can't Fight This Feeling Anymore\\" by REO Speedwagon.  Beside the fact that I hate this song, it really smelled of Hollywood marketing.  I was surprised the Whos weren't all holding Coke cans in their hands.  Could they have not come up with a strong original song that would stand the test of time?  This one just bugged me.<br /><br />-The anime sequence; a very humorous but wildly out of place sequence fresh out of Horton's imagination.  This really did great harm to the feel of the film being \\"Dr. Seuss\\" like.  I thought it was funny though.<br /><br />I think that's enough.  In the final synopsis, this is a highly enjoyable film with great acting, great visuals and a few good laughs and still a good message.  I will definitely buy the DVD. My wife and I both enjoy animated \\"kids\\" films but came away not completely satisfied with this.  I'm still not sure if I captured why it felt somewhat incomplete or \\"not right\\".  The good news is this is much closer to being right than the prior Dr. Seuss big screen debacles.  I recommend this for families and animation fans; everyone else is on their own.up with a strong original song that would stand the test of time?

B00133KFGW|4.0|Ahhhhh yes, I needed that. After weeks of \\"No Country for Old Men, Micheal Clayton, Atonement, Into the Wild, and the Kite Runner\\", it was finally nice to come home from a stressful day and watch a movie that left me wiping my red eyes and feeling good inside. Too bad the academy was focused on dark films this year, because this should have gotten a nomination. Though some scenes might be emotionally tough for kids between 5-8, I still feel this is a great family film. By family film I mean kids can watch it and like it, but parents will be the ones who really enjoy it. Like many people have said here, put fairy tale in your head before you watch it, so your not like the few who say, \\"not believable\\". A beautiful, sweet, heartwarming film.
1400063515|3.0|The greatest parts of the book could have been trimmed of the fat, as others have already pointed out. He spends a lot of time talking about himself. I got the sense this grew out of his own ethnic insecurities, since throughout the first half of the book he constantly reminds the reader that he's Leventhine (and not altogether happy with the more common but less accurate term, Lebanese).<br /><br />That, and he really should can the frequent references to the French language. Even if it is his native tongue, his incessant references to it come off as foppish, snooty and condescending. His points can instead be made in the lingua franca (another favorite term of his).<br /><br />I probably got it worse than the rest of the reviewers, since I listened to the audio book version on a long car ride. Though it was read by a narrator and not the author, it was a 12 disc set resembling a punishingly long winded college lecture.<br /><br />It's disappointing to have to write anything negative about this book, since it does take some new directions well worth exploring. His take on the inaccurate comparisons between gambling as we know it and probability; his assertion that the military folk he met were the only professionals truly accustomed to \\"unknown unknowns,\\" and other gems here and there kept me from putting it away prematurely.<br /><br />But nevertheless at the end of nearly every chapter, I was left hanging; waiting for the punch line, so to speak. He often doesn't fully make his point. Either that or he staggers it unnecessarily among several chapters as if to tantalize the reader - it doesn't work.<br /><br />Then again, this type of work might best be appreciated in print format, especially when he speaks of the bell curve statistics and charts better left for visual interpretation.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Musically, it is very similar to \\"Monster,\\" which I love. Lyrically, it is much better than \\"Monster.\\" Michael is FINALLY railing against the U.S. government, as opposed to \\"Monster\\" when he was playing characters.    They needed this renaissance because \\"Around the Sun\\" is just an unspeakable piece of filth. I listened to it once then I was tempted to throw it away. I will listen to this album in its entirety at least five times TODAY.    Maybe the guys should remember the advice that Bill Berry gave to them when they made \\"Monster\\": R.E.M. IS A ROCK BAND-- DON'T BE AFRAID TO MAKE ROCK ALBUMS.

B000002AH9|5.0|Even after more then 50 years, Billie Holiday (a singer before my time) songs can still capture the heart of many who listen to her singing and her emotion behind her song. Ella has always been my facourite.     However, it was by chance that I listened to Bilie Holiday's voice and was quickly captured my attention. I have many of her recordings CD from the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. In the early years, her voice was sweet. However, it was her recording in her 50s that I can truley feel what she is singing.    The songs from the Lady in Satin CD truley revealed Billie's inner emotions especially in the songs: I am a Fool to want you; and The End of a Love affair...songs that can really bring tears into your eyes.    Enjoy your Billie Holiday Lady in Satin CD...even though her voice has become rough, her strong emtion behind the songs truley made them a real timeless Classic!     I cannot seem to think of any other songs that can be so sad and so emotional!    Thanks for giving us the songs!
B0010X745K|2.0|The ending of this movie is so horrible and disappointing. I just finished watching this movie and I'm actually depressed!! I've read other reviews and some say the ending is to be expected because this is a horror film, but jeez!! I want a HORROR film to leave me scared and afraid to turn the lights off, not sad and depressed!!! I just can't believe the ending...I was so excited to see this movie and now I wish I would have watched it up to the ending and than turned it off, because up to the end it was a pretty decent movie. They totally ruined Stephen King's book! In my opinion anyway....
B0011NVC9I|5.0|Based on one of the first written poems in the English language, Beowulf, is an enthralling masterpeice of the 21st century. Even for those who are not big on English literature, or history even, this would still be a commendable flick. If you are merely enthralled by an action-packed,cut-em-below-the-waist,intensifying film, Beowulf is sure to deliver. The film stays true to its origin epic antecedent by falliing to neglect those imperative literary aspects that make an epic an awe-aspiring film. This film packs a modern day twist with a delivery that will hit you harder than a set of brass knuckles. Characterization is an entirely different story, 5 thumbs up, I need not say more; cutting-edge plot sequences are not even half of the story, or need I say epic that one will discover through viewing this film. To discover the rest just watch the film; it is a must see.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I was very impressed by the acting, the singing, the sets, the storyline, the costumes... and Tim Burton does a wonderful job as director. Although I have to warn you, there is quite a bit of blood, but mostly in the second half of the movie (though it didn't bother me). I highly recommend this film!
B001453LX8|5.0|This Album is excellent. I am excited for The Return of the Ankh album in the Summer cause this CD is FIRE WATER AIR AND EARTH!!!! Political messages, universal relative metaphors, riddles, channelling Afrikan ancestors and ancient heartfelt soul. This is Baduism that doesnt disappoint but then again, how often does Erykah Badu disappoint??????!!!! ( Never disappointed me!)    It is not mainstream radio friendly '' music''so if you are used to listening to T-Pain and Chris Brown or Beyonce or Rihanna then you probably wont have an ear or the taste for real music like this here.
B0016679JW|4.0|This is a solid REM album. The last several albums have had their moments but this one seems consistent. It also sounds in may respects like a classic REM effort.<br /><br />At times it seems like I'm listening to Fables of the Reconstruction, at times it seems like Automatic. They even touch on approach Murmur and Reckoning a bit, not as much though it's there in some respects, but the enunciation is too much to really get the same feel.<br /><br />The background vocals from Mills help to give that older feel while still remaining fresh. For some reason, the chorus of Man Sized Wreath makes me think of These Days from Lifes Rich Pageant - though I'm not really sure why.<br /><br />I don't agree with some of the reviews about the lyrics. I think there's some good writing to be found. There's also several titles/references to older songs (e.g. think of feeling gravity's pull and the listen for it).<br /><br />If you're an IRS REM fan or a WB REM fan, you should be able to find something to like.
B00008RV1L|3.0|In all honesty, the first three quarters of `American Psycho' is flawless.  I have made my distain for this film obvious to many people but upon reflection even I must admit that the majority of its parts are pure brilliance.  And then the fourth quarter comes along and then entire film falls to pieces.  Honestly I don't think that Mary Harron understood Bret Easton Ellis' novel.  I am a huge fan of the book (I have it listed as one of the top five books everyone should own) and have learnt to embrace its controversial and disturbing overtones because underneath it all `American Psycho' (the novel) is a masterful depiction of humanity at its realist.  I know that it has been noted that Ellis' enjoyed this movie adaptation, and maybe that should mean something for me, but I still can't help but gawk at its overly comical ending.<br /><br />When you read `American Psycho' it gets under your skin; first because of the gross and graphic depictions of murder and mayhem, but ultimately it crawls beneath you because you begin to rationalize with inhumanity.  You begin to realize that this man is trapped, as are you and I, in a world that places so much value on the clothes we wear and the toys we own that the value of another's life is tragically degraded.  What garners more attention; the murder of a homeless man or a blowout sale at JCPenney?  The answer is as obvious as it is heartbreaking.<br /><br />Mary Harron's adaptation loses that for me.  In the end Patrick Bateman is degraded to the depiction of a crazed lunatic as apposed to the ultimate portrayal of a society lost.  He's made fun of as apposed to being made fear-inspiring.  I vividly remember an image of a crouched over Christian Bale feasting on human flesh and I remember shaking my head in disgust for what Ellis' brilliant work of modern literature had been reduced to.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with the fantastic acting within this film, which I feel compelled to point out.  Christian Bale serves up one of the greatest performances of his career and certainly one of the best of that given year (can you say Oscar snub).  He truly gets inside Patrick Bateman, residing within his delusions and creating a truly terrifying as well as understandable character.  Chloe Sevigny also delivers as Bateman's secretary Jean.  Her scene within his apartment, the scene with the nail gun, is my favorite scene in the film.  Reese Witherspoon is great here, if not underused, and Jared Leto has one of the most memorable scenes here (the one scene in the film that really crawled beneath my skin).<br /><br />You know, while I'm on that subject I might as well stay on that subject.  Jared Leto plays Paul Allen, one of Bateman's `victims'.  The murder scene is graphic yet done in a mesmerizing satirical way that truly captures what Ellis' novel was all about.  Why oh why could the climax of this film have been done in the same splendid manner?  I'm baffled because one scene is pure brilliance while the other is C-Grade cheesiness.<br /><br />I just want to throw my hands up in dire frustration.<br /><br />In the end I guess I'm forced to give this the thumbs down.  It could have been such a fantastic film; maybe even the best of the year.  The source material, while completely and understandably controversial and offensive, is one of the greatest and most influential novels to have ever been penned.  Mary Harron had a major opportunity here to build on greatness and deliver something the world has never seen.  A lot of critics praised this movie; which goes to show that I will never understand this society's idea of a critic.  It begins with such masterful potential and it builds on it with such fire only to freefall into stupidity and destroys everything it worked so hard to accomplish.  I give it three stars, nothing more and nothing less; which is sad because during its first three quarters I was so sure it would receive nothing but praise from me.  Bale is genius, I will give thismovie that, but even his brilliance could not save this film from itself.save this film from itself.
B000001FSP|5.0|i thought this album was good 20years ago...never bought it  caught myself humming the tune to the witches song 3 weeks ago & decided to go find the cd...brilliant
B000UZ4G8M|3.0|I love the show and always enjoy the music they use in context.  I downloaded a few of the songs from itunes, which were wonderful, then bit the bullet and bought this set.  The music is ok if you're in the mood for it, but the songs I'd already downloaded (4 or 5) were much better than anything else in the set.  Not worth full price.
B000023X9W|5.0|when this record came out i thought is was nice but somewhat disspointingly lightweight..Two songs-red sun and without rings being the exception and obvious masterpeices..then some freinds told me it was an absolute masterpiece,,then someone else told me the same thing..i then took this album and a bunch of others to a womens refuge to someone i knew in the depthes of depression and drug addiction..she later told me how so many of the ladies in the refuge simply loved the compassion and beauty of this album..i then replayed it..and now i love it.. i love it as much as i love any other neil album..beautiful..his most gentle, inrtrospective, inward looking album..a criminally underatted,brilliant album..today i took this cd with a bunch of others with me on a drive in the car..and i loved it so much i thought id write up a recommendation..neils greatest accoustic/country album

0321525655|4.0|Garr does a terrific job of explaining the basics of presenting, debunking the current trend of \\"put an outline on a page and read it\\".  He correctly coaches the reader that the \\"outline method\\" (my term, not his) is offensive to the crowd and adds little to the presentation.  He presents the information of such researchers as the Heath brothers and Tufte, two giants in the field.  While unnecessary for those of us who are very familiar with their work, for anyone else learning about excellence in presentations they are a welcome additional overview.    What makes this book stand apart, however, is Garr's commitment to share with the reader presentation slides and concepts, so that the ideas are brought to life.  With as visual as the concepts are, it would have been a huge miss to have not included many examples.  He provided this essential linkage and payout to the theories and suggestions his book presents.    My copy is already a bit battered from use, and I suspect it will get more so as time continues.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to take their presentation skills to the next level.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Cinematic beauty and two people who end up falling in love.  It doesn't matter if it's two men it is love between two people and caring for someone is a wonderful thing to find in life as so many never truely do. If it had been different time in our history these two men could have been together instead of having their relationship in the shadows.<br /><br />Sadly even today many men do that and even ones whom are married to a woman all becuase this country is still far behind the world in accepting anyone and everyone for who they are and that loving another really holds no boundries as is often the case with narrow minded people or people of extreme religious beliefs.<br /><br />However, it is America and we are all free to think and feel what we want.
B00109T5WY|5.0|This Will Destroy You's debut EP \\"Young Mountain,\\" while it was good, didn't quite send shivers up my spine like a lot of other post-rock bands tend to do. Their songs dragged on a little too much and while it was pretty, it wasn't anything TOO special.    So here comes their full-length self-titled album. This album, in my opinion, is miles ahead of Young Mountain. The build-ups are fantastic, the guitar work is fantastic with beautiful harmonies throughout and the climaxes are executed beautifully.    The opening track \\"A Three-Legged Workhorse\\" has many different colours throughout. The track opens with quiet guitar and light glitch drums...very nice, indeed. The acoustic drums kick in and everything goes uphill from there until a beautiful electronica-aided climax erupts. The rest of the song is really an ambient trip with soft guitars and hypnotizing drums. Fantastic.    Villa Del Rufigo is a very soothing, soft, percussion-less and ultimately beautiful track.     Threads has a pretty basic post-rock structure. It is a very beautiful song, though, that's for sure. The song doesn't stop for anything. It's a march forward until it's had enough and leaves you nearly breathless.    Leather Wings is a short little track...I'd almost call it an interlude. With reverbing guitars, a simple snare beat, and ambient sounds all over, it's truly a hauntingly beautiful little interlude.    Ahh, yes. The Mighty Rio Grande. At 11:18, this track stands high with another track that I haven't gotten to yet. There's a steady 4.5 minute crescendo until it finally fades into almost nothing again, just like it started. It then crescendos AGAIN into yet another beautifully full sound with extremely rich texture.    Clocking in at around 7:00, They Move on Tracks of Never-Ending Light is an extremely catchy and nostalgic song...something about it makes your mind wander to so many different things. The whole thing is essentially quiet, with glitch drums yet again...A very nice song.Which brings us to the amazing conclusion that is \\"Burial on the Presido Banks.\\" I would like to personally congratulate This Will Destroy You on creating one of the most addicting, beautiful, goreous, and powerful songs I've ever heard. The build-up is done perfectly with truly fantastic chord progression until it drops down yet again and builds up rather quickly, eventually turning into something absolutely beautiful...This is definitely my favourite track on the album. Distortion, reverbing guitars, and crashing cymbals are all used here and together they create something truly special. The first time I heard this track, I was totally blown away.    So, yes, I do believe this album deserves a 5/5. It's a very well-deserved 5/5. Congrats, TWDY. I'm looking forward to hearing more. Buy this.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|This is a cartoon adventure like none you have ever seen before, and the likes of which you are likely to not ever see again in your lifetime!  It is simply enchanting, and I think you will find that you and your wife (or husband) will have a great date night if you watch Bee Movie and cook up some pasta and garlic bread and maybe a little chocolate truffles for dessert!    It is great to see cartoons advanced to this stage, and I must admit I don't get a chance to see too many these days, but I am very impressed with what they can do nowadays!  You're sitting there listening to the hilarious Jerry Seinfeld crack jokes, but you can't see his face--instead you're seeing the face of a (yellow) bee--and he moves his lips along with the words that Jerry Seinfeld is saying (somewhere off camera).  It's similar to that great TV show, \\"Puttin' On the Hitz,\\" where they do lip-syncing.    Jerry Seinfeld is hilarious as usual, and I wish that they could have had a Kramer bee too!  Or maybe a wasp could be Newman!  Hey, maybe I should be writing these movies.  Just kidding.    The colors are very vivid and I don't recommend this for children!!!    Bee Movie gets an \\"A\\" in my book, and I'm not going to give it a \\"B\\" just because that would be a great pun to make.  I don't believe puns should ever be used to denigrate great works of art like Picasso's paintings, or Dickens' novels, or \\"Bee Movie.\\"

1590171993|4.0|Annotation of John Williams' Stoner       In his novel Stoner, John Williams' title character is the epitome of what I'm going to call an `American Tragic Hero' (Look for action figures, coming Summer '08). As opposed to the tragic hero in the classical sense, not much personal action drives the story of his life, but instead it is existential inaction that leads to his emotional downfall, if not premature death. What at first seems like a novel in the tradition of a bildungsroman, a novel of personal development, it soon gives way to an irreversible lull in Stoner's life, feelings of regret and imposed self-sacrifice. With quiet yet affecting language, Williams portrays relationships in Stoner's life as reaching their peak at the point of introduction, and deteriorating, almost organically, from that point on.    The novel begins as a story of growth, detailing his early years in college, the years in which we believe to lay our foundation for the future ahead. With the urging of an influential, yet world-weary professor, Stoner decides to turn his studies away from agriculture and move in the direction of literature. This decision may not be the most important in Stoner's life, but, literature and his profession becomes an outlet for escaping the difficulties born out of his other choices. From this point on Stoner acts, or in some cases fails to act, so as to maintain the status quo in both his professional and personal life, regardless of the emotional detachment he feels from each.      The existential voice of sobering reason in the story comes early on from his colleague Dave Masters, who leaves Stoner's life just as quickly as he entered it, nevertheless leaving an indelible impression on the back of Stoner's mind, a place reserved for the fundamental questions Stoner has about his life. Here, Master's keenly observes the tragic personal conflict that will plague Stoner throughout his life:    You think there's something here, something to find. Well, in theworld you'd learn soon enough. You, too, are cut out for failure, not that you'd fight the world. You'd let it chew you up and spit you out, and you'd lie there wondering what was wrong. Because you'd always expect the world to be something it wasn't, something it had no wish to be...you're too weak, and you're too strong. And you have no place in the world (31).    In very direct language Williams lays out the definitive problem that Stoner faces, only it is posed as more of a condition than a problem. For what does it mean to be too weak yet too strong in this world? Not surprisingly it's an existential conundrum, the solution also being the problem. Should one accept the fact that they \\"have no place in the world\\", then they in essence lower their expectations of life with cool detachment; should they deny and insist on participating in this world then they open themselves up to regret and failure. Here then Stoner's intellectual stoicism is at odds with what is considered the `good life' in this country: Good job, good kids, good wife. In all these aspects of Stoner's life, Williams shows how easily inner turmoil can quickly manifest itself into the physical world and the lives that populate it. Stoner chooses life, at least his ideal conception of it. When he looks upon his wife and child he chooses to hold fast to the ideal versions of them, despite how things really are. In this manner does Stoner participate in the world, with futile bravery, allowing himself to get \\"chewed up and spit out.\\"  John Williams' writing style recalls that of post-WWI realists, using stripped down language and objective prose to capture deeply subjective moods. Williams doesn't attempt to color the prose with descriptives  and adjectives; the writing is bare and the emotion raw so that the reader reacts to the actual characters and not the language that describes them. In this way, Williams brings the reader closer to the story and distanced from the writing. One of the more striking passages in the novel comes when Stoner is on his deathbed staring at his wife, reflecting on a marriage that amounted to a subtextual standoff, neither party willing to fold in to their emotions. Williams writes, \\"Almost without regret he looked at her now; in the soft light of the late afternoon her face seemed young and unlined. If I had been stronger, he thought; if I had known more; if I could have understood. And then, finally, mercilessly, he thought: if I had loved her more (272).\\" Stoner has come to terms with his failures in life, as his old buddy David Masters predicted, \\"Lying there wondering what went wrong.\\" Even near death Stoner remains the tragic hero, still believing in love and its transformative powers, even though a sort of existential fatalism has trumped throughout his life.    Stoner is a novel that thrives in its quiet simplicity, striking emotional conflict with the characters' actions in equal portions to their inaction. Williams shows the futility of asserting \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" choices in life; rather, it's the act of making a choice that makes one a participant in this world, and its regret that affirms their love for it.
B0002ADY1A|5.0|You might be wondering if this is worth getting instead of the standard version of the album. Well I don't feel I can add much to what has been written by the previous reviewers about the album itself(check the product page for the non-import version for 'about a billion reviews') except to say this is probably the best starting point for those looking to buy their first Uriah Heep album.     However the standard version is missing the bonus material, more specifically the track 'Why'.   Now normally I'm not a huge fan of the duff demos, lame out-takes and single-versions(often inferior, clumsily edited versions of the original) that make up the majority of bonus material found on 'expanded and remastered' editions, but there are exceptions and boy is this one of them. Apparently this track was unearthed while compiling this edition of the album and, such is its obscurity, that no one even knows who played bass on it.     The track itself is amazing; 10 minutes of stunning interaction between guitar, organ and bass all overlayed with the Uriah Heep's trade mark multi-part harmony backing vocals. The amazing thing is it doesn't sound like any thing else on the album and yet is so definitively 'Heep'. The Bass in particular stands out, powerful and ,at times, almost funky; it drives the piece along thrillingly.     If you don't own the album but have an interest in the music of this era (Deep Purple and Wishbone Ash come to mind) then it is an essential purchase in this form. If you already own a copy of this album without the bonus material then I suggest(and I would never normally do so) it is worth getting this version if only for 'Why'
B000002OZY|5.0|Alongside Days of Future Passed (Moody Blues, 1967) and In the Court of the Crimson King (King Crimson, 1969), Tommy (1969) has got to be one of my favorite rock records of all time. For me, the appeal lies with the strong melodies, the wonderfully played instrumental passages and the overall concept. I suppose too, that there are \\"progressive\\" elements to the music that are also attractive as well; elements that would be explored further on the Who's other magnum opus Quadrophenia (1973).<br /><br />This concept album was evidently inspired by another (earlier) rock concept album entitled S.F. Sorrow (Pretty Things, 1968) and showcases Pete Townshend's abilities as a performer (vocals, electric and acoustic guitars, keyboards) and as an arranger/composer - what he does here on Tommy with just a few central themes is fantastic. The rest of the group is equally stunning and both Keith Moon (drums and vocals) and John Entwistle (bass, French horn and vocals) drive everything along with power and dexterity. Roger Daltry (vocals, harmonica) is an excellent and explosive singer, but is very expressive as well and nicely relates the underlying story of Tommy with help from the rest of the band. With respect to instrumentation, a host of instruments including electric and acoustic guitars, piano, organ, percussion, French horn (courtesy of John Entwistle), and most importantly rich, three-part vocal harmonies are employed.  Although the effects are subtle, the varied instrumentation and vocal harmonies really add to the fullness of the recording.<br /><br />While the instrumentation and instrumental tracks are collectively interesting, like everybody else, I enjoy the popular radio tunes Pinball Wizard, I'm Free, See Me, Feel Me and We're Not Gonna' Take It. Generally however, I prefer to listen to the entire album as a complete work. Speaking of which, the individual tracks that comprise Tommy are arranged in a song-cycle, with instrumental interludes positioned at key points. In addition, central themes are restated throughout the cycle, which serve to link the individual songs through which the story of Tommy unfolds. Both the song-cycle and the restatement of central themes are techniques taken from classical music and Pete uses both very well.  I should note that while some folks feel that the instrumental passages constitute \\"filler\\" I am of the opinion that they work just fine and really are an integral part of the overall composition.  The lengthy Underture (approx. 10:00) is a good example of an instrumental interlude on the album.<br /><br />This remastered album is nice and it is pretty cool that they were able to squeeze the entire double LP album onto one compact disc. The sound quality is very good and the liner notes feature the artwork and lyrics.<br /><br />All in all, this is yet another landmark recording by an English rock group that has withstood the ravages of time (unlike my old LP) and is highly recommended along with Quadrophenia.ints.

1582701709|5.0|I read this in about 3 hours then I rented the DVD.  Not one time did they say something that was new to me.  It was just kind of like a refresher course.  God loves us and we are what we think.
020530902X|5.0|A very good book and a great reference for anyone to have with them at school, home, work.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I originally rented this DVD from my local video store and after watching it twice and watching it again with the director's comments I knew I had to own this movie.  It's a beautiful little movie that everyone should see.  Congratulations to Glen and Mara for receiving the Academy Award....well deserved.
B00132D808|2.0|For those of you who loved rocking out to A Fever You Can't Sweat Out (for me that means jumping around the room), you'll probably be disappointed with this CD.  It lacks the pizazz/jam sound of a song like I Write Sins Not Tragedies, and there's certainly nothing you can dance around in your pajamas to.  Honestly, the songs are almost boring.  I've listened to it a couple of times but I'm still finding it lacking.  I would recommend previewing the album before you buy it, had I done so, I probably wouldn't have bought it.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie is a delight for all ages.  The animation is fantastic and looks very realistic.  The movie has a good tempo and you are unlikely to be bored by it.
B00004TJTS|5.0|This little known movie is so awesome if you are a dog lover and it may bring you to tears as we know that dogs have a much shorter life span than us humans (10-15yrs for most dog breeds).  It is a heart warming story that may remind you of your childhood and your first dog as a kid.  Kevin Bacon and Frankie Muniz are great as Father and son and the dog is pure joy and as mischevious as any puppy or child.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|One of the best purchases I've made.  Includes all seasons and extras for those that really grew with this cast as the years went on like I did.  I would recomend this for new and old fans alike!

B000XTLUW0|4.0|HAARP is the answer to the question of why Muse scoops just about every single \\"best live act\\" award that they are nominated for. We're talking about a band that has been able to master every single aspect of live entertainment on a career that has spanned over the past 10 years.  Being lucky enough to witness Muse on stage 6 times, I have to say that their performance never gets boring, and it's never short of fascinating. Matt Bellamy's voice, guitar riffs and distortions bring all that on-stage magic, backed of course by the stunning drum performance of Dom Howard, and the brilliant bass lines and backing vocals of Chris Wolstenholme.  Anyone who's been lucky enough to witness the Muse live experience knows that it's powerful, over the top, and enchanting.  In other words, Muse makes U2 look like Hannah Montana.    I truly wanted to give this DVD a 5 star review, but the only thing that stops me from doing so is the lack of extra features. Certain songs from the performance on the night of June 17th are missing, as well as songs from the 16th that weren't played on the 17th, including:    - Sing For Absolution  - Bliss  - City of Delusion  - Citizen Erased  - Sunburn  - Man of Mystery  - Microcuts    Let's just hope that we will be able to witness these performance, on a Blu-Ray release of HAARP.  Nevertheless HAARP could easily be considered among the best concert DVD releases ever.
B000K15VSA|5.0|The first time I saw Blade Runner, it was on television and it was the original theatrical version with the narrations. I fell in love and bought the DVD version only to find out that the \\"Director's Cut\\" lacked the narrations, and in place of the narration there were some awkward silences. I still loved the movie, but I was let down.<br /><br />Finally the original theatrical release, with the cheesy detective narration is released, and the image quality is amazing!<br /><br />Not only do you get the original theatrical version, but you get the directors cut, work-print version (with scenes not seen in the ther versions) and \\"Final Cut\\" version which looks and sounds amazing. All of this comes in a briefcase that resembles a voight-kampf case. It also comes with some interesting concept art prints, a model police spinner and a small unicorn origami statue.<br /><br />This is an amazing value even at 3 times the price. This is the edition of the movie that was released for those of us the love Blade Runner. this movie was 23 years in the making and they finally got it right!
0783114893|4.0|Rutger Hauer dominates this classy thriller, with a performance that matches his role in Bladerunner. Every twitch he makes is scary and from the start of the film you are left in no doubt that this guy is seriously deranged. Occasionally some of the other actors wern't quite up to the same standard, but in general this is a well acted film.<br /><br />Forget about plot and any sense that this could really happen. Think more of Halloween and translate Michael Myers as the Hitcher and you'll be closer. Its well photographed with some images that have almost become iconic.<br /><br />What surprised me about this film was the way characters that you might normally expect to survive (in a Hollywood film) did not in The Hitcher. So credit where credit is due, not only is this a short and punchy thriller, but it does the unexpected on more than one occasion.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Simply Kubrick at his best! Directing, writing, the cast all showing how to make a good film!
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Excellent album. Outstanding production and excellent songwriting and music performance. This is my favourite Dream Theater album beside Scenes From a Memory.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I have waited some time to watch this series, mainly to be able to see it in our new home theatre (65\\" LCD and 5.1 surround) on blu-ray. It's simply awesome. I listened to an NPR (National Public Radio) conversation with one of the producers, and knowing what the filmmakers went through to capture the footage made the experience even better. We watched all the episodes as a family - you can't beat the bonding! Highly recommended.
0143038419|2.0|I have a hard time reviewing this book.  On the one hand, Elizabeth is a very gifted writer.  Her words flow easily through your mind as you read them and her book is engaging, charming, and pleasant to read.    On the other hand, I objectively find Elizabeth's lifestyle to be childish and irresponsible.  I want to dislike her for this (as many other reviewers have).  But I am somewhat sympathetic because I think there is a good chance she is bipolar.      She seems to have a difficulty commiting to anything in her life, and is constantly plagued by a turbulent mind.  She vacillates between nights of sobbing depression (when reflecting upon her current 'commitments' in life) and giddy exuberance (when envisioning a potential abandon of those present obligations).  She is constantly seeking \\"balance\\", which is something coveted by most bipolar individuals.  If you read about her history in the biography on her website, you'll see that she lived as a vagabond traveler for much of her adult life, bouncing from odd job to odd job in search of the next great thing.  A lot of bipolars are gregarious and charming (making lots of friends) at certain times, but during others they fall apart and are needy and annoying.  Hence they have problems maintaining a stable relationship.      Elizabeth is someone who would be fun to meet and enjoy dinner with.  Almost intoxicatingly funny and charming.  But she would probably be a disaster to have as a roommate or long-term friend, because she is too self-absorbed by her unquiet mind.    I think this book is EXACTLY like the author. Some people love it for it's charming and vivacious parts.  But other people see past that and really think about the character of the author and find the whole thing to be shallow, self-centered and annoying.

0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle in this book shows that all religions had preached ultimately the same message, quoting ancient and modern spiritual sources supporting his position. There are no abstract theories or arguments but the one simple assertion that the human ego is preventing humankind from realising 'Life's Purpose', which is to be one with the present, NOW.     I was brought up as a Buddhist, but reading Ekhart Tolle, I realised that the concept of 'dukkha' or suffering was very different from the concept as traditionally understood and learnt by me as a child. The Christian concept of 'original sin' and the Hindu concept of 'illusion' (maya) aligned with the Buddhist idea of 'suffering' (dukkha) is seen by Tolle as one of the common 'core insights'(p 8)about the 'dysfunction inherent in the human condition' (p 9).     Tolle then brings the reader to experience 'the breakup of the old egoic mind patterns and the emergence of a new dimension of consciouness.'(p 21). I remember having attended lectures given by Krishnamurthy many years ago, who repeatedly asked us to 'observe the observer within' in order to release ourselves from the grip of the ego. Tolle acknowledges the similarity of their common stance 'regarding the inner alignment with the present moment' (p 199).     Eckhart Tolle is no reclusive 'other-worldly' figure. His description of the University of London Senate House Library chimes well with my own period there as a mature student in the Sixties and later while engaged in postgraduate work in the early Eighties. He says little about what he was reading/studying, but that is immaterial given the central theme of the irrelevancy of such 'mind-forged manacles'.    There is just a hint of his past personal struggles when he talks about the 'pain-body' being 'an awakener' when people '... often reach a point where they feel their life is becoming intolerable, where they can't take any more pain, any more drama'(p 181). He adds,'Some people may feel, AS I DID, that they cannot live with themselves anymore' (my emphasis p 182).      Eckhart Tolle is an enlightened human being whose simple but profound message deserves to be heard and acted upon by every other human being in the world.
B000066HHK|1.0|i think its a good album but its over priced you should get linkin park underground 2.5 instead its a fake but it has all the tracks from linkin park underground 2 and hybrid theory EP and more but still cheaper so dont get this album if you dont mind imports that have more tracks.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|There are not enough words to describe this marvel. It is simply spectacular .The talent, the voice, the grace of Celine and the dancers, musicians; everybody involved in this project is beyond imagination. A show created by Dragone with all the implications that he's huge name has makes this DVD a must have. If you are not a Celine's fan after this you will become one. I never had the opportunity of seen the show live, but now I have the DVD and the opportunity of been in one of the concerts of her next world tour and I'm not going to miss it....
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Superb German film about how people operate within the corrupt and perverted German Democratic Republic 4 years before the fall of the Berlin Wall; some people are just bad like the odious Minister Hempf, others face the fear of a visit from the dreaded Stasi for their activities, while others are forced to inform on their friends, and still others like Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz just make do within a system they don't even believe in.<br />\\"The Lives of Others\\" features a brilliant script from Writer/Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck and equally brilliant direction - every scene contains telling little moments as he draws great performances out of a wonderful cast. Excellent music and production design add to the impact.<br />An altogether exceptional film.
B000VI70X6|5.0|I've been a Shakira's fan since the very beginning of her career. I admire her as a singer and as a person and I believe that Shaki, more than anyone, deserves the recognition she's having right now. I was in the concert and I didn't know they were making a DVD (lucky me!!!!!) It was a surprise when I bought it and I'm very satisfied with both, the spectacle I saw live and now the DVD...I believe is a 5 star and it is much better than the previous tour. Even if you are not a die hard Shakira's Fan, this is one you would like to have. Actually I bought two DVD...one for me and another for my cousin...I gave it to him as a birthday present and he loved it....the bonus CD is also pretty good ;)
B000002KDO|5.0|I recently purchased this having high expectations, and well, this   CD went above and beyond my expectations.    Specific cuts such as \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Lord of this World\\", \\"After Forever\\", \\"Into the Void\\", and \\"Sweet Leaf\\", were amazing. But the other songs were really good to. The songs you don't hear as much about such as \\"Orchid\\" or \\"Solitude\\" were awesome. Every single song on this album was great. Buy it now, you wont be disappointed.
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|This is not a return. This is so weak. Terrible lyrics, forgettable melodies (if you can even find a melody) and songs that just don't breath at all. Fast doesn't translate to interesting. This is right up there with Automatic For The People as one of the worst REM releases in their storied career.
B000002KE2|5.0|Amazing. I am speechless. This kept the creative flow that Black Sabbath, Paranoid, And Master of Reality set. \\"Wheels of Confusion\\", \\"Supernaut\\", \\"Snowblind\\", \\"Cornucopia\\", and \\"Tomorrows Dream\\" are just a few good cuts. However, When listening to \\"Under the Sun\\", I expected another one of Tony's Genius ballad instrumental(Which I cannot stress as to how good they are) But what I listened to was even better. A very sludgy opening riff, and great chord progressing. Buy this. Its a heavy metal essential and cannot be passed up.
1591841992|5.0|I saw the book on the shelf at Borders and the cover caught my attention. I read the first few pages and knew I had to read the rest.<br /><br />I am a technical trainer and writer and have been teaching classes for more than 10 years now. For the last 7 years I've been using a pen tablet in my classes to draw diagrams on-the-fly while lecturing about different technology concepts. The attendees have given phenomenally positive feedback about this learning method.<br /><br />Now, I find this book that not only validates the process I've been using but helps me take it to the next level. The author reveals the four steps to visual thinking and the six problem categories that we all face. He shows you how to do it with case studies and examples that are practical.<br /><br />One thing that I think many will find helpful is the way the author quickly removes any fear of drawing you may have. He gives the testimony of many attendees that he has helped overcome this fear of drawing in front of others. Personally, my family plays Pictionary very regularly because I want my children to be comfortable with this process.<br /><br />My favorite part was the Appendix: The Science of Visual Thinking. I found it very interesting as it presents scientific research as it relates to this simple process.<br /><br />If you want a great new way to solve problems and a great way to communicate ideas, I think you'll find this book very useful.<br /><br />Excellent!
0887307280|4.0|Michael Gerber has written a book that is truly a gift for the entrepreneur and small business owner. His theories, models and recommendations challenge the entrepreneur to step back, separate him/herself from the business, create a realistic business plan and maintain a strategic perspective.     Gerber's insistence that the entrepreneur focus on working ON the business, not just IN the business, is invaluable business advice. Likewise, his clarification of the roles of the business owner -- Technician, Manager and Entrepreneur -- supports entrepreneurs in leveraging their time and resources. Finally, his emphasis on the importance of systems and standardization challenges the entrepreneur's typical orientation towards customization. Using relevant case studies, Gerber shows how systems can be implemented to increase reveneues and improve business operations.    Amidst the many business books on the market, this book stands out by providing entrepreneurs with a realistic plan for creating sustainable businesses and improving the odds of long-term success.

006135323X|5.0|Als doctorandus bedrijfseconomie heb ik ook onderwijs gekregen over de rationaliteit achter de (economische) beslissingen die elk mens zou hebben. Afwegingen worden keurig op nut gewaardeerd, en alles is terug te voeren op de ratio, althans in de bijbehorende modellen met keurige krommen, wiskundige formules en eenvoudige beslisbomen. Zo ongeveer aan de andere kant van het spectrum staat de chaostheorie, in het midden opereert MIT professor Dan Ariely. Na diepgaande beschouwingen toen hij na ernstige brandwonden zelf met de zin van het leven, observaties van de omgeving, en dergelijke geconfronteerd werd, is het boek Predictably Irrational geboren. Ariely toont op basis van diverse onderzoeken, dat de mens allerminst zuiver rationeel handelt, maar dat zijn irrationele gedragingen zeer goed voorspelbaar zijn. De experimenten tonen gevoel voor humor, illustreren alledaagse beslissingen en uitkomsten. Zo blijken we bij seksuele opwinding onze moraal behoorlijk naar beneden bij te stellen, komen we bij 'gratis' aanbiedingen, zeker in combinatie-aanbiedingen al snel in de verleiding toe te happen, en is wetenschappelijk aan te tonen dat een ethiek als de 10 geboden of de ambtseed ons herinnert aan hoe het zou moeten, en direct ons besluitvormingsproces beïnvloedt. Cash stelen vinden we moeilijker dan andere zaken onttrekken aan bijvoorbeeld de baas, het congres of de directe omgeving. Da's even slikken voor producenten, marketeers, ouders, winkeliers, mensen die het niet zo hebben met normen & waarden, verstokte theoretici die nog teveel waarde hechten aan de rationaliteit van de mens.

0156027321|4.0|Delightful.  Everytime I go over this book in my mind I find these extraneous pieces of information that only fit when you've completed the book.  The book is certainly no mystery.      It only takes 96 pages before Pi is stranded at sea.  And 180 pages of it locked into a compromising situation with a Bengal Tiger.  The first 100 feel like a primer on Indian culture and life on first read.  But they lay a foundation.  They make so much of Pi's later behavior believable.    And the last 20 pages?  You're no longer sure which story to believe.  Both are plausible.  Both incredible.  Only one took ten times as many pages to write.    Outstanding.
B000R8YC18|4.0|1976 was a funny electoral year. One year after the full defeat in Vietnam and the evacuation of Saigon on the run. Two years after the resignation of Nixon, to avoid an impeachment that would have led to the very first conviction of the President. 1976 was the year when all had to changed, and nothing really changed because the establishment just looked for a way to save face and restore the everyday standard imperialistic power, and of course that will fail with Jimmy Carter, but Scorsese could not know it though everyone knew that success would be a miracle. What's more, success in that line was doomed in the long run. It was not yet possible to know what was going to happen in China, but we could know it was going to change, even if it was quite clear that the Soviet Union was not going to change at all, even if we could not know the industrialized feudal soviet system was going to fall down the chute, was going to be flushed down the drain. That was what Scorsese meant with his crossroads but he did not know how many roads there were in that crossroads nor where they led nor of course which one to take. But one thing was sure in those days: the US were going to take a road that did not lead to any confrontation with their real historical mission which is to create democracy through freedom in a system that had to improve itself all the time because it knew perfection did not exist in this world, be it only because perfection is divine and cannot be found in a non-divine world, in a human world, what's more in a human sinner's world. It was sure the US were not going to face their historical fate and their inner problems and their inner challenges like for example the racial problem, like for example the education of their young, like for example the control of violence, like for example a health care system that was more than necessary. The film is a vague echo of that particular challenge with the allusion to the welfare system, because that was where the US stood at the time: helping the poor. But Warhol had already exposed that problematic solution by showing in his films how vain, hypocritical and corrupted the welfare system was in the US, and that could not be an objective for the US, an objective they could put in their constitution in the form of a new amendment, the only way to really improve the system is by making it constitutional since then to repeal such an amendment is particularly difficult. But the film has aged tremendously since today the US have reached the end of that road, the bad road they chose in 1976. They are deep in the mud of a new war (the Buddhist have a nice saying about elephant getting caught in mud) that has been rejected by the world from the very start, they are confronted to the emerging of a world power they will have to share responsibilities with sooner or later so let it be now, the famous BRIC, Brazil, Russia, India and China, and that has to be done straight away since that BRIC is already the first economic power in the world and will be the first political power in the world within a few years. What's more the US is deeply agitated by the necessity to finally come to terms with the racial divide and the racial problem, by the obligation to provide all Americans with a full health care system, by the duty to provide every American with the possibility to educate themselves even if the government has to cut the military budget to do that. The good old three objectives of equality, good health and education in a system that would recapture freedom and democracy, both having been impaired and limited in the process of the US negating history in order to impose their own self centered epiphanic power. But what does Scorsese envisioned beyond 1976? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The system was defeated in a way. That's why the film has aged since the US and Americans finally have the chance today to be able to choose the road that would lead to their finally getting to political adultage.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesage.

0143112724|5.0|The book itself will help you sound like a person who knows something. This is a good thing! It's the single best reference for writing correctly and communicating so people will understand you. If you send emails, text messages, keep a blog, or your own website, then you are writing all the time and doing it right will only create a good impression. The art by one of my favorites, Maira Kalman, is a wonderful addition. Keeps you turning the pages and gives a bright image just when you want one.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|In my opinion this DVD is something every human being should see. The beauty and incredibility of this planet we all live on is demonstrated like never before and I guarantee you will want to sit though all four disc and not turn off. You will see many things you have never seen before but also things you have, but in such an incredible way that you will be absolutely in awe. David Attenborough is without doubt the master and his commentary, sprinkled with incredible facts, will leave you thinking how little you know about the world you live in. The years of dedication and unbelievable camera work it obviously required will leave you wondering how was ever achieved. Buy this product, you won't be disappointed.... an absolute bargain in this world of rip-offs.
B000RF1QDI|3.0|Plainly, this movie still sucks narratively, but boy does it look pretty in  High Def.  The premise is way more interesting than the actual direction, and I knew this going in.  I'd already seen this film in the theaters years ago and I remember not liking it much then either.<br /><br />The reason to get this film is as a showcase of my 50\\" Kuro.  The afterlife sequences are simply dazzling.  The color reproduction is better than I remember it looking at the cinema.  Well worth the price.  Look out for the Hell sequence with it's sooty textures.  In the dark, and with a great television, you fail to tell where the rooms blackness ends and the picture begins.<br /><br />Jaws will drop.  Is that reason enough to pick this film up? You decide.
0895260131|5.0|This book exposes the Muslim fanatics for what they are.  After reading this book, there is no question, based on the facts, that these fanatics want to harm the West in their lust for global control.  When one considers the murder of our soldiers and the tragedy that their families face when hearing about the death of a loved one from cold blooded killers, you wise up to the issues that threaten America, and the world as a whole by these fanatics.  You will be dismayed by the facts and will be shocked by the thorough scholarship of Robert Spencer's work.  The books is very lucid in its presentation and rallies irrefutable facts about the dangers that await Americans, and Westerners in general.  America, wake up.  Our mission in the Middle East is a noble one that secures our freedoms and dignity.
0452289963|4.0|In A New Earth Awakening to Your Life's Purpose, Eckhart Tolle has done an excellent job of expanding on his previous most popular work 'Power of Now'. This is one of the best in the series and certainly a great primer for those spiritualists who want to live more in the moment.     The only problem I see for the masses who will read this book and hear him on the Oprah WebCast is the missing element of a clear blueprint that anyone could easily pick up the book and begin immediately and profoundly changing their life without years of searching and meditative practice.    The better work on the subject for those who are really committed to  personal improvement and spiritual change is the newly released 'I Am God: Here's My Message' which has the actual exercises to quickly  transcend you into a state of enlightenment without sifting through all the fancy words and mumbo jumbo.
B000002IZM|5.0|If you have seen the movie, you already know. This is a must have. Vangelis wraps it up into a fine package with additional tracks that don't see the light of the film, but fit perfectly into the soundtrack. Buy it.
6305657947|5.0|This is actually a story retold, and a better version of the original, in my opinion. A sexy acquisitions tycoon (Pierce Brosnan), a beautiful bounty hunter (Rene Russo) and a NY detective (Denis Leary) play their various roles in attempting to capture the deviceful and shrewd thief of an almost priceless masterpiece from the Metropolitan Museum. With the fabulous display of wealth and all that money can buy, the sex and honest romance, and the affective score, I recommend this flick to those looking for entertainment or a visual aide to manifesting exercises...  Enjoy!
B000NJMJGG|2.0|A seriously lame, formulated story. The entire tale is based on believing its ridiculous beginning. The scenes seem to be very much copied from many moments of the Lord of the Rings, way before those movies were made. It's a professional Hollywood film; it has good acting and decent character interaction and tension. The special effects are decent for its time. But still, by the standards of 2008 movie making, it's not a very good film.
6304711905|5.0|I am not a big fan of westerns or Val Kilmer, but this is one of my favorite movies.  It is, hands down, Val Kilmer's best performance; also, the characters are fun, the wit is amusing and the action is packed.  It's a story of a retired family of lawmen (including the legendary Wyatt Earp/Kurt Russell) and friends (Doc Holiday/Val Kilmer) who get roped back into law, the hard way, and the story doesn't end until justice and revenge are meted.  There's love, Latin and loyalty too!  Enjoy!
B000HC2LIK|5.0|This is the one. Buy it. Watch in on a wide-screen. Decide for yourself, is Deckard a replicant...?     How does Roy Batty know Deckard's name...?     Why did Gaff make an oragami unicorn...?
B0010X745K|5.0|when i first rented this movie i was wary of it because i had heard iffy reviews of it when it had showed in the theaters. that just proves that like music or books , everyone has their own tastes. this movie is an amazing example of how stephen king's literature grabs u by the throat and doesnt let go until ur begging for ur nightmare to be over , normally the movie adaptions of his short stories or novels are less than great AKA DREAMCATCHERS<br />but sometimes like this and Children Of The Corn<br />it completely embodies the writing<br />ah....this man is a genius , and should be treated as so :)<br />go rent this if u are on the fence or not<br />its great!
B000JLTR8G|5.0|Wonderfully plotted -- with twists reminiscent of Chinatown -- and beautifully acted, this tale of trust and betrayal, love and obligation encapsulates the spirit of post-WWII Japan and the effects of immersion in a foreign culture on a man (Robert Mitchum).  Believing he is doing a favor for an old friend who has run afoul of the Japanese mob (the Yakuza of the title), Robert Mitchum returns to Japan where he re-experiences his love for a Japanese woman, learns of a friend's lies and betrayals, and pays a heavy price for that discovery.  Ultimately, this movie is not about violence and death -- although there is enough of it to make Quentin Tarantino proud, or envious -- it is, rather, about duty and obligation (in Japanese, 'giri'), and how one comes to assume a duty or an obligation.  A gem.
B0015KO52S|3.0|First off I have to say that I too am a big fan of the White Stripes. I really wanted to like this cd. However I can't even make it through listening to the whole cd. The first song is Great...then to me it goes downhill from there. I was hoping it would be better than their first cd. I am just waiting for another White Stripe cd. And catching Jack perform with the Rolling Stones in Shine a Light.
0609610570|5.0|Literally one of the best business books ever written. The style is tight and clean, and the advice practical and accomplishment oriented.
0452270073|5.0|\\"Regeneration\\" is best read as part of the so-called \\"Regeneration Trilogy,\\" of which it is the first book. (The other two, in order, are \\"The Eye in the Door\\" and \\"The Ghost Road.\\") This way, you will be able to follow the main characters: Dr. W.H.R. Rivers, Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, and Billy Prior (all but the last are historical figures) through all three books. In particular, you'll be able to appreciate the ways in which Barker develops the complex character of Rivers, the psychologist who treats soldiers who have suffered breakdowns and who, before the war, had done fieldwork in Melanesia, studying the cultural practices of a tribe of headhunters. \\"Regeneration\\" is set in Craiglockhart, the psychiatric hospital where Rivers treats Sassoon and Prior. \\"The Eye in the Door,\\" mostly set in London, focuses on the social and economic conditions of British society in the war years, while \\"The Ghost Road\\" shifts among three settings: London, the battlefields in France, and Melanesia. As one reads through the trilogy, characters appear and disappear, but the figures of Rivers and Prior are central---and often antagonistic. I particularly admire the way Barker uses different techniques to illuminate complexity of character and thought, as when, in \\"The Ghost Road,\\" Prior begins to write in a field diary (which he does not do in the first two novels). Some readers of \\"Regeneration\\" have compared Barker to Hemingway, but I don't think so. His technique is spare, but she works like a painter with a large canvas, one who paints panoramas of historic events. Thus, some parts of the canvas are minutely detailed, while others are merely brushed in. The effect, taken as a whole, is stunning and, by the end of \\"The Ghost Road,\\" will reduce you to silence, the way a great painting does.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I had the luxury to see Muse live in Washington DC last year, my son pleaded with me to go see this band I had never heard of (although I did recognize a few songs once I got there). This was the most eye-opening and exciting performance I have seen in a long long time, and this in a year that included a Rush performance as well as two Police events in Stockholm and Washington DC.    Do yourself a favor and find out for yourself why Muse won the Q award for best live act in 2007. It is all here in a glorious production with DTS 5.1 sound. This band has it all. Amazing muscians, Matt Belamy is a certified genius on the guitar, and to top it off, he plays the keyboards as a concert pianist. Amazing vocals, increadibly strong material and a bass/drums backbone second to no other band, maybe with the exception of Rush. But the icing on the cake which makes the act complete is the increadible energy these guys bring to their live events. Live music does not get much better than this.
B000BB14YY|5.0|This reimagining of Shakespeare's King Lear by legendary director Akira Kurosawa is a fine addition to the Criterion Collection.  Majestic in scope, Ran is Kurosawa's last epic masterpiece.  The film is set in sixteenth-century Japan and evinces the folly of war as well as how treachery, greed, and a lust for power destroy a family.  A special edition double-disc set, the second disc offers a number of first-rate supplements, including A.K., a 74-minute film on Kurosawa by Chris Marker, a 30-minute documentary on the making of Ran, and a 35-minute video piece reconstructing Ran through Kurosawa's paintings and sketches.  An excellent 28-page booklet featuring an insightful essay by film critic Michael Wilmington and interviews with Kurosawa and composer Toru Takemitsu is also included.  This film -- particularly this Criterion Collection edition -- is a must for any Kurosawa collector.

B0015KO52S|5.0|Jack White is so influential and popular right now that when he tells the record company that he wants this album released on a certain date or else he is going elsewhere...it happens!<br /><br />Sometimes a rushed release date has its drawbacks such as mistakes in the packaging or poor sound quality.  However, this album is superb in every way!  The album artwork is cool with the retro photograph, the sound quality is great (the opening guitar sounds massive), and the songs are all well written and recorded.<br /><br />I cannot top the other reviews here going into a whole lot of detail on the songs etc, but I have listened to the album all the way through at least 4 times.  It is a little more rockin' than the first release.  The guitars sound great (probably recorded really raw with an old tube amp and a microphone).  It is a great album!  If you like The White Stripes or The Raconteurs 1st album, then pick this one up...you won't be disappointed!
B0013XS8A2|5.0|I own all Mike Oldfield's titles and i rank this as 2nd or 3rd, above just are, perhaps, ommadawn or incantations. Also, i would call it tubular bells 4 ENHANCED. Hayley Westenra: Bueatiful girl and great voice. Lang Lang: what can i say about this pianist? He's a virtuos of piano. The orchestra sounds just like Wiener Philharmoniker or Berliner Philharmoniker, but credit   of conductor is missed. No matter this fact, it's a great, great album!!! So, actually i rank it as 1st M. Olfield's album.

B0010X8NF0|4.0|Wes Anderson films are an acquired taste. From [[ASIN:0767821408 Bottle Rocket]], [[ASIN:6305428239 Rushmore]], [[ASIN:B000067DHK The Royal Tenenbaums]], [[ASIN:B0007UC8Y4 The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]], and finally this film, THE DARJEELING LIMITED, quirkiness is a theme that runs throughout writer/director Anderson's repertoire. He also loves working with the Wilson brothers (Luke and Owen) as well as Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray. So -- not surprisingly -- Owen, Anjelica and Bill all show up at some point in this one. They are, in fact, becoming what I like to call \\"the quirky cadre.\\"<br /><br />Anderson isn't one of those \\"in-your-face\\" kind of directors. He doesn't spoonfeed you anything, and this is both fun and frustrating. The fun comes from personal discoveries related to the scenes and situations he puts his characters in. The frustration is that sometimes the disconnects are too extreme.<br /><br />This time we have the three Whitman brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson, [[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars]]), Peter (Adrien Brody, [[ASIN:B000KWZ7JC Hollywoodland]]), and Jack (Jason Schwarztman, [[ASIN:B000M06KJ8 Marie Antoinette]]). Their father has recently passed away and the brothers take on a trip to India to find their absent mother. In the meantime, we get to witness the bizarreness of this family unit. Francis (Wilson) is a control freak who has to have every minute detail pinned down. Peter (Brody) is somewhat of a kleptomaniac. And Jack (Schwartzman) is a damaged guy stuck on a damaged gal (played by Natalie Portman, [[ASIN:B0007OCG4W Closer]]). The three boys try to rediscover their brotherly bonds by taking The Darjeeling Limited (a train) across India in search of their father's hopes for them and their mother's reasons for not attending her husband's funeral. There are some absolutely hysterical, funny, and poignant moments, sometimes all wrapped up in one scene. The one that comes to mind the most is when the brothers witness a raft trapped in some rapids with three boys clinging on for dear life. They put aside all of their differences and go into savior mode without thinking, and it is a defining moment within the brothers' lives. What comes after is funny and sad. They finally break free of their bonds to their parents and leave all of their luggage behind (literally and metaphorically), thanks to the families they meet outside their own.<br /><br />The main frustration most viewers might have with the movie is the music. There really is no connection between what is happening and the tunes (Anderson, I believe, just enjoyed the Indian music and decided to incorporate it into the film, and be damned what anyone might think). The extreme disconnect was very bothersome for this viewer.<br /><br />Even so, this is a good quirky Anderson film with great color shots (the train and the surrounding terrain), an uplifting story (in the end), and some fine acting by all (especially by Owen Wilson).oys clinging on for dear life.

B0013BNY2Q|4.0|Sampling is the best way to tell if you like this release. I think this is a good CD, not really like any other they have released. It is mostly electric and loud with a few accoustic moments thrown in -  not near as dense, wearing or wall-of-sound as Monster. While many are waiting for Automatic for the People II, this is not at all like that but it is still very good. If you like REM, I believe you will like this one.
B00132D808|4.0|...to find a disc of this caliber these days.  PATD's second outing is full of catchy tunes that will sound familar, yet new, almost instantly.  Take a liberal dose of The Beatles and Jellyfish and add in some unexpected twists of style not unlike the side roads that artists like Rufus Wainwright and the late Harry Nilson have taken, and your in for a great listen.  It may seem a bit of a sloppy mix at first - pure pop nuggets interspersed with a campy 1930's style crooner here, some sweet ballads there, and lots of clever, loopy lyrics, but after a few spins you may have a hard time hitting the stop button. I know I am.     My only complaint is that some of the chorus lines (which are full of hooks) are sometimes repeated a few to many times.  They seem a bit labored at first, but I got over it pretty quickly. Its a minor complaint when you have a disc a fun as this. Can't wait for the next release....

It arrived a few days later and I now have a new hobby.  I make a cookie recipe a week and just love it!!  So far I've tried the Thin and Crispy Chocolate Chip Cookies, The Chocolate Thumbprints and the Macaroons.  Every recipe is easy to follow and make and the results are amazing.  I highly recommend this for your cookbook shelf and even as gifts for birthdays and holidays.  You could even bake a batch and make it a package gift of cookies and cookbook!!!
B000OV170W|5.0|This was the first of I hope many Picoult books to read. She has a way of telling the story that kept me so intent on turning the pages! It was an amazing read, and I am not an avid reader and this book was finished in days, I just couldn't put it down. Her insight into the characters is amazing, although I wish there was more about some, but to keep the book at a good length she did well. I hope to find her others as well written as this one!
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I loved Mary Poppins when I was young, my daughter was absolutely taken with it when she was 2, and now my granddaughter watches it at least three times a day.  This movie is magical classic.
B000ETQPYM|4.0|This book came recommended from a friend to read, since I am into Picoult books. I did not know that there was a movie based on the book, and from what I have heard about it I dont want to see the movie, for fear that it will ruin the compassion that I have for the characters. The book was rather easy to read and the story held my interest. I was however disappointed in the ending. I dont want to spoil it, but it wasn't the way that I had expected from the build up of the characters. I would read Cecelia Ahern's other books based on this one. It was captive and moving. I was more interested in the fact that the author was very young when she wrote this and captured the situation and subject matter better than any person at that age can. I would recommend anyone to read this book, it is heartwarming and moving.
B000YENUI6|5.0|I was very intrigued by the subject matter of this film,The Russian mafia has rarely been depicted in film, There is some graphic violence during the first part of the film so it may not be suitable for children under 17. Viggio Mortisen doing a rather convincing Russian accent plays a hard as nails member of the mafia who has a secret, and tries to help a young nurse searching for some family of a young girl who has died in childbirth at the hospital where she works, her only clues come from the girls diary. It ended leaving a few unanswered questions,I think I feel a sequel coming on.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|this is a great album.  it was a nice move for the black keys to do something like this instead of another straight up blues/rock album.  this album still maintains the black keys blues/rock flavor, but with an added danger mouse \\"spice\\".  i heard that Ike Turner was meant to be a part of this album, but he passed away before that could be realized.  that would have been very interesting to say the least.  but back to the review of what is, and not what might have been- i know there will be a few reviews on here that will say something like \\"they changed\\" or something to that effect but the truth is, they went in a new direction and did something fresh.  they have 4+ albums of the best damn blues/garage/rock ever made, and this new piece is a great addition.  if they had made another straight up blues/rock album, then there would be folks saying things like \\"they should have done something different\\" so what can you do?  i am going to hate myself for writing this, but this album reminds me A LITTLE of when the white stripes put out satan get behind me.  ONLY because there are some new elements/instruments (moog/synth, banjo, woodwind/flute?, keys, hand claps, etc) on this album that may influence some fans to refer to this album as slightly experimental.  i'm having a hard time putting my thoughts into words, and perhaps i should have waited a few days to post a review, but if you like the black keys, you will like this album.  and even if you don't end up digging it, spend the ten bucks and support these guys.  they are some of the few who are doing it right these days.  i've been a fan since the beginning (the big come up) and i truly dig this album.  long live the black keys.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|...but not so much for the rest of us.<br /><br />This is one of those \\"deep, meaningful\\" films, full of angst and the baring of tortured souls.  It shows the true meaninglessness of life.  It takes a truly enlightened soul to gather the full meaning of every nuanced moment.<br /><br />In short, it's one of those art house flicks that most people avoid like the plague.  It's not at all surprising that the critics liked it, and the fans didn't.<br /><br />So, why three stars for a movie that, quite frankly, I hated?  Because for what it is, it was well done.  It had some beautiful camera work, and while I'm not a big fan of the genre, I know some folks are.<br /><br />This is not a film for mindless entertainment after a hard day.  Getting to know the characters will take some effort, and without that the movie falls very flat.<br /><br />This movie did very poorly at the box office, and I would say that at least part of the reason is that the director made a nuanced, psychological movie, and the publicity folks marketed a science fiction action/adventure movie.<br /><br />As a science fiction movie, it required way too much \\"willful suspension of disbelief\\", and the action/adventure was erratic at best.  Anyone that took general science back in junior high would find it laughable, and action fans would have walked out before there was any.<br /><br />Sci/fi is just the medium here, not the message.  The problems arise when you start it up, expecting science fiction and get an art house flick in space.<br /><br />Action/adventure fans will be disappointed, and art house movie fans won't ever see it, because of the way the publicity was handled.<br /><br />As I said, the critics liked it.  I can understand why.  After walking in expecting the third or fourth meaningless hack-em-up for the week, this would be a welcome relief.  Too bad most of the folks that would like this film will never see it.

1402555989|5.0|I purchased this book on tape because it is read by Hugh Laurie, not because I was familiar with the author. What a pleasant surprise and delight to hear. It was very educational in that it has given me a new way to look at things - as an autistic person would, since the story is from the perspective of an autistic 15-year-old boy. His mother is dead and he lives with his father. One of his teachers has encouraged him to write a book and when he finds the dog across the street dead, with a garden fork sticking out of his body, he decides to write a book about his uncovering the mystery of who murdered the dog. In the process of doing his investigation, he talks to strangers (which he normally would never do) and incurs the anger of his father (which he does not understand). One mystery turns into others: why is his father angry?, why can't he talk to the owner of the dog?, why can't he ask the questions he asks?, what is the a secret his father is keeping from him? It is also interesting to see how others treat the boy and which approaches work and which don't work. It is interesting to \\"see\\" inside the mind of an autistic person. There are a lot of peculiarities in the book, and my favorite is the chapter numbers. The book starts with chapter 2, which made me think I missed something, but it turns out that the boy loves prime numbers, so he gives each chapter a prime number. I think anyone would get a lot out of this book.
B0015RFCZ0|1.0|this was the worst movie ever!!!!!  its been a week since I watched the movie and I still hate it!  there was nothing interesting or believable about that stupid movie!  it was slow moving and terrible.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|First off, I would like to say that this film might be mildly entertaining for someone who has never read the book, Northanger Abbey, by Jane Austen. However, having read the book, I find this BBC adaptation a poor substitute. The film cuts out so much of the plot and action. The action it does not cut out, it changes or summarizes. For the BBC to have done the book justice would have required at least 200 minutes. Instead,the film is compacted into about 90 minutes.<br /><br />  In fact, I enjoyed the Wishbone children's television 30 minute edition more than this one. The emphasis of this BBC film seemed to be into making General Tilney a villain with horrible habits rather than merely a villain in Catherine's eyes. Furthermore, the film makes Catherine too gothic in my opinion. The music and seens all appear too hastily create, with poor action and an extremely modern-gothic setting.<br /><br />  Futhermore, many of the secondary characters are hardly even developed. While I generally enjoy the BBC versions of Charles Dickens' and Jane Austen's works, this BBC work is flawed. Unlike many BBC productions, (ex: Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensibility, Emma)I would not want to show this to a class of students for fear of them coming away with the wrong themes and motifs.
B0014BECF8|4.0|The past couple of years have been a bit difficult on George Michael. With problems with substance abuse, and invasions of his personal life, it has been one difficult ride from the fallen star. Though his career has fizzled in America the past several years, his music has recently taken a turn with the success of the ABC show Eli Stone. With his songs like Faith being shown and showcased on the show, his voice has been introduced slowly but surely to a whole new generation. Even though he still hasn't made it big in America, he still has shown it by being a status symbol all throughout Europe. But last year, he celebrated his 25th anniversary of being a recording icon, and has shown it on a new greatest hits album for American audiences. But, is this something worth having Faith with?<br /><br />Twenty Five, the 2006 greatest hits album from George Michael which was widely released overseas, has finally made its 2008 American debut for listeners. The collection though focuses on his mainly his overseas success, and not as much on his status with American hard core fans. The collection falls similar to George's 1998 hits album Ladies & Gentlemen: The Best Of George Michael, as a double-album of his classics, one being of his top dance songs, the other by being about his somber but classic ballads. The collection throws in a few surprises, one of them bringing in more of his mainstream hits during his era as a part of Wham! during the 80's with classics like Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go!, Last Christmas and the somber Careless Whisper. The collection also includes his classics from both sides of the Atlantic, including his mainstream radio standards like Freedom '90, the deep and delicate Jesus To A Child, as well as the #1 smashes Father Figure, Faith and Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me with Elton John. The collection also highlights a few new tracks here including a cover of the Stevie Wonder classic As with Mary J. Blige, which has made its official U.S. debut after being a hit overseas 10 years ago, as well as the delicate and intimate This Is Not Real Love, and a collaboration of his song Heal The Pain with Paul McCartney. While the album highlights in his new songs as well as some fan favorites the album does overlook a few of George's great #1 hits from his 80's era like the provocative I Want Your Sex, Monkey and his classic I Knew You Were Waiting For Me with the legendary Aretha Franklin.<br /><br />While Twenty Five isn't as definitive as Ladies & Gentlemen: The Best Of George Michael, it still is a decent buy for hard core fans of George throughout the years who still enjoy his melodies, and works nicely as a sample for anyone who doesn't at all own any George Michael album to date. While there have been so many greatest hits albums that haven't worked that well the past few years, Twenty Five by George Michael is a good addition to your album collection, and that is something is is of a decent value from a father figure.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-a hit overseas 10 years ago, as well as the delicate and intimate This Is Not Real Love, and a collaboration of his song Heal The Pain with Paul McCartney.

0345456343|5.0|This review is for this particular edition.     I love that the first three (and argueably best) books of the Vampire Chronicles were combined with sleek and well designed cover art. The cover was actually taken from the short-lived Broadway musical, 'Lestat', and this was made as an obvious merchandise tie in. It was nice to see, nonetheless.     It's of a much better quality than the mass market paperback versions and a better deal at $13, since each mass market edition will cost you about $7. The book itself is rather heavy (about 4 lbs), so if you have weak wrists it may be a struggle for you to hold, but text is large and easy to read, the ink does not smudge like the mass market editions do, and the pages are thin and smooth.     If you're contemplating 'plunging into the stream' (the words that the Vampire Lestat himself 'lives' by) by giving Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles a try, than buy this particular version. I can't recommend it enough.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Certainly reminiscent of Norah Jones, perhaps a bit jazzier, but after several listenings I am buying it for my friends.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Those who have written reviews for this movie of anything less than 5 stars have NO idea what it means to be lower than low, at the absolute bottom with no visible way out. You see, in order to understand the struggle, you have to have LIVED it. I understand this movie because I HAVE lived it. Some other review cited that it took far too long to display the epic struggle that left us no time to relish the moment of success. I submit that were it not for the INTENSE struggle he faced, there would BE no reason to celebrate his ultimate success. It would have less meaning. I have NEVER cried so hard as I did at the end of this movie. During the course of the film, you FEEL his pain of wanting to be just that little bit more than what he felt himself to be. You yearn for him to experience that one bit of happiness to know that he doesn't HAVE to sell his blood anymore to make a few bucks to be able to fix a light in a bone density scanner he sells to provide a meal and a place to live for a few weeks for himself and his son. This man went through more tribulations than any of the other reviewers here have seen in their own lives or the family and friends that surround them. If you want to see a film that TRULY lifts you up by the climax, see the pursuit of happyness, and IGNORE the many discouraging reviews from people who have no clear understanding of personal anguish and eventual triumph. Will Smith would be hard pressed to ever again be handed a script for a more heart wrenching and satisfying movie. 5 stars +++
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I bought these about 3 years ago to replace the K240M that I had. The K240M had several issues - its 600 ohms impedance, and the non-replaceable cable.<br /><br />For some reason, my cats love AKG headphones and kept chewing the cord.<br />This K240s was a godsend . I bought them and 5 replacement cords. I'm down to the last one. I keep forgetting to pack them in my drawer after use.<br /><br />I have hundreds of cables in my house between my computer, home theater, home recording studio, and my cats only chew these, for some reason.<br /><br />Also, the sound quality is insanely great and accurate. I have been using these recently to monitor recordings . These are more revealing than any speakers ever will be. Last saturday I recorded a harpsichord. I had 2 pairs hooked up to the recording station, including these. The other was a Sony 700DJ heapdhone. The Sony's sounded really dead. Like something was off. Too much bass, not enough treble. There was no mistaking the accuracy of the playback of the AKG, since I was sitting right next to the instrument and performer. It was almost like the real thing.<br /><br />I see that these have dropped quite a bit in price since I bought them. At this price I might just have to get a second pair.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a wonderful story. My family loves it! It gets better each time we watch it. I would highly recommend it. We really like movies of this time period and this is one of the best we have seen. I am so glad that I purchased it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The show has an interesting appeal. Just to put the show in as few words as possible and still be effective: The characters are all likeable. The story is suspenseful. The show is well written. The action is nice. The locals are creative and alive. The deepness of space, the psychopathic characters that make appearances and the dialogue sometimes combine and really bring this show to a new level of entertainment. not just a good story and likeable characters. If you have a chance to watch this show, watch it!
B000000H8B|5.0|my god what a brutal metal album. this album is for true metal fans. max and igor in their prime. anyone who has never heard them needs to check it out they are the real deal. if you like this check out roots and chaos a.d. then go get the brand new cavelero conspiracy the brothers reunited.
B0013D8LOU|4.0|I was intrigued by this film...I didn't expect to like it, but found myself unable to tear myself away.  Johnny Depp surprised me with his singing talent.  Unfortunately, Helena's accent was so strong, I couldn't understand a word she was singing, but could understand the meaning of her words by her actions, for the most part.  It's a dark film, obviously...not only because Tim Burton had his hand in it.  The gore is lessened by the fact that it looks fake, so I could handle it ok.  I was a bit afraid it would be too bloody, but it truly wasn't, because of the fake appearance of the blood.  Sweeney was wronged, and you feel yourself hoping he gets his justice, but his revenge overpowered him, made him beastly, and your sympathy isn't long lived.  He becomes that which he hates...lowering himself and basking in his hatred.  However, that's all part of the story...and a rich story it is...revenge, lust, love, longing...it's all there, and you are sure to enjoy.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|These guys are probably the best stadium concert act in the world today.  This dvd is in widescreen format and has PCM Stereo 2.0 and DTS 5.1 Surround audio options (No Dolby 5.1 surround).  It is an NTSC, region 0 dvd which will play in US dvd players.  Great performance and a well directed dvd.  This is a great band in their prime.  Some of this dvd you can preview at muse.mu and get a taste of the show.  It doesn't replicate the thrill of seeing Muse in concert, but it comes close.

B0016679JW|5.0|The sound of a band having fun and making an album from their gut and not their head.  All the turgid, plodding chamber-pop of the past few albums has boiled off and given way to 35 minutes of greatness.  Yes, you will hear the sounds of REM form 20 years ago in here, but that does not mean that this is a re-tread of the past -- it is the sound of a band older but wiser enough to know when to let it all go and trust in themselves to make a great album.
B00005JPTK|3.0|I Am Legend by Richard Matheson has to be one of the most frightening books ever written in the 1950's. But it seems all of the theatrical renditions of this movie have not hit the point of it's clever title. In \\"The Last Man on Earth,\\" \\"The Omega Man,\\" and the recent \\"I Am Legend,\\" all Neville characters are portrayed to be legends of men- the Last man ever to live on Earth.     However, the book's true meaning has been warped in all three motion pictures,(though I have to say \\"The Omega Man\\" is, sorta, the closest). The novel's Robert Neville is not a legend among men, but among Vampires. As the crowd of vampires look fearfully up at him as he is about to be executed, the author describes that Neville was really like a vampire to them- Coming during their resting hour to slaughter them during their sleep, just as a vampire would a man. See the connection?    Over all, if I had not read the book afterward, 2007's \\"I Am Legend\\" was entertaining, suspensful, and, I'll admit, a bit frightening. But I'm afraid that too many people would not have understood the real meaning of the film had it been made directly according to the book. Maybe that's why.
0307237702|5.0|The real Audacity for me is the fluency and style of the writing; I will seriously recommend this book. Well done Obama (not Osama) for sticking to your name and heritage. Power to you and the election!
0810994739|2.0|I read most of this book to my 7th and eighth grade classes. I could not help noticing how selfish Greg was: nothing was his fault; he was always looking for a way out of a tough situation. There is really nothing redeeming about his character. The book, however, has some really funny parts.

B000Q6GUW0|4.0|From his Six Feet Under days I've been a fan of Michael C Hall and had high hopes for Dexter.  I was not disappointed.  This is an excellent, original and very well executed series.      The DVD boxset is OK.  It could be better and include more features, but I suppose I can't complain for the price.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|If you enjoy taking philosophical journeys when experiencing a film, then you'll love this movie.

B000002UAR|5.0|The Fab Four continued experimenting in the Abbey Road studio which they prefered to do and this became their finest work to date. In fact, during what turned out to be their last tour in the US, they didn't perform any songs from this album because the songs were now more complex. If you're a Beatles fan and/or a rock fan, this album is truly essential.    TAXMAN-One of George's stronger compositions talking about one of life's inescapable realities.    ELEANOR RIGBY-Paul's tale about a lonely spinster.    I'M ONLY SLEEPING-Featuring backwards guitars, it's John \\"dreaming his life away\\"    LOVE YOU TO-A song by George featuring all Indian music as the rhythm track.    HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE-A ballad by Paul.    YELLOW SUBMARINE-Written by Paul and sung by Ringo, this became one of their most popular chart toppers.    SHE SAID SHE SAID-John said this came from an encounter with an actor who told him he knew what it's like to be dead.    GOOD DAY SUNSHINE-A feel good song written by Paul.    AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING-A composition of John's that he didn't think much of.    FOR NO ONE-A song by Paul featuring a clavichord and french horn solo.    DOCTOR ROBERT-John's song about drugs and pills.    I WANT TO TELL YOU-The piano and Ringo's hard drum playing highlight this George song.    GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE-Is this Paul song about a girl or about drugs? Either way it's one of the best cuts here. Capitol released this as a single in '76.    TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS-This still sounds amazing four decades later. Even though it's the album's last track, it was the first song recorded. In 1980, John said he took a phrase that Ringo said as the title \\"to take the edge off the heavy, philosophical lyrics.\\"

B00000255F|5.0|Okay so maybe my Springsteen bias is showing, and those in the \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" \\"Pet Sounds,\\" \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" and \\"Rumours\\" camps will all have valid arguments, but the list is a small one.<br /><br />This was the true definition of the \\"wall of sound.\\"  Each song taking the listener on a journey.  All one needs to do is close their eyes when listening and listen to the expressive music and lyrics of each song and you can almost picture yourself there...the hope and desperation still bleed through.<br /><br />Those who may not know the Springsteen catalog well...give it a listen.  Chances are you have heard every song on the album played on the radio.  That and there is no better opening song on any album than \\"Thunder Road\\"  I think it is his finest composition.

B000001FS3|5.0|This album was released over twenty years ago, I was in college when it broke, and in this era where actual musical talent is no longer required to get someone on MTV...this CD is still a work of art.    A sonic departure from their earlier works, Tree builds upon the European sound of \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" and adds an American R&B simplicity to it.  The hits from the the first side of the album are well documented...but the real magic here is on side 2...well from \\"Red Hill Mining Town onward for the CD generation.  \\"Town\\", \\"Trip Through Your Wire\\", \\"Exit\\" are remarkable tunes and \\"One Tree Hill\\" might be the best song U2 has ever laid down (perhaps only eclipsed by \\"One\\")    This is one of the classic albums of the eighties without a doubt, and of our generation.
B000000WFF|4.0|I listened to the Spice Girls when I was a young teenager. This CD brings back memories. However, I'm not really sure how today's teenagers will react to this CD. The music is dated to the middle to late 1990s.

I begin to understand the meaning of \\"DINAMIC ART\\" that means the secuence of actions are drawed step by step, and of course gives you an excellent piece of pop art. The story has a lot of twist that will blow your mind. I want to see the movie because I think is going to be really difficult to make.

B000YPUF9W|5.0|This movie is beutifully shot, there are several screens in this movie that would make great still photographs. The sound, and music score is great, the pacing is great, the characters are great. The zombie effects are the best of all 3 of the movies. This movie has a The Hill have eyes, Mad Max Feel to it, there is even an aweseome sequence where they pay homage the Alfred Hitchcocks \\"The Birds\\" with zombie Crows/Ravens, and its done dam good.  As usual Mila Jovavich's acting is perfect for the role, and she does her own fight scenes, and stunts, how many ex super models can do this? Its a rare treat indeed.  Great Job guys, I keep going back and watching this one over and over. Fans of this Genre of Movies will love this one.
B00005R24G|3.0|This brilliant play can't be faulted for not holding up on repeated viewings once the tricks are known, but the all too faithful film doesn't help things.  Surely some text could have been set aside for the sake of brevity.  Olivier devours the set with enthusiasm.  He throws in every manner in his storied arsenel save credible menace.  He's fascinating to watch but tiring.  An almost visibly bemused Caine bests him at each step.<br />The best part of the DVD is the interview with the play's author that provides a witty history of the stage and screen versions.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|So Michael Stipe is 48 years old?  Doesnt sound like it here.  And Mike Mills and Peter Buck both sound excited to be in a ROCK band again.  Being beaten over the head with guitars has rarely felt this good.  Sure, Stipe still tends to get a little preachy about politics, but that is who he is and at least he is fervently honest.  He doesnt pick up a cause just because its cool.    The entire album spits anger and dismay about where we are and occasionally suggests where we need to be.  The grinding and infectious rocker that opens the album, \\"Living well Is the Best Revenge\\"  sounds better than anything off of Monster.  \\"Until The Day is Done\\" is a brooding and pensive acoustic number that ranks up there with \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Drive\\"  off of \\"Automatic for the People\\".  \\"Hollow Man\\"  alternates between a slow, keyboard driven pace and more anthemic, guitar driven choruses and features some of Stipe's best vocals.  My only complaint is that many of the songs are short (5 are under 3 minutes).  The last song...I'm Gonna DJ...features a sarcastic look at the end similar to \\"Its The End of the World As We Know It\\" only a tad more angry.  This song is one of the shorter numbers that I wish was about a minute longer...but maybe thats the point.  Overall, I think there a few REM cd's better than this one: Murmur, Automatic, Reckoning, Fables, and MAYBE Green.  I also think New Adventures in HiFi had more good songs than people give it credit for.  Accelerate is a very good CD but Im not sure if it will be considered an REM classic..we will need about a year to figure that out.  But 2008 so far has given us a lot of great music releases from bands we still need to hear from, and this is no exception.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is definitely a very charming movie and gem not to be missed.  However, I would not encourage this for those looking for a \\"musical\\" or a sappy romantic film.  It follows the path of an young Irishman still feeling the pain of loss from the breakup with his girlfriend.  A young Czech immigrant encounters him playing guitar on the streets of Dublin, befriends him and they build a bond centered on music and their passion for it.  I won't give away any more details aside from that basic plotline.<br /><br />Suffice to say, all aspects of this film fit together perfectly.  The film is shot in a very low budget fashion, capturing both the grittiness and revival of Dublin.  The acting is first rate, both lead and supporting cast and the music is both a perfect complement to the characters relationship and the overall tone and feel of the filmmaking.  And most importantly the film doesn't follow deliver a contrived Hollywood ending.
B00005JPNY|2.0|If great CGI is enough for you, then this is your movie. I just can't help but notice that the substance of the movie is an almost well-masked DUNE rip-off. We have brass/gadget technology, seekers, a girl whom the witches prophecied to be the one, the evil older female who denies the possibility the girl is the same one prophesied by the witches. The Egyptians are the Fremen. The dust is the spice. I could go on. Add this to the familiers via Harry Potter and a poorly written script and you've got a disaster of a movie.

B000B19BCG|3.0|Supergrass have never made a bad album, that's clear enough. But to me personally 'Road To Rouen' is their least satisfying (for want of a better word) one. I can't really put my finger on why and/or I'm not sure if it just the Supergrass template influencing me too much here.<br /><br />This is definitely not a Bad album, i mean i listened to it again just a few days ago to reacquaint myself with it and I sadly got the same feelings from it as i always have. It seems to not really go anywhere for me, seems to slow burn and nothing close to full. It has nine songs and even one of them is a bit goofy and not really a song. It just kind of made me think that if they only had eight proper songs then it may have been better to leave. Maybe.<br /><br />Having said all that i do really like 'Low C', it has a lovely chorus. And even the goofy song i mentioned before is fun. But not a song.<br /><br />If you're new to Supergrass I'd strongly suggest 'I Should Coco' or even if you have the one album by them and wanting to check out another album i'd reccomend 'Supergrass' their 3rd album (they are my two favs :)<br /><br />All in all Road To Rouen is good but probably their least striking album.
B00012FXAE|3.0|Aliens: The Director's Cut (James Cameron, 1986)<br /><br />Back in the day, when both the Alien franchise and James Cameron were good, the two got teamed up on the first sequel to Ridley Scott's classic. And ever since, fanboys and critics have been arguing over whether Alien or Aliens is the better film. That's pretty damned impressive for a sequel, especially a sequel that was not only not directed by the same director, but a sequel that was directed by the guy who had helmed Piranha II: The Spawning. (Which is, in my mind, still James Cameron's best movie.) Some time later, after James Cameron had become a Hollywood A-lit demideity to rival Steven Spielberg, and Alien had grown into a four-film series whose marketers were incapable of remembering the word \\"quartet\\", both had the muscle to get Cameron's director's cut of Aliens released. It will not be argued over by critics. Maybe fanboys, but not critics.<br /><br />I grant you, as with many director's cuts, most of what is put back in is five seconds here, five seconds there, and every once in a while an interesting minute-or-two scene. (There's an entire, if very minor, subplot involving Ripley's daughter that was excised from the theatrical release; while it's nice to see it back in, it really doesn't do thing one for Ripley's character development, which is probably why it got tossed in the first place.) And most of that is worthwhile. There is, however, one extended scene that's an absolute killer, and should teach kiddies the value of editing staff on a film crew. About half an hour into the movie (in the theatrical release, it comes between Ripley facing the committee who suspends her license and what has always been one of my favorite shots in the movie, the cigarette burned down to its stub in Ripley's fingers), we see a scene at the base before the aliens come and say hey. People going on, living their lives, etc., and a family of folks (Newt's family, natch) heading out to salvage the spacecraft because they've had a communique from Earth that there might be something interesting there. Why does excising this scene make Aliens: The Theatrical Cut such a better film? Well, first, because all the nuggets of information we are given here are also given later in the film. (Though it was nice to see another shot of the derelict spaceship from the original film.) Mostly, however, it's because when we see the base for the first time after the alien attack, we don't know it. We're seeing it for the first time with the marines. The suspense and tension in that scene are pitch-perfect. But if you've seen the base beforehand and gotten an idea of its layout, it's a case of \\"oh, yeah, we've been here before.\\" It just ain't the same, you know?<br /><br />One thing it does do, however, is show that the James Cameron we got to know in the late nineties, who makes bloated, silly, unwatchable movies like True Lies and Titanic, was always there. He just had better teams behind him. (I should add that since Cameron went exclusively into the world of documentaries, he's reacquired the lean-and-mean approach, and they're a whole lot better than True Lies and Titanic.) So I can see value in this, but from the perspective of the movie itself, there's no contest: the theatrical release is way, way better. ** ½a communique from Earth that there might be something interesting there.

B000LC4ZF8|4.0|When it was first released in 1988, \\"Big\\" instantly became one of my favorite films. 20 years later, I can still say the same thing. This film not only \\"holds up\\" well, it is still a timeless classic. It is the story of 12 year old Josh Baskin, who wishes he were \\"big\\" after being humiliated at a carnival for not being tall enough to ride an attraction in front of the classmate that he has a crush on. His wish is granted by the arcade machine, Zoltar, and the next morning, he wakes up as a 30 year old (Tom Hanks). He's kicked out of the house by his mother, who thinks he is a pervert who has broken in. To make matters worse, he can't reverse the wish for at least another 30 days. On the advice of his best buddy, Billy (Jared Rushton), he gets a job in New York City to pass the time and earn some money to live on. Josh quickly moves up the ladder at MacMillan Toy Company, and also attracts the attention of Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins), who has made a habit of sleeping with the new up-and-coming executives. The longer he inhabits his 30-year old body, the more he grows away from his childhood buddy, Billy. However, the day of reckoning eventually comes when he must make a choice.<br /><br />Hanks & Perkins give outstanding performances; instead of \\"playing\\" a 12 year old, Hanks actually becomes one. His innocence is totally believable. Perkins plays the part of the ambitious Susan to perfection, and she is the perfect love interest for Hanks. Talk about chemistry!<br /><br />This 2-Disc Edition gives you 2 versions of the movie; one is the theatrical version, and the other is an Extended Cut (note: NOT a director's cut...just an extra 20 minutes or so added back in). Skip the extended version; it adds nothing, and if anything slows the pacing down and adds sub plots that are meaningless (example: Billy's shrewish mother, played by Frances Fisher). The picture is wonderful; good detail and color. The sound is extremely disappointing. A 2 channel stereo mix? Where's the 5.1? In this day and age, hard to believe they couldn't have put together a nice surround mix for this one. It would really be fantastic in the Billy Idol limo scene!<br /><br />There is an interesting \\"commentary\\" track by the writers/creators of \\"Big,\\" Gary Ross & Anne Spielberg. Although extremely interesting, this would have been better as an audio-only supplement. A nice commentary that corresponds with the picture by director Marshall or Hanks would have been better. The track consists of current interviews with Ross & Spielberg (yes, Steven's sister) who introduce vintage audio tapes that they made while they brainstormed the idea of what would become \\"Big.\\" The tapes do not correspond to what you see on your screen. Yes, it is interesting, but after awhile, it gets somewhat annoying having to listen to Gary continually talk over Anne and not letting her ideas be heard. It does appear that much of the movie that we know and love came from Anne, who quietly (and thankfully) persisted with her vision.<br /><br />Disc 2 includes deleted scenes with commentary by director Penny Marshall. For one of her first movies, she does an excellent job. As did Anne, she had a vision of what the film and especially Hanks' performance should be and she stuck with it, despite the risks (example: at least 3 other age-change movies were ready for release before \\"Big\\" would be finished). There are a number of featurettes: \\"Big Beginnings\\", \\"Chemistry of a Classic\\", AMC Backstory, \\"The Work of Play,\\" and \\"Carnival Party Newswrap\\" (a vintage film showing the wrap party for \\"Big.\\"). There is a fair amount of overlap in all the extras, as Marshall, Ross, and Spielberg are the main contributors. Still, plenty of interesting tidbits; we came this close to seeing Robert DeNiro in the lead role. It is also interesting to hear the young stars of the film, David Moscow (young Josh) and Jared Rushton, discuss the filming. Perkins also gives some fun insights as well. Theatrical trailer and TV Spots round out this edition.<br /><br />Overall, a nice set, but there is definitely room to grow for the next outing of this classic film.dition.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|I certainly didn't have high expectations for this movie when I rented it. Several people informed me that it was terrible and not worth renting. I disagree with them and perhaps it was their setting low expectations that enabled me to enjoy it more. I never read the novel, so I can't compare. I totally understand people being disgruntled with the film not being true to the book, but they rarely do. Sometimes books don't lend themselves well to theater.. whatever.        Watching at Home:   I have a home theater system and the surround sound effects were something else, I was drawn in and was able to keep the volume at THX reference level during the entire film. Great sound, great effects and Will Smith was quite good. I hate to admit it, but I jumped a few times during the movie and I can't remember the last time a movie actually made me jump.  Though I gave it 4 stars, I think this is a 3.5 star movie. It doesn't fall into the realm of Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan or Lawrence of Arabia among other greats.  It was good movie, but not a great movie.     Would I add it to my collection, sure. It would be fun to watch again in a year or so.
B000UO338W|4.0|In 1992 when Psalm69 was out, Ministry was one of my favorite bands. I loved that album and The Mind Is A Terrible Thing due to their unique brand of industri-thrashmetal. Really a sound Ministry created and defined for themselves. Or I should say Al created and defined. Anyway, Filth Pig didn't live up to the high standards set by its predecessors, and then Ministry kind of faded off the map for me as Al's addiction took more control over of his musical output. After reading some reviews here on Amazon and longing for something in the league of Psalm69 I bought the latest (and last?) Ministry CD, The Last Sucker. I was pleasantly SHOCKED by the return to form of the classic Ministry of old. This album ROCKS and I don't think there is a bad song on here (even Psalm69 has a few clunkers near the end). The Last Sucker is packed with aggression, speed, and killer riffs and rhythms. Perhaps Al overdoes the anti-GWB thing a little in dedicating three entire albums to his personal arch enemy, but when the songs are this good it doesn't matter to me. Hey I'm no fan of Bush so slamming him doesn't offend me anyway. It's the music that stands out for me on this disc. If you haven't heard Ministry in a while and want to pick up something post-1992 I suggest this one, because it's excellent. I even enjoy the thrashed-out version of Roadhouse Blues. While I don't skip any songs on this entire CD, my favorites include: Lets Go, Watch Yourself, No Glory, Death and Destruction, Die In A Crash, and End of Days (parts one and two).
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|When one looks past the modest production values and few scenes where the acting seems a bit unrealistic (or perhaps simply to my American eye), Battle Royale succeeds in it's aims and succeeds as a movie. The fear of a situation of being pitted in a life or death situation was well-captured, and overall the acting was very good, especially considering the fact that besides Beat Takeshi, all of the other central are played by relative newcomers.     This may seem like an extremely violent film at face value, but Fukasaku tries hard not to overdo the violence and gore, and holds either a certain respect for or a certain humor of the portrayal of death (the one over-the-top scene seems more comedic than sickening, and seems fitting, due to the character's role as an antagonist). Because of the strive for realistic death, and because of the good acting in the scenes between the violence, characters are able to grow. Death of some of the more central characters begin to carry emotional weight, despite the cast of 40-odd characters packed into a 2 hour film. This is where I found Battle Royale a good film; despite amazingly short screen times for most of the characters, Fukasaku is still able to make us care about them, to sympathize with a position we will never find ourself in.    Now on to a completely different topic... As for this \\"Director's cut\\" from Amazon, I found it included some nice additional footage, from typical cast reviews to video of the whole cast celebrating Fukasaku's birthday. However, the quality of the picture of these as well as the movie was a bit grainy and of a lower quality than I'm used to, to the point where the DVD feels a bit like a bootleg. And because of the more than modest price of the DVD, I'd personally recommend you first look for other options. This copy wasn't terrible, but there are probably better versions at better prices.
B000UR366S|5.0|The message is very intense and profoundly spiritual,  As usual, the musicianship is also very fine.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I was able to get my hands on a copy of this album 3 weeks ago. For some reason my local record store got one copy early and i was lucky enough to purchase it (and for only 6$). Being a fan of their last album i was looking forward to purchasing it and was expecting another good solid album. But once i started listening i was immediately proved wrong. The album seemed too good to be true and i was just waiting for there to be a flaw on the album, like most albums have, but there were none. I've constantly been listening to it over the weeks and i am yet to get close to becoming sick of it. This album is incredible from top to bottom and i would never have expected this. There is a nice balance of softer rockers and hard rockers, and they've managed to change up their sound a little bit while remaining true to their style, and are consistent all the way through. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this album,not only because it is by far their best effort to date,  but also it is one of the best album i have heard in years, and might be the best album i own (and i own several hundred albums). Every song is terrific so its hard to choose a favorite, but i really love \\"By The Way\\" and \\"All Or Nothing\\". If you've never heard of them give them a chance because this is a must have for any modern rock fan, but is not only limited to those who just like rock. If this album does not make this band huge in the states then i don't know what else will. Think of Theory as Nickelback...but 5 times better (and i love nickelback).

0143038419|1.0|This book could not grab me. I couldn't even finish it and it is rare that I do not finish a book. Usually I will keep on trucking through it, but this one I just could not. It was just not very interesting.
0425220931|5.0|I am honored to write the first Amazon.com review of this book (which is also my first Amazon.com review period).    It's not often that you find a man who is as selfless, genuine, and true as Victor Wooten.      Everything that makes him so special is reflected in his first book.  There are so many lessons and inventive/new ways to look at music (typical of Victor).  The chapters in this book have not only helped me to become a better bassist but has helped restore in me the joy of self discovery as a musician, composer/arranger, and human being.    You will joyously find yourself picking up this \\"take to a desert island\\" book as you continue your growth as a musician and person.  This book is as top notch as everything else Victor puts his mind to.    Love You Victor!!!!
0525948023|2.0|Although the premise of this book is noteworthy; to improve ones self, it is wordy, hard to navigate, and to be honest with you there were few \\"Aha\\" moments in the book.    I honestly bought it because Oprah recommended it, a momentary lapse of judgment!  I am glad that I read it, but I honestly cannot recommend it unless you want to spend your time reading and rereading to get your arms around what could have been said much easier.  Hope this helps you!
B00132D808|5.0|[[ASIN:B00132D808 Pretty. Odd.]]  In theory I shouldn't like this album. I don't like the Paul McCartney Beatles stuff, its too fluffy. That being said I love this album. I even liked it from the first listen. It even took me a few listens to enjoy Brand New's Deja Entendu which is a classic.    This is not for fans that will hate any type of progression in a band. This is not a fever you can't sweet out. If you don't like Thrice's new albums you won't like this. If you can't appreciate Houses of the holy you will want to pass on this.    Fever was a really dark album about loss and heartache. This album for the most part is about having a more positive outlook on a world that you have very little control over (Do you know what I am seeing). I liked Fever I love Pretty. Odd.    If you are a music fan however this album is for you. Yes there are some Beatle influences here but this is still Panic at the Disco and they are on fire. Do you know what I am seeing is the most deep and thought provoking song I have heard in a long time.    Thank you Panic at the Disco for not resting on your laurels and knocking this album out of the park.
B00026ZG10|5.0|true lies is the story of a cia agent trying to uncover a terrorist plot and keep his identitie a secret from his wife and daughter. this is a great movie that is tons of fun. arnold schwarzennegger is great at mixing action and humor in his films and this is a prime example of that. james cammeron (the director) is know for his flashy, big budget action sequences and true lies is no different. the action scenes are awesome, my 2 favorites being a bathroom fight and a jet chase along a massive bridge. true lies features some \\"truely\\" amazing action, no \\"lie\\" (pun intended). another thing that makes true lies great is jamie lee curtis who plays arnold wife. she is incredibly sexy in my oppinion. she looks amazing for her age in a more mature way than most hollywood women now a days. true lies is just great fun from start to finish. its one of arnies best and its better than t2 (also directed by cameron) in my opinion. 5/5 for a true classic.

B000NW5WXU|4.0|\\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\"    This bleak passage begins Angela's Ashes, a starkly realistic account of a young boy growing up in poverty, in the slums of Ireland. McCourt does a wonderful job of making you feel what he does, be it remorse, shame, sadness, excitement, amusement, or pure joy. It is a wonder he survived his rough childhood; three of the eight children in his family were carried off by sickness and lack of decent living conditions. His family scraped by in a miserable shelter in a neighborhood so poor that there was only one latrine for the entire street, and when winter comes the latrine floods, making their downstairs rooms uninhabitable. McCourt himself was nearly killed by typhoid fever, and later develops an eye infection that caused him to lose one of the few joys of his life: his job, for it makes him feel like a man. He definitely is more of a man to the family than his father, who is unemployed for most of the book, and when he manages to pick up a job, drinks away the pay and is fired for failing to show up for work, failing the family over and over again until he disappears to England, abandoning them.   This book is written from a child's eyes, and this aspect is accented by the lack of punctuation. McCourt experiences daily disappointments, and rare occasions of happiness, as his family struggles to survive in the poorest parts of Ireland, discriminated against because of their backgrounds and odd accents, and living off the dole. It is a true account of life in Ireland, not at all sugar-coated. Angela's Ashes is a stirring, gripping memoir of life in an impoverished home.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|This double disk album represents the greatest music of modern cinema. John Williams is an absolute genius and you can literally see the movies run before your eyes while listening to the soundtracks. All of his greatest work up to 1999 is on this album, with popular themes like Star Wars or Jurassic Park and less known pieces like Summon the Heroes. For lovers of movie themes, this is the best and most complete album I've listened to. It is also played by amazing orchestras like London Symphony and Boston Pops, which are always a delight to hear. I am waiting impatiently for a new album with more recent themes like Geisha, and Harry Potter!
B000EQ47GS|5.0|In 1976 Tom Scholz after a few years of trying to achieve something in the music buisness decided that after his last attemp he was going to sell all his equipement and do something else.He had been trying to make a succesfull band since 1970 basicly just recording tapes in his basement.In 1975 Scholz borrowed Aerosmith's recording equipement and recorded what would be the band's first album.I am sure glad that it turned out to work if not we would have never had the chance to listen to the wonderfull and timeless album that is \\"Boston\\".In fact not only did it work,it turned out that it became one of the best-selling debut album with over 17 millions albums sold(if not the best-selling one),but you probably knew that by now.30+ years latter it is still as good as it was back then and hasn't lost any of its appeal.The band had good competition that year,Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\",KISS'\\"Destroyer\\",Aerosmith's \\"Rocks\\" and planty of others but managed to be on top with its distinctive sound which attracted both rockers and radio stations.It had a fews succesfull singles and most of these songs are still played on the rock stations even today,right there that should tell you something.<br /><br />Boston were said to have a sort of futuristic sound and were even marketed as \\"music trought science\\" as other reviewers have said.But Tom Scholz has often said that he did not use synthetizers for the album to get the sound,well whatever he did,he made it right!The album was commercial rock yeah,but this stills rocks to me,it just has more melody to it and it attracts a wider range of people.The musicians weren't incredible,Brad Delp did have an amazing voice and they were good but not extremely gifted musicians,still they played very well and everything sounds good,voices,guitars,bass,drums,all!The band does show its influences but it has its distinctive sound right from the start that makes it \\"Boston\\".They are one of the rare AOR rock bands that we can nearly all like.<br /><br />The first tracks \\"More Than A Feeling\\" stands out as a true classic of music and you must already have heard this one a lot already.It was the most famous song on the album and it was also the highest ranked single of it.Track two,\\"Piece Of Mind\\" is a strong follow-up just when you tought it couldn't get any better!A personnal favourite,very good song.\\"Foreplay/Longtime\\" is really a song that goes into one other and has perfect balance,amazing once again and at 7:48 its impressive.\\"Rock'N'Roll Band\\" is the typical song you would find on a debut album,aspirations to become a rock band and all that,but this one is more about how they felt towards discovering the rock stars lifestyle.\\"Smokin'\\",a good song it doens't really mean much else but then again a song doesn't have to mean anything to be appreciated,its not a standout but I like it to say the least,but compared to all the previous songs its not so impressive...\\"Hitch A Ride\\" a slower song with a slight ballad approach,very good showing the melodic side of the band even more,very good.\\"Something About You\\" a fun rocker,short at 3:48 but very solid and the lyrics are great and everything about the song is catchy!Still this one was the least popular off the album.\\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\",the slower-paced song of the album and written by Brad Delp(all others were penned by Scholz)it certainly has a nice feel,its pretty good.No song,I repeat no song are BAD on \\"Boston\\".<br /><br />We finally get a decent remaster for this true classic which fans had been wanting for year.The 1990 remaster had rather poor sound and therefore did not sound as good,it would be the edition that I would recommmend quality-wise.Yep its been done in 2006 by Scholz himself and it is to note that he also remastered the second Boston album,\\"Don't Look Back\\" as well.He did a good job on it too!If my and the other reviewers who were positive didn't convice you,I don't know what would.Maybe the fact that it is a 200 Definitive could convince you.You have all the good reasons to buy Boston's debut album,MUSIC THIS GOOD HAS TO BE HEARD EVERYONE!An absolute five stars,it just can't get much better this,its the best Boston album in my opinion but the first three albums of the band are pretty good and also worth looking at.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED(In fact you should click \\"Purchase\\" right now if you don't already have this!ll the good reasons to buy Boston's debut album,MUSIC THIS GOOD HAS TO BE HEARD EVERYONE!An absolute five stars,it just can't get much better this,its the best Boston album in my opinion but the first three albums of the band are pretty good and also worth looking at.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED(In fact you should click \\"Purchase\\" right now if you don't already have this!
0307387178|3.0|Chris McCandless' body was found not far from the border of Denali National Park in an abandoned bus that had been hauled into the back country for use as a temporary shelter for hunters.  McCandless had been staying in this bus for some time as he attempted to live off the land in the vast and dangerous wilds of Alaska.  The mystery of his death is not so much how he died (which apparently was more-or-less from starvation) but how he came to the point in his life where he would walk alone into the unforgiving Alaskan wilderness with only supplemental provisions and attempt to live almost entirely off the land.     Indeed, there appears little in Chris' upbringing that foreshadows the uncompromising choice Chris would later make.  He was brought up middle-upper class, well educated and apparently in a home no more dysfunctional than most.  Yet, beginning after high school, Chris embarked on quite lengthy solo travels and turned distinctly against his parents.  After graduating from college, he, rather than preparing for post-graduate study as his parents believed, liquidated his college savings and set out alone on what would become a more than year-long sojourn in the West.  During this time he became adroit at surviving on very little, living the anti-materialist belief system he had apparently adopted.  Along the way he met and touched a few who were impressed by his integrity, if frightened by the implementation of his beliefs.  Ultimately, Chris chose to attempt his anti-materialist lifestyle for a period in America's greatest remaining wilderness.  With tragic results.    The story is no doubt intriguing and timeless - a young man tries his moral firmness against the bare knuckles of nature.  Moreover, Jon Krakauer's writing is certainly well-paced and interestingly discursive - eminently readable.  For two reasons, though, I found myself somewhat disappointed by this book that I fully intended to love.  First, it appears to me that Krakauer did not have sufficient material to fill this book.   Perhaps in article form this story left readers wanting more.  However, at book length we are lead through stories about McCandless and/or his contemporaries that are not interesting or apparently important.  It almost seems as though Krakauer put every bit of McCandless that he could find into this book regardless of importance.  The result is that significant portions of the text do not move the story forward.    Second, it is unfortunate, in my opinion, that so much weight is piled on this young man's back.  There seems little indication that Chris saw himself as a messiah or a seer, yet his name and story is often mentioned with weighty reverence.  Perhaps, Krakauer is less guilty of this than his fans, but this novel does certainly attempt to present McCandless as an example, if flawed, to follow - almost a lite hagiography.  The story, however, does not, in my opinion, have the substance to bear the weight.  McCandless' philosophy on life does not appear well-preserved, and may well not have been well-considered.  Though perhaps his choices were somewhat more severe than many young men, the fundamental pattern of his early adult wandering does not strike me as revolutionary.  That said, McCandless does not, in my view, need to be Thoreau or Jeremiah to be worthy of our consideration.  His story is interesting enough without the pretensions to cosmic importance.    I think most readers would find this book interesting and a fine read.  Though it has some shortcomings, Into the Wild introduces us to a young man who acted as many claim to intend to act, but unfortunately died young.  He is well worth knowing.
B00000K19E|5.0|Last night, I have watched one of my favorite movies, \\"The Matrix\\" as I have seen it many times. I would highly recommend this movie, and I am not talking about just the full trilogy. I am talking about the very first one, this one. There is alot of symbolism in this movie and certainly several aspects that would drive one mad and utter turns to disbelief if it were to be true. What if our reality is the Matrix? Don't start looking for the holes on your arms...yet.<br /><br />Also, there was alot of dailogues between Neo and Morpheus that is memorable, including this one:<br /><br />\\"The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. Were you listening to me, Neo? Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?\\"<br /><br />The woman in the red dress is what we would consider to be temptation.  There are those who tasted temptation, lived for it, and will die for it...even though it is a lie. Interesting, eh?<br /><br />Go out and see this movie. It is surely a must see and there's a good deal to learn from it. But, if you're not into symbolism of the movie, the actions and fights were \\"awesome,\\" as my inner child would say.
0452289963|5.0|Well you either get it or you don't and for some this book will not make any sense and like Eckhart explains it just may not be the right time for you to read this in your life...for me it was a huge wake up call about the ego in us all, the complainer in us all and looking to blame others for our mishaps and pain.  It helps to put the ego aside while reading this which I say with a smile on my face! I loved this book and have read many books with similar beliefs but this one is by far the best as it is so well written by a very beautiful human being.  I am following the live online class with Oprah and Eckhart and have just started to read it for a second time and also purchased it on audio CD's.  I agree with another reviewer here that Byron Katie's book \\"Loving What Is\\" is also a wonderful book I recommend reading.

1569242739|5.0|Let's start by saying that I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but I do have an intolerance to dairy and wheat, and so do both my daughters.<br /><br />Let's also say that while I consider myself a good cook, until recently my experiences with baking had been somewhat disappointing. I decided to change that, especially because of my oldest daughter. There seems to be a birthday, bake sale or celebration of some kind every other week at her school, and I wanted her to be able to enjoy something without the stomach upset that almost invariably follows dairy and wheat consumption. I decided to start with cupcakes because they are less threatening than cake (to me, the inexperienced baker) and kids love them (and so do most adults).<br /><br />I chose this book based on the reviews, and I am very glad I did! I have now made cupcakes a few times and I am very happy with the results. I was able to make very good vegan, gluten-free vanilla cupcakes for a school celebration and absolutely scrumptious sugar-free (agave-sweetened) chocolate cupcakes for a brunch, and got rave reviews both times.<br /><br />The book gives very clear instructions in the recipes, clear explanations of the ingredients to chose in the introductory section, and it even includes troubleshooting tips for all of us new to baking cupcakes, which are absolutely brilliant because I was able to immediately pinpoint and correct the reason why my first cupcakes had sunk (oven temperature).<br /><br />The book also features numerous recipes that range from the classic cupcakes like Vanilla and Chocolate, to some very fun, made-to-impress recipes like Cookies 'n' Cream Cupcakes, Tiramis&ugrave; Cupcakes and Chocolate Cherry Cr&egrave;me Cupcakes (and more) to the adventurous and interesting like Green Tea Cupcakes with Green Tea Glaze and Almond Flowers, Chai Latte Cupcakes or Pistachio Rosewater Cupcakes, sure to attract attention at your next party and make you known as \\"the one with the delicious cupcakes\\" from the very first time around.<br /><br />If I had one issue with this book would be that the recipes include a bit too much sugar, but I was quickly mollified by the fact that the authors include clear instructions to modify the recipes so they can be made with Agave Syrup instead - and also include a recipe for Agave-sweetened vanilla or chocolate cupcakes, and one for Agave-sweetened icing. I also appreciate that they included a recipe for gluten-free cupcakes, thereby giving some guidance for adventurous cooks who are ready to modify the other recipes in the book the same way.<br /><br />So for all these reasons (and more, because I'm peretty sure I forgot something!), I give this book 5 stars, a rare occurrence but fully deserved!!I had one issue with this book would be that the recipes include a bit too much sugar, but I was quickly mollified by the fact that the authors include clear instructions to modify the recipes so they can be made with Agave Syrup instead - and also include a recipe for Agave-sweetened vanilla or chocolate cupcakes, and one for Agave-sweetened icing.

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|All R.E.M. fans seem to have a phase that they like the most (many in fact, do not like the other stages very much at all).  Some favor the band during their I.R.S. days, when they were the smallest big band in America.  These people were smallish in number, but obsessive and loyal in nature. They wondered what a \\"Harborcoat\\" was and were shocked when the actual lyrics of the song \\"Fall on Me\\" were shown in the video.      Then, on a major label and with a wah-wah pedal (or maybe a mandolin) R.E.M. became the rock superstars that everyone knew.  The band, as Kurt Cobain said, handled their success like saints, turning down millions to not let their songs be used by Bill Gates, and refused to make the same album twice to cash in on their massive popularity.     Yet, with any success comes a backlash, and with 1994's Monster, many fans of both eras began to drift away.  By 1997, with the departure of Bill Berry, the band moved into another era.  One that found the band trying to figure out a direction to go which could, somehow, tie everything together on a collective positive level.      Accelerate is the music of a band who has found that path.  It will not bring back the Murmur/Reckoning faithful.  It will not sell like Out of Time. Perhaps, one day, more music fans will like the studio sounds of the last three records.  It is not like those albums either.      What Accelerate is, is R.E.M. phase four music.  Alive and vital in 2008. A record that will have its fans and critics, but signifies the beginning of a new era in the bands history. One that by looking forward, also can reach back, where fans of all three groups might find key elements that represent why they became fans to begin with. It also deserves to make its fair share of new ones.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, ever since it premiered in theathers I have watched it every Christmas! This is a wonderful story of simply believing.
1401216676|5.0|This is a well written and well drawn book - not for children, but nothing Alan Moore does is. I still have my copy from \\"back in the day\\" and I've kept it in good condition. I don't need another one. But, as the review title says, if you don't have this book by all means buy it.

0385338724|5.0|Ok... so I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books, it's like a serious addiction if you know what I mean. I was with my boyfriend looking through Entertainment magazine a week ago and saw Sophie's new book Remember Me? Which was #3 on the top 20 books of the week. He was sweet and surprised me with the book. I picked up the book and couldn't put it down, every single night before bed I read at least 3 chapters. I started it on Monday and finished it on Sunday! I don't want to give away too much, but the gist of the story was about a woman, Lexi, who lost her memory due to a car accident and was missing the pieces of her life for 3 years, from 2004 to 2007. When she steps in front of the mirror for the first time since the accident, she doesn't recognize who she is and her life... I won't tell you more as I will ruin the rest.     All I can say is it's yet another award winning book from Sophie Kinsella, I need a new book fast!!

B00139B39E|3.0|Well, DT is one of my very favorite bands overall and I found the idea of a greatest hits CD quite good to have a good introduction to their music. Let me tell you that I am making this review without even listening the CD once so I cannot talk about the quality of the remasters etc. etc. But I find a song missing in the track list; \\"Stream of consciousness\\" is a must! so if you decide to buy this CD you may complement it with \\"train of thoughts\\" I think they both will be a really great purchase.
B00034EOKA|5.0|With joy and regret I finished A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, the tale of the Nolan family (and the Romelly women too). Started by eleven-year-old bookworm Francie Nolan and told by her younger and older selves, this book is rich with all the truth and tragedy of life at the turn of the century. Francie, born sickly and never quite getting enough food, thirsts for knowledge and in ways that she doesn't understand, love. Katie, her mother is a hardened and hard-working scrub woman who takes care of the family when her drunk but handsome husband is between jobs, which is most of the time. Though Francie and her father are very different, he understands her in a way that her mother can't and her brother Neely won't.<br /><br />On each page, there is something rich about the Brooklyn in all of us, the stingy place where we nail down our best dreams in tin cup banks and pray that something amazing grows out of the often sour soil of our lives. Francis and her family remind us that are many things in the world more important than money.  This one goes on my \\"Books for Life\\" list. It's a keeper to be read over and over.
B000002IMG|3.0|Average is the general review I would give for all of Testament's albums. I think Alex Skolnick is a great guitarist but everything else about the band is horribly mediocre. Also, it may be my imagination but Skolnick seems to include a lot of Klezmer in his arrangements.  That's great but it's a little overdone.  This is supposed to be thrash and I don't want to feel like I'm at a barmitzva or watching 'Fiddler on the Roof' with every song I hear.  All of the songs essentially have the same drum beat and the same vocal arrangements. The singer is mediocre at best. The most one will hear of him is his voice break as he's screeching 'til blue in the face.  I keep on imagining the last lyrics to 'Preacher' as being:    Listen to these words I screech  Catastrophic singing lessons  They shall teach  (Just follow the screecher!)    Listening to this album would be like listening to Metallica's Master of Puppets where every song is essentially in the same form as 'Battery.' Everything seems to be just a generic backdrop to Alex Skolnick's guitar lead and the band should more properly be called 'Alex Skolnick's Testament'. Take out Skolnick's solos and you essentially have nothing whatsoever:  you can't tell whether you're listening to Anthrax, Exodus, or Overkill. It all sounds the same. The lyrics and singing seem more as an afterthought: generically bland and meaningless.
0307346617|3.0|...and I say that hopefully.     Having created a world infested since prehistoric times with hordes of living dead, Max Brooks describes what would happen in the event of a Stage 4 zombie outbreak, in which the undead armies, re-animated by the mysterious Solanum virus, drive humanity to the verge of extinction. In the nightmarish chaos that engulfs the world in this  scenario, we examine the first-hand accounts of various survivors throughout the globe. Soldiers. Politicians. Doctors. Everyday people forced to face the unthinkable and somehow come away alive, human, and with their souls intact.    In a work of fiction, I am usually able to put certain liberal biases aside (even a right-winger like myself can understand that coming from the entertainment industry, Brooks is going to have his opinions and prejudices just like any human being), so Brooks' views about universal healthcare, the military-industrial complex, the Iraq war (which he actually treats better than most liberals, BTW) and other issues do not distract from the overall story. (Although forget zombies - Howard Dean as president of the USA? Now THERE's a scary story!)    My only complaint is that the book is so wide in scope that it sacrifices depth, which seems out of place in a work of potentially-epic fiction. Now, I'm not asking for the LOTR Trilogy of horror novels, but Brooks has created a big sandbox for himself in this near-apocalyptic world, and it would be a shame not to build some bigger castles in it. I would really love to read a 5-6 chapter arc where someone tries to cross an infested area, say between DC and Baltimore (like in the \\"On the Run\\" chapter of the Guide) or clears out a city/town after the counterattack begins.    Hopefully this won't be his last book in the \\"series,\\" because he's really got something good here.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Absolutely one of the most creative and enjoyable series made for television.  Don't miss one episode!
1400049628|5.0|Whatever Max Brooks was drinking when he dreamed this up, buy me a case of it. Not only did this deadpan masterpiece of satire give me multiple evenings of enjoyment, but it gave me MULTIPLE evenings due to his exhaustive descriptions of the weapons, tactics and supplies necessary to survive every possible scenario of an attack by the undead.    After detailing the proper way to survive everything from a Stage 1 outbreak (5-10 zombies causing trouble at a local stripmall) to a Stage 4 (end of the world, apocalypse-like stuff), Brooks finishes with a chapter detailing zombie outbreaks throughout history. This may prove fertile ground for future novels, should he ever choose to explore it.

1933784032|4.0|The Star Wars exhibit recently appeared at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia where I had a chance to see it.  Talk about fueling the mystique of an already magical part of my childhood!  Although I would recommend seeing this exhibit first hand, this book is the next best thing.  No, maybe it is the better of the two, since you can take this home and keep it.<br /><br />The only reason this is not a 5-star review is that, since seeing the exhibit as reawakened my enthusiasm for making plastic model kits (something that has slumbered peacefully since I was in my mid-teens), I have a need for reference material to accurately reproduce these models, and this book only has a tantalizingly small group of extreme close ups of some sections of the filming models.  Of course, a 5-star book that would satisfy my needs would be impossibly thick and cost... a lot.<br /><br />This book certainly has a \\"wow, look at that\\" factor.  It shows you the intimate details that are missed onscreen, and you will come to appreciate on a deeper level the degree of attention spent on these films.
B001608QVS|5.0|Sound & Vision magazine did a recent article on Warner Home Video and their transferring of film to video with the new 4K transfer process - it's the most state of the art in transferring technology allowing for greater detail, color reproduction and clarity.

B00005IB57|5.0|I've owned Arrau's nocturnes ever since they were first released on vinyl. They are an old man's Chopin, in the best sense--reflective, melancholy, aching. Arrau investigates the local detail in these inexhaustible pieces to a degree just short--an important qualification--of mannered, and so may not be to everyone's taste (compared, say, to Rubenstein). But Arrau's control and elegance keep him just on the right side of that emotional knife-edge, lending great poignancy to the performances and keeping them interesting on repeated hearings. The only weakness for years had been the constricted frequency extremes of the Phillips recording, which is noticeably improved on this higher-resolution remastering, especially in the ethereal upper registers. It still can't compete with the richness of David Jones's historic recordings of Ivan Moravec (no doubt helped by Moravec's Bosendorfer) in what are without doubt the greatest interpretations of the nocturnes ever committed to disc. But I would not  be without both, and Arrau's readings carry the air of a world, and a performance tradition, that we will never see again.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a good, fun movie, and is in the category of 'videos we don't mind watching over and over' with my daughter. It has all the best qualities of Pixar, which includes great characters (it isn't just about the animation).

B000IOM1Z0|4.0|The Turn of a Friendly Card is one of Alan Parsons best albums, and the newly remastered version is clearly better than the original CD release.  The sound is good, but not great.  Some remasters are radically better, and although it is an improvement, it lacks some of the \\"wow factor\\" that I would give to a great remastering job. The bonus tracks are interesting, with the Chris Rainbow overdub my favorite.  Even if you have an old copy of the original CD release, this version is still worth buying.

Every recipe I've tried has been very authentic and great, except perhaps the recipe for cannolis called for a little too much cinnamon for my son's taste. The recipe for Rollatini di Pesce Spada was one of the best fish dishes I've ever made!    Even if you don't watch the Sopranos, if you like good old-fashioned Italian food, get this book!
B000BCKFWK|4.0|A visually audacious movie and an unpredictably wild ride into palookaville, this is one unique film viewing experience. I am not familiar with Frank Miller's [[ASIN:1593963149 Sin City]] graphic novels, but my guess is that Miller, who shares a co-director credit with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, has remained faithful in capturing the hard-boiled, crime-infested world of Basin City and its cynical inhabitants. This 2005 film takes a visual cue from 2004's [[ASIN:B0006IIPIK Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]] by green-screening the backdrops and using digitally-produced images as the landscape, but that's where the similarity ends. Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black-and-white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black-and white [[ASIN:B00012QM8G Schindler's List]]). It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern-day film noir sensibilities which includes pulp fiction-type dialogue and a rogue's gallery of exaggerated characters, some made up in prosthetics to make you think you've landed in the dark side of a Dick Tracy comic strip. But Miller's world feels much different, at once capturing the cartoonish, highly stylized violence of Quentin Tarnatino's films (he is identified as \\"Special Guest Director\\" though I'm unclear what he exactly did) and the special effects-driven black humor of Robert Zemeckis' [[ASIN:0783225482 Death Becomes Her]] (which coincidentally starred Bruce Willis).<br /><br />The plot revolves around three separate stories that share some of the supporting characters but little more than that story-wise. Continuing to improve and deepen with age, Willis plays a tough-talking cop named Hartigan in the first one. Just before accepting his pension, he pursues one last case to save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a murderous psychopath who happens to be the son of a US senator. The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita-esque Jessica Alba. Completely unrecognizable as the actor who once enticed and coerced Kim Basinger in Adrian Lyne's [[ASIN:B00004XMV6 9 1/2 Weeks]], Mickey Rourke portrays Marv, a contract killer who falls in love with a beautiful hooker who is murdered in her sleep. His journey in finding her killer creates the most concurrently harrowing and darkly hilarious joyride in the movie, replete with decapitated heads of beautiful women mounted on a wall, a mute psycho-killer played by Elijah Wood (stunt casting for sure but intriguing in exposing a dark side to his Frodo persona) and a comic electric-chair execution scene. Rourke is a revelation, grotesquely ugly and built like a Mac truck but strangely insightful and impervious to what happens to his character.<br /><br />The third story is the most surreal with a monotone-voiced Clive Owen, an almost heroic fugitive named Dwight, who saves a mouthy barmaid (an annoying Brittany Murphy) and a gang of empowered prostitutes (led by his former lover played in convincing dominatrix fashion by Rosario Dawson) from a corrupt cop. A Cyrano-nosed Benicio del Toro portrays the cop with his trademark fiery menace in what feels like a throwback to his career before [[ASIN:B000067IZ3 Traffic]]. Dead people don't stay dead in any of the stories, but in this one, the concept is taken to an extreme, and the clutches between Owen and Dawson amid the violence provide a surprisingly amusing touch. Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under-the-radar actors get a chance to chew on some scenery in atypical roles, chief among them Carla Gugino as a perennially nude lesbian parole officer, Nick Stahl as the senator's son who becomes the comically disgusting Yellow Bastard, and in seething, whatever-happened-to-them cameos, Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer.<br /><br />All the ingredients are so over-the-top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme. Moreover, for a movie so dependent on style to sustain itself over its two-hour-plus running time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements. After all, one can take in only so many severed heads and limbs and heads shoved in toilets, as well as the inordinate amount of blood splattering in colors ranging from red to white to yellow. But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life. Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride. The incremental value of the two-disc Collector's Edition DVD set over the standard [[ASIN:B00005JNTX single disc]] will depend on whether you have become obsessed with this cult film since there is only a behind-the-scenes featurette on the single disc.<br /><br />Disc One contains the 124-minute, theatrical-release version with an excessive three audio commentaries. The first is with Rodriguez and Miller, who focus mainly on the book-to-screen translation and benefits from the author's perspective. The second has Tarantino and Willis join Rodriguez, and the focus turns to the technical aspects of the production even though Tarantino's contribution to the film is marginal at best. The third commentary track is actually the recording of the audience reaction at the movie's Austin premi&egrave;re in order to replicate the experience one would have had at the theater. The remaining extras on Disc One may seem superfluous if you already sat through the first two commentary tracks.

There is an odd feature on Disc One, \\"Sin-Chroni-City Interactive\\", which allows you to pick characters and locations and get a timeline view of relevant events.

B000YABYLA|3.0|It's interesting: you'd think a film about a knocked up teenager would be more drama than comedy. Not Juno, though!     Juno handles her pregnancy pretty well considering. Her dilemma mostly surrounds her feeling for the guy who impregnated her. That whole storyline is 'cute' but not necessarily very original and exciting.     I much preferred the other emotional half of the movie: the conflict between the foster parents toward getting their first child. Thing is: if they are the emotional heart of the story, then shouldn't it be THEIR story instead and not Juno's? In some ways, it could have worked better.     The other things I liked about the movie were the music (Great! Get the soundtrack)and the art direction (which you can see from the movie cover). It was fun, but kind of so-so in my opinion. If you want a REALLY good movie about teen pregnancy that's dramatic and funny, try Saved! I think that's a better movie.
B000OV170W|4.0|My Sister's Keeper was a captivating and enthralling book. The testimony of each character blew me away, and Anna's passionate advocation for what was right was moving and inspring. The themes were developed and strong;  each character blossomed and grew throughout the novel. The lives and actions of these ordinary people were portrayed in such a realistic way, and yet the plot was twisted and unpredictable, with surprises at every turn. Some of the characters did things that seemed immoral and wrong, like Sara's fury at Anna. However, after reading a few chapters more, the insights and thoughts of the characters showed you that they were really trying to do the right thing. The moral of this is that sometimes, there is not a right way to do things, and somebody will always get hurt. My only criticism of this book is the ending. It is far too abrupt, and it leaves too many  burning questions unanswered. However, all in all, this is a tragic, yet fantastic, moving book which would touch even the coldest of hearts.

B00005JLKB|5.0|Ok, you don't need me to tell you how great this show is... but I will anyway. The acting is top notch, the plots are mind bending and the characters are completely 3 dimensional. The first season took about 3 episodes to get on it's feet... everything beyond that is history. You'll find yourself crazy to watch the next episode, each one more entertaining and pleasing to watch than the last. Not since \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\" have I enjoyed a show this much.   Oh, and by the way... While you're watching Season 1 you'll probably think, \\"this show can't get any better.\\" Trust me, each season is a massive improvement over the last, you'll be blown away.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I can't review this album in too much detail as I've only heard it four times all the way through but I agree with most that the album is a return to glory for REM.  They recorded great songs on UP and Reveal but neither of those albums felt consistently great.  And as for Around The Sun, well, lets just say I honestly felt it was a Michael Stipe solo record.  Accelerate is definitely their most energetic album since Green in my opinion.  They spent too many years with synths and strings and although I loves me some Automatic For The People, they stayed in that vein for far too long.<br /><br />What really sets this album apart, though, is the return of Peter Buck and his guitar.  I don't know if he forgot he knew how to play one or what but since his over-indulgent use of them on Monster it has been largely absent.  This was a sad turn of events as his guitar work always defined pre-Out Of Time REM.  Let's hope his guitar stays front and center from this point on because the results are always fantastic.<br /><br />Favorite tracks so far:<br /><br />Supernatural Superserious<br />Hollow Man<br />Until The Day Is Done<br />I'm Gonna DJ

0307388840|5.0|It's difficult to describe the plot of this novel without giving it away.  Briony is a thirteen-year-old aspiring writer.  Her sister, Cecilia, and their tenant's son, Robbie, have just returned from Cambridge.  On a hot day in the summer of 1935, Briony sees adult events that she can't understand and sets in motion a series of events that changes their lives forever.    This is not a feel-good story.  But for those who are willing to recognize that there isn't always a happy ending, this is a brilliant and absorbing read.  The structure that McEwan gives to his novel is complex but effective and not fully appreciable until the end of the book.  The characters are realistically drawn, and the reader can understand each character's point of view without being forced to empathize with them.  Perhaps most striking is the highly evocative imagery.  The novel focuses mainly on three settings: the Tallis estate in Surrey, war-torn France, and a hospital in London, all of which are depicted with incredible detail.  The novel is an incredible explication on the results of our actions.
B000H1QYXY|4.0|George Michael made some of the tightest cuts back in the day. the guy truly could write and Sing. his wham days had moments,but his Solo career is what made him a household name. and I still feel with the right type of record now he could easily come back.he has serious talent and for my Money Justin Timberlake  could't hold one of George Michael's Choose Life Shirts. Carless Whisper, Jesus to a child, fastlove, one more try,praying for time,etc... George Michael was that dude back in the day who had style,charisma and brought alot of feeling in his music. i'd like to see him make one more serious run because he has the kind of talent that could easily hang today and even longer if he wanted to. this is a very good collection and a reminder of a true talent. in truth the Cat is very Underrated.

I realize these comparisons may not entice people looking for an album like GREEN or LIFE'S RICH PAGEANT.<br /><br />Accelerate pounds along, forgetting the bogs of sound exploration found on Reveal & Around the Sun (and even Monster). The drums are alive, the guitar sings, and even though Stipe's voice can't carry on the way it did back in the 80s and early 90s, he's written songs that suit where his voice is. There aren't any moments where the lack of a strong, long note from Stipe would fix a song. These are finely tuned, fun pieces.<br /><br />I'd list my favorite tracks, but none of that is necessary. If you were turned off by REM with Up, Reveal, and Around the Sun, this one might be what you need. It'll cleanse you. buy it. put it on repeat.<br /><br />* I don't think monster is a travesty of music, so this connection is meant to be positive.
B00000G3PA|3.0|This movie starts off with some great effects and some good scenes featuring the drilling crew.  It sets up a very predictable plot and is not that exciting by the end.  But for a good price it is worth getting.
B0013FYTA8|3.0|I heard \\"So Happy\\" on the radio and thought it was either Nickelback or Puddle of Mudd. It turns out to be a new single from Theory of a Deadman. This band has matured over the years musically, but still takes its songwriting style and vocal arrangements directly from Nickelback. Vocally, Tyler Connolly has really come a long way. I would say that lyrically they surpass Nickelback by offering songs of more substance and maturity in their writing. Musically there are a lot of similarities to Nickelback, and I mean A LOT! You could put Chad Kroger in as a vocalist and you would think it was a new album from NB. The production quality is of excellent quality and kudos to Howard Benson. You can hear a lot of Seether and Daughtry (which he also produced) in the music. This isn't a bad thing if you enjoy that sound, its just not very original. Who knows, stick with the sound you know sells.    The Songs:    1. So Happy: A rocking tune similar to Puddle of Mudd/Nickelback  2. By The Way: A Little Seether here, sort of slow. Good song.  3. Got It Made: Another rocker, steady, fast - could be a single  4. Not Meant To Be: I swear, does Nickelback sell songs to bands?  5. Crutch: Getting heavier  6. All or Nothing - Could have been called \\"How You Remind Me Part 2\\"  7. Heaven (Little By Little): Slow ballad. Highlights vocals. Nice.  8. Bad Girlfriend: Nothing special here. Sounds like they ripped off the Cult on the guitar.  9. Hate My Life: Lets take NB's Rockstar and change the lyrics. Hated it.  10. Little Smirk: Getting bored of the CD now.  11. End Of The Summer: Another nice ballad.  12. Wait For Me: What?? Another ballad. Slower.  13. Sacrifice: End of the CD, and it appears the band has run out of ideas, its all starting to sound the same.    Summary: Overall a great sounding CD, production value is really up there. Lyrics are good, mature. Songwriting from music point of view, gets repetitive, sounds A LOT like Nickelback. Hints of Seether in there.    Buy it, worthlistening to, and most of all, doesn't sound like all the EMO/Screamo music out there and is a breath of fresh air to see that a band, though ripping off others somewhat, can come out with something somewhat original.
B00004ZBVG|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie for years.  It has a good story, great acting, and you don't get tired of it.
B00132D808|2.0|This album was recommended to me by my beloved Amazon because I rated \\"A Fever... by Panic! ...\\" highly. I would like to point out, that this album, \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" was released under the artist name of \\"Panic at the Disco\\" without the exclamation point. Furthermore, musical data bases such as AMG and Pandora, have the artists registered as completely separate.<br /><br />Keeping that in mind: I wish I never bought this album.<br /><br />The cover art was my first sign of danger, looking all old and last century, but I trusted Panic! seeing how I'd buy their album over again if I had to. I figured the lack of explanation point was just the design, but no. I don't know how I missed it, but they have officially changed their band name, in addition to completely changing the direction of which they are taking their music. Their new sound is very... very... plain, the music is very country and folky, and does not appeal to some people. The vocals are still amazing, and some tracks could pass as bearable if you ARE into folk that sounds depressing. It's almost as if Nine In The Afternoon is a well crafted trap to cleverly trick you into thinking northing's awry. There is just too many new elements that I can't take such as the harmonica and the light guitar and the lack of a piano, even in the song with PIANO in the title.<br /><br />Panic! should not have changed so much, so soon, all at once. This will cost them their careers. Artists that take things in a different direction, do so GRADUALLY and CAREFULLY. Thrice is really the best example. They started experimenting once they had a strong reputation to fall back on. All else failed, and they could have taken it back a step. If you liked Panic! for the fast songs, and the show-tune noise that made them different, or the strong/epic feeling you were left with... you'll hate this album. I'm just letting you know, that you will not even be listening to \\"Panic! at the Disco\\".
B000002UAO|5.0|so many don't appreciate the wide variance of their music - in its time  this album was a knockout - a true classic album!!!
0345494768|5.0|Having seen all 3 original trilogy movies over a hundred times a piece, (I paid theater admission for most of those viewings, no video back then), I was and still am interested in the behind the scenes events that took place during the making of the movies.    I have read all three of the \\"Making Of\\" books about the original trilogy.   This book is definitely the most thorough and indepth with the technical aspects and day to day events on set.   I enjoyed the interviews with George Lucas and the other people involved in the film.   On the lighter side,  (Being a huge Luke/Mark Hamill fan) I really enjoyed the candid photos of  Mark Hamill and the other cast members on set.        The true Star Wars fan will enjoy the unlimited access to George Lucas' earliest thoughts about the trilogy and a detailed look into his film making style.   This book is a must have for all who have ever dreamed of  \\"a galaxy far, far away....
B000PTYPAC|1.0|This album deserves one star; bad lyrics, boring vocals, bad/boring musicians, bad everything.  Leave this to the 14 year old girls who don't know any better, and pick up something worthwhile.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Well I can't say that I have all of A7X albums or that I'm the biggest fan but I can say that I bought this self titled album and really do like it. I appreciate all the riffs on alot of their songs and the drumming is awesome..Gunslinger is an unexpected beat for them but the lyrics to this song are AWESOME! It makes me remember a loved one that's passed away recently and believe it or not has helped me cope with the loss. I got the same feeling from the last track Dear God. I haven't skipped any song on this album cause it's just that damn good. A7X is AWESOME and I know what I like and I like it ALOT!!! I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!
B000AYEL6U|4.0|First I must say that I have not read the book (yet), nor did I go into viewing this with any expectations of any sort.    I found the beginning of the script's plotline very choppy -- it didn't make sense to me, nor did it give a good introduction to the characters, particularly the two lead characters -- Thornton and Margaret.  She came across as careless of her poor suitor's feelings, and a bit cruel -- Thornton as far too brutish in his opening scene.  It was clear without even reading the book (or knowing anything about it) that a huge amount was being hacked out of the story.    I also felt that the editing left a lot to be desired in many places -- the extended proposal scene in the dvd extras is much, much better than the chopped up scene in the actual program, where the character's responses to each other don't even make sense in some spots.    Ultimately, what finally saves this production from mediocrity is the acting.  Richard Armitage and Sinead Cusack in particular were simply brilliant.  Armitage captured the essence of the pain and longing of unrequited love in his every look.  Cusack took what could have been a very cliched overbearing mother and made her strong, warm, loving and protective.  I also felt that Brendon Coyle added a lot in his part as Nicholas Higgins.  And though I found it hard to really like Margaret, I cannot fault Ms.Denby-Ashe's technique in any way -- I feel that a bit better writing might have made the character more sympathetic.      Still well worth viewing, just for the strong performances by nearly all of the cast.  Just have a little patience with the plotline, and scripting.

0712676740|4.0|This is the fourth in a series of what has been, until now, exceptionally well written time travel, adventure/romance books by the author. There are six such books published to date. I urge the reader to start at the beginning and read each and every one in the order in which it was written. Be not afraid of the length of each book. Trust me when I say that you will end up wishing that they were each longer, so riveting is the story that the author unfolds. Ms. Gabaldon is a master storyteller without compare, employing the superlative use of actual historical events with authentic period detail to weave a three dimensional tapestry of timeless love and adventure. While the core of the story is about a love that transcends time, it is an adventure story that holds the reader in its thrall.<br /><br />The love that spans time is that which twentieth century Englishwoman, Claire Randall, has for eighteenth century Scottish highlands warrior, James Fraser. Those readers who have read the first book in the series, \\"Outlander\\", know that in 1945, Claire, a combat nurse during World War II, is reunited with her husband, Frank, after the war. While on a second honeymoon in Scotland, she visits a strange, flat topped hill, where a forbidding stone circle draws her. Touching one of the stones, she is hurled through a vortex in time and finds herself in eighteenth century Scotland, where she meets the brave and brawny, red headed Scot, James Fraser, with whom she falls head over heels in love. Finding herself thrust into the midst of clan warfare and intrigue, she and her beloved 'Jamie' have enough adventures to last a lifetime.<br /><br />The second book, \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\", is a continuation of that story, told from the perspective of the twentieth century where Claire, now a doctor, has lived for the past twenty years. Upon the death of her twentieth century husband, Frank, Claire returns to Scotland with her grown, red headed daughter, Brianna. There she discloses to Brianna the events of her secret past, as well as the truth as to who Brianna's biological father truly is and of the love that Claire bore him.<br /><br />While in Scotland, however, Claire discovers something that will change her future, as well as her past. You see, for the past twenty years Claire has mistakenly believed that her beloved 'Jamie' died in the historic battle of Culloden. It was there that the Scottish highlanders bravely fought the English in a misguided attempt to restore Charles Stuart, their bonnie Prince Charlie, to the English throne, only to be decimated on the battlefield. Those few who survived were branded as Jacobite traitors and imprisoned, and their families disenfranchised. It was this very event that Claire and 'Jamie' had conspired to change, only to fail.<br /><br />Their story transports the reader from the turmoil of the Scottish highlands to the intrigue of the French Court and regales the reader with the adventures of the two lovers, as they conspire to change the very course of history. It was this valiant attempt that ultimately brought Claire and 'Jamie' to the crossroad that would compel these star crossed lovers to part and have Brianna become a denizen of the twentieth century.<br /><br />In \\"Voyager\\", Claire, now realizing that the love of her life and soulmate survived the battle of Culloden, makes the decision to go back in time and find James Fraser, as she has not stopped loving or wanting him every waking moment for the past twenty years. Leaving her daughter, Brianna, she once more hurls herself into the vortex of time to eighteenth century Scotland to begin her search for James Fraser, in hopes of being reunited with her 'Jamie'.<br /><br />\\"Voyager\\" tells the story of what happened to Claire Randall and James Fraser in those intervening years. It tells of their ultimate reunion and rediscovery. Against a backdrop of historical events and period detail and with a cast of unforgettable characters, it regales the reader with their new adventures, as Claire returns to a still divided, turmoil ridden Scotland. Reunited with Jamie, none the worse for wear,they seek to make a life for themselves. As their love comes full circle, they take to the high seas, and their adventures continue, captivating the reader once more.<br /><br />In \\"Drums of Autumn\\", the story takes somewhat of a detour, as it begins to focus more on Brianna. Back in the twentieth century, Brianna and her boyfriend, Roger, a Scot and college history professor, as well as descendant of one of James Fraser's cousins from clan MacKenzie, each independently make a discovery that stuns them. Roger keeps it to himself, while Brianna acts upon it. The discovery involves an old news clipping which tells of Claire's and James' premature deaths in a house fire in pre-revolutionary, frontier America. Brianna makes the decision to go to the stone circle to try and go back in time to change the course of history and save her parents. She does not, however, tell Roger of her plans. Roger, discovering Brianna's deception, follows on her heels and, on that strange, flat topped hill in Scotland he, too, enters the stone circle and is himself hurled into the vortex of time.<br /><br />Brianna and Roger catch up with each other in the eighteenth century only to be parted for a time, each having their own adventures. Claire and James by now are established homesteaders in North Carolina and are enjoying, what is for them, a relatively staid life. By the time Brianna catches up with them, an event has occurred in her life which may have the impact of forcing her to stay mired in the past.<br /><br />This fourth book in the series is a bit of a disappointment, as it could have used some serious editing due to the author's self indulgence. Moreover, the characters are not so well drawn, as they are in the first three books in the series. Unfortunately, a pivotal character, that of Brianna, is uncharismatic and comes across as somewhat vapid and stupid. Brianna definitely needs work, if she is to capture the readers' imagination as have Claire and 'Jamie'. At the stage of development in which she is, Brianna would be unable to sustain another book. The same goes for Roger, who comes across as somewhat one dimensional, though he does have potential, as he seems to have a latent smoldering and sensual quality to his personality.<br /><br />Still, notwithstanding some of these issues, this remains a compelling time travel saga, and my thirst for the fifth volume, \\" The Fiery Cross\\", remains undiminished. I only hope that the lengthy time span between the fourth and the fifth volumes means that the author has worked out some of the kinks in this new and developing direction which the series seems to be taking.der with their new adventures, as Claire returns to a still divided, turmoil ridden Scotland.

B000M53GM2|5.0|1995's \\"Goldeneye\\" was the first of four forays by Pierce Brosnan as James Bond; it can fairly be said to have revived the 007 franchise.  From its heartstopping opening sequence in a Russian Weapons Lab to its thrilling action finale at a satellite groundstation complex in Cuba, the action never stops coming.<br /><br />The movie opens with the standard pre-credits action sequence.  Bond and fellow agent 006 (played with blunt style by Sean Bean) break into a secret Russian Bio-Lab in the Urals.  Their mission is to destroy the plant.  They are discovered and 006 is captured.  Bond escapes, in an astonishing sequence featuring a motorcycle, a freefall from a cliff, and a small airplane, that would have been worth the movie all by itself.<br /><br />Bond's mission is to find and stop a renegade Russian General from using the Goldeneye, a satellite-based laser.  His search takes him from Monte Carlo to London to Russia and eventually to a satellite earth station in Cuba.  Along the way, he will tangle repeatedly with Xenia Onatopp, a Russian hit-woman (played with sexy verve by Framke Janssen); race a tank through the streets of St. Petersburg; and rescue a former Russian satellite technician (played with a nice mixture of vulnerability and toughness by Izabella Scorupco).  The final confrontation in Cuba brings him face-to-face with his long-missing fellow agent, 006.<br /><br />\\"Goldeneye\\" reshuffles the deck on the franchise's main characters, to good effect.  Pierce Brosnan is a highly effective Bond, believable as a steely-eyed assassin, but with that special panache so lacking since Sean Connery retired from the role.  At the same time, he clearly carries a burden from so many deaths, friend and foe.  Judi Dench takes up duties as the new \\"M\\", a tough-minded Secret Service bureaucrat who criticizes Bond as a social dinosaur but still wants him to make it home alive.  Samantha Bond is a sexy but updated and confident Moneypenny.  Joe Don Baker makes the first of several appearences as Bond's rather homespun CIA point of contact Felix Leiter. Robbie Coltrane cameos as a spot-on Russian Mafia hood who has an unusual reciprocal relationship with Bond.<br /><br />\\"Goldeneye\\" is superb entertainment in the best tradition of the 007 franchise, a nice mixture of action, romance-on-the-run, and understated British humor.  One wonders only why it took so long to get Pierce Brosnan into the tuxedo.  This movie is very highly recommended to fans of the James Bond movies.Bond's rather homespun CIA point of contact Felix Leiter.

006135323X|3.0|This book is doing quite well on the popular market, which is great for Ariely and a boost for the field of behavioral economics. As someone who enjoys slightly more than a superficial explanation, however, I find it doesn't hold up to scrutiny in many regards. (See the first review by Humble, which outlines a few criticisms at length.) Don't get me wrong-- I like the book, and think Ariely has done a good job of priming the public interest on a relatively new but potentially critical area in economics. However, other books/authors on this topic are significantly more substantial. (See Vyse; Hacker; Warren.)     Overall, content is 3 stars and delivery is a solid 4. In the end, I couldn't go for a 4-star rating, mostly because the book is a bit too fluffy, and appears to have been largely ghost-written (see acknowledgements).
B000000H6Y|2.0|Black No. 1 is an ok tune but this CD is vastly overated and superficial.  Beware before you purchase this one.  If you are a fan of cheesy metal then go for it but this one is.. well...  dumb IMO.<br /><br />The cover to Summer Breeze should be taken out and shot.  Goofy.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|This was given to me as a gift by my \\"as seen on TV\\" addicted mother.  The idea sounded great as I have 2 young kids, 2 large dogs and a cat. My house, with the exception of my bedroom, is all hardwood or marble and I hate dragging out the vacuume every day- so I don't.  Sweeping just seems to be a waste of time stirring up fur and dust.  I need something like this for daily dirt removal. If this was made well, it would be perfect.  As stated, it is not a vacuume, but a sweeper and is supposed to perform as such.  The problem I have is, like everyone else, my battery function is poor.  My mom bought me a new battery, so I have 2 poor performing batteries.  I am sure I must have left them charging longer than instructed, but who has time to figure out how much charge they need and remove them promptly from the charger when they are fully charged?  The batteries function slowly, pulsate, or just turn off after a few minutes.  The second problem I have is the hair cleanup.  Strings, hair and easter grass :) need to be removed every cleaning or so.  Not an easy process with the stitch remover they give you as a cleanup tool.  It takes so long, it negates the benefits of using the stupid thing.  The design is aweful, cheap and so not worth the price... but I still use the stupid thing daily as I have no better option.  Please let me know if anyone knows of a similar product that functions.  I would be willing to pay for quality.  I am using this thing partially to get my mom's money's worth!
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|A fine continuation of the first.  Sumptuous production, well directed and acted.  Elizabeth had many roles to fill.  Cate Blanchett brings off the disjunctions masterfully and with amazing imagination.  Geoffrey Rush is subtle and surprizing.  Elizabeth and Walsingham, Walter Raleigh and Henry IV of Spain!--there are few more fascinating characters.    I could find nothing wrong with the story.  I did a little research after watching and found that it is pretty close to truth.  Elizabeth did, for example, send Raleigh to the tower out of jealousy.  The defeat of the Spanish Armada had a lot to do with the inexperience of the Spanish command, but then, it was miraculous too.  I enjoy the ideas at play, the tensions between renown and isolation, authority and individuality, reason and coercion, between open and closed societies.  This is a script with some substance.    It is a dramatized episodic biography.  It is similar in form to movies like \\"Ghandi\\" and \\"Laurence of Arabia\\".  This series has similar appropriate sorts of pay off.    We're looking forward to a third.  Seem to have heard something about that.
B00003W8NM|3.0|Fight Club is clearly one of the best movies that came out in 99. Brad Pitt and David Fincher team up again succesfully for a very pop cultured film with plenty of action and fight sequences. Edward Norton contuines to show his acting ablity as The Narrartor.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Tim Burton's version of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is a feast for the senses!  I was captured from the opening credits by Burton's signature eye for color and camera movement.  The intensity of sound startled me straight into Todd's frightening world.  The bugs in Mrs. Lovett's meat pie shop made my skin crawl.  And I could almost smell and taste her horrid bill of fare!  This film beautifully brings to life the sordid world of the Demon Barber of Fleet Street.<br /><br />The cast is incredible!  Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alan Rickman blend voices surprisingly well.  Although none of the performances are extraordinary, they all entertain incredibly well.  My only regret is that this was a film and not a live theatrical production with the same cast.<br /><br />The Special Features are well worth watching.  From an amusing press conference and MovieFone interview with Tim and Johnny, to a featurette on whether Sweeney Todd was based on a real person, I was thoroughly entertained and even learned a few things.  This is a must for any Johnny Depp or Tim Burton collection!
B000UJ48U4|5.0|Eyes Wide Shut is pure Kubrick. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and having to explain the ending and plot to the people I saw with it. In a way you have to know Kubrick films to like this movie. I like it and rate it as a ten.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Cate Blanchette did an excellent job in continuing her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth.  The plot was well done, and the few inaccuracies (Sir Walter Raleigh instead of the pirate Drake) were small.  There were some excellent portrayals by the supporting cast as well.  Overall, well worth the time to watch!
B00005R87Q|4.0|When I walked out of this movie back in 2001 ,I remeber still trying to catch my breath after the movie was over. Vin Disel (should have been the next big action star) plays Dom a drag racer/mechaninc who is caught up in a stolen goods ring. Paul Walker(well on his way to being the next Rob Lowe) plays Brian an undercover cop sent to inflriate Dom's gang and try to stop them. The film also a subplot where Dom's gang has beef with an Asain crew lead by Rick Yune. Things complicate when Brian falls for Dom's sister played by the very sexy Jordanna Brewster. The film has a great supporing star in Michelle Rodgurez and cameo by Ja Rule. It also has some of the best car chase scenes since Ronin. Just go and enjoy this film.

B0002V7O3I|4.0|Explorers was one of the films that I loved in my childhood. The film which kinda flopped when released back in 1985 takes me back to when I was about 4 and realized I wanted to go into the movie making industry. While Ethan Hawke may have been the only one of three to make it big this is still a great movie and look for a young buy still sexy Amanda Peterson who would appear in the teen classic Can't Buy me Love two years later.
0060512806|1.0|This is the first book I have ever failed to finish.  This is out of thousands upon thousands of books, I read nearly continually.  I've read long meandering epics etc. and loved them, but this one just did not have anything going for it.    I only made it to page 300 and the entire time I was wondering when a plot was going to be presented to the reader, a central story.  A REASON to keep reading beyond just reading about these completely separated characters in two different time periods.  I kept thinking that the story was going to get started after the author introduced the characters a bit more, but at page 300 I realized that this was all the book was going to be . . . character introduction and lots of it.    Maybe these characters all tie together in a wonderful and thought provoking way around page 1000 or so, but I'll never know because the author never gave me a reason to want to find out.
B000RZIGUY|5.0|I consider John Woo to be one of the greatest action movie directors in the world,and \\"Face/Off\\" proves just that.However,the element that makes this film one of the most intense and spectacular action movies to ever come from Hollywood is the presence of two tremendously talented actors,both of whom are my favorites.Yes,when you have John Travolta and Nicholas Cage together in a movie ,the results are bound to be over the top. John Travolta plays Sean Archer,a dedicated FBI agent who survived a murder attempt by notorious criminal Castor Troy six years ago. However,tragically his son died instead of him and since than Archer is relentlessly chasing Troy.Nicholas Cage plays Troy,and the film begins with a spectacular chase where we see the sheer intensity generated by both these great actors,and you realize that this is not going to be just another action flick. Troy escapes,but his younger brother Pollux Troy(played by Alessandro Nivola) falls into Archer's hands,along with a floppy that contains the blueprint for a bomb to be detonated in downtown L.A. Pollux refuses to reveal the location of the bomb and then a desperate Archer is given an option that is so spine-chilling that Archer refuses immediately.Realizing soon that he has no other choice,he decides to do what he is asked to-to exchange his face for Troy's, and what's more,to alter his entire physical attributes,so that he can go to the prison where his brother is being kept,and fool him into believing that he is Troy and get the location of the bomb from him.The plan seems to work until the moment Castor realizes what has happened,puts on Archer's face,and sets out for revenge.He fools the FBI,fools Archer's wife and sleeps with her and just when one thinks that this is too much,the real Archer escapes prison and it's payback time. Both Travolta and Cage play their roles perfectly,and they do a fantastic job playing each other too. The rest of the cast simply fades away in comparison,and who cares ? Dominique Swain as Archer's rebellious daughter looks good on screen-but that's about it.Joan Allen as his wife is not too impressive either.Gina Gershon as Troy's lover seems much more real in comparison.John Woo provides the film with a novel and flawless script,and some of the best action sequences ever filmed.This film is an absolute must for any action fan,and definitely the best Woo ever made
B0013D8LOU|4.0|Although some have tried to argue that he was an actual person, it seems likely that the story of a throat-cutting barber Sweeney Todd arose first as an urban myth that was developed into an 1846 story titled THE STRING OF PEARLS by writer Thomas Prest. A year later the story was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET.<br /><br />In the 1970s composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim adapted a version of the story to the musical stage.  SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles.  Although it swept every award available, box office fell short of expectation and the show ended with a run of 557 performances.  Fortunately for us all, however, it has endured--first on the stage, then in concert, and now appearing as a film by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />The story, of course, is famous.  Barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns to London after having been falsely imprisoned many years ago.  When he seeks his family he is told his wife is dead, his daughter Joanna (Jayne Wisener) a prisoner of the lecherous judge (Alan Rickman) who sentenced him.  Mad for revenge and criminally twisted, Barker takes the name Sweeney Todd and is soon sliting throats right and left--first by necessity but ultimately for the pleasure of it.  He soon associates with Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter), who finds a handy way of disposing of the bodies: she bakes them into meat pies and soon has a thriving business.<br /><br />Given his penchant for the gothic, Burton would seem the perfect choice to helm a film version--and does so beautifully, especially in terms of design.  This is the underbelly of Victorian, fog-shrouded London, rendered in dark tones with the occasional splash of red blood.  The art design is nothing short of brilliant; the cinematography is all that you could wish.  At the same time, however, there is something very slightly amiss: although it has its own fascination, the film simply isn't as funny as it should be.  It is hard to say precisely why this is so, but it seems to me that the cause is two-fold: it lacks the satirical edge of the original and it has a slightly obvious quality.  Instead of being innovatative, SWEENEY TODD is simply Tim Burton as we already know him, and none of it comes as a surprise.<br /><br />The DVD release is quite handsome, with a huge number of extras and bonuses that are sure to please.  Recommended, and sure to find status as a cult classic.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewery amiss: although it has its own fascination, the film simply isn't as funny as it should be.

B0013BNY2Q|4.0|Forgive me if, at first, I just didn't buy the hype surrounding R.E.M.'s latest studio album, \\"Accelerate\\", as a return to form. I remember when \\"Around the Sun\\" came out hearing pre-release murmurs that it was the rightful successor to their 1992 \\"Automatic for the People\\".  Well, as I'm sure everyone remembers who heard it, \\"Around the Sun\\" was no \\"Automatic for the People\\", and was the record that made it look like R.E.M. was officially done as a new musical recording act. \\"Up\\" and \\"Reveal\\" were forced but featured a few nice moments, but \\"Around the Sun\\" was boring and listless, drifitng in and out of the speakers without much consequence. I figured that R.E.M. would continue to release lackluster records while playing fairly stellar shows of their older material and that would be that.  Well, I was wrong. I can admit it. \\"Accelerate\\", the bands first studio LP since \\"Around the Sun\\", is, like many have claimed, the strongest R.E.M. album in over a decade, a raw, fun blast of guitar rock that the band perfected in the eighties.  To find a record closest in the R.E.M. catalog to compare this record too I would have to go with \\"Monster\\", only conisistant. This record rocks harder and faster than the bands I.R.S. catalog, even if it sadly lacks the mystique that made those records so great.  Both Peter Buck and Mike Mills, the groups guitarist and bassist respectivly, seem relieved to be back in rock territory, and the riffs and bass lines are all strong and melodic, a mix of sixties jangle pop played with the vigor of a punk band. Mills also offers many stong counter melody points vocally, which is nice to hear as those have been sadly lacking on the last few records.  On songs like \\"Living Well Is The Best Revenge\\", \\"Supernatural Superserious\\", \\"Sing for the Submarines\\" and the records stand out track \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\", the band pulls out all the stops musically, and the extra heft provided by the groups live band, playing as the backing section on the record, givesthe record an immediacy that is appealing and nice to hear.  In fact, musically, the record only falters on \\"Houston\\", which feels like a better experiment from the last few records, but is the only song on the album that lacks a strong, consistant melody.  Michael Stipe has now officially become a great singer (on the first few records he was a great mumbler, and it was fantastic!), but lyrically he continues to falter a little. Stipe was more interesting when he was being vague and less open, and though \\"Accelerate\\" is less lifeless than the last few records R.E.M. lyrically, I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the more oblique Michael Stipe.  But that's more of a personal problem than a problem with the record. \\"Accelerate\\" is the best R.E.M. record since \\"New Adventures\\", and their most consistant since \\"Automatic\\". It reminds that R.E.M. where once a great rock and roll band.  And, if this record is any indication, they will be again.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|you have gotta check out Supernatural. At first glance I thought that a CW horror show would suck, but this baby doesn't shy away from the gore at all. The classic rock music really sealed the deal for me, not to mention the hot chick of the week vibe it has going for it. The two main dudes, Sam and Dean, who can make or break a show like this, are both very natural and easy to root for. The second and third seasons are much stronger than the first (which is also great, save for the episode \\"Bugs\\") with almost every episode ranging from very good to great. The \\"monsters of the week\\" are always interesting and the major storyline for the whole season really makes you feel the show is heading somewhere. So hop in the 1967 Chevy Impala and go for a ride.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I had low expectations for the new Rocky and Rambo movies, I don't know why, maybe I was thinking \\"oh they're doing this just to make a quick check\\" but that's not the case at all, both movies were very good.    I really liked this Rocky movie, and I never realized that Stallone's was such a good actor! Him and Pauly in the meat factory was a great scene, really gripping. The only iffy part with me was the fight, how it was filmed, it got a little boring and I'm not sure I liked the way it was set up to make it look like a real fight on HBO, it just didn't sit right with me or something. Still though, the story was great, acting was great, I gotta give props to Stallone! Definitely worth a watch.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Being counted out is possibly the best thing that could have happened to this band, as 28 years into their illustrious career, when R.E.M. had been relegated to being called a 'great band' in the past tense, the band have come out swinging on Accelerate. NEVER has a band this long in the tooth made such an angry, vital, and totally contemporary and relevant record. This is album is indeed a complete 180 turn from Around the Sun. It clocks in at half the time of the previous record; the drums are FINALLY back and in full force, Peter's guitar is fully plugged in, and Mike Mills' is finally harmonizing again. And lest I forget, Michael Stipe's voice sounds utterly fantastic. Just listen to him 'wow'  and 'ow' on Man Sized Wreath and yoyu can tell, Michael's playful sarcasm is in full swing, and he sounds absolutely energized, whereas he sounded tired on the last record.                          The songs are short and hit like a ton of bricks. If anyone remembers the anger on The Final Straw from the last record, well this album is like a full album's worth of that song with the amps turned way up and the songs at full speed. Living Well Is The Best Revenge is the best and loudest opener since Whats the Frequency Kenneth or maybe even Finest Worksong. Man-Sized Wreath is an unconventional but totally catchy rocker and Michael sounds absolutely fantastic and pissed off and Mike Mills backing vocals are terrific!  'Supernatural Superserious' sounds like the closest thing to a classic R.E.M  single on this record. It may not be the best song here, but it is definitely the most conventionally catchy song to be found here. Hollow Man follows and sounds like a total piano ballad until suddenly, the guitars come in. What a great fake out on the band's part and it sounds like it would be a great single. 'Houston' sounds like it would fit perfectly on Automatic for the people; very folksy...reminds me a lot of Try Not to Breathe musically. \\"Until The Day Is Done' is another folksy ballad that sounds like it would have been perfect on Automatic...it also sounds a lot like Swan Swan H from Lifes Rich Pageant. Its one of my favorites on the record and if it weren't so openly political, it would make for a great single. 'Horse To Water' is just pure adrenaline and definitely one of the best full on rockers the band has made in a long time.  I know it sounds like repetition but its very angry, and definitely a bruiser. Im Gonna DJ is a full on glam stomper that the band played on the last tour. Its a really fun post apocalyptic that not quite as Its the End of the World, but almost as fun and inspired nonetheless and its a perfect closer to the record.      Anyone accusing the band of making this record to satisfy record company execs, would be absolutely wrong. On the contrary, the majority of the songs are so openly political, that Top 40 will not likely touch them at all (if U2 cant get on the radio, R.E.M. wont either).  R.E.M. seems to be reaching back into the ire and anger of their indie IRS days, as this sounds more like an updated 'Lifes Rich Pageant' and 'Document' than it does any of their Warner Brothers records (with Monster being the exception) as it rocks aplenty, and it is a very righteously angry album except now the anger is placed in the Bush administration and not the Reagan administration as it was in their indie days. But, rest assured, this is not a nostalgic record. It is definitely firmly placed in the here and now. Also like Lifes Rich Pageant, this album is a solidly good album all the way through, without there necessarily huge singles waiting to be plucked out. There is nary a bad track on here. It is not QUITE classic album in the vein of Murmur or Automatic...but it is indeed a necessary and much needed addition to their discography and their best album since at least New Adventures in Hi Fi. R.E.M. are back and they're coming out swinging!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I´m in my twenties, my husband is in his thirties and we both absolutely loved this film! If you´re a Beatles fan you´ll love how they took their songs and wove them into a beautiful story. We loved the cinematography, the story, the actors, how everybody is named after characters from Beatles songs like Jude, Lucy, Maxwell and Jojo and we see how the nation grows up with the characters during the 60´s.  The political and social conflicts of America 40 years ago are very much alike today.  Hope you enjoy this beautiful film as much as we did! You´ll feel light-hearted and happy and in love. Absolutely beautiful. I don´t understand why it wasn´t Oscar nominated.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Part 2 may have been the best as far as action goes out of all three.  I like the story line and yes there were some holes but it is still a movie.  The Matrix series is one of those movies where it's basis was more about life and reality as we know (or maybe don't know it)but they used the ides of computers and technology to explain it.  Hence the coming of the chosen one to save the human race, the architect, and this reality not being our real home.
0810994739|4.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid was a breakout success in bringing kid humor into classic situations and an appealing format. One of my concerns about reading Rodrick Rules was whether there would be enough classic kid problems to fill another book with side-splitting laughter. Well, some of the best gags are gone but some pretty good ones are left.<br /><br />Diary of a Wimpy Kid featured humor built from not wanting to touch a piece of rotten cheese. There's no exact equivalent that's as funny Rodrick Rules, but the continuing saga of being dominated by an obnoxious older brother certainly will evoke memories and laughs among those who were a younger brother or the parent of two or more boys.<br /><br />As in most families, both boys have something they can use to blackmail the other. But Rodrick is much better than Greg at fighting for dominance. What Rodrick has on Greg is truly funny, the sort of thing that would deeply embarrass any middle school boy.<br /><br />There's lots of contact between the two boys because their parents want to bring them together. I could relate to the sorts of things I tried to use to create peace between two teenage boys . . . that didn't work.<br /><br />One of the on-going gags involves Rodrick's band and his parents fear of where this could all lead. Any family that's ever had a garage or basement band will relate to this part of the book.<br /><br />I was also amused to see the book address that perpetual middle school challenge . . . how to pass without doing any work.<br /><br />This is great fun, just not as side-splitting as Diary of a Wimpy Kid.
B0012EM5D8|4.0|This was a good movie.  A lot of the jokes will go over the childrens heads but it does have a good story line and it also shows children that when you do something how it can effect everyone else.  My 4 year old daughter enjoyed it.

B000AQBAUI|4.0|I was in a record shop in the coolest part of town in the former capital of the Confederacy, where I heard this band playing overhead. It sounded pretty good, so I bought it.<br /><br />\\"Growers of Mushroom,\\" which, I am told, was recorded in one day, teaches you how to make some good ol' slop rock stew. Toss in heaping spoonfuls of Led Zeppelin, Cream, Blue Cheer, Grand Funk, and the Guess Who. Also throw in a little Live at Leeds and Sabbath. Stir, simmer, and serve.<br /><br />Leaf Hound--which I think might've had some connections to drugs--contained the kind of guys no one liked to sit next to in high school. If originality is your thing, this band won't do it for you. I realize all these blues power bands lifted from the same Robert Johnson playbook, but if you spent time in the 80s thumbing through your parent's vinyl collection, Leaf Hound presents no radical departures. Most of the lyrics are in the \\"I'm gonna leave you woman/ you done me wrong/ as the train rides down the tracks/ I'm gonna shoot you down, baby girl\\" tradition. Singer Peter French can't shred as well as Barton Cummings, but he does a decent Cummings-Robert Plant-Joe Cocker impersonation.<br /><br />Okay, they're derivative, but so what? This was made in the hard rock golden age of the early 70s, when even the not-so-great bands were pretty good. It's one of those albums that call up all the rock music you've ever heard, and in a good way. Track 3 reminds me of Hendrix's version of \\"Machine Gun\\"; track 4 sounds like Big Brother and the Holding Company's \\"I Need a Man to Love.\\" \\"With a Minute to Go\\" sounds in parts exactly like \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" from Zep II. The title track, \\"Growers of Mushroom\\" might have been a lost track from \\"The Who Sell Out.\\" When the guitar parts slow down on \\"Stagnant Pool,\\" it predates Pearl Jam by twenty years.<br /><br />Track 4, \\"Work My Body\\" might be the best on the album, especially when the pounding organ chords come in half-way through. The bonus track, \\"It's Gonna Get Better,\\" with its emphasis on piano, sounds very different from the rest of the album, and it's nice in an early Rod Stewart kind of way. The last two bonus tracks are ill-advised. The band stumbles through \\"Hipshaker,\\" which might have been a good song if everybody were in sync. \\"Too Many Rock and Roll Times\\" steals the riff from Cream's \\"Crossroads\\" cover (or, if you prefer, steals Steve Miller's \\"Big Jet Airliner\\" riff).<br /><br />In sum, the band has enough garage band energy to make the album zip by. These guys are the kind of stumbling, unpretentious, sloppy English rock musicians that make it all worthwhile.Better,\\" with its emphasis on piano, sounds very different from the rest of the album, and it's nice in an early Rod Stewart kind of way.

B000026156|5.0|This is Holland's breakout album. It is very avant garde during an age when fusion was king. While not for everyone, the music is unique to the period and a primer for things to come. \\"Conference of the Birds\\" stands as one of the best concept albums of the 70s and was pivitol in Holland's development as a band leader and artist. The bass playing is top notch (as Holland's playing always is) and jives well with the other wonderful musicians on the disc- Sam Rivers, Anthony Braxton and Barry Altschul.  Overall, \\"COTB\\" is a great addition to a well rounded 70s jazz collection.
B001437DMA|5.0|I fell in love with this album on the very first listen. I knew it would take a lot to top Super Collosal and Satch has done with uh...whatever this album is called. This album reminds me a lot of Strange Beautiful Music only it's even stranger and more beautiful, if that's possible. Actually, Strange Beautiful Music would have been an apt title for this release. I remember when Is There Love In Space? came out, a lot of people complained that it was nothing new and that Satch hadn't really explored any new territory. That can't be said for this album. Every song sounds fresh and adventurous. There is nothing predictable about any of these tracks. I'd say it's one of Satch's most experimental albums, but it still has some of the most beautiful melodies you'll ever hear. The track Revelation is worth the price of the CD alone. I'd go so far as to say that this CD is one of Satch's finest. I absolutely love it!!! My only complaint is that it has a ridiculously long title. How am supposed to recommend it to people when I can't remember what it's called? :)
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Unlike many movies made from the books and stories of Stephen King, this one hews to the story better and is better for it. The characters are mostly well-developed, with a few exceptions and the FX are good for CGI. They're better when they rely on old-fashioned mechanical effects and I wish Hollywood would learn this lesson. The story moves briskly and the horror comes as a surprise and is actually scary and not just disgusting. There are a few false notes and I didn't like the ending but overall it was an enjoyable edge-of-your-seat bit of fun, which is all I ask from a horror movie.<br /><br />The character of Mrs. Carmody resonates with most characters in King novels and stories who have the slightest religious impulse. Invariably he paints them as vengeful and really makes them caricatures, which makes me wonder why he feels this way. She gets tiresome very quickly and I'm pretty sure a real-life situation would have shown someone shutting her up a lot earlier. This is how the short story was so I blame King for this Old Testament bible-thumper which is quite biased.<br /><br />The ending. I really did enjoy this movie, even the ending was okay the first time around but now I find it too close to the pointlessness shown in the ending of the original Night of the Living Dead. The actions taken by the characters at the end are at odds with their earlier attitudes and behavior and the second time I watched it I really hated the ending. The next time I'll just stop the movie when they stop their vehicle and spare myself the disagreeable ending. I wish they'd made an alternate ending like I Am Legend, the theatrical ending to that film was also senseless and out of character, but at least the alternate ending fit the character and story better. The ending of King's story was even bleaker than this but at least it did fit with what came before.<br /><br />Worth a rental at least, buy it if you like horror that is actually a bit frightening. Some of the minor characters come close to stealing the show so I hope we see more of them. The commentary by Darabont is one of the better ones I've seen in the last year - he tends to talk about the FX more than what's on-screen but it's still worth a listen.ng the show so I hope we see more of them.

B0007OCG56|2.0|In general I think Adam Sandler is pretty funny, but this movie is forgettable.  So much so, that I checked it out of the library a second time without realizing I'd already seen it.  Pretty much a waste of time.  Both times.
B00007KWHP|4.0|This is just a review of the audio quality. \\"Fragile\\" was probably my favorite prog-rock record from 1972-1975. I listened to it hundreds of times under a variety of settings, so I'm pretty familiar with the music. I heard the first CD version a long time ago and found the audio to be, uh, crappy. This 2003 remaster sounds very close to the original vinyl. I thought they might goose up the bottom and top, but that does not seem to be the case. Digital came a long way in the 1990s, so I think one can be comfortable with most remasters dating after 2000. If I were a Yes fanatic today, I might very well seek out a mint vinyl copy to compare, but since I haven't done that, I'll play it safe and stick with 4 stars.
1401216676|4.0|Is it one of the best Batman, Joker, or Moore stories ever told.  I don't think so.  Is it still really great?  Yes.  Should it be in continuity?  Absolutely not.  At least not with what I feel Moore had in mind.  I believe that Moore wrote this story without any concern for continuity in mind and I believe that that's why many of the people who have trouble with the book feel the way they do.  Especially about the ending.  After reading the book and thinking about it I came to one simple conclusion...    The Joker wins.  The book is presented as the Joker trying to drive Gordon insane.  I feel, in fact, that it is Batman that he is trying to drive insane.  And he succeeds.  Batman is driven over the edge by not just one bad day, but his second bad day and he has a laugh with and then kills the Joker at the end of the book.  At the same time, falling into that \\"dark abyss,\\" going against Gordon's wishes, and proving the Joker right all at the same time.    I think the fact that this obviously doesn't work in continuity is a big problem because it weakens the whole point of the book.  In continuity, since the Joker can't be dead, Batman can't have been driven over the edge, and really we are left with a disabled Barbara as the only effect of the story.  I think the book would have been better presented as a stand alone, along the lines of Dark Knight Returns.  The Joker gets the last laugh but DKR is so out of continuity that that is acceptable.      I think in this case Moore just said to hell with it and wrote his out of continuity story anyway, knowing that DC would absolutely not let him kill the Joker and have Batman \\"lose\\" he left it ambiguous.

What's your name?\\" *vomit spews* - - - This is what happens when you give a constantly shifting force of music (Sonic Youth) a corporate record producer and tell them to please their growing fan base. They please us... but we're the last one's to hear about it. If you've listened to some other SY albums, don't expect to find a familiar friend in \\"Dirty\\", it truly stands apart. The melodic insanity is there, the 5-string noodlings and erotic crooning are both there, but the package is somehow... SHARPER than the others. Sharp to cut, not sharp to impress. As you either know or will soon find out Sonic Youth is... well, Sonic Youth. You either HAVE to get it for your collection or you HAVE to distance yourself from the friend that recommended it. But if ONE SY album could fit in with someone's top 40 tapes AND someone's Sonicshrine... it would be this one. (Or Daydream Nation) - DV
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Ok, we all know about her problems, but despite all that Britney has managed to produce a very good album. Imagine how much better it could've been if everything had been o.k with her. Give her a break, listen to this cd - it's hard not to enjoy - and even Madonna says she dances to this. If it's good enough for Madonna, then it should be good enough for us. She should be able to judge what's a good record by now!! I hope we all get to see Britney further mature and blossum as an artist, not self-destruct. Haven't we all had enough of that yet already?
B0013FYTAI|5.0|\\"Scars And Souvenirs\\" is excellent! Another excellent CD from Theory Of A Deadman. All of the songs are excellent.    Track Listing  1. So Happy  2. By The Way  3. Got It Made  4. Not Meant To Be  5. Crutch  6. All Or Nothing  7. Heaven (Little By Little)  8. Bad Girlfriend  9. Hate My Life  10. Little Smirk  11. End Of The Summer  12. Wait For Me  13. Sacrifice
B000AJIF4E|4.0|It's really difficult to decide what pair of headphones you need. There are so many options out there, it's a bit bewildering. Thankfully, the mdr7506's can come to your rescue. I'm not an audiophile, but that doesn't mean I'm not a discerning listener. I was just an average college student, looking for good vibrations on the cheap. It was basically between these and the senns that are in this price range (280?). I decided to go with these, and I haven't regretted that decision yet.<br /><br />These cans are pretty comfortable to wear. My ears do tend to get hot for extended listening sessions, but it never gets to be uncomfortable. It is like a breath of fresh air when you take them off though. The 7506's are made very, very well. I won't go into any technical details, since you can read those for yourself. I can't imagine them breaking down unless I sit on them or something. Their quality is vastly to superior to my friend's Bose triports. His look like a toy compared to mine. I love the professional quality of the cable. This may seem like a minor issue, but it's really very important. the cable doesn't really pick up any noise from banging it up against a desk or wall for instance. It's also very thick. I hate those flimsy, thin cables found on lower quality headphones. I also like the fact that it connects to the headphones through only the left side, instead of both. I wasn't a big fan of the telephone-like design at first, but it's much better than having a really long cord. The padding is fairly comfortable, and the best I've every experienced on around the ear headphones. The headphones also do a nice job of filtering out external noises.<br /><br />The sound quality is great. The sounds is flat, but this isn't a bad thing. This leaves all of the tweaking up to you, unlike other competing brands ::coughBosecough::. the bass is pretty healthy on these headphones, and you can of course get more juice out of them by adjusting the bass levels of your songs. Thesound is very clear, with a good representation from the lows, mids and highs. It has really brought my music to life. There were so many details I had never heard using cheap phones. You will be motivated to go back an re-rip all of your music at a higher quality, because these phones will make any low quality rips PAINFULLY obvious. I've stopped listening to some of the songs that I couldn't re-rip because it was basically torture.<br /><br />These are great pair of headphones, and probably the best pair you can get without spending at least $100 more.<br /><br />*why a 4 rating? Well nothing is perfect, and I anticipate that the padding will eventually start to shed over time, as all good Sony headphones do.
B000RL4GS4|5.0|I thought hard rock was dead for the past 15 years. Airbourne is just what we all been looking for since the 1980's. A mixture between ACDC and Jackyl. I think they are almost as good as ACDC and Jackyl. For some reason- I thought hard rock was forbidden anymore the way the music industry has been pushing boy bands and sissy boys down our throats. Airbourne is definately a winner (I know because I was there  during the heavy metal revolution of the 1980's).
B000002HD5|5.0|This album is one of the reasons the 90s were the best years for music since the 50s. It's hard to find musical integrity and quality like this these days, that's for sure. My how things have changed... MTV use to be responsible for wonderful shows such as '120 Minutes' which showcased talent like the Afghan Whigs, Juliana Hatfield and Bob Mould because the music mattered. Now MTV and the radio is rubbish. But we'll always have 'Gentlemen' and the memories.
B000NA2776|5.0|I heard this CD while I was hanging out with my friend. She was playing it in her car and the second I heard it I had to know who it was!! It's that kind of music that everyone can enjoy because it's upbeat, fun to sing along to, has some positive and encouraging messages (Big Girls You are Beauitful!), and is a great mix of genres that makes it easy for everyone to like -- from my 65 yr old mother, to my 25 yr old girl/guy friends, to my 4 yr old nephew! Basically, if you dont like it, I might call you crazy.
B000YM4I4S|4.0|Two questions to Decca: why have not been #1 and #3 issued separately, and why has the Genoveva Overture included with #2 and #4 been removed? Weird. Thanks to Decca, I drop a star. That said, I own #2/#4 and they are very modern performances, clean, fast, dramatic. They are among my favourite versions (with Sawallisch).    As to the Mahler arrangements vs. original scoring: For many years I have been trying to convince myself Schumann scoring was not that bad, after all. But I can't -- orchestration is not only about textures, but also about building melody, rhythm, harmony, and so on, and except in a few cases (#2, mov. III, Adagio, with a very inspired Schumann, indeed), the composer seem unable to use effectively the orchestra for that. IMO, Mahler improved the symphonies (and he didn't touch #2/III at all), even if the way Mahler changed the harmony at the end of #2/IV sounds, well, wrong to my ears.
B00003CY6M|4.0|I am not sure how much I believe in serendipity - good fortune discovered by accident also known as fate, but this movie could make a believer out of me.  John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are wonderful together as soul mates that overcome every obstacle to be together!  They are successful because it was meant to be.  If you can't suspend reality, and just go with the flow, then this movie probably isn't for you.  It is meant for those that can have faith.
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|If you want to see a great performer, SHAKIRA IS IT!  I had the pleasure of seeing Shakira live when she came to Peru during the tour and watching this on Blu-Ray I got to re-live the experience!  The clarity was just that good! The special guest appearances by Alejandro Sanz and Wyclef Jean were neccessary to get the full effect of those songs and it worked out extremely well.  She had a good mix of music from all of her albums and the lighting and camera angles were impeccable. My favorite part however, was THE CHOREOGRAPHY! Of course everyone knows that Shakira can dance but with this performance you can sit back and take notes! This disc comes with an audio disc as well containig a few songs from the concert and extra footage, like the behind the scenes documentaries. If you are a Shakira fan, you must have this in your collection and if your'e not a fan, you will be after this.
0634060384|5.0|i really like this book it is essential to all aspiring and accomplished jazz musicians
0143038419|1.0|It amazes me that this book is so popular.  I got about halfway through the book before it got so boring that I just couldn't finish it.  I think Ms. Gilbert is self-absorbed and selfish and the book itself was boring!  I was highly disappointed!
B000PC0S5K|1.0|I ordered this book and when I began to read it I could not believe how the author (who has a past mental condition) could have ever had this published! The whole \\"Ego\\" thing and opening your mind to absolutely \\"Nothing\\" was quite disturbing. I question this author as well as Oprah for deceiving Millions of people who have no background on this material. Seriously, this book was written was falsehoods. I am shocked that not more people have researched Eckhart Tolles past and stunned that Oprah has replaced Jesus Christ for something covered with \\"Fiction\\" unbelievable!!!! I threw the book in the trash, it's NOT about the \\"Now Moment, we all have had a past that allows each of us to Grow and a Future that gives us Hope, with neither, there is Nothing!!!!! For surely the Now Moment is now past....Stop the DECEPTION Eckhart and Oprah....
B000PFU7OO|5.0|You don't have to see the movie to appreciate this soundtrack. I've been following Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova for a while now and there is a reason they won an Oscar for their work on this project. Truly raw, organic, and genuinely beautiful music. Everyone should own this soundtrack. Every song is a joy.
B0012QRPU4|4.0|This program examines the path that can lead a respectable man to begin, and continue, to raltionzlise behavior that he would generally see as reprehensible.  It also hoist the self righteous on the horns of their own weakness.  I recommend it.  An exciting examination of good vs. evil vs. good.  The story line stays together very well, the characters are believable....overall a good tale told well.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|Credit, that is. The amazing Bill Rieflin is the (unfortunately) secret ingredient; he's propelled their live shows to a new level, and his song-driven style elevates everything here. He is the a**kicking this band has needed for ages.  Therefore, it's a shock and disappointment to hear interview after interview, and review after review (Amazon included), giving him nary a mention.  Maybe next time around they can give Rieflin more creative input and earn five stars.
1416914293|5.0|I love this trilogy. i started reading it a little while ago and had to wait a couple of months for City of Ashes, but it was totally worth it.<br />I wont lie, there weret iems taht i felt like throwing the book agaisnt the wall, but never the less it is worth it.<br />My favorite character is Jace. His sarcasm makes the book better and better. I do wish that Clary took a bigger role in the story, i mean stronger instead of needing everyone's help, but it has to do with the fact that she's new to all those things.<br />Cassandra has really done it with this story. I cant wait for the next one next year.
0385720920|5.0|Victor Mancini is having a crisis.  He's dropped out of medical school, he's broke, and his mother will die unless he can make some more money to get her the care she needs in her nursing home.  He's also a perpetual addict who cruises sexaholic meetings for pick-ups and frequently makes extra cash by allowing himself to choke in fancy restaurants, then exploiting the sympathies of the Good Samaritan that comes to his rescue.  He also has something of a messiah complex.  And, oh yeah, he's clinically depressed.  Let the rollercoaster ride begin ...<br /><br />Palahniuk is a visceral writer, and the faint of heart will be quickly turned off by the explicit details of Mancini's life - so be warned.  For those of you with the stomach, \\"Choke\\" is an often brilliant but occasionally overburdened novel that is worth the strain on your gag reflex.  The flaw is that Palahniuk dangerously toes the line of excess, cramming in more and more where he didn't necessarily need it (if you want to be funny about it, you could say that \\"Choke\\" bites off more than it can chew).  At its heart, however, is a darkly amusing tale of a desperate man trying to figure things out, and if Palahniuk's ranting style can sometimes get abstruse it is also, often, grimly poetic.  There are a lot of great philosophical lines for quote enthusiasts like myself, which by itself makes the book worth recommending for me.<br /><br />\\"It seemed ... that you had to risk your life to get love.  You had to get right to the edge of death to ever be saved.\\"  That, in a nutshell, is Victor Mancini's quest in \\"Choke,\\" and you may just find yourself rooting for him despite your better instincts.<br /><br />Grade: A-
B0002V7O3S|5.0|First i would like to say that parts of this film were made here locally in oregon.    This film was of it's time a great sci-fi.  DB sweeney plays a great roll as the abducty.  if you haven't seen this film it's great.  I have been looking for this all over and finally found here.
B0010YSD7M|1.0|Warning to anyone purchasing the movie, yet unfamiliar with the series. There is alot of back story to this. Best not seen before the series episodes.          Love the SG-1 series (seasons 1-8). Not sure which writers were fired for 9&10 but they were certainly the best writers. Having suffered through two seasons of the Ori (a race Clearly capable of destroying Earth at any time, either directly or via proxies - yet unable to do so ...... because that would end the series), I was further disappointed with the movie.          In 'The Arc of Truth' they now produce a mantage of all of the very worst plot devices used by the series.         a) If you thought the Ascended Ancients were double-talking pacifists before, just wait until you see why they allowed uncounted billions to suffer under the Ori when their motivations are finally explained.         b) If you didn't already have a gut-full of Shadow agencies launching suicidally ill concieved back-stabbing maneuvers. You'll love what the IOA pulls. (Makes the viewer take solice in the imminent destruction of Earth, if only because the IOA will finally be gone as well.)         c) An old enemy (killed off twice now) comes back ...... again.           d) Deus et Machina. Only the Arc can save us. That and noting else.... sound familiar?........ for the third time now?             #1 Hunt for the lost city of the Ancients (was an origional plot at the time, and a good one.... then).             #2 Hunt for Merlin's wonder thingy that destroys Ascended Beings (Two whole seasons of futile defensive measures turned around in one shot). Masochists rejoice!             #3 The Arc of Truth. Find it or lose again (no matter what else you might do).                          They may wish to title the next movie \\"SG-1: The Latest Scavenger Hunt\\"               Or..... they can hire writers that do justice to the fine actors and special effects work. (Some basic math skills would be good too. ZPMs seem to be capable ofdestroying Star Systems in one episode and deplete themselves heating bath water the next in the Atlantis spin-off.)               The actors, special effects and legacy of seasons 1-8 deserve better writing than this...... much better.
0743496736|4.0|I'm a big Jodi Picoult fan.  I actually grew up near where she lives, so am always fascinated by her locales and also am always amazed by the amount of research that goes into her books.<br /><br />Overall I thought this was an extremely well written and well fleshed out book.  Overall I thought she did an excellent job of combining the different perspectives.<br /><br />Having read most of her books, I will say that I saw some of the \\"twists\\" coming. I didn't know what the big one would entirely be, but definately caught on that something was awry. In addition, I suspected the romantic relationship later in the book that develops early on in my reading. Did not make me enjoy it less, but I do notice that Picoult does use some pretty common formulas.<br /><br />Lastly, I do not recommend reading this when you are feeling stressed or at all down.  The subject matter is really heavy and because the writing is so good, it's hard to put down. Personally I was having a rough week and reading this during that time certainly did nothing to lighten it- in fact depressed me to a certain extent. Definately read it, but prepare to devour it qickly and try to read it when your mind is in a decent place!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I am not a fantasy film fan nor am I crazy about Princess Bride.  However, I needed a \\"light\\" film to brighten up my mood because I was sick hence the viewing of Stardust.<br /><br />To say that I was surprised is an understatement.  I was enchanted!  Especially after realizing the director is Matthew Vaughn of Layer Cake, one of my all time favorite films.<br /><br />It is not a short film.  120 minutes is a long time for a lot of people.  HOwever, the pacing of this film was so superb that I did not realize that I'd spent 2 hours without falling asleep or using the bathroom.  As a matter of fact, I saw it 4 times in 36 hours!<br /><br />As the \\"industry\\" would say, casting is everything.  This film did not miscast anyone, not even bit players.  They delivered the written words in uniform manner, not too seriously and not too casually.  The humor at times has a wink-wink quality but not to a point where it hurt credibility.<br /><br />CGI use is a must in fantasy films now a days.  I am so glad that in Stardust, CGI was used wisely, not over the top.  The real beauty is the actually location shots in Iceland, Wales, England, and Scotland.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great film to be had in your DVD library.  Both adults and kids will love it.  Highly recommended.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Just to disclose up front, I'm an IRS REM fan, haven't bought an REM album since Monster, when was that, 1994??? They lost me when they switched to Warner. Since this album was supposed to be similar to their earlier material, I thought I'd give it a try. Its okay, doesn't compare to their IRS material, and since I haven't listened to much of what they have put out in the last 15 years or so, other than an occasional song here and there, I don't know how it compares to their later material. I won't listen to Accerlate too often, probably as much as I listen to Monster or Green which is once or twice a year. And at 35 minutes, its not much longer than Chronic Town......    If you want to hear some great REM, try Murmur, Reconstruction of the Fables, or even Life's Rich Pageant. Thats what college rock was about back in the day.
0765318741|4.0|My twelve year old came home from school two weeks ago and informed me that his friend had read \\"I Am Legend\\" and that it was entirely different than the movie. Well, I loved the movie but I was curious about the book. I bought it and took it to work to read. Whenever I am reading a good book at work and my phone rings; I jump so badly that my heart pounds for several minutes after the scare. This happened to me many times during the book. I became one hundred percent engrossed with the isolation feeling that the main character was experiencing. Then suddenly...BANG, the story abruptly ends mid-way through the book. I sat there scratching my head feeling very perplexed. This is something that anyone who is considering buying this book MUST KNOW. The book actually contains numerous short stories. I still highly recommend purchasing it though. It was different from the movie and I personally feel that it was just as good as the movie.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I have had Blade runner on VHS and DVD previously and this version surpasses both.The quality of the image is extremely sharp and clear.  Viewed using a PS3 and samsung 1080p 40 inch LCD television.Contains every version you could wish for excellent value. Also this is a Region free disc set so it plays on UK blu ray equipment.
